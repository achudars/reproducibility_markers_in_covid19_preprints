"9" "The  COVID -19  pandemic  may have  altered  visitation patterns to  parks, with potential effects on human health. Little is known about park  use   early in  the pandemic, how park availability influence d   use , and whether park visits accelerate d  COVID-19  spread . Using  weekly  cell phone  location  data  for 620   U.S.  counties, we show park visits decreased  by  an average  26%  between March 15 to May 9, 2020 . Net of weekly   trends, park visits  were  2. 2 %  lower  when  stay-at-home orders  were in effect , yet increased  by  8. 4 %  with  school  closures  and  4. 4 %  with   business  closures .   P ark visits  decreased  less  during the pandemic  in  counties where park availability was high.  Levels of p ark visits  were  not  associated with  COVID-19 growth  rate   or  incidence  in the following weeks . Thus, parks serve d  as  recreation  and leisure   outlets  when schools  and  businesses close d ,   especially   where  parks  were   more  available, with  no  evidence of park use increasing  COVID-19  spread."

"12" "Government   measures  intended to promote  social distancing  and restrict travel  helped  reduc e  the spread of  the  novel coronavirus  disease   2019 ( COVID-19 )   (Courtemanche, Garuccio, Le, Pinkston, & Yelowitz, 2020; Pan et al., 2020) .   T he U.S.  federal government  issued  non-mandatory  guidelines on March 16 th , 2020 ,  later  extended  through April , encouraging residents to stay home and avoid groups of more than ten people   (Whitehouse.gov, 2020) .   S imilarly, s tate  and   local governments implemented a range of   containment  measures ,   such as   school and non-essential business closures , travel restrictions, and   stay-at-home orders   (Mervosh, Lu, & Swales, 2020) .  Due to  these measures and  individual  precaution ary behavior ,  travel was  substantially  reduced  and  stay-at-home behavior  increased  from  mid- March into April   (Andersen, 2020; Glanz et al., 2020) , with a verage trip length  decreasing  from about 5  to <1  mile/d ay   (Glanz et al., 2020) ."
"13" "Although v isits to  many  public spaces decreased  alongside   this  reduced travel ,  local  parks  and  trails may have remained  desirable to  residents  (Brzezinski, Deiana, Kecht, & Van Dijcke, 2020; Lu, Zhao, Wu, & Lo, 2020; Venter, Barton, Gundersen, Figari, & Nowell, 2020) .   Prior research  has established   a range of individual and social benefits with park usage, such as healthy physical activity and weight, mental well-being, and supportive social relationships  (Author et al., 2017; Cohen et al., 2016; Larson, Jennings, & Cloutier, 2016; Stark et al., 2014) .  During the COVID-19 pandemic, p ark visits may  also  have  help ed  individuals stave off the increased risk for boredom and anxiety  documented during the first few months   (Martarelli & Wolff, 2020; Salari et al., 2020) .  Recent studies  provided e vidence that use of  public parks, trails, and outdoor recreational  spaces  increased early in the pandemic , attesting to the value of these environmental settings   (Lu et al., 2020; Venter et al., 2020) .  These studies  used  large-scale data sources—namely,  Strava  recorded activities and  geolocated Instagram posts—to produce estimates  of park visits  for Oslo, Norway and four Asian cities ( i.e.,  Hong Kong, Singapore, Seoul and Tokyo ). Generalizability of  this prior research  is limited , however, by  the focus on major metropolitan cities and  reliance on data sources that disproportionately exclude middle-aged and older adults   (Lu et al., 2020; Venter et al., 2020) . L ittle is known about U.S. park visits during the pandemic and how changes varied by social distancing policies,  reduced time in other behavior settings such as workplaces and schools, and the  availability  of parks."
"14" "Consistent with a social ecological framework  (Sallis et al., 2006; Stokols, 1992) , we expect park use to be related to individual, social, environmental, and policy features of the unfolding pandemic. At the policy level, public agencies in the U.S. shut down m any state  parks,  national parks ,   and   public  beaches  during the initial 1-2 months  (National Recreation and Parks Association, 2020) . Other parks closed access to some facilities, such as  restrooms, buildings, and playground equipment ,  to  promote social distancing and  prevent exposure to contaminated surfaces   (Freeman & Eykelbosh, 2020) .  Such  policies  decreased  the total   a vailability of   park s   and may have  diminish ed  the appeal of   parks  remain ing  partially open .   In contrast,  policy interventions  that decreased time spent in non-residential indoor spaces , such as the  closure of indoor recre ational facilities and schools ,  might have  increased demand  for  outdoor  recreational and leisure spaces  (Venter et al., 2020) .  Moreover, the U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (2020)  recommended individuals and families  still  visit local  parks  during the pandemic  while  maintain ing  physical distance from non-household persons . Thus, policy measures taken during the pandemic decreased  access to  some park s  while , at the same time,  increasing  demand  for parks and outdoor spaces ."
"15" "A number of  park  environmental  features   may have  influenced  use during the pandemic.   First,  people  are more likely to visit parks  that are  within their neighborhood or near their home  than more distant parks   (Kaczynski & Henderson, 2007) . This  tendency  likely intensified  as mobility patterns were reduced , with survey evidence showing shorter trips for outdoor recreation after mid-March than before  (Rice et al., 2020) .  P ark visits  therefore  may  have  remained   relatively more frequent  during the pandemic in areas where residents  live  near  parks .   Second, peopl e may  have  avoid ed  parks   where  social distancing guidelines  were  difficult to follow   (Shoari, Ezzati, Baumgartner, & Fecht, 2020) , such as in dense ly  populated areas with relatively low park space per person .  For instance, the Norwegian data showed  that trails in low-density areas received the highest increase in use during stay-at-home orders  (Venter et al., 2020) .  Thus,  as decisions to visit parks likely increasingly prioritized proximity and open space, greater  availability  of parks  (e.g.,  proximity and   per capita  parkland )   may have  facilitated  continued or even increased  use of parks ."
"16" "One major challenge when creating effective containment policies  for  the use of  parks and  outdoor spaces  is uncertainty whether  such spaces  likely  serve as a vector for  the spread  of COVID-19 .  Although f ew cases have been linked  to  outdoor transmission   (Qian et al., 2020) ,  park closures and restrictions  we re  often  implemented to  encourage  social distancing and reduce the spread of COVID-19.   However, r ecent studies   provide support for the notion that parks and  outdoor spaces can  be safe for recreation  and leisure during the pandemic. In particular,  relative to indoor venues,  outdoor settings  provide  greater sunlight exposure, air flow, and ease of social distancing   (Burke et al., 2020; Chu et al., 2020; Ratnesar-Shumate et al., 2020; Whittemore, 2020) .   To aid in the development of effective mitigation strategies,  r esearch is needed to determine whether   U.S. communities with  high park  use   experience an  accelerate d   spread  of  COVID-19  over time .  Maintaining access to parks and outdoor recreational spaces, particularly when social distancing can be achieved, may be an important component of containment efforts while balancing needs for physical activity and mental well-being  (Benzell, Collis, & Nicolaides, 2020; Douglas, Katikireddi, Taulbut, McKee, & McCartney, 2020) ."
"17" "For  this  study, w e identified  three  aims   to address  existing  knowledge  gap s  regarding park use during shut-downs to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 .  In Aim 1,  to consider policy influences,  we  estimate d  changes in   park  visit s  within counties  during  the   initial months of the  COVID-19   pandemic  and implementation of  policies to promote  social distancing  (e.g., stay-at-home orders) .  We expected park visits to be constant during  the  pre-pandemic period  once controlling for weather ,  to  decrease mid-March through April as COVID-19 spread and social distancing   policies  were implemented ,  and  to increase   the beginning of May as restrictions were lifted.  For  Aim 2 ,  to elucidate the role of the park environment,  w e  examine d   whether  count y park availability moderated  park visitation patterns during the first few months of the pandemic.   We   expect ed  that park visits w ould   be  relatively  more frequent  in  counties   with greater  park  availability , measured  as  residents being more proximate  to parks and  having  more parkland per person .   I n Aim 3,  we test ed  whether  higher levels of   park  visits   within a county  we re associated with  subsequent COVID-19  case  incidence  and  growth rate."
"18" "MATERIALS  AND METHODS"
"19" "Data"
"20" "W eekly  p anel  data  for  U.S. counties  came   from multiple publicly available sources,   spanning the period from  February 16 th  to May 9 th .   Details for all  data  sources  are  provided  in  Table  1.   The central dataset is Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports  (Google LLC, May 20, 2020) .  These r eports  contained  estimated changes in visits or duration of stay for six categories of places, including parks and residential places . Mobility estimates  we re  based on anonymized cell phone location data  that are  aggregated to individual U.S. counties  (Aktay et al., 2020) .  Location data  we re collected only for users  of Google products (e.g., Google Maps)  who ha d  the Location History feature turned on.  S ample  characteristics  we re unknown, as  Google d id  not publish the number of users contributing location data ,  the percent of users who opt-in to Location History , or any information about sample representativeness or demographics ."
"21" "We divide d   the   study period  into  four pre-pandemic (February 16-March 14) and eight pandemic weeks (March 15-May 9). Determinations of pandemic weeks  we re  based on  prior research indicating the timing of increases in stay-at-home behavior and reduced mobility as well as the  implementation of government social distancing measures   (Brzezinski et al., 2020; Gao, Rao, Kang, Liang, & Kruse, 2020; Wellenius et al., 2020) .  In particular, a lthough there  wa s no sharp date delineator for when the COVID-19 pandemic began to influence mobility,  especially  since  the timing  of mobility changes  varied across geographies, much of the U.S. beg an   to  reduc e  their mobility patterns by March 15 th     (Gao et al., 2020) .  Similarly,  on March 16,  federal guidelines encouraging social distancing and reduced travel  were released   and school closures , typically the first containment measure,  were implemented in nearly half of the states  (Brzezinski et al., 2020) . The majority of other  containment  measures were implemented in the following two weeks  (Wellenius et al., 2020) .   Thus, mobility patterns and government orders indicate that changes in travel or mobility started around March 15 th  and intensified into April. As described below, we use d  a modeling strategy that allow ed   flexibility in the treatment of time to predict  changes in park visits for each of the separate pandemic weeks."
"22" "W e selected counties that had ≥1  pre-pandemic weekly  observation s  of park  visits  and ≥2  pandemic  observations, resulting in 657 counties.  This criterion exclu ded  2484  counties  or county-equivalents with   insufficient  data.   Because of  missingness  for  other variables, the analytic sample was reduced to 620 counties (7056 county weekly observations).  Due to  data availability  favor ing  populated counties, sample  counties   still  contain ed  78% of the U.S. population (~250MM persons).   Relatedly, sample counties are disproportionately  m etropolitan and include nearly one-half of Metropolitan  Statistical Area  counties (544 of 1180).  However, j ust under 4% of non- metropolitan  counties are included in the sample (i.e., 76 of 1963 micropolitan or rural counties)."
"23" "Measures"
"24" "Dependent Variable (Aims 1- 2 ): Change in  p ark  v isits.  The park category from Google Mobility Reports include d  primarily outdoor places, such as local  parks,  national parks ,  and  public beaches .  L ocation types  we re fairly wide ranging , however,  and include d  marinas, plazas, public gardens , castles , dog parks, camp grounds,  and observation decks , among others .   Published estimates of daily park visits cover ed  February 16-May 9 and  we re calculated relative to park visits during January 3-February 6, 2020. More specifically, the  county- specific   median  number  of visits for each day of the week from January 3-February 6  wa s used   as the  reference period , and the pe rcentage change in  daily  visits  during  subsequent weeks   was ca l culated  using the corresponding day of the week  from the reference period   (Google LLC, May 20, 2020) .  Daily estimates  we re highly variable , such that w e computed weekly averages to reduce  error in park visit estimates. We required counties to have estimates for at least 4 of 7 days and imputed remaining missing daily values as the county minimum daily estimate for the week."
"25" "As a robustness check for Aims 1- 2 , we obtained weekly data on visits to ~90,000 nature parks from  SafeGraph ’s  anonymized geospatial data for approximately 35 million cell phones per month    (SafeGraph, 2020) . Description of methods and results with  SafeGraph  data are provided in  the online Appendix ."
"26" "Dependent Variable (Aim  3 ): COVID-19  c ases.  We obtained daily county-level COVID-19 cases through May 23, 2020 from the New York Times  (The New York Times 2020) .  B ecause cases in the five New York City counties were combined in the Times data, we obtained  data  for these individual  count ies  from the New York State Public Health Department  (New York State Department of Health, 2020) .  W e  used the number of reported COVID-19   cases at week’s end  per 100,000 population  to calculate the  log of  weekly  COVID-19 incidence  since the prior week , as follows:   .  The addition of 1 is a common practice to prevent values of 0 from becoming undefined, and the natural log was computed due to expected exponential growth of COVID-19 cases absent effective interventions and the observed skewed distributions.  Weekly growth  rate  in COVID-19 cases  was  computed   and  log transformed:  ( .   Prior to counties having at least five reported cases, we imputed the growth rate as 0 due to  challenges in computing the growth rate when values are zero or small."
"27" "Independent Variables :   Social  d istancing  policies .  Dates for five state or county social distancing  policies   c a me from  a collection of  crowdsourced datasets and news sources  (Killeen et al., 2020) . Four  of the  measures  assess ed   encourage ment of  social distancing or restrict ion of  mobility: stay-at-home orders, bans on gatherings of ≥50 people, school closures, and closure of gyms and entertainment venues. The fifth measure reflect ed  easing of prior restrictions on outdoor recreation. We assessed when outdoor recreation restrictions were eased and stay-at-home orders lifted by reviewing source references from New York Times data  (Mervosh, Lee, Gamio, & Popovich, 2020) . For each of the first four measures, we  coded percent of the week the order was in effect  (e.g., receiving a value of 0.57 if  in effect  for 4 of 7 days in any week, and 1 if for the entire week).  When  both county and state measures were implemented , we selected  the earliest date.  For  outdoor recreation , we coded the date when restrictions  were eased  to represent the percent of the week   with looser restrictions in place .  A few likely errors in the original data source were corrected in line with recent research  (Courtemanche et al., 2020) ."
"28" "Park  environment features .  Park  availability  was indexed using  county-level  measures of  park proximity and  local parkland  with  data  from Environmental Systems Research Institute   ( Esri )  (Esri, 2019) , supplemented  with population estimates for census block groups  from the American Community Survey 2014-2018  (U.S. Census Bureau, 2019) .   To measure  park proximity  for residents , we calculated the percentage of county residents within 1/2 mile of a  local, state, or national  park based on block group boundaries.  For local parkland, we included  county, regional, and local parks  and computed the total  square miles  per 10 ,0 00  persons . Local parkland   was heavily skewed  (skewness=20.6),  such that we  censored the variable at 1 square mile per 10,000 persons (~4.5 SD units above the mean ; range from 0-1 ) and  implemented a square root transformation .  Park proximity  and local parkland  per  10,000  persons  ( correlated a t .54 )   we re a veraged  and the composite standardized  to facilitate interpretation of results .   In our hypothesis tests described below, we also examined park availability  measures  separately to determine whether findings  we re sensitive to the  measure   selected. Because  of  comparable findings for both  park availability measures , we retain ed  the use of the composite due to  greater  reliability and ease of  interpretation   for a two-indicator composite ."
"29" "Covariates:  These variables describe other  county  environmental and individual characteristics we considered as control variables in our models ."
"30" "County characteristics.  We  defined metropolitan counties using  Census Bureau designations of Metropolitan Statistical Area counties (coded 1) and non- Metropolitan Statistical Area  counties (i.e., micropolitan or rural; coded 0)  (U. S. Census Bureau, 2020) .  This is an important control variable due to  differential  inclusion in our sample  by  metropolitan status and  differences in the park and recreational  environment.  Residents in metropolitan areas may be more dependent on urban nature and public recreational spaces for recreational and leisurely activity, particularly during the implementation of social distancing policies that close alternative settings. Moreover, prior research on park use during the COVID-19 pandemic has focused on major metropolitan areas   (Lu et al., 2020; Venter et al., 2020) ."
"31" "Counties with recreation amenities, such as National or State Parks as well as public beaches, likely experienced especially large decreases in park visits due to the closure of these destinations. Because much of the decline would come from reduced out-of-county tourism, we include d  indicators for recreation counties and coastal location. Recreation counties are designated by the United State Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service based on counties scoring high on a weighted index of employment and income related to recreation and associated activities, and share of housing intended for seasonal or occasional use (classified as recreation if the county scored .67 SD units above the mean)  (Parker, 2015) . Coastal counties were identified using an  Esri  dataset prepared by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Department of Commerce, which we checked to verify only counties that have at least one coastal border were designated; this was necessary as the original dataset include d  some non-coastal counties  in proximity to the coast  (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2020) ."
"32" "Population density has been found to moderate pandemic-related mobility changes and may confound our estimates for park availability  (Engle, Stromme, & Zhou, 2020; Venter et al., 2020) .  We  thus c omputed population density as county total population (in 1000s) per square mile of unprotected land. Population estimates came from the U.S. Ce nsus Bureau’s American Community Survey 2014-2018  (U.S. Census Bureau, 2019) . Unprotected land was calculated from the  Esri  park dataset  (Esri, 2019) , excluding federal and state parks or forests and local parks from county land area."
"33" "Socio-demographic characteristics of residents.  We include d  multiple measures of the social and demographic  characteristics of  county  resident s using t he American Community Survey 2014-2018  estimates  (U.S. Census Bureau, 2019) .   These  measures  include d  the percentage of the  total  population  who  we re female, non-Hispanic white, youth (<18 years old), elderly (≥65  years old), and in poverty.  In the context of social ecological models, these  control variables  are necessary due to  socio-demographic  differences in park  availability   and   possibility of differential  use  during  an infectious disease  pandemic . For example, persons with fewer economic resources or that are part of an ethnic minority group often reside in dense, urban areas where they may live closer to parks than others but such parks tend to be crowded  (Author, 2016)  – potentially impeding one’s ability to socially distance while recreating.  Moreover,  residents in  counties with  a high share of  youth may have maintained  higher park levels relative to counties with a  disproportionately  elderly  population , possibly influenced by   age  differences in COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality.  Further examination of changes in park visits as a function  of socio-demographic characteristics is warranted but beyond the scope of the present analyses."
"34" "Analysis Plan"
"35" "W e  began with a thorough examination of d escriptive statistics. G iven differences in  data availability and likelihood of  sample inclusion,  we reported  county  d escriptive statistics  separately by metropolitan status .  We also describe d  time-varying county data by week.   To demonstrate the unadjusted trend in park visitation, we plot ted  raw data  by week  with a local polynomial smooth ed  line to demonstrate the sample trend  across the study period   (Gutierrez, Linhart, & Pitblado, 2003) .  C hanges in the time spent in residential locations  is included   as a reference  in these plots.   Moreover, p lots where raw data and local polynomial lines are weighted  by  county total population are  depicted  in  the Appendix ."
"36" "To  examine Aims 1 and 2 , we  use d  a series of  three-level  linear  mixed- effects models t hat  account ed  for the nested data structure (i.e., weekly observations within counties and counties within states).   We conducted all tests in  Stata 15.1  (using the mixed,  margins ,  and  marginsplot  commands ) .  F or Aim 1 ,  adjusting for weekly precipitation and average maximum temperature ,   we  first  modeled  the trend in park visitation   by week  (Model 1A) .  Consistent with other research   (Tsai & Venkataramani, 2015) , i ndividual week ly  indicators (i.e., dummy variables)  were included to  allow for flexib le  modeling  of  sample-wide non-linear trends in park visitation.  W eeks 1-4  were coded as  the reference category  t o  simplify the presentation of results and provide a more reliable referent  (i.e., week ly observations were   included   but pre-pandemic weekly  effects  were  not modeled).   Next,  in Model 1B,  we  added the  five  social distancing   policy   measures .   Because estimates may be  biased by  the inclusion of multiple  policies , particularly as most were implemented  in  a relatively brief period of  a few  weeks , we  also  modeled  policies  separately in sensitivity tests .  For A im  2 , we  examine d   how   changes in  park visit s   during pandemic weeks  var ied   b y park availability.  We add ed  to earlier models the main effects of park availability and interactions with weekly dummies  (Model  1C ).  As  the park availability*week  interaction  terms account for changes during the pandemic, t he main effect of   park availability represent s   differences in  park visitation  during the four-week pre-pandemic period (i.e., relative to county-level park visitation from  1/3-2/6). This model  is  also  adjusted for  county  characteristics  and socio-demographic characteristics.  Next, in Model  1D , to  account  more thoroughly for  potential  confounding  influences , we include d  interaction terms between weekly  dumm y variables  and county  characteristics  (i.e.,  metropolitan ,  recreation, coastal, and population density)."
"37" "For Aim  3 ,  we   examine d  whether  relatively  more  frequent  park  visit s   we re  associated with incidence  or growth rate in  cumulati v e  COVID-19 cases  two weeks later .  This  time lag  is  consistent with   previous research demonstrating  that  major  mobility  reductions  predict  decreasing growth in COVID-19 cases two weeks  later , given a n  approximately five - day  incubation period  (McAloon et al., 2020)  followed by another  five or more  day s   until  public reporting of cases  (Soucy et al., 2020 ; Vinceti et al., 2020) .   As our interest is in within - county variation in park visits, we include d  county fixed effects. In addition, weekly observations for  our selected  outcomes  demonstrate d  strong temporal  dependency  or  autocorrelation, particularly weekly COVID-19  incidence , leading to the potential for misspecified lagged effects. We  thus include d   first-order autoregressi ve  ( AR(1) )  disturbances using  the  xtregar  command   in Stata  (Bhargava, Franzini, & Narendranathan, 1982) .   Because reduced park visits may correlate with general mobility changes , w e include d  weekly  relative  time in residen tial places  as a contro l.   Similar to prior research  (Courtemanche et al., 2020) , we  adjust ed  for  regional variations in the spread of COVID-19   by including  Census  region - by - week fixed effects .  In sensitivity tests, we consider ed  time  leads  of 1 and 3 weeks for COVID-19 outcomes."
"38" "RESULTS"
"39" "Descriptive statistics are presented for sample counties by metropolitan status in  Table  2, and for county-period observations in  Table  S1.  Mean levels show that s ocial distancing measures were implemented along varying timelines with most measures in place by week 8. For instance, school closures were in effect for 63% and 98% of weeks 5 and 6 for counties (i.e., mean percent of the week in effect), and stay-at-home orders for 75% and 94% of weeks 7 and 8, respectively.  Unadjusted sample trends in  park visits  and residential stay are depicted in Figure 1 , and a c omparable plot  weighted  for county total population i s shown i n Figure S 1 .  These plots show that  p ark visits  increased  in  the four  pre-pandemic weeks relative to Jan uary  3-Feb ruary  6,  as  expected due to  warming weather. Park visits  started to drop  in week 5,  had the lowest levels during weeks 6-10,  and  increased  the final two weeks.   In a regression model, w hen we a djust ed   only  for precipitation and temperature, differences in park visits between pre-pandemic weeks  we re small  and generally non-significant (the exception is that park visits were 2.2% lower in week 2 relative to week 1 ) , justifying our approach to use this period as a reference.   Mean change s  in park visits during the pandemic  period  are visualized for sample counties in  Figure  S 2 ."
"40" "Aim 1.   Social Distancing Policies"
"41" "Regression results for Aim s  1  and 2  are depicted in  Table  3 .  As shown in Model 1A,  park visits were 10% lower in the first week of the pandemic (week 5) compared to  the pre-pandemic period,  followed by  2 6 -35% fewer park visits in weeks 6-1 1 and 17% in week 12  ( p  values   <   . 001) , averaging  a  26 %  decline per week during the pandemic .  Adding   social distancing policies   to the model ,  estimates indicate that  s tay-at-home orders  are  associated with a 2. 2 % decrease in park visits ( p =.0 35 ) . Yet,  park visits increased by 8. 4 % when school closures were  in effect  ( p   =   .003) and by 4. 4 % when entertainment  venues  and gyms were closed ( p   =   .01 0 ). When prior restrictions on outdoor activities were  eased , park visits increased by 8 .1 % ( p   <   .001).  Thus, despite a general  trend of decreasing park visits in the initial  pandemic weeks, counties experienced higher use of park  visit s when school and business closures  were  in effect . In sensitivity tests , we  separately  modeled containment measures , still  adjusting for precipitation, temperature, and weekly trends. Estimates  were comparable  for stay-at-home orders (B=-2. 66 ,  p =.0 10 ), school closures (B=8.8 9 ,  p =.001), entertainment venue and gym closures (B=4. 38 ,  p =.0 09 ), and  easing of outdoor activities restrictions (B=8. 62 ,  p <.001 ; not reported but available from author ).   When further adjusting for  county characteristics and socio-demographic characteristics, estimates for containment measures var ied  but inferences generally remain. The exception  wa s  school closure s, such that the estimate  wa s   non-significant  in the fully controlled model  accounting for variations in park visitation patterns based on county characteristics ( B=4.60,  p =.089;  see  Table 3,  Model 1D )."
"42" "Aim 2.  Park  Environment"
"43" "M oderation  tests   for park availability by week  are  shown in  Table 3,  Models  1C and 1D. T he main effect of  park availability  wa s not significant in either model, indicating that changes in park visits during the pre-pandemic period relative to the earlier reference period (i.e., January 3-February 6) did not vary based on county-level park availability.   As expected, i nteraction tests  we re significant for  park availability  by weeks  5 -12 ,  such  that  for every standard deviation increase in park availability  counties had   2.5-8.4 % smaller decreases in park visits  during the pandemic weeks   or from March 15-May  9   ( p  values   <   .0 1 ).   In a more controlled model  that  includ ed  interactions between weekly  dummies and metropolitan county,  recreation county, coastal county, and population density, estimates  were similar  for park availability  and  inferences  for  moderation  findings were identical   (see Model  1D ).  We also include Model 1D results for interaction terms between county controls by week in Table S2 of  the Appendix ."
"44" "The  p redictive margins  for count y park visitation patterns are plotted  at  the mean level of park availability ±1.5  SD  units  in Figure 2 .  Estimates for the  pre-pandemic period represent the counterfactual, indicating that park visits woul d have been approximately 35% higher  during the full  study period  if the temperature and precipitation days w ere held at the mean for weekly observations. The plot indicates the decrease in park visits  wa s sharp and coincide d  with our expectations  regarding  timing  of mobility  changes due to the spread of COVID-19 , yet  counties with higher park availability sustained relatively  more frequent  park visits during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S  relative to comparison counties ."
"45" "Aim  3 . Association between Park Visits and COVID-19 Incidence"
"46" "Regression results when testing relative  change in  park visit s  as a predictor of county  COVID-19  growth rate and  incidence  in the following 1-3 weeks are shown in Table 4. As our main hypothesis test, w e f ou nd counties  with   more   frequent  park visits d id  not experience  a higher growth rate  or  incidence two weeks  later  ( B= -0.00 2,  p   =   . 55 and  B = -0.009,  p   =   . 10 , respectively ) .  C hange in duration of  residential stay , included as a proxy for general mobility patterns,   wa s associated with  weekly growth rate and incidence . In particular,  more time spent at home  predict ed  decreas es in  growth rate and lower incidence of detected COVID-19 cases two weeks later. Sensitivity tests using one and three-week leads for COVID-19 outcomes produce d  similar results for relative park visits."
"47" "Robustness Check  using  SafeGraph  Data"
"48" "Results using  SafeGraph  data to estimate changes in park visits are shown in  the Appendix , Table S3 . The general pattern of changes in park visits during the pandemic relative to the pre-pandemic period  was  similar  to our main models  that use Google Mobility Reports , as  we re inferences concerning  each of  the social distancing measures  (Aim 1) .  F indings of smaller declines in park visits during the pandemic as a function of park availability measures  we re similar  to our main models (Aim 2) ."
"49" "DISCUSSION"
"50" "P ublic parks  may  promote   positive health  behaviors  for local residents ,  such as  physical activity  (Cohen et al., 2016; Kaczynski & Henderson, 2007) ,   and   influence  individual well-being  and neighborhood satisfaction   (Larson et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2017) . The COVID-19  pandemic  and subsequent mitigation efforts  presented  extraordinary  circumstances that  raised   question s about  how people  continued to  use parks.  Our  results show  that   park  visits   decreased  during  the  first months of the  pandemic   (i.e.,  March 15 t hrough May  9 , 2020) , equaling  an  average   26%  decline,  and in response to  stay-at-home  orders  (Aim 1) .  This  general decline in park usag e  should be interpreted  in  the context  of widespread park closures .   That is, park closures  and reduced park amenities likely contributed to  higher  estimate s of   declines in park visits ,  and  we expect that parks remaining fully open  experienced smaller decreases in park visits , on average,  than our estimates suggest.   Moreover, n et of weekly sample trends  and  other social distancing policies ,   closure of schools and entertainment venues was associated with higher  park  visits . P arks  may therefore have  served as a n  attractive location  for  individuals and families  wanting  to  get away from home and  engage in physical activity  or  leisure .  The  easing of outdoor restrictions  also  predicted an increase in park visits , further  supporting the idea   that  parks remained an important  even if  less visited  public  space   during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S."
"51" "Contrary to our finding of decreased park  visits , t wo prior studies  reported  increases in use of   urban nature and green spaces  during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic   (Lu et al., 2020; Venter et al., 2020) .  In one study,  Instagram  posts  within 1,185 greenspaces from four large Asian cities   were collected, representing the period December 16, 2019 to March 29   (Lu et al., 2020) . Instagram user IDs were  downloade d, allowing for  changes in th e frequency of visits to greenspaces  to be modeled for   more than 100,000 users . Visits to  greenspaces increased in the last half of March  relative to the baseline, and with higher number s  of recently diagnosed COVID-19 cases .   L arge nature parks  were especially likely to experience inc rease d  visits , broadly consistent with our finding of counties with more parkland showing smaller declines in park visits.   Another study found outdoor recreation increased by nearly 300% during the period of March 12-31, 2020 relative to prior years  (Venter et al., 2020) . This estimate was derived from  Strava  data on  pedestrian  activity  (walking/hiking/running)  and cycling trips  in Oslo, Norway. Although much of th e increased recreational activity   likely occurred  outside of designated parkland,  increases in pedestrian activity were found within forests and city parks.   Strava  users tend to be sports and recreation enthusiasts, and thus the generalizability to our own findings is limited.  Moreover, data sources for both of these studies included a disproportionate share of youth and young adults, demographic group s  that may have changed their recreational habits in ways dissimilar to  middle aged and  older adults.  Nonetheless,  Venter et al. (2020) also report  evidence from Google Mobility Reports  that likely reflect the general public to a closer extent,   indicating  a modest increase  in park visits  of 19%  but this estimate was  not adjusted for weather changes .  Reasons for the disparate findings  from our study relative to recent research  are numerous  and  suggest the importance of considering policy, environmental, social, and personal contexts  that influence  pandemic-related  changes in park  use .  For instance, o ur own findings  reported in the  Appendix   indicate that metropolitan  relative to non-metropolitan   counties  experienced smaller decreases in park visits . M ore research is  thus  needed outside of densely populated metropolitan areas , especially given the crucial role of the built environment and park availability in determining park use . The role of sociopolitical and environmental contexts  represent  ripe areas for further research ."
"52" "Levels of park visits across the study period were highly variable and trends showed heterogeneity between counties.  Regarding  park  environment features, w e find that  d eclines in park visits  during the pandemic  were smaller in counties where  parks were more relative to less available to residents – based on the  share of people  living  in proximity to  parks  or  the available  parkland per person   (Aim  2 ) . These findings  suggest  that , early in the pandemic,   residents   may have been  more likely to use parks located near home and whe re  social distancing could be maintained .  Although p roximity  to parks is an established  determinant of park use   (Cohen et al., 2007; Sugiyama et al., 2014; Wood, Hooper, Foster, & Bull, 2017) ,  this  preference  may  have  increased  during the COVID-19  pandemic .  Similarly, park visits decreased less  where  more park space  wa s available per person , a finding  consistent with preferences for u ncrowded park spaces  where COVID-19 infection  risk  c ould  be minimized   (Venter et al., 2020) . Thus, regular safety concerns and consideration of the surrounding social environment  (McCormack, Rock, Toohey, & Hignell, 2010)   were likely  expanded to weigh risks of COVID-19 infection   (Lopez, Kennedy, & McPhearson, 2020) . However, our measure of park space per person is coarse and does not include  perceptions of  park s , such that additional research is needed to  further  clarify  our findings."
"53" "Finally, we  find  no  association  between  county levels of  park visits and subsequent spread of COVID-19  using the growth rate or number of new weekly cases   (Aim  3 ) .  However, t hese results should  be viewed  with caution  and as preliminary   because  our analyses rely on aggregate data, such that inferences to the person   level cannot be made.  Nonetheless , t his finding is consistent with current thinking that the virus is  rarely  transmitted in outdoor environments  (Qian et al., 2020)  and that greenness is associated with lower incidence of COVID-19  (Klompmaker et al., 2020) .  Risk of transmission is influenced by sunlight exposure, physical distance and length of contact between persons, and airflow, among other factors   (Burke et al., 2020; Chu et al., 2020; Ratnesar-Shumate et al., 2020) , such that many park-based and outdoor activities  might  be maintained with very little risk.  Moreover, our  finding  that   increases in  residential stay  predic ted  decreases in COVID-19 incidence and the growth rate are  consistent with prior research  (Soucy et al., 2020) , adding some credence to our estimates for changes in park visits . Our findings therefore support p ublic health recommendations  that community members   continue to  visit  their  local   parks  while  maintain ing  social distancing   (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020) ."
"54" "Given the benefits of physical activity, park visits, and time in nature, some have recommended that parks remain accessible during the pandemic and that specific steps be taken to ensure park usage is safe while expanding access to persons in greatest need  (Slater, Christiana, & Gustat, 2020) .  Indeed, communit y members  have  questioned decisions to close  playground spaces for children when adult spaces in parks  remained  open  (Mishanec, 2020) ,   and noted  that residents without nearby park spaces  have limited opportunities to meet their needs for physical activity  (Francovich, 2020) .   Notably , neighborhoods where a higher share of  low-income  and racial/ethnic minorities reside  tend to have few er  acres of parks   (Author, 2016) .  In  these places , targeted investments are necessary to achieve equitable park access  (City Parks Alliance, 2020) .  However,  expenditures on public parks stagnated or declined after the Great Recession   (Author, 2016)  and park budgets could be decreased in response to the current economic crisis . O ur findings highlight the need for continued investments  in park infrastructure and services   to increase park accessibility, particularly in  areas  with  insufficient  park s to meet existing needs .  Our f indings  provide  support  for planning efforts to increase the share of people living in close proximity  to a park. One such example in the U.S. is  the Trust for Public Land’s initiative to advocate for all   residents to  have a park  within a ten-minute walking distance  from home   (Trust for Public Lands, 2020) ."
"55" "Limitations"
"56" "Our analysis has  several  limitations.   First,  Google Mobility and  SafeGraph  data are both derived from cell phone location data, and no information is published about the representativeness of the ir  sample s .  Although Google products, such as Google Maps, are widely used, l ocation data  for   Google Mobility estimates   only comes from  users  with  Location History  turned  on.   Despite being  off by default  (Google LLC, May 20, 2020) ,  we note that  certain functions within Google products  are  dependent on Location History being  collected  and users may receive prompts  to   grant   permission for  location tracking . We speculate that  a large share of  Google  users  have   Location History  turned on and that  our findings are generally representative of cell phone users within the study area s, but  data  are needed  on the representativeness of the population represented by Google Mobility estimates .   Second , m easurement of park visits  did  not include a comprehensive sampling of locations where recreation occurs.  Changes in recreational settings  during the pandemic  likely  varied by the built environment, such that some residents would have relied on   streets ,  private yards , and other non-park spaces   to satisfy recreational needs  (e.g.,  in areas  with low park proximity,  non-urban places and those  characterized by urban sprawl ) .   Thus, a more comprehensive examination of the spaces used for  recreational and leisurely activity during the pandemic is needed.  Third , Google d id  not release data on the total volume of park visits, rather ,  estimates refer to county-specific  relative  changes in visits.  A s a result, we are not able to consider  the level of prior park use i n a county  as a determinant of visits  during the pandemic  (e.g., compare changes in park use in counties with high vs. low park use pre-pandemic) ."
"57" "In addition, p ark visits are likely influenced by calendar variations, such as holidays or breaks from schooling. Two  widely followed  events occurred within our study, namely Easter holiday (April 12, 2020) and spring break (a school vacation for students of K-12 schools and universities). We could not separate changes due to Easter from week 9 fixed effects. Social distancing measures were implemented  prior to this date, however, and none of our inferences are limited to week 9. Similarly, we did not consider spring break as data on academic calendars were unavailable for the large set of school districts and universities included in our sample , and spring break dates vary across cities and states ."
"58" "Finally, there w ere  considerable  amounts of  missing data for park visits, such that our sample includes only a subset of counties. Bias toward large counties led to  the  inclusion of a large portion of U.S. residents , yet w e are unable to generalize our results to all counties , particularly non-metropolitan counties, due to data missingness from insufficient park visits to meet Google-established privacy thresholds  (Aktay et al., 2020) .  Missingness for individual daily estimates is likewise biased by low visitation levels. T o reduce an upward bias in  park visits  from ignoring missingness,  we imputed missing daily park estimates  as the weekly minimum value for  counties with at least 4 of 7 daily estimates. Sensitivity checks without imputation of missing days produced nearly identical estimates."
"59" "Conclusions"
"60" "Our results suggest that , consistent with social ecological models,  park use  was related to  physical environmental and social policy contexts,  even during an unpredictable and unprecedented time.  Park visits declined during the  first few months  of the pandemic  in the U.S.  compared to  the preceding  weeks.  The general decrease in park visitation is in line with research on overall mobility  changes ,  suggesting  that people  chose  to  avoid  visit ing  parks to  prevent  exposure to the virus  (Rice et al., 2020) .  However, c hanges  in park visits  varied  according to specific  social distancing policies,  as   policies  that closed alternative  behavior settings , such as  gyms  and schools,   were associated with more frequent   park  visits.  Moreover, d ecrease s in  park visits were smaller in counties where parks were  more  available, a finding  with important  implications for  human well-being  because of the potential influence of parks on physical activity and mental health   (Cohen et al., 2007; Larson et al., 2016) .   Thus, a s parks are valuable  community resources for health , and are among the few accessible outlets for activity during  an infectious disease  pandemic, it is important to understand  how  people  continue to use parks when developing and disseminating  social distancing   measures ."

"456" "Measures"
"457" "Secondary Outcome:  SafeGraph  Weekly Patterns .  For robustness checks of Aims 1- 2 , we obtained weekly data from March 1-May  9  on visits to ~90,000 Nature Parks and Other Similar Institutions from  SafeGraph   (SafeGraph, 2020) . In the  SafeGraph  database, Nature Parks and Other Similar Institutions are code 712190 in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Visits are measured using anonymized cell phone location data for a sample of ~35 million devices per month. We geocoded park locations to the county based on geographic coordinates, and aggregated total weekly visits for all parks within the county. We calculated the percentage change in total visits by week relative to visits from January 1-31, 2020. January visits were summed across all locations that had data during the study period (March 1-May  9 ), and were adjusted to visits  per  week to ensure comparable time scales."
"458" "Google Mobility Reports for park visits and  SafeGraph  data each have unique advantages. Google Mobility Reports are more accessible to researchers and thus better facilitate future research. In addition, inspection of parks identified through Google Maps and related Google products has generally provided us confidence in the correct identification of parks. However, a manual review of  SafeGraph  parks presently listed in the Nature Parks and Similar Institutions category does indicate incomplete coverage and some misclassifications. The assignment of NAICS codes, for instance, is made by  SafeGraph  staff based on names and the most logical fit, yet this is a subjective and difficult process. Nonetheless,  SafeGraph  data allow us to confirm our study analyses and offer a comparable outcome to the Google data. Advantages of  SafeGraph  include categories of recreational places other than parks, such as indoor facilities and golf courses, and data on the median distance traveled to the park location from the device’s home location (i.e., the most common location for the device at night). However, we limit our analyses to park visits for comparability with our primary analyses."
"459" "Results"
"460" "Aim 1. Social Distancing Policies:  SafeGraph"
"461" "The regression results using change in park visits from  SafeGraph  data are included in Table S3. As shown in Model 2B, we find that four of five social distancing policies are associated with changes in park visits. In particular, estimates show a 3.1% decrease in park visits when s tay-at-home orders  are   in effect, while closures of schools and entertainment venues/gyms were associated with 4.1% and 2.8% increases in park visits, respectively.  When prior restrictions on outdoor activities were  eased , park visits increased by  3.1 % . Inferences were generally robust to further adjustment for county and socio-demographic characteristics, although estimates varied slightly across models, yet school closures were not associated with more frequent park visits in the fully controlled model.

"463" "M oderation  tests   for park availability by week  are  shown in Models 2C and 2D of Table S3. T he main effect of  park availability was significant in both models, indicating relatively more frequent park visits in counties with lower park availability during the pre-pandemic period (relative to January 2020).   As expected, i nteraction tests  we re significant for  park availability  by weeks  5 -12, such that  for every standard deviation increase in park availability  counties had  2.3-6.3 % smaller decreases in park visits  during the pandemic weeks   or from March 15-May 9 .  In a more controlled model that included interactions between weekly dummies and metropolitan county, recreation county, coastal county, and population density, estimates were similar for park availability and inferences for moderation findings were identical (see Model 1D)."
