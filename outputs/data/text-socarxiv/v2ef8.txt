Abstract
Background Most governments have introduced various non-pharmaceutical interventions
(NPIs) in response to the pandemic outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) since
early 2020. While NPIs aim at avoiding fatalities related to COVID-19, the previous
literature on their efficacy has focused on infections and on data of the first half of 2020.
Still, findings of early NPI studies may be subject to underreporting and missing timeliness
of reporting of cases. Moreover, the low variation in treatment timing during the first wave
makes identification of robust treatment effects difficult.
Methods To circumvent problems of reporting and treatment variation, we analyse data on
daily confirmed COVID-19-related deaths per capita from Our World in Data, and on 10
different NPIs from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker for 169 countries
from 1st July 2020 to 31st May 2021. To identify the causal effects of introducing NPIs
on COVID-19-related confirmed fatalities per capita, we apply the generalized synthetic
control (GSC) method to each NPI, while controlling for the remaining NPIs, weather
conditions, vaccinations, and NPI-residualized COVID-19 cases.
Findings We do not find substantial and consistent mitigating effects of any NPI under
investigation on COVID-19-related deaths per capita. We see a tentative change in the
trend of COVID-19-related deaths around 30 days after workplace closing, public transport closing, and stay at home rules have been implemented, but none of them exerts a
statistically significant effect.
Interpretation The study enhances the literature on the effectivity of NPIs with respect to
the time frame, the number of countries, and the analytical approach. The results provide
further guidance to judge the proportionality of NPIs.

Research in context

1.1

Evidence before this study

Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly over the globe since early 2020,
and governments have responded with various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)
to contain the pandemic outbreak. Ever since, a considerable body of empirical studies
has emerged to judge the efficacy of various NPIs with regard to COVID-19 infections
and fatalities. We conducted a review of the existing peer-reviewed and ‘grey’ literature using the Web of Science and Google Scholar until 30th April 2021. The search
terms included ‘lockdown’, ‘shutdown’, ‘non-pharmaceutical interventions’, ‘COVID-19’,
‘SARS-CoV-2’, ‘cases’, ‘incidence’, ‘deaths’, ‘fatalities’, ‘OxCGRT’, ‘policy evaluation’,
‘difference-in-differences (DiD)’, ‘countries’. We only included studies that aimed at
identifying the causal effects of NPIs on COVID-19 infections or fatalities. Table S1 in
the Supplementary Material Part E gives an overview of the selected studies.
Several limitations of the previous literature impede the judgment of the NPIs’ efficacy. First, while NPIs eventually aim at avoiding fatalities related to COVID-19, earlier
studies on their efficacy have primarily focused on infections. Only ten of the 37 studies
listed in Table S1 investigate the effect of NPIs on COVID-19-related deaths. Although
studies on infections provide important insights on how NPIs affect the disease dynamics, they cannot adequately evaluate the main aim of avoiding fatalities. Second, former
investigations based on data of the first half of 2020 may be subject to underreporting
and missing timeliness of reporting during the first viral outbreak. Third, the identification of robust treatment effects of NPIs is difficult based on the first wave because
of the low variation in treatment type and treatment timing across countries in early
2020. Against this backdrop and given the heterogeneity in data used, methods applied,
and NPIs, time spans and countries/territories analysed, the results of early NPI studies
vary considerably.

1.2

Added value of this study

We enhance the existing literature on the effect of NPIs on COVID-19-related deaths
with respect to the time frame, the number of countries, and the analytical approach.
First, we analyse data starting from the second half of 2020 to circumvent problems
of reporting and treatment variation. Second, we use data of more countries (N=169).
Third, to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), we apply the
generalized synthetic control (GSC) method. Compared to traditional DiD methods,
the GSC approach attenuates the influence of selection into treatment based on pretreatment trends and models heterogeneous treatment effects completely flexible.

1.3

Implications of all the available evidence

The results of our study provide further guidance to judge the proportionality of NPIs.
Around 30 days after the introduction of workplace closing, public transport closing,

2

and stay at home rules, we observe a downwards shift in the existing trend in COVID19 fatalities. However, none of the investigated NPIs exerts a statistically significant
effect. Our results do not corroborate findings of previous studies with less countries
relying on first wave data, and following different – mostly standard DiD type – analytical
approaches. Yet, our results mirror recent findings using a conceptually similar analytical
strategy to attenuate estimation bias stemming from self-selection into treatment. Some
limitations associated with data quality and availability as well as the analytical strategy
remain to be addressed by future research.

Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing Coronavirus
disease 19 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly over the globe since early 2020, and governments have responded in various ways to contain the pandemic outbreak (see Figures S1
and S2). As effective pharmaceutical interventions (PIs; treatment and vaccine) have
not been available initially, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been the only
means to endow with time to develop PIs and to mitigate direct and indirect threats
to public health. NPIs include traditional epidemiological instruments like public information campaigns, testing strategies, as well as contact tracing, and the isolation of
infected and vulnerable people. Moreover, obligations to wear a face mask have been
introduced. Various of these lockdown-related NPIs have been introduced by a large
share of countries. These include also the closure of schools, workplaces and public
transport, restrictions on public events and gatherings, and more stringent measures
like stay-at-home requirements, including curfews as well as restrictions on domestic
and international movement [1].
While the potential benefits of stringent NPIs are straightforward (mitigate COVID19-related fatalities and maltreatment of other diseases due to health system overload),
they are likely to be jeopardized by potentially severe or even ‘prohibitive’ (World Health
Organization 2019: vi) [2] economic, social and public health-related negative externalities associated with the implementation of these NPIs [3–8]. Hence, evaluation of the
proportionality of NPIs heavily hinges on consistent empirical evidence of their efficacy
in the ongoing pandemic [9].
Ever since, a valuable body of empirical NPI-studies has emerged to judge the efficacy
of various measures (see Table S1 in the Supplementary Material Part E for an overview).
However, several potential limitations of the previous literature impede the judgment
of the NPIs’ efficacy. First, while NPIs eventually aim at avoiding fatalities related to
COVID-19, earlier studies on their efficacy have primarily focused on infections. Only
ten of the 37 studies listed in Table S1 investigate the effect of NPIs on COVID-19related deaths [10–19]. Although studies on infections provide important insights on
how NPIs affect the disease dynamics, they cannot adequately evaluate the main aim of
avoiding fatalities. Furthermore, underreporting of infections may be more pronounced
than for fatalities. Hence, it is favourable to use data on fatalities [20]. Second, former
investigations based on data of the first half of 2020 may be subject to underreporting
3

and missing timeliness of reporting during the first viral outbreak [14, 17]. Third, the
identification of robust treatment effects of NPIs is difficult based on the first wave
because of the low variation in treatment type and treatment timing across countries in
early 2020 [17, 21] (see Figures S3 to S15 in the Supplementary Material).
Against this backdrop and given the heterogeneity in data used, methods applied, and
NPIs, time spans and countries/territories analysed, the results of early NPI studies vary
considerably. Early causal analyses on daily COVID-19-related fatalities accounting for
population size and the temporal delay of treatment impacts find substantial mitigating
effects for the initial ‘lockdown’ [12, 14], school closure [10, 13, 18, 19], workplace closure
[18, 19], cancellation of public events [18], stay-at-home orders [16], travel restrictions
[15], and mask obligations [11, 15]. However, all these studies are based on data of the
first wave. Only one study [17] investigates fatalities after the first half of 2020 (August
2020 to January 2021). Based on a hierarchical Bayesian transmission model applied
to 7 countries/114 subnational entities, the study [17] identifies substantial mitigating
effects for school closure, workplace closure, and firm restrictions on gatherings (see
Table S1).
We enhance the existing literature on the effect of NPIs on COVID-19-related deaths
with respect to the time frame, the number of countries, and the analytical method.
First, we analyse data starting from the second half of 2020 (1st July 2020 to 31st
May 2021) to circumvent problems of reporting and treatment variation. Variation in
treatment timing is sufficiently high between countries in this time span (Figures S3 to
S12). Second, compared to other studies [17], we use data of more countries (N= 169)
covering 98% of the world population. Third, to estimate the average treatment effect on
the treated (ATT), we apply the Generalized Synthetic Control (GSC) method [22]. The
GSC approach is a combination of the synthetic control approach [23–25] and traditional
difference-in-differences (DiD) methods. Compared to traditional DiD methods [26],
the synthetic control method aims at re-weighting the estimation sample to account for
differences in pre-treatment trends between treated and untreated units, which are likely
to influence the post-treatment trajectory of the outcome. Hence, the method helps
to attenuate the influence of selection into treatment. To further address treatment
selection by COVID-19 cases per capita, we control for COVID-19 cases residualized by
past NPI implementations, following a regression-with-residuals approach [27, 28]. The
analytical strategy also models flexible post-treatment trajectories, thereby revealing
the temporal dynamics of NPI efficacy without prior assumptions.

3.1

Methods
Data

We combine different data sources on the country level (N = 169 countries). First, we
derive daily information on confirmed COVID-19 deaths per capita from Our World
in Data [29]. Second, we add daily information on various NPIs and governmental
stringency from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) [1].

4

Our main outcome measure is the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 per million
inhabitants. This information is collected from various sources and mainly relies on
official data provided by single countries or country groups. Our analytical strategy
accounts for the fact that the absolute number of deaths may depend on the reporting
standards of each country. For our main analysis we rely on the raw daily number of
deaths per capita. We coded all days as missing on which a country reported a negative
number of deaths, which happened in a few instances when countries corrected earlier
numbers.
From OxCGRT [1] we use the following 10 NPIs: school closing, workplace closing,
closure of public transport, stay at home rules, restriction of internal movement, restrictions on international travel, protection of the elderly, testing policy, contact tracing,
mask obligations. We do not report results on cancellation of public events, restrictions
on gatherings, and public information campaigns as these NPIs lack sufficient variation
in treatment status and timing throughout the whole sequences (Figures S13 - S15). OxCGRT codes a country’s stringency in each of these domains with different categories.
For our main analyses we recoded all NPIs as binary indicators, taking the value one
(implemented) if a country is in the highest available category of each measure on a
given day, and zero otherwise. Supplementary Figures S3 to S12 depict the stringency
sequences for each NPI.

3.2

Analytical strategy

Unobserved differences between countries and temporal shocks likely influence the number of COVID-19 related cases and deaths. Hence, a natural choice would be a differencein-differences (DiD) like estimator [30], solely relying on within country and period variances for identification [30, 31]. However, conventional within-estimators face several
methodological challenges when aiming at identifying the impact of NPIs on COVID-19
related fatalities, such as selection on pre-treatment trends or treatment effect heterogeneity [26, 32–34].
We tackle this problem by applying a Generalized Synthetic Control (GSC) method
[22]. The intuitive idea behind the conventional Synthetic Control method is to construct a synthetic control unit for a single treated unit by re-weighting observations
from the pool of control-units [23–25]. Among other characteristics, the re-weighting is
based on the pre-treatment pathway of the outcome. The method thus compares the
treatment unit to a weighted control-pool which, on average, has a similar pre-treatment
outcome trajectory. Moreover, by predicting the couterfactual outcome for the treated
observations, heterogeneous treatment effects over time are flexibly identified.
The traditional Synthetic Control approach applies only to the case of one treated
unit. Yet, the GSC method [22] provides a framework which generalizes the synthetic
control method to multiple treated units by using factor augmented models. We start
with the general model
Yit = δit Dit + Xit β + Lit + it ,

5

(1)

where Yit is the dependent variable (fatalities per capita), Xit are time-varying controls,
and it the idiosyncratic error. Dit is a binary treatment indicator, and δit denotes the
treatment effect for each unit and time-period, with δ̄it being the average treatment effect
on the treated (ATT). Lit subsumes unobserved factors approximating the outcome
trend. The original GSC method based on interactive fixed effects models directly
estimates L = ΛF , with Λ being an N × r matrix of unknown factor loadings (unitspecific intercepts), and F an r × T matrix of unobserved common factors (time-varying
coefficients) [22]. This however requires the number of factors r to be specified correctly,
for instance by using cross-validation methods.
In contrast to interactive fixed effects models, the matrix completion method [35] does
not estimate Λ and F , but directly estimates L̂ based on nuclear norm regularization.
Intuitively, L̂ is derived by minimizing the sum of square differences between Yit and Lit
(plus non-regularized unit and time fixed effects) based on pre-treatment observations
while adding a penalty term λ k L k – similar to the Least Absolute Shrinkage and
Selection Operator (LASSO) estimator. The matrix completion method in GSC is used
to estimate the ATT in the following way [22, 36]. First, β̂ and L̂ are estimated based
on the pool of control units, where λ is determined by cross-validation [35]. Here,
we use 20 possible λ values and 10-fold cross-validation. Second, the counterfactual
outcome for the treated units is estimated by Ŷit (D = 0) = Xit β̂ + L̂it . Third, based
on the predicted counterfactual outcome, we can then estimate the ATT δ̂it = Yit (D =
1) − Ŷit (D = 0). For inferential statistics, we provide confidence intervals based on
non-parametric bootstraps of 1,000 runs clustered at the country level (see below). For
estimation, we use the R package gsynth v.1.1.9 [22].
One limitation of GSC in our case is that the method is designed for settings of staggered treatment adoption. Countries can, however, transition from treatment (having
an NPI implemented) to control (relaxing the NPI), and going back to treatment (see
Supplement B for treatment sequences). Thus, we divide our data into country-period
splits, where a country is treated as a new unit with each transition from treatment to
control. A single country can, for instance, act as treated unit in early periods and as
control unit in later periods. This also ensures that we do not conflate our temporal
treatment effect of implementation with relaxations of NPIs.
To analyse the effectiveness of each single NPIi with i ∈ {1, ..., 10}, we simultaneously control for the stringency index in all other NPIs: Indexj , j 6= i. We follow the OxCGRT methodology for normalized sub-index scores by defining Indexj =
100

vj −0.5(max{0,Fj −fj })
,
Nvj

where vj is the current category of the measure, Nvj the max-

imum category (highest stringency), fj a binary flag indicating whether a measure is
geographically targeted (0) or general (1), and Fj indicates if measure j has a flag or
not (e.g. international travel restrictions are always general). We control for the cumulative number of vaccinations per capita [29], as vaccinations likely affect both – the
implementation of NPIs and the number of fatalities. Because COVID-19 transmissions
[37–39] as well as COVID-19 related morbidity [40] might be correlated with seasonal
weather conditions, we also control for the monthly average temperature and temperature squared, cloud cover, specific humidity, and precipitation. These data were derived

6

from the ERA5 reanalysis data based on Copernicus Climate observations [41].
Moreover, we control for temporal lags of residualized COVID-19 cases. Besides
the COVID-19 deaths, also the cases are likely to impose a strong effect on the likelihood of implementing NPIs. However, naively controlling for cases would lead to
an overcontrol-bias, as NPIs reduce deaths not only directly but also through a reduction in infections. We thus follow a regression-with-residuals approach [27, 28],
making COVID-19 cases orthogonal to past NPI implementations. More specifically,
we first regress cases on various time-lags of NPIs within countries and time-periods:
P10 P35
Casesit = k=1 l=7 NPIkit−l + αi + ξt for all K NPIs and L temporal lags, where αi
and ξt are country and time fixed effects. Subsequently, we derive the residuals of this
first-stage regression. This leaves us with the residualized COVID-19 cases which are
independent of NPI implementations within the past 7-35 days. In our main analysis, we
control for the residualized 7-day backwards rolling average of residualized COVID-19
cases at five different temporal lags: t − 7, t − 14, t − 21, t − 28, and t − 35, including second and third order polynomials. The high number of lags in the first and second stage
intends to relax a-priori assumptions on the temporal dependency between COVID-19
cases, deaths, and NPIs. Controlling for the residualized number of COVID-19 cases
notably reduces the pre-treatment differences in control and treatment group (see Figure
S16 for results without controlling for residualized cases).

Results

Relying on the analytical approach above, we observe that none of the strictly implemented NPIs under investigation had a substantial and consistent mitigating effect on
COVID-19-attributed deaths per million capita over time (see Figure 1). None of the
post-treatment trajectories differs significantly from the null-line. Even when comparing
the post-treatment trajectories to the linear extrapolation of the 35-days pre-treatment
period (dashed line), only the closure of public transport produces significant differences. Compared to the extrapolation of the pre-treatment trend, COVID-19-attributed
deaths are significantly lower within day 45 to day 90 after implementation, with the
daily number of deaths per million being 0.9 lower on average. For a country with 45
mio inhabitants, this would sum to 1,884 avoided deaths [95% CI: -3,762 to -5] within
days 45 to 90. Note however that this estimate reduces to one third (630 [95% CI: -2,509
to 1,248]) if compared to the null-line instead of the pre-treatment trend.
Although we can hardly detect any significant reduction in COVID-19-attributed
deaths, Figure 1 depicts one striking similarity among workplace closing, closure of public transport and stay at home rules. In all cases, fatalities continue to raise up to
around day 30 after implementation. From day 30 on, however, the trajectories change
and fatalities start to fall, reaching a low level until day 90 after implementation (school
closing follows a slightly less clear but comparable trajectory). Obviously, the initial
raise in fatalities is not caused by the NPI implementation, but results from implementing countries being on particularly bad trajectories compared to non-implementing
countries. We just do not have control countries on even worse trajectories to level out

Days since intervention

Figure 1: The effect of NPIs on COVID-19 deaths. Generalized synthetic control estimator based on daily data. Black solid lines represent the average treatment effects on
the treated (ATTs). Ribbons represent 95% non-parametric confidence intervals based
on 1,000 bootstrap runs. Dotted lines are the null lines. Dashed lines represent linear
predictions based on the 35 days before the intervention. Controls: 9 remaining NPIs as
stringency index, temperature, temperature2 , cloud cover, precipitation, humidity, total
vaccinations, 7-day backwards rolling average of NPI-residualized COVID-19 cases at
t − 7, t − 14, t − 21, t − 28, and t − 35.
these differences on average. Given the time-lag in infections, severe symptoms, and
fatalities (or reporting thereof), an impact on the overall trajectory after 30 days seems
plausible. However, whether or not taking this as evidence for a mitigating effect depends on whether or not we assume that the initial raise would have continued without
the NPI – an assumption we cannot test adequately based on the available data.
Note that supplementary analyses (Figure S24) also depict a relatively strong change
in the trend of COVID-19-related cases due to strict workplace closings, closure of public
transport, stay at home order, and restrictions on internal movement. Yet again, we do
not find trajectories falling significantly below the null-line.
We conducted a number of robustness checks (see Supplementary Material C). First,
we were concerned that spatial spillovers could affect our results [42]. Thus, we additionally controlled for NPI implementations in neighbouring countries. The results
indicate that spatial spillovers do not alter the results substantially on the national level

8

(see Figure S17). Second, we coded the highest two categories as intervention. Results
(Figure S18) do not indicate meaningful influences on fatalities, with the one exception
of contact tracing. Note however that this result is very unstable, as we lack a sufficient
number of control units: nearly all countries had already implemented a less stringent
version of contact tracing by July 2020 (Figure S11). Third, the results remain stable
when controlling for the number of other implemented interventions instead of a stringency index (see Figure S19). Fourth, we tested if results differ when using first-wave
data only. Results with data before September 2020 (Figure S20) deviate from our main
findings only with regard to restrictions on internal movement. With first wave data,
we observe a downturn in fatalities after restrictions on internal movement. However,
the ATT is estimated with large insecurity. Fifth, we checked if our results depend on
treatment timing. It is reasonable to assume that the implementation of NPIs in an
early phase of the viral outbreak is more effective [19, 43]. We therefore re-estimated
our models separately for early and late adopters. We calculated the 7-day backwards
rolling average of fatalities at treatment intervention and defined units below (above)
the overall median as early (late) adopters. For early adopters (Figure S21), the results
indicate that comprehensive contact tracing had a small but significant mitigating effect
as compared to the pre-treatment trend. For the other nine NPIs under investigation,
we do not find mitigating effects among early adopters. In absolute terms, late adopters
(Figure S22) seem to experience stronger effects on their trends in COVID-19-related
fatalities – especially for closure of public transport and stay at home rules. However,
none of the NPIs differ significantly from the null-line.

5

Discussion

Based on the applied GSC approach, we do not find substantially mitigating effects of
the ten NPIs under investigation on COVID-19-related deaths per capita. We see a
tentative change in the trend of COVID-19-related deaths starting around 30 days after
workplace closing, public transport closing, and stay at home rules have been introduced,
but none of them exerts a statistically significant effect.
Our results do not corroborate the findings of former studies with less countries relying on first wave data, and following different, mostly DiD type analytical approaches
on school closures [10, 13, 17–19], workplace closures [17–19], stay at home orders [16,
18], restrictions on international travel [15], and mask obligations [11, 15]. These differences may also emerge from underreporting and missing timeliness of reporting of
fatalities during the first viral outbreak [14, 17]. Yet, our results mirror the findings
of a recent study [34] following a conceptually similar analytical strategy to attenuate
estimation bias stemming from self-selection into treatment while investigating the effect
of 46 US state-level shelter-in-place orders on COVID-19 cases. In contrast to a DiD
type approach, the study [34] finds no significant impacts of shelter-in-place orders on
COVID-19 cases.
Nonetheless, our estimates might be subject to several issues. First, data quality for
both COVID-19-related fatalities and NPIs are far from perfect. There might still be
9

underreporting of COVID-19-related deaths in non-hospitalized fatalities [20]. Second,
the local context associated with the specific implementation of NPIs (e.g. school closure) might influence our results, as the relatively broad categories of OxCGRT might
not capture variation in implementation, e.g. across subnational territories [21]. Third,
differences in population-wide compliance to NPIs might serve as an explanation for
our findings [44, 45]. This is more likely for mask obligations, contact tracing, testing
policies, protecting elderly, and domestic travel restrictions. For instance, the tentative downwards trend after internal movement restrictions during the first wave (Figure
S20) may indicate higher compliance during this period compared to later periods. However, compliance rates are unlikely to serve as substantial explanation for the absence
of mitigating effects of school and workplace closings, the closure of public transport,
and restrictions on international travel. Fourth, our statistical approach complicates
the investigation of simultaneous NPI implementations [46, 47]. Comparing selected
combinations of two simultaneous NPIs to countries without any of the two, we find
borderline-significant effects of stay at home rules plus international travel restrictions
for s short time window (see Figure S23), while the remaining results do not extend earlier insights on single NPIs. Fifth, even with the GSC method we could not fully level
out selective pre-treatment trends of the treated countries for all NPIs. There remains
some selectivity into treatment for the closure of schools, and public transport. This
selectivity is reduced when inspecting less stringent implementation of NPIs (Figure
S18) or restricting the analysis to early adopters (Figure S21), but this obviously bears
different problems of selectivity.
Altogether, the present study enhances the literature on the effectivity of NPIs with
respect to the time frame, the number of countries, and the analytical approach. However, some limitations associated with data quality and availability as well as the analytical strategy remain to be addressed by future research. Hence, we do not conclude
that our non-significant findings ultimately imply that there is indeed no treatment effects of NPIs on COVID-19 fatalities. For instance, whether one interprets the changing
trends 30 days after implementation as tentative evidence for a mitigating effect depends
on assumptions about counterfactual trajectories – which we cannot model accurately
because of selectivity into treatment and subsequent path-dependencies.
The results of our study may provide further guidance to judge the proportionality
of NPIs based on empirical efficacy using up-to-date information, and a relevant public health-indicator: disease-related mortality. Generally, a further shift in focus from
COVID-19 infections to fatalities is important for future research given the relatively low
infection-fatality rate of COVID-19 for many sub-groups of the population [48], and the
rapidly growing vaccination rates [29]. Especially in light of the severe negative externalities on economy, society and public health [3–8], further implementation of stringent
NPIs should to be grounded on evidence-based cost-benefit analyses [9].

Figure S20: The effect of NPIs on COVID-19 deaths based on data until August 31,
2020. Generalized synthetic control estimator based on daily data. Black solid lines
represent the average treatment effects on the treated (ATTs). Ribbons represent 95%
non-parametric confidence intervals based on 1,000 bootstrap runs (not clustered because of low N clusters). Dotted lines are the null lines. Dashed lines represent linear
predictions based on the 35 days before the intervention. Controls: 9 remaining NPIs as
stringency index, temperature, temperature2 , cloud cover, precipitation, humidity, total
vaccinations, 7-day backwards rolling average of NPI-residualized COVID-19 cases at
t − 7, t − 14, t − 21, t − 28, and t − 35.
