ABSTRACT
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the psychological wellbeing of populations worldwide. In this
study, we assess changes in mental health during the early months of the pandemic in Canada
and examine its relationship with another prominent problem during this time, economic
concerns.
Methods
Analyses were based on two nationally representative cross-sectional surveys from the
Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (N=4,627 in March and 4,600 in May). We described the
changes in mental health and economic concerns between March and May, and assessed the
relationship between the two characteristics.
Results
Mental health declined significantly during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic: the
proportion of Canadian adults who reported only good/fair/poor mental health grew from 46% to
52% from March to May. Economic concerns including food insecurity were an important
correlate of ‘bad’ mental health, as was younger age, female gender, and Canada-born status.
Contrary to expectations, however, economic concerns lessened during this time frame.
Conclusions
These findings suggest that policies to mitigate economic stress, such as Canada’s Emergency
Response Benefit, may have eased mental health deterioration in early pandemic months
through a reduction in financial hardship. Interventions to increase the economic security of the
population will have far-reaching consequences in terms of improved mental health, and should
be continued throughout the pandemic.

This study aims to describe how mental health changed during the early phase of the COVID-19
pandemic among Canadian adults, and to assess how economic concerns contributed to overall
mental health levels and trends.
Major public health crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic, generate feelings of insecurity, fear,
uncertainty, and emotional isolation that can translate into higher levels of psychological distress
(Pfefferbaum & North, 2020). Indeed, emergent studies from the United States (US), United
Kingdom (UK), China, and other countries documented the high overall levels of depression,
anxiety, and distress in their populations (Rajkumar, 2020; Salari et al., 2020; Serafini et al.,
2020; Xiong et al., 2020)—levels that are significantly higher than before the pandemic, as
studies from the UK (Daly et al., 2020; Pierce et al., 2020) and Canada showed (Findlay & Arim,
2020).
However, it is less clear how mental health has changed over the course of the pandemic. This
is an important question because governments need to track changes in the wellbeing of their
populations in order to assess needs and target interventions appropriately. Unfortunately, the
findings are scarce and contradictory. For instance, a UK study described a “pronounced and
prolonged” deterioration of mental health from April to June 2020 (Kwong et al., 2020). In
contrast, no significant changes in anxiety and depression levels were apparent in a sample of
Chinese adults from February to March, 2020 (Wang et al., 2020). Thus, there’s urgent need to
document changes in mental health as the pandemic develops.
The economic impact of the pandemic is of particular concern to national economies and
individuals alike, as financial hardship is a strong predictor of mental health problems (Holmes
et al., 2020). At a population level, major economic crises in general are tied to more mental
health problems and even increased suicide rates (Uutela, 2010). Moreover, a recent US study
found that job insecurity and financial concerns due to COVID-19 are linked to elevated

depression and anxiety among US adults (Wilson et al., 2020). However, little is known about
the pandemic’s impact on mental health in most countries, including Canada.
Canada is an important case because of its close ties with the United States, shared English
language, and integrated economies, as well as important political, public-health, and healthcare differences. During the first wave of the pandemic, Canada’s infection rates were roughly
average among high-income countries –much lower than the US or France, but higher than
Denmark or Japan (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2020). In terms of
economic welfare, Canada is also middle-of-the-road, providing a better social safety net than
the US but much less than social democratic welfare states in Europe. Yet no prior research
exists on mental health trends during the pandemic and the role of economic concerns on
mental health among Canadian citizens. How did Canadian adults adjust to the restrictions of
the early COVID months? Did they acclimate to, and rebound from, the initial uncertainties, or
has there been a continued deterioration of psychological health and well-being? The answers
to these questions are vital for monitoring how the population is enduring the pandemic
hardships, and represent critical pieces of information for economic, health, and social policies
that must be enacted to steer countries successfully through the pandemic.
There is an urgent need to quantify the impact of the pandemic on mental health and identify the
risk factors that heighten mental health vulnerabilities of individuals and groups in order to target
health and economic interventions effectively and support groups that need it the most. This
need is particularly acute now in the fall of 2020, as Canada, the US, and many other countries
wrestle with the second wave of the pandemic.

METHOD
Data
Analyses are based on two cross-sectional surveys administered by Statistics Canada (2020a)
as a part of the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (CPSS). The purpose of these surveys is
to collect information about the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The
first survey, The Canadian Perspective Survey Series 1: Impacts of COVID-19 (CPSS1COVID), was administered between March 29th and April 3rd, 2020. The second survey, CPSS2:
Monitoring the Effects of COVID-19, was administered between May 4 and May 10, 2020. We
refer to these surveys as Wave 1 and Wave 2. Both had a sampling frame of respondents aged
15 and older from all ten provinces; institutionalized adults and residents of the Yukon, Nunavut,
and Northwest Territories were excluded. The data were collected online and sampling weights
were calculated to be representative of the Canadian population. The sample sizes were 4,627
respondents in Wave 1 and 4,600 in Wave 2. The data are available to Canadian researchers
via Statistics Canada’s Data Liberation Initiative and to international researchers by request at
dli-idd@statcan.gc.ca from Statistics Canada. The data are de-identified; as such, they are
classified as “no human subjects” and exempt from ethics review.
Variables
Most variables were collected identically in Wave 1 and Wave 2, while some were only available
in Wave 2 (see below). The dependent variables are self-rated mental health (SRMH) and
anxiety; the main independent variables captured economic concerns; sociodemographic
characteristics were included as controls.
Variables collected identically in both surveys. The SRMH item asked respondents to assess
their mental health as “excellent,” “very good,” “good,” “fair,” or “poor.” We dichotomized SRMH

in the main analyses as excellent and very good versus good, fair, and poor (see below for
information about sensitivity analyses with alternative specifications for this and other variables).
For economic concerns, respondents were asked two questions: about their employment
security and about the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. First, they were asked to
indicate to what extent they agree or disagree with the statement, “I might lose my main job or
main self-employment income sources in the next four weeks.” We combined “agree” and
“strongly agree” as “fearing job loss;” “neither agree nor disagree” was merged with “disagree”
and “strongly disagree” as “not fearing job loss” (reference). Respondents not in the labor force
were included in a third category, as they were not asked this item. Second, respondents were
asked about the “impact of COVID-19 on [their] ability to meet financial obligations or essential
needs, such as rent or mortgage payments, utilities, and groceries.” Respondents could choose
to indicate “major impact,” “moderate impact,” “minor impact,” “no impact” (reference), or “too
soon to tell.” For parsimony, we combined minor, moderate, and major impact in the main
analyses.
Demographics comprise age (in 10-year groups from 25-34 to 75+), gender (male as
reference), immigrant status (foreign-born versus Canadian-born as reference), marital status
(married/common-law as reference versus previously married, and never married), and the
presence of children at home (no children under 18 reside in the respondent’s household as
reference versus at least one child at home). We also control for the type of dwelling (detached
house as reference, versus apartment in low-rise, apartment in high-rise, and other) as a noisy
measure of rural/urban residence, an important characteristic that was not collected in Wave 1.
Socioeconomic status is captured with educational attainment (less than high school as
reference, high school diploma, trades certificate, college diploma, university diploma or
certificate below the bachelor’s level, bachelor’s degree, and an advanced degree; included in
the models as a continuous variable).

Variables collected only in Wave 2. Three additional variables of interest were collected in Wave
2 in May. Respondents completed the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, a widelyused screening instrument for anxiety levels in the general population (Spitzer et al., 2006). The
scores range from 0 to 21, with higher values indicating higher levels of anxiety. We
dichotomized the scores using the widely-accepted threshold of 10 or above to capture
elevated, moderate-to-severe, anxiety (Löwe et al., 2008), versus scores below 10 as reference.
Wave 2 also included a dichotomous urban – rural indicator (urban as reference). Lastly, food
security information was assessed as “food secure” versus “marginally,” “moderately,” or
“severely” food insecure; we combine the three ‘insecure’ levels in analyses for parsimony.
Approach
We first described the distribution of the dependent variables and key predictors (economic
concerns) in both waves and tested for differences between the waves (Table 1, Figure 1,
Supplemental Table 1). We also estimated descriptives and comparisons between waves for all
control variables (Supplemental Table 2). Next, we estimated models of dichotomized SRMH,
using logistic regression on the pooled -- Wave 1 and Wave 2 -- sample with an indicator for
Wave 2 (Table 2). The purpose of this step, which is the best approach for the repeated crosssectional data structure, was to estimate the change in the odds of ‘bad’ mental health between
March and May, as well as the association between all covariates and the odds of reporting
‘bad’ mental health at either Wave. We also checked whether the effect of covariates on mental
health changed between March and May by including interactions between covariates and the
Wave 2 indicator (Supplemental Table 3; no interaction was statistically significant, indicating
that the effects did not change between March and May).
In the second part of the analysis, we focused on only the May data from Wave 2. We estimated
logistic regression models of SRMH and anxiety as a function of socio-demographic and
economic covariates (Table 3, Supplemental Table 4). The purpose of this step was to assess

the relationship between economic concerns and mental health in more detail because Wave 2
included three important variables not assessed in Wave 1: anxiety, food insecurity, and rural
residence. Further, we also visualized the effects of economic concerns on mental health
(Figure 2). Using the findings from the models summarized in Table 3, we calculated the
counterfactual adjusted predicted probabilities of ‘bad’ mental health and elevated anxiety that
would be expected if all respondents had a given level of economic concerns but otherwise kept
their actual sociodemographic characteristics (Williams, 2012). Finally, we calculated the
probabilities of ‘bad’ mental health in May under another counterfactual assumption: what it
would have been if the levels of economic concerns remained at March levels (summarized in
the Results section).
All analyses used sampling weights. Missingness in the data was low; it ranged from 0% for
most variables, to 3.6% of total cases. We conducted multiple-imputation via chained equations
with 10 imputed datasets (Royston & White, 2011) for regression models to ensure equal
sample sizes across the nested models (findings were nearly identical to complete-case
analysis). We conducted extensive sensitivity analyses to check the robustness of the findings
to alternative variable and model specifications; they are summarized in the online supplement,
together with the supplemental tables.
RESULTS
Figure 1 shows the weighted distributions of SRMH and economic concerns in both March and
May. As the pandemic unfolded in the spring of 2020, there was a decline in psychological
wellbeing, as measured with the SRMH. While 46.0% of the population rated their health as only
poor/fair/good in March, 52.3% did so by May, a 6.3 percentage point increase (Table 1). That
is, less than half the population rated their health as excellent or very good by May. Contrary to
our expectations, employment security and financial concerns became less acute in May
compared to March. The share of securely employed people (who did not expect to lose their

jobs) increased from 37.7% to 46.8%, and the percentage of those who expected to lose their
jobs halved from 19.8% to 9.0% (Table 1). The share who said that COVID-19 had no
(negative) impact on their ability to meet financial obligations increased from 31.5% to 42.8%,
while the share who experienced a “major” impact decreased from 13.6% to 9.2%
(Supplemental Table 1). The most considerable shift was in the share who felt it was “too early
to tell,” which declined from 23.8% to 10.9%. Supplemental Table 1 also shows a detailed
distribution of food insecurity, which was assessed only in Wave 2 in May: 14.6% of Canadians
experienced some degree of food insecurity, from marginal (5.8%), moderate (6.8%), to severe
(2.0%).
Supplemental Table 2 displays the distribution of all sociodemographic characteristics and
compares them between Waves 1 and 2. The comparison is important because it serves as an
assurance that the two waves are equivalent in their representativeness. The assumption is that
basic socio-demographic characteristics should not change over five weeks. And indeed, the
distributions of all characteristics from age, gender, immigrant status, to educational attainment,
are statistically equal in both Waves.
Table 2 summarizes findings from logistic regression models that test for change in mental
health between March and May. The mental health of Canadians worsened during this time.
Specifically, the odds of reporting good/fair/poor mental health, as opposed to excellent or very
good health, increased by about 30% in the population on average (OR=1.29, 95% CI 1.12,1.49
in unadjusted Model 1 and OR=1.32, 95% CI 1.13,1.53 in demographics-adjusted Model 2).
Adjusting for demographics does not meaningfully impact the mental health change because
the characteristics, as shown in Supplemental Table 3, did not change between the two Waves.
Models 3 and 4 further control for economic concerns. Employment security was significantly
associated with ‘bad’ mental health (Model 3). However, its effects became non-significant net
of financial impact (Model 4), which, in itself, was associated with significantly higher odds of

‘bad’ mental health, compared with excellent or very good rating (OR=2.02, 95% CI 1.62,2.53
among those impacted by the pandemic and OR=1.66, 95% CI 1.39,1.98 among those who
said it was ‘too soon to tell,’ compared with respondents who were not negatively impacted by
the pandemic). Net of changes in the economic concerns, the odds of ‘bad’ mental health
increased by 46% from March to May (OR=1.46, 95% CI 1.25,1.71 in Model 4).
Table 3 shows the associations of all covariates with the two mental-health measures in May.
Younger, female, Canada-born, and previously married adults were more likely to report ‘bad’
SRMH, compared with older, male, immigrant, and currently married adults (Model 1). Rural
residence, household size, the presence of children, education, and employment security were
not correlated with SRMH net of other covariates. However, the financial impact of COVID-19
and food insecurity were associated with ‘worse’ mental health. Adults who said the financial
impact was still uncertain (“too soon to tell”) had 44% higher odds of reporting ‘bad’ mental
health and those who were already impacted had 77% higher odds, compared to respondents
who experienced no impact. Further, adults in food-insecure households had 79% higher odds
of reporting ‘bad’ mental health, compared with adults in food-secure households.
The patterns for elevated anxiety were similar across many, but not all, covariates. Younger,
female, and previously married respondents had higher odds of elevated anxiety, compared
with older, male, married Canadians. Unlike for SRMH, immigrant status was not a salient
covariate, but rural residency was associated with nearly half the odds of elevated anxiety.
Among economic covariates, respondents who felt they were likely to lose their jobs had nearly
twice the odds of elevated anxiety (unlike the zero effect for SRMH). Financial impact and food
insecurity had a substantial effect on elevated anxiety: adults who experienced an economic
impact from COVID-19, or were still uncertain had nearly twice the odds of elevated anxiety;
food-insecure adults had nearly triple the odds of elevated anxiety, compared with food-secure
adults. Supplemental Table 4 shows results for detailed categories of financial impact and food

insecurity. The table shows roughly a dose-response pattern in both variables: the more severe
financial impact or food insecurity, the larger the detrimental effect on psychological well-being.
Figure 2 visualizes the results from Table 4, using adjusted predicted probabilities of both
outcomes. The results highlight the large differences by all economic-concerns variables. In
May 2020, if all Canadians felt a major financial impact of the pandemic, about 60% of the
population would report ‘bad’ mental health, as compared to roughly 47% if all Canadians felt no
impact. For anxiety, employment security was a crucial indicator: while only about 15% of
Canadians would have elevated anxiety if they were securely employed, some 33% would if
they were expecting to lose their jobs. Finally, food insecurity had a major effect on both
outcomes: it was associated with about 15 percentage points higher probability of reporting
‘bad’ mental health and more than double the probability of elevated anxiety (about 15% in foodsecure versus 36% in insecure groups).
Finally, we calculated what the probability of ‘bad’ mental health would have been in May, if
economic concerns did not lessen from their March levels. If these concerns remained at their
high March levels, the proportion of Canadians reporting ‘bad’ mental health would be 54.3%, or
2 percentage points higher than the observed 52.3%. The proportion with elevated anxiety
would be 19.3%, or 1.2 percentage points higher than the actual 18.1%.
DISCUSSION
The aims of this study were twofold. First, we assessed changes in mental health and economic
concerns among Canadian adults from March to May 2020 during the first few months of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Second, we examined how the economic concerns, as well as other
variables, were associated with ‘bad’ mental health and elevated anxiety.
Nationally representative data showed a high level of mental health difficulties, which increased
over the five-week period from March to May. Already by March, 46% of Canadian adults rated

their health as only good, fair, or poor, as compared to very good or excellent. This is
substantially worse than before the pandemic (Findlay & Arim, 2020); moreover, further
deterioration occurred by May when over 52% of the population reported ‘bad’ mental health.
While few studies examined changes in mental health during COVID-19, our findings echo
those from the UK, which also described continued deterioration of mental health (Kwong et al.,
2020). While we did not have data on anxiety from March, the overall level of anxiety in May in
the population was high: 18% of Canadians reported moderate to severe levels of anxiety. To
put this in context, this is three times the prevalence in general populations who were not
suffering with the stress of a pandemic (Hinz et al., 2017; Löwe et al., 2008) and much closer to
the 20% prevalence found in local residents six months after they lived through the devastating
Fort McMurray wildfire, which was the costliest natural disaster and largest evacuation in
Canadian history, destroying the town and surrounding area (Agyapong et al., 2018).
Economic anxiety is a close correlate of distress (Mann et al., 2020), and at the forefront of
concerns during the pandemic. We expected that job-security concerns and worries about the
financial impact of the pandemic would increase between March and May. Unexpectedly, we
found the opposite: a statistically significant decrease in both fears about job security and in the
impact of COVID-19 on the ability to meet financial obligations. With the current data, we cannot
assess the reasons behind the changes. Perhaps it is a combination of heightened fears at the
beginning of the pandemic, coupled with amelioration of the actual situation as a result of
economic policies that supported the most vulnerable groups, such as the Canadian Emergency
Response Benefit (CERB), better information as the pandemic unfolded, or people ‘adjusted’ to
the new reality and their fears about job losses and their inability to meet financial obligations
subsided slightly. Given the importance and unexpected nature of this finding, we urge Statistics
Canada to include these items and other measures of economic security in subsequent waves

of the CPSS collection. The agency should also include measures of mental health in its
ongoing and future economic-focused surveys to probe the associations in further detail.
The lessened economic concerns are important for mental health because of the powerful
correlation between the two. Both ‘bad’ general mental health and anxiety were significantly
higher for people who were anticipating that they may lose their jobs, or who experienced a
financial impact of the pandemic on their ability to meet financial obligations. We calculated that
if the economic concerns had not decreased as they did between March and May, the observed
prevalence of health problems would have been even higher: 2 percentage points higher for
poor/fair/good SRMH and 1.2 percentage points higher for moderate/severe anxiety.
Food insecurity is also a salient correlate of poor mental health and anxiety in our analysis.
However, food insecurity was not assessed in Wave 1; therefore, we do not know how this
predictor has changed since the beginning of the pandemic. In 2017/18, 10.5% of Canadian
adults were food insecure, in contrast to the May prevalence of 14.6% (Statistics Canada,
2020c). This is an almost 40% increase from the prior value, a worrisome finding for multiple
reasons, including mental health: food insecurity increased the likelihood of poor mental health
by 80% and nearly tripled the odds of elevated anxiety.
Several caveats limit the utility of our findings. The data are repeated cross-section and thus did
not allow us to examine how changes in economic concerns predicted changes in mental health
within individuals for a more causal interpretation. We also did not have access to several
important covariates, such as the province of residence, race/ethnicity, or household income,
which may influence mental health, or access to mental health services (Scharf & Oinonen,
2020). Moreover, it would have been useful to understand the causes of the lessened economic
concerns between March and May, especially to what degree government policies contributed.
The May CPSS survey was in the field during the peak of the first wave of the pandemic
(Statistics Canada, 2020b). As the pandemic unfolds through 2020 and beyond, it is critical to

continue collecting information on psychological well-being. It is also worth exploring how
changing policies such as relaxing of restrictions on social interaction influence mental health.
Finally, it is essential to continue gathering data about the impacts in different provinces and for
vulnerable populations, such as racialized minorities or First Nations communities. Research
during the early stages of the pandemic in Canada found large disparities across geography
and race/ethnicity in COVID-19 infection and mortality rates (Choi et al., 2020; Denice et al.,
2020). These are vital questions that are important to answer and need to be continually asked,
not only as the pandemic unfolds, but as an ongoing program of research. We hope Statistics
Canada continues to collect additional data on the intersections of mental health, economic
well-being, and socio-demographic characteristics to address these questions, not only in new
waves the CPSS, but also in its other initiatives.
Good mental health is important under all circumstances, but perhaps particularly for enduring
and rebuilding after COVID-19, the largest pandemic in a century. We found that mental health
declined even as economic security improved. We therefore need to understand the impact on
mental health not only of economic stressors, but also other potential drivers, including social
isolation due to lockdown and working from home, stresses on parents and other caregivers,
and additional hardships imposed by the pandemic (Holmes et al., 2020). Our study showed the
continued wear-and-tear that COVID-19 is having on Canadians’ psychological health, as well
as positive developments of lessened economic distress, at least for the dimensions measured
in the study and for the specific times when the surveys were administered. Policies that
buttress Canadian’s economic wellbeing not only impact their spending and employment but
also their mental as well as physical health. It is, therefore, extremely important that Federal and
Provincial governments maintain their economic relief support programs.

Results from weighted, multiply imputed logistic models of dichotomized SRMH (good/fair/poor versus excellent or very good) and
elevated anxiety (score of 10 or above on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder GAD-7 scale) estimated using the Wave 2 sample. Odds
ratios and 95% confidence intervals are shown. N=4,600.

Figure 1. Distribution of SRMH and economic concerns in Waves 1 and 2.

Note: weighted proportions. Supplemental Table 1 shows the percentages and statistical tests
comparing the distributions of each variable between the two surveys. The differences in all three
variables are statistically significant (p<.001). N=4,627 in the March survey and 4,600 in May.

SUPPLEMENT
Sensitivity analyses. We conducted extensive sensitivity checks to assess the robustness of the
findings to different model and variable specifications. 1) We estimated the SRMH models using
the original 5-point measure using OLS and ordered logistic models, and as a dichotomized
measure with a different threshold (excellent, very good, and good, versus fair or poor). 2) We
estimated the full 0-21 point anxiety score using OLS, Poisson, and negative binomial
regression models. 3) We examined working-age adults (aged 25-64) separately as a group
potentially most sensitive to employment and economic concerns. 4) We excluded dwelling type
from regression models of change in SRMH. 5) We included education as a series of 6 dummy
variables to test for possible threshold effects. 6) We included employment information that
distinguished adults who were temporarily absent from work due to COVID-19 or for other
reasons from those currently employed; we found that these groups did not differ for either
mental health outcome. 7) We measured financial impact (minor, moderate, and severe) and
food insecurity (marginal, moderate, and severe) as categorical variables, and found a doseresponse relationship. A higher level of impact and insecurity was associated with increasingly
worse mental health; these results are included in Supplemental Table 3 below. 8) We
conducted complete-case analyses parallel to those shown in Tables 2 and 3, which are
multiply imputed. 9) We included a yes/no variable where respondents were asked whether they
applied for the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) benefit. This variable is only
available in the May wave, as the benefit became available on March 25th. On its own, applying
for the CERB benefit was associated with worse mental health, but it was not statistically
significant when we included the economic concerns. This makes sense in that applying for
CERB is an indicator of financial vulnerability but receiving CERB then lessens financial
concerns. 10) We examined men and women separately because of the substantial gender
disparity in mental health in the general population (Rosenﬁeld & Mouzon, 2013). There were
gender differences in prevalence of both mental health measures and some demographic
covariates but not for economic concerns. 11) We checked for collinearity in the predictors,
finding no concerns. All variance inflation factors for individual variables were below 2. The
results from all sensitivity checks were substantively the same as those shown in the paper,
corroborating the robustness of our reported results.
