"4" "Abstract:"
"5" "As humans are spreading throughout the world, infectious diseases have been a constant companion such as Bubonic Plague (200 Million deaths), 17th Century Great Plague (3 Million deaths), Plague of Justinian (30-50 Million deaths), etc . Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) which was published on 11th January 2020 showing the intensity of Global research and development activity to develop a drug/vaccine against the disease. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Human to human transmission has created a pandemic situation across the world. Pharmaceutical companies play a crucial role in this scenario to provide Drugs/Vaccines/Therapies to treat and tackle the novel coronavirus disease of 2019. This paper consists of the Drugs and Vaccines which are developed, or in the process of development , their current stage of development (clinical trials) with their patent review."
"6" "Introduction"
"7" "Coronavirus was discovered in  the  early  1960s . The name of the virus comes from the crown - like spikes it has on its surface while the world “Corona” is derived from a Latin word “crown”. Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from a common cold to more severe diseases. Novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously ascertained in humans."
"8" "Coronavirus is one of the common viruses that can cause infection in your sinuses, nose ,  or upper throat. Most of the coronaviruses are not dangerous and are present with mild symptoms and are treated easily symptomatically, but it killed 858 people in MERS in 2015 and this was a result of a severe presentation causing respiratory failure ."
"9" "To be more precise, Coronavirus comes under the family of Orthocoronavirinae and is surrounded by envelope like frame which gives a sense of the single - stranded RNA genome.  The shape of their nucleocapsid is helical and the size of coronavirus ranges from 26-32 kilobases which  are  deemed to be the largest category for  an  RNA virus ."
"10" "Why is it difficult to produce a vaccine against coronaviruses?"
"11" "Protective immunity against a respiratory disease like infectious bronchitis (IB) in poultry or COVID-19 in humans requires a strong local immune response ."
"12" "In poultry ,  it is taken care of by using live attenuated vaccines but live coronavirus vaccines are difficult to produce as attenuation often renders them unable to produce a str o ng immune system’s response . Over attenuation can lead the vaccine safe but not immunogenic and therefore attenuation can create a vaccine capable of inducing a strong immune response but may cause vaccine reactions."
"13" "Although,  Coronavirus infections can be treated, prevented and an outbreak can be stopped through active engagement of healthcare professionals, decision - makers, media, workers, police which was demonstrated by these people in the year s  2003 and 2012 for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively . This document aims at providing  an analysis of  Drugs/Vaccines/Therapies developed, developing ,  or under clinical trials  to prevent the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak."

"15" "Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine                  Description:  Antimalarial Agent                                                                                                                                               Lead  Developer:   Sanofi"
"16" "Chloroquine(CQ) was first  developed in the 1940s  with the approval of  the  U.S Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for malaria. After the outbreak of the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) the scientists raised the possibility that Chlor o quine and its derivative hydro xychloro quine may be effective in treating COVID-19."
"17" "The antimalarials hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have demonstrated antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV2) in small, uncontrolled clinical trials. CQ and HCQ are well known to ophthalmologists because of retinal toxicity after long term usage for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other rheumatoid diseases."
"18" "Chloroquine phosphate is being produced in Nantong City, China where the experts have also affirmed that it can be used for treating pneumonia which is caused by the Novel Coronavirus. On 19 th  March 2020 ,  the US President Donald Trump had declared that chloroquine (Hydroxychloroquine/Plaquenil),  which is a drug generally used to treat diseases like arthritis and malaria to be tested as a treatment for deadly virus COVID-19 as it was also approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Although FDA has issued an emergency use of authorization for Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Chloroquine ."
"19" "Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) can effectively treat disease manifestations such as joint pain and rashes; reducing thrombotic events; prolong survival. Although HCQ is a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, which is effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV2 infection in vitro. Moreover, HCQ is safer than chloroquine (CQ) and  a  successful anti-inflammatory agent that has been used extensively in autoimmune diseases and can significantly decrease the production of cytokines and in particular pro-inflammatory response ."

"21" "Chemical Formula for Hydroxychloroquine:  C 18 H 26 ClN 3 O"
"22" "How is it working? What is the vaccine targeting?"
"23" "Chloroquine  interferes with the virus’s ability to replicate in two ways: -"
"24" "The drug enters compartments called endosomes within the cell membrane which  tends  to be acidic as the virus releases acidify endosomes to breach the cell membrane and began replication."
"25" "When  the  virus inserts its  spike protein  into the enzyme 2 receptor, it sets off the chemical process that alters the structure of the receptor and allows the virus to infect."
"26" "How is it working? What is the vaccine targeting?"
"27" "Hydroxychloroquine"
"28" "It includes inhibition of viral enzymes or processes such as viral DNA and RNA polymerase, viral protein glycosylation, virus assembly, new virus particle transport ,  and release ."
"29" "It also involves ACE2 cellular receptor inhibition, acidification at the surface of the cell membrane inhibiting fusion of virus ,  and immunomodulation of cytokine release ."
