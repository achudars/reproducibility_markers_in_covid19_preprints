Abstract

Why are COVID-19 conspiracy theories so prevalent? Particularly, why would some citizens ignore
scientific evidence and common logic but, instead, be convinced that COVID-19 was a military
experiment or spread by 5G signals? Why would they believe that Bill Gates had anything to do with
it? In this contribution, we argue that populism is at the centre of these beliefs, as the complex nature
of the COVID-19 pandemic makes it an ideal playground for populists’ opposition to scientific and
political elites. We use Structural Equation Models and panel survey data (n = 823) from the Austrian
Corona Panel Project to test this argument. We demonstrate a negative correlation of populist attitudes
with both trust in political and scientific institutions, which, in return, negatively relate to COVID-19
conspiracy beliefs. This results in an overall positive relationship of populist attitudes and conspiracy
beliefs, above and beyond political ideology. These findings have important implications for elite
communication regarding virus mitigation.

Introduction
As early as in February 2020, the WHO lamented about having to fight not only the
consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic but also those of an “infodemic” in connection to
misinformation and conspiracy theories related to the virus (Boberg et al., 2020; Zarocostas,
2020). Arguably right-wing populist leaders worldwide have contributed their fair share to the
spread of said “infodemic” by openly disagreeing with scientific experts, public administrators
and other political leaders on how to respond to the crisis (Evans and Hargittai, 2020).
Furthermore, populist leaders have used a vocabulary of “medical populism”, ranging from a
simplification of the pandemic to the forging of divisions in times of crisis, as well as to being
the source of misinformation and openly supporting conspiracy theories (Lasco, 2020). While
Donald Trump, for example, regularly alluded to a “deep state” conspiracy in connection to
COVID-191, a politician of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) claimed in a regional parliament
that the virus could be a US-American bioweapon.2
A considerable number of citizens around the globe have since taken to the streets to
protest COVID-19 containment measures, which they believe to be unnecessary. 3 Beyond
showing open support for far-right ideologies and criticising the supposedly anti-democratic
preventive measures against the coronavirus, many also scant conspiracy theories; a.o., that
COVID-19 isn’t worse than the flu or that it is spread by 5G radio waves (Ahmed et al., 2020).
But is there also a connection between populism and citizens’ beliefs about the pandemic?

We argue that – beyond and in addition to the widely discussed link between (far-right)
ideology and conspiracy belief (see, e.g. van Prooijen et al., 2015; Freeman et al., 2020; Sutton
and Douglas, 2020) – it is citizens’ populist world-view that fosters conspiracy belief (Castanho
Silva et al., 2017; Bergmann, 2018; Oliver and Rahn, 2016; van Prooijen, 2018). In particular,
we aim to expand previous work by studying the underlying link between citizens’ populist
attitudes and their conspiracy belief in the realm of COVID-19. While we do so, we make sure
not to conflate populism and ideology, and we explicitly focus on causal mechanisms that
should be independent of ideology but entirely a function of populist attitudes, namely the role
of trust in political institutions and trust in science. Thus, we specifically pose that populists a)
have lower trust in political institutions that implement evidence-based COVID-19 policy
measures (i.e., government and parliament) and b) lack trust in science more generally, which
makes them particularly prone to anti-science COVID-19 conspiracy theories. Structural
Equation Models and data from the Austrian Corona Panel Project are consistent with our
theoretical argument.

Populism, Trust, and Conspiracy Theories
The ideational core of populism (Hawkins and Rovira Kaltwasser, 2018) proclaims three
distinct features that explain why citizens may fall for conspiracies: they oppose political and
societal elites (anti-elitism), whom they blame for betraying the upright and honest people
(people-centrism) in a world that is black and white with no shades of grey (Manichean
outlook). This ideational core is independent of political ideology, that is, we observe these
traits among left- and right-wing actors, be it parties or individuals (Rooduijn and Akkerman,
2017; Van Hauwaert and Van Kessel, 2018).
We assume that these core features of populism directly inform how populist citizens
relate to established political institutions such as the government or the parliament (see Mudde

3

and Rovira Kaltwasser, 2012). These institutions represent the established political order,
which populists oppose as it is regarded as a manifestation of elite power betraying common
citizens rather than serving them. However, these institutions play a central role in mitigating
the impact of COVID-19 as well as communicating its dangers; even if their response may
sometimes be hesitant, inconsistent, or contradictory (Deslatte, 2020).
Populists’ anti-elitist stance, however, does not only target political institutions but is
directed at scientific institutions as well (see Wirth et al., 2016). Scholars and academic experts
are seen as part of a technocratic elite (Caramani, 2017) that holds power over the questions of
“truth” and is not legitimised by the virtuous “people”, thus, being part of the plot against them
(see Mede and Schäfer, 2020). This antagonism between the populist world-view and scientific
evidence has previously been identified as the source of populists’ climate change denial
(Fraune and Knodt, 2018; Huber, 2020; Huber et al., 2020) and vaccine hesitancy (Kennedy,
2019). It becomes even more relevant in times where scientific knowledge forms the basis of
policy decisions but is not at all easy to follow as it is often characterised by uncertainty,
unpredictability, and incomplete control (Funtowicz and Ravetz, 1993).
The nature of the political response to the global pandemic almost invites populists to
oppose these measures and to rather believe in elite-conspiracies. Given the large uncertainty
and immense pressure to act, most policies responding to the virus seem elite-driven top-down
policies with lower levels of parliamentary debate. Increased media visibility of
epidemiologists, virologists and other scientific experts (Wormer, 2020) make it relatively easy
for sceptics to claim that sudden and oftentimes strict government responses to COVID-19
were a result of backroom deals between powerful elites (may they be from politics, academia,
“big pharma”, or famous philanthropists).
While throughout history people have been prone to conspiracy theories during
impactful societal crisis situations (van Prooijen and Douglas, 2017), evidence suggests that

4

populists may be particularly prone to conspiracy theories that are built on the accusation of
abuse of power by elites (Castanho Silva et al., 2017). On social media, widely posted or shared
COVID-19 conspiracy theories, such as the contents of the infamous “Plandemic” movie
(Moran, 2020), combine the criticism of political elites with that of technocratic elites. This
leads us to suspect two causal pathways of how populism and COVID-19 conspiracy belief
may relate. All-in-all, we expect an effect of populism on COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs
running through individuals’ (1) trust in political institutions and (2) trust in science and
research.

Data, Measures and Method
Our data focuses on Austria, which is a particularly interesting case to test our theory. While
previous research on conspiracy beliefs was often focussed on two-party systems such as the
US and the UK (van Prooijen and Douglas, 2018), Austria represents a good example of an
increasingly common situation in many Western parliamentary democracies, where
mainstream parties are being challenged by at least one major populist party (if not more).
To test our theoretical arguments outlined above, we use data from the Austrian Corona
Panel Study. This study surveys the Austrian voting-age population. Respondents in this panel
are selected based on the following key demographics: age, gender, gender x age, region
(province), educational level, and municipality size. The quota sample was structured to closely
represent the Austrian population (Kittel et al., 2020a, 2020b). We focus on 823 respondents
who took part in Wave 6 and Wave 9 of the study, as these waves provide the measures of
populist attitudes, trust in political institutions, trust in science as well as several items of
conspiracy belief. Wave 6 was fielded between 1 May and 6 May, while Wave 9 was fielded
between 23 May and 27 May 2020.

Dependent variable
As Sutton and Douglas (2014: 256) explain, “[t]o believe in any conspiracy theory is to believe
that authorities can be malevolent, that they can conceal their evil‐doing, and that official
explanations for major events may be lies”. To capture underlying conspiracy beliefs,
respondents were asked to what extent they considered eight statements about COVID-19 to
be true or false, with a scale ranging from 1 (very certain that this is false) to 5 (very certain
that this is true) and a middle category 3 (unsure, whether that is true or false). While for most
statements, a higher score reflects conspiracy beliefs, items C3 and C5 were phrased the
opposite way. Table 1 provides the wording, factor loadings from a confirmatory factor
analysis embedded in a structural equation environment, and the share of respondents prone to
these beliefs according to our sample. In total, a staggering 69 % of respondents were “unsure”
about at least one conspiracy theory, or were even "rather certain" or "very certain" that it was
actually correct. Almost 3 % of our respondents, furthermore, fail to reject any of the eight
conspiracy theories queried. The factor loadings generally suggest that all the items load
reasonably well on the underlying construct.

either support a conspiracy theory or are uncertain whether it is true or not. Shares in brackets are those
who are uncertain if the statement is true or not. Figure A1 in the Appendix shows the correlation between
the items.

Independent variables: Populism, trust in political institutions, trust in science and
research, and ideology
We utilise a standard scale to capture populism, namely the CSES Module 5 scale (Hobolt et
al., 2016). Based on Akkerman et al. (2014), this scale captures the aforementioned ideational
definition of populism. Questions range from attitudes towards elites to morality in politics,
thereby neatly capturing all three dimensions of populism. Empirically testing the scale,
Castanho Silva and colleagues (2019) show the scale works well and particularly captures antielitism. Populist attitudes were recorded in a previous wave (Wave 6) as compared to our
dependent variable. This allows for a clearer temporal order and thus a more causal argument
about the relationship between populists attitudes and conspiracy beliefs.
Also measured in Wave 6 are our two mediators: respondents’ trust in political
institutions, namely trust in parliament and trust in government, as well as their trust in science
and research. The scale ranges from 0 (do not trust at all) to 10 (completely trust).
7

We additionally include several control variables to isolate the effect of populism on
COVID-19 conspiracy belief.

4

Notably, we include political ideology and ideological

extremism, which we proxy with left-right self-placement and its centred and squared term.
Often, populism comes in combination with a certain ideological leaning, for example, with
anti-immigration positions (for right-wing populism) or anti-market positions (for left-wing
populists). Often, studies do not measure populist attitudes directly or conflate trust in politics,
ideological extremism, and other concepts related to populism (Akkerman et al., 2014). Thus,
being able to disentangle these two concepts is essential to understand the role of populism.

Estimation Strategy
We rely on structural equation models (SEM) to simultaneously measure latent variables and
estimate their interconnectedness through regression analyses. SEM provides several key
advantages over classic regression analyses when using latent constructs. First of all, we
capture several latent structures within one model. This would allow understanding the interconcept correlation between the concepts and potentially adjust for it. SEM equally allows to
capture and model the covariation of other, manifest or latent, variables. Second, SEM allows
us to draw and test more complex theoretical models, which allow for indirect paths, and thus
several dependent variables, which is important given our theoretical expectations. We model
the structural equation model using the R package lavaan (Rosseel, 2012). We use the ‘WLSM’
estimator, which allows for categorical variables.

4

We do not apply sample weights since our variables stem from different waves of the panel. Since
we control for central variables used to create the weights, our estimation already adjusts for slight
deviations from the population. Correcting for either weights does not affect the results presented
in this article.

Results
Figure 1 shows the bivariate distribution of populism and COVID-19 conspiracy belief,
providing first evidence of the association between the two variables (r = 0.41). Individuals
with higher levels of populist attitudes are also more likely to believe in conspiracy theories.
In the aggregate, we observe these two variables are associated. However, our paper aims at
understanding the causal mechanisms linking these two concepts in more detail. Thus, we are
interested in whether this relationship is mediated by trust in political institutions and trust in
science as well as whether it holds true irrespective of citizens’ political ideology.

Figure 1 Bivariate Distribution of Populism and Conspiracy Belief

Note: Line is a local polynomial regression line (‘loess’).

Figure 2 summarises the core findings of our argument: populism indirectly affects COVID19 conspiracy beliefs through trust in political and scientific institutions. The evidence lends
strong support for both paths. First, populist attitudes negatively correlate with trust in the
9

government and the parliament. Trust in these political institutions, in return, negatively relates
to individuals’ probability to believe in COVID-19 conspiracies. In other words, trusting
political institutions, which are central in the mitigation and communication of COVID-19
risks, decreases the probability that respondents believe in conspiracy theories, such as that 5G
is causing COVID-19. This results in a standardised total effect size of populism through
institutional trust of 0.19, which is statistically significant.
Second, higher populist attitudes relate to lower trust in science and research, which
consequently decreases COVID-19 conspiracy belief. Given the importance of science and
scientists in the communication of the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreaks as well as their
role in informing key policies, it makes sense that citizens who distrust the institution of science
and research do not trust in the phenomenon it tries to address either. Thus, an increase in
populist attitudes would result in an increase in COVID-19 conspiracy belief (the standardised
total effect size for this path is 0.10 and statistically significant).
All-in-all, this suggests that populism is an important predictor of citizens’ conspiracy
thinking in respect to the COVID-19 pandemic. The total effect of populism (that is the
combination of both paths) is statistically significant and large in size (standardised regression
coefficient is 0.29).

paths indicate that p < 0.001, n.s. indicate p > 0.05. We included age, education, gender, political ideology,
political interest, a dummy for preconditions and a dummy for respondents in Vienna. These controls are included
in all regression paths. We only show political ideology for the main outcome variable. Please consult Table A1
in the Appendix for the regression tables. We report robust goodness of fit indicators given the use of ‘WLSM.’
Goodness of fit: X²(228, n = 823) = 1103.1; p < 0.05; CFI = 0.970; RMSEA = 0.056; SRMR = 0.063.

In the introduction, we emphasised the potential role of ideology both within the supply-side
as well as within the citizen response to COVID-19. While, more generally, extreme ideology
is shown to relate to conspiracy belief (van Prooijen et al., 2015), most openly sceptical of
COVID-19 were politicians like Donald J. Trump or Jair Bolsonaro, who are typical
representatives of right-wing populism. Similarly, in Europe, the populist radical right AfD
and Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) are two standard cases that took more sceptical stances on
COVID-19 (e.g., FPÖ, 2020a). To disentangle the effects of populism and ideology, our
models thus include left-right self-placement and its squared term (measuring extremism). As
shown in Figure 2, left-right self-placement – but not its squared term – is positively associated
with COVID-19 conspiracy belief. In addition to that, throughout the model, the standardised
regression coefficients of ideology are substantially smaller than those of populism.

11

Robustness Checks
To assess the robustness of these findings, we conduct a series of additional tests. First, we
exclude voters of the populist radical right FPÖ, which tapped into conspiracy theories, like
forced vaccinations (FPÖ, 2020b).
Second, we recode all conspiracy theories into dummies that capture whether somebody
rejects the conspiracy theory or not. While the ordinal five-point scale provides more
information, one could argue that it also induces measurement error. On the one hand, we
substitute the ordinal variables with dichotomised variables in the confirmatory factor analysis.
On the other hand, we created an additive index which captures the number of conspiracy
theories an individual does not reject.
Finally, we include a direct path linking populism and COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs to
understand whether the two mechanisms we propose are the only paths through which
populism relates to the outcome.
All tests confirm the robustness of our findings (see Table A2, A3, A4 and A5 in the
Appendix). Our findings do not change when excluding FPÖ voters or when recoding the
variables. The direct path of populist attitudes returns a positive but insignificant coefficient.
This indicates that our two proposed mechanisms capture the core relationship of populism and
COVID-19 conspiracy theories, above and beyond political ideology.

Conclusion & Discussion
Among others, results have shown that 69 % of respondents fail to reject all of the eight
conspiracy theories surveyed in this study. Even if these eight theories are largely “harmless”,
this finding is insofar problematic as previous research suggests that belief in one conspiracy
may soon lead to belief in other conspiracies (Lewandowsky et al., 2013). Not clearly rejecting
the COVID-19 conspiracies above may thus make the slope to more dangerous ones (e.g.,

12

‘QAnon’) significantly more slippery.
Our main argument relates to the relationship between respondents’ populist attitudes
and their COVID-19 conspiracy belief. In fact, we identify two causal paths: Populist attitudes
decrease trust in political institutions (1) as well as trust in science and research (2), both
negatively relate to COVID-19 conspiracy belief. While right-wing populist actors, in
particular, seem to be actively contributing to the COVID-19 conspiracy theory supply as well
as its spread, our individual level evidence suggests that right-wing ideology plays only a
subordinate role to populist attitudes (see, also Oliver and Wood, 2014).
The findings have several important implications. First, citizens do not necessarily
follow party elites in their conspiracy beliefs. On a supply level, the FPÖ in Austria is by far
the most sceptical party regarding COVID-19. However, we observe that populist attitudes,
which appear across the left-right spectrum, are more important in predicting these COVID-19
attitudes. This has substantial implications for our response to this scepticism, as these
conspiracy beliefs are not restricted to fringe ideologies. Second, while it might appear that
right-wing populist governments have particularly struggled with fighting the pandemic, our
results suggest that claiming that “coronavirus could kill off populism”5 might be too shortsighted. As acceptance of COVID-19 mitigation measures is also declining in countries led by
non-populist governments (Kittel et al., 2020b), and as (right-wing) populist leaders have
monopolised on discontent with COVID-19 policies and related conspiracy belief, there is
reason to believe that support for populist challengers in these countries could even increase in
the course of 2020 and beyond. Third, the results highlight that effective communication about
COVID-19 may not only try to correct existing misperceptions (Lyons et al., 2019) but to break
the mechanism that leads to these misperceptions. That is, communicative efforts should not

13

let political and scientific institutions appear as a detached elite. Instead, politicians and
scientists might rather engage in an open and transparent conversation with the public,
acknowledging lay peoples’ needs and concerns, in order to make complex information
accessible and to avoid information gaps that can be easily filled with various forms of
misinformation (Brennen et al., 2020).
Overall, our study advances the understanding of causal mechanisms that lead the way
from populism to the ‘Plandemic’. Since populist attitudes might not be the only or even
strongest predictor of COVID-19 conspiracy belief, probing other known relationships in this
regard will be an important avenue for future research to further inform adequate policy
responses and communication strategies in unprecedented crisis situations such as the
emergence of the novel coronavirus.
