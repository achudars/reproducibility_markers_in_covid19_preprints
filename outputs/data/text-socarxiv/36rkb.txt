Abstract
The paper analyses the travel intentions of tourists in the post-pandemic world. The sample
includes 974 respondents from Bulgaria. The findings show that most of the respondents are
ready to travel within two months after travel is allowed in the country. For their first trip,
respondents will travel in the country, by their car and with their family. Hygiene, disinfection
and reliable health system in a destination will be the leading factors in travellers’ decisions,
according to the findings. Women and older respondents have higher health and safety
preferences than do men and younger respondents.

Introduction
At the beginning of 2020, the world evidenced an unprecedented situation caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic. Although there were other similar epidemics such as Ebola, SARS, MERS
in the previous decades (Gössling, Scott, & Hall, 2020), the world had not faced any other
disaster with such a massive and deleterious effect on the economy and society (Naumov,
Varadzhakova & Naydenov, 2020). While all sectors of the economy suffered a great deal from
the lockdown, quarantine, and border closures (Goodell, 2020), tourism and hospitality industries
appeared as the biggest (and most immediate) losers of the crisis (Gössling, Scott, & Hall, 2020).
The closed borders prevented scheduled flights and the quarantine measures imposed by the
governments limited the opportunities to travel to a great extent (Nicola et al., 2020).

Moreover, many tourism businesses went into default or registered huge losses, because of
limited travel consumption (Wen, Kozak, Yang, & Liu, 2020). As the growth of infections
started to slow down, governments commenced strategies to resume travel and restore economic
growth (Fakhruddin, Blanchard & Ragupathy, 2020; Collins, 2020). Preparation for the restart
requires a considerable transformation within the tourism sector, including a significant amount
of reorganisation and the integration of new protocols and standards (Lew, Cheer, Haywood,
Brouder, & Salazar, 2020). Meanwhile, consumers also changed because of the pandemic,
namely their perceptions, preferences and attitudes to travel (Peters, Peters, & Peters, 2020).
Therefore, companies’ business strategies following the pandemic inevitably should consider the
changes in tourists’ behaviour and demand (Brouder, 2020).

Tourism demand has traditionally reacted to disasters through severe declines and changes
(Page, Song, & Wu, 2011). The tourism industry has long been recognised as vulnerable to
disastrous events, implying risk for personal safety, security or health (Cró & Martins, 2017;
Estevão & Costa, 2020). Hence, the process of recovery after any disaster or force majeure
situation requires research on the shifting consumers’ attitudes and perceptions, to understand the
changes in the characteristics of the demand.

Soon after the COVID-19 outbreak, numerous publications explored this novel phenomenon and
its impact on the lives of citizens and specifically on the travel and tourism industry (Brouder et
2

al., 2020). The majority of studies focus on the current effects and the negative consequences
over diverse economic sectors (Goodell, 2020; Nicola et al., 2020), including tourism. The
studies examine deeply the supply-side perspective, estimating the damage caused, forecasting
the consequent changes and remodelling of the tourist offers (Gössling, Scott, & Hall, 2020).
However, the demand side studies remain quite scarce (Zencker & Kock, 2020), probably
because of the uncertainty in the economic aspect and the persisting risk of infection. Yet, a few
papers investigated the emerging signs of consumers’ recovery and a readiness to renew their
travel.

Being the first to announce a lockdown and the first to open, China pioneers the strategies to
revive its tourism industry (Wen, Kozak, Yang, & Liu, 2020). The Chinese tourists are expected
to travel mostly domestically due to the limitted international flights. Understandably, tourists
feel safer when travelling shorter distances from home (Enger et al., 2020). Self-guided and selfdriven trips will dominate over the group and organised tour packages (Enger et al., 2020), which
is a significant change for the Chinese tourists, who are known to prefer guided group tours and
special care during their trips (Wen et al., 2020). In a similar vein, the British are eager to book a
trip once travel is broadly permitted (Collins, 2020), but because of international restriction, they
probably will stay on the isles, thus enhancing domestic tourism in the UK. However, their
absence in other countries (Spain, France, Portugal) should have a negative impact on tourism in
those destinations (Collins, 2020), due to the change in tourism flows.

A recent study by the US Travel Association and MMGY Travel Intelligence on the travel
intentions of US citizens identifies the readiness of Americans (57%) to go on a domestic trip
(MMGY Travel Intelligence, 2020a). Driving, even for longer distances, is a preferred transport
for one-third of the respondents, and the younger travellers are most likely to initiate a trip in the
forthcoming months (MMGY Travel Intelligence, 2020a). Elliott (2020) reports almost the same
implications about the US travel demand. The most common motives for travel among
Americans are business meetings, road trips, and luxury getaways. Also, some special types of
trips will gain popularity in the post-pandemic period, like camping, couch surfing, recreational
vehicles and any other safe summer vacation ideas (Elliott, 2020). De Vos (2020) also forecasts

3

an increased interest in activities such as walking and cycling as a means to overcome the
negative physical and psychological health effects of the forced social distancing.

Sanitary precautions and health care have risen their importance as factors linked with travel
demand. It is interesting to note, however, that the stated intentions of Middle Eastern consumers
to travel depend more on the sense of safety and governmental policy, rather than on the
availability of a vaccine for the COVID-19 (Choufany, 2020). The most recently published
studies of the post-pandemic travel behaviour in Greece (Kourgiantakis, Apostolakis, & Dimou,
2020) and Indonesia (Wachyuni, & Kusumaningrum, 2020) show that the pandemic seems to
generate concern and uncertainty on multiple aspects of consumers’ everyday life (Kourgiantakis
et al., 2020), but still people have a positive attitude towards travelling and do not reveal any
excessive anxiety (Wachyuni, & Kusumaningrum, 2020). Despite the geographical and cultural
distances, customer surveys resemble the Chinese model of demand trends (Enger et al., 2020).
Industry players might consider those emerging trends, to modify their product according to the
early demand preferences and capture the first opportunities for restoring the business.

In the context of the above discussion, this article adopts a demand-side perspective and focuses
on the willingness to travel and preferences of Bulgarian consumers. By examining the travel
intentions, the study facilitates the tourism businesses in elaborating or adapting their offers to
meet the changing demand. Moreover, the results provide insights about the pace of the recovery
of the tourism demand in the country.

Methodology
Data were collected from 07 April to 07 May 2020. The researchers developed an online
questionnaire, based in Qualtrics XM, and the link to it was distributed through social media.
The questionnaire included several blocks of questions. The first block captured the demographic
characteristics of the respondents – age, gender, monthly household income, education, marital
status and previous travel experience (number of trips in the last 12 months). The second block
of questions asked about the intentions to travel, the planned frequency of travel as well as the
first intended destination to visit. Important aspects of post-pandemic travel behaviour such as
travel motivation, preferred transport, and accompanying persons formed the third block. The
4

tourists’ perceptions of the new hygiene and physical distancing protocols are explored in the
next two blocks of questions. The final sample included 974 respondents. The skewness and
kurtosis values were all were within [-2; +2] range and most values were within the range [-1;
+1]. Therefore, considering the large sample size (over 500 respondents), the empirical
distribution of responses was considered as being close to normal (Kim, 2013) which allowed the
use of parametric tests for data analysis. The data was processed and analysed through SPSS
24.0 using descriptive statistics, cross-tabulations, t-tests, ANOVA, and multinomial regression
analysis.

Results
Females are a strong majority of respondents (80.1% from the total sample), whereas the age
groups are almost evenly represented (25.7% of respondents were within the 18-30 age group,
26.4% - 31-40, 28.1% - 41-50, 14.9% - 51-60, and 4.9% were over 60 years old). The majority of
respondents have college or university degrees (79.6%), but these are also the people who travel
the most. The previous travel experience (number of trips in the last 12 months) is useful to
illustrate if the COVID-19 pandemics has influenced the regular travel style of the respondents.
The intense travel experience of 50.6% (more than 4 trips per last 12 months) shows that
respondents were active travellers.

Regarding the most significant question for the tourism industry (when will tourists renew their
trips), the results show that 33.1 percent of respondents indicate that they are going to travel
within less than a month after travel is allowed, and a further 30.2 percent will travel within 1-2
months after travel is allowed. The fact that Bulgaria was not so severely affected by the
pandemics (160 casualties as of 8th June 2020, but less than 90 by the end of the data collection
according to Worldometers, 2020) made the respondents quite optimistic and eager to renew
their travel habits. It is additionally supported by the fact that 65.2 percent of respondents intend
to travel as frequently as in the period before the pandemic. This is a really good sign for the
rapid recovery of the tourism industry, enhanced even further by the fact that 10.4 percent of the
respondents claim that they are going to travel more than in the period before the pandemics.

5

However, 53.9 percent of respondents indicate Bulgaria is their first-choice destination for travel
following the lifting of travel restrictions, rather than any destination abroad. At the time of data
collection, most of the borders were still closed without any forecasts to open soon. Moreover,
the results may reflect people’s reluctance to travel because of the risk of infection, or probably
due to the limited available funds after the period of quarantine. The findings are in line with the
results of similar studies in China, Europe, Middle East and USA (Choufaney, 2020; Collins,
2020; Elliott, 2020; Enger et al., 2020; Glusac, 2020; Kourgiantakis et al., 2020) where
respondents’ behaviour follows the same model – domestic or short-distance trips. Kourgiantakis
et al. (2020) consider that the preference for domestic trips is a shift towards localism in tourism
consumption as a result of the pandemic.
Tables 1 and 2 show the distribution of respondents’ answers regarding travel intentions,
frequency of travel, and first destination to visit, according to the monthly household income,
previous travel experience, age, and gender. The most eager to travel within less than a month
after the travel is allowed are those, who used to have 6 or more trips for the last 12 months (154
out of 271, i.e. 56.8%, Table 1). It is interesting to note that the next most active group of
travellers are those, who travelled 1-3 times for the last year – 52.4 percent (218 out of 416) from
them intend to travel again within 2 months after travel is allowed.

Expectedly, the higher the monthly income, the more respondents are willing to travel
(χ2=261.395, p=0.000). Regarding the age distribution, the respondents who will first restart
their trips are between 31-40 and 41-50 years old, i.e. the most active part of the working adult
population (see Table 2). A very interesting paradox is found for the response of the first
destination choice – younger people (less than 50 years old) choose Bulgaria or domestic travel
as their first post-pandemic destination, whereas people from the age groups over 51 years of age
are almost evenly distributed in their destination choice – within the country or abroad.
Considering the latter are among the riskiest groups who should avoid trips, it is quite
noteworthy that they do not express more concerns regarding their travel, whether domestic or
abroad.

6

Looking at the frequency of travel after the pandemic, we see that income and gender do not
influence the distribution of respondents’ answers (p>0.05). Frequency of travel is shaping
respondents’ answers (χ2=13.569, p=0.035). For example, 21.54% of people who had not
travelled during the last 12 months are expecting to travel more after the pandemic, while around
10% of other respondents are planning to do so. These non-travellers might have been persuaded
by the eliminated travel opportunities due to the closed borders and the lockdown. They might
prefer to undertake a trip while they still have an opportunity to do so. Additionally, the findings
show that 83.60% of the youngest respondents (18-30) will stay the same or increase their
travel frequency while between 70-75% of the other age groups would do so (χ2=18.101,
p=0.020). Hence, young adults have a stronger desire to travel than other generations. However,
the multinomial regression analysis (Table 3) shows that when considered simultaneously none
of the four grouping variables (monthly household income, number of trips in the last 12 months,
age, or gender) has any influence on the frequency to travel after the pandemic.

[Insert Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 about here]

In terms of the main motivation for travel, we observe a very high share of respondents wish to
travel for relaxation (46.1%), compared to any other traditional travel motivation – e.g. business
(only 7.0%). It seems that the forced stay at home due to the government’s restrictions gives
citizens the urge to leave the home to relax. The popular home office and online meetings during
the pandemics proved that business may run from home, and as a result, most of the business
arrangements went online, without the need to travel. This result contrasts the findings from the
Middle East and American markets, where the top motive for travel is business (Choufaney,
2020; MMGY Travel Intelligence, 2020a), but goes in line with the preferences of Indonesians,
who search for more nature-based holidays (Wachyuni, & Kusumaningrum, 2020).

Respondents choose the car as the preferred transport for their next trip (55.5%). Still, air
transport keeps its position with 29.1%, despite the severe decline of flights and cancellations
caused by the lockdown measures. Bulgarian tourists seem quite optimistic in their expectations
to continue travelling by air, similar to Americans (Elliott, 2020). As per the accompanying

7

person, respondents indicate that their companions will be family (51.1%), friends (23.2%) and
spouse (15.0%), in line with the findings of studies of Chinese tourists (Enger et al., 2020).

A closer look at the distribution of responses (Table 4) reveals that respondents with lower
income have stronger preferences to air transport and tourist buses, which are used by tour
operators for package trips, and the differences with the other income groups are statistically
significant (χ2=79.089 p=0.000). Hence, people with lower income will probably continue to
rely on organised package trips or low-cost airlines. This finding contrasts the Greek travel
requirements since the latter reject the traditional organised tours (Kourgiantakis et al., 2020).
Despite the geographical and cultural proximity many Bulgarians still prefer to assign the trip
organisation to somebody else, rather than do it by themselves. A similar statistically significant
difference (χ2=31.921, p=0.000) is evident for the respondents with less than 1000 BGN
monthly income (around 510 euros) when they choose a companion – their first choice is friends
(31.3%).

[Insert Table 4 about here]

Visiting friends and relatives has the largest share (32.0%) as a motive for travelling among the
youngest respondents (Table 5). The other age groups prefer either relaxation or sightseeing.
Regarding preferred transport, we observe a decreasing trend in choosing air transport with the
increase in age (χ2=72.483, p=0.000). Thus, older respondents tend to prefer tourist bus, i.e.
organised trips. Another statistically significant difference (χ2=91.311, p=0.000) is found for the
preferred companion among youngsters (18-30 years old) who choose to travel alone or have a
friend to share the trip.

[Insert Table 5 about here]

The pandemic will undeniably have an impact on travel behaviour and the choice of a destination
or an accommodation establishment. Findings from Table 6 indicate that respondents will take
extra hygiene precautions in their future trips (m=4.07), will avoid crowds whenever possible
(m=3.92), and will consider the health/safety of the destination when choosing a trip (m=3.89).
8

Safety and cleanliness seem to be the most significant “new” characteristics of the travel
behaviour since they are underlined in all other studies as well (Wachyuni, & Kusumaningrum,
2020; Kourgiantakis et al., 2020). Bulgarians’ perceptions about the level of importance of the
different factors that would influence their travel decision are presented in Table 7.

While a remote/isolated destination (m=2.67) or hotel (2.60) do not matter a lot, respondents are
more concerned about the quality of the disinfection control of rooms and facilities (m=3.87), a
reliable health system in the destination (m=3.56), and the availability of masks and sanitizers
(m=3.32). Bulgarians seem to appreciate the reliable health system of a destination, rather than
its location or popularity, and hygiene precautions in the hotels, rather than its size or location.
The t-test reveals that women have much higher safety preferences than men (all t-values in
Table 6 and most of the t-values in Table 7 are significant at p<0.001), while the ANOVA shows
that youngest respondents (18-30 years old) have lower safety preferences than older
respondents. Obviously, the stigma of risk of infection has fastened its roots in people’s minds
and will further determine its importance as the new driver of tourist demand (MMGY Travel
Intelligence, 2020b).

Conclusion and implications
The tourism industry is yet to recover from the pandemic. For the business, it is crucial to hear
the voices of customers and consider changes in travel demand. This study explored Bulgarians’
readiness and willingness to restart their travel after the lockdown. The main insights have many
common conclusions with similar studies in the USA, China and other countries. Still,
Bulgarians seem optimistic and eager to return to their regular travelling habits, but they have
also adopted the “new” protocol as an additional standard in the tourism industry. The main
characteristics of post-pandemic travel behaviour of Bulgarians stemming from the research are:
 The majority of the respondents are ready to restart travelling within 2 months after travel
is allowed;
 For their first trip, respondents will travel in the country, by car and with their family;

9

 People with lower income will rely mainly on trips by bus or air organised by tour
operators when such trips are allowed and available;
 Bulgarians will select destinations according to hygiene and safety;
 Respondents appreciate more the destinations with the most reliable health system and
the reliable disinfection systems in the destination’s accommodation establishments.
The findings reveal the changes in the travel behaviour of Bulgarians and point out the
importance of hygiene, disinfection, reliable health system and overall perception of personal
safety and security (Çelik & Dedeoğlu, 2019; Wijaya et al., 2018; Kourgiantakis et al., 2020; AlSaad, Ababnehand, & Alazaizeh, 2019). In that way, the results could help Bulgarian and foreign
tourism suppliers in developing proper marketing strategies to attract Bulgarian tourists,
following the pandemic. Emphasis on tranquillity and relaxation would be beneficial for the
destinations’ promotion, whereas tour operators should consider the limited available financial
resources of the potential tourists, and to adapt their offers accordingly, preferably for domestic
travel. Additionally, the outlined preferences would further require accommodation
establishments and other companies to introduce new health and safety protocols to address
travellers’ preferences and legal requirements. Finally, the findings show that the travel
behaviour of Bulgarians in the post-pandemic period might follow similar patterns as the travel
behaviour of the residents of other countries (Choufany, 2020; MMGY Travel Intelligence,
2020a; Kourgiantakis et al., 2020), which will further facilitate travel suppliers to elaborate their
products according to the “new” travel behaviour. The main limitation of the research is that
focuses on consumers in one country only. Future research should focus on the actual travel
behaviour of people after the pandemic to find whether the forecasted travel demand trends have
materialised.
