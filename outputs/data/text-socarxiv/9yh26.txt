Abstract
COVID-19 has had dramatic impacts on economic outcomes across the United States, yet most
research on the pandemic has had a national or urban focus. We overcome this limitation using
data from the U.S. Current Population Survey’s COVID-19 supplement to study pandemicrelated labor force outcomes from May through December of 2020 in rural and urban areas. We
find the pandemic has generally had a more severe labor force impact on urban residents than
their rural counterparts. Urban adults were more likely to be unable to work, not paid for missed
hours, and be unable to look for work due to COVID-19. However, rural workers were less
likely to be able to work remotely than urban workers. These differences persist even when
adjusting estimates for demographic composition and state-level policies, suggesting rural-urban
differences in the COVID-19 experience cannot be explained by well-known demographic and
political differences between rural and urban America.

Introduction
The economic disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have been
unprecedented in the United States, including record-high unemployment claims (Brave, Butters,
and Fogarty 2020; Brynjolfsson et al. 2020), widespread food and housing insecurity (Cowin,
Martin, and Stevens 2020; Enriquez and Goldstein 2020; Morales, Morales, and Beltran 2020),
and rising physical and emotional health challenges (Pfefferbaum and North 2020; Stainback,
Hearne, and Trieu 2020). The majority of empirical work on the pandemic to date has focused on
either the nation as a whole or the urban population, with rural areas—approximately 46 million
people—remaining largely ignored (Mueller et al. 2021).1 This evidence gap reflects an absence
of high-quality secondary data on rural areas (Hauer and Santos-Lozada 2021; Mueller et al.
2021; Pender 2020). Further, the limited evidence that is available suggests the presence of
considerable geographic heterogeneity between rural and urban areas in the pandemic’s impacts.
Due to varying patterns of disease prevalence, local mitigation strategies (Karim and Chen 2021;
Lakhani et al. 2020; Morales et al. 2020; Paul et al. 2020; Souch and Cossman 2021), and
economic structure between urban and rural areas (Lichter and Brown 2011; Vias 2012), there
are strong a priori reasons to expect rural-urban variation in the social and economic impacts of
the pandemic. Assessing this variation advances our understanding of how the pandemic has
influenced spatial and regional inequalities in the United States and has the potential to inform
mitigation and recovery policies.
We address this knowledge gap by analyzing newly-released monthly data from the
COVID-19 supplement of the U.S. Current Population Survey (CPS). We evaluate the
pandemic’s labor force impact in rural and urban areas through three objectives. First, we
estimate the monthly prevalence of four COVID-19-related employment outcomes among rural
and urban adults from May through December 2020. In doing so, we assess whether or not there
was a rural disadvantage—i.e., rural adults more often experienced negative outcomes—over the
study period and track changes in the magnitude of rural-urban differences in these outcomes
over time. Second, given well-known differences in the demographic composition and policy
context of rural and urban areas (Glasgow and Brown 2012; Lee and Sharp 2017; Thiede and
Slack 2017) we estimate a series of multiple regression models to evaluate whether any observed
rural-urban differences can be explained by these potential confounders. Finally, we evaluate
these same employment outcomes among less educated adults only, as these individuals have
been shown to be at heightened risk of layoffs, furloughs, and other disruptions (Kesler and Bash
2021). The findings from this study provide substantive lessons on the immediate impacts of
COVID-19 on rural and urban areas and can also inform longer-term relief and economic
development policies and efforts.
COVID-19 in Rural and Urban America
Scholarly attention to the COVID-19 outbreak has been centered on epidemiology and
public health, focusing on infection rates and mortality patterns. However, the socioeconomic
impacts of the pandemic are also salient and merit attention given their widespread and
potentially long-lasting impacts (Matthewman and Huppatz 2020; Ward 2020). In the early
months of the pandemic, over 26 million unemployment insurance claims were filed and over 31
percent of families reported some form of material hardship related to COVID-19 (Karpman et
al. 2020). Polyakova and colleagues (2020) found for April 2020 that employment disruptions

the terms urban and rural to refer to those living in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan counties, respectively.

were severe, with employment rates 9.8 percentage points lower than traditional Bureau of Labor
Statistics models would have projected. Rates of working remotely also greatly increased, with
one study estimating that roughly 35 percent of employed adults switched to remote work due to
COVID-19 (Brynjolfsson et al. 2020).
The risk of unemployment and other employment disruptions related to COVID-19 is
significantly affected by several demographic factors, with education principal among them
(Daly, Buckman, and Seitelman 2020; Kesler and Bash 2021). Kesler and Bash (2021) estimated
that less educated parents were between 2 and 2.5 times more likely to experience COVID-19related unemployment than highly educated parents. Employment rates in May 2020 differed by
8.8 percentage points between those with a Bachelor’s degree and those with a high school
diploma or less (Daly et al. 2020). However, these studies, as well as many other related studies,
only examined nation-wide, state-level, or metropolitan area impacts (Brave et al. 2020; Cho,
Lee, and Winters 2020), leaving little evidence about whether and how impacts varied between
rural and urban areas. This is an important gap since rurality represents an increasingly salient
axis of both health and socioeconomic inequality in the United States (Burton et al. 2013; Lichter
and Ziliak 2017; Singh and Siahpush 2014).
Indeed, rural and urban areas of the United States differ in a number of important ways
relevant to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. First, there is a marked difference in age
structure with rural areas being significantly older (Glasgow and Brown 2012; Johnson 2020).
The U.S. Census Bureau (Cheeseman Day, Hays, and Smith 2016) reports a seven year
difference in median age between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan counties (36.0 vs. 43.0
years). Differences in age structure are accompanied by differences in health (Burton et al.
2013), with rural populations characterized by higher prevalence of health-compromised
individuals and higher mortality rates than urban populations (Brooks, Mueller, and Thiede
2020; Henning-Smith 2020; Peters 2020). This rural health disadvantage may translate into
higher rates of rural adults being unable to work due to heighted fear of contracting COVID-19
(e.g., due to pre-existing conditions) or because of increased caregiving demands. Beyond these
compositional differences, access to healthcare is also lower in rural areas, likely amplifying
differences in COVID-19-related employment disruptions between rural and urban residents as
many rural residents may not be able to be tested for COVID-19 or seek medical care upon
disease contraction (Burton et al. 2013; Peters 2020; Souch and Cossman 2021). While COVID19 rates in rural counties have generally been lower than rates in urban counties (Karim and
Chen 2021; Paul et al. 2020); the exact differences in rates is difficult to estimate due to both
differences in testing (Souch and Cossman 2021) and underlying data constraints affecting data
quality for rural populations (Hauer and Santos-Lozada 2021).
Rural economies may also be more vulnerable to pandemic-related shocks. Many areas of
the rural United States are dependent on a single industry such as agriculture or natural amenityrelated tourism (Mueller 2020; Thiede and Slack 2017) and thus industry-specific shutdowns—
either governmental or self-mandated—likely have significant ripple effects on employment
throughout a rural labor market. Employment in rural America is also more precarious than
employment in urban areas as measured by rates of underemployment, labor force
nonparticipation, and working poverty (Mclaughlin and Coleman-Jensen 2014; Thiede, Lichter,
and Slack 2018). For example, Slack and colleagues (2019) find that for 2013-2017, 19.1 percent
of rural adults were underemployed to some extent compared to 17.4 percent of comparable
urban adults. Rural workers are also more likely to be self-employed or work at small businesses,
which have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic (Headd 2010; Vias 2012). Lin et
3

al. (2021) find that individuals employed at small firms—firms with less than 10 employees—
experienced COVID-19-related increases in unemployment that were nearly 7.5 percent higher
than for individuals employed at firms with over a 1000 employees. Compounding these
vulnerabilities, urban adults are more likely to have a college education than rural adults—rates
of 34.7 and 20.2 percent, respectively (Farrigan 2020). These rural disadvantages in employment
and education structure may make rural adults more prone to COVID-19-related layoffs or
furloughs and may make them less likely to be compensated for hours not worked.
Importantly, there are also reasons to expect that rural labor markets fared better during
the pandemic. Rural areas, while not as overwhelmingly white as often portrayed, are still home
to a higher proportion of white residents than urban areas (Lee and Sharp 2017; Lichter 2012).
Given significant inequalities in COVID-19 mortality, infection rates, wealth, and economic
hardships between white and non-white Americans due to deep-seated structural inequalities
(Cheng, Sun, and Monnat 2020; Dias 2021; Enriquez and Goldstein 2020; Henning-Smith,
Tuttle, and Kozhimannil 2021; Morales et al. 2020; Wrigley-Field et al. 2020), it is likely that
rural-urban differences in racial composition may create a relative rural advantage in labor force
impacts. Additionally, rural-urban differences in government mandates and shutdowns may also
suggest a rural advantage in labor force impacts (Pender 2020). For example, Adolph et al.
(2020) find that governors of primarily rural states were 31.3 percent less likely to implement
social distancing mandates in the early weeks of the pandemic than governors of more urban
states.2 This less aggressive implementation of COVID-19 policy in rural states may have led to
less dramatic labor force impacts during the pandemic. Further, many industries primarily
located in rural areas (e.g., meatpacking) were deemed essential by the federal government, and
thus many rural workers were mandated to remain at work despite high infection rates of
COVID-19 (Graff Zivin and Sanders 2020; Taylor, Boulos, and Almond 2020). Somewhat
perversely, such policies may manifest as a rural advantage in labor market outcomes. Finally,
COVID-19 has also been shown to have had less employment impacts on firms whose business
cannot be done remotely—such as agriculture and manufacturing (Lin et al. 2021)—further
suggesting a rural worker advantage.
Despite the presence of factors suggesting both a rural advantage and disadvantage, we
conduct our analysis under the hypothesis that rural adults faced more severe labor force impacts
than urban adults. Further, we expect that this rural disadvantage will be at least partially
mitigated when we control for differences in demographic composition and state-level policy.
Current Study
Our overall goal is to evaluate whether and how rural adults were disadvantaged relative
to their urban counterparts in the labor force impacts of COVID-19. Using newly-available data
from the U.S. Census Bureau, we focus on COVID-19-related disruptions to (a) work, (b) receipt
of COVID-19-related wage support, (c) employment seeking, and (d) ability to work remotely.
We assess the prevalence of these four outcomes among rural and urban adults by producing
unadjusted estimates of monthly trends and regression-adjusted estimates that control for key
demographic and state-level factors.
Data and Measures

2

Due to relative recency of research on COVID-19, adequate data on the effects of county-level mandate is not
generally available.

4

We analyze microdata from the COVID-19 supplement of the Current Population Survey
(CPS), which we extracted via IPUMS-CPS (Flood et al. 2020). Our data cover each month from
May through December of 2020, which is the entire period that the supplemental COVID-19
questions were available at the time of writing. Our analytic sample includes only working-age
civilian adults ages 18 to 65 (n = 491,651) to avoid biases associated with selective differences in
work among younger and older adults. Throughout this study we define rural and urban people
as those who live in counties which are defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget as
nonmetropolitan and metropolitan, respectively (Office of Management and Budget 2010).3 We
also stratify adults based on their education to assess whether low-education adults were
particularly hard-hit by the pandemic’s economic impacts. For that part of our analysis,
individuals are classified as less educated if they have a high school education or less (n =
178,563).4
The four labor force outcomes of interest were all asked in reference to the four weeks
preceding survey administration. Importantly, the universes of the questions varied. For whether
or not a person was unable to work due to their place of work closing or losing business due to
the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e. unable to work), the universe included all adults within the sample
(n = 491,651). Those who were employed or unemployed could report they were unable to work
due to the pandemic, thus allowing for temporary bouts of being unable to work, as well as more
permanent employment impacts. For whether or not an individual received pay for hours not
worked due to COVID-19 (paid for missed hours), the universe included those who were unable
to work because their employer closed or lost business due to COVID-19 (n = 53,228). For
whether or not an individual was unable to look for work due to the COVID-19 pandemic
(unable to look for work), the universe included anyone not in the labor force (n = 124,858).
Finally, for whether or not a person worked remotely due to COVID-19 (worked remotely), the
universe included all currently employed adults (n = 338,409).
Analytical Strategy
This study contains two sets of analysis. First, we estimate the monthly prevalence of
each outcomes of interest among rural and urban adults from May through December 2020.5
These estimates allow us to evaluate whether and how rural individuals were, overall,
advantaged or disadvantaged compared to urban adults and to evaluate if these differentials
changed over time. Second, we repeat this analysis for less educated individuals only.
Within both of the analyses defined above, we produce unadjusted estimates of monthly
trends and two sets of regression-adjusted estimates.6 We produce adjusted estimates of COVID19 outcomes produced from a series of binary logistic regression models by estimating predicted
probabilities of each outcome for both rural and urban with all other demographic and state-level
variables held at their means.

3

According to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, a county is considered metropolitan if it has either an
urban center population of at least 50,000 or is connected to another metropolitan county by at least 25% of
commuting. All counties that do not mean these criteria are classified as nonmetropolitan (Office of Management
and Budget 2010). Note that metropolitan and nonmetropolitan status is provided within the CPS, but the actual
county of residence is not. Thus, we could not include any county-level variables in our analysis.
4
Although an income stratification may be more desirable for this secondary analysis, we elect to use education
instead as within the CPS income is collected each month and is directly affected by to the outcomes being studied.
5
Monthly estimates refer to the month in which the survey was taken, as indicated by IPUMS.
6
All estimates, both unadjusted and adjusted, utilize the IPUMS-provided basic monthly person weights.

5

Each of our four outcomes is modeled as a function of a binary indicator of rural (urban)
status, month, a set of month-by-rural interactions, and a set of controls. These focal variables
allow us to estimate adjusted differences in outcomes between rural and urban adults during each
month in our data. Standard errors in these regressions are clustered on the person to account for
repeated observations inherent to the CPS sampling structure (U.S. Census Bureau 2019).7 The
first set of regressions used to produce adjusted estimates include independent control variables
which capture known differences in demographic structure—race, education, age, marital status,
sex (i.e. a dichotomous female indicator), household size, and number of children in the
household (Brown and Schafft 2018). We classify individuals as non-Hispanic White, nonHispanic Black, Hispanic of any race, non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander, and non-Hispanic
other race. We utilize four categories of education: less than a high school education, a high
school education, some college education, and a bachelor’s degree or higher. We utilize age
groups of 18-25, 25-35, 36-45, 46-55, and 56-65 years old. Finally, we use three marital status
groups: married, divorced, separated, or widowed, and single.
The second set of adjusted estimates—which we refer to as policy-adjusted estimates—
are based on similar logistic regressions which include additional controls for state policies and
socioeconomic context as captured by an indicator for state-level at-restaurant dining closures
and state fixed effects. Using data produced by Raifman et al. (2020), we create an indicator for
whether or not an individual was experiencing a state-level at-restaurant dining closure—
meaning restaurants were prohibited from serving individuals at the restaurant, either inside or
outside—during the month of interest. This type of policy has been dynamic at the state level
over the study period and we expect it to be correlated with other pandemic-related restrictions.
We also capture time-invariant state factors through the use of state fixed effects, which account
for all time-invariant factors at the state level including economic and political structure. The
regression models for the analysis of less educated adults matches the form of these models but
differ in that they only include less educated individuals.8
Results
We begin with a broad focus on employment and find that the labor force impacts of the
COVID-19 pandemic varied significantly between working-age adults (18 to 65) in the rural and
urban United States. Employment among those in the labor force declined dramatically in both
rural and urban areas. Compared to pre-pandemic (January) employment rates of 95.1 percent
and 96.1 percent, in May, just 57.8 percent of rural adults and 41.2 percent of urban adults
worked with no COVID-19 related disruptions. Non-disrupted employment rose by December—
but not to pre-pandemic levels—increasing to 82.1 percent and 64.6 percent for rural and urban
areas, respectively.
Next, we consider the prevalence of self-reported inability to work due to the pandemic.
Consistent with these broader trends of employment, in May, 20.0 percent of rural adults
reported being unable to work due to COVID-19 compared to 23.0 percent of urban adults (Fig.
1A). The prevalence of this outcome declined significantly by December, with a 14.9
percentage-point decrease in rural areas and a 15.5 percentage-point decline in urban areas—
lowering the rural-urban difference to 2.3 percentage points. When adjusting for relevant
demographic and state-level policy characteristics the rural advantage remained, suggesting that
7

Households are included in the CPS for four consecutive months, off for eight months, and then included for
another four consecutive months.

rural adults were advantaged relative to urban adults over and above demographic composition.
However, for May, rural-urban disparities in the policy-adjusted estimates is halved to 1.2
percentage points. The changes from model to model suggest that a substantial share—up to
half—of the disparities in the early months of the pandemic may be attributed to differences in
state-level business closure and reopening policies.
We also find evidence of a rural advantage in the prevalence of being paid for hours not
worked due to COVID-19. In May, 22.2 percent of relevant rural adults reported being paid for
missed work, which was 5.0 percentage points higher than the rate among corresponding urban
adults (17.2%). Rural-urban differences in pay for those unable to work decreased by December
to 3.0 percentage points, with rural and urban rates at 15.8 percent and 12.8 percent, respectively
(Fig. 1B). The prevalence of being paid for hours not worked decreased for both groups,
indicating that being unable to work became more perilous over time. Our adjustments only
explain a modest portion of the rural-urban difference. For example, May and December
demographics-adjusted rural-urban differences both remained above 4.8 points and policyadjusted differences both above 3.2 points—indicating the presence of a rural advantage over
and above compositional and state-level factors.
Next, we find that the prevalence of being unable to look for work due to COVID-19—
which was only asked of adults not in the labor force—was lower in rural than urban areas. The
rural advantage was a full 8.2 percentage points in May and remained at 4.0 points in December
(Fig. 1C). In May, 8.4 percent of relevant rural adults were unable to look for work, slightly
more than half of the rate for urban adults (16.6%). By December, prevalence of this outcome
declined in both areas to 4.0 percent and 8.0 percent, respectively. When adjusting for
demographic and state-policy characteristics, we find that rural areas were still advantaged and
were less likely to report being unable to look for work due to COVID-19 during most months.
Unlike the other outcomes, there are several months in which the rural and urban unadjusted and
adjusted estimates have clear overlap, and most month-by-rural coefficients are non-significant
in the regression model (see supplemental materials). While there is a general rural advantage for
this outcome, the advantage is more dynamic and flexible than other labor market outcomes.
Our final outcome of interest is the ability to work remotely, which was measured among
employed adults. This is the only source of a rural disadvantage that we find in our analysis.
Urban adults were decidedly more likely to work remotely than their rural contemporaries. In
May, 19.8 percent of rural employed adults worked remotely, compared to 38.4 percent of urban
employed adults—a difference of 18.6 points. Rates of working remotely decreased by
December in rural and urban areas to 9.3 percent and 26.3 percent, respectively, with a large
difference of 17.0 percentage points remaining. Also, unlike the other outcomes, we find a
sizeable portion of the rural-urban difference in working remotely can be attributed to
compositional factors (Fig. 1D). The demographic adjusted rural-urban differences are 4.9
percentage points lower in May and 4.5 points lower in December than the corresponding
unadjusted values. Accounting for policy differences lowers rural-urban differences by 7.3 and
5.8 points for these months, respectively. The implication is that a notable portion of the ruralurban difference in remote work can be explained by rural-urban differences in demographic
characteristics—education likely chief among them—as well as state-level policy factors.
Impacts among Less Educated Adults

8

We now focus on the COVID-19 impacts experienced among less-educated rural and
urban adults. In May, 26.1 percent of less-educated urban adults reported being unable to work,

outcomes for less-educated rural and urban adults by month. Shaded area is 95% confidence
interval.

which is 6.6 percentage points higher than among rural adults (Fig. 2A). The same disparity
among all rural and urban adults was 3.0 points. By December, the rural-urban advantage had
declined to 4.3 points, which is still higher than the advantage observed for rural adults of all
education levels for that month (2.3%). We find that rural-urban differences are still present after
both the demographic and policy adjustments; with a May advantage of 4.1 and 3.1 points,
respectively.
Less educated adults in both rural and urban areas were relatively unlikely to receive pay
for missed hours (Fig. 2B). In rural areas, only 18.1 percent of such rural adults were paid for
missed work in May, and by December this rate had declined to just 12.0 percent. Urban adults
experienced a much smaller May to December decline at 2.3 points (13.0% vs. 10.8%). We find
that the rural advantage was slightly smaller during the study period for less educated adults than
among all adults. Further, the rural advantage in this outcome is still present even when
including demographic and policy adjustments. We conclude that the vast majority of less
educated adults (over 80%) who were unable to work were not compensated for missed hours,
and that the rural advantage in this outcome cannot simply be explained due to demographic or
state-level policy factors.
Like with the analysis of all adults, we find that less-educated rural adults reported being
unable to look for work due to COVID-19 less often. In May, 8.7 percent of less-educated rural
adults not in the labor force reported being unable to look for work due to COVID-19, compared
to 16.2 percent of urban adults—a difference of 7.5 points (Fig. 2C). The unadjusted rural
advantage in December stood at 3.9 points as rural and urban rates fell from 16.2 to 7.9 percent
during the study period, respectively. In general, these trends match the findings among all adults
(i.e., our full sample). We also find that demographic and policy adjustments do not explain all
of these rural-urban differences, as in May our demographic and policy-adjusted estimates
produce a rural advantage of 5.5 and 4.7 points, respectively.
Rates of working remotely differ greatly between our two analyses, with less educated
adults being significantly less likely to work remotely. In May—the month with the highest rates
of remote work—only 6.9 percent of rural less-educated employed adults worked remotely,
compared to 19.8 percent of all employed rural adults (Fig. 2D). Our estimates reveal a large
25.0-point difference in urban areas as well (13.4% vs. 38.4%). Demographic and policy
adjustments explain much less of the rural-urban differences in working remotely among less
educated adults than in our full sample analysis—leaving a clear urban advantage for this
outcome.
Discussion and Conclusions
The purpose of this study was to evaluate disparities in COVID-19-related labor force
disruptions experienced by rural and urban adults, and to assess to what extent these disparities
can be explained by rural-urban differences in demographic composition and policy. While we
outlined a number of reasons to expect rural residents to be more affected by the COVID-19
pandemic than urban peers, this does not hold true under our analysis. We find that rural adults
were less likely to report being unable to work or unable to look for work due to COVID-19, and
were more likely to be paid for missed hours. This rural advantage persists even when
accounting for rural-urban differences in demographic composition and state-level factors.
Importantly, these rural advantages may reflect differences in the types of jobs typically
worked by rural and urban Americans—which were, at best, captured partially by our state fixed
effects. Employment sectors common in rural areas—agriculture, natural resources, and
10

manufacturing—were often deemed essential, could not be done remotely (Lin et al. 2021), and
in some cases were even mandated to remain open (Taylor et al. 2020). Rural workers are also
less likely to be unionized than their urban counterparts (Brady, Baker, and Finnigan 2013;
Thiede and Slack 2017), potentially resulting in many rural workers not having the bargaining
power to opt out of work during high risk times. Rural school districts were also less likely to
close or go remote (Gross and Opalka 2020), which in turn may have meant that many rural
parents did not have to leave work temporarily or be unable to look for work due to childcare
needs unlike many urban parents. Counter-intuitively, many of the potential sources of this rural
advantage in the labor force impacts of COVID-19 are rooted in the region’s socioeconomic
disadvantage relative to urban America.
The one exception to this rural advantage narrative pertains to remote work. Urban adults
were more likely to work remotely throughout the study period, but the gap between rural and
urban workers significantly decreases when accounting for compositional and state-level factors.
In addition to rural-urban occupational differences, the remaining urban advantage may be
explained by more prevalent home internet access in urban areas (Perrin 2019). Hence, many
rural individuals would be unable to work from home even if the option was available from their
employer.
Less educated adults in both rural and urban areas experienced heightened labor force
challenges relative to the general population. This population was particularly disadvantaged in
their likelihood of being paid for missed hours and ability to work remotely. This temporary loss
of income likely put these individuals and their families in a very unstable economic position and
likely severely affected household food security and other forms of wellbeing (Cowin et al.
2020; Morales et al. 2020). While the loss of wages or employment may have been temporary for
these families, the impacts may be long term; it is likely that these marginalized groups
experienced the pandemic’s economic disruptions in ways that cannot be measured via currently
available CPS data (Van Lancker and Parolin 2020).
Indeed, there are at least two notable limitations to the study that stem from our data.
First, questions related to one’s industry of employment are only asked of those currently
working by the CPS. We are therefore unable to directly assess how much of the estimated rural
advantage in labor force impacts is due to industrial compositional differences between rural and
urban adults. Such differences are only partially captured by state-fixed effects and cannot be
differentiated from other state-level factors absorbed in those terms. While previous research has
established that certain industries in rural areas were mandated to stay open (Taylor et al. 2020),
the extent to which rural and urban adults working similar jobs were impacted differently by
COVID-19 has yet to be assessed. Second, the CPS does not provide the county of residence of
all respondents, which prevents us from considering the differential impacts of county-level
COVID-19 mandates and closures between rural and urban areas. Future research on the
differences in impact of COVID-19 in rural and urban areas should address these gaps through
the use of alternative data sources.
The COVID-19 pandemic will have significant near and long-term impacts; impacts that
will not be felt equally across society or space. As documented here, urban and rural people have
experienced the pandemic quite differently over and above what can be explained by differences
in demographic composition and state-level policy. Contrary to what may have been expected
from concerns voiced previously (Henning-Smith 2020; Paul et al. 2020; Peters 2020; Souch and
Cossman 2021), we find the labor force impacts in urban areas have largely been more severe
than those felt in rural areas—with the ability to work remotely being the key exception. There
