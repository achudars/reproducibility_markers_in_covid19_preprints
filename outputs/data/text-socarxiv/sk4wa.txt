Executive summary
Key points
We have not yet seen the full effect of COVID-19 and the subsequent
economic crisis, but this early analysis of the COVID19 module of the
Australian Rental Housing Conditions Dataset (ARHCD) suggests that
the rental sector will be where many of the upcoming challenges for
Australia overlap.
•

The COVID-19 module captures a ‘snapshot’ of circumstances for
Australian renters. The initial findings, presented here, suggest a
policy-important cohort of tenants in Australia are lined up on the
brink of a financial precipice. Many renters are currently buffered
from the full economic effects of the pandemic by their savings,
their superannuation, and rent deferment, as well as temporary
government supports in the form of eviction moratoriums,
JobKeeper and JobSeeker.

•

The impacts of COVID-19 across the rental sector are, in many
respects, still emerging, and this presents a real challenge for policymakers in developing targeted and effective assistance. While policy
responses may, in the short term, focus on protective mechanisms,
such as eviction moratoriums, the systemic nature of the challenges
faced by renters suggests that long-term recovery will be most
effectively realised through system-wide policy shifts.

•

Challenges for effective policy response include the need to provide
targeted assistance quickly, to provide a framework of certainty
that enables all stakeholders in the rental sector to plan for the
future (e.g. tenants, landlords, housing providers, social services),
and to anticipate what issues may evolve in an extended pandemic.

•

Without control of COVID-19 and the associated health risks, there
can be no recovery for the Australian economy. Housing is at the
frontline of interventions—and, as such, is a potential weakness
in recovery.

Executive summary

Key findings
The COVID-19 pandemic, and the subsequent economic and social lockdown, has rapidly changed our housing
system: the way we use our homes, our ability to afford them, and the role of government safety nets. The
rental sector, where almost a third of Australians live—and where 20 per cent of Australians invest—has been
dramatically affected. Large numbers of renting households have been thrown into precarious employment, or
even unemployment, with many now finding it difficult to make housing payments. Tenure insecurity has become
a pressing risk for many renters.
We report here on a survey of 15,000 renters, with data collected during July and August 2020—a time when many
Australian state borders were closed, social distancing measures were in force across the nation, and various
levels of extended lockdown were affecting employment and the economy. Building on existing research and a
scheduled data collection of Australian renters (as detailed in Baker, Daniel et al. 2018)1, this Australian Housing
and Urban Research Institute (AHURI) rapid response project added a focussed module exploring the effects,
vulnerabilities and experiences of renting households during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The COVID-19 module aimed to address the pressing need among the policy and research community for robust
and timely data. Further, it was designed through a consultation process to directly respond to the key data
requirements nominated by policy stakeholders. Our consultation with these stakeholders highlighted a need
to capture data reflecting: employment and income change, rent reductions and deferrals, evictions, use of the
home for work and study, mental and other health effects, the usefulness of government supports, and renter
expectations for the future.
Preliminary analysis of the dataset shows that almost all tenants were affected in some way (often in multiple
ways) across and beyond their employment, living environment, ability to pay rent, and risk of eviction. Overall,
this data suggests that a policy-important cohort of tenants in Australia are lined up on the brink of a financial
precipice. Many renters are currently buffered from the full economic effects of the pandemic by their savings,
their superannuation, and rent deferment, as well as a temporary guardrail of government supports in the form
of eviction moratoriums, JobKeeper and JobSeeker.
Importantly, the dual health and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are still evolving. If (or as) the
pandemic progresses, savings and superannuation buffers will eventually run out, making these renters entirely
dependent on packages of government support. In the absence of an effective and accessible vaccine, it is likely
that the situation for renters captured in this mid2020 snapshot will be different (and almost certainly worse) by
mid-2021.
The following findings illustrate the scale of effect shown in the data.
•

There is clear evidence of increased stress and anxiety across Australia’s renting population, with almost half
of all households surveyed reporting experiencing stress and anxiety as a result of COVID-19. When asked
about the ways in which their living situation had been affected, about a third of tenants said they struggled
to make ends meet or had skipped meals.

•

The broader financial hardship faced by many of the respondents was a strong theme in the verbatim
responses: for example, the inability to save, cancellation of services and memberships, and reliance on
charitable services.

•

Just over 60 per cent of households experienced some change to their employment or income circumstances,
across variables including reduced working hours, retrenchment, temporary lay-off, and income decrease.

Executive summary

•

Just over 5 per cent of respondents had received an eviction notice since the start of the pandemic.

•

One in three respondents had requested, or were planning to ask for, a rent reduction or deferral. (Notably,
of those who had requested a rent change, 42% were granted a rent reduction, 17% entered into a rent deferral
arrangement, but 30% had their request declined and 6% were still waiting to hear back.)

•

Among the households surveyed, there was widespread reference to the value of the JobKeeper and
JobSeeker assistance packages. We note, though, a slight difference in the way that each of these assistance
packages appeared to be viewed by tenants. Respondents repeatedly described the value of JobKeeper
in keeping them ‘afloat’ and allowing them to 'make ends meet’. Diversely, the increased income for some
households associated with elevated JobSeeker payments appeared to provide improvements to their living
situation that were often beyond their pre-COVID-19 situation.

•

There was generalised concern among respondents in regard to what would happen when these temporary
support payments ceased.

•

When renters were asked about the future and whether they anticipated requiring additional government
support in the next 12 months, approximately a third expected they would require further support, a further
30 per cent were uncertain, and the remaining 40 per cent did not expect to require further support.

•

Renters who anticipated that they would need financial assistance in the next 12 months were almost six
times more likely than other renters to report that their mental health had significantly declined as a result
of COVID-19.

•

At the time of data collection, roughly one in eight renters had accessed their superannuation in order to
meet their living costs, and a third of renters had accessed their savings in order to make ends meet during
the pandemic.

This data snapshot potentially indicates a substantial shift in the quality of life for many Australians following
the advent of COVID-19. These initial findings do, however, give policy-makers some guidance as to where
intervention might be most effectively applied to mitigate future damage to Australian rental households (e.g. via
increased income support payments, securing stable housing for all, and strengthening housing and employment
safety nets).

Reflections for policy
Housing is at the frontline of COVID-19 interventions—and, as such, a potential weakness to other interventions.
For example, a workforce obliged to continue working when feeling unwell because of high housing costs presents
a risk to the effective control of COVID-19. In addition to affordability, other housing issues fundamental to the
recovery of the economy include access to housing that is secure, uncrowded, and able to be maintained with
high levels of hygiene and thermal comfort.
In framing priorities for policy response, this preliminary analysis of the COVID19 module suggests the following.
It is likely that there will be a sustained increase in the number of renting households requiring some form
of assistance in the medium term at least.
•

There is a need for a coordinated, universal framework for landlord–tenant negotiations.

•

The lack of certainty about future government assistance is harming people’s mental health.

•

Policy interventions need to be carefully targeted.

•

Following this rapid response work, systematic analysis of this dataset should be undertaken to provide
a more detailed identification of the population cohorts most likely to benefit from interventions (and the
forms of interventions most likely to assist in the control of the pandemic).

•

As the pandemic progresses, there will almost certainly be an ongoing need to monitor the effects on rental
households, to provide further ‘snapshots’ that capture evolving requirements and effects.

Executive summary

The study
This Research Project capitalised on a large-scale data collection project, the 2020 Australian Rental Housing
Conditions Dataset (ARHCD), to add a focussed COVID-19 module. Data for the COVID-19 module was collected
in July and August 2020. The module covered all Australian states and territories, and gathered information on
the experiences of Australia’s renting households: the assistance they accessed; their concerns and plans; and
their requirements to ‘rebound’. In addition to the dataset creation, this project presents an initial analysis of the
COVID-19 module.
This study was designed to acknowledge the short-, medium- and long-term challenges facing decision-makers,
and the need for better insights into how the rental market is performing, the uptake of existing support measures,
and the demand for future assistance.
This project was framed around four interlinked stages. Stage 1 was consultative: a series of structured interviews
were undertaken with policy stakeholders from each Australian state/territory to identify key themes of interest
and issues of emerging importance to policy development. From this initial round of consultation, a Policy Issues
Paper was produced (Baker, Beer, et al. forthcoming), summarising the leading items of policy interest, and calling
for feedback and comment. The COVID-19 module was subsequently designed to reflect the findings of this
consultation process. In Stage 2, data collection using a commercial provider was commissioned. Analysis of the
preliminary dataset was undertaken in Stage 3. The dataset will be lodged with the Australian Data Archive, for
broader public access, following the required embargo.

1. The collection of rapid rental insights: policy priorities and approach 

1.1 The development and collection of data infrastructure
In mid-2020, the largest systematic collection of data on living in the Australian rental sector—the Australian
Rental Housing Conditions Dataset (ARHCD)—was scheduled to occur. Funded by the Australian Research
Council (ARC) in partnership with six Australian universities, the ARHCD was to gather information from 15,000
(public and private) renting households across all Australian states and territories. The aim of the ARHCD was
to create a publicly available resource for research and government stakeholders, so that policy decisions
could be based on a robust understanding of conditions in the rental sector, and a detailed profile of who lives
in rental housing in 2020 Australia, and their housing needs. The AHURI-funded COVID-19 module was designed
to leverage the timing and scale of this major Australian data collection project, and to quickly collect the data
that the policy and research community needed.

Stage 1: Stakeholder consultation and module development
Undertaken during the first period of national social distancing restrictions, this stage sought to garner the
views and priorities of policy stakeholders across all Australian states and territories, via a series of telephone
and remote conference meetings. Meetings were structured around a series of discussion topics that had
been identified as important during preliminary discussions, such as: security of tenure, protection of mental
health, the role of rental agents in negotiating tenancy assistance, patterns of rent reduction, eviction, access
to superannuation, difficulty meeting housing costs, isolation, and working or studying from home.
The key issues arising from these meetings were synthesised into a Policy Briefing paper which was subsequently
circulated to participants for comment. From this, a series of key policy issues were identified:
1.

changes in employment or loss of income

2. whether tenants have negotiated rent reductions or deferrals; whether these were successful and, if so, what
they have agreed upon
3. the influence of property agents on tenant–landlord negotiations
4. whether tenants have been evicted or threatened with eviction
5. effects of COVID-19 on people’s living situations
6. whether residents’ homes have provided them with enough space to work or study from home
7. whether housing-related issues have affected mental health
8. what government supports tenants have received or anticipate requiring
9. the confidence of renting households to ‘rebound’ from economic hardship or retrenchment.
The research team translated the issues identified into a module of survey questions. Ethical approval was sought
and granted by The University of Adelaide Human Research Ethics Committee (H-2020-069).

2. Rental households’
COVID-19 experiences
•

The majority of respondents had experienced significant changes to
their employment and income because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

•

There is evidence that the pandemic caused financial hardship,
stress and anxiety among many rental households.

•

Tenants’ housing circumstances were precarious, with one in twenty
having received an eviction notice. Rent relief processes were highly
individualised.

•

Many rental households had accessed their superannuation or used
their savings to meet housing and living costs during the pandemic.

•

The JobKeeper/JobSeeker programs had provided important
safety nets for many tenants, though there was concern about the
anticipated wind-back of the schemes.

•

Around a third of renters expected that they would need longer-term
government support in recovering from COVID-19-related financial
hardship.

2.1 Analysis of the preliminary COVID-19 module dataset
The following analyses are drawn from a preliminary version of the COVID-19 module dataset. This preliminary dataset
contains information on the housing, economic, health and demographic characteristics of 13,289 renting households
nationally, together with responses to the COVID-19-specific questions. The dataset comprises a balanced sample
across age cohorts, gender, location and landlord type. All survey respondents resided in rented accommodation
—either in the private rental sector or in public/community housing—at the time that they participated in the survey.
Quotas were used to achieve representativeness by state/territory and landlord type. Respondents living in social
housing (public and community sectors) were purposely over-sampled to allow for adequate sample sizes when
stratified in future analysis.

2. Rental households’ COVID-19 experiences 

There are no up-to-date Australian statistics to which we can compare the ARHCD sample across dwelling type,
size and condition; however, the preliminary findings are consistent with the characteristics of rented houses
represented in the 2016 Australian Housing Conditions Survey (Baker, Daniel et al. 2018). Roughly reflecting the
broader rental sector, just under 80 per cent of renting households were in the private sector, 13 per cent rented
from a social housing provider, and the remaining portion rented from an employer or other landlord type. The
age distribution of responding persons was slightly skewed to the younger or working ages: 22 per cent were
aged over 50 years, 48 per cent were aged between 30 and 49 years, and the remaining 28 per cent were aged
18 to 29 years. There were more female respondents than male (59% compared with 41%).

2.1.1 Changes in employment or loss of income
The majority of rental households (63%) had experienced changes to their employment or income due to the

retrenchment (5%), around 10 per cent had experienced complete loss of income and a further
COVID-19 pandemic. Reduced hours (22%) or reduced income (19%) were the most commonly reported impacts,
13 per cent had experienced temporary job loss.

Perhaps even more enlightening are the large number of responses given to the question, ‘Why did you not ask
your landlord or agent for a rent reduction due to COVID-19?’ Among the responses of the more than 700 people
who volunteered extra information, the four main reasons were: they did not require assistance, they did not ask
because they anticipated refusal, they were too embarrassed to ask, or they were concerned about keeping their
rental record unblemished. Example responses include the following.
‘Got an email from them saying to not even bother and to remind us that if we fell behind, we would

‘My landlord is elderly and relies on my rent.’

3. Policy development options
The COVID-19 module of the ARHCD captures a snapshot of circumstances for Australian renters. The initial
findings, presented in this report, suggest a policy-important cohort of tenants in Australia are lined up on the brink
of a financial precipice. Many renters are currently buffered from the full economic effects of the pandemic by their
savings, their superannuation, and rent deferment, as well as a temporary guardrail of government supports in the
form of eviction moratoriums, JobKeeper and JobSeeker. Importantly, though, the dual health and economic effects
of the COVID-19 pandemic are still evolving. If (or as) the pandemic progresses, for many renters, their savings
and superannuation buffers will eventually run out, making them entirely dependent on packages of government
support. In the absence of an effective and accessible vaccine, it is likely that the situation for renters captured in
this mid-2020 snapshot will be different (and almost certainly worse) by mid-2021.
The evolving nature of the pandemic presents a challenge for policy-makers. Just as with health responses,
housing responses need to simultaneously address short, medium, and long term needs. They need to provide
targeted assistance quickly, provide a framework of certainty to enable all stakeholders in the rental sector
(tenants, landlords, housing providers, social services) to plan for the future, and they need to anticipate what
may evolve in an extended pandemic.
In developing better frameworks and policies, policy-makers should be aware of the broader context within
which housing responses to COVID-19 are located. As the discussion in Section 2 has shown, the impact of
the pandemic on tenants varies considerably across states/territories with respect to indicators such as the
incidence of loneliness, relationship difficulties with partner, the loss of all or part employment, and rental
unaffordability. As expected, some of the most acute impacts have been felt in Victoria and New South Wales,
the jurisdictions with the highest incidence of COVID-19. However, on some indicators the Northern Territory,
ACT and Western Australia show signs of significant stress—despite the low (relative and absolute) incidence of
COVID-19 in these jurisdictions. This outcome draws attention to the fact that the impact of COVID-19 on private
tenants is a product of the interaction between the incidence of the virus on the one hand, and the economic and
social structure on the other.
•

In the ACT, the combination of an expensive private rental market and a relatively fluid, younger workforce
has made tenants vulnerable to shocks such as COVID-19.

•

In Western Australia and the Northern Territory, reliance on industries such as tourism and resources
development has been associated with a population of renters dependent on long-distance commuting
and tourism, both of which have been affected by COVID-19.

These findings emphasise that economic recovery is fundamental to delivering more secure and affordable
housing for those in the private rental market. It also highlights that housing policy is central to achieving
economic recovery, as accommodation that is secure, uncrowded and able to be maintained with high levels of
hygiene and thermal comfort will be fundamental to the recovery of the economy. Personnel obliged to continue
working when feeling unwell because of high housing costs are a risk to the effective control of COVID-19.

3. Policy development options 

A recent study by the Australian Government’s National Skills Commission (NSC 2020) concluded that the nation
needs to have control of COVID-19 and associated health risks before the economy can recover. This conclusion
was based on a survey of businesses across Australia over the three weeks ending 10 July 2020. Critically, half
of all businesses surveyed said another outbreak of COVID-19 was the biggest potential threat to their ongoing
viability. As would be expected, the risk of employees contracting COVID-19 was of greatest concern in some
industries. Recent outbreaks in aged care facilities in Victoria underpin the severity of this risk, especially as
staff are potentially confronted with the challenge of working across a number of sites, and being exposed in the
broader community.
Overall, the key message to emerge from the NSC (2020) report is that without control of COVID-19 and
associated health risks there can be no recovery for the Australian economy. Effective housing policy to reduce
the incidence, duration and impact of COVID-19 on the Australian population is essential both economically and with
respect to public health. A fully and effectively functioning economy will also work to reduce the incidence of social
isolation and clinical mental health issues by reducing the anxiety felt by many and allowing greater social integration.
In broad terms, housing policies need to do the following.
•

•

Reduce the impact and severity of unaffordable housing in order to:
•

allow people in high risk workplaces to absent themselves from work when appropriate

•

limit the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on mental health

•

encourage people to engage in education and/or retraining to secure their economic future

•

reduce or remove the impact of COVID-19 and associated employment insecurity on the educational
outcomes of children.

Look to the outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic and consider ways to make both the housing stock and
housing programs more resilient in the face of comparable future events.

The data contained in this AHURI-funded COVID-19 module suggests a series of policy development directions
and priorities.
•

Regardless of the form and timing of extensions to interventions such as JobKeeper and JobSeeker, it is
likely that there will be a sustained increase in the number of renting households requiring some form of
assistance in the medium term at least. With this in mind, policy focus is no doubt already turned to resourcing
and expanding the options for government and non-government provided accommodation assistance, such
as domestic violence shelters, temporary and emergency accommodation, and social housing. In forward
planning, the timing of the lifting of the moratorium on evictions will be important. Tenants receiving eviction
notices will require immediate support for relocation, and this support should be holistic, taking into account
continuity of education for children (noting that many of the most disadvantaged households include children)
and employment for adult household members.

•

There is a clear need for a coordinated, universal framework for landlord–tenant negotiations. As we
moved into the pandemic, a key characteristic of the Australian rental sector was its fragmented structure.
This meant that when the economic shutdowns began, individual tenant households were, in a great many
cases, negotiating COVID-19 responses with individual landlords or agents. The data suggests that some
population groups were especially disadvantaged in this process. Further, the lack of clear guidelines, or the
presence of a framework for these discussions, resulted in uneven outcomes.

•

The lack of certainty about future government assistance is harming people’s mental health. This is reflected
in the data showing that renters who anticipated they would need financial assistance in the next 12 months were
six times as likely to report a deterioration in their mental health. Tenants need more certainty to allow them to
plan into the future—to the extent that this is possible in an era of evolving health and economic crises. It is clear
that, even though an indicative March 2021 expiry date for JobKeeper/JobSeeker packages currently exists, this
assistance will be required by many Australian households well beyond that date. Our analysis suggests that
removing the indicative expiry date, thereby guaranteeing that a welfare assistance safety net will exist beyond
March 2021, would form an important mental health intervention.

3. Policy development options 

•

Policy interventions need to be targeted. The COVID-19 module clearly indicates that some population
cohorts have been especially affected in the pandemic. For example, households with low to moderate
household incomes (<$90,000/annum) are more likely than even slightly higher income households to have
struggled to make ends meet. Households with children, particularly one-parent families, stand out as needing
priority access to financial or housing-related forms of assistance. It is important to note that the mental
health effects of the pandemic also appear to have been uneven, and therefore some key groups are flagged
as particularly vulnerable. More than half of all private renters, for example, identified that their mental health
had declined significantly as a result of the pandemic. Social renters, on the other hand, reported a much
lower prevalence of mental health decline. Although further work needs to be undertaken to understand this
difference, it is likely driven by concerns about security of tenure in the private rental sector, and the stress
of negotiating with individual landlords. Women also seem to have been more vulnerable to negative mental
health effects, and younger people appear to have been affected much more than older people. In a cautious
economic environment, these findings give clear initial guidance on who should be prioritised for intervention.

•

We note that the findings presented here represent a rapid response, preliminary analysis of the data.
Following this report, we recommend that systematic analysis of this dataset be undertaken to provide
a more detailed identification of the population cohorts most likely to benefit from the various potential
interventions.

•

Critically, this dataset represents a ‘snapshot’ of tenant experiences during the COVID19 pandemic, providing
the essential basis for policy stakeholders and researchers to robustly measure and understand the effects of
the outbreak on Australians. As the pandemic progresses, there will almost certainly be an ongoing need
to monitor these effects via repeat surveys (perhaps using a defined set of indicators of progress), to
provide further ‘snapshots’ that capture evolving requirements and effects—at least in the medium term
(2021).

3.1 Final remarks
We have not yet seen the full effect of COVID-19 and the subsequent economic crisis. The findings of this report
suggest that the rental sector will be where many of the upcoming challenges for Australia overlap. Even before
COVID-19, there were acknowledged problems within the sector: poor affordability, variable dwelling quality and
condition, and tenure insecurity. Many of these issues have been amplified during the pandemic. Further, renters
have been particularly vulnerable to the economic effects of the shutdown, being generally less attached to the
labour market than homeowners, having slightly lower incomes, and with a higher rate of employment in the
industries most affected by the lockdown measures.
In many respects, our preliminary findings serve to underline the importance of government-provided safety nets
in Australia—though they also reveal significant cracks within the system from which many households are not
able to rebound. While policy responses may, in the short term, focus on protective mechanisms like eviction
moratorium, the systemic nature of the challenges faced by residents within the rental sector suggests that
long-term recovery will be most effectively realised through system-wide policy shifts.
Overall, this preliminary analysis of the COVID-19 module presents some clear policy guidance.
•

It is likely that there will be a sustained increase in the number of renting households requiring some form
of assistance in the medium term at least.

•

There is a need for a coordinated, universal framework for landlord–tenant negotiations.

•

The lack of certainty about future government assistance is harming people’s mental health.

•

Policy interventions need to be carefully targeted.

•

Following this rapid response work, further systematic analysis of the dataset should be undertaken to provide
a more detailed identification of the population cohorts most likely to benefit from interventions (and the
forms of interventions most likely to assist in the control of the pandemic).

•

As the pandemic progresses, there will almost certainly be an ongoing need to monitor the effects on rental
households, to provide further ‘snapshots’ that capture evolving requirements and effects.
