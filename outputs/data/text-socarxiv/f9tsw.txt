Introduction
Despite the failures to tackle early coordinated responses at national and multinational
levels1, the global emergence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic promoted
unprecedented actions on the science-policy, science-communication, and science-diplomacy
interfaces worldwide. With varying degrees of success, various actions within the realm of
science diplomacy have accompanied the creation of knowledge related to COVID-19 through
international collaboration

2 3 4 5 6.

The COVID-19 pandemic brought the world to a standstill

and also drew attention to the genuine need for science diplomacy

7 8 9 10.

This pandemic

highlighted the need of training opportunities in the interface of policy and diplomacy for
researchers to be able to get grips on emerging health issues. Moreover, it is necessary to
create specific platforms for experts to interact with decision-makers at the national and
international levels, especially in the Global South. This crisis inevitably shifted the focus on
scientific areas that directly address the pandemic response (epidemiology, public health,
virology, immunology, pharmacology, human behavioral research, economics, among others).
At the same time, some areas not related to the pandemic response have been slowed down
due to inevitable physical and social restrictions that impacted certain aspects of the academic
life. This does not only relate to daily access to the lab, scientific collections, or field sites, but
also associates with furloughed employees and reduced funding to non-COVID-19-related
research

11 12 13 14.

Moreover, during the pandemic, women and (usually young) scientists with

children have reduced their research efforts substantially, with future implications still difficult to
quantify

15.

While some researchers might have harnessed telecommuting and lockdown

periods to focus on data analysis and publication writing, gender bias still exists

16 17.

The slight

increase in publications with pre-acquired data may still be followed by an immediate future
impacted by the lack of data acquisition during the pandemic. These issues may create longterm effects due to reduced capacity for generating pre-requisite data for securing new
funding, termination of research, reduced networking opportunities, restrictions to international
collaborations, collectively having a negative impact on other disciplines. While most
established researchers may not be affected hardly by the above-mentioned effects, early
career researchers (ECRs), represent a more vulnerable population

18.

ECRs usually refer to

PhD students, postdoctoral fellows and scientists who have 10 years or less of experience
after the doctoral degree, although there is some flexibility in this definition

19.

Due to their

career stage, ECRs often face job precarity, lack of available opportunities, low funding, and

job insecurity

20

(e.g., untenured positions and temporary contract employees). These

problems are augmented by the COVID-19 pandemic and may be experienced more in
countries with a developing scientific system. The impact could be higher for countries that are
developing their research environment, are dependent on training their ECRs and conducting
experiments abroad through international exchanges programs

21,

which have been stopped

due to the pandemic.
Given these unprecedented times, it has been observed that international scientific
organizations,

stakeholders

have

We, as ECRs, strongly

believe that science diplomacy can make a difference in addressing the challenges (emanated
or amplified by the current pandemic) that ECRs would face inside and outside academia.
Here we present such challenges, and discuss how the Global Young Academy (GYA), an
independent organization of early to mid-career researchers across all disciplines and
countries, has provided a platform for ECRs to practice science diplomacy, science advice,
and science communication. The former by serving as a bridge between ECRs and
governments, the second by hearing the voices of young researchers when enacting policies,
and the latter by informing societies about the benefits of scientific research. Motivated by the
described examples, we recommend measures for scientists, funding agencies, and
international organizations to foster international collaboration in these unparallel times.

Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on science and early career researchers
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected science globally at multiple levels and scales
Scientific fields directly related to the pandemic response

24

23.

received special attention at the

national, regional, and global levels in terms of funding priorities, continuity of in-person
activities during movement restrictions, as well as public awareness about their relevance to
the society. The urgency of the pandemic response prompted the creation of international
collaborations (e.g., diagnosis, vaccines and therapeutics development, viral genome
sequencing, and clinical trials) all supported with quick calls for special funding opportunities.
Another collateral but unexpected effect of the pandemic are enhanced virtual interactions
observed across disciplines. Conferences, workshops, and seminars that moved to digital
formats often became more inclusive and enabled scientists to potentially reach broader

audiences. International academic mobility and scientific exchange are commonly threatened
by limited travel budget and visa-related issues

25,

then virtual meetings addressed

inclusiveness concerns, especially for ECRs from low and middle-income countries.
Nevertheless, the lack of in-person interactions may not allow sufficient networking
opportunities for the initiation of collaborations, or career opportunities for ECRs, specially
outside their countries, often a scientific training step for ECRs from developing countries
28.

26 27

The positive and negative effects of virtual engagement have been discussed, including

inequities in technology access and personal issues associated with telecommuting

29.

Closures of laboratories, quarantines in many countries, and concomitant travel
restrictions stalled progress in research other than COVID-19-related, reasons for many
scientists to not attend conferences planned before the pandemic was declared, reducing
chances for engaging with other researchers. Additionally, researchers in general need to
secure funding, which usually depends on the progress of ongoing research. The issues
inherent to the pandemic contingency may not provide the conditions to advance research for
securing future funding. This has a higher effect on ECRs whose salaries generally depend
directly on their grants or fellowships

30 31.

This scenario could be improved if researchers

create new partnerships, especially between countries with different management of the
COVID-19 contingency, or that are at different stages of the pandemic. Thus, research tasks
could be shared and complemented if performed in different locations or sharing facilities
where the contingency allows in-person work, as part of a collaboration with researchers
where research is stalled, allowing for continuity.
The issues affecting ECRs working in disciplines not directly related to the pandemic
response, also worsened the plight of some subgroups, particularly postdoctoral researchers
and those finishing their PhDs, impacting career plans, expiration of fellowships, and wellbeing
32 33 34 35.

Due to the reduction in research funding, there could be an effect on employment

and contract-research workers, a common scenario for ECRs, making them prone to job
insecurity. ECRs undergo years of extensive training and undoubtedly, they represent one of
the most highly skilled workforces as they continue advancing their careers. The insecurities of
scientific careers may discourage postdoctoral researchers and up-coming generations of
science graduates from adopting scientific research as a lifelong career or even dropping
scientific careers both in academic and private sectors. This may disproportionately affect
women, underrepresented groups, and science-lagging countries

36 37.

Furthermore, these

exchange and engagement programs to support ECRs continue their research in the current
and post-pandemic times.

An academy of early career researchers as science diplomacy actors
The GYA is a worldwide organization of early and mid-career scientists from different
fields of knowledge. It empowers young researchers to lead international, interdisciplinary, and
intergenerational dialogues to create an impact on science and society. GYA has served as a
supportive institution promoting the foundation of novel National Young Academies (NYAs)
worldwide

38.

In doing so, members of these academies have engaged in debates that served

to modulate the pace of diplomatic efforts of their countries from a scientific realm. NYAs have
promoted science advice at the national level and science diplomacy and scientific
collaboration at the regional level and worldwide, many times with GYA participation 39.
The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. To
support the pandemic response, on March 26, the GYA released the statement “Beyond
Boundaries: A global message from young scientists on COVID-19”, with recommendations to
strengthen international partnerships, as well as to formulate harmonized international
scientific policies toward the mitigation of the pandemic effects

40.

On the axis Science in

Diplomacy, as part of the G7 group of academies, GYA is able to integrate the voices of ECRs
with the advocacy of diplomatic groups; as seen with the release of the statement “The critical
need for international cooperation during Covid-19 pandemic joint statement of Academies of
Sciences and Medicine”

41.

Also, in 2020, the group of G20 Science Academies (S20), created

the statement on “Foresight: Science for Navigating Critical Transitions,”

42

with participation of

GYA members. This communique directly reported to policy-makers and/or governments of
G20 countries.
The initial months of the pandemic highlighted the need of inclusive science
communication that helps inform and show the population about the need of science
diplomacy and science advice to tackle solutions to the pandemic. The webinar “COVID-19 in

Latin America, perspectives from young scientists” in May 2020, brought together six GYA
scientists to provide 132 attendees from 20 countries with reliable and accurate information on
the pandemic 43.
The transition to online interactions created more inclusive settings by eliminating travelassociated logistics and monetary factors as limitations. Often, travel expenses for in-person
meetings of academies may not be allocated from research grants or fellowships as they are
considered service, hindering participation. The first GYA e-AGM and e-conference (June
2020), combined real-time interactive and asynchronous events, and discussions with prerecorded presentations. This was the year with the highest attendance, despite encompassing
attendees challenged by the differences in time zones. But the digital divide, which existed
before the pandemic, has surfaced more than ever now that most events are virtual. One
aspect is suboptimal or lack of suitable technology in some regions -a major challenge for
synchronic engagement. A practical measure to enable equal opportunities for synchronous
interactions is to subsidize internet access for participants in a specific event as fees might be
prohibitory in some countries

44.

The e-events offered new, experimental ways of engagement

for GYA members, representatives of NYAs, renowned scientists, professionals in science
policy, along with key partner organizations 45.
Another aspect of the digital divide is the paywall to access scientific literature and
publication fees, which may be aggravated by reduced funding

46.

In fact, it might be worse

during the pandemic in institutions with no remote access to their digital library during closures.
Interestingly, most of COVID-19-related research has been made open access, evidencing the
urgency to advocate for open access for all other disciplines, a trend that must be promoted
and expanded. The GYA advocates for open science through partnering with UNESCO and
other key stakeholders in a wide range of initiatives 47.
The GYA and NYAs work together to increase scientific collaborations in different
regions and suggest solutions from ECRs to address globally important issues. The global
meeting of NYAs, the largest gathering

48

of young academies so far (and first-ever online)

organized by GYA in September 2020, represented a global platform for establishing further
collaborations and exchange of best practices. From a science diplomacy perspective, it
allowed exchanging ideas between ECRs with different decision-making capabilities within
academic, private, and governmental sectors. This meeting served for gathering Latin

American and Caribbean fellows involved in the writing of a current assessment on the
situation of early- and mid-career scholars in this region

49.

A recent GYA-funded report

presented a regional assessment on future research perspectives of ECRs from South East
Asia

50.

Some major trends were reported: limited intraregional scientific collaboration and

mobility, disparities in scientific practices between countries, and lack of proper availability of
resources for scientific research.
The GYA’s North-South interdisciplinary grants
Program (YSAP)

52

51

and the Young Scientist Ambassador

are two concrete examples of sustained opportunities that are the direct

outcome of interactions created as part of the membership to GYA. These annual projects
create deliverables that enable further joint projects

53.

The nature of these programs is to

connect researchers across countries that do not traditionally engage through science. A key
inclusive factor, since cultural or regional conditions may represent biases that forbid
researchers from establishing novel partnerships. These collaborations may also involve
outreach programs and interactions with stakeholders (e.g., media, policy-makers), increasing
the impact and fostering science diplomacy through scientific collaboration

54.

In 2020, the

bilateral YSAP missions were modified to a virtual format, time will determine if their impact is
similar to the in-person format

55.

The North-South grant aims to foster global collaboration

within the GYA. For 2020/21, it was awarded to members from six countries, who aim to
collect, and analyze the artwork of life during the COVID-19 pandemic across the world in
relation to the measured intensity of the pandemic 56.
To suggest tailored solutions, further effects of the pandemic on ECRs must be
assessed. Members of the GYA Women in Science working group compiled experiences
amongst members, women scientists from different countries, as they tried to navigate their
work and motherhood. They shared pieces of advice and motivation in the article “GYA
Women in Science stay and work from home: How might we make COVID-19 lockdown work
for us?“

57.

This exploratory perspective was applied to other projects, like the inclusion of

COVID-19-related questions in different surveys, such as the impact of the pandemic in
women in science’s work, or on ECRs from a specific region through the Global State of Young
Scientists in Latin America and the Caribbean study (GLoSYS LAC). To understand the role of
science and ECRs in the current pandemic, other GYA surveys about trust in medical science
or young scientists’ perception on science advice were updated as well. The results of these

studies will be presented to policy-makers and are expected to be used to improve the
environment in which ECRs develop their missions.
Capacity building for global partnerships is crucial all the time, but even more necessary
in these times that science needs collaborative young leaders with science communication,
advice and diplomacy skills. The Science Leadership Programs (SLPs) implemented by GYA
in Africa and Asia, are tools that could be adapted for current specific needs and be expanded
to other regions. Additionally, a specific space to harness science diplomacy skills of ECRs in
South Asia was developed as a virtual workshop 58.

Recommendations to support early career researchers affected by the pandemic
A global perspective on the issues emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic contingency
and impact on ECRs have been presented. There is a need to develop strategies to boost
scientific diplomacy to solve these challenges. Relevant GYA activities have been introduced,
constituting experiences on how international associations can foster partnerships to enable
science diplomacy to act proactively. Similarly, the support of the recommendations listed
below might be useful and considered as intersectional issues that can be developed in future
science diplomacy engagements. Based on this, relevant recommendations are proposed and
can be extrapolated in other settings, for scientists and policy-makers to employ science
diplomacy tools to address and overcome these urgent issues.

The effect of telecommuting with young children at home is only one example of how

COVID-19 pandemic has widened gender disparities for women scientists, for senior
researchers and more vulnerable ECRs alike. V. Gewin, The career cost of COVID-19 to

With the support and/or communication with the GYA, NYAs were established in different

regions, such as Bangladesh, Hungary, and D.R. Congo. For example, the new D. R. Congo
Young Academy of Sciences (DRC-YAS) was supported by the GYA in conjunction with other
established African NYAs https://globalyoungacademy.net/congo-young-academy-of-scienceslaunched/

This statement provides recommendations on how we navigate the crisis and transition, as a

global catastrophe can affect multiple aspects of our lives, such as economies, health and
social security systems, access to digital technologies and capacities to respond with robust
scientific knowledge to guide national, regional, and global policies, see

Such report is planned to be distributed to various stakeholders in this region with different

degrees of decision-making competences. For the ASEAN region, a similar report has been
already produced and distributed to different stakeholders See: J. Geffers, C. Beaudry, H-C.

Both programs (North-South grants and YSAP) have allowed to develop further projects,

involving publications, graduate student co-supervision and organization of further events,
such as conferences. https://globalyoungacademy.net/activities/connecting-epigenetics-andnatural-resources/, https://globalyoungacademy.net/wpcontent/uploads/2017/09/YSAP_Mission-Report_-Ghada.pdf,

54

For example, YSAP 2019 mission of climate change and SDGs between Chile and Morocco,

included meetings with the respective embassies, outreach in universities, collaborative
research and organization of conferences.

As this is a recent program, anecdotal data support the contention that this endeavor set out

networks that are currently, - and likely in the future - producing research outputs in the form of
reports and peer-reviewed publications.

The Science Diplomacy in South Asia workshop had participants from 7/8 South Asian

countries. Remarkably, not only in this event but in the organizing working group India and
Pakistan are represented, stressing the need and willingness of science in/for diplomacy
between countries with recent and current political tensions.
