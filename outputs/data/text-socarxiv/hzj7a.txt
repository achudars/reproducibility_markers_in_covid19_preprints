Abstract
To what degree does social distancing have a causal effect on the spread of SARS-CoV2? To generate causal evidence, we show that week to week changes in weather conditions
provided a natural experiment that altered daily travel and movement outside the home, and thus
affected social distancing in the first several weeks when Covid-19 began to spread in many U.S.
counties. Using aggregated mobile phone location data and leveraging changes in social
distancing driven by weekly weather conditions, we provide the first causal evidence on the
effect of social distancing on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Results show that a 1 percent increase
in distance traveled leads to an 8.1 percent increase in new cases per capita in the following
week, and a 1 percent increase in non-essential visits leads to a 6.9 percent increase in new cases
per capita in the following week. Results are stronger in densely populated counties and close to
zero in less densely populated counties.

The Causal Effect of Social Distancing on the Spread of SARS-CoV-2

In the absence of a vaccine or therapeutic treatment, social distancing has become the
primary non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) to control the spread of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Cities, counties and states in the United States have
adopted a range of efforts designed to limit travel, large groups, and face-to-face interaction in
schools, workplaces, business establishments, and public spaces.
The staggering scale of behavioral change is unprecedented in modern American history.
Considering the economic and social costs of social distancing and the disruption to everyday
life, it is crucial to generate rigorous, causal evidence assessing the effect of social distancing in
limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Existing evidence comes from well-established
epidemiological models of infection1-4 and innovative observational evidence from historical
pandemics.5-9 However, we are aware of no research that relies on data from this pandemic and
provides convincing causal evidence on a basic yet essential question: To what degree does
social distancing have a causal effect on the spread of SARS-CoV-2?
This study develops a method designed to generate causal evidence to estimate the
impact of social distancing on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We draw on mobile phone location
data to measure changes in total distance traveled and visits to non-essential establishments
within counties, which we merge with county-level information on confirmed cases of SARSCoV-2.
Simply documenting the association between changes in social distancing and the spread
of SARS-CoV-2 will generate biased results because the greatest changes in behavior have taken
place in the areas hit hardest by the virus, leading to a spurious positive association between

distancing and growth in SARS-CoV-2. To generate causal evidence we rely on an exogenous
source of variation in social distancing: daily weather conditions. We show that week to week
changes in precipitation provided a natural experiment that altered daily travel and movement
outside the home, and thus affected social distancing in the early weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak
in the U.S. By leveraging changes in social distancing driven by weekly precipitation, this
method allows us to identify the causal effect of social distancing on the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Data and Methods
We combine data sources on confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2, social distancing, weather
conditions, and population characteristics in U.S. counties. Due to inconsistencies in data
sources, we include only the contiguous 48 states.
SARS-CoV-2 cases. We measure growth in confirmed cases using data from the
Coronavirus Resource Center run by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at
Johns Hopkins University.10 Data from U.S. counties run from January 22 through April 23,
2020. The resource center defines confirmed cases to include presumptive positive cases and
probable cases, consistent with guidelines established by the CDC. We include all measures of
confirmed cases with a county identifier.
Social distancing. Data on social distancing were provided by Unacast at the level of U.S.
counties. Unacast analyzes human mobility through location data available via mobile phones.
The dataset begins on February 4 and runs through April 23, 2020. All measures of social
distancing capture change in movement relative to a baseline period covering the four weeks
prior to March 8, 2020. The dataset is based on 15 to 17 million unique “identifiers” per day,
aggregated to the level of US counties.

We use two measures of social distancing. First, change in the average distance traveled
per user, measured as the percentage change relative to the baseline period. Second, change in
visitation to non-essential venues, including (but not limited to) restaurants, department and
clothing stores, jewelers, consumer electronics stores, office supply stores, spas and hair salons,
fitness centers, car dealerships, hotels, craft and hobby shops. Change in non-essential visits is
also measured as the percentage change relative to the baseline period. Weekly measures used in
all models represent the average change in distance traveled and the average change in nonessential visits, respectively, over the calendar week. Aggregating by week is important because
of substantial day of the week effects on social distancing. By averaging over a full calendar
week we eliminate any variation due to the specific days of the week in which distancing is
measured.
Weather. Daily precipitation, relative humidity, and temperature data were obtained from
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for
Environmental Prediction. Precipitation (mm) is measured at 0.25 resolution (0.25 degree
longitude by 0.25 degree latitude) across the contiguous United States. Our main analyses use a
dichotomous measure of any precipitation in a given day rather than total amount of
precipitation—results are the same using either measure. Relative humidity (%) is measured at
2.5 resolution and temperature (C) at 0.25 resolution. We rasterized the weather data into cells
and calculated the total precipitation, mean relative humidity, and maximum temperature per day
within each county. As with all variables, each measure is averaged over calendar weeks.
Precipitation thus represents the percentage of days in the week with any precipitation, high
temperature and relative humidity measure the average high temperature and average level of
relative humidity over the week.

Empirical strategy
Our analysis builds on a common approach to modeling growth in infectious diseases
within areas through the use of time series methods that adjust for contagion and autocorrelation
across time periods.11,12 However, we adapt these approaches to generate causal evidence on the
impact of social distancing.
Identifying the causal effect of social distancing on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is
challenging for two reasons. First, counties where residents make more substantial changes to
their daily patterns of movement in response to the pandemic likely differ in unobserved ways
from counties where residents make less dramatic changes. For this reason, analyses comparing
counties with more or less social distancing will generate biased estimates even when matching
or controlling for observable characteristics of counties.
A second problem is that changes in behavior are driven, in part, by the spread of the
virus. In the language of causal inference, social distancing is endogenous. This means that
residents in areas where the virus is spreading more rapidly are more likely to make more
substantial changes in behavior, leading to a spurious positive association between social
distancing and the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
To deal with both of these challenges we carry out an analysis of change within counties
using county fixed effects, and we exploit an exogenous source of variation in social distancing
arising from weather patterns.13,14 We utilize two stage least squares (2SLS) to carry out the
analysis, with precipitation and temperature over a given week used as an instrumental variable
that creates exogenous variation in social distancing in the same week. 15,16 Further, we control

for the existing cases in the county, for relative humidity and for time trends. eFigure 1 in the
supplement to the article describes the logic of the analysis in a causal diagram.
The analysis is represented with the following system of equations.

(1) 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑐,𝑡−1 = 𝛼 + 𝑅𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑐,𝑡−1 + 𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑐,𝑡−1 + 𝐻𝑢𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑐,𝑡−1 + 𝐶𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠𝑐,𝑡−1 +
𝐶𝑐 + 𝑊𝑒𝑒𝑘𝑡 + 𝜂𝑐𝑡
(2) 𝐶𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠𝑐𝑡

= 𝛼 + 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑐,𝑡−1 + 𝐻𝑢𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑐,𝑡−1 + 𝐶𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠𝑐,𝑡−1 + 𝐶𝑐 + 𝑊𝑒𝑒𝑘𝑡 +

𝑒𝑐𝑡

In Equation 1, 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑐𝑡 is the measure of social distancing in county c in week t-1, the
week prior to the measurement of the outcome; 𝑅𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑐,𝑡−1 represents precipitation, measured as
the percentage of days in the prior week (t-1) with any precipitation in county c;
𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑐,𝑡−1 represents the high temperature, measured as the average high temperature in the
prior week (t-1) in county c. Rainfall and temperature are used as instruments that generate
exogenous variation in social distancing in week t-1. 𝐻𝑢𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑐,𝑡−1 represents the relative
humidity, measured as the average in the prior week (t-1) in county c and used as a control
variable; 𝐶𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠𝑐,𝑡−1 represents the natural log of the number of existing cases in the county in
the prior week (t-1) per capita in county c; 𝐶𝑐 is a vector of dummy indicators for each county;
𝑊𝑒𝑒𝑘𝑡 is a vector of dummy indicators for the calendar week; and 𝜂𝑐𝑡 is an idiosyncratic error
term for county c and calendar week t.
To identify the effect of social distancing in week t-1 on new cases in week t we estimate
Equation 2 using two stage least squares, where social distancing is instrumented with
precipitation and temperature. The outcome, growth in confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2, is

measured as the natural log of new cases per capita, in week t. We estimated standard county
fixed effects and first difference models, both of which effectively deal with unobserved, timeinvariant aspects of counties. In models shown in the text we use first differences because they
are more efficient and align with the model of contagion more intuitively. We use population
weights to improve the precision of the estimates. All estimates adjust for heteroskedasticity, for
autocorrelation, and for other forms of clustering of residuals within counties.
Two central assumptions must be met in order to interpret the coefficient from the 2SLS
estimate as causal. First, weather conditions must induce a change in social distancing behavior.
To check this assumption, we report results from Equation 1 and demonstrate the strong
relationship between weather conditions and the two measures of social distancing.
Second, there must be no other pathway by which the instrumental variable (weather
conditions) affects the outcome of interest (new cases of SARS-CoV-2) other than through its
effect on social distancing. This is referred to as the exclusion restriction (Fig. S1). In our case,
one concern is that precipitation and temperature are associated with other weather conditions,
most notably relative humidity, that may directly affect the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the available evidence on the relationship between humidity and the spread of this
virus is mixed and uncertain,17-19 it is nonetheless important to address this possibility directly.
To do so we control for relative humidity in the same week as precipitation, eliminating this
pathway from our instrumental variable to the outcome. As we demonstrate, controlling for
humidity has no impact on our results.

Results

The sample consists of 788 US counties observed over four weeks, beginning in the first
week in which the particular county reported at least 10 confirmed cases and continuing for the
subsequent three weeks. Counties were included in the sample if they reported at least 10
confirmed cases by March 31, 2020, which enables us to measure growth in confirmed cases for
at least three weeks following the tenth case. By construction, the sample is composed of larger
counties where SARS-CoV-2 appeared relatively early in March 2020 (Table 1).
We estimate the effect of social distancing in a given week on growth in confirmed cases
in the following week. As noted previously, the central challenge in identifying the effect of
distancing on new cases is that distancing is endogenous to the spread of the virus. For this
reason, a basic regression analysis with a cross-section of counties would show that counties
with greater social distancing have more confirmed cases, a spurious relationship. Even
considering change within counties over time, a naïve analysis would conclude that distancing
has no effect on the growth of confirmed cases. This conclusion is incorrect and is driven by the
fact that distancing behavior is changing the most in places where the virus is spreading fastest.

To deal with this problem we exploit an exogenous source of variation in distancing behavior
arising from daily weather conditions. In the first stage of the model, we use precipitation and
average high temperature in the given week to predict social distancing in the same week, while
controlling for the log of existing cases per capita, relative humidity and the calendar week of the
year (Table 2).
We find that a change from no precipitation over the week to precipitation every day of
the week leads to a 1.9 percent reduction in distance traveled (b = -1.918, 95% CI -3.458 to .377, p=.015), and a 1 degree increase in average high temperature leads to a .22 percent increase

in distance traveled (b=.215, 95% CI .086 to .345, p=.001). Because data on non-essential visits
is not available for 21 counties, results from the model using non-essential visits as the measure
of social distancing are slightly different. In this model, precipitation is not strongly related to
non-essential visits, but a one degree increase in average high temperature leads to a .32 percent
increase in non-essential visits (b = .315, 95% CI .165 to .464, p <.001). Tests for “weak
instruments” typically consider an F-statistic below 10 to indicate a weak instrument.20 The Fstatistic from the first stage is over 10 in both models, indicating that precipitation is strongly
linked with social distancing behavior.
Results presented so far indicate that weather conditions generate substantial changes in
social distancing. Our main interest is in using this source of exogenous variation driven by
weather patterns to identify the effect of social distancing on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (Table
3). We find that a 1 percent increase in distance traveled leads to an 8.1 percent increase in new
cases per capita (b = .078, exp(b)=1.081, 95% CI .019 to .116, p=.005) in the following week
(Table 3, top panel). Results focusing on non-essential visits show that a 1 percent increase in
non-essential visits leads to a 6.9 percent increase in new cases per capita (b = .067,
exp(b)=1.069, 95% CI .019 to .116, p = .006) in the following week (Table 3, bottom panel).
We carried out an additional analysis to assess whether the effect of social distancing
varies depending on population density. We split the counties in our sample by the median
population density and ran the same models shown previously. We find that precipitation is an
equally strong predictor of social distancing in more and less densely populated counties within
our sample (Table S1 and Table S2).
Second stage results focusing on distance traveled show no effect of social distancing in
counties that are less densely populated (b = -.021, 95% CI -.072 to .029, p = .411) (Table S1). In

more densely populated counties, we find an extremely strong effect. A one percent increase in
distance traveled leads to a 10 percent increase in new cases per capita in the following week (b
= .095, exp(b)=1.100, 95% CI .029 to .160, p = .004) (Table S2). In results not shown we find
the same pattern using non-essential visits as the measure of social distancing.

Discussion
Existing evidence in support of social distancing as the primary non-pharmaceutical
response to SARS-CoV-2 comes from sophisticated epidemiological models that rely on
assumptions about the degree to which social distancing reduces interpersonal contact and
infection, and from innovative observational studies of historical pandemics. No research that we
are aware of provides direct empirical evidence identifying the causal effect of social distancing
behavior on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We draw on newly available mobile phone data and a
method exploiting exogenous variation in distancing behavior within counties to generate such
evidence.
We find that increasing distance traveled by 1 percent leads to an 8.1 percent increase in
confirmed cases per capita in the following week. Similarly, increasing non-essential visits by 1
percent leads to a 6.9 percent increase in confirmed cases per capita in the following week. The
findings are large in magnitude and robust to various adjustments to the model specification.
It is important to note that our results are limited in several ways. First, because we draw
on data from counties where SARS-CoV-2 appeared relatively early, results are most applicable
to larger and more densely populated counties. We found that the estimated effects are
particularly large in counties with high population density within our sample, and were close to
zero in less densely populated counties. Second, we are unable to distinguish between the effects

of particular NPIs designed to generate social distancing and limit movement and interaction.
Our results do not point to specific measures as being most effective, but rather indicate that any
NPI that limits travel and non-essential visits will likely be effective in reducing the spread of
SARS-CoV-2. Third, the analysis does not consider the costs of social distancing. Any decisions
about NPIs must balance the benefits of reducing the spread of the virus with the costs associated
with the intervention.
With those limitations in mind, the findings do provide strong support for efforts to
control SARS-CoV-2 through policies intended to reduce non-essential travel and visits to nonessential establishments. Such policies have been justified by results from formal modeling
exercises and by the experience of cities during the 1918 influenza pandemic. This study shows
that the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions focusing on reducing movement and
interventions is bolstered with causal evidence from the early period of the current pandemic.

Sample and robustness. Results are robust to several minor changes in the model that we
document here. First, in alternative models we use only precipitation to instrument for social
distancing, with no substantive differences in results. Second, alternative models did not include
the lagged measure of existing cases. Again, findings are not sensitive to this change. Third, we
run alternative models that exclude weeks where there were 0 new cases or a decline in cases,
resulting in negative growth. Because we use the natural log of new cases as our outcome
measure, we assigned a value of 1 case in this scenario in order to avoid missing data. If we
instead treat these as missing, results do not change.

Causal diagram (Figure S1). Our aim is to estimate the effect of distancing behavior within
county c in the previous week t-1 on the number of cases in county c in week t. By focusing on
within-county differences in distancing over time, we ensure that unobserved differences
between counties do not bias the estimated effect. However, the extent of distancing behavior
within a county is likely to increase contemporaneously with the frequency of recorded cases,
leading to a spurious positive association between distancing and cases (represented by the
dotted line connecting cases at t-1 to distancing at t-1).
To identify the effect of distancing, we require an exogenous source of variation in
distancing behavior in week t-1. Furthermore, this source of variation—or instrument—must
only influence the frequency of cases in week t through its effect on distancing during t-1. We
use weather conditions (labeled “precipitation” in the diagram) in week t-1 as the instrument, and
show that weather conditions in week t-1 affect social distancing in the same week. However,

one concern is that precipitation is associated with humidity, which may itself be related to the
spread of SARS-CoV-2, thereby opening a “backdoor path” between precipitation and new cases
in week t. To account for this pathway and ensure that precipitation is a valid instrument, our
model conditions on relative humidity.
