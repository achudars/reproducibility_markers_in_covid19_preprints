COVID-19 BEREAVEMENT AND DEPRESSION
Abstract
Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has left older adults around the world bereaved by the
sudden death of relatives and friends. We examine if COVID-19 bereavement corresponds with
older adults’ reporting depression in 27 countries, and test for variation by gender and country
context.
Methods: We analyze SHARE COVID-19 data collected between June-August 2020 from
N=51,383 older adults (age 50–104) living in 27 countries, of whom 1,363 reported the death of
a relative or friend from COVID-19. We estimate pooled-multilevel logit regression models to
examine if COVID-19 bereavement was associated with self-reported depression and worsening
depression, and we test whether national COVID-19 mortality rates moderate these assocations.
Results: COVID-19 bereavement is associated with significantly higher probabilities of both
reporting depression and reporting worsened depression among older adults. Net of one’s own
personal loss, living in a country with the highest COVID-19 mortality rate is associated with
women’s reports of worsened depression but not men’s. However, the country’s COVID-19
mortality rate does not moderate associations between COVID-19 bereavement and depression.
Discussion: COVID-19 deaths have lingering mental health implications for surviving older
adults. Even as the collective toll of the crisis is apparent, bereaved older adults are in particular
need of mental health support.

COVID-19 BEREAVEMENT AND DEPRESSION
Background
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a mortality shock of historic proportion, responsible
for more than 2.5 million deaths worldwide in a single year (Johns Hopkins, n.d.). Bereavement
is the loss of a person or thing that was valued (Corr et al., 2000). Each COVID-19 death leaves
behind numerous others bereaved: the unprecedented rise in mortality during the pandemic has
produced a corresponding rise in those coping with the loss of loved ones, especially among
older adults. For instance, estimates from the U.S. suggest that each COVID-19 death results in
an average of nine close relatives bereaved and that older adults are the most likely age group to
experience the loss of a parent, child, sibling, or spouse (Verdery et al., 2020). The tendency for
individuals to socialize with others of similar ages (McPherson et al., 2001), combined with the
concentration of COVID-19 deaths among older adults, also means that this age group is most at
risk of experiencing the death of friends from this disease.
Stroebe et al. (2006) provide an integrative risk factor framework to understand
bereavement adjustments and outcomes. This framework posits that various stressors stemming
from bereavement correspond with a range of poor health outcomes, from mental health
problems to elevated mortality risk (Elwert & Christakis, 2008a, 2008b; Stroebe et al., 2007). In
the short term, the health challenges associated with bereavement can manifest as mental health
problems, which often foreshadow physical health declines (Domingue et al., 2020). Research
highlights adverse consequences of COVID-19 mitigation strategies (quarantine, social
distancing) for older adults’ mental health (Czeisler et al., 2021; Pfefferbaum & North, 2020;
Simon et al., 2020), while related work draws attention to COVID-19 bereavement among older
adults (Carr et al., 2020; Stroebe & Schut, 2021). However, we lack population-based evidence
that COVID-19 bereavement is associated with adverse mental health, especially for older adults.

COVID-19 BEREAVEMENT AND DEPRESSION
COVID-19 fatalities commonly involve physical discomfort, unexpectedness, medical
interventions, and isolation at the time of death (Carr et al., 2020) – all factors that could make
bereavement more difficult for those left behind (Krikorian et al., 2020). The knowledge that
one’s friend or relative suffered, or the inability to say goodbye, may leave the bereaved from
COVID-19 especially vulnerable to poor mental health (Carr et al., 2020). We first we use
survey data collected from older adults in 27 countries during the initial height of the crisis
(June-August 2020) to provide population-based evidence of the national prevalence of older
adult bereavement in the face of COVID-19 (Research Question 1). The emotional turmoil
associated with bereavement could be heightened in the midst of the pandemic, a time when the
social fabric has been weakened. Thus, we analyze these survey data to test for associations
between COVID-19 bereavement and self-reports of depression, paying mind to potential
variation across types of bereavement (non-family versus family bereavement; Research
Question 2).
Theoretical models in sociology and disaster response offer a second theoretical
framework to understand the mental health toll of national crises (Barton, 1969; Collins, 2004),
but its theoretical propositions offer a mix of expectations about how national COVID-19
severity might independently associate with mental health or else moderate individual
bereavement and mental health associations. We leverage the cross-national nature of the data to
examine these ideas. Even as the COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis, its national severity has
varied dramatically. In countries with severe epidemics, older adults may suffer from poor
mental health more generally—even absent firsthand bereavement (Shultz et al., 2015; Wang et
al., 2021). That is, the collective nature of the crisis could lead to worse health for the majority of
older adults, not just those personally bereaved. Living in a country with a higher COVID-19

4

COVID-19 BEREAVEMENT AND DEPRESSION
mortality rate could worsen mental health among older adults due to their greater risk
perceptions or fear, or their having to more dramatically alter their day-to-day lives in response
to personal virus avoidance strategies or government mandates.
Beyond a potential direct impact, the collective toll and personal experiences of COVID19 mortality could combine to be especially challenging for older adults. Navigating a personal
loss may be particularly taxing where COVID-19 is more severe and the death toll higher, and
thus suffering is palpable, daily routines more severely disrupted, and fear runs especially high.
The reverse may also be true, however, as sociological theories speculate that communal
tragedies (wars, terrorist attacks, and pandemics) can spur social solidarity, providing resilience
to those experiencing the tragedy most acutely (Barton, 1969; Collins, 2004). In light of these
arguments, we examine the role of country-level COVID-19 mortality rates (proxying national
crisis severity) as independent correlates or moderators of the association between personal
COVID-19 bereavement and mental health among older adults (Researcch Question 3).
Experience and reactions to bereavement could also be highly-gendered. Among older
adults, women are likely at elevated risk of COVID-19 bereavement relative to men, both
because of higher spousal loss due to men’s higher mortality from COVID-19 (Guilmoto, 2020)
and higher friend loss given women tend to have larger social networks (Cornwell et al., 2008).
Recent reports find women spend more time worrying, thinking, and talking about COVID-19
than men (Barber & Kim, 2020), and generally have had worse mental health during the
pandemic (Pierce et al., 2020). Thus, we investigate potential gender differences in COVID-19
bereavement and mental health among older adults (Research Question 4).
Methods
Data

5

COVID-19 BEREAVEMENT AND DEPRESSION
We use data from the long-running Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe
(SHARE) COVID-19 survey (Börsch-Supan, 2020). Since 2004, SHARE has collected data on
older adults’ health and wellbeing, demographic characteristics, and family and social networks.
The panel study sample is refreshed with new respondents at each wave, producing nationally
representative samples of individuals age 50 and older in each country.
The COVID-19 crisis hit during regular SHARE data collection, forcing in-person
interviews to a halt. At the time, approximately 30% of the panel sample and 50% of the
refresher sample interviews were outstanding. To respond, survey administrators pivoted their
efforts to collect time-sensitive data about the crisis among the uninterviewed Wave 8
participants (see http://www.share-project.org/special-data-sets/share-covid-19questionnaire.html). The SHARE COVID-19 survey was administered over the phone between
June and August 2020. In addition to a condensed version of the standard SHARE questionnaire,
respondents answered questions about life events and changes during the pandemic. Of the
52,310 SHARE-COVID respondents, we have valid, non-missing data on 51,383 (98.23%)
respondents from 27 countries, who comprise our final analytic sample (see Supplementary
Table 1 for descriptive information).
Measures
Self-reports of depression. Respondents were asked yes or no to the question “in the last
month, have you been sad or depressed”; this question is one item from the EURO-depression
scale, the only depression item admininstered in the SHARE COVID-19 survey (Guerra et al.,
2015; Prince et al., 1999). For those indicating yes to this question, they were further asked to
compare their depression to pre-pandemic status. We generate two binary measures: 1) current
depression (1 = reporting sad or depressed in the last month); 2) worsening depression (1 =

6

COVID-19 BEREAVEMENT AND DEPRESSION
reporting sad or depressed in the last month and feeling more sad or depressed relative to prepandemic)1.
COVID-19 bereavement. Respondents report whether anyone close to them died of an
infection from SARS-COV2, and if so, their relationship to the deceased. With this information,
we generate three binary measures: 1) any bereavement; 2) any family bereavement (spouse,
parents, children, household members, and other relatives); 3) any non-family bereavement
(friends, caregivers, and others).
Country-level mortality. For each of the 27 countries, we use World Health
Organization data on (1) total COVID-19 deaths and (2) total population size to measure
COVID-19 mortality rates during the study period, specifically up to August 31st, 2020 to
account for potential reporting delays (WHO, 2020). We group these rates into quartiles,
allowing us to capture potential non-linearity. We also control for each country’s all cause prepandemic mortality rate using the most recently available 2018 data for Europe (European Union
Statistical Office, n.d.) and 2016 data for Israel (Ministry of Health Israel, 2016).
Individual controls. We control for key sociodemographic characteristics, including
respondents’ age, gender, partnership status, number of household members, employment status
and self-rated health (pre-pandemic status), and number of chronic conditions (hip fracture,
diabetes, hypertension, heart attack, chronic lung diseases, cancer, and other major illness).
Analytic Strategy
First, we describe country-specific prevalence of COVID-19 mortality and bereavement
across countries, which we contextualize against baseline mortality rates from pre-COVID years.
We use SHARE person-level weights in our estimates of bereavement prevalence. To examine
associations between individual COVID-19 bereavement, country-level COVID-19 mortality,

7

COVID-19 BEREAVEMENT AND DEPRESSION
and reports of depression, we pool 27 countries to estimate multilevel logit regression models
(Snijders & Bosker, 2012) that account for individuals’ nesting within countries.
Results
Table 1 presents estimates of national rates of COVID-19 mortality and COVID-19
bereavement within each focal country as of Summer 2020. COVID-19 mortality rates vary
substantially between countries, reflecting epidemic severity, with some countries having
COVID-19 mortality rates greater than or equal to 50% of baseline mortality (Belgium, Spain,
Sweden, Italy, and France) and others having COVID-19 mortality rates less than 2% of baseline
mortality (Slovakia and Latvia).
On average, a weighted 1.15% and 2.14% of older adults in SHARE countries reported at
least one family and non-family COVID-19 bereavement, respectively. In selected countries over
5% of older adults reported any network COVID-19 bereavement (Belgium, Italy, the
Netherlands, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Sweden). As expected, the countries with the
highest prevalence of COVID-19 bereavement are also the ones with the highest COVID-19
mortality rates. The correlations between country-level COVID-19 mortality rates and any (.86),
family (.86), and non-family (.80) COVID-19 bereavement are uniformly high2.
Panel 1 of Table 2 displays average marginal effects (AME) from multilevel logit models
of depression. Model 1 shows that on average older adults who had COVID-19 bereavement
were 6 percentage points more likely to report depression than those with no such bereavement,
net of the country mortality and individual controls. Model 2, which disaggregates any COVID19 bereavement into family and non-family bereavement, shows both are associated with higher
probability of reporting depression than no bereavement, with family bereavement having a
slightly larger association (AME = 0.08) than non-family (AME = 0.05); however, this

8

COVID-19 BEREAVEMENT AND DEPRESSION
difference is not statistically significant (χ2(1) = 1.27, p = .26). In supplementary analysis (Model
1 of Supplementary Table 2), we examined if the association between COVID-19 bereavement
and depression varies by gender, and found no significant differences.
As shown in Models 1-2, we found no significant association between the national
COVID-19 mortality rate and reports of depression in the full sample. However, gender-specific
models (Models 3-4) confirm that there is an association among women only. As shown in
Model 3, women living in countries with the highest COVID-19 mortality rates (4th quartile) are
more likely to report current depression than women residing in countries with the lowest
COVID-19 mortality rate. Significant interaction terms between gender and national COVID-19
mortality (Model 1 of Supplementary Table 3) suggest that compared to older men, living in
higher COVID-19 mortality countries indeed has a more negative association for older women.
As shown in Panel 2 of Table 2, COVID-19 bereavement also corresponds with selfreported worsened depression: older adults who experienced any, family, or non-family COVID19 bereavement have higher probabilities of reporting worsening depression than those with no
such bereavement (Models 5-6). Additionally, Models 5-6 highlight the importance of countrylevel COVID-19 mortality conditions in older adults’ trajectory of depression: net of their own
experience of a personal loss, older adults living in countries with higher COVID-19 mortality
rates are more likely to report worsening depression. Disaggregating by gender (Models 7-8)
again confirms this association is only significant among women (Model 2 of Supplementary
Table 3 for interaction results).
Figure 1 shows predicted probabilities to further summarize the key findings. Panel A
shows that non-bereaved men (𝜋̂=0.19; 95% CI=[0.17, 0.21]) have the lowest probability of
reporting current depression, followed by non-bereaved women (𝜋̂=0.24; 95% CI=[0.20, 0.27]),

9

COVID-19 BEREAVEMENT AND DEPRESSION
then bereaved men (𝜋̂=0.31; 95% CI=[0.28, 0.33]), and finally bereaved women (𝜋̂=0.38; 95%
CI=[0.34, 0.42]). Panel B confirms these same patterns for worsening depression. Panel C shows
that, for men, being in countries with different COVID-19 mortality rates is not associated with
variations in current depression. However, there are stark differences for women in addition to a
higher baseline rate: compare women in countries with low, first quartile mortality rates (𝜋̂=0.27;
95% CI=[0.23, 0.32]) to women in those with high, fourth quartile rates (𝜋̂=0.34; 95% CI=[0.28,
0.39]). Panel B offers a comparable but more muted result for worsening depression.
Last, we examine if living in a country with a higher COVID-19 mortality rate not only
directly elevates women’s probability of reporting depression, but also amplifies the
consequence of personal bereavement (Supplementary Tables 4-5). We found no significant
interaction terms between country-level COVID-19 mortality and individual bereavement,
highlighting the independent effect of personal bereavement.
Discussion
These results add to the growing recognition of the mental health consequences of the
COVD-19 pandemic, especially for older women (Pierce et al., 2020). Distinct from past studies
that emphasize adverse influences of lockdowns, social distancing, and school closures on
population mental health, our research directly examines the association between the mortality
crisis and mental health for older adults using population-based data from a wide range of
countries. That older women’s reports of depression are associated with both the collective and
personal toll of COVID-19 mortality emphasizes the need for community-based screening to
identify the adults most in need of intervention in the most severely affected countries. These
results should be interpreted with caution, given that we could not account for other types of
bereavement (such as accidental death) due to data constraints. However, given the bereavement

10

COVID-19 BEREAVEMENT AND DEPRESSION
implications of the worldwide pandemic, the mental health associations we document are quite
concerning.
Even as our study offers the first analysis of cross-national mental health consequences of
COVID-19 bereavement, the results come with limitations. The outcome variables are
retrospective, self-reported measures of any recent or worsening feelings of depression or
sadness; older adults who we code as presenting with self-reported depression may not meet
clinical thresholds. Moreover, although we explore older adults’ self-reports of depression
compared to pre-pandemic status, offering insights into the influence of COVID-19 bereavement
on changes in depression, our cross-sectional, observational design precludes drawing causal
conclusions. Unmeasured counfounding variables may include appraisal and coping styles,
personal personality, family dynamics, religious practice, and cultural background (Stroebe et al.,
2006). The lock-down policy, social welfare system, and other formal support from governments
may also play important roles in older adults’ COVID-19 experience and bereavement reactions.
This study offers a temporally abbreviated view of mental health consequences of
COVID-19 bereavement. There is a reason to suspect that these results foreshadow the
pandemic’s lingering mental health effects. Research shows that depressive symptoms
immediately following bereavement can predict physical health problems down the line
(Domingue et al., 2020). Targeted efforts to address COVID-19 bereavement may especially
benefit older women in countries with severe COVID-19 mortality crises, as well as those
personally affected.

Because many SHARE-COVID respondents are refresher interiews, not panel interviews, we focus

on reported changes rather than controlling for prior wave reports of depressive symptoms. We
conduct a sensitivity check that controlled for prior reports of depression and sociodemographic
characteristics (education and income) among the subset of respondents present in wave 6 survey
and found substantively identical results to what we present here.

These correlations assume that countries with no bereavement reports have 0% bereavement.

Notes: Sorted by COVID-19 mortality rates. National rates of COVID-19 mortality are based on WHO data
(8/31/2020); National rates of baseline mortality are from the statistical office of EU (Eurostat), updated as of
9/10/2020, reporting total deaths in 2018 (except for Israel, 2016 death data from Israel Ministry of Health). Percentages
of respondents experiencing COVID deaths in their overall network, family network, or nonfamily network are
weighted based on SHARE (June-Aug, 2020); we denote estimates where zero respondents reported experiencing such
a death as --. Family deaths include spouses, parents, children, other household members, and relatives. Non-family
deaths include friends, caregivers, and others.
