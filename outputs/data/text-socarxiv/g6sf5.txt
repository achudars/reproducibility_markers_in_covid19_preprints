ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic, which is especially dangerous to older people, has disrupted
the lives of older people and their family caregivers. This commentary outlines the adaptive and
emerging practices in formal supportive services for family caregivers, the changing types of
support that family caregivers are providing to their older relatives, and the ways family
caregivers are seeking informal caregiving support during the COVID-19 outbreak.
Introduction
COVID-19, first diagnosed in Wuhan Province in China in 2019, is especially dangerous
to older people because of age-related health conditions and age-related declines in their immune
systems. Early studies put the mortality rate of COVID-19 for people between ages 70 and
79 years at 8%, and for those over age 80 at 14.8% (Wu & McGoogan, 2020). In the United
States, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Centers for Disease
Control, 2020) estimates that eight out of ten deaths have been among people ages 65 and older.
Older adults living in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes or assisted living facilities,
are at a very high risk for mortality from COVID-19, particularly with asymptomatic or
presymptomatic workers inadvertently spreading the virus in the facilities (McMichael et
al., 2020). While national data were unavailable as of early May 2020, seven states reported
more than half of their COVID-19 deaths were residents of long-term care facilities (Kaiser
Family Foundation, 2020), with some states reporting much higher rates, such as in Minnesota
where about 80% of its deaths were from long-term care facilities (Minnesota Department of
Health, 2020).

In response to older people’s higher chances of complications from COVID-19, the CDC
(Centers for Disease Control, 2020) has recommended older people living in community settings
to stay home as much as possible, and when venturing outside, to practice “social distancing.”
The CDC’s (Centers for Disease Control, 2020) guidance to long-term care facilities urged
facilities to restrict visitors unless visiting a dying relative, screen workers and residents for
symptoms, require workers to wear cloth masks, and limit activities for residents. When longterm care facilities have COVID-19 within their facility, they are advised to separate those with
and without COVID-19 through quarantines and cohorting, which often results in residents being
mostly confined to their rooms. While all of this is challenging for older people living in the
community and long-term facilities, it also can create enormous stress and challenges for their
caregivers. This commentary outlines adaptive and emerging practices in formal supportive
services for caregivers, the changing types of support that family caregivers are providing to
their older relatives, and the ways family caregivers are seeking informal caregiving support
during this global pandemic. Information was obtained from professional and personal
experience, feedback from interactions with over 670 caregivers through a series of webinars copresented by the authors at university and nonprofit venues, and discussions with caregivers in
several online elder caregiving support groups hosted by the authors.
Family caregiving
An estimated 41 million family caregivers1 provide 34 billion hours of care to other
adults in the United States. This care is valued at over 470 USD billion annually (AARP Public
Policy Institute, 2019). Caregiving touches nearly all Americans in some way. Rosalyn Carter is
famously quoted as saying, “There are only four kinds of people in the world. Those who have
been caregivers. Those who are currently caregivers. Those who will be caregivers, and those

who will need a caregiver (Snelling, 2012).” The care provided informally by family can take
many forms, such as providing assistance with activities of daily living or offering social and
emotional support. The care can occur in a variety of settings, including a care receiver’s home,
the caregiver’s home, an assisted living establishment, or a nursing home. Family caregivers
provide, on average, 20 hours per week of care for a period of nearly 5 years, with roughly onethird providing care to more than one older person living in the community (Gaugler &
Kane, 2015). Trends in family caregiving of older people living in the community show declines
as the population ages and successive generations have less children (Stone, 2015), which can
put more responsibility on a smaller number of caregivers, as well as an increased reliance on
formal systems to provide care. With COVID-19, family caregivers of older adults in community
settings are often providing this care from a distance.
Family members also provide care to older relatives living who are living in long-term
care settings, including nursing homes and assisted living facilities. These caregivers spend about
as much time with their relatives as do those caring for those in community settings (Port et
al., 2005). As there are significant staffing shortages in long-term care settings (Geng et
al., 2019), which have been exacerbated by COVID-19 (Mettler et al., 2020), family caregivers
of those living in formal settings might feel extra stress worrying about the care their family
member is receiving and a sense of helplessness at their lack of ability to monitor their care.
Supportive services for caregivers during COVID-19
Crucial to successful caregiving is the utilization of supportive services designed to
decrease burden, stress, depression and burnout (Iecovich, 2008). While studies about caregiving
and COVID-19 are not yet available, it is highly likely that due to a combination of social
distancing, shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders,2 and the disproportionate impact of the virus

on older adults, caregivers of adults living both in community and long-term care are in need of
different types of formal caregiving supports. The following details the emerging changes to
formal supportive services during the COVID-19 crisis.
The 2000 Older Americans Act reauthorization included a provision to support informal
caregivers known as the National Family Caregiver Support Program (Title III-E). The passage
of Title III-E acknowledged the crucial role caregivers play in the lives of older Americans.
Funding through the Older Americans Act flows to states and area agencies on aging, who then
develop relationships with providers in the community to offer direct support to caregivers.
Eligibility for Title III-E mirrors most of the Older Americans Act Titles with some uniqueness.
Services are available to people 18 years and older providing care to someone 60 years and older
or someone of any age with dementia. The program also supports relative caregivers 55 years
and older who are providing care to children or adults with disabilities (Administration for
Community Living, 2019). Also similar to the other Titles, a Title III-E provider cannot charge
for services, but can request either a voluntary contribution or utilize a quasi-sliding fee scale
known as cost-sharing. Services cannot be denied due to a caregiver’s inability or unwillingness
to pay. The CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relieve and Economic Security) Act included an
additional 100 USD million for Title III-E (Administration for Community Living, 2020).
Services available under Title III-E are comprehensive and include coaching and
counseling, support groups, education, respite care, adult day services, and supplemental
services. Supplemental services are services that often target the care receiver, but benefit the
caregiver in some way. For example, a care receiver may need their lawn mowed and the
primary caregiver may not be able to provide this service, but it is crucial in order for the

caregiver to continue to provide care. Another agency could be engaged to offer the lawn
mowing service as a way to support the caregiver so they can continue to provide other care.
The response to COVID-19 has greatly affected the delivery of formal systems and
supports for caregivers. For example, one crucial support for caregivers is adult day services,
where an older adult attends a day program that provides socialization and health related
services. Adult day services provide critical respite for caregivers who may be employed or have
a number of other tasks that need to be accomplished (such as grocery shopping, medical
appointments, caring for young children, etc.). In many states adult day services have been
closed due to stay-at-home orders, such as in Minnesota, where all 225 adult day service
programs were closed, displacing thousands of older adults, many of whom experience cognitive
and memory impairment, who attended adult day programs during the week. Service providers
have needed to innovate quickly and continue to practice nimble, flexible project management to
continue to support caregivers. The following is a case example of how one service provider has
adapted its services to provide caregiving support.
FamilyMeans
Adaptation and innovation in service delivery
FamilyMeans is a nonprofit social services agency in Washington County in Minnesota.
As a recipient of an Older Americans Act Title III-E contract, the organization provides a
comprehensive array of services and supports for caregivers. During the COVID-19 crisis and
stay-at-home orders, FamilyMeans caregiver support staff have begun to initiate a number of
telesupport services including:

•

Conducting caregiver consultation over phone, Skype or Zoom. Anecdotally, themes of
increased stress due to stay-at-home orders, lack of in-person respite, and facility visiting
restrictions have begun to emerge.

•

Contacting individual clients via phone and writing notes to ensure needs are being met
and connections continue.

•

Providing in-home respite through volunteers over telephone and videoconference. One
volunteer found a streaming movie that a particular care receiver would enjoy. They
watched it simultaneously while the caregiver had a break for a couple of hours.

•

Offering online videos with messages from staff for respite care participants. The videos
are 20 minutes long and offer some social interaction and familiar faces for people with
memory loss.

•

Holding Memory Cafes via zoom. Memory Cafes are lunches supported by local
restaurants for people living with dementia and their caregivers. With restaurants closed,
these Cafes have moved to a virtual setting.

•

Holding Zoom coffee breaks with staff where anyone can join for drop-in support.

•

Increasing e-mail communication to weekly posts which include ideas for activities that
can be done from home (such as exploring a live eagle cam, online exercise classes, and a
self-care resource developed by mental health staff).
Services funded by Title III-E may differ in availability and response to COVID-19 and

connecting caregivers to local supports is necessary. Finding a caregiver support provider is a
phone call or mouse click away. Nationally caregivers can contact the Eldercare Locator which
can connect them to local information and assistance programs offered through states and area
agencies on aging.

Informal caregiving supports during COVID-19
Caregivers of older people living in community and long-term care settings are also
changing the types of support that they provide to older relatives as well as the ways that they are
seeking informal support for themselves in response to COVID-19. The following details some
of the emerging types of informal care that caregivers are providing from a distance, ways
caregivers are seeking their own support, and examples of caregiver individual and systems
advocacy to bring awareness to the impact of COVID-19 on senior care communities.
Providing informal caregiving from a distance
Staying connected
Caregivers have quickly adopted new ways of connecting with older relatives, often
supported with new technology. While family caregivers already used telephone and/or video
calls to connect with their older relatives, often to supplement in-person visits, this now has
become the main way many caregivers are staying connected with their relatives in community
or long-term care settings. Video calls have become especially popular, with caregivers using
these calls to substitute for in-person visits, as well as a means to reduce the social isolation of
older people who are not able to participate in their typical social activities. Older residents
might have their own tablets, such as an iPad, use a specially designed tablet geared toward older
people, such as GrandPads, or use facility owned tablets. For those living in facilities, workers
can help residents establish connections with these devices. Caregivers can also use these, or
other devices, such as laptops, for playing interactive games together, listening to concerts or
shows together, or doing other online activities together. Some caregivers and older relatives are
not as comfortable with smart phones or tablets, or are not able to afford this type of technology,

and instead rely on traditional phone calls. Caregivers are making use of lower-technology too,
such as letter writing or setting up penpals with family members, friends or grandchildren. There
are also a variety of new ways to connect in-person, while maintaining social distancing. For
example, some long-term care facilities are arranging window-greetings, where caregivers stand
outside the window and either wave or talk on the phone with their older caregivers, and family
members are visiting their older relatives through various forms of distant visits (driving their
cars by the facility while honking, singing to residents who are standing on a balcony, etc.)
Arranging delivery of essential items
Family caregivers have also taken on the responsibilities of arranging for delivery of
essential items, such as food or medication. For those caring for residents living in the
community, this activity keeps their older relatives from having to shop or otherwise venture in
the community. Family members might be doing the errands themselves, or arranging for a
delivery service to send needed items. Family caregivers caring for those in long-term care
settings also are delivering essential items, including items that the long-term care facility is no
longer able to procure during the pandemic.
Providing activities and information
Caregivers are also providing activities to loved ones that can help reduce social isolation
and fill the void left by the cancellation of their typical activities. The types of activities are
personalized based on their loved one’s interests and cognitive ability. Examples include books,
puzzles, craft materials, and devices for watching movies or shows or listening to audio books.
For those with more significant cognitive decline, activities could include a portable music
player with a playlist of their loved one’s favorite songs, photobooks or videos of family or

friends, or fidget blankets. Caregivers are also providing information to their older relatives
about COVID-19, such as the latest news on transmission, prevention and treatment, or state and
local ordinances, particularly for those who are not able to access news and information online.
Thanking long-term care workers
As caregivers are no longer able to visit long-term care settings during the Covid-19
crisis, the workers in these facilities are having to take on an additional supportive role. Workers,
who are often risking their own health to provide care for residents in long-term care settings,
have become the main source of social interaction for residents, particularly in facilities where
residents have been quarantined in their rooms. Caregivers are providing support for these
workers in a variety of ways, such as sending thank you notes or small gifts.
Monitoring from afar
One key activity that family caregivers typically do for older relatives in long-term care
facilities is to monitor the quality of care they are receiving. Caregivers are having to find new
ways to monitor when they are not able to visit, such as through increased communication with
workers and their supervisors, or monitoring while connecting with their loved one through
video or phone chats.
Taking action
Some family caregivers have been involved in advocacy efforts related to protecting
loved ones during the COVID-19 outbreak as well as protecting and supporting their paid
caregivers. This advocacy has been at multiple levels, including advocating at the institutional
level for long-term care facilities to adopt procedures to protect residents, such as requiring all
workers in a nursing home to wear masks or increasing transparency about the number of

residents who have tested positive for COVID-19; or at the state level, such as demanding that
states include protections for residents of long-term care facilities or provide COVID-19 testing
at all facilities throughout the state. Family caregivers have become community organizing and
advocacy leaders for protecting older people during COVID-19. Community advocacy activities
have included petitioning stores to have special hours or to require masks, organizing mask
drives to provide personal protective equipment for senior care workers, or leading parades and
concerts outside senior communities. Other caregivers have taken their voices to the media,
contacting reporters to publicize the COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care facilities and
pointing out the lack of a swift government response. They have shared both positive and
negative experiences in news articles and blogs. All of these can lead to policy changes and help
build community and support during uncertain times.
Getting informal caregiving support during COVID-19
While formal aging services programs are adapting to provide formal support for
caregivers during the COVID-19 outbreak, caregivers are also finding new ways to get informal
support for themselves. Many caregivers rely only on informal supports for their caregiving,
while others rely on a combination on formal and informal supports to assist them in caregiving
(Chow et al., 2010). The following describes key ways family members are seeking informal
supports.
Coordinating with other family members and friends
Caregivers of older adults have always had to coordinate and negotiate caregiving
responsibilities with other family members and friends, and other families and friends are often
the main source of caregiving support. During COVID-19, the focus of this coordination and

support has changed. Caregivers are now having to coordinate care from a distance, such as
scheduling regular communication through phone or video to help reduce social isolation. This
can also involve having families and friends making important decisions regarding whether to
remove their family members from a long-term care facility because of the dangers of COVID19, often with very incomplete information. Some extended families are developing COVID-19
plans to assist them in providing care and making decisions from a distance.
Online informal support
As in-person support groups are not available, many formal services have developed
telephone or video support groups for caregivers. Another type of informal, peer-led support
group has emerged: support groups on social media platforms. These support groups, which are
not facilitated by service providers or long-term care facilities, can give caregivers a more open
forum to not only provide each support, but to assist caregivers who might be frustrated with
facilities or service providers. Using social media for social support is particular relevant for
caregivers who are seeking caregiving support for the first time during stay-at-home orders, as
this type of support is available in real-time, and also can lead to a sense of empowerment among
participants who can share and access resources through these venues (Ammari &
Schoenebeck, 2015). The informal COVID-19 era caregiving support groups on social media
have also fostered advocacy on behalf of older family members. This type of support, while
useful, is only accessible to those who have the appropriate technology.
Recognizing competing responsibilities
Caregivers are also recognizing the competing sources of stress during the COVID-19
crisis. Not only are they worried about providing care from a distance to their older relatives,

they are also worried about the health of their family members who are at a high risk of death if
they become infected with COVID-19 because of their age and/or age-related health conditions.
For those whose loved ones are living in long-term care facilities, there is the compounded stress
of the high rates of COVID-19 within such facilities. With the required social distancing, family
caregivers can have a heightened sense of helplessness because they are not able to protect their
family members or provide the type or amount of care that they want to provide. In addition,
caregivers might simultaneously be adjusting to working at home, caring for children who are
home from school, coping with losing their job or some of their income due to state or city stayat-home rules or the economic downturn, and/or experiencing serious financial problems.
Caregivers also worry about becoming infected with COVID-19 themselves, or about other
family members and friends. All of these stressors make caregiving for older family members
during this global pandemic difficult.

Conclusion
There is much we do not know about the course of this pandemic and the long term
impacts on our communities, and gerontological research efforts on the effects of COVID-19 on
caregiving are just beginning. We know that COVID-19 will continue to transform the delivery
of long-term services and supports, including caregiver support, as well as the ways we interact
with our loved ones into the future. For older adults and their caregivers, social distancing and
fear may also continue when many have returned to work and the social distancing restrictions
are lifted. Gerontological research is needed to examine which types of formal caregiving
supports are needed and most effective during crises such as COVID-19, and which emerging
caregiving supports should be retained after this crisis ends. The field of social work must be
particularly attuned and sensitive to the needs of family caregivers who may be experiencing
added burden, stress, and depression, and the differences in needs based on a variety family
circumstances. Connecting caregivers to formal supports like the Title III-E network, as well as
offering suggestions for continued connection with their family members and for finding
informal sources of support, is helpful both during the global pandemic and after.

Notes
1. The authors recognize that there are numerous ways to define “caregivers.” For the purposes
of this article, “family caregivers” are defined as friends and families that provide care to an
older adult. They may receive some compensation for this care (such as a consumer directed
plan), but it is generally not considered a career. This is in contrast to paid direct care workers
who can often be referred to as formal or paid “caregivers.”
2. The majority of states and many cities in the United States implemented a variety of
temporary orders requiring or requesting residents to stay-at-home or shelter-in-place. There was
no uniformity to the language used to described these orders, and great variability in their length
and coverage (Mervosh et al. (2020).
