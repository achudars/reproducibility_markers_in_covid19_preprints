"4" "Abstract"
"5" "A number of international studies have found that the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with reductions in crime, primarily due to changes in the routine activities of the population. However, to date there has been no targeted exploration of how COVID-19 may have influenced youth offending, which may be more heavily impacted by the changes heralded by COVID-19 containment measures. This study examines changes in youth offending in an Australia jurisdiction, Queensland, following the implementation of COVID-19 containment measures from the period April to June, 2020. Additionally, differences in impacts across community types were explored. Findings from  panel regression indicated significant declines in youth property offending, offences against the person and public order offences in this period, but no significant changes in  illicit  drug offences. There were also  significant  differences across communities according to socio-economic status, per cent Indigenous population, and the extent of commercial or industrial land use. Findings are explored with reference to environmental crime theories and the potential impacts of social, economic and policing changes that occurred in this period."

"9" "Introduction"
"10" "The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020  has  heralded dramatic  changes to societies around the world. Public health containment measures aimed at reducing transmission of the virus greatly reduced social contact and movements of people though measures such as ‘stay at home’ orders, restrictions on travel, directives to work from home when possible, and closures of restaurants and bars, schools, and other services.  E arly investigations  have  documented a drop in  recorded crime  following the introduction of containment measures during the initial wave of the pandemic in March and April 2020. However,  a targeted analysis of  changes in youth offending over this period ha s  not yet been  undertaken . Through closures of schools and restrictions on movement and gatherings, the containment measures greatly altered the key social and developmental contexts of adolescents’ lives. This paper examines changes in re corded  offending by youth in Queensland, Australia, after containment measures were introduced in March 2020 , and  consider s  whether  impacts  vary  according to the characteristics of  communities. Our analyses provide the first detailed look at the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on youth offending."
"11" "Potential drivers of  youth  offending changes during  COVID-19"
"12" "The dominant theoretical frameworks for understanding how COVID-19 containment measures affected crime  have been  from the environmental criminology family,  in particular  routine activities theory and crime pattern theory. Routine activities theory (Cohen & Felson, 1979)  contends  that crime is more likely to occur when there is a convergence in space and time of likely offenders with suitable targets, in the absence of capable guardians. Crime pattern theory (Brantingham & Brantingham, 2013) focuses on key locations that people frequent, such as school, work, shops and places of recreation, and the movements between them. The intersections of offenders and targets in the course of these daily activities creates opportunities for crime."
"13" "As elsewhere, measures to contain transmission of COVID-19 in Queensland dramatically disrupted the routine activities of everyday life. More people stayed home, far fewer people travelled to work or school or to visit friends and family, and many recreational activities were cancelled   (see  timeline  of measures  in   Appendix A) .  Routine activities theory would suggest that these changes led to reductions in offending in some places, but increases in others. Fewer interactions between offenders and potential victims in public places,  such as retail and entertainment precincts  for instance, would reduce opportunities for some kinds of violent  and property  crime ( Halford et al., 2020 ). However,  the interpersonal stress of families being constrained to living and working in the home, combined with financial stresses resulting from lost income or job insecurity due to COVID-19 may have  increase d  the incidence of  domestic violence  (Payne  et al.  , 2020) . Residential burglary would be expected to fall, due to increased presence of  residential  guardians, while commercial properties might be  increasingly  targeted as businesses closed and mobility in non-residential areas decreased."
"14" "R esearch on the situational drivers of youth offending suggests that containment measures might have reduced opportunities for youth to offend even more dramatically than for adults. First, when youth converge in settings where they can spend time in unstructured activities without authority figures,  such as shopping malls, parks, schools and surrounding areas,  crime is more likely ( Bichler et al., 2014;  Osgood & Anderson, 2004).  In Australia,  COVID-19 containment measures rendered youths’ ability to  socialise  with peers in such settings very difficult ,   with measures  including  school closures,   restrict ions   on the size of  outdoor gatherings, and  temporary closures of  playgrounds and non-essential shops.  Second, s tay-at-home orders during COVID-19 greatly increased the amount of time that parents and other caregivers spent at home, and thus  reduced  the amount of time that youth  spent   unsupervised  (Agustina & Felson, 2015) . However, this was probably less true for children in households with adults who were essential workers  (e.g. social, health and retail workers) , who could not work from home."
"15" "Third, the closure of schools may have reduced youth offending in several ways. Schools structure adolescents’ routine activities, and they bring together youth with peers who might co-offend or encourage offending. Accordingly, journeys to and from school, along with the hours after school finishes, have been shown to be high-risk times for youth to commit crime (Lemiuex & Felson, 2012). Other studies show that areas near high schools experience higher crime rates than areas further from schools (Murray & Swatt, 2013)."
"16" "Existing evidence on crime and COVID-19"
"17" "Throughout 2020 investigations of COVID-19 and crime have been published  exploring  data from  a range of Western countries including  Australia (Andresen & Hodgkinson, 2020; Payne et al., 2020; Payne & Morgan, 2020; Kim & Leung, 2020; Rmandic et al., 2020), New Zealand (Cheung & Gunby, 2020), Europe (Gerell et al., 2020; Halford et al., 2020; O ffice for National Statistics , 2020), the USA (Abrams et al., 2020; Ashby, 2020; Campedelli et al., 2020a; Campedelli et al., 2020b; Felson et al., 2020),  and  Canada (Hodgkinson & Andresen, 2020). Most studies focus on the period when restrictions were first introduced in March and April 2020, and most examine changes in officially recorded crimes.  This body of research has varied widely in terms of the types of geographies examined (e.g. city vs. country), the types of crime examined, the definitions of offences and data sources used."
"18" "Despite these variations, a number of trends have emerged which are generally consistent with predictions from routine activities theory. The clearest trends are for property crimes and crimes against the person. Australian studies show decreases in residential burglary and theft (Andresen & Hodgkinson, 2020; Kim & Leung, 2020; Payne & Morgan, 2020; Rmandic et al., 2020), and this has also been observed in international studies (e.g. Campedelli et al., 2020b; Halford et al., 2020). There is also evidence that non-residential burglaries did not decline with the introduction of containment measures (Felson et al., 2020; Abrams et al, 2020; Ashby, 2020; Hodgkinson & Andresen, 2020 )."
"19" "Most researchers have found significant decreases in violence and crimes against the person immediately following COVID-19 containment measures. Although some authors examining US data have suggested that more serious violent offences such as homicide and assault with a deadly weapon did not decrease (Abrams et al, 2020; Asbhy, 2020; Campedelli et al., 2020b), early results suggest this was not true in Australia. Payne and colleagues (2020) reported significant decreases in sexual assault and serious assault in Queensland, but no change in common assault. Also examining Queensland data, Andresen and Hodgkinson (2020) reported significant declines in assault, robbery and total violence from late March. There was less change in other violence, although it was unclear which offences were included in this category. In New South Wales, Lim & Leung (2020) found significant decreases in non-domestic violence related assault and sexual offences from mid-March to the end of April, and Rmandic and colleagues (2020) reported a decrease in non-family-violence serious assaults from April. Internationally, early data suggest that domestic violence offences did not drop (Campedelli et al., 2020b; Kim and Leung, 2020), or increased (Rmandic et al., 2020) following introduction of containment measures."
"20" "Other crime types have been less studied and trends are inconsistent. For instance, in Australia, illicit drug offences appear to have either remained stable or increased during the initial phase of containment measures (Andresen & Hodgkinson, 2020; Kim and Leung, 2020; Rmandic et al., 2020). Observations for drug offences internationally are quite variable (Gerell et al, 2020; Abrams et al., 2020). There is also some evidence that public order offences have decreased, consistent with decreases in public forms of violence (Andresen & Hodgkinson, 2020; Halford et al., 2020)."
"21" "Community characteristics that may influence  changes in  youth offending during COVID-19"
"22" "T rends observed in large geographic areas like cities and states likely conceal substantial variation in offending in smaller areas (Stickle & Felson, 2020).  To date,  only Campedelli and colleagues (2020 a ) have systematically examined area-level correlates of crime changes  in Chicago .  They found influences of area-level socio-economic status on crime trends, with greater   community-level  income inequality associated with a higher likelihood of drops in assault and narcotics-related offences, but a lower likelihood of drops in burglary and robbery.  H igher  community  poverty rate s  w ere  associated with a lower likelihood of drops in burglary, but w ere  not related to drops in other crime types."
"23" "Considering criminological theories in the context of youth offending in Australia, there are a  number of  community  characteristics  that might  be  assumed to influence the nature of changes in youth offending following imposition of COVID-19 containment measures  in the Australian context . In general, youth offending has been found to be concentrated in  lower  socio-economic communities  (McCarthy, 2020).  Additionally, economic ally deprived communities may experience greater financial strain during COVID-19, which could increase motivation for offending  amongst young people residing in these communities  (Camp e delli et al., 2020 a ; Payne et al., 2020).   Some research also suggests there may be a greater concentration of  essential workers resid ing  in lower socio-economic areas  ( Garnier, Benetka, Kraemer, & Bansal, 2020 ) , thereby  constraining increases in guardianship in these communities during COVID-19. These factors collectively might  indicate   a lack of decline  in youth offending in low er -socio-economic communities during COVID-19.  However, the only study to system a tically consider the influence of area-level socio-economic status on changes in offending during COVID-19 found mixed effects  for  different types of offending (Campedelli et al., 2020a) , indicating that there may be a more complex array of factors at play in these communities ."
"24" "R outine activities theory would suggest that increased mobility and presence of residents in  residential areas  should reduce oppor t unities for property crime  (Halford et al., 2020) .     The potential impacts of COVID-19 on youth offending in communities that have large amounts of  commercial or industrial space  are less clear.   As noted, many non-essential businesses were forced to work remotely, or were staffed at low levels during the initial period of lockdown and to some extent during subsequent periods when sustained restrictions on movements and gathering remained. This may have created greater opportunities for property offending in areas where large industrial and commercial assets were subject to reduced levels of  guardianship  and  informal  surveillance . However, it  may  also  have reduced the opportunity for low-level property offences, such as shoplifting  and theft , due to non-essential business closures  and reduced foot traffic in commercial districts (Halford et al., 2020) ."
"25" "Communities with large  Indigenous populations  in the north and west of Queensland that were designated as remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities were subject to even stricter movement and quarantine restrictions, in agreement with the communities themselves, in order to protect the health of vulnerable populations living in these communities. While some exemptions existed for essential workers, people were required to quarantine for 14 days before entering or re-entering one of these designated communities from late March. From 12 June, 2020, the restrictions on these designated communities began to align more fully with restrictions for the rest of Queensland."
"26" "In addition to being subject to more strict restrictions on movement during the COVID-19 lockdown and following period, Indigenous communities have also experienced markedly higher levels of youth offending, which is likely at least in part a product of the much greater exposure to offending risk factors that young people in these communities experience, as well as potentially exposure to different justice system responses (Allard et al., 2020). Thus, communities with larger Indigenous populations may have experienced notably reduced youth offending due to the more limited movement of young people in and out of these communities during and following the COVID-19 lockdown."
"27" "The type of  community, whether a major city, regional or remote area, may experience a different mix of opportunities and risks for youth offending. In Queensland, rural and remote areas had very few cases of COVID-19 and as such had restrictions relaxed somewhat earlier than in major city areas of the states. Thus, there may have been differences in remaining opportunities for youth offending in  regional and remote communities in  this period."
"28" "The  current  study"
"29" "Th e current  study examines changes in reported offending by youth aged 10 to 17 years old in Queensland when COVID-19 containment measures were introduced. We examine  property offences,  offences against the person, illicit drug offences,  and  public order offences   up to the end of June 2020. Based on what is already known about crime and COVID-19, especially studies using Queensland data (Andresen & Hodgkinson, 2020; Payne et al., 2020; Payne & Morgan, 2020),  we expect to observe overall reductions in the number of youth offences against the person, property offences, and public order offences."
"30" "Queensland is the second largest state in Australia by land area, with a population of approximately 5.09 million (ABS, 2020 a ). Indigenous Australians comprise 4% of the Queensland population, but in some remote communities, Indigenous people can comprise up to 90% of the residents. Given the geographic and social diversity of Queensland, we consider whether changes in youth offending varied depending on  the following  community characteristics :   socioeconomic  status ;  the area percent age  of residential  space; the area percent age  of  commercial space ;  the percentage of the population that  identify as  Indigenous ;  and whether a community was in a regional or remote part of Queensland.  We anticipate that areas with a large per cent of residential land may have experienced greater reductions in youth offending during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, due to  the  increased mobility and guardianship of property in these areas (Halford et al., 2020) .   However,  w e  do not advance  specific  hypotheses for the role of  the other  community characteristics."
"31" "Method"
"32" "Design"
"33" "The unit of analysis in this study is the community, measured as the Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) .   SA2s represent areas in which residents interact socially and economically (ABS, 2011). In urban areas, SA2s broadly align to suburbs, and in regional and remote localities to larger functional areas such as towns.  There were in total   5 13  SA2s used in this study  out of a total of 5 30  SA2s  in Queensland , with  17  SA2s  being removed due to these a reas   comprising  no or very small residential populations ."
"34" "Data"
"35" "There are two key data sources for this study: Queensland Police Service (QPS) recorded crime data (QPRIME data); and A ustralian  B ureau of  S tatistics (ABS)  Census  and associated  data  sets . QPRIME data is the administrative database used for recording crime by QPS. Historical QPRIME data  are  stored in the Griffith University Social Analytics Laboratory (SAL) , a custom-built secure research facility  used  to store, manage and analyse sensitive administrative data for research and teaching purposes.  The data used in this  study reflect all recorded offences  by  young people aged 10 to 17 years  in the period  between 1 January 2018 and 30 June 2020."
"36" "Data from the most recent Census  (2016)   and associated data sets were  used to estimate community characteristics for each SA2.  ABS  Estimated Residential Population (ERP) figures   were  used to  estimate the size of the population in each SA2 in 2018 and 2019. However, ERP estimates at the SA2 level for 2020 were not available at the time of this study, so 2019 ERP  figures  were used to estimate populations  for  SA2s in  the first six months of  2020."
"37" "Measures"
"38" "Dependent variable: y outh o ffen ding"
"39" "QPRIME data  was extracted from  SAL for all offences linked to  a criminal incident  that had a start date between 1 January 2018 to 30 June 2020, where the offender was recorded as a young person aged 10 to 17 years (at the time of the o c currence ) . Offences were assigned to an SA2  using  the latitude and longitude of the offence location."
"40" "O ffences were   re coded from QPS offence codes to Australian and New Zealand Offence Classification (ANZSOC) codes.  O ffences were then organised into  f our  broad groupings: property offences; offences against the person; illicit drug offences; public order offences .  In the analysis, the dependent variables were the counts of youth offences in each of these four groupings of offence types."
"41" "P roperty offences  include s : unlawful entry with intent/burglary, break and enter, theft and related offences, fraud, deception and related offences; and property damage and environmental pollution  (ANZSOC Divisions codes 07 08 09, and 12) . Offences against the person  include s : homicide and related offences’ acts intended to cause injury; dangerous or negligent acts endangering persons; abduction, harassment and other offences against the person; and robbery, extortion and related offences (ANZSOC Divisions 01 to 06).    Illicit drug offences represented all offences coded to ANZSOC Division code 10, including: posses s /or use illicit drugs; deal or traffic illicit drugs; and manufacture or cultivate illicit drugs. Public order offences  were  all offences coded to ANZSOC Division codes 13, including: disorderly conduct; regulated public order offences; and offensive conduct."
"42" "Youth offending rates .  Youth offence rates were  used  to  descriptively   explore  changes in  each of the offence type s .  Offence rates were estimated by dividing the number of offences recorded against young people aged 10 to 17 years in a month, by the total population   for the identified communities in the reference year , and multiplied by 100,000, provid ing  a rate of youth offences per 100,000 persons ."
"43" "Independent variables"
"44" "COVID-19   containment measures .   T he first case of COVID-19 was detected  in Queensland   on  28  Jan uary   2020 ,   however  the  first  movement restrictions did not come into force until  March 23, 2020, following some initial cases of community transmission in Australia.   A timeline of the key containment measures  imposed  in Queensland  from March to June  is presented  in Appendix A .   The influence of COVID-19 is inferred to be greatest once social distancing measures and stay at home orders came into force in late March 2020, as this is when only those deemed essential workers were permitted to travel for work purposes , and the  general  population  were subject to a range of  restrictions on reasons for travel outside of their local area."
"45" "Figure  1  displays  Google community mobility  data  from mid - February to start of July 2020. This data  shows that from late March, visits to workplaces,  visits to  transit  ( public transport ) stations ,  retail and recreation venues, and parks declined dramatically, and stayed  below average through to  June 2020 , though start ed  to increase somewhat towards the end of the trend .   Concurrently, time spent in residential settings increased, and stayed higher than  average  through to June 2020."
"46" "T o estimate the influence that the COVID-19  containment measures  had on the opportunity context for youth offending, a dummy variable  was included  in our analysis that indicates a period of influence of COVID-19,  spanning from months  April to June 2020, in which restrictions to movement and  gathering   were imposed  (these months were coded as 1).  The remaining 27-month period prior to these changes, from 1 January 2018 through to 31 March 2020, were coded as the pre-COVID-19 period (coded as 0)."
"47" "Figure 1: Google mobility data for Queensland, from 10 February 2020 to 30 June 2020"
"48" "Community characteristics"
"49" "To examine the  influence of area-level  socio-economic status  (SES)  on changes in youth offending , d eciles of t he ABS Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage (IRSD) w ere  used to  determine the relative socio-economic status of each SA2 . The I SRD   takes  into account factors such as employment, education, welfare payments,  and  housing. Areas are ranked and organised into deciles reflecting the degree of relative socio-economic disadvantage, with 1 representing the highest levels of disadvantage, and 10 representing the lowest levels of disadvantage."
"50" "To understand how  the COVID-19 containment measures  may have changed  opportunity contexts and  patterns of youth offending in  residential areas , the  per cent  of each SA2 designated as residential land was estimated.  Indicative l and use categories  for Mesh Blocks, which constitute the smallest ge o graphic structure in the ABS geographic classification, we re  used to estimate the  per cent  of land (of total area squared kms)  in each SA2  that was categorised at residential land  (ABS, 2016) .  Similarly, t he per cent of land in each SA2 designated as  commercial and industrial  was estimated by summing the  land covered by  relevant Mesh Blocks in each of the SA2s  designated  as  commercial or industrial  space ,  and dividing this by the total area squared kms in each SA2  (ABS, 2016) ."
"51" "Per cent  Indigenous population  in each SA2 was estimated from ABS data ( ABS, 2020 b ) ,  as was the  per cent of land in each SA2  designated  as  regional or remote  (1) or major city (0) ( ABS, 2016).     In order to  account  for  seasonal variations  in youth offending, a   four-level categorical v ariable representing the season for each month was used as a control  variable in the analysis ."
"52" "Analytic approach"
"53" "To examine changes in youth offending prior to and post the start of the COVID-19  containment measures from April 2020 , a  Poisson  panel analysis with random effects was used.  The unit of observation was the SA2, and month was included as the time factor, with a total 30 months included in the analysis.  Poisson p anel analysis  enables examination of a time-series of cross-sectional data to determine drivers of the changes in th ese  data.  The random effects model was used in order to permit examination of  the influence of time-invariant community characteristics on changes in youth offending   (Bell  et al. , 2019) ."
"54" "While  there was some evidence of over-dispersion in the data  suggesting   a negative binomial distribution might be appropriate, the Poisson model was  preferred   due to th e  ability  of this model  to include cluster-robust standard errors, which can account for heteroskedasticity in the data and for  auto-correlation  within clusters ( i.e.  communities) across time.  Uncontrolled intra -cluster correlations can result in  biased estimates because of  artificially small standard errors (Colin & Miller, 2015),  posing   a  non-trivial  source of uncontrolled error in negative binomial panel models."
"55" "T he  log of the population in each SA2  in the relevant year   was  used as an offset  to the volume of youth offences in each SA2 in the Poisson panel analysis .  An offset   adjust s  the volume of event counts to the volume of event opportunities  across observations .  In this case, the number of youth offences in an SA2 are adjusted for the number of residents living in th e  SA2, with the size of the residential population serving as an indicator of the volume  of offending opportunities in an area."
"56" "Four  Poisson panel models were run examining the influence of COVID-19  containment measures  and community characteristics  on  youth  property offending, offences against the person, illicit drug offences,  and  public order offences  respectively . Each model included a   dummy variable  reflecting the introduction of COVID-19  containment measures  (months April to Jun e  2020), and a  season variable to  control for the influence of seasonal variations in offending. Each model also included interactions of the COVID-19  dummy  with: the relative  SES  of the  community ; the per cent of residential  land in a community ; the per cent of commercial and industrial  land  in a community; the per cent of population that identifies as Indigenous Australian; and the  per  cent of  a community  designated  as regional or remote.   These interactions enable identification of any differences in the impact of COVID-19 restrictions  on youth offending across different  community characteristics ."
"57" "Results"
"58" "The characteristics of the Queensland communities (SA2s) included in this study can be seen in Table 1  (note: the IRSD deciles are evenly distributed across SA2s, so are not shown) .  Figures 2A  and  2 B  display trends in  youth  offending rates (per 100,000 persons)   from January 2018 to June 2020   for  property offending  (2A) ,  and for   offences against the person ,  illicit drug  offences,   and  public order offences  (2B) ,  respectively .  Examination of the rates of youth offending over the 30-month time period s uggest  that  there have been  substantial declines following the introduction of COVID-19 related  containment  measures  for nearly all offence types, with the exception of illicit drug offences ."

"90" "Table 2 displays the results of the Poisson panel regression with random effects  examining whether the   period of   COVID-19  containment measures from April 2020  was associated with   changes in  youth offending .  The period of COVID-19 containment measures was associated with statistically significant decreases in the number of recorded youth offences against the person, property offences, and public order offences, but not illicit drug offences. Several statistically significant interactions also suggested that the magnitude of the COVID-19-related decline in youth offending varied depending on a range of community characteristics. Specifically, the decline in property offending varied according to SES, per cent commercial/industrial land use, and per cent of the community residents identifying as Indigenous. The decline in public order offences also varied according to SES. There were no statistically significant interactions for youth offences against the person or illicit drug offences."
"91" "T o  examine  the nature of the  significant  interactions for property and public order offences, we graphically examined the rate of offending over time at high and low values of the community characteristics. Figures 3A and 3B show the rate of youth property and public order offending in higher SES communities (IRSD deciles 6 to 10) and lower SES communities (IRSD deciles 1 to 5). Consistent with the main effects for SES (Table 2), Figures 3A and 3B suggest that youth property and public order offending w ere  significantly higher in lower SES communities over the entire period. However, the COVID-19 containment measures appear to have heralded notably steeper declines in these types of youth offending in lower SES communities, reducing a substantial amount of the disparity between lower and higher SES communities during this period."
"92" "Figure 4A displays rates of youth property offending for communities in the top quartile for the proportion of the population that identifies as Indigenous (N=128 SA2s) and the rest of QLD.   T he top quartile was used  as a  comparison group, rather than using a median split of the variable, due to the positive skew for the  per cent  of Indigenous people across communities. The top quartile included communities that had between 5.0% and 97.3% of Indigenous people residing in the community. While Figure  4A  indicate s  that communities with larger Indigenous populations experienced higher rates of  youth  property offending  in general  compared to the rest of Queensland  (consistent with the main effects for per cent Indigenous population in Table 2) , the decline in  youth property  offending during the COVID-19  containment measures   was steeper in communities with a higher Indigenous population."

The figure shows that rates of youth property offending were higher in communities with more commercial and industrial space over the entire 30 months  (consistent with the main effects for per cent commercial/industrial space displayed in Table 2) , but that the decline in  youth property  offending was greater for these communities, compared to those with less commercial space, during the  initial stages of the  COVID-19  pandemic ."

"198" "Discussion"
"199" "This study examined the impacts of the COVID-19  pandemic  on youth offending  during  a period in Queensland  ( April to June 2020 )   when  movements outside of the home   were significantly  restricted due to  a  range of   COVID-19  containment  measures. Our  findings suggest this period was associated with  significant  declines in most forms of youth offending, including property offending,  offences against the person,  and  public order offences. The only form of youth offending examined in this study that did not significantly  change  was illicit drug offences.  These findings are largely  consistent  with recent research on the  initial  impacts of COVID-19 on adult offending across jurisdictions, which have foun d declines in  adult  property offending  (Andresen & Hodgkinson, 2020; Kim & Leung, 2020;  Rmandic et al., 2020 ; Campedelli et al., 2020b; Halford et al., 2020) ,  some  forms of  violent offending  (Abrams et al., 2020; Ashby, 2020; Campedelli et al., 2020b) , public order offences  (Andresen & Hodgkinson, 2020; Halford et al., 2020) ,   and  which  have found inconsistent effects for drug offending  (Gerell et al., 2020; Abrams et al., 2020) .  This suggests that  at an aggregate level ,   patterns of youth offending have changed in similar ways to patterns of adult offending   found in  Australian and international jurisdictions ."
"200" "These findings confirm that the initial stages of COVID-19 presented a significantly transformed opportunity context for youth offending. As noted, one of the key factors likely to have influenced this is changes in routine activities for  a  large proportion of the population, which involved many adults working from home, children and young people doing schooling from home, and in general limited opportunit ies  for young people to meet away from the home. These changes in movements would have increased guardianship of young people by parents, increased informal surveillance and guardianship of residential property, reduced opportunities for in-person peer interactions,  and in general reduced opportunities for  potential  youth offenders to cross paths with potential victims,  thereby reducing opportunities  for a range of  you th crime ."
"201" "T he current study also found  that  different types of communities experienced different  changes  in  youth offending, adding to a limited body of research examining  the  influence  of community characteristics  on offending during COVID-19 (Campedelli et al., 2020a) .  Youth  property offending d eclined to a significantly greater degree  in communities that were lower  in  socio-economic statu s , had  proportionately larger  Indigenous population s ,  and  that had  greater  commercial or industrial land use.  Lo wer socio-economic status  communities  also displayed greater declines in   public order offences  compared to  higher socio-economic  communities.  The greater declines in youth  property   offending in lower socio-economic communities  contrasts with recent U.S. research  on adult offending , which found a lower likelihood of declines in burglary and robbery in communities with greater poverty or income inequality  (Campedelli et al., 2020a) . It  suggests that guardianship and  surveillance  may have been  equivalent or greater  in lower socio-economic communities . It also   suggests   there  is  unlikely to  have  be en  a disproportionate concentration of essential workers in lower socio-economic communities  leading to reduced guardianship in these communities as residents continued to travel to work , as might   have been  expected  ( Garnier, Benetka, Kraemer, & Bansal, 2020 ) . It  might also   indicate  that higher socio-economic communities  contained  a greater  relative  volume of  suitable  targets ( properties ) , for example  unoccupied  properties in tourist areas ( see  Andresen & Hodgkinson, 2020).    Moreover, t his finding  m ight   point to  additional drivers for changes in recorded youth offending in this period , aside from changes in routine activities ."
"202" "Economic theories of crime  would  suggest that communities experiencing greater financial stress or economic deprivation  would  experience increase s in youth  offending (Entorf & Spengler, 2000). However, during the initial stages of t he  COVID-19 pandemic, the  Australian government introduced a range of measures to financially support individuals and households affected by job losses and business closures. The two most important policy responses, announced in late March, were (1) a Coronavirus Supplement that substantially increased the payment rate for people accessing income support payments, including unemployment benefits (called ‘JobSeeker’), and (2) a wage subsidy paid to businesses substantially affected by required closures to enable them to retain eligible workers at a rate of $1,500 a fortnight (called ‘JobKeeper’). Together, JobSeeker and JobKeeper are estimated to have reduced measures of poverty and housing stress to  below  pre-COVID levels (Phillips et al. ,  2020; Leishman et al. ,  2020). The largest reductions in household poverty were estimated to be in the lowest-income households (Phillips et al .,  2020).  This research suggests that rather than COVID-19 being associated with increased financial  stress and  deprivation in low socio-economic communities, these financial supports may in fact have temporarily lessened financial deprivation in the lowest-income households.  Reduced financial deprivation in  low income and welfare-dependent families  may have  temporarily  tempered motivation for offending among disadvantaged young people  in these families .    This  requires  further exploration."
"203" "The significantly greater declines in  youth property offending  in Indigenous communities may also reflect some of the changed social and economic conditions that are noted with respect to lower socio-economic communities, as Indigenous Australians experience  disproportionately  high   entrenched  disadvantage  ( AIHW, 2017 ) . However, remote Indigenous communities also experienced even greater restrictions in movement into and out of communities during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic due to the health vulnerabilities experienced by people in these communities, with quarantine required for anyone re-entering a community during April to June 2020. This may have greatly restricted opportunities for young  offenders in these communities  to travel to nearby communities to  find  suitable targets for property crime .  Additionally, young people in these communities may have held grave r  concerns about the risk to their families and elders of travelling outside of their communities, and thus may have been deterred from moving between communities in order to protect their families."
"204" "The greater declines for  youth  property offending in communities with a  larger  proportion of commercial or industrial land use  may  reflect the temporary closure of non-essential businesses and entertainment precincts during this period .   As noted,  commercial  precincts are in general hotspots for youth offending ,  represent ing  crime attracting and generating locations   where  potential  youth offenders can interact with a broad range of potential  targets ( victims  and property)   (Brantingham & Brantingham, 2013) . While it  could  be assumed that the reduced guardianship of commercial and industrial properties  might  have led to  increased opportunities for property offending,  the level of  security for these  temporarily closed commercial or industrial  properties may have been sufficiently deterring for youth offenders  (Halford et al., 2020) .  Interestingly, the extent of residential land use in a community had no impact o n  changes in youth offending , contrary to our hypothesis that areas with larger residential spaces would experienced greater reductions in youth offending .  Recent studies have  suggested  that changes in mobility during COVID-19 may  be  a  primary driver of reduced offending during COVID-19, but may operate differently across residential and commercial  contexts ,  with  increased  mobility in residential areas  leading to reduced offending via  increased  property  guardianship, and  reduced  mobility in commercial areas  leading to reduced offending via   diminished  offending opportunities due to closures  of  retail and  entertainment  vendors  (Halford et al., 2020; Langton et al., 2020) . If this is correct, the  relatively lower magnitude of increased mobility in residential areas  in Queensland  in this period  may have  led to  comparably modest  declines   in  youth offending,  compared to commercial/industrial areas   in Queensland ,   where notabl y  larger declines in movements  may have  led  to   significantly greater declines in youth offending ."
"205" "Changes in f ormal surveillance  or policing  during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic  may have also played a role  in  reducing  youth offending  during  this period  (Langton  et al. , 2020) . While some police resources were re - allocated to manage border restrictions , enforce social distancing measures and  other COVID-19 related p riorities ,  the  polic e  remaining in these communities may have had  greater  visibility of suspicious behaviour due to  a reduced volume of  foot  and car  traffic. This increased risk  of detection  may have had a deterrent effect on young people . This could also explain the lack of decline in illicit drug offending in this period, as movements required to purchase drugs may have been more visible to police, due to reduced traffic in this period.  Conversely , if there was a n overall  net reduction in police resources  in disadvantaged communities  where police tend to be more concentrated ,  the decline in recorded  youth  offending  in these communities  may reflect to some extent reduced detection of offending by young people in this period."
"206" "While COVID-19 may become a less  pervasive  concern in Australia with the promise of  wide-spread  vaccin ation , the effects of this period on declines in youth offending , particularly in disadvantaged communities,  may have some important insights  that can inform  youth crime prevention interventions in to future .  Recent research in Queensland has found that while the number of youth offenders continues to decline, there has been a concurrent growth in the volume of the youth chronic offending population, who have been responsible for  approximately  50% of youth offences in recent years (McCarthy, 2020). The greater declines in youth offending in more disadvantaged communities during the initial stages of COVID-19 may provide some important insights into the drivers and deterrents of offending in this chronic offending population, who tend to offend predominantly in these communities (McCarthy, 2020).  Research conducted over a longer time period  would  enable  greater  disentangle ment   of  the relative impacts   of the changes in social, economic and policing conditions on  youth  offending, as these containment measures  are  progressively lifted in  2020 and 2021 .  This type of analysis is especially important as  conditions are likely to be conducive to  a resurgence in  youth offending, as unemployment increases, financial supplements decrease, and interruptions to schooling impact on educational engagement."
"207" "A key limitation for this study is the use of recorded crime data, which can undercount particular types of under-reported offences (e.g.  intimate partner violence ), and may also reflect to some extent the distribution of police resources. Additionally, the  classification  of offences into high-level groupings may obscure i mportant  differences in offending sub-types, however there was insufficient space to explore these differences in the current study.  Lastly, our variable representing COVID-19 containment measures start s  in April 2020,  and thus  may not fully capture   activity changes that pre- dated  official containment measures."
"208" "Conclusion"
"209" "This study found declines in youth property offending, offences against the person and public order offences during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, in line with existing studies of adult offending across  a range of  jurisdictions , with no  evidence of impacts  on illic i t drug offences . Importantly, the findings of this study suggest significantly different impacts of COVID-19 containment measures  across communities , with greater declines in lower socio-economic, Indigenous and more highly commercial/industrial communities .  More detailed  research   in  disadvantage d  communities  would  be   well- placed to  identify  the   social,  economic or policing factors that were most influential in  reducing   reco r ded offending  behaviour of young people in this period.  These factors  could  be harnessed in different ways through youth crime preventio n  initiatives , which may become increasingly important as   social and economic conditions  appear  conducive to a resurgence in youth offending."
