RUNNING HEAD: LCA ALCOHOL USE COVID-19

Abstract
Introduction: Two not mutually exclusive theories have been proposed to explain the
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on alcohol use: The Availability hypothesis contends
that reduced opportunities to drink due to the closure of outlets and consumption sites
should lead to decreases in alcohol use, whereas the Stress and Coping hypothesis
argues that those exposed to stressful situations may increase drinking.
Aims: This study aimed to test such hypotheses by describing pre/during-COVID-19pandemic changes in patterns of alcohol use among the Italian young adults (18–34
years).
Methods: This study involves the secondary analysis of data collected in 2015 and 2020
from nationally representative samples of Italian young adults. Latent class analysis
(LCA) was used to identify common patterns of alcohol use.
Results: Five classes were found: current non-drinker class (CND), weekend risky
(WRD) and weekend non-risky drinkers (WnRD), daily non-risky (DnRD) and daily
risky drinkers (DRD). Results indicate gender-specific changes in the prevalence of the
five drinker profiles from 2015 to 2020.
Conclusions: In support to the Availability hypothesis, increases in abstaining women
and men were observed, however among men there were also increases in the
prevalence of patterns characterized by risky drinking and related harm (Stress and
Coping hypothesis).

Keywords: Drinking patterns; Young people; Lockdown; Person-centred approach.

RUNNING HEAD: LCA ALCOHOL USE COVID-19

Introduction
The COVID-19 outbreak has dramatically impacted the life of young people
throughout the world, as nations implemented social distancing, isolation measures and
restrictions to social life and to the operations of drinking venues in the attempt to
reduce the spread of the virus. These measures are likely to have had an impact on
several outcomes, including alcohol use. Alcohol use and misuse is one area of special
concern for policymakers, practitioners and academics, and it is therefore important to
develop a nuanced understanding of the ways in which patterns of alcohol consumption
were affected by the health emergency. As the global pandemic continues, this
knowledge is especially important as prevention scientists and other researchers develop
targeted interventions to address the needs among high-risk groups. This repeated crosssectional study examined changes in alcohol use among Italian young adults. To this
end, we analysed data collected from nationally representative samples in 2015 and in
2020, during the November lockdown imposed to contain the COVID-19 second wave
in Italy.

Changes in alcohol use during the COVID-19 health emergency
The association between alcohol use and the COVID-19 outbreak may not be
univocal. There are indeed two not mutually exclusive mechanisms and accompanying
hypotheses to understand the effects of this pandemic on alcohol use (Rehm et al.,
2020). The Availability hypothesis contends that reduced opportunities to drink due to
social distance measures and the closure of outlets and consumption sites should lead to
decreases in alcohol use in the general population and especially among lighter drinkers.
The Stress and Coping hypothesis argues that those exposed to stressful situations, such

4

RUNNING HEAD: LCA ALCOHOL USE COVID-19

as social isolation and socioeconomic insecurity, may experience mental health issues,
which may contribute to increases in alcohol use as a dysfunctional coping strategy (i.e.,
self-medication), especially as the emergency continues for a long time (Khantzian,
1997). The tendency to self-medicate can be further exacerbated because traditional
support mechanisms (i.e., social support and community services for treatment) around
alcohol reduction may have become less accessible during the lockdown (Nicholls &
Conroy, 2021).
Both hypotheses received empirical support across a number of studies. In Sallie
et al. (2020) international study, drinking behaviours decreased overall during
quarantine, though 36% of the sample reported an increase in alcohol use. Garnett et al.
(2021) found about the same proportion of UK adults (25%) reporting drinking more
and less alcohol than usual during the COVID-19 related lockdown with those younger,
female, of high socioeconomic position, suffering from an anxiety disorder, and stressed
about finances or COVID-19 to be at greater risk. Others studies in the UK and Norway
indicate that increased alcohol use and misuse were associated with psychological,
social and economic stress and vulnerability (Alpers et al., 2021; Naughton et al., 2021).
Globally, findings of studies on the adult population in Australia, Canada and the U.S.A
offer further empirical support to each hypothesis (Callinan et al., 2021; Callinan et al.,
2020; Knell et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2020; Wardell et al., 2020; Zajacova et al., 2020).
Collectively, these studies provide evidence for non-univocal changes in
drinking behaviour during the pandemic. However, there is currently limited evidence
on the effects on the young adult population. It is likely that COVID-19 restrictions may
have had a greater impact on younger drinkers who have a richer social life outside their
home, which often includes drinking at parties and public venues (White et al., 2020).

5

RUNNING HEAD: LCA ALCOHOL USE COVID-19

For this reason, the Availability hypothesis may be particularly suitable for
understanding the impact of the pandemic on this age cohort. For example, decreased
alcohol use has been found among U.S. college student samples experiencing reduced
opportunities to socialise and greater parental control as they moved back with parents
(Graupensperger et al., 2021). On the other hand, young people may be stressed by the
disruptions to their lives caused by the pandemic and the most vulnerable may acutely
suffer as a result. In a U.S. study, symptoms of depression and anxiety due to university
closings were linked to greater increases in alcohol consumption (Lechner et al., 2020).
In Europe, a study of German young adults demonstrated that 24.4% reported a
decrease in binge drinking while 5.4% reported an increase (Busse et al., 2021). These
results suggest a rough estimate of the relative proportion of the young adult population
who may respond to the pandemic consistent with either the Availability and Stress and
Coping hypotheses.

Gender differences in alcohol use during the pandemic
Gender differences in alcohol use are well established and gender-specific
analyses are almost always warranted. Despite convergence in the amount of alcohol
consumed by men and women, women generally continue to report lower levels of
alcohol use than men (Kuntsche et al., 2011; Wilsnack et al., 2009). Theory and
research suggest that lighter drinkers will consume less alcohol as an effect of the health
emergency; thus, in general, one may expect that women responded to the pandemic by
consuming even less alcohol than pre-pandemic. At the same time, the associations
between stress and alcohol misuse may differ by gender such that women are more
likely to drink to regulate negative affect and stress reactivity compared to men (Peltier

6

RUNNING HEAD: LCA ALCOHOL USE COVID-19

et al., 2019). Pandemic-related stressors may represent unique challenges to the life of
early adults. To this date, the evidence for gender differences is mixed. While some
studies suggest that women highly stressed by the pandemic increased their alcohol use
and reported similar levels compared to men (Rodriguez et al., 2020), others did not
confirm such effect (Schmits & Glowacz, 2021). In addition, the stress ̶ alcohol misuse
relation appears be mediated by coping and social drinking motives, which are more
closely connected to binge drinking among men than women (Temmen & Crockett,
2020).

Current study
Results of the studies described in the previous section provide evidence on the
mechanisms of change assumed by both the Availability and the Stress and Coping
hypotheses. There are, however, important limitations to the state of art in regard to
research design and sample representativeness. Most studies measured alcohol use
cross-sectionally asking respondents to assess their alcohol consumption during and
prior to the pandemic (Busse et al., 2021). This is a convenient strategy that offers
insight on self-perceived changes in behaviours, but it is susceptible to distortion and
recall bias, including greater underreporting of behaviour that was put in place in a more
distant past (Althubaiti, 2016). Further, besides a few exceptions (e.g., Garnett et al.,
2021), most studies used convenience samples, which put into question the
generalizability of findings and may account for differences in results across studies
(e.g., in the proportion of individuals who transitioned to heavier or lighter drinking
patterns).

7

RUNNING HEAD: LCA ALCOHOL USE COVID-19

There are three key novel aspects to this study that addressed these limitations.
First, the use of data collected prior and during the pandemic from nationally
representative samples overcomes key methodological limitations of alcohol use
measurement and to result generalizability. Second, we used a different approach to data
analysis, the person-centred approach (e.g., Latent Class Analysis ̶ LCA), which
consists of a classification system that groups individuals into distinct subgroups or
typologies (i.e., drinker profiles) (see, among others, Collins & Lanza, 2010). Once
developed, these typologies can be used to examine changes in class prevalence and
transition probabilities across time and cohorts (Aresi et al., 2021; Cleveland et al.,
2012). Analysing groups of individuals allows one to simultaneously test both the
Availability and Stress and Coping hypotheses on different subgroups identified in the
classification. Third, to our knowledge, this is the first published study that uses
samples from a Southern European country. This is important because in these countries
a "wet", non-intoxication-oriented drinking culture is still dominant among young
people (Aresi et al., 2018; Aresi et al., 2020; Beccaria, 2010; Room, 2007).
Characteristics of these cultures, such as more frequent but moderate alcohol use, and
the mild weather and relaxed alcohol policies (which in turn, make drinking in the open
air in public places very common among youth) (Aresi & Pedersen, 2016; Calafat et al.,
2011), may determine different responses to the health emergency as compared to other
countries. For these reasons, examining changes in alcohol use patterns among Italian
young adults in response to the pandemic-related containment measures in Italy is of
high interest for researchers and policymakers.

Italy's response to the COVID-19 health emergency in regard to alcohol outlets

8

RUNNING HEAD: LCA ALCOHOL USE COVID-19

Interventions to combat the spread of the first wave of the epidemic in Italy were
introduced as early as February 2020, followed by a two-month strict national lockdown
(Governo Italiano, 2020a). In November 2020, as the second wave was approaching, the
Italian government established a three-tier scheme (yellow, orange, and red) in an
attempt to avoid a second national lockdown (Governo Italiano, 2020b). Italy’s 19
regions and two autonomous provinces were assigned to tiers on a weekly basis based
on data related to the speed of spread of the infection (e.g., Rt transmission index) and
the burden on the healthcare system (e.g., degree of saturation of intensive care units).
Limitations to people’s mobility (e.g., a 10 p.m. curfew was introduced) and business
operations including of alcohol outlets (e.g., opening hours), were enforced across all
tiers. However, all on-premise consumption was forbidden, except under the yellow tier
between 5:00am and 6:00pm. Off-premise consumption and delivery were allowed at
all times and under all tiers. Differently than in other countries (Rehm et al., 2020),
alcoholic beverages were included in the list of essential goods and services that could
be purchased during the lockdown period, and were therefore sold across a variety of
sites including supermarkets as it is in usual times.
In sum, Italy's response to the pandemic in November 2020 may have at least in part
determined differences in drinking patterns across regions depending on the tier they
were assigned to. Despite reduced availability of on-premise offerings, alcohol use was
available off-premise, including delivery, at all times and across all tiers.

Aims
This study compares patterns of alcohol use among Italian young adults in 2015 and
during the November 2020 COVID-19 lockdown. The primary aim was to report
changes in the prevalence of drinker profiles characterised by different weekly alcohol

9

RUNNING HEAD: LCA ALCOHOL USE COVID-19

use patterns and risk of harm. More specifically, by using LCA, our study aimed to (a)
Identify distinct classes of individuals based on a set of alcohol use indicators,
separately by gender; (b) Examine the consistency of the latent class solution and
membership proportions across two cohorts (2015 and 2020); (c) Examine the
associations among belonging to classes and lockdown tiers.

Hypotheses
Based on findings of previous studies using LCA indicating that drinker class
solutions tend to be relatively stable across gender and time (Aresi et al., 2021;
Cleveland et al., 2012), we expected the number and characteristics of the classes will
be broadly the same across the 2015 and 2020 cohorts. In addition, we stated the
following hypotheses:
Hp1. There has been an increase in the prevalence of both low- and high-risk
drinking patterns along with a decrease in moderate drinking patterns;
Hp2. Living in stricter lockdown tiers would be associated to belonging to
profiles that are characterised by abstention and moderate drinking.

Methods

Data
This study involves the secondary analysis of data collected by the ©Osservatorio
Giovani of the Istituto Toniolo di Studi Superiori (Milan, Italy) from nationally
representative samples of Italian young adults. Data were collected in two cohorts:
December 2015 and November 2020 during the second COVID-19 lockdown in Italy.

10

RUNNING HEAD: LCA ALCOHOL USE COVID-19

Sampling and Computer Assisted Web Interview (CAWI) data collection was
conducted by Ipsos s.r.l. Each cohort data is weighted to account for the non-random
nature of the sample and guarantee sample representativeness of the Italian young adult
(18 to 34 years old) population in respect to several socio-demographic characteristics
including gender, age-range, educational level, occupation status, and geographic area.
The Italian 18-34 year population was 10,374,465 and 10,630,814 in 2015 and in 2020,
respectively (Istituto Nazionale di Statistica, 2015, 2020). In both samples, lifetime
abstainers (2015: N = 521; 2020: N = 264) were excluded from the analyses, resulting
in analytical samples of 5,950 and 1,736 participants in 2015 and 2020, respectively.
Table 1 displays weighted socio-demographic characteristics of participants by cohort.

Table 1

This study was reviewed and approved by the ©Osservatorio Giovani of the Istituto
Toniolo di Studi Superiori. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki. All participants provided their written informed consent to participate in
this study.

Measures
Both surveys included data on gender, age, occupation, and region of residence.
Participants were asked if they ever had any alcohol. Next, they indicated the number of
drinks consumed each day of a typical week in the last month (three months in 2015),
using the Daily Drinking Questionnaire (Collins et al., 1985), how many times during
the past month they had gotten drunk, and the number of times they had consumed four

11

RUNNING HEAD: LCA ALCOHOL USE COVID-19

(females) or five (males) or more drinks within two hours. Examples of drinks (e.g., a
250ml beer) containing approximately 10g pure ethanol were presented.
In 2015, participants also completed seven dichotomous items (0 = no, 1 = yes)
adapted from the Brief Young Adult Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire (BYAACQ;
Kahler et al., 2008). The summed score of these items represented the total number of
consequences experienced in the previous 30 days (for a description of the items, see
Aresi et al., 2018).
Participants of the 2020 cohort were also assigned to lockdown tiers (0 = yellow;
1 = orange; 2 = red) depending on their region of residence allocation during the four
weeks prior to data collection. In those cases when regions changed tier during that
period, they were assigned to the tier they have been assigned the longest. Five, nine
and seven regions were assigned to the yellow, orange and red tier, respectively (Table
S1).

Data analysis
Similarly to previous studies (e.g., Aresi et al., 2020), ten dichotomous indicators of
drinking were developed: (1) past month alcohol use; (2) past month drunkenness; (3)
past month Heavy Episodic Drinking (HED); and (4–10) indicators of alcohol use for
each day of a typical week. Based on these indicators, sub-groups of individuals
characterized by common patterns of multiple alcohol use behaviours were identified
using LCA. Because LCA does not allow to include weighting, non-weighted data were
used. All analyses were conducted separately by gender.
Following established recommendations (Lanza et al., 2011), a series of
statistical models were estimated first in the 2015-2020 combined sample and then

12

RUNNING HEAD: LCA ALCOHOL USE COVID-19

separately within each cohort, followed by examination of measurement invariance. For
a description of the statistical (absolute and relative model fit indices) and conceptual
standards used to compare the different profile solutions see Sorgente et al. (2019). To
provide support to the validity of the classes, the pseudo-class method was used to test
differences in rates of experiencing alcohol-related consequences by members of the
2015 classes. Lastly, the three-step procedure was used to test the effect of lockdown
tiers on class membership probabilities (Asparouhov & Muthén, 2014). Analyses were
performed in MPlus 7.11 (Muthén & Muthén, 1998-2015) using the robust maximum
likelihood estimator.

Results

Descriptive statistics
Table 2 displays the proportion of participants who reported each alcohol use behaviour,
separately by cohort. A greater proportion of 2015 participants reported having drunk in
the past month as compared to 2020. Saturday and Sunday drinking were more
prevalent in 2015, whereas a greater proportion of 2020 participants reported HED in
the previous two weeks.

Table 2

Identification of latent classes of alcohol use behaviours
We compared models with two to six latent classes, separately by gender. As seen in
Table 3 and 4, for both women and men, each of the relative fit indices (CAIC and

13

RUNNING HEAD: LCA ALCOHOL USE COVID-19

ssBIC) decreased with each additional solution. The other fit indices did not provide
clear evidence to support either the five or six-class model, except that the six-class
solution exhibited the highest value of cmP and presented a number of standardized
residual lower than |3|. For these reasons, the six-model solution was examined first.
Inspection of item probabilities of this model, however, revealed that latent classes were
not clearly distinguished (Table S2). On the other hand, classes of the five-class model
were relatively distinguishable and interpretable, and entropy was higher than the sixclass model. Thus, this model was deemed the best-fitting, most interpretable and most
parsimonious solution to the data. For this model, entropy was above acceptability
thresholds for both the women and men sample (> 0.70).

Table 3

We first tested invariance of the five-class model item response probabilities
across cohorts. As shown in Table 4, the model was fully invariant for women and
partially invariant for men. We had to free (i.e., let it vary across cohorts) one parameter
before obtaining a model statistically equal to the baseline (p > .05).
Table 5 presents the results of the final five-class model by gender. The numbers
below each subgroup heading (item response probabilities) represent the likelihood that
the participants in each latent class reported exhibiting a specific alcohol use behaviour.
Examination of item response probabilities confirmed the profiles in large part reflected
the drinking statuses found in previous studies1 (e.g., Aresi et al., 2020). Three classes
were confirmed: current non-drinker class (CND), weekend risky (WRD) and weekend
non-risky drinkers (WnRD). However, we found that those characterized by high

14

RUNNING HEAD: LCA ALCOHOL USE COVID-19

probabilities of drinking on all seven days of the week were distinguished into two
subgroups: daily non-risky (DnRD) and daily risky drinkers (DRD), depending on
whether they were likely to report any of the two risky drinking behaviours (i.e., drunk
in the past month or HED).
A one way analysis of variance [F(4, 3,108) = 236.944, p < .001] and post-hoc
analyses showed that DRDs reported the greatest number of alcohol-related negative
consequences as compared to WRDs and the other more moderate drinking patterns,
thus adding to the conceptual validity of the classes (Figure 1).

Table 4
Table 5
Figure 1

Assessing changes in class prevalence across cohorts
We proceeded with the next test to compare class prevalence rates across 2015 and 2020
cohorts, separately by gender. First, we compared the fully constrained model (all
prevalence rates equal across cohorts) to the freely estimated model. Results indicated
non equivalence neither for female (p < 0.01) nor male (p < 0.001) participants. We
then saved participants’ most likely class membership and calculated 2015 and 2020
weighted class prevalence rates, separately by gender. Ninety-five per cent confidence
intervals were used to determine any variation across cohort (Figure 2). Among women,
CNDs substantially increased from 15.5% in 2015 to 23.5% in 2020, whereas WnRDs
decreased from 53.9% to 45.5%. However, prevalence rates of the other three classes
did not vary significantly across cohorts. Similarly, the proportion of men assigned to

15

RUNNING HEAD: LCA ALCOHOL USE COVID-19

the CND class increased from 9.2% in 2015 to 15.7% in 2020, and membership in the
WnRD class decreased from 55.3% to 44.2%. However, there were also differences in
the prevalence of the other three classes. DnRDs decreased by about half from 11.6% to
6.4%, whereas both WRDs and DRDs increased from 15.0% to 21.3% and 8.9% to
12.4%, respectively. Even though the increase in the prevalence of DRDs was not
marked, the absence of overlap among confidence intervals indicates the difference is
significant.

Figure 2

Association between lockdown tiers and latent class membership
Lockdown tier allocation (yellow vs. orange and red tiers where bars and other drinking
venues were closed) was included in the model to test its impact on 2020 class
membership, separately by gender (Table 6). The DRD class was selected as the
reference category because members of this class display the greatest alcohol-related
risk. For both genders, no significant association between latent class membership and
lockdown tiers was found (all ps > .05).

Table 6

Discussion
This study used a person-centred approach to compare patterns of alcohol use among
Italian young adults in 2015 and during the November 2020 COVID-19 lockdown. The
use of LCA to identify subgroups of different patterns of alcohol users allowed us to

16

RUNNING HEAD: LCA ALCOHOL USE COVID-19

simultaneously test the Availability and Stress and Coping hypotheses on the effects of
this pandemic on alcohol use (Rehm et al., 2020). Our findings are broadly consistent
with results of other studies (Busse et al., 2021; Garnett et al., 2021; Sallie et al., 2020)
and indicate there have been changes in the prevalence of drinking patterns before and
during the pandemic, though these changes are different across genders.
Among both men and women, we found substantial increases in the proportion
of individuals who were almost entirely abstaining from alcohol (i.e., Current nondrinkers) paired with decreases in the proportion of those who drink moderately over
the weekend (i.e., Weekend non-risky drinkers). These results offer support to the
Availability hypothesis: it appears reduced opportunities to drink during the lockdown
led to decreases in alcohol use among some members of the general population and
namely among lighter drinkers (Rehm et al., 2020). Contrary to our expectations,
increasingly restrictive lockdown tiers were not associated with increased likelihood to
belong to lighter drinking patterns. We speculate this result may be related to all tiers
being fairly restrictive to the operation of alcohol outlets (i.e., the least restrictive tier
meant drinking outlets would close at 6 p.m.) and by the fact that other sources of
alcoholic beverages (e.g., off-premise and delivery) were easily accessible across all
tiers.
Among men only, our results suggest a polarization effect whereby the
proportion of moderate drinkers (i.e., Weekend and Daily non-risky drinkers) decreased,
whereas the proportion of risky drinkers (i.e., Weekend and Daily risky drinkers)
increased. This result may provide support to a self-medication use of alcohol under the
Stress and Coping hypothesis among a relatively small but more numerous group of
men (Khantzian, 1997). The prevalence of the two profiles characterized by risky

17

RUNNING HEAD: LCA ALCOHOL USE COVID-19

drinking behaviours (i.e., drunk in the past month or HED) increased from 2015 to
during the pandemic in 2020. Importantly, the increase in those drinking on all seven
days of the week and engaging in risky drinking (DRD) is particularly alarming. This
relatively small and high-risk subgroup of drinkers increased by almost 40% from
almost 9 to 12.5 per cent. This group also displayed a disproportionate number of
alcohol-related negative consequences as compared to any other group. Previous studies
have demonstrated that, among young Italians, extending consumption beyond the
typical Thursday – Sunday pattern does not denote problematic alcohol use per se, as it
is in other countries (Aresi et al., 2020; Cleveland et al., 2012; Piumatti et al., 2018).
However, this pattern becomes concerning and is socially censored when paired with
episodes of drunkenness and heavy drinking sessions (Aresi & Pedersen, 2016;
Hoeppner et al., 2012).
Limitations of the current study suggest avenues for future research. First, the
repeated cross-sectional design constrains the interpretation of causal effects nor allows
to determine the direction of the transitions from and to drinking patterns. In addition,
because the two cohorts were five years apart, secular trends of reduced alcohol intake
among young people may at least in part explain the differences we found. Further
longitudinal and mixed-method research is needed to better examine causal
relationships, assess changes in further waves and restrictions, and get a deeper
understanding of these issues. A second limitation is that the present study employed
only self-report measures, which might be susceptible to response bias.

Conclusions and implications for research and practice

18

RUNNING HEAD: LCA ALCOHOL USE COVID-19

This study contributes to the literature on alcohol use during the COVID-19 health
emergency. Results indicate gender-specific changes in the prevalence of the five
drinker profiles. In support to the Availability hypothesis, increases in abstaining women
and men were observed, however among men there were also increases in the
prevalence of patterns characterized by risky drinking and related harm (Stress and
Coping hypothesis). Accordingly, it is important for policy makers, preventive
interventions and health services to focus on the small but significant groups of those
who drink daily and heavily. Finally, we suggest that our study makes an important
methodological contribution to the field. Our use of LCA allowed developing a
multifaceted and thorough portrait of alcohol use patterns during health emergencies.
We recommend LCA as an important tool for future studies in this field.

Notes
1

The four drinking classes were: those who have not been drinking recently (Current

Non-Drinkers - CND), two classes of weekend drinkers distinguished by the probability
of engaging in risky drinking (Weekend Non-Risky Drinkers – WNRD, and Weekend
Risky Drinkers - WRD), and one class of Daily Drinkers (DD).
