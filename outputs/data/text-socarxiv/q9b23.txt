Abstract
Until a vaccine becomes available, a frequently adopted strategy to contain the COVID-19 pandemic
involves three non-pharmaceutical interventions that crucially depend on high adherence in society:
maintaining physical distance from others, minimizing social contacts, and wearing face masks.
These measures require substantial changes in established practices of social interaction, raising
the question of which factors motivate individuals to comply with these preventive behaviours. Using
Austrian panel survey data from April to October 2020 we show that perceived health risks, social
norms, and trust in political institutions stimulate people to engage in preventive behaviour.
Moderation analyses show that the effectiveness of social norms and trust in institutions in facilitating
preventive behaviour increases when people's perceptions of health risks decrease. This result
suggests that trust in institutions and strong social norms play a crucial role in achieving high rates
of preventive behaviour when perceived levels of health risks are low.

“Preventive behaviour”, which mandates physical distancing, wearing a face mask, and minimizing
social contacts, is considered the prime strategy to curb the spread of SARS-CoV2 at least until a
vaccine becomes available(Alwan et al. 2020). While these measures appear effective(Chu et al.
2020; Dehning et al. 2020; Feng et al. 2020; Leung et al. 2020; Mitze et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020),
their impact crucially depends on high rates of adoption in the population(Eikenberry et al. 2020).
Preventive behaviour has a distinct social component, as the measures protect others as well as
oneself(V. C.-C. Cheng et al. 2020; K. K. Cheng, Lam, and Leung 2020; Greenhalgh et al. 2020;
Wise et al. n.d.). Given that such measures demand significant changes in the lifestyle and the
practices of social interaction hitherto perceived as normal(Betsch et al. 2020), it is important to
understand the factors that influence individual willingness to engage in preventive behaviour(Bavel
et al. 2020). Hence, this paper looks at social mechanisms affecting preventive behaviour.
To date, the literature on COVID-19 and previous pandemics has highlighted three main social
mechanisms that facilitate preventive behaviour: people may believe in the existence of a threat and
act in response to their risk perception (Ferrer and Klein 2015), they may adhere to a social norm
(Reid, Cialdini, and Aiken 2010), or they may act out of trust in the institutions responsible for
containing the pandemic (Devine et al. 2020). First, a concern about health risks (Harper et al. 2020;
Tannenbaum et al. 2015; Wise et al. n.d.), irrespective of whether concerns relate to one’s own or
others’ vulnerability to an infection with SARS-CoV2 (Clark et al. 2020), can induce preventive
behaviour (Díaz and Cova 2020). Second, social norms refer to mutually expected behaviour (Opp
2015). People may engage in preventive behaviour not because of their own belief in the benefit of
the behaviour itself, but because they care about their social relations and their reputation in their
social environment (Carbon 2020; Diekmann et al. 2014; Horne 2007; Simpson and Willer 2015).
Third, trust in authorities and legal measures may promote human behaviour in line with government
recommendations (Engel 2008; Tyler 2013). Low levels of trust undermine governments’ capabilities
to enact controversial policies (Hetherington 2007) and decrease compliance (Marien and Hooghe
2011). Hence, trust in authorities and institutions facilitates compliance with measures to contain the
pandemic such as preventive behaviour (Devine et al. 2020; Nivette et al. 2021).
We argue that, though these three factors represent distinct mechanisms, their effects on preventive
behaviour are not independent of each other. Cognitive sociology (Lindenberg 2013) provides a
useful theoretical framework for systematizing the motivations for preventive behaviour. Central to
this framework is the distinction between the hedonic, gain and normative goal frames that “influence
what people think of at the moment, what information they are sensitive to, what action alternatives
they perceive, and how they will act” (Lindenberg and Steg 2007:119). This approach has, for
example, been successfully applied to explain pro-environmental behaviour (Steg and Vlek 2009).
Health risks in a pandemic generate externalities to human behaviour that form public good dilemmas
structurally similar to environmental issues (Karlsson and Rowlett 2020). Using this framework, the
threat of COVID-19 can be understood as an exogenous shock that disrupts people’s hedonic
routines. This shock activates people’s self-regarding motives. Given that health is a core interest
(Lindenberg 2013), people who are concerned about their health do not need further inducement to
take measures to avoid infection. However, when people do not perceive the pandemic as a health
threat, they may nevertheless engage in preventive behaviour because they believe it is appropriate,
either for normative reasons (Opp 2013, 2017) or because they trust in the adequacy of policies
developed by authorities (Hetherington 1998; Intawan and Nicholson 2018). Therefore, the effects of
social norms and trust in institutions should depend on the perception of health risk, that is, their
effects should decline as the perception of health risks increases.
These arguments lead to the following hypotheses: The larger the concern about health risks (H1) /
the perception of a social norm of preventive behaviour (H2) / trust in institutions (H3), the more likely

2

is preventive behaviour. The smaller the concern about health risks, the stronger the effect of social
norms (H4) and of trust in institutions (H5) on adherence to preventive behaviour.
To test these hypotheses, we use panel survey data from a representative sample of the Austrian
population gathered in six waves between April and October 2020. We analyse fixed-effects
regression models for an index of preventive behaviour based on respondents’ self-reported
likelihood to stay at home, wear masks and keep physical distance to others (see Methods).
Together, these measures are considered essential individual contributions to governmental efforts
to curb the pandemic, which may contribute to avoiding more severe measures such as the closing
of infrastructure (commerce, schools) or regional or nationwide “lockdowns”.
Results
Figure 1 relates the evolution of preventive behaviour, perceptions of health risks, perceived social
norms, and trust in institutions to the development of the pandemic over time. At the outset of the
crisis, average adherence to preventive behaviour reached its maximum (.84; 95% CI [.83, .85]) to
date on an index ranging 0 – 1 and then gradually declined following the reduction in the number of
infections until it reached a minimum (.61; 95% CI [.59, .62]) in August. Similarly, average perceptions
of health risks declined during spring 2020 (April: .51; 95% CI [.50, 52], June: .35; 95% CI [.33, .36])
and later rose in line with the incidence of infections (October: .48; 95% CI [.47, .50]). Also, the
perception of a social norm of preventive behaviour, i.e. individual perceptions that others are
adopting preventive behaviour and think that this is the right thing to do, continuously declined during
spring 2020 (April: .67; 95% CI [.66, .68], June: .39; 95% CI [.38, .41]). After remaining on a low level
over the summer, it slightly increased in the autumn (October: .45; 95% CI [.44, .47]). Trust in
institutions also started at a high level (April: .68; 95% CI [.67, .70]) and exhibited a gradual decline
during the crisis (June: .61; 95% CI [.59, .62]), but differed from the other indicators in that it remained
at low levels as the number of weekly infections started to rise in August and picked up pace in
September and October 2020 (.60; 95% CI [.58, .61]). Overall, the increase in infections from the end
of the summer onwards did not trigger a behavioural response in the population as strongly as it did
early in the pandemic.

relaxation of government measures. Each line displays the weighted values of corresponding normalised
additive indices. Whiskers indicate 95% confidence intervals. (See Methods for detailed descriptions on these
variables and SOM for descriptive statistics and question wordings).

While these observations indicate that, on average, perceptions of health risks, social norm
perceptions and, to a lesser degree, trust in institutions changed in synchronicity, these variables are
also cross-sectionally associated with preventive behaviour (Figure 2). Averaging over waves and
respondents, we observe that respondents who perceive the health risks to be high exhibit a value
of .79 (95% CI [.78, .80]) on our 0 – 1 scale of preventive behaviour, compared to .59 (95% CI [.57,
.60]) if they perceive the risks to be low (t = 28.9, p < .001, two-tailed). At the same time, preventive
behaviour also increases with rising levels of respondents’ perceived social norm (high = .84 (95%
CI [.83, .85]); low = .54 (95% CI [.53, .55]); t = 44.1, p<.001, two-tailed) and trust in institutions (high
= .78 (95% CI [.77, .79]); low = .60, (95% CI [.58, .61]); t = 24.5, p < .001, two-tailed). However, the
sizes of these associations substantially decrease when respondents perceive health risks to be high
(social norm =.17 (95% CI [.14, .19]), trust in institution =.20 (95% CI [.18, .23])) compared to when
they perceive them to be low (social norm =.35 (95% CI [.33, .38]), trust in institution =.10 (95% CI
[.07, .12])).

Figure 2: Evolution of preventive behaviour by different tertiles of perceived health risks, perceived social norm
and trust in institutions (N=6063 obs. of 1708 individuals). SN = Perceived social norms; TI = Trust in
institutions. Whiskers indicate 95% confidence intervals. Level of predictors (1st, 2nd, and 3rd tertile) are
calculated using within wave tertiles, each containing one third of our observations per wave. Low, medium
and high perceived risk levels are calculated using overall perceived risk tertiles. (See Methods for detailed
descriptions on these variables).

To test whether these associations also hold when accounting for potential confounding factors due
to changing conditions between waves (e.g. because of changing governmental measures), as well
as controlling for varying employment conditions (e.g. home office), we next focus on the results of
4

linear regression models (see Methods). The baseline model (Model 1 in Table 1) tests the effects of
perceived health risks, social norms and trust in institutions on preventive behaviour. It shows that
an increase in perceived health risks corresponds to an increase in individual preventive behaviour,
supporting H1. Similarly, the perception of social norms is positively associated with preventive
behaviour in line with H2, as is trust in institutions in line with H3. Model 2 includes interaction terms
to test whether the effect of social norms and the effect of trust in institutions depend on the level of
perceived health risks. All coefficients show effects in the expected direction, indicating higher effects
of perceived social norms and trust in institutions when perceived health risks are low. Model 3
presents estimates from a two-way fixed effects panel regression that additionally accounts for
unobserved heterogeneity that is constant within individuals in the observed period. Although the
focus on within-individual variation decreases coefficient sizes, the estimates generally support the
results of the OLS with wave fixed effects. Model 4 additionally controls for the local infection rate
that might explain risk perceptions as well as adoption of preventive behaviour by including the 7day incidence rate on the regional level (see Methods). Estimates in Table 1 indicate that including
this macro-level indicator is statistically insignificant, marginal in size, and has nearly no effect on the
coefficients of the other variables in the model (β = .006, t = 2.03, p = .112; 95% CI [-.002, .014]. The
coefficient implies that a tenfold increase in the regional incidence rate would increase preventive
behaviour by .01). To interpret the significance and assess the strength and relevancy of the
estimated effects of perceived risk, social norms, and trust in institutions on preventive behaviour, we
next focus on marginal effects plots (Brambor, Clark, and Golder 2006).

Table 1. Preventive behaviour: OLS regression estimates. Controls for changes in employment situation, as
well as perceived effectiveness of measures. Robust standard errors in parentheses are clustered by wave
and individuals (Models 1-3) or by wave, individuals, and region (Model 4). The estimates are robust against

5

the inclusion of further controls, alternative specifications of the link function (fractional model) and against
alternative assumptions about the data structure (tobit). For details refer to Methods. Full estimates are
provided in the supplementary online appendix (AT1).

Figure 3 shows the effect of social norm perception on preventive behaviour for low, medium and
high levels of health risk perception. Holding other variables at their means and focusing on a medium
level of risk, a one within-individual standard deviation increase in the perceived level of social norms
from the mean is associated with a .06 (z=22.07, p < .001; 95% CI [.05, .06]) increase in preventive
behaviour. Relative to the observed within-individual standard deviation in preventive behaviour
(henceforth called SD), this amounts to a .41 SD increase (z=22.07, p < .001; 95% CI [.38, .45]),
which is a moderately strong effect.

Figure 3: Linear prediction of preventive behaviour by perceived social norm conditional on the level of
perceived health risks. Predictions based on estimates in model 3 in Table 1. Linear Fixed Effects model with
wave as well as individual fixed effects. 95% confidence intervals (grey areas) are calculated using two-way
clustered standard errors for individuals and waves. The histogram represents the distribution of social norm
perceptions in the sample. Dashed lines mark +/- one within-individual SD from the mean.

As Figure 3 shows, the size of this effect (indicated by the gradient of the lines) depends on the level
of individually perceived health risks. More important than the overall effect of perceived health risks
(.08 SD at the mean; z=3.07, p = .002; 95% CI [.03, .13]) is the finding that the risk level moderates
the size of the effect of perceived social norms. Focusing on empirically observed points that have a
high probability of occurring in the distribution of perceived risk in our sample, we observe effect sizes
of .47 (z=21.84, p < .001; 95% CI [.42, .51]) SD and .36 (z=19.69, p < .001; 95% CI [.32, .39]) SD,
respectively, for one standard deviation below and above the mean. Hence, the effect size of social
6

norms decreases by .05 SD for a one SD increase in perceived health risks or, in relative terms,
decreases by 23% when individually perceived health risks shift from moderately low to moderately
high levels. This difference in the average marginal effects (AMEs) is highly significant according to
a Wald test (-.11 SD, p < .001, 95% CI [-.13, -.08]), which provides strong evidence that smaller
individual concerns about health risks imply a larger effect of social norms on preventive behaviour,
supporting H4.

Figure 4: 2FE linear regression linear prediction of preventive behaviour by trust in institutions conditional on
the level of perceived health risks. Predictions based on estimates in model 3 in Table 1. Linear Fixed Effects
model with wave as well as individual fixed effects. 95% confidence intervals (grey areas) are calculated
using two-way clustered standard errors for individuals and waves. The histogram represents the distribution
of social norm perceptions in the sample. Dashed lines mark +/- one within-individual SD from the mean.

Figure 4 shows that, similar to the results on social norms, a rise in the level of trust in institutions
increases preventive behaviour. Holding other variables at their means, a one standard deviation
increase from the mean in trust in institutions is associated with a .05 SD (z=3.14, p = .002; 95% CI
[.02, .08]) increase in preventive behaviour. Thus, while statistically significant, the effect of trust at
mean levels of perceived risks is comparatively small. This results not only from the smaller size of
the coefficients but also from the smaller amount of within-individual variation in trust in institutions
(.09 compared to .14 in social norms and .13 in perceived risk). Thus, the small effect size also results
from the fact that trust in institutions tends to be more stable within individuals than social norm
perceptions. However, this should not hide the relevance of trust for differentiating individual
preventive behaviour over time. Focusing again on relevant points in the distribution of perceived
health risks, i.e. one standard deviation below and above the mean, effect sizes are .07 SD (z=3.32,

7

p < .001; 95% CI [.03, .11]) and .03 SD (z=2.39, p = .017; 95% CI [.01, .05]), respectively. Hence the
size of the effect of trust in institutions on preventive behaviour decreases by .02 SD for a one SD
increase in perceived risks or, in relative terms, decreases by 60% if one moves from moderately low
to moderately high levels of perceived health risks. This difference in the AMEs is again highly
significant according to a Wald test (-.04 SD, p = .002, 95% CI [-.07, -.01]), which provides evidence
in line with H5 that smaller perceived health risks lead to a larger effect of trust in institutions on
preventive behaviour.
Discussion
We used individual-level panel data from Austria spanning nearly the full duration of the COVID-19
pandemic so far to analyse three factors promoting preventive behaviour: perceived health risks,
social norms, and trust in institutions. We found that, on average, people with lower health risk
perceptions, those who perceive less of a social norm of preventive behaviour among others, and
those who have lower levels of trust in institutions responsible for dealing with the crisis, are less
likely to adopt preventive behaviour. Moreover, we found that these effects are not independent from
each other: declining levels of perceived health risks increase the relevance of social norms and trust
in facilitating preventive behaviour. Fixed-effects regressions focusing on variation within individuals
support these results and suggest that the moderately strong effect of social norms (.41 SD) and the
small effect of trust in institutions (.05 SD) decrease by 23% and 60%, respectively, when risk
perceptions increase from moderately low to moderately high levels (one within-individual standard
deviation below and above the mean). These results are robust against alternative specifications of
the link function and against alternative assumptions about the data structure (see Methods).
Our study applied a theoretical framework that highlights the mutually reinforcing nature of human
behaviour (Lindenberg 2013), which is a crucial element of preventive behaviour in public health
contexts. This approach recognizes that, in most cases, preventive behaviour mainly benefits others
(V. C.-C. Cheng et al. 2020; K. K. Cheng et al. 2020; Greenhalgh et al. 2020; Wise et al. n.d.), while
its costs are primarily borne by the individual. In line with results of previous studies on norm-violating
behaviour (Keizer, Lindenberg, and Steg 2008), our results highlight the potential of social norms and
trust in institutions to overcome the public goods dilemma inherent in preventive behaviour: In a
positive feedback loop, an uptake of preventive behaviour induces similar behaviour among others.
This result relates to expectations of conditional cooperation (Axelrod and Hamilton 1981; Fehr and
Gintis 2007) and research that highlights people’s concern about their reputation (Simpson and Willer
2015). Empirical evidence in the context of COVID-19 suggests that wearing masks and maintaining
distance is linked to higher empathy and prosociality (Pfattheicher et al. 2020): People who engage
in preventive behaviour are perceived as more prosocial, and, in turn, these people express less
positive attitudes towards those not wearing masks (Betsch et al. 2020). Furthermore, social peer
pressure is an important predictor of preventive behaviour (Nivette et al. 2021) and people feel less
strange wearing masks when amongst other people wearing masks (Carbon 2020).
Low levels of trust undermine governments’ capabilities to enact controversial policies (Hetherington
2007) and decrease compliance (Marien and Hooghe 2011). This relates to another main finding of
our study: when people trust the institutions that are responsible for managing the pandemic,
measures enacted by these institutions can reach higher levels of acceptance, which is in line with
recent empirical evidence on preventive behaviour during the current and previous pandemics (Blair,
Morse, and Tsai 2017; Devine et al. 2020; Morse et al. 2016; Nivette et al. 2021; Siegrist and Zingg
2014). Additionally, it has been shown that mandatory preventive measures are perceived as more
effective, fair, and socially responsible than reliance on voluntary preventive behaviour (Betsch et al.
2020).

Similar to other empirical results in the context of COVID-19 (Harper et al. 2020; Wise et al. n.d.) and
of previous pandemics (Lau et al. 2007; Maughan-Brown and Venkataramani 2018), our findings
show that the perception of health risks is an important factor explaining individual adherence to
preventive behaviour. However, this does not imply that health risks are unimportant, but rather
suggests that successful prevention strategies do not depend on high risk perceptions. This finding
relates to studies suggesting that social mechanisms facilitating preventive behaviour should become
stronger as levels of individually perceived health risks decrease (Jørgensen, Bor, and Petersen
2020).
Our finding that perceived health risks function as an important moderator of other factors facilitating
preventive behaviour also raises implications for policy making and may help to understand varying
results in the wider field of research on health behaviour: the role of risk perceptions as an important
moderator may explain inconsistent results on the benefits of health messages in facilitating
preventive behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic (Bilancini et al. 2020; Capraro and Barcelo
2020; Everett et al. 2020; Heffner, Vives, and FeldmanHall 2021; Jordan, Yoeli, and Rand 2020).
This implies that, while interventions aimed at raising individual risk perceptions may boost preventive
behaviour in the short term, they may lower the potentials of other measures aiming to foster
preventive behaviour in the long term.
Besides health risks, social norms, and trust, previous studies highlighted several other factors
affecting preventive behaviour. Empirical results from the US indicate that health risk perceptions
may be biased by the selective reception of media reports, as suggested by the theory of political
reasoning (Rothgerber et al. 2020). These risk perceptions in turn affect preventive behaviour.
Further, endorsement of preventive behaviour can depend on personality traits such as psychological
entitlement (Zitek and Schlund 2020) or agreeableness and conscientiousness (Blagov 2020). As
our study relies on within-individual variation, factors such as party affiliation and relatively stable
long-term personality traits should not bias our estimates. However, we also tested whether
accounting for party affiliation changes the estimates reported in Model 2 in Table 1. We found no
effects on preventive behaviour and including party affiliation did not substantially change the
coefficients of our main variables, which suggests that, regarding preventive behaviour, party
affiliation may be less important in Austria (see Appendix A1).
Another factor frequently highlighted in the literature is self-efficacy: people are more likely to behave
in accordance with measures if they assume effectiveness (Rogers 1975) and performability (Maddux
and Rogers 1983). This has also been shown in the context of COVID-19 (Jørgensen et al. 2020).
To account for the fact that different beliefs about the effectiveness of COVID-19 measures might
confound our estimates, we control for individuals’ perceived effectiveness of measures in general.
These remain insignificant in all our analyses (see Appendix A1). However, as this captures only one
aspect of the concept of self-efficacy, we cannot exclude the possibility that other dimensions of selfefficacy affect preventive behaviour.
The ACPP dataset consists of individual-level data allowing us to move beyond the aggregate
analysis of behavioural change during the COVID-19 crisis (Haug et al. 2020; Jay et al. 2020). It
enables us to test individual-level mechanisms and avoid ecological fallacies. However, because we
cannot directly observe behaviour, we rely on self-reported behaviour. While this represents a
limitation of our study, our estimation approach limits the potential of biases in our results. Since we
rely on within-individual variation to test the hypotheses, using self-reported data instead of data on
actual behaviour could only bias our estimates if changes in individual reported behaviour do not
relate to changes in actual behaviour. This should minimize the impact of social desirability bias.
Moreover, recent empirical studies suggest that estimates of compliance with COVID-19 regulations
do not suffer from social desirability tendencies (Jensen 2020; Larsen, Nyrup, and Petersen 2020).

To test whether our data reflects macro-level behavioural changes in Austria, we compare the
propensity of staying at home, which is the dimension of our preventive behaviour measure that most
closely measures actual mobility, with macro data of mobility patterns provided by Google (Google
2020). We find that our estimates follow average patterns quite well (see Appendix A3). Moreover,
we validate these results with other sources that provide aggregated mobility estimates in Austria
(Heiler et al. 2020) and again find patterns of change over time similar to our survey estimates. This
corroborates results from another study that uses micro data and finds that the reported times people
spend outside seem to be externally valid when checked against mobile phone data (Kitamura and
Yamada 2020).
Austria is a country that had fewer infections per capita in the first wave compared to other countries
in the region but seems to be dealing less well with the second rise of infections in the autumn of
2020 (Johns Hopkins University 2020). While our data is limited to this national context, our study
has distinct advantages over some international comparative studies used in the literature. First, it
does not rely on convenience samples often used to get fast and easy access to respondents in a
wide array of countries. Second, the use of panel data over an extended period of time allows to
focus on variation within individuals and hence render constant characteristics that may confound
the results irrelevant. Furthermore, the available literature so far has shown that risk perception
correlates with health behaviour in a wide range of countries (Dryhurst et al. 2020) and that national
contexts change little in the effect of individually perceived knowledge efficacy, interpersonal trust,
and trust in institutions on preventive behaviour (Jørgensen et al. 2020).
In view of the importance of preventive behaviour for curbing infection rates and the high demands it
puts on individuals to change common practices of social interaction, it is crucial to provide evidence
on the heterogeneous factors that promote preventive behaviour (Bavel et al. 2020; Clark et al. 2020).
As long as physical distancing, minimizing social contacts and wearing masks are the main strategies
for disrupting infection chains, the results of this study suggest that two levers may facilitate
preventive behaviour, especially in contexts of decreasing perceptions of health risks: At the societal
level, institutions responsible for dealing with the crisis need to maintain and build up support, for
example by transparent communication (Bles et al. 2020; Renn, Levine, and Kasperson 1991) and
exemplary behaviour of officials in line with governmental regulations (Fancourt, Steptoe, and Wright
2020). At the individual level, role models of compliant behaviour support the development of social
norms that facilitate compliance with pandemic response strategies (Habersaat et al. 2020; Kitamura
and Yamada 2020).

Methods
Data
The data comprises the five waves (waves 3, 7, 11, 14, and 16) of the Austrian Corona Panel Project
(ACPP) (Kittel et al. 2020a) that included questions on preventive behaviour and social norms. The
observed period ranges from mid-April until mid-October 2020. This includes parts of the first COVID19 induced lockdown in Austria as well as the successive periods of relaxation and re-intensification
of infections and government measures in Austria. The ACPP is carrying out an online panel survey
representative of the Austrian population with N = 1500, which is administered by a market research
company. Details on the research design, panel attrition, as well as on the quota sampling that
matches the Austrian population in terms of sociodemographic characteristics such as gender, age,
education, employment status, migration background and region, are documented elsewhere (Kittel
et al. 2020b). The panel study is still ongoing, and we use the latest data containing the survey

10

modules relevant for the present analysis that are available at the moment of writing this study.
However, results remain substantially similar if we do not use the full sample available (see Appendix
A3).
Operationalization
We operationalize the dependent variable, preventive behaviour, by means of a normalized additive
index comprising three variables: (i) self-reported frequency of staying at home except for
necessities, (ii) self-reported frequency of keeping a distance of at least one meter from others, and
(iii) self-reported frequency of wearing a mask whenever physical distancing is not possible, with all
items measured by a five-level Likert scale ranging from “fully agree” to “do not agree at all”.
Cronbach’s alpha for this index is .69. To test whether the use of separate dimensions instead of an
index of preventive behaviour would have altered our results, we provide regression estimates using
the separate dimensions for each of the variables underlying the index of preventive behaviour as
dependent variables in the supplementary online appendix (OA3). These results indicate that there
are no substantial differences in direction and size of the effects of our main independent variables
compared to the index of preventive behaviour.
The independent variables we use to test our hypotheses comprise (1) perceptions of health risks
coming from COVID-19, (2) social norms, and (3) trust in institutions. Again, we operationalize these
three aspects through normalized additive indices based on 5-level (1,2) and 11-level (3) Likert
scales:
(1) The index of perceived health risks is based on respondents’ assessments of (i) the health risks
COVID-19 entails for themselves and (ii) for the Austrian population in general. Cronbach’s alpha for
this index is .77.
(2) The index of social norms consists of (i) descriptive norms and (ii) injunctive norms regarding
preventive behaviour. Descriptive norms refer to perceptions of other people's behaviour, while
injunctive norms refer to beliefs about other people's opinions (Cialdini et al. 2006; Cialdini, Reno,
and Kallgren 1990; Schultz 1999; Schultz, Khazian, and Zaleski 2008). As with the dependent
variable index, the social norms index includes variables on descriptive and injunctive norms
regarding staying at home except for necessities, keeping a distance of at least one meter, and
wearing a mask when physical distancing is not possible. Cronbach’s alpha for this index is .83.
(3) The index on trust in institutions consists of items on trust in four public institutions: (i) the
government, (ii) the health care system, (iii) the parliament, and (iv) the police. Cronbach’s alpha for
this index is .88. For all indices, the results of the corresponding principal component analyses and
the correlation of the relevant components to the additive indices can be found in the supplementary
online appendix (OA4).
We control for individuals’ perceived effectiveness of governmental measures. Furthermore, we
control for the sociodemographic characteristics of gender, age, education, household size, migration
background and employment status. Employment status is also included in the FE-regressions and
contains a dummy for flexible work arrangements (home office), which has been recommended as a
means of social distancing (Papageorge et al. 2020). We recoded all variables in a way that aligns
the direction and range of the scales (normalization), thus easing comparability. Hence, every
variable ranges from 0 to 1, whereby 0 indicates the lowest and 1 the highest value of the
corresponding concept (i.e. frequency, trust, agreement to statements, estimations of opinions and
behaviour). The exact wording of all questions and the corresponding answer options in German as
well as their translation into English can be found in the supplementary online appendix (OA6).
Furthermore, we provide basic descriptive statistics of all variables used in the analyses in the
supplementary online appendix (OA1).

In the five waves, a total of 2,414 individuals, including replacements for panel attrition, participated
in the survey. Listwise deletion of missing values reduces the number of respondents to 2,168.
Because we focus on variation within individuals, we further reduce our sample to respondents who
participated in at least two of the aforementioned waves, which results in 1,708 individuals, providing
a total of 6,063 observations. We provide balance checks on these samples in the supplementary
online appendix (OA5). These results show that those who dropped out are on average more likely
to be female, younger, less educated and from larger households. However, with the exception of
age, these effects are marginal in size. To avoid confounding by important socio-demographic
characteristics like age (which may explain perceived risk as well as preventive behaviour), we rely
on within-individual variation in our main analyses. Crucially, those remaining in the sample are quite
similar to those who dropped out with regard to the attitudes, perceptions and behaviours appearing
in our main hypotheses. We do not drop eight participants (0.47%) who reported a constant value on
the preventive behaviour index over all waves, thus providing no information for the FE analysis.
Statistical Model
We use a two-way fixed-effects (2FE) panel model in order to avoid confounding by unobserved
heterogeneity within individuals. Replacing individual fixed effects with time-invariant sociodemographic characteristics does not alter our substantive results for the variables of interest
reported in the main analyses. This holds also true if we add further sociodemographic controls
(appendix A1 model 3). Because the dependent variable is censored at 0 and 1 by our normalization,
we compare the linear approximation to a fractional probit model. Furthermore, we also compare our
results to a tobit model. Because our estimates could be biased by truncation of the Likert scale
measuring the three dimensions of preventive behaviour analysed here, a tobit model may be more
appropriate. However, both fractional probit as well as tobit models yield potentially inconsistent
estimators in FE models, especially in unbalanced panels with small T (Greene 2004; Papke and
Wooldridge 2008). Thus, we opted to use standard linear two-way fixed effect models in our main
analyses. However, we also provide regression estimates of both the tobit and the fractional model
in the appendix (A1). These models do not yield substantially different results.
As suggested in the literature, we test whether the hypothesized moderations can be approximated
by a linear interaction (see appendix A2) (Hainmueller, Mummolo, and Xu 2019). Wald tests provide
p-values of 0.19 (social norms) and 0.33 (trust in institutions), showing that we cannot reject the
NULL-hypothesis that the point estimates of the binning estimators used to test the moderations at
important points in the distribution of the moderator (perceived health risks) are statistically equivalent
to linear interaction models. Hence, we conclude that assuming linear interactions is valid in our case.
Furthermore, we explore the plausibility of the parallel trends assumption, immanent in analyses
using twoway fixed effects estimators (Angrist and Pischke 2008). We show that our results remain
essentially robust after the inclusion of leads of the main variables analysed here and only slightly
decrease in size if we add individual specific wave trends (see supplementary online appendix OA2).

Table AT1: Full regression estimates: wave Fixed Effects (1, 2, 3), two-way Fixed Effects (4, 5), Fractional Model (6), and
Tobit regression (7). Model (4) is the main model. Generally, models (1, 2, 4, 5) are equivalent to models (1, 2, 3, 4) in
Table 1. Standard errors in parenthesis (+ p < .10; * p < .05; ** p < .01; *** p < .001).

A2. Check linearity of moderations
We apply a binning estimator to check whether the multiplicative interactions of risk perceptions on
the one hand and trust in institutions or social norms on the other hand are linear. The analyses were
carried out by the STATA command interflex (Hainmueller et al. 2019). As suggested there, we use
three bins at a low, medium, and high level of the moderator (median values of tertiles of perceived
health risks). As figures AF1 and AF2 show, the binning estimator of in all points of both interactions
remain quite close to the prediction of a linear interaction. Wald tests provide p-values of 0.19 (social
norms) and 0.33 (trust in institutions), showing that we cannot reject the NULL-hypothesis that the
binning estimator is statistically equivalent to the linear interaction model. Hence, we conclude that
assuming linear interactions is valid in our case.

Figure AF1: Marginal effect of social norms on preventive behaviour, moderated by perceived health risks. Point
estimates show results of a binning estimator + 95% CI on important points in the distribution (the median values of the
tertiles of the moderator variable). The histogram shows the distribution of perceived health risks in our sample. The
regression includes all variables of model 3 in Table 1 in the main text. Linear Fixed Effects model with wave as well as
individual fixed effects. 95% confidence intervals (grey areas) are calculated using individually clustered standard errors

A3. Check robustness of moderation against sample restrictions
To show the robustness of our estimates regarding sample restrictions we re-run the full model
excluding all observations of one wave at a time. This also tests whether our results depend on one
outlying wave, which would suggest that the observed relationships are not stable over time but rather
depend on specific circumstances. Figures AF3 and AF4 demonstrate that the size and direction of
the moderation of social norms as well as trust in institutions by perceived health risks is not
substantially affected by this exercise. Focusing again on the relative change in the size of the effects
of social norms and trust in institutions from moderately low to moderately high levels of perceived
risks (one within standard deviation above and below the mean) we find that increasing levels of risk
reduce the effect of social norms by 21% – 25% (full sample: 23%) and reduces the effect of trust in
institutions by 55% – 67% (full sample: 60%). In sum, excluding specific waves from our analysis
changes little in the results suggesting that the findings are robust to sample restrictions and do not
depend on single wave outliers.

A4. Comparison of survey and mobile data

Figure AF5: Evolution of staying home (agreement to the statement “stay at home except for necessities” measured by a
5-level Likert scale ranging from “almost never” to “almost always”), the Google mobility index, and mobility data from
CSH (Complexity Science Hub Vienna) over the course of the pandemic. Note: “Staying at home” is one of three
dimensions of the preventive behaviour index used in the main analyses (see Methods and SOA). Google COVID-19
Community Mobility Reports are publicly available at (Google 2020). Our google mobility measure is a summarised index
of movement pattern changes in retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, transit stations, workplaces, and residential
areas (reversed) per week. The numbers reflect relative changes compared to the baseline measure: the average
movement in the first week of the google dataset (week 6 of 2020). The CSH mobility averages are an updated version of
Figure 4 Panel A in (Heiler et al. 2020).1 The indices indicate the share of mobile phone devices with a ROG (radius of
gyration) between 0 and 500 meters in Austria per week. Thus, the CSH mobility, approximates the share of people with
relatively low amount movement in Austria.

OA2. Parallel trends assumption
The following table (OAT2) provides the information for assessing the plausibility of the parallel trends
assumption, immanent in analyses using two way fixed effects estimators(Angrist and Pischke 2008).
First, we add a lead on the effect of the three independent variables perceived health risks, social
norms and trust in institutions (model 2) and compare it to our main results (model 1). All three leads
are insignificant and marginal in size, which is in line with the parallel trends assumption. Second, we
additionally include individual-specific time trends (model 3). As the table shows, the sizes of the
coefficients decrease slightly compared to our main model (1) but remain substantial in size,
especially in the case of social norms. This again provides evidence that the parallel trends
assumption is plausible. Although the effects of trust in institutions and its interaction with perceived
health risks loses statistical significance, we argue that this is not clear evidence that the variable
does not affect preventive behaviour but rather emphasizes the smaller size of the effects of trust in
comparison to social norms. In line with this interpretation, the coefficients of social norms and trust
in institutions decrease by quite similar amounts if we restrict the variance these variables can explain
by including unit-specific wave trends.

OA3. Single regressions: aspects of preventive behaviour (staying home,
wearing masks, keeping distance)
The following table (OAT3) provides separate wave fixed effects and two-way fixed effects regression
estimates for each of the variables underlying the preventive behaviour index (staying home, wearing
mask, and keeping distance). Each of these regressions on the single aspects of preventive
behaviour includes sub-indices of the corresponding descriptive and injunctive norms and is
estimated in the same way as the main regression models (Table 1 Model 2 and 3). Generally, the
main variables remain robust in size and significance and always have the expected direction. The
interactions of trust in institutions and perceived health risks remain robust in size as well.

Table OAT3: Results of different regression models (wave Fixed Effects and two-way Fixed Effects) focusing on the
single behavioural variables underlying the preventive behavior index: Staying home (1, 2), wearing mask (3, 4) and
keeping distance (5, 6). Each regression includes sub-indices of descriptive and injunctive norms (Norms: staying home;
Norms: wearing mask; Norms: keeping distance) corresponding to each dependent variable. Standard errors in
parenthesis (+ p < .10; * p < .05; ** p < .01; *** p < .001).

OA4. Indices
To operationalize the core variables, we use additive indices. For better comparison, these indices
have been normalised so that each ranges from 0 – 1. We also studied principal components
analyses (PCAs) for every set of variables underlying the indices, and calculated correlation
coefficients between the first components and the additive indices to check validity. The results are
discussed in the following.
Preventive behaviour (DV)
A PCA shows that one component is sufficient to condense the three underlying variables staying at
home except for necessities, keeping distance of at least 1 meter, and wearing masks whenever
distance cannot be maintained (see Figure OAF1). The first component loads all three variables
rather equally (see Table OAT4), and the correlation coefficient with the additive index is 0.91.

Trust in institutions (IV)
According to the PCA, one component is also sufficient to aggregate the four variables trust in the
government, trust in the health care system, trust in the parliament, and trust in the police (see
Figure OAF2). The first component loads rather equally on all underlying variables (see Table
OAT5) and the correlation coefficient with the additive index is 0.91. As a side remark, the items on
trust in public institutions have not been asked in wave three. To provide a continuous picture, we
imputed the values for this wave as the means of the waves two and four.

29

Social norms (IV)
As in the above cases, a PCA shows that one component is sufficient to combine the underlying
variables on descriptive and injunctive norms (see Figure OAF3). The single norm items cover the
same aspects as in the dependent variable: staying at home except for necessities, keeping
distance of at least 1 meter, and wearing a mask whenever distance cannot be maintained. The
first component once again loads all underlying variables rather equally (see Table OAT6), and the
correlation coefficient with the additive index is 0.85.

Health risks (IV)
According to the PCA, one component suffices to represent the two underlying variables perceived
personal health risk and perceived public health risk (see Figure OAF4). The first component loads
both variables equally (see Table OAT6). The correlation coefficient with the additive index is 0.91.

OA5. Balance checks of data
To examine possible differences between cases included and cases excluded from the analyses
because of missing values, we performed balance checks comprising t-tests (differences in means
between kept and dropped observations) for the dependent and independent variables as well as
sociodemographic characteristics (see table OAT7 below). The tests were conducted in STATA by
the ietoolkit (https://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/ie-analytics-introducing-ietoolkit). See
the STATA code provided online for further details (https://osf.io/qybr5/TODO).

Table OAT7 Balance checks between kept and dropped observations of the dependent, independent and control
variables. The value displayed for t-tests are the differences in the means across the groups. Standard errors are
clustered at participant level. Fixed effects using survey waves are included in all estimated t-tests. Number of clusters
and standard errors in parentheses (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001).

For the main dependent and independent variables in our analyses, we find only one significant
deviation between kept and dropped observations: For kept observations, the index of trust in
institutions has a slightly higher mean than for dropped observations. However, this effect is rather
small, which suggests that this should not substantially affect our regression estimates. Most
differences in sociodemographic characteristics are quite small as well. The only exception here is
age: In the sample, young participants dropped out significantly more often because of missing
values. This is relevant on a descriptive layer but should not have any repercussions on the
interpretation of our results, as these variables do not change in the time span of this study and thus
drop out in the regressions including individual fixed effects.
