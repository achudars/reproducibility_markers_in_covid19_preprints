The impacts of covid-19 on Indonesian poverty and unemployment
Bahri, Muhamad1
Abstract
This study estimates the negative impacts of the COVID-19 on poverty and unemployment
in Indonesia. In doing so, this study develops and uses the SD model that reproduced similar
patterns in terms of GDP, poverty, and unemployment. Estimated unemployment and estimated
poverty under the COVID-19 are calculated for three different economic scenarios: the
optimistic, the mid, and the pessimistic scenarios. This study concludes that Indonesia will
experience rising unemployment and poverty in ranges (9-10) and (25-26) million people
respectively by the end of this year – depending on projected economy growths. This study
suggests that existing financial aids are sufficient to support rising unemployment and rising
poverty level. However, if the Indonesia government cannot carefully slow the COVID-19
flow, higher financial supports are required to curb the negative impacts of the COVID-19.

Introduction
The COVID-19 has affected almost all countries in all continents across the world. Despite
low fatality rates, the negative impacts have reached large-scale socioeconomic impacts such
as low employment and possible economic recessions. In reality, regardless of country income,
all countries have struggled to escape from the COVID-19 impacts. Recently, despite lower
infection rates upon preparedness of more open social and economic activities, the possible
second waves have shadowed policymakers. Although some countries have slowed the
COVID-19 flow, those affected countries have struggled to curb the negative impacts of the
COVID-19.
As one of the emerging markets, Indonesia has attempted to properly handle the pandemic
through some policies such as the social restriction policy, restricted travels, and relaxed
policies relate to taxes and consumer credits. However, Indonesia has still struggled to sustain
its positive economic growths.
Statistics show that the COVID-19 cases were firstly identified on March 1st, 2020 after
two female Indonesians returned from the International dance festival (Wijaya, 2020;
https://covid19.go.id). Following the first two identified cases, the Indonesian COVID-19 cases
have increased rapidly, despite the social distancing policy. Up to date, there are about 50,000
cases, 2,000 recoveries, and 3,000 fatalities due to the COVID-19 (https://covid19.go.id).

The dynamics, the possible impacts, and the government responses relate to the COVID19 have attracted Indonesian scholars to investigate several issues. Some studies (Muhyiddin,
2020; Nurhalimah, 2020) discussed the impacts of the pandemic on social, economic, and
education aspects respectively. Other studies (Almuttaqi, 2020; Djalante et al., 2020; Kumala,
2020; Saleh & Mujahiddin, 2020) explained the government and people’s responses on the
COVID-19. Few studies (Anawar & Sukardi, 2020; Setyawan & Lestari, 2020) focused on
possible impacts of policies in eradicating the pandemic spread and correlations between
weather and the COVID-19 (Tosepu et al., 2010).
Despite beneficial findings of those studies, there is no available study in investigating the
impacts of the COVID-19 on employment, and poverty. Some studies noticed the impacts of
the pandemic on unemployment and economic growth (Boissay et al., 2020; Caracciolo et al.,
2020; Fornaro, & Wolf, 2020; Gumede et al., 2020; Loayza, & Pennings, 2020; McKibbin, &
Fernando, 2020). Even, the IMF itself has offered financial support to affected countries in
minimizing the negative impacts (https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/PolicyResponses-to-COVID-19#I). The IMF has also provided a link - explaining possible policies
tackling the negative impacts in affected countries (https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-andcovid19/COVID-Lending-Tracker#APD). The aforementioned studies enhance our awareness
of understanding the negative impacts of the COVID-19 on socioeconomic factors, especially
on employment and poverty. This study aims to fill this gap, focusing the negative impacts of
the COVID-19 on unemployment and poverty in Indonesia.
Data and Methods
Socioeconomic data were collected from the Indonesian statistics bureau (www.bps.go.id). For
instance, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), poverty, and employment were collected in the period
2000-2019. This study uses the 2000 constant price’s GDPs which are also available in the BPS
website. The poverty definition used in this study follows the BPS definition, stating that
disadvantaged people who cannot fulfill their daily calorie intake about 2,100 per daily capita
(https://www.bps.go.id/subject/23/kemiskinan-dan-ketimpangan.html).
To estimate the impacts of the COVID-19 on poverty and unemployment, this study assumes
that the economic downturn starts from reduced consumption. This study takes this way as
Indonesia GDP has been mainly dominated by consumption about 61% of the total GDP (BPS,
2018; Soemartini, 2007; Wiranthi, 2014). So when the Indonesian economy is under pressure,
consumption is expected to experience a significant loss (Suryahadi et al., 2020).
The application of the system dynamics (SD) approach has been applied in some subjects such
as macro economy and health issues (Sterman, 2001). Furthermore, Sterman (1991) affirmed that
one benefit of the SD approach is enabling policymakers to solve critically complex issues through
the system-thinking concept. The concept captures important features such as stock-flow, time
delays, non-linearity, and feedback – which are also underlying features of the real world. Owing
to this, this study applies the SD approach in understanding the impacts of the COVID-19 on
poverty and unemployment in Indonesia.

Discussion and results
The Indonesia economy
Indonesia has experienced significant economic growths since the Asian monetary crisis
of 1998. Since an economic contraction about 13% in 1998, Indonesia has experienced
promising economic growths about 5-7 % per year as seen in figure 1. Consumption has
dominated Indonesian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) about 60% of the total GDP (Bahri,
2008, BPS, 2018). Owing to dominance of household consumption, Indonesia has still led a
positive economic growth during the economic crisis of 2008.

Some studies (Suryahadi et al., 2006; Van Leeuwen, & Földvári, 2016; Yusuf, & Sumner,
2017) confirmed the positive impacts of Indonesian economic growth on poverty reduction. It
was found that every 1 percent economic growth has led to 0.5 percent of poverty reduction in
Indonesia. As seen in figure 1, the number of poor has reduced subject to positive economic
growths.
System Dynamics Model
The system dynamics model was derived from other studies (Bahri, 2008; Forrester, 1985).
In understanding the Indonesian macroeconomic model, the SD model is separated into three
sub-models as seen in figures 2-4. The first sub-model is the potential output (PTY) and output
(Y or GDP) sub-model that determines relationships between PTY and GDP. Please note that
the model documentation is available in appendix A.

The second sub-model is called the capital and labor (CL) sub-model that describes
relationships between population, labor, and capital. In this sub-model, a relationship between
GDP, poverty, and employment is defined based on historical data. The last sub-model is called
the Aggregate Demand (AG) sub-model, explaining relationships between GDP, AG, and
poverty level.

Figure 4. The sub-model of the Aggregate Demand (AG)
The model performance in estimating observed GDP, observed poverty, and observed
employment can be seen in figures 5-7. Figures 5-7 show that the SD model can reproduce
similar observed GDP and observed poverty. For unemployment, the SD model can reproduce
similar unemployment patterns in the last decade (2010-2019). As seen in table 1, MAPEs of
the SD model are less than 20% which mean the SD model can predict the observed system
relatively accurate (Hanke et al., 2001; Hoshmand, 2009).

Estimated unemployment and poverty level
To estimate the poverty level and unemployment during the COVID-19, this study
evaluates three different scenarios. The first scenario is the optimistic scenario where
Indonesian economic growth will be about 2.5% by the end of this year (Wardhana et al., 2020).
The second one is the mid scenario where Indonesia will experience an economic growth of
about 0.5% (Wardhana et al., 2020). The last one is the pessimistic scenario in which Indonesia
will experience a negative GDP growth of about -3.5% (Wardhana et al., 2020).

To simulate each scenario, the SD model is embedded by a variable namely “suppress
consumption factor” as seen in figure 4. This variable represents a consumption drop in 2020.
Consumption is projected to decrease about 11.5%, 19%, and 33.5%. Reduced consumptions
correspond with the economic growth of the first, the second, and the third scenario
respectively.
As seen in figure 9, the number of poverty and unemployment tends to increase for the
first, the second, and the third scenario. As expected, the number of unemployed and poverty
are the highest ones in the third scenario.

Figure 9 displays the estimated unemployment and poverty for each scenario by 2100. It is
estimated that unemployment will be about 6.76% to 7.89% for the first to the third scenarios
by 2100. This corresponds with 8.9 million and 10.3 million unemployed people respectively.
This study also estimated rising poverty about 8.79% to 9.46% depending on the scenarios by
2100. This means that rising poverty will be about 23.75 million to 25.56 million by 2020.

Figure 10. Estimated unemployment and poverty by 2020
The Indonesia government has provided support to rising poverty and rising unemployment
under the pandemic. The proposed funding is about IDR 677.2 trillion that is about IDR 87.55
trillion to support medical facilities, and IDR 385.75 trillion to relief industries – please see
table 4 for details. For the safety net, the government provides about IDR 203.9 trillion. Table
2 shows that the potential poverty level is about 25.56 million people or 5.6 million households
– assuming a family size is about 4.58 people (BPS, 2019). This means that the social safety
net can support affected families about IDR 700,000.monthly for three months in the worstcase scenario.

The Indonesian poverty line is about IDR 440,500/person/month or about 2
million/family/month (BPS, 2019). Assuming that a consumption drop is similar to an income
loss (33.3%), the safety net of IDR 700,000 per family could relatively curb the income loss
during the COVID-19 time.
As this support is only available for about 3 months, this study also suggests that the
government should consider and monitor the impacts of the COVID-19 regularly to anticipate
rising unemployment and rising poverty. The most importantly, the government should work
together with other stakeholders to hamper the COVID-19 spread across the country.
Conclusion
This study applied the SD approach to estimate the impacts of the COVID-19 on
Indonesian unemployment and poverty. The SD model can reproduce similar GPD,
unemployment, and poverty in the period 2000-2019. As such, the model can be used to forecast
projected unemployment and poverty owing to the COVID-19.
This study also suggests that available funding for the safety net is sufficient to support
affected households for about three months. In that case, the government should monitor and
handle the COVID-19 flow properly so that the society and the industries can return to their
normal activities at the expected time. If the impacts of the COVID-19 is longer than
expectation, the government should prepare higher financial aids to support rising
unemployment and poverty level.
