"2" "The covid-19 disease has a large impact on life across the globe,  and this could potentially include impacts on  crime. The present short report describes how crime has changed in Sweden during  ten  weeks after the government started to implement interventions to reduce spread of the disease. The first major interventions in Sweden were implemented in the end of week 11 in the year 2020, and we analyze police reported crimes through week  21 . Descriptive statistics are provided relative to expected levels with 9 5   % confidence intervals for eight crime types. We find that total crime,  assaults , pickpocketing  and burglary have decreased significantly, personal robberies and narcotics crime are  unchanged . Vandalism  possibly increased  somewhat  but is hard to draw any firm conclusions on .  The reductions are fairly small for most crime types, in the  5 - 20   % range, with  pickpocketing  being  the  biggest  exception  noting  a  59   % drop relative to expected levels."

"4" "Intro duction"
"5" "With the corona virus spreading rapidly around the world  during 2020  it has a tremendous impact on many countries, both directly through the disease it causes, covid-19, and indirectly through the measures governments and other actors take to combat its spread. It appears very likely that it will have a large impact on crime, but differently so for different types of crime  (Eisner &  Nivette , 2020) . In this research note we will outline how different types of crime has changed in Sweden over the past  ten  weeks as co vid19  has had a growing impact on the country.  While Sweden has taken much smaller measures to combat the corona virus than many other countries, the impact on crime  nevertheless  appear to be  significant .  We consider changes  in  total reported crime,  outdoors assault ,  indoors   assault, personal robberies, residential burglary,  commercial burglary , narcotics crime , pickpocketing  and vandalism .  We  show that  most crime types have experienced significant, but fairly small decreases after the government implemented interventions to combat the spread of covid-19."
"6" "Lit erature  review"
"7" "There has already surfaced  many  media-reports, and  some  quick academic analyses on the effect of the corona virus on crime.  As noted by Eisner and  Nivette  (2020) the biggest impact of the virus on crime is likely to come from measures to combat the virus that promotes social distancing.  They hypothesize that street violence will decline as people stay at home, while domestic violence will increase. In  addition,  they hypothesize several other potential mechanisms, for instance that child maltreatment may increase as anxiety rises due to the virus and lockdown and that alcohol sales bans in parts of the world can lead to major declines in violence."
"8" "There  are a few  published studies, and  several  pre-prints dealing with this issue empirically.  Matt  Ashby  (2020 a ) has published a paper considering changes to reported crime   showing the impact on crime in 16  US cities . Ashby finds no impact on crime before march, and notably that there are large differences between cities.  Most of the changes to crime in his models were non-significant using a 99% confidence interval, but a few significant results were found. One city saw significant increases in indoors assault, three cities saw decreases of residential burglary, one city for non-residential burglary and five cities for theft from motor vehicles.  While theft  from  motor vehicles thus tended to decrease, t heft  of  motor vehicle saw very diverging results, with two cities seeing significant decreases, and three increases (Ashby ,  2020 a ).   In a follow up study looking at calls for service Ashby (2020b) similarly finds that there was a delay after corona hit ten US cities before calls to service started to decline. For crime related calls for service he concluded that while some cities saw decreases,  the over all pattern was that more than half the cities studied  had levels of calls for service that were of an expected level  for each crime type studied ."
"9" "Campedelli   and colleagues  (2020) analyzed crime in Los Angeles until March 28 th , and found no change to homicide, assault with deadly weapon, intimate partner violence, vehicle theft or burglary. They did however note a small reduction of assaults, and somewhat larger reductions in shoplifting, theft and robberies as well as  for  total crime ( Campedelli  et al .,  2020).  Mohler and colleagues (2020) also studied Los Angeles, in addition to Indianapolis. They note that the strongest impact  appears  to have been that traffic stops decreased, while calls for service for domestic violence increased. The increase in calls for domestic violence however did not manifest itself in elevated levels of aggravated assaults. The findings on intimate partner violence were somewhat similar in a study by Piquero and colleagues (2020) on domestic violence in Dallas. They noted a  short-term  spike after lockdown, but after a couple of weeks levels of domestic violence resumed to normal."
"10" "In Australia meanwhile, Payne & Morgan (2020)  found  that for March 2020 assaults, serious assaults, sexual violence and breaches of domestic violence orders were not significantly different from the forecast. They note however that for serious assaults and sexual violence the outcome was near the lower end of the confidence interval, and caution against too early conclusions as the social distancing interventions were introduced in the second half of the month (Payne & Morgan ,  2020).   Taken together these findings show that crime has changed, but differently for different crime categories and in different geographical contexts."
"11" "While  more academic research on the effect of the corona virus will be forthcoming,  there is a  substantial  body of research on the impact of other types of crisis on crime, notably in the form of hurricanes in the US.  One study on the relationship of disasters with crime in Florida found that natural disasters were associated with reductions in crime  overall , but increases in  relationship violence (Zahran et al .,  2009).  This is in line with the routine activities perspective which suggests that the congruence of potential offenders, suitable targets/victims and absence of capable guardians can explain many crime trends (Cohen & Felson, 1979). Exceptional events such  as  a disaster can have a big impact on the lifestyles and routines of people and thus affect such congruences (Andresen & Tong, 2012).  If a disaster results in more people staying at home, there will be more guardianship of homes which should reduce crimes such as burglary. There will also be less people out and about, so fewer potential targets for crimes such as pickpocketing or outdoor violence. There will however be more domestic violence offenders spending time with their partners as potential victims. The type of crisis and the measures taken to combat it will however also have a big impact, which is underscored by other studies on the topic. A study of the hurricane Katrina for instance found that residential burglary increased, which is linked to the fact that people were told to evacuate their homes (Leitner & Guo, 2013). This, again, is consistent with changes to routine activities. With fewer people in their homes, there are more homes with lacking guardianship which should result in more burglaries. A similar finding was noted in relation to the hurricane Hugo, which was associated with large changes in  people’s  daily lives and with increases in reported burglary and people carrying weapons  (LeBeau ,  2002) .  All of this is in line with the hypothesis by Eisner &  Nivette  (2020) that lockdowns and other efforts to combat the virus will have a big effect on crime through how it changes routine activities, and through how it affects anxiety and other moods."
"12" "It should however be noted that a meta-study on violence against children in the context of disasters found no clear evidence that there was more, nor more severe, violence against children during crisis ( Cerna-Turoff  et al .,  2019).  This underscores the uncertainty on many of the issues at hand, and the need for more empirical evidence on how crime changes  during  a major crisis such as the covid-19 outbreak currently ravaging the world."
"13" "The Swedish context"
"14" "While Sweden has taken many measures to combat the corona outbreak, other countries have done even more. This means that the association of corona measures with crimes in Sweden is likely to be weaker than in other countries.  Below we will outline how Sweden has responded to the corona outbreak. As is shown  in Table 1 , the first major intervention impacting on publi c life in Sweden took place on M arch 12 th , which was in the end of week 11. We therefore  expect  that  an impact from the  corona  virus  on crime should start to materialize from week 12.  The police estimate that some crimes are heavily affected by efforts in other countries as well, mainly through impacting the travels of international theft groups. Most limits on border crossings and similar were however around the same time, with week 11 marking the start of interventions across Europe.  The main interventions are presented in table 1 below."
"15" "The worst affected region in Sweden, Stockholm region, has released data on the use of public transport. It shows  a  small reduction in week 9-10, and a large drop beginning in week 11 which then stabilizes at a level of about 35-40   % of normal public transport usage (SLL, 2020). This suggests that some social distancing took place in early  M arch, but that the biggest impact will be seen in the second half of the month."

"45" "Methods"
"46" "In this paper we estimate whether crime in week 12  to week  21  differ from what we’d expect in relation to both prior crime levels in 2020 and  weekly trends in prior years.   While we include week 21 in our graphs,  but  our numerical calculations use week 12-20 since there are some issues with recorded crime dates changing over time which potentially has a big impact close in time."
"47" "The analysis for this paper uses the standard Swedish police procedure to track and project crime trends.  It is based on a basic method devised by the  National C ouncil for  C rime  P revention  to track crime trends at a local level (BRÅ, 2001). Monthly crime projections are simply inferred from prior years of crime, using the median to reduce the impact of outliers. The method is based on the idea that crimes roughly follow a  poisson  distribution, and so  9 5   %  confidence intervals  (CI)  are calculated by the formula +/- 1. 96 *SQRT(n). The method is meant to be used on monthly rates, but here we opt to track weekly changes instead. For large numbers of  crimes,  the confidence intervals become very small, and not very meaningful , but for specific crime types it gives a reasonable estimate as to what can be considered natural fluctuations in crime and what constitutes a meaningful change."
"48" "Research design"
"49" "As the method employed takes no account of whether there are yearly  trends,  we adjust our analysis somewhat. To test if there appears to be a yearly  trend,  we check whether 2019 diverge from the median of the three prior years using the same method outlined above. If 2019 differs, we use the 2019 data as our main comparison rather than the median.  In the next step we compare the change in crime  nine weeks  before (week  3 -11) and after (week 12- 20 ) covid19-interventions for 2020 in relation to the 2019  level  or the median for 2016-2019. If the change is similar it does not appear to be a covid19 association with crime. If, however, there is a difference, we then compare the difference to the confidence interval to see if appears to be significant , and if  so,  how large it is."
"50" "Data"
"51" "T his short report focus es  on describing the crime trends associated  with the corona outbreak for  total crime, and  eight  crime categories:"
"52" "Outdoors assault"
"53" "Personal robberies"
"54" "Indoors  assault"
"55" "Residential burglary"
"56" "Non-residential burglary"
"57" "Pickpocketing"
"58" "Narcotics crime"
"59" "Vandalism"
"60" "All data is taken from the official Swedish police data base over reported crimes, with the data  pulled out  on Wednesday the 27 th  of Ma y , including data recorded up to Sunday 24 th  of May."
"61" "Total crime is the total weekly inflow of reported crimes. Violence is measured with t hree  indicators, assault in public environments , indoors assault  and personal robberies . Residential burglary is measured using completed burglaries in both small houses and apartments. Non-residential burglary  consists  of burglary  of all facilities that are not homes, basements, attics or  a  holiday home . Narcotics  crime consists  of all narcotics crime, but the bulk of it is made up of possession or use.  Vandalism comprise several crime codes of vandalism, graffiti and similar.   Pickpocketing is measured with two crime codes specifically designed for such theft."
"62" "For this short report we use crime data until week  21 but  focus on week 1 2 - 20  in our analysis as we expect the crime data for week  21  to be adjusted upwards due to a lag in data registration which is discussed below."
"63" "Lag in data registration impact We use the date of registration, rather than the date when the crime is committed, to reduce problems of crimes being recorded retrospectively as we want to track crime in almost real time. There is however a risk that crimes get re-coded into different crime categories  or that crimes are registered later than the date they  it is supposed to have been  recor d ed.  To estimate the effect of  lags in data registration  we coded all crimes during week 13, and then redid the analysis for week 10, 11 and 12 during week 14 to see how much it changed. The week 12 total crime count was then adjusted upwards by 1.1   %, the week 11 count by 0.3   % and the week 10 count by 0.04   %. This means that we can generally expect our crime counts to be a slight underrepresentation for the latest two weeks included in the analysis, and we will consider this in our discussion of how the changes in crime can be interpreted , and  do not emphasize crimes of the last week with available data, week 21."
"64" "Results"
"65" "Total crime is down significantly , both compared to prior levels during the year  and compared to the projection based on previous years.  In the beginning of the year crime was higher than expected, but it has since been trending down continuously. Week 12 to  20  in 2020 registered  6 . 5   % less crimes (n= 21   51 8 ) than week 6 to 11 (2019  -5.3   %, median  -2.9   %).  From week 12 there is a notable drop in the number of reported crimes. In the following weeks this appears to have stabilized at a lower level, but not dropping further  relative to expected levels,  in spite of further interventions to combat corona being introduced.  Relative to the projected rate the drop is in total  9 . 4   %, or  30 980   fewer  crimes, in week 12 to  20 ."
"66" "The police divide police reported crimes into 14 main categories. 12 of these consist different types of crime, one  consists  of incidents that are deemed not to be a crime, and one consist s  of incidents without a category, but that is very minor with just 0.006   % of the total. For the other 13 categories there is a reduction in reports  between  week 11 and week 13 in 11 categories. In absolute numbers the biggest drops are for the “not a crime” category (-987) and the “theft, not in a shop” category (-953). Relatively speaking the biggest drop was for “economic crimes” (-50   %), but this category is very rare, with just 3 crimes reported in week 13. For more common categories the biggest drops are for “not a crime” (-24   %), “theft from a shop” (-23   %), “local traffic codes” (-15   %), and “theft, not in a shop” (-14   %). Two categories saw increases, “vandalism” (+556, 14.7   %) and “narcotics” (+151, 6.5   %)."
"67" "Below we will now look more closely on the specific crime categories of interest in the present report."
"68" "Violence"
"69" "Outdoors assault  dropped in week 12,  and has since  increased, but less so than expected given prior years and the seasonal effect on assaults when spring comes. Week 12 to  20  in 2020 was  9 .7   % higher than week  3  to 11 (2019: + 3 6.9   %, median + 31.0   %). Compared to the median the 2020 rate was significantly lower in  seven  of the  nine  weeks post-corona. This corresponds to a relative reduction of about  20.8   %, or  105  fewer assaults per week  (Figure 1a)."
"70" "For personal robberies week 12 to  20  was  - 1 4   % compared to week  3  to 11 (2019: + 7.9   %, median + 4.3   %).  Most of this change was however due to an unusual spike in personal  robberies in week 3 to 5, and after that the robberies have tended to be at an expected level.  There does not appear to be any change associated with covid19 interventions (Figure 1b)."
"71" "Indoors violence  dropped during week  9  to 11, and since appear to have stabilized at a level that is slightly lower than expected. Week 12 to  20  was -10 .6   % compared to week  3  to 11 (2019: + 1.7 %, median  -3.3   %). The relative chan g e  post-corona  compared to the median level is - 7.3   %, corresponding to  7 4  fewer indoors assaults  per week  (Figure 1c).  As mentioned above crime fell before covid19 had a major impact on  Sweden,  however."
"72" "Theft"
"73" "For residential burglary, the rate was significantly lower in 2019 which thus is used in Figure 1d. Week 12 to  20  in 2020 had  -4 5.6   % compared to week  3  to 11 (2019: - 20.3   %, median - 28.8   %). This difference is however partly driven by higher than usual rates in the beginning of the year, and a decrease that began before corona (week 9 saw a big drop).  Burglaries have registered lower than expected levels for five of the nine weeks after corona.  The relative difference post-corona  compared to 2019  is -2 9.1   % , or  76  fewer burglaries per week."
"74" "Commercial burglary dropped  significantly  below the expected level in week 1 2 , but just barely.  It has been below expected levels six of the nine weeks measured.  Week 12 to  20  in 2020 was - 7.6   % compared to week  3  to 11 (2019:  +2.4   %, median +4 .8   %).   This corresponds  to a 12. 4   % decrease post-corona, or  73  fewer commercial burglaries per week (Figure 1e)."
"75" "Pickpocketing had a significantly lower rate in 2019, and the 2019 comparison is therefore used in Figure 1f. The 2020 rate was very similar to 2019 up until week 10, and since has dropped fast. Week 12 to  20  had -59 .0   % compared to week  3  to 11 (2019:  +0.3   %, median + 4.4   % ). This corresponds to a - 59.4   % change post-corona, or  346  fewer crimes per week."

"77" "Other crimes"
"78" "Narcotics crime is mostly a measurement of police activity. It has been at a high level  in 2020 ,  and was significantly higher in 2019 as well, which is thus used in Figure 1g.  Week 12 to  20  was  + 1 .4   % in 2020 compared to week  3  to 11 (2019:  + 2.5   %, median  + 3 .7   %).  There does not appear to be any  general  change post-corona , although the last few weeks included  d o have elevated levels ."
"79" "Vandalism is the final type of crime we track. Vandalism was  significantly higher in 2019, which is therefore used in Figure 1h. Week 12 to  20  in 2020 was + 34   % compared to week  3  to 11 (2019: + 45.3   %, median + 13.9   %). Using the 2019 data there is therefore a decrease post-corona of 4 .9   %."
"80" "Discussion"
"81" "In the present  paper  we have presented  weekly  cri me counts for  eight  crime categories to try to discern whether the corona outbreak and interventions to combat  it  are  associated with any  short-term  changes to crime. Our findings suggest that total crime is down  significantly, as are most of the crime categories studied. Both outdoors assault and indoors assault are down,  as are  residential and commercial burglary.  Pickpocketing sees the biggest decreases.  There is no discernible  association with rates of  persona l robberies or narcotics crime . Vandalism is registered for a slight increase compared to 2019, but a decrease compared with the median value for prior years . In addition, rates of vandalism are largely (~50   %) driven by Stockholm county, and spikes can be caused by the public transport company mass reporting graffiti and similar when they find the time to do so, which means it is quite volatile.   W e  therefore  consider  changes to vandalism  to be non-conclusive."
"82" "All three theft-related crimes saw significant drops post-c o rona.  The drop in residential burglaries  could be associated with  an effect of more people being at home , thus increasing  guardianship (Cohen & Felson, 1979) , but possibly there could also be an effect from  fewer  international crime groups being around due to border closings  around Europe .  The latter mechanism could affect commercial burglaries as well.  It is possible that other countries undertook interventions earlier than Sweden, which could explain why the drop in burglary began before the Swedish government intervened substantially. An alternative explanation is that parts of the population may have practiced voluntary social distancing which could have an effect.  Social distancing, and possibly border closing, are likely to have affected pickpocketing as well. With less crowded public transport and fewer people  outdoors,  this is a type of crime that should become harder to commit.  Either way, there is a substantial drop coming after the Swedish corona interventions that likely, at least in part, is attributable to the interventions against the virus."
"83" "The fact that both outdoors and indoors assault have decreased is somewhat surprising. Reductions in outdoors assault were to be expected due to fewer people being out and about, and  fewer  people in the night life  (Eisner &  Nivette , 2020) .   Previous research in Sweden have also shown that alcohol consumption in restaurants has a 5 – 10 times stronger effect on reported outdoors assault than alcohol consumption at home. The latter part of consumption had a stronger effect on domestic violence  ( Lenke , 1990) .   This is a part of our assumption that  indoors assault  wo uld increase,  which  is  not to be seen so far. It is however possible that the  partial lockdown has affected the ability to report crimes such as relationship crime or violence against children. It may for instance be harder to report crimes to the police when you are indoors with the offender the whole time, and in addition some crimes will be reported by schools or similar, which can be reduced when some people are schooling from home.  It should also be stressed that indoors assault started dropping before any major interventions against covid19 were implemented, casting a doubt on whether the lower levels registered  later  are associated with covid19 at all."
"84" "The fact that both assaults and burglary shows fairly small decreases is in line with prior studies on the  C ovid  19 and crime which mostly finds fairly small reductions in crime, and/or reductions in some cities but not in others (Ashby 2020a; Payne & Morgan 2020; Piquero et al .,  2020; Mohler et al .,  2020). This is interesting to note as the fairly big changes to routine activities, as measured by mobile phone or public transport data, appear to translate into modest reductions in crime. In Sweden however there has been an attempt not to lock the society down, and modest crime reductions can therefore be viewed as being in line with expectations. The exception to this is the crime of pickpocketing which has seen a very large reduction. This is an interesting finding that warrants further examination in the  future but  is perhaps not surprising as pickpocketing “thrive on crowds” which Marcus Felson has emphasized."
"85" "A final finding from the crime trend s  is that there appears to be somewhat of an uptick in crime in the most recent weeks of the study, and that the clearest relative reduction was around week 13 to 17.  A similar phenomenon was noted by Piquero and colleagues (2020) who found that domestic violence increased, but then returned to normal levels after a few weeks. It is possible that people in general, and criminals in particular, adjust to a new reality and to a new normal, but this remains to be seen in future studies.  As we noted in the methods section the last few weeks included in the study are likely to have their crime levels adjusted upwards slightly as well, which may exacerbate this trend. The upwards adjustment however tends to be  fairly small  for most crime types."
"86" "In addition to the above-mentioned limitation the present study uses a very basic method to project expected crime trends. Most papers on this topic have used ARIMA models  or similar  (Ashby ,  2020a; Ashby ,  2020b; Payne & Morgan ,  2020; Piquero et al., 2020) while we opted to use the standard Swedish police method combined with a simple test to see if crime appear to differ in 2019 compared to the previous years  to account for yearly trends . We  acknowledge that this means our findings are less robust than they would be with an ARIMA model.  We do however believe that there is some value in descriptive explorations of crime trends and how they change, and that there may be an advantage in showing how such calculations are done in  Sweden and  can be done elsewhere with very little technical or statistical knowledge."
"87" "Conclusion"
"88" "The present study has described c rime trends in Sweden in the  ten  weeks that has passed since the government enacted interventions to combat the corona virus outbreak. We find that total crime is down  significantly ,  alongside burglary and violence. There is no  association with rates of  persona l robberies or narcotics crime, and vandalism  is difficult to draw any firm conclusions  on but   does not appear to have  seen a major change.  Pickpocketing finally has seen a very large decrease.  As criminals and law enforcement alike a d just to this new reality, this may well change,  and while the last few weeks in the data studied possibl y  indicates some return to normal, clearer indications of that  are yet to be seen."
