Background
To date, most efforts to understand the comparative population health impact of COVID-19 have been made
using mortality-based metrics (Hanlon et al. 2020; McCartney et al. 2020). This has intensified discussion over
methodological choices; in particular, how we value the life-years prematurely lost due to COVID-19
(Devleesschauwer et al. 2020). So far, the direct impact of COVID-19 on population health has varied across
countries, with wide variation in incidence and infection fatality rates (European Centre for Disease Prevention
and Control 2020). Understanding and quantifying the combined impact of morbidity and mortality is a key step
to standardising comparisons across countries, and to quantify the within-country impact of COVID-19 relative
to other causes of disease and injury, sub-national areas or demographics (Murray and Lopez 1996). This can be
achieved by estimating summary measures of population health like disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The
estimation of DALYs is useful to provide comprehensive and comparative public health intelligence to inform
decision-making for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly around direct and indirect
consequences (Douglas et al. 2020). At present, the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study has not integrated
COVID-19. Some studies using DALYs have already been published, but only included one COVID-19 related
health state, or disability weights were country-specific (Jo et al. 2020; Mohanaty et al. 2020; Nurchis et al.
2020).

Aim
Our paper provides a step-by-step guide to define COVID-19 as a cause of disease burden, which can be used to
calculate DALYs. Additionally, we suggest pragmatic data inputs, reflecting the availability and quality of data
inputs will vary by country. This paper builds on previous DALY calculation guides (Devleesschauwer et al.
2014a, 2014b). As our paper provides suggestions for different solutions, we recommend that users should be
clear about their methodological choices to aid comparisons and knowledge translation.

Methodology
The impact of COVID-19 on health occurs through two main pathways: directly, as an infectious disease; and
indirectly, as a risk factor, for example, through increases in mental health issues due to national lockdowns or
delays to surgery, follow-ups and diagnoses through restrictions to vital healthcare services (Douglas et al.
2020). A group within COST Action (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) CA18218 – European
Burden of Disease Network – convened to establish a common methodological approach to estimate DALYs
directly due to COVID-19.
This paper presents the developed consensus approach in three steps. The first relates to defining study
parameters. The steps that follow relate to estimating the impact of morbidity, in terms of years lived with
disability (YLD); and mortality, in terms of years lost to premature mortality (YLL). DALYs quantify the full
population health impact and are calculated by summing YLD and YLL. DALYs can be estimated based on
grouped characteristics of interest, such as demographics (e.g. age, sex, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity),
geographical region, or time.
Step 1: Defining study parameters
The first step in estimating DALYs is to define the space and time for which the burden of disease assessment
will take place. This involves clear definitions of the population, which is being studied, for example a country,
or sub-national region of a country. The time period is usually defined as a specific year or grouped years.
However as COVID-19 is a new disease, only shorter time periods will initially be available.
Step 2: Morbidity – estimating YLD
The second step in defining morbidity due to COVID-19 is to establish the direct health states, which are
experienced by individuals infected by COVID-19 in an incidence-based model. For each health state, there are
three parameters, which require data inputs: incidence; duration; and disability. YLD are calculated by summing
the product of the number of cases, duration (in years) and disability weight, across all health states:
𝑌𝐿𝐷 = ∑𝑙ℎ=1 𝑌𝐿𝐷ℎ = ∑𝑙ℎ=1 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠ℎ × 𝑑𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛ℎ × 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡ℎ .
with h=health state and l=number of health states. The COVID-19 outcomes model is outlined in Figure 1, with
detailed information on health states, data input proxies and corresponding disability weights outlined in Table
1. Health state names, descriptions and disability weights are currently based on those from the GBD 2017 study
2

for infectious diseases of the lower respiratory tract, with the exception of those requiring intensive care, which
was defined by the European Disability Weight study (Salomon et al. 2015; Global Burden of Disease
Collaborative Network 2018; Haagsma et al. 2015). As new evidence on type, severity and duration of COVID19 sequelae emerges, the outcome tree should be updated accordingly.

‘DW’ denotes disability weight; 95% uncertainty intervals for DW are displayed in brackets; ‘YLL’ denotes years of life lost due to premature mortality; ‘LE’ denotes life expectancy;
dashed line represents that individuals suffering from COVID-19 may suffer permanent impairments from other health states.

Data inputs for YLD are largely dependent on the timeliness and availability of estimates reported by individual
countries, and are sometimes based on COVID-19 transmission models. Our model should therefore be adapted
to suit individual circumstances, for example, to reflect differences in restrictions and triaging across hospitals,
regions and countries, and how the state of the pandemic increases service pressure, affecting the availability of
healthcare services. This recognises the fact that the distribution of disease occurrence across health states is
likely to vary by location (Wyper et al. 2020).
By definition, acute infection occurrence only contributes to YLD if cases are symptomatic, however patients
that are initially asymptomatic may suffer YLD through post-acute consequences (Figure 1). Although those
that have sought healthcare support, or testing, will vary between countries testing regimes and healthcare
capacity, identification of suspected/positive cases is the most widely available proxy to use for symptomatic
cases. There are potential issues with the misclassification of asymptomatic cases that are tested, due to
difficulties capturing data on non-hospitalised symptomatic cases. However, we cannot yet quantify the extent
of this bias. Corrective factors can be applied as, and when, this information emerges. People who tested
positive and/or notified cases represent only a fraction of the true number of community cases (underascertainment) as an unknown proportion do not seek healthcare, and even among persons with severe or critical
disease (hospitalised or in intensive care) patient counts could be subject to underreporting. As with most other
infectious diseases, for accurate estimation of YLD due to COVID-19, adjustment of observed case counts for
both under-ascertainment and underreporting is fundamental. A number of methods are available to adjust input
data to estimate the true incidence (Gibbons et al. 2014). There is very little research to date on how this
estimation can be achieved for COVID-19. Data on healthcare-seeking behaviour and incidence estimates from
transmission models are two possible routes, if they are available for the country/region in question. If only
recorded case/patient counts are used in the YLD calculation, then between-country comparisons must recognise
the inherent limitations due to differences in surveillance systems, testing policy, and case management. It is
therefore important to capture the uncertainty around estimates, particularly if referring to country comparisons.
Adjustment factors, such as positive tests as a proportion of total swab tests could be used to adjust for
variations in testing rates across countries and over time to standardise comparisons. However, it is important to
establish the context of testing policies when making comparisons as they may differ. For example, there may
3

be locational differences in testing policies, such as focusing testing on high-risk settings, or as part of contacttracing.
Assumptions over the mean duration in a health state can be replaced by the calculation of person-years of
infection when daily data have been reported. When these cannot be calculated, it is preferred to use estimates
of duration of lower respiratory tract infections from the GBD study, or to derive them from consultation with
within-country clinical expert groups (GBD 2017 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators
2018). Additionally, if the granularity of data for community cases permits, the YLD disease model can be
refined to include mild cases using a disability weight of 0.006 (95% uncertainty interval: 0.002-0.012) from the
upper respiratory tract infections model.
There are several options to incorporate uncertainty in YLD estimates. Credible intervals and/or lower and
upper limits of occurrence, duration, and disability weights can be used. These can also include utilising
corrective factors, as evidence emerges, regarding any issues with selection bias of input data. Additional
scenario analyses can also be undertaken to illustrate that other plausible scenarios may have small effects on
overall DALYs, since YLD accumulates at a slower rate than YLL. At present, there have been limited reports
on the post-acute, and long-term consequences of COVID-19 (Perrin et al. 2020), but as more epidemiological
information on the occurrence and duration becomes available, YLD can be refined to include these estimates
using appropriate transition probabilities.
Emerging evidence is showing that in some cases post-acute consequences of COVID-19 (e.g. anosmia) may
significantly affect quality of life and that sometimes (e.g. persistent symptoms) they may also lead to prolonged
healthcare utilisation. It is however too early to assess the full spectrum and burden of long-term sequelae
associated with COVID-19, so new knowledge on type, duration and disability weight of COVID-19 sequelae
will need to be incorporated as more solid evidence becomes available. Finally, we acknowledge that the
COVID-19 crisis has led to wider health effects that go beyond the morbidity linked to the disease as such. For
instance, lockdowns have led to an insurgence of mental health problems, delayed health care-seeking behaviour
and deferred follow-up of chronic conditions may have increased the severity of common chronic noncommunicable diseases and their complications. We however recommend to not include these indirect effects in
the COVID-19 disease model, and to make an explicit distinction between COVID-19 as a disease, and the
COVID-19 crisis as a risk factor for ill-health. As evidence emerges around the direct effects of COVID-19 our
disease model may warrant revisions.

Step 3: Mortality – estimating YLL
When estimating YLL, two inputs are required: the number of deaths; and conditional life expectancy, both of
which must be defined at age-group level. YLL is estimated as:
4

𝑛

𝑛

𝑌𝐿𝐿 = ∑ 𝑌𝐿𝐿𝑎 = ∑ 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑠𝑎 × 𝑅𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑙𝑖𝑓𝑒 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑦𝑎
𝑎=1

𝑎=1

where a=age-group, e.g. 1-year or 5-year group, n=number of age-groups. Age-conditional life expectancy can
be defined from life tables (e.g. national, regional, or aspirational), and depends on the age group. For
internationally comparable results, which may be important during a public health emergency of international
concern, the use of an aspirational life table may be preferable (Devleesschauwer et al. 2020).
Estimates of the number of deaths will largely depend on data availability. Some countries may have timely
mortality data available by mutually exclusive causes of death, in which case the underlying cause of death
should be used. Depending on the national death registration policy, some death certificates may indicate illdefined causes of death. If possible, then redistribution can be considered to refine estimates. Otherwise if
deaths with COVID-19 as a contributing cause can be determined, then a sensitivity analysis using COVID-19
related (both COVID-19 cause-specific and contributing) deaths may help gauge the degree of potential
underestimation of using cause-specific deaths. Additionally, corrections can be considered to address the
potential underestimation of COVID-19 deaths, arising due to death certification issues in the absence of
laboratory confirmed tests (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020). If death certification statistics
are not available, other alternatives exist. In countries where COVID-19 is a notifiable disease, published
mortality data on cases can be used. However, care should be taken to ensure that these data are unlikely to
represent non-COVID-19 deaths, for example by assessing the time-based inclusion criteria. Alternatively,
providing that non-COVID-19 mortality rates are stable, estimates of the number of excess deaths during 2020
could be used as a proxy for COVID-19 deaths. An uncertainty in using this approach is that these deaths will
also include a proportion due to indirect consequences of COVID-19, for example those that occur as a
consequence of closures of vital services during national lockdowns. Another option is to consider using
transition probabilities from published literature, which are useful for countries without timely or reliable death
registration information, taken from existing case-fatality ratios. However, it may not be the case that these are
readily adaptable in different contexts, as the management of patients may vary from one context to another, and
similarly the probability of dying given the same disease severity.
Conclusions
The use of DALYs for estimating the burden of COVID-19 should be further explored in order to quantify the
overall impact of the pandemic going well beyond available COVID-19 mortality figures. The use of burden of
disease estimates can inform policy makers about the actual magnitude of the overall burden of the COVID-19
pandemic and may help trigger action or better plan suitable mitigating measures.
A standard methodology for DALYs attributable to COVID-19 may allow more accurate and comparable
estimates of the burden of this disease. Uncertainties persist around COVID-19 data quality and availability of
information concerning sequelae from COVID-19. Transparent reporting of uncertainties and limitations is
warranted to favour a correct interpretation of the results.
