Abstract
In the early weeks of the 2020 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, Fox News Channel
advanced a skeptical narrative that downplayed the risks posed by the virus. We find
that this narrative had significant consequences: in localities with higher Fox News
viewership—exogenous due to random variation in channel positioning—people were
less likely to adopt behaviors geared toward social distancing (e.g., staying at home) and
consumed less goods in preparation (e.g., cleaning products, hand sanitizers, masks).
Using original survey data, we find that the effect of Fox News came not merely from its
long-standing distrustful stance toward science, but also due to program-specific content
that minimized the COVID-19 threat.

1. Introduction
An extensive empirical literature has examined the effects of media messaging on
beliefs and behavior (for a recent review, see DellaVigna and La Ferrara (2015)). While
these studies have documented many examples of media effects, they typically do so in
contexts where the stakes are low, i.e., where accepting and following the information
promulgated by the media has little impact on consumers’ well-being. Yet, during the
COVID-19 pandemic, the stakes could hardly have been higher: Citizens exposed to
media coverage of the virus have had a strong incentive to obtain accurate information
to inform their actions and to help protect themselves and their families.
Nonetheless, in the two months before COVID-19 reached the United States, the
hosts of leading shows on Fox News Channel (FNC) expressed openly skeptical views
of COVID-19 (Abutaleb et al., 2020; Badger and Quealy, 2020; Peters and Grynbaum,
2020). Were the beliefs and behavior of FNC viewers influenced by the skeptical coverage? Or rather, when push came to shove, did people rely on other sources of information
and take the precautionary steps recommended by most scientists and health experts?
Given the importance of behavioral responses such as self-isolation in reducing COVID19 growth rates, estimating the effect of media coverage on the public’s behavior is of
obvious import.
Yet estimating the impact of media coverage on viewers’ responses to COVID-19
poses a formidable empirical challenge. The audiences of different news outlets vary
across a range of characteristics such as ideology, education, and socio-economic status.
Such non-random selection implies that typical observational studies cannot isolate the
effect of watching one news channel over another on the beliefs and behaviors of their
viewers. To get around this problem, we leverage the quasi-random assignment of channel
positions in cable services across U.S. localities as an instrument to overcome the causal
identification issue (Martin and Yurukoglu, 2017).
Our analysis provides causal evidence of the effect of exposure to Fox News on viewers’
adherence to social distancing measures and preparedness for the pandemic. We use
detailed information on COVID-19-related behavior, including cell-phone based tracking
of time spent away from home and distance of travel. Using recent data on county-level
cable news viewership and exploiting the channel positions as the instrument for Fox
News exposure, we show that the skeptical messaging expressed in leading Fox News
programs had a substantial impact. Our two-stage-least-squares estimates suggest that

2

one standard deviation (SD) increase in Fox News viewership decreased the time spent
at home by around 1.5 SD’s and the dollars spent on purchasing protective goods such
as masks by 0.1 SD’s. These instrumental variable results are robust to a range of
specification choices and placebo tests. In particular, we find no corresponding effects
for viewership of the other two main cable news networks CNN and MSNBC.
Did these behavioral responses have a public-health impact in terms of illness? We
produce analogous estimates using infections and deaths from COVID-19 as outcomes,
and do not see a clear effect. While we estimate positive coefficients, they are noisy and
not close to standard thresholds for statistical significance.
Finally, we investigate the mechanisms underlying the effect of Fox News on COVID19-related behavior with data from an original survey of the U.S population. Although
Fox News has long promoted views generally distrustful of both science and scientific
expertise (Feldman et al., 2012; Huertas and Kriegsman, 2014; Hmielowski et al., 2014),
we show that the influence of the channel was not limited to the cumulative effect of this
longstanding editorial stance. Rather, we find that viewers’ behavior closely mirrored the
specific content they saw on certain shows on the channel. Moreover, our results indicate
that this correspondence between viewership and behavior was strong even within subsets
of Republican and conservative viewers.
This research contributes to the small but rapidly growing literature on the social
and political aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Allcott et al. (2020) document that
conditional on other observables, Republicans engaged in fewer self-isolation actions in
response to COVID-19. Egorov et al. (2020) find stronger social distancing in Russian
cities with higher ethnic fractionalization and xenophobia. On media influence, Bursztyn
et al. (2020) use time zone variation to show that viewership for particular Fox News
shows has been associated with different corona health outcomes. Most relatedly, Simonov et al. (2020) use 2015 viewership data to show a relationship between Fox News
viewership on mobility outcomes.
2. Background: Cable News and COVID-19 Coverage
The U.S. cable news market is dominated by three channels: CNN, Fox News Channel
(FNC), and MSNBC. While the content shown by each network is the same nationwide,
the channel positions in the lineup vary significantly across localities. As first documented by Martin and Yurukoglu (2017), channel positioning affects viewership (a lower
number translates to more viewers), and the arbitrariness in position assignment induces
3

exogenous variation in viewership. See Appendix Section A1 for more details on the cable
networks and channel positions.
The main cable news channels differ in their ideological leanings and editorial stance.
In particular, FNC has widely been regarded as representing a strong conservativeRepublican stance, often embracing (or feeding) the party’s opposition to “big government” and skepticism of the science underlying concerns about climate change (Huertas
et al.). In the case of the COVID-19 outbreak, Fox News initially took a very different
tone from other mainstream media outlets in its coverage of the virus’ threat. Indeed,
Figure 1 presents the prevalence across channels of various phrases that were used in the
public discussion to communicate skepticism of the threat posed by the virus. Clearly,
phrases such as "normal flu", or “political weapon” (a phrase used by President Trump
in reference to COVID-19) were far more prevalent in FNC coverage compared to that
of CNN and MSNBC.
3. Data
Channel positions. Local channel lineups for FNC, MSNBC, and CNN come from
Nielsen, with information about the area served by each cable system at the zip-code
level. We use channel positions from 2016, and similar to Galletta and Ash (2019), we
aggregate the data at the county level, by averaging zip-code-level channel positions with
weighting by population size. To address the presence of outlier channels, we winsorize
the variables at the top and bottom deciles. Finally, we standardize by dividing by the
standard deviation.
Nielsen 2020 ratings. Television viewership by county of FNC, MSNBC and CNN is
also provided by Nielsen. The measure is "ratings," which is proportional to the number
of minutes that each household tuned in to each specific channel during the months of
January and February 2020. We standardize ratings by the standard deviation.
Coronavirus cases and deaths. The confirmed COVID-19-related number of cases
and number of deaths are based on the COVID-19 dashboard published by the Center
for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (Dong et al.,
2020). CSSE aggregates information from the World Health Organization, the Center for
Disease Control, state health departments, and other agencies. Information is reported
daily at the county level.

4

Mobility. SafeGraph provides information about individuals’ mobility based on mobile
phone device locations. The data is reported at the Census Block Group level (CBG), a
small area with between 600 and 1300 people. For each device, the "home" is determined
by the modal nighttime location for the device over the reporting period. We observe
three mobility outcomes at the daily level. First, distance from home is the median
distance traveled from home that day for households in that CBG. Second, Time outside
home is the median time (in minutes) that an individual is outside the home during a
particular day. Third, Full-time work is defined as the number of devices that spent six
hours outside of the home during daylight work hours.
Shopping. Decadata provides transaction-level data on COVID-19-related products.
These products are those deemed necessary in preparation of the COVID-19 threat and
the possibility of a long stay at home. They include cleaning products, face masks, hand
sanitizer, toilet paper, and face tissues. Transactions come from a set of around 1200
stores for 581 zipcodes in 10 states. The data include net and gross price and quantity
sold for each product class, see SI for further details.
Demographics and Politics. The data on local demographics come from the 2010
U.S. Census. The benchmark regression specification includes the following set of controls, corresponding to the county or zipcode level depending on the outcome: population
density, land area, working-age share of population aged 20-69 over other ages, proportion eligible for food stamps, proportion with no high school attended, proportion who
attended college, a binary indicator for above-median black population share, a binary
indicator for above-median white population share, and proportion male gender. Data
on political attitudes includes binary indicators for above-median Republican vote share
from the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections.
Survey Data.. To tease out different mechanisms of media influence, we fielded an
original survey of 1480 U.S. respondents. The national survey was implemented by the
survey company Lucid between April 9-14th, 2020. The survey focuses on three dimensions of COVID-19 threat: behavior, beliefs, and policy preferences. First, we asked
respondents about the time they last carried out activities and behaviors not complying
with social distancing. Second, we measure beliefs related to COVID-19. We ask whether
respondents believe that a drug such as Hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment.
This was a (mistaken) claim repeatedly promoted by President Trump, as well as Fox
5

News shows, in the early weeks of the pandemic. Third, we ask respondents about their
preferred policy response to COVID-19 concerning the trade-off between economic harms
and health harms. Respondents place themselves on a 10-point scale about whether the
government should focus on the economy or on public health. Beyond these outcome
measures, we also asked respondents about which cable news channel and particular
shows they watch. In addition, the survey provides a range of sociodemographic variables such as gender, age, education, race, location, as well as political ideology and
party identity.
4. Empirical Approach
4.1. Instrumental Variable Analysis
We are interested in the relationship between FNC viewership and individuals’ behavioral response to the spread of COVID-19 in U.S. localities. Since viewers select into
watching channels and programs that fit their political preferences, a simple correlation
of FNC viewership and health behavior will likely produce biased estimates of the effect of FNC programming. To overcome this self-selection, we apply the instrumental
variables approach first proposed by Martin and Yurukoglu (2017), exploiting arbitrary
variation in channels’ position in the system lineup to exogenously shift viewership.
We specify the first-stage equation as:
Vis = α + γs + γZis + βXis + ηis

(1)

where Vi is FNC average viewership (ratings) in January–February 2020 and Zis , the
instrument, is the FNC channel position in the system lineup in locality i. Xis includes
covariates that account for pre-determined locality characteristics as well as CNN and
MSNBC viewership. γs are state fixed effects, and ηist is the error term. The second
stage of the two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression is given by
Yist = α + γs + ρV̂is + βXis + ist

(2)

where Yist is the outcome measure of interest (e.g., mobility, purchases of protective gear,
or COVID-19 infections) and V̂is are the fitted values from the first stage. If the channel
position Zis is a valid instrument, the 2SLS estimate for ρ captures the local average
treatment effect of interest.
All outcomes, as well as the regressor and instrument, are standardized by dividing
6

the original values by the respective standard deviations (S.D.). Thus, coefficients can be
interpreted as the predicted change in S.D.’s of the outcome for a one-S.D. increase in the
channel position. Regression estimates are weighted by local population and standard
errors are clustered by state.
For the analysis of shopping for COVID-19-related products, we have data for a
relatively small subset of localities (581 zipcodes), and insufficient power in the first
stage to produce 2SLS estimates. We therefore produce reduced form estimates where
the outcome is regressed directly on the instrument:
Yist = α + γs + δZis + βXis + ηis

(3)

For the reduced form estimation, the instrument is adjusted so that the magnitudes are
comparable with the 2SLS estimation of the other outcomes.
4.2. Instrument Validity
There are two key identifying assumptions for the instrumental variables analysis.
First, the channel position should be related to viewership (relevance). We provide evidence for instrument relevance in Figure 2, which plots the first-stage relationship (Equation 1). As shown in the graph, a lower FNC channel position is associated with higher
FNC viewership. We obtain a sufficiently strong first-stage F-statistic of 12.48 and a coefficient of -0.103 (st. error=0.029). These statistics imply that a one-standard-deviation
increase in FNC position induces a 10 percent decrease in the channel’s viewership.
The second identification assumption is that the channel position should not be correlated with other factors, besides viewership, that would influence the observed behavioral
or health outcomes. To confirm exogeneity of the instrument, we provide a series of empirical checks. First, we assess whether our instrument is systematically correlated with
a jurisdiction’s predetermined characteristics, which could be correlated with COVID-19
responses or outcomes. These estimates are reported in Appendix Table A.2. For the
main specification, only one out of 11 variables (land area of the county) is significantly
correlated with our instrument at a 5% level; three variables are significant at the 10%
level (above median proportion white, proportion entitled to food stamps, and population density). The presence of unbalanced characteristics could be problematic for the
causal identification if such characteristics were also systematically correlated with the
outcome of study. In our case, this does not seem to be a problem, as our main results are
not significantly affected by the inclusion of these unbalanced characteristics as controls.
7

Moreover, we find our results to be robust even when adding these characteristics to
the model as polynomials or when interacting them with the main regressor (Appendix
Figure A.4).
4.3. Survey Analysis
The survey data are analyzed using ordinary least squares regression at the individual respondent level. We regress our outcome measures for COVID-19-related behavior,
beliefs, and policy preferences on explanatory variables for cable news viewership. Our
detailed data allows us to compare the associations of our outcome measures with watching particular networks and particular shows. All analyses include controls for gender,
age, education, race, state fixed effects, and where noted also party identity. Standard
errors are clustered by state. See Appendix Section A7 for full details.
5. Results
5.1. Effects on Preventative and Preparatory Measures
Figure 3 reports the results for our analysis of Fox News viewership on the behavioral
response to COVID-19. Each panel shows a coefficient plot with the point estimates
and corresponding confidence intervals from separate regressions over time, covering our
study period from February 1st through April 30th, 2020. Panels (a) and (b) are daily
2SLS estimates from Equation 2 at the county level. Panel (c) provides weekly reducedform estimates from Equation 3 at the zipcode level (see Methods Section above).
In Panel (a) the outcome is the average time people spend away from home per
day. The figure indicates that starting early March, FNC viewers spent relatively more
time away from home than non-FNC viewers. Similarly, Panel (b) documents that higher
FNC viewership increased the relative daily distance travelled away from as compared to
non-FNC viewers. This again suggests that FNC caused it viewers to practice less social
distancing. Panel (c) examines the effect on purchases of COVID-19-related products.
Holding all else constant, higher FNC exposure is associated with spending relatively
less money on these products.
To put these numbers in perspective, they mean that a 10% increase in FNC viewership (relative to the mean) increased time spent away from home by 30 minutes per day,
increased the distance traveled from home by 5.7km per day, and decreased COVIDrelated expenditures by $43 per grocery store per day. Overall, these patterns are consistent with the notion that on average, FNC viewers were less likely to be alarmed by
the impending threat of the virus and to adapt their behavior accordingly.
8

5.2. Effects on COVID-19 Infections and Deaths
Next, we examine whether FNC viewership has had an impact on the incidence of
contracting COVID-19 and on death rates from the virus. As above, we use channel
position in the cable box as an instrument for FNC viewership using county-level data.
The daily outcome measures the number of new cases per county within the last seven
days.
Figure 4 presents the results. We do not find a significant effect of Fox News exposure
on infections and deaths. While the coefficients are consistently positive, the large confidence intervals allow for a zero effect of Fox News Channel on these outcomes. Similar
results are found when looking at per capita cases and deaths (Appendix Figure A.13)
and when extending the study period to May 2020 (Appendix Figure A.14).
5.3. Robustness Checks for Instrumental Variables Analysis
We conduct a series of tests to assess the robustness of the results on behavioral
responses. First, we re-run all the reduced-form analyses for the mobility outcomes at
the zip-code level. This specification allows us to introduce county fixed effects, which
control for any time-invariant characteristics at the county level. As seen in Appendix
Figure A.3, the effects are actually stronger when using this model.
Next, we assess sensitivity to the presence of specific controls. In Appendix Figure A.5, we estimate an array of reduced-form regressions, each time excluding one of
the socio-demographic controls from the benchmark model. The results remain stable
throughout. Focusing on the unbalanced characteristics (see Appendix Table A.2), we
show that our results are robust to adding polynomials of these variables or interacting
them with the main viewership regressor (Appendix Figure A.4). The results are not
sensitive to including a baseline control (Appendix Figure A.7).
Next, we perform a number of placebo tests. First, we run the 2SLS regressions
but using the mobility data for 2019 rather than the corresponding period in 2020.
Reassuringly, we do not find any effect using this earlier mobility data (Appendix Figure
A.10). Second, we test whether our instrument is correlated with the number of seasonal
flu casualties in previous years; it is not (Appendix Figure A.15). Third, we extend our
analyses to the two other main cable news channels, CNN and MSNBC. We find no effect
of viewership of these channels on any of our outcomes of interest (Appendix Figure A.11
and A.12), although the first stage estimation for those channels is also weak.

9

Finally, we conduct a permutation test. We regress our benchmark specification 49
times, each time dropping the data for one state. The fact that the estimates remain
stable (Appendix Figure A.6) indicates that the reported effects are not driven by any
specific outlier state.
5.4. Survey Analysis of Self-reported Behavior, Attitudes and Beliefs
To go beyond aggregate behavioral measures and understand how Fox News affects
attitudes and beliefs, we now turn to our individual-level survey outcomes. As described
in further detail in the Data section, we measure (i) the timing since respondents modified
their behavior due to COVID-19, (ii) whether respondents believe that Hydroxychloroquine is an effective drug for treating COVID-19, and (iii) whether respondents prefer
the government to prioritize public health risks over harm to the economy.
Figure 5 shows the associations of these outcomes with viewership of the three
main cable news channels. The underlying regressions adjust for respondents’ sociodemographic characteristics. We find that respondents who watch FNC are slower to
adopt behavioral changes in response to COVID-19 (-0.122 on the timing of change index; p<0.05), with smaller and insignificant effects from viewership of CNN and MSNBC.
FNC viewers are also 12.4 percentage points more likely to believe that Hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment against COVID-19 (an increase of 46.8% above the baseline rate; p<0.01). Finally, FNC viewers are a lot more likely to prioritize economic
activity over protections of public health (a difference of 0.22, or 65% above the baseline
rate; p<0.01). For the latter two outcomes, the FNC viewers are significantly different
from respondents that prefer other cable news channels.
Together, the survey and behavioral results support the interpretation that FNC
viewers are more skeptical of the risk posed by COVID-19 than respondents who do
not watch Fox News, and that the FNC effect on self-reported attitudes translated into
observable behavior.
5.5. Analysis of Mechanisms
A first possible mechanism for these effects is partisanship. Republicans may be
more skeptical of COVID-19 (Allcott et al., 2020), and Fox News persuades its viewers
to become Republicans (DellaVigna and Kaplan, 2007; Martin and Yurukoglu, 2017).
This mechanism would suggest that we are estimating a Republican, rather than Fox
News, effect.

10

This mechanism, by itself, cannot explain our results. If partisanship were the main
driver of the results, we would expect that the effects would not hold when we control for
the respondents’ partisan preferences. For both the observational outcomes and survey
responses, that is not the case. When we include controls for viewers’ partisan leanings,
the results all hold (Appendix Table A.9).
There are two other key mechanisms that we explore. On the second mechanism,
the effects could be a result of cumulative watching Fox News coverage. Anecdotal and
statistical research has documented that, in general, Fox News is antithetical to science
and to the scientific establishment (Feldman et al., 2012; Huertas and Kriegsman, 2014;
Hmielowski et al., 2014). This long-run effect on views toward science, in turn, may
have led FNC viewers to shun public health instructions by officials and public health
experts.
The third potential mechanism we explore is the influence of FNC’s specific messaging
on coronavirus. That is, the differences in COVID-related attitudes and behavior may
reflect FNC’s coverage of the pandemic itself. The specific messaging from programs
that promoted a skeptical stance on the threat posed by the virus would then directly
persuade viewers and lead to lower adherence to social distancing among them.
We investigate mechanisms 2 and 3 as follows. Note that if pre-existing differences
in, or cumulative effects on, attitudes were driving the results (mechanism 2), we would
expect that COVID-19 attitudes and behaviors would not vary across viewers of different
shows. That is, different Fox News shows that were similar in their political stance
before the pandemic would have the same effect on viewer’s behavior with respect to
COVID-19, independent of differences in their reporting on the virus. We can test this
implication using our survey data, where we asked FNC respondents which shows they
usually watched. Specifically, we compare viewers that watch Hannity, Tucker Carlson
Tonight, and Fox & Friends. While all three shows have a strong conservative political
slant, they strongly differed in their coverage of the threat posed by COVID-19. Whereas
Hannity had been minimizing the risks, Tucker Carlson had stressed the potential for a
pandemic and its harmful impact (Bursztyn et al., 2020). The editorial line in Fox &
Friends was in between the other two programs.
The results of this comparison are reported in Figure 6. Each panel shows the differences in the self-reported behavioral outcome (adopting of social-distancing measures),
for a different subset of survey respondents (full sample, Republicans, Republicans who
regularly watch FNC, and Conservative Republicans). The panels show that Fox News
11

viewers of the three shows responded very differently to COVID-19. Hannity viewers
were far less likely to adapt social-distancing behaviors than those who did not watch
Hannity (-0.33, p=0.001, about one half a standard deviation). In contrast, with Fox
& Friends or Tucker Carlson Tonight there is no difference. Subsetting the sample to
Republicans, or to Republicans who are conservative and/or regular viewers of Fox, does
not change the sign or magnitude of the Hannity effect. Indeed, in some of these subsets,
viewers of Tucker Carlson Tonight were somewhat more likely to adopt social-distancing
measures than non-viewers (albeit only marginally statistically significant).1
Overall, this evidence provides support for mechanism 3. COVID-19-specific messaging is driving at least part of the attitudinal and behavioral responses of FNC viewers.
The longer-term effects of Republican partisanship (mechanism 1) and general skepticism
toward scientists and elites (mechanism 2) likely added to this effect.
6. Discussion
Our instrumental variable analysis provides evidence of the substantial impact media
coverage has on viewers’ beliefs, preferences, and behavior in the context of COVID19. We find that Fox News viewership led to lower compliance with social distancing
measures and lower investment in preparedness. However, we find no evidence that these
shifts in behavior affected health outcomes such as infections or mortality. Our survey
data suggests that the impact of Fox News is not merely related to the network’s longstanding partisan stance or skepticism toward scientific evidence. Rather, the specific
messaging of shows with regard to the threat posed by COVID-19 is key in explaining
the observed behavioral changes.
Crucially, this impact of FNC’s coverage took place in circumstances in which viewers had a strong vested interest in obtaining and adhering to accurate information.
Our study questions the notion that the “marketplace of ideas”—a competitive media
environment—will weed out misinformation. Rather, widening political polarization
poses the threat that biased media coverage of key developments, even those related to
a major public health crisis, can have lasting consequences for the beliefs and behaviors
1

Appendix Table A.10 reports patterns for the other two survey outcomes (beliefs regarding effectiveness of Hydroxcloroquine, preferences regarding the policy prioritization of the economy versus
public health). The results with respect to those two outcomes are very similar when analyzing the full
sample, yet drop below statistical significance when restricting the analysis only to Republicans and
conservatives.

ONLINE APPENDIX
A1. Cable News Background
The U.S. cable news market is dominated by three channels: CNN, introduced in
1980, Fox News Channel (FNC) and MSNBC (both introduced in 1996). Each channel
provides program schedules and content that are the same nationwide, but their availability has varied across localities. This is due to the geographically fragmented market
for cable providers. Most of the time, national media producers have to reach separate
agreements with local cable companies in order to make their channel available to the
final users. As these procedures might start and end at different times, the result is
that channel accessibility has varied significantly over space and time (DellaVigna and
Kaplan, 2007).
One consequence of this variation is that the lineup positions assigned to each channel
in the cable box were a function of the time in which the channel was added to the local
cable system, as new channels were typically positioned sequentially. It was also common
for local cable providers to place channels within a similar genre in adjacent or very close
positions. Notably, channel positions are generally stable over time to avoid confusing
customers searching for the channel. Therefore, the numerical order of the different
channels varies across the different cable systems.
Martin and Yurukoglu (2017) provide further detail on the process by which channel
positions are assigned.
A2. Variation in Cable News Coverage
Figure 1 was produced using the GDELT Television Comparer API (accessible at
https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/summary/summary). The GDELT API is a
flexible news search interface, where one can specify specific networks and specific days.
It provides statistics on relative frequencies for user-provided search queries. To produce
our graphs, we searched the Television News Archive for the stated query, limiting to
the stated networks, for the dates Feb 1st through April 30, 2020. We used 10-lags as a
smoothing parameter.
A3. Description of data sources
This appendix provides additional information about the data for the observational
analysis. Summary statistics are reported in Table A.1.

Channel positions
Channel positions for FNC, MSNBC and CNN come from the Nielsen FOCUS
database, which reports channel lineups of all U.S. local broadcast systems, with information about the area served by the system at the zip-code level. We use channel
positions from 2016, the latest year for which we have access. Similar to Galletta and Ash
(2019), we aggregate the data at the county level, by averaging zip-code-level channel
positions with weighting by population size. To address the presence of outlier channels,
we winsorize the variables at the top and bottom deciles. Throughout the analysis the
channel position is inverted (taking the negative of the position), for representation purposes and standardized diving by its standard deviation for easier understanding of the
magnitude of the effects.
Nielsen 2020 ratings
Television viewership by county of FNC, MSNBC and CNN, is provided by Nielsen.
The measure is "ratings," which is proportional to the number of minutes that each
household tuned in to each specific channel during the months of January and February
2020. We standardize the viewership throughout the paper by its standard deviation
for all networks. The ratings of the channels are only available at the County level are
therefore not included in the Zipcode level analysis. Some counties in the raw data were
split in parts (e.g. North County-A, East County-A), and were aggregated together by
simple average.
Coronavirus cases and deaths
The confirmed COVID-19-related number of cases and number of deaths are based on
the COVID-19 Dashboard published by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering
(CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (Dong et al., 2020). CSSE aggregates information
from the World Health Organization, the Center for Disease Control, state health departments, and other agencies. Information is reported daily at the county level. When
cases and deaths are missing for a county for a given day, they are coded as zero. Deaths
and cases per capita are created as deaths and cases divided by population times 1000.
Cases and deaths are extremely sparse for the dates before the ones reported in the
graphs, for representation purposes those estimates are not reported as they would make
the graphs unreadable.

Mobility
Safegraph

2

provides information about individuals’ mobility based on mobile phone

device locations. The data is reported at the Census Block Group level (CBG), a small
area with between 600 and 1300 people. For each device, the "home" is determined by
the modal nighttime location for the device over the reporting period.

3

In the analysis

we include mobility variables standardized by their standard deviation, this is done at
the Zipcode level before aggregating at the County level.4
We observe three mobility outcomes at the daily level. First, distance from home is
the median distance traveled from home that day for households in that CBG (excluding
any distances of 0). Second, Time outside home is the median of observed minutes
outside of home across the day (whether or not these were contiguous) for each device in
the sample. Third, Full-time work is defined as the proportion of devices that spend six
hours outside of the home during the period of 8 am - 6 pm in local time. We include
in appendix the results for part-time workers, defined as the proportion of devices that
spend three to six hours outside of the home during work hours, this does not include
any device that spent 6 or more hours at a location other than home. And the number
of devices at home: defined as the number of devices that didn’t leave home during the
period, out of the device_count.
For all outcomes other than the proportion of devices, Safegraph reports that first
the median or the number of minutes for each device is calculated, then the median
across all of the devices”, where device_count is the number of devices in the panel for
the day whose registered home is in the census_block_group. Home is defined as "the
common nighttime location for the device over a 6 week period where nighttime is 6 pm
- 7 am". Census_block_groups with less than 5 devices are not included.
We report two notes by Safegraph concerning some of the metrics involved in the analysis: "To preserve privacy, we apply differential privacy to all of the device count metrics
other than the device_count. This may cause the exact sum of devices to not equal device_count, especially for sparsely populated origin_census_block_group. Differential

Our data on level of mobility is obtained from SafeGraph, a data company
that aggregates anonymized location data from numerous applications.

To enhance privacy, SafeGraph excludes census block group information if fewer than five devices
visited an establishment in a month from a given census block.

In the regressions mobility sample at the zipcode level we include 27288 zipcodes and 3033 counties
at the county level.

privacy is applied to all of the following columns: completely_home_device_count,
part_time_work_behavior_devices, full_time_work_behavior_devices.." and "Why
do the counts seem low for part_time_work_behavior_devices, full_time_work_behavior_devices,
and delivery_behavior_devices seem low? These columns are relatively new and experimental for SafeGraph, and there is reason to expect these columns to under-report as
a fraction of device_count. We generally do not collect data for devices throughout the
day, so only a subset of devices have enough data to be eligible for columns like full time
work and delivery behavior. However, device_count has no requirement for sufficient
data, so there is a selection bias for devices to be included in the *_behavior_devices
columns. We expect that these counts are directionally correct, and valid for looking
at trends over time, but not as reliable for estimating exact percentages as a fraction of
device_count".

The baseline for these measures is created by us as follows: for the last 28 days (4
weeks, 4 dates per day of the week) of January 2020, we take the average of the four days
corresponding to the same day of the week. For example, for Thursday April 30 2020,
we calculate the baseline as the average of the last four Thursdays of January 2020.
CBG’s are linked to counties already by the census. We link the CBGs to zipcodes
using the University of Missouri’s Geocorr tool.6

include net and gross price and quantity sold for the following products: cleaning products, face masks, hand sanitizer, face tissues, and toilet paper. Data are aggregated by
zipcode, weighting by 2010 US Census population. For these products we create the
total expenditure as the quantity purchased times the net price. We include as a baseline control the average expenditure for the Zipcode in January 2020. Counties in the

Demographics and Politics
The data on local demographics come from the 2010 U.S. Census. The benchmark
specification includes the following set of controls, corresponding to the county or zipcode
level depending on the regression: population, population density, land area, working-age
share of population aged 20-69 over other ages, proportion eligible for food stamps,
proportion with no high school attended, proportion who attended college, a dummy
for above-median black population share, a dummy for above-median white population
share, and proportion male gender. Data on political attitudes includes dummies for
above-median Republican vote share from the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections, these
data are only available and used in the County level regressions.

We define a county as in sample if data for any product are available for at least two days.

A4. Details on IV Methods
This section reports the balance checks of our instrumental variable Fox News Channel position. In addition to the first-stage estimation in Figure 2, we further include in
the first-stage specification the day of the week baseline used for the mobility sample.
Coefficients and standard errors are virtually identical, with a lowest F-statistic of 9.48
for one day of the week.

Notes. We report here a correlation check between our instrument - Fox News Channel position - and local characteristics (see description in Appendix A3). Each row is
from a regression similar to the reduced form (Equation 3), with the specified charac27

teristic as the outcome and other controls still on the right-hand side. Panel A provides
balance checks for the main specification with county-level data, State FE’s, and clustering by state. Panel B shows balances at the Zipcode level for the mobility sample,
while Panel C does so for the Covid-related purchases sample. Weighting is done by
county (panel A) or zipcode population (panels B and C). Political Elections controls
and CNN and MSNBC viewership are not available, and so not included, at the Zipcode
level. Coefficients are standardized by the standard deviation.

A5. Additional Behavioral-Response Results
This section reports the additional results for behavioral response outcomes. In the
main text, we interpreted the coefficients as follows. We took the average coefficients
for March 15th through March 31st. We then rescaled the average coefficient based
on the mean and standard deviation of the outcome and of FNC ratings to produce
interpretable quantities.
For the corona-related purchases estimates, we use the two weeks from March 16th29th. Because the estimates are from the reduced form, we produce interpretable coefficients by assuming the same first stage effect as with the other mobility measures. The
coefficient is at the zip code level, so we divided by the number of stores per zip code
(2.06) to get a store-level estimate.

Notes: Reduced Form (RF) regression results (Equation 3) for the effect of FNC on mobility outcomes,
zipcode-level (rather than county-level) specification. The important difference is the inclusion of County
fixed effects, rather than state fixed effects. County-level covariates are dropped (Republican vote share,
ratings controls for CNN and MSNBC). Standard errors still clustered by state..

Notes: Reduced Form (RF) regression results (Equation 3) for the effect of FNC on mobility outcomes
- Panel (a) & (b) and purchases - Panel (c).
Panels (a)-(b) show 10 sets of regressions on our two main mobility outcomes. The specification includes
our standard set of controls for the County level (socio-demographic and CNN and MSNBC viewership),
weighted observations, with State FE’s and State clustered standard errors and January day-of-the-week
baseline controls. The specifications further include, for one of the five controls significant at the 10% in
the instrument check at the County and Zipcode level on the main sample, either an interaction with the
instrument or a polynomial regression: Population density, Area, Food stamps, White pop ab. median
(county level sample) and No high school, Area (zipcode level sample). Of these controls only area is
significant at the 5%. The interaction regressions and the polynomial regressions for all the problematic
controls are overlapped by outcome. Results appear robust.
Panel (c) shows 4 sets of regressions on the purchases outcome. The specification uses the purchases restricted sample of zipcodes, with weighted observations, State FE’s and State clustered standard errors.
The specifications further include, for one of the four controls significant at the 10% in the instrument
check further includes for one of the problematic controls of the instrument check a polynomial regression: Area, Age imbalance, No high school, Male. The polynomial regressions for all the problematic
controls are overlapped. Results are robust to the polynomials even without the inclusion of the baseline
measure.

Notes: We run here our main specification Reduced Form regressions at the county level, dropping
every time one of the census controls: population density, land area of the county, age imbalance in
the population, percentage of people having access to food stamps, above median republican share
of the county in 2012 US Elections above median, above median republican share of the county in
2016 US Elections above median, percentage of population with no high school education, percentage of
population with college education, above median percentage of white people, above median percentage of
black people, percentage of males. We plot therefore 11 different sets of regressions. Confidence intervals
are at the 95%. The set of regressions lower in the graph are the ones when dropping population density,
a key control in the analysis. The 2SLS regressions are also robust to the robustness check.

regressions lose significance with the reduced sample size.

Notes: We include here two further outcomes for mobility, the number of devices of part time workers
(defined as devices being outside home during day for 3 to 6 hours) and the number of devices completely
at home. The specification follows the main mobility regressions with weighted observations, State FE’s
and State clustered standard errors, census controls, political elections controls and CNN and MSNBC
ratings, and including the January day-of-the-week baseline. We find a significant effect on part-time
workers but not on the number of devices at home.

A6. Additional Health Results
This section reports additional results on the public-health outcomes. We note that
the pandemic situation is still evolving. It could be that media messaging will influence
behaviors and health in subsequent stages. Both the imposition and the disengagement of
lockdowns has been politicized, with divisive messaging on both sides. We will continue
to monitor these subsequent events and potential impacts.

Notes: Each panel in this figure shows a series of coefficient plots and 95% confidence intervals for
daily regressions of the effect of Fox News Channel viewership on cases and deaths per capita measures.
Specification is the same is in the main COVID-19 regressions, with weighted observations, State FE’s
and State clustered standard errors, census controls, political elections controls and CNN and MSNBC
ratings. The per capita measure is defined as cumulative cases/deaths over population times 1000. Some
extremely sparse cases and deaths are reported in February and generate very noisy estimates, making
the graph unreadable, we exclude those therefore for presentation purposes.

A7. Additional Material on the Survey
The survey was fielded between April 9th-14th using the online polls marketplace
Lucid. Lucid utilizes an array of opt-in panels. Survey takers are compensated in cash,
gift cards, or reward points. The large and diverse pool of respondents means that the
average respondent takes 2.43 surveys per month (Coppock and McClellan, 2019).
We used quota sampling to ensure that the distributions of demographic characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity, race, education, income, and ZIP code) in our sample match
the U.S. population margins, as measured by the census. Previous work has shown that
the Lucid samples come closer than the MTurk platform to the demographic, political,
and psychological characteristics of nationally representative samples (Coppock and McClellan, 2019). The final sample included 1480 respondents. Descriptive statistics are
reported in Table A.8.
The survey was approved by the University of Tel Aviv Institutional Review Board.Informed
consent was obtained from each participant at the beginning of the survey.
Question Wording
To assess the impact of FNC viewership on social-distancing behavior, respondents
were asked: “Please indicate the last time you did any of the following activities:”, followed by a matrix of the three behavioral outcomes:
• Eaten in a restaurant
• Visited a close friend at their home
• Spent time in the same room with more than five people
The response options were: (1) This week; (2) A week ago; (3) Two weeks ago; (4)
Three weeks ago or more. The behavioral measure we use is computed as the mean
response to the three items, providing an indication of the mean timing by respondents
of taking steps toward social distancing.
Second, to gauge beliefs about the threat of the virus, and specifically the argument
that COVID-19 can be effectively dealt with by existing treatments such as the antimalarial drug Hydroxychloroquine, we asked respondents: “ Which of the following
statements best describes the availability of a vaccine or an effective treatment for the
coronavirus?”. Response options were:
• A vaccine is already available
51

• vaccine is not available but will be in less than a year
• A vaccine will be available in a year or more
• It is not possible to create a vaccine for the coronavirus
• There is no vaccine available but there are effective treatments (e.g., the drug
Hydroxychloroquine).
We code a binary outcome Hydroxychloroquine as 1 if respondents chose the final
option as the answer, consistent with the position advanced by leading programs on Fox
News Channel. Overall, 27.1% of respondents selected this option.
Finally, we code respondents’ views pertaining to the policy debate on whether to
sustain the lock-down measures given their impact of slowing economic activity. The
question preamble read as follows: “People have different views on how the coronavirus
outbreak should be managed. Some believe that the focus should be on avoiding economic depression and therefore that steps to contain the epidemic should be limited,
even at the cost of more people who contract the virus. Others believe that minimizing
the number of people who contract the virus should be the focus, even if that means
taking expansive measures that bring about a severe economic decline. Where do you
stand on this question?”
The respondents were then instructed as follows: “Please place yourself on the scale
below.
• The right-hand side means the government should focus solely on minimizing the
pandemic’s harmful impact on the economy.
• The left-hand side means the government should focus on minimizing the pandemic’s harmful impact on public health.”
For ease of interpretation, we collapse the ratings to three levels: respondents placed
priority on minimizing the negative impact on the economy, on public health, or assigned
an equal priority.
In the top panel of Figure 5 the dependent variable is the average timing of the last
instance the respondent carried out these three actions: participated in a gathering with
more than five people; visited the house of a friend; dined in a restaurant. This is also
the outcome measure in all four panels of Figure 6. The panels differ in the sample
52

we analyze: Panel (a) includes the full sample; Panel (b) includes only self-identified
Republicans; Panel (c) includes Republicans who watch Fox at least two times a week;
Panel (d) includes Republicans who are also self-identified conservatives. All estimates
are obtained from regressions that control for gender, age, education, race, and state
fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by state.
