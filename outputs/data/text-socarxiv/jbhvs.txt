Rural-Urban and Within-Rural Differences in COVID-19 Mortality Trends

ABSTRACT
Since late-2020, COVID-19 mortality rates have been higher in rural than in urban
America, but there has also been substantial within-rural heterogeneity. Using data from
USA Facts, we compare COVID-19 mortality trends between U.S. urban (nonmetro)
and rural (metro) counties from March 2020 to May 2021. We then compare trends
within rural counties across different types of labor markets defined by county economic
dependence (farming, mining, manufacturing, government, recreation, and
nonspecialized) and by metropolitan adjacency. As of May 22, 2021, the cumulative
COVID-19 mortality rate was 199.3 per 100,000 population in rural counties compared
to 175.8 in urban counties. Net of controls, rural counties experienced a 3% higher
average daily increase in COVID-19 mortality rates than urban counties over the study
period. Rural mortality rates have been highest in the South, Southwest, and Great
Plains. Both overall and within rural counties, mortality rates were highest in farmingdependent counties and lowest in recreation-dependent counties. Interaction models
demonstrate that the protective buffer for recreation counties was even stronger for
remote rural counties (those not adjacent to metro areas.

INTRODUCTION
As of mid-June 2021, there have been over 33.5 million COVID-19 infections and over
600,000 deaths in the U.S. The geographic distribution of the U.S.’s COVID-19 outbreak
has unfolded in three phases. In the early phase (March-June 2020) infections and
deaths were predominantly clustered in urban areas. By late-summer and early-fall,
cases and deaths started to increase at a faster pace in rural areas, but urban case and
death rates remained higher. In the third phase, rural death rates surpassed those in
urban areas in December 2020 and have remained higher ever since.
Higher urban COVID-19 infection and mortality rates during the early part of the
pandemic were largely attributable to higher population density and location of
transportation hubs that facilitate quick spread (Karim and Chen 2020; Paul et al. 2020;
Sun 2020; Zhang and Schwartz 2020). However, in the pandemic’s later phases, cases
quickly spread to rural communities, with large outbreaks clustered in counties with
among the smallest populations (Leatherby 2020). The costs of COVID-19 to individuals
and families have been monumental. But COVID-19 has also had detrimental
consequences on local public health systems and economies. Therefore, it is critical to
understand which types of places have been most affected.
This paper examines rural-urban and within-rural differences in COVID-19
mortality trends from March 2020 to May 2021. We pay particular attention to the roles
of metropolitan adjacency and labor market type in describing within-rural variation. We
found significantly higher average mortality rates in rural counties than in urban counties
overall, even after accounting for differences in population composition, health care
infrastructure, and state fixed effects. We also found substantial variation within rural
counties, with the highest mortality rates in farming-dependent counties and the lowest
rates in recreation-dependent counties. Recreation counties that are not adjacent to
metropolitan areas (remote rural counties) have been even more strongly protected.
Our findings have implications for ongoing COVID-19 prevention efforts as well as for
informing preparation efforts for future infectious disease outbreaks.
The Rural Mortality Penalty
Rural America has long faced a mortality disadvantage (Cosby et al. 2008, 2019; Elo et
al. 2019; James 2014; James and Cossman 2017; James et al. 2018; Singh and
Siahpush 2014; Monnat 2020a; Vierboom et al. 2019). The gap has grown over the past
couple of decades and is pervasive across multiple disease and injury categories
(Monnat 2020a). The rural mortality penality is grounded in the literarure on ecological
determinants of population health, which include individual-level risk factors and
behaviors, community contexts (e.g., economic and employment conditions, health care
infrastructure), and macro-level conditions (e.g., state policies, industrial restructuing,
population loss) that increase risk of or protect against adverse health outcomes and
premature mortality. Rural areas have historically faced higher mortality rates from
3

infectious disease outbreaks (Paynter et al. 2011; Shanks 2019) and regularly
experience higher annual rates of influenza mortality (U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention 2021). Many of the same risk factors for worse health outcomes and
higher rates of mortality in rural areas overall also apply to COVID-19.
In April 2020, Monnat (2020b) predicted that COVID-19 may hit rural areas
harder than urban areas. She argued that while lower population density may protect
rural areas from spread early on, both the population composition and contextual
features of rural communities put them at risk of higher rates of mortality from COVID19 once the virus spread to those communities.
Compositionally, rural populations are older and face a higher chronic disease
burden than urban populations, drastically increasing their risk of high rates of COVID19 mortality (Monnat 2020b; Johnson 2020; Peters 2020). Nearly 20% of rural residents
are age 65 or older compared to 15% in urban areas, and 65% of the U.S.’s small
nonmetro counties (identified as rural-urban contiunuum codes 8 and 9) are considered
“older age” counties where more than 20% of the population is age 65 or older (Monnat
2020b). Because older adults are at greater risk of dying from COVID-19, rural
communities with larger shares of older adults are at risk of higher mortality rates.
Various chronic diseases, including heart disease, respiratory diseases, and obesity
also increase risk of mortality from COVID-19 among those who contract it (Li et al.
2021; U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020). Rural America has
comparatively higher rates of each of these chronic health conditions (Monnat 2020b;
Peters 2020). Therefore, even in rural places where transmission may be lower, the
share of cases resulting in death could be higher. Rural populations are also
socioeconomically vulnerable, with higher rates of poverty (Thiede et al. 2018) and
underemployment (Jensen and Slack 2003; Slack et al. 2020), and lower levels of
education (Carr and Kefalas 2009) and health insurance coverage (Gong et al. 2019).
These factors may influence health care access and ability to physically isolate. Rural
residents have also been more resistant to engaging in preventive behaviors, such as
mask wearing (Callaghan et al. 2021; Haischer et al. 2020), avoiding dining out
(Callaghan et al. 2021), and getting vaccinated (Kaiser Family Foundation 2021). The
Kaiser Family Foundation’s Vaccine Monitor shows that 24% of rural residents report
that they will definitely not get the COVID-19 vaccine compared to only 7% of urban
residents (Kaiser Family Foundation 2021).
Rural communities also face several contextual disadvantages that put their
populations at risk, including less robust health care and public health infrastructures,
labor market disadvantages, and weaker state-level COVID-19 spread mitigation
policies. In terms of health care infrastructure, since January 2005, 181 rural hospitals
have closed, with a record 19 closures in 2020 alone (Cecil G. Sheps Center 2021).
Many of the rural hospitals that are available have less capacity to deal with surges in
cases, have limited medical personnel, and less access to ventilators and personal
4

protective equipment for healthcare providers. Especially relevant for COVID-19 is that
only 1% of the U.S.’s intensive care unit beds are located in rural areas (Society of
Critical Care Management 2020). COVID-19 testing rates have also been lower in rural
areas (Monnat 2020b; Souch and Cossman 2021), increasing risk of community spread.
Differences in labor markets and working conditions may also place rural residents at
increased risk. For example, rural workers were more likely to continue working during
the pandemic and were less likely to work remotely (Brooks et al. 2021; Callaghan et al.
2021), and schools were more likely to remain open or operated remotely for much
shorter periods (Gross and Opalka 2020). Government-deemed essential industries like
meatpacking, agriculture, and prisons are disproportionately located in rural areas,
placing workers at increased risk of infections (Hooks and Sawyer 2020; Peters 2020;
Taylor, Boulos, and Almost 2020). State-level COVID-19 mitigation policies may also
have played a role. For example, governors in rural states (those with lower population
density) were slower to enact statewide state-at-home orders (Lin et al.2021) and were
less likely to enact physical distancing mandates (Adolph et al. 2021) than governors in
more urban states.
Within-Rural Variation in COVID-19 Vulnerability
For all of the reasons described above, we would expect rural communities in general to
face a COVID-19 mortality penalty. However, rural areas are not homogenous. Just as
the overall mortality penalty varies across rural areas (James 2014; Monnat 2020a), so
too should we expect that COVID-19 mortality rates would vary across different types of
rural communities. Existing research shows that COVID-19 mortality rates are higher in
rural counties with larger shares of Black and Hispanic residents (Cheng, Sun, and
Monnat 2020).
There is also evidence to suggest that infection trends have varied by adjacency
to metro areas (Cheng et al, 2020; Sun 2020; Zhang and Schwartz 2020) and across
different types of rural labor markets (Cohen 2020; Cromartie et al. 2020; Hooks and
Sawyer 2020; Waltenburg 2020; USDA Economic Research Service 2021). In terms of
adjacency to metro areas, metro adjacent rural counties are at increased risk of COVID19 spillover effects due to employment and recreation commuting patterns from
neighboring urban hubs. Related to labor markets, the USDA Economic Research
Service (ERS) classifies counties into economic dependency types based on wages
and employment from specific industries. Their six mutually exclusive categories include
farming, mining, manufacturing, government, recreation, and nonspecialized. Research
on all-cause and cause-specific mortality trends finds substantially higher rates of most
types of mortality in mining-dependent counties and comparatively lower rates in
farming-dependent counties (Monnat 2020a).
With COVID-19, on the one hand, we might expect lower mortality rates in
farming-dependent counties due to lower population density which would reduce
5

spread. On the other hand, farming-dependent counties face many of the compositional
and contextual risks described above. Many farming-dependent counties in the middle
of the U.S. scored high on a community susceptibility scale developed by Peters (2020)
in the early months of the pandemic. Their populations are older and more health
compromised (including suffering from high rates of chronic stress that has been
exacerbated due to the economic fallouts of COVID-19) (Pappas 2020). Farming is
essential work that cannot be done remotely. The agriculture industry often relies on
undocumented laborers who might not be able to afford to miss work or are afraid to
miss work if they are sick. Farm workers also have high uninsured rates, and health
care availability is limited in these communities (Becot et al. 2020). Finally, states with
large shares of farming-dependent counties have governors that were slow to enact
stay-at-home and physical distancing mandates (and mandates were short-lived) (Li et
al 2021).
Mining-dependent rural counties might also be expected to have increased
COVID-19 mortality risk given their higher rates of poverty and higher rates of chronic
diseases and related-mortality including cancer and heart and respiratory diseases
(Esch and Hendryx 2011; Hendryx, Fedorko, and Halverson 2010; Liu et al. 2021;
Monnat 2020a). Environmental byproducts of mining, such as dust and other hazardous
waste, harm respiratory health - a critical disadvantage for fighting off an airborne
respiratory disease like coronavirus.
Certain types of manufacturing-dependent counties may also be at risk (Peters
2020). Counties with meat processing plants, in particular, have experienced large
COVID-19 outbreak clusters (Cromartie 2020; USDA ERS 2021; Waltenburg 2020). As
of July 2020, 23 states had reported outbreaks at meat and poultry processing plants
(Waltenburg 2020), including in rural communities in Arkansas, Georgia, Nebraska,
North Carolina, and South Dakota (Paschal 2020; Smith-Nonini 2020; Steinberg et al.
2020). An outbreak in two facilities in Nebraska was tied to 3,438 cases among workers
alone, who then spread the disease to family and community members. Hispanic
workers have been disproportionately affected as a result of their large concentration as
workers in these types of facilities (Champlin and Hake 2006; Peters 2020). Working
conditions (crowded, moist, cold) in meat processing plants and other manufacturing
facilities are ideal for coronavirus spread (Reuben 2020). Moreover, many meat
processing plants were found to be negligent in enacting safety measures (e.g.,
mandatory face masks and social distancing) and do not provide employees with paid
sick leave or health insurance (Paschal 2020; Smith-Nonini and Paschal 2020).
Because meat processing plants were classified as essential infrastructure, very few
closed or reduced worker capacity during the pandemic (Paschal 2020; Smith-Nonini
and Paschal 2020).
Much attention has been paid to outbreaks in prisons and the communities in
which they are located (Hershow et al. 2020; Hooks and Sawyer 2020; Lewis et al.
6

2021; Ollove 2020; Schumaker 2020). Many rural communities have embraced prisons
as an economic development strategy, and as a result, the nation’s prisons are
disproportionately located in rural areas (Lichter and Ziliak 2017). The USDA ERS
includes prisons in the government-dependent employment category. Because of the
crowded and unsanitary living conditions, the high prevalence of chronic health
conditions among incarcerated people, and lack of personal protective supplies, prisons
and jails were susceptible to coronavirus outbreaks (Ollove 2020; Schumaker 2020).
For example, as of October 27 2020, almost half of the incarcerated population in South
Dakota had contracted COVID-19 (Schumaker 2020). Cohen (2020) showed similar
COVID-19 outbreaks in the early months of the pandemic that were linked to state
prisons in rural counties in Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Virginia.
COVID-19 in prisons also has spillover effects in the local community, as prison workers
carry the disease home with them after their shifts (Ollove 2020).
Unlike counties dominated by high-risk industries such as agriculture, mining,
manufacturing, and government employment described above, communities that rely on
recreation and services may have been protected against COVID-19. Recreation and
services, such as restaurants, bars, and entertainment venues, were considered nonessential businesses by most state governments. Therefore, when stay-at-home and
business closure mandates were enacted, these businesses closed, reducing
employees’ and customers’ exposure and community spread. Irrespective of
government mandates, residents generally reduced their visits to these places,
particularly during periods when case rates were increasing (Goolsbee and Syverson
2021). As a result, we might expect COVID-19 mortality rates to be lower in rural
communities dependent on recreation.
METHODS
Data Source and Variables
This study included 3,142 U.S. counties. The dependent variable was the daily increase
in COVID-19 deaths. We retrieved county-level counts of daily COVID-19 deaths from
March 2, 2020 to May 22, 2021 from USA Facts (USA Facts 2021). We examined death
counts instead of confirmed COVID-19 cases because the latter is susceptible to
geographic disparities in underreporting due to geographic disparities in testing,
especially in resource-strained rural areas (Peters 2020; Souch and Cossman 2021).
The main independent variables were metropolitan status and county labor
market type (economic dependence). Metro status was determined using the USDA
ERS Rural‐Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC) for 2013 (USDA ERS 2020). We classified
counties with RUCCs 4-9 as nonmetro. We classified labor markets based on USDA
ERS County Typology Codes (USDA ERS 2019), which include six mutually exclusive
and exhaustive categories: farming, mining, manufacturing, government, recreation, and
nonspecialized (reference group). The ERS determines its categorization based on the
7

share of employment and earnings coming from each industry. For example, farming
dependent counties are those with farm earnings accounting for an annual average of
25 percent or more of total county earnings or farm employment accounting for 16
percent or more of total employment in 2010-12. Each type has its own threshold of
earnings and employment. Details about each type are provided in the ERS County
Typology documentation (USDA ERS 2019).
Covariates included county percent aged 65 and above and quartiles for county
percent non-Hispanic (NH) Black, percent Hispanic, and median household income
from the U.S. Census American Community Survey 2015-19 (ACS 2021), and quartiles
for physicians per 100,000 population from the Area Health Resource Files, 2019‐2020
(HRSA 2020). We also controlled for county designation as a health professional
shortage area from the HRSA. All models included state fixed effects to account for
unobserved variation in non-time varying state characteristics, such as pre-COVID-19
policies and political orientation.
We also conducted a secondary analysis, where we restricted our sample to
nonmetro counties (N=1,976). For that analysis, we interacted county labor market type
with adjacency to metropolitan areas. Metro adjacent counties are those with RUCCs of
4, 6, and 8.
Statistical Analysis
Because the daily increase in deaths is a longitudinal count, we used mixed-effects
negative binomial regression. Binomial models were more appropriate than Poisson
models because they can better handle overdispersion and high zero counts on the
outcome (Booth et al. 2003). We offset the count with the log of the county population.
Therefore, coefficients can be interpreted as the difference in the average daily increase
in the COVID-19 mortality rate between the predictor variable and the reference
category. Random intercepts accounted for repeated observations within counties. We
present model results as incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals for
ease of interpretation.
RESULTS
Figure 1 shows the cumulative COVID-19 death rates (deaths per 100,000 population)
separately for metro and nonmetro counties. In the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak
(April-November 2020), the overall metropolitan death rate was higher than the
nonmetropolitan death rate. However, by December 11, 2020, the overall nonmetro
death rate surpassed that of metro areas and has remained higher since. Figure 2
shows mortality rate trends by labor market type (economic dependence). During the
early months of the pandemic, nonspecialized counties had the highest mortality rates
whereas farming-dependent counties had the lowest rates. Mortality rates in farmingdependent counties began to surge in late fall 2020 and surpassed the rates of the
8

other labor market types by December 2020. As of May 2021, the cumulative mortality
rate was 55% higher in farming-dependent counties than in government-dependent
counties (the labor markets with the lowest rates).

We ran mixed-effects negative binomial regression models predicting the
average daily increase in COVID-19 deaths by metropolitan status. Controlling only for
state fixed effects, we found that nonmetro counties had a 23% higher average daily
increase in COVID-19 deaths than metro counties over the study period (IRR=1.23,
95% CI=1.21–1.24, p-value<0.001) (results not shown in table).
We present the fully-adjusted model in Table 1. Net of controls, nonmetro
counties had a 3% higher average daily increase in COVID-19 deaths than metro
counties. Stepwise models (not presented) showed that the inclusion of median
household income explained most of the decline in the nonmetro coefficient; nonmetro
counties have lower median household income, and lower household income is
associated with higher COVID-19 mortality rates.
In terms of labor market type, farming-dependent counties had the highest
average daily increase in cases - 9% higher than in nonspecialized counties.
Recreation-dependent counties had the lowest average daily increase in deaths (20%
lower than nonspecialized), followed by government-dependent counties (14% lower
than nonspecialized). The rate was not significantly different in mining and
manufacturing counties compared to nonspecialized counties.
COVID-19 mortality rates were significantly higher in counties with larger shares
of older adults (age 65+), NH Blacks and Hispanics, and lower median household
income. Counties characterized as a health professional shortage area also
experienced significantly higher COVID-19 mortality rates, whereas counties in the top
quartile of physicians per capita had the lowest rates.

Within-Rural Variation in COVID-19 Mortality Rates
The second part of our analyses were restricted to rural counties (N=1,976) to enable us
to examine within-rural variation in COVID-19 mortality rates. As shown in Figure 3, the
highest rural COVID-19 mortality rates through May 22, 2021 were clustered throughout
the South, Southwest, and Great Plains.

Figure 4 shows variation in COVID-19 mortality trends by labor market type
among rural counties. Rural trends largely mirror the trends observed for the country
overall. In general, rural counties maintained very low death rates throughout the early
months of the pandemic, regardless of labor market type. However, in early-August
2020, death rates began to rise at a faster pace in manufacturing, government, and
nonspecialized counties than in the other types. In late fall 2020, death rates in farmingdependent counties surged and exceeded those in all other rural labor markets. Unlike
for the U.S. overall, rural manufacturing and nonspecialized counties experienced rates
that were on par with farming-dependent counties throughout spring 2021. Rural
recreation-dependent counties consistently had lower COVID-19 death rates than any
other labor market type.

11

Figure 4. Cumulative COVID-19 Mortality Rates (deaths per 100,000 population) by
Economic Dependency Type for Nonmetro Counties (N=1,976)

Figures 5a and 5b show how COVID-19 mortality trends vary by adjacency to
metro areas. For metro-adjacent counties, rates remained similarly low until the
trajectory of recreation-dependent counties dropped around late-July 2020 and
government-dependent counties’ rate dipped (relative to the other labor market types)
around mid-October 2020. Farming, mining, manufacturing, and nonspecialized
counties have had similar (high) COVID-19 mortality rates since early-2021.
Among rural counties not adjacent to metro areas (remote rural counties),
nonspecialized, manufacturing-, and government-dependent counties had the highest
death rates in the early stages of the pandemic, until farming-dependent counties
caught up in late-2020 and then surpassed the other labor market types. Throughout
2021, farming, manufacturing, and non-specialized counties have maintained the
highest rates. Mining- and government-dependent counties have fallen into the middle
of the pack, and recreation counties have had substantially lower rates.

Nonmetro Counties by Economic Dependency and Adjacency to Metro Areas

Note: N=1,027 adjacent counties and 949 non-adjacent counties
Mixed-effects negative binomial models predicting the average daily increase in
COVID-19 deaths in rural counties controlling only for state fixed effects (results not
shown in table), demonstrated that farming-dependent counties had an 8% higher
average daily increase in deaths (IRR=1.08, CI=1.04–1.12, p value=<0.001) compared
13

to nonspecialized counties. All other labor market types had significantly lower mortality
rates compared to nonspecialized counties.
Table 2 presents IRRs from adjusted models. Net of controls, rural farmingdependent counties had an average daily increase in COVID-19 deaths that was 7%
higher (IRR=1.07) than nonspecialized counties. Manufacturing-, government-, and
recreation-dependent counties had significantly lower increases in COVID-19 mortality
rates, with IRRs of 0.97, 0.91, and 0.83, respectively. Differences between mining and
nonspecialized counties were not significant. There was also not a significant difference
in mortality rates by adjacency to metro areas. Overall, mortality rates were significantly
lower in counties in the middle quartiles of percent NH Black and counties with higher
median household income. Rates were higher in counties with larger shares of older
adults, counties in the top quartile of percent Hispanic, and counties in the middle
quartiles of physicians per capita.
<Table 2 here>
Finally, we present results from models that interact metro adjacency with labor
market type in rural counties to determine whether certain types of labor markets were
disproportionately disadvantaged by their proximity to urban areas. For ease of
interpretation, the IRRs for the interaction terms are graphed in Figure 6. Full model
results are presented in Appendix Table A1. The interaction model reveals important
nuances in rural labor market differences in COVID-19 mortality rates. First, interactions
were significant for mining, manufacturing, and recreation counties. The protection
associated with being a mining, manufacturing, or recreation county vs. nonspecialized
is stronger for counties that are not adjacent to metro areas; although both metroadjacent and non-adjacent mining, manufacturing, and recreation counties have lower
mortality rates than nonspecialized counties, the differences are larger in non-adjacent
(remote counties). Second, both metro-adjacent and non-adjacent farming dependent
counties have higher mortality rates than nonspecialized counties, but the disadvantage
is larger among remote rural counties (though the interaction is not statistically
significant).

DISCUSSION
Rural America has long faced a mortality disadvantage, so it is no surprise that rural
communities would also be disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 mortality. Our
study shows that rural COVID-19 mortality rates surpassed those in urban areas in
December 2020 and have remained higher ever since. As of May 2020, the cumulative
COVID-19 mortality rate was 13% higher in rural than in urban counties. However, rural
areas are not homogenous. There is also substantial within-rural variation in COVID-19
mortality trends.
Several findings from this study have important implications for research and
policy. First, both for the U.S. overall and within rural counties specifically, COVID-19
mortality rates were highest in farming-dependent counties. Our study did not aim to
explain these geographic differences. There are several potential explanations related
to the population composition and contextual characteristics of farming-dependent
communities, including the comparatively older age structure, higher rates of chronic
disease and uninsurance, lower health care capacity, less capacity to work remotely,
and less physical distancing and other preventive behaviors. Future research should
attempt to tease out the relative contributions of these factors.
Second, we found that recreation counties had the lowest average COVID-19
mortality rates throughout the study period. Service-related business closures and event
cancellations likely protected residents in these areas against COVID-19 spread.
15

Interaction models demonstrated that the protective buffer for recreation counties was
even stronger for remote rural counties – those that are not adjacent to metro areas.
These counties had the lowest average COVID-19 mortality rates of any type we
examined. However, the picture is not completely rosy. Business closures and high
rates of unemployment may have long-term economic consequences in these
communities which could affect population health for years to come. In a recent study
focused on the rural West (where many recreation-dependent counties are located),
Mueller et al. (2021) found severe impacts of COVID-19 on unemployment, overall life
satisfaction, mental health, and economic outlook. This portends future consequences
to population health in these communities despite being comparatively protected from
COVID-19 itself.
Contrary to our expectations, we found that mining-, manufacturing-, and
government-dependent rural counties had lower COVID-19 mortality rates, on average,
than nonspecialized counties. It is possible that public health messages raising the
alarms about outbreaks in meat processing plants and prisons during the early months
of the pandemic prompted preventive action to prevent future outbreaks.
Nonspecialized (diversified counties) may have higher mortality rates because they
contain various types of industries and occupations which may have been deemed
essential, including health care. Future research should disaggregate nonspecialized
county types to determine similarities between those with high COVID-19 mortality
rates.
Consistent with previous studies, we also found that rural counties with lower
household income and with the largest proportions of Black and Hispanic residents
have experienced higher COVID-19 mortality rates. (Cheng et al. 2020; Mueller et al.
2021). Racial/ethnic minorities account for 20% of the U.S. rural population, are often
geographically isolated, and face significant health, economic, and social challenges
that increase their risk of contracting and succumbing from coronavirus. Racial
disparities in COVID-19 have exacerbated existing racial health and mortality disparities
in rural and urban communities alike.
COVID-19 will have profound long-term implications for rural population health.
The pandemic has exacerbated existing challenges with health care availability in rural
areas. Many rural hospitals, already stretched thin before the pandemic, may not
survive from the financial fallout, leading to increases in the already rapid rate of rural
hospital closures (Goodhill 2021). There are also potential longer-term consequences
for economic security. About 18% of small nonmetropolitan counties are economically
dependent on recreation compared to only 10% of large metropolitan counties. Massive
layoffs of employees working in restaurants and bars, hotels, entertainment, and other
hospitality venues could lead to increases in poverty, economic instability and financial
stress, with disproportionate affects on rural communities that have limited capacity to
pivot to other economic development strategies.

Several interventions are needed to reduce continued spread and to prepare for
future pandemics. In the immediate term, efforts must be made to increase vaccination
rates in rural communities. In some places, this means increasing vaccination capacity
or reducing barriers, such as providing free transportation or mobile vaccine sites. In
others it may entail implementing strategies to combat misinformation to reduce vaccine
hesitancy. Recent polls suggest that rural residents trust their primary care physicians to
provide reliable information about the COVID-19 more than the FDA, CDC, or local
public health departments (Kirzinger et al. 2021). This means physicians are ideal
messengers for communicating the importance of getting vaccinated. In the case of
potential surges from new variants, testing and contact tracing efforts must be stepped
up in communities with industries that we already know are at high risk of spread
(including those with essential businesses and crowded working environments). Rural
communities must also prepare for future pandemics. This requires state and federal
governments to invest resources to strengthen rural health care systems and public
health infrastructure.
Limitations
Findings should be considered in light of some limitations. First, this study is ecological
and causality cannot be established. Second, data availability restricted us to examining
variation at the county level, but counties may not be the most appropriate spatial scale
for understanding geographic heterogeneity in mortality. Just as there is variation
between counties, there is also likely to be variation within counties, with certain
population pockets at greater risk than others. Counties vary dramatically by size. This
is particularly relevant for rural counties. Eastern rural counties are comparatively small,
whereas rural counties in the West are large and often separated by natural barriers,
such as mountains and lakes. This gives rise to the well-known modifiable areal unit
problem, where conclusions may be different depending on the spatial scale at which
the outcome is aggregated. Third, because we restricted our sub-analysis to rural
counties, we did not account for spatial spillover across neighboring counties. Because
COVID-19 is an infectious disease, there is certainly spatial autocorrelation in the
distribution of COVID-19 deaths. Fourth, state-level variation in COVID-19 mitigation
policies may have contributed to metropolitan status differences in mortality rates. There
was widespread variation in the adoption and timing of stay-at-home orders, mask
mandates, and non-essential business closures. Our inclusion of state fixed effects
controls for non-time varying unobserved state level differences, but cannot account for
policy variation during the pandemic. Studies exploring the associations between
specific state mitigation policies and geographic differences in COVID-19 spread are
warranted.

CONCLUSION
This study found large urban-rural and within-rural variation in COVID-19
mortality rates in the U.S. from March 2020 to May 2021. COVID-19 death rates have
been higher in rural counties, overall, with the highest rates observed in farmingdependent counties and the lowest rates in recreation-dependent counties, especially
those that are not adjacent to metro areas. Federal, state, and local governments
should enact economic and health policies that support access to health care resources
and vaccines to reduce COVID-19 mortality disparities. Governments, local public
health professionals, and community leaders will also need to work to increase vaccine
uptake in many of the hardest-hit rural communities.
