"17" "Abstract"
"18" "W hether and when to mandate the wearing of masks or face coverings by the public to prevent the spread of Covid-19 remains controversial.  We summarise a large  research literature across a range of academic disciplines.  T here is growing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is airborne ,  hence may  travel  long distances and be inhaled.  Infection control polic ies  must therefore go beyond contact   and   droplet measures  (such as  hand-washing and cleaning surfaces ) and attend more carefully to masking and ventilation .  Masks work mainly by source control  (protecting others)  but give some protection to wearer s .  Even small reductions in individual transmission with ‘imperfect’ masks and face coverings could lead to large effects on population spread.   R andomized controlled trials of the preventive  effect  of  population  masking in Covid-19 remain sparse and have  not  address ed  source control.  Performance varies widely across different kinds of mask; comfort and fit  need to  be optimized.  Masks may cause discomfort and communication difficulties, which  affect  some groups (e.g.  d/Deaf )  disproportionately .  T he harms of  mask- wearing  were  over-estimated in the early months of the pandemic;  there is no evidence that risk compensation occurs in people who wear  them or that masks account for significant fomite transmission .  Masks do not cause clinically significant physiological decompensation  in healthy people .  Documented medical exemptions to mask-wearing are few.  The psychological impact s  of masks are culturally shaped; they may include threats to autonomy,  social  relatedness and competence.  Whilst harms of masks  are  generally  outweighed by benefits when COVID-19 is spreading in a population ,   m andated masking involves a trade-off with personal freedom ,  so such policies should be pursued  only  if the  threat is severe and  benefits cannot be achieved through less intrusive  means."
"19" "Introduction"
"20" "Whether and when to mandate masks or face coverings in public  in an effort to control the spread of Covid-19  remains controversial , and  policies vary  widely across countries   (1) .   In many Asian countries, masking was mandated or already widespread from the start of the pandemic, but  most western countries  initially discouraged masking . T he US  Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention   (2) ,  Public Health England   (3)  and most governments   (1)   now re commend  masking in some circumstances. In this fast-moving field, what new evidence  is available ?"
"21" "Method  and search strategy"
"22" "In  March  2020, we summarised  available  evidence and concluded that  whilst  the potential benefits of community masking appeared high and potential for significant harm low , there was  almost no direct, definitive evidence either way   (4) .   We  tracked   citations to that review and other early papers  through Google Scholar to locate additional  studies  in any language up to end October 2020 , on the grounds that citation tracking is more effective and efficient than key word database searching when exploring a  diverse  literature in which terminology is used inconsistently  (5) .  We used a narrative (hermeneutic) approach to summari z e and critique key contributions   (6) .     R eviewer  feedback  prompted additional  target ed searches.  We  focus ed  mainly but not exclusively on material published since our previous narrative review  (4) ."
"23" "Transmission dynamics  of SARS-Cov-2  are more complex than previously thought"
"24" "Infection control measures for respiratory  diseases   traditionally distinguish ed  between ‘droplets’ (large, heavy, and believed to account for transmission within 1-2 met e rs) and ‘aerosols’ (particles that are smaller, lighter, and believed to account for more distant transmission)   (7) .  Precautions aimed at contact and droplet control include surface cleansing, hand-washing ,   physical   distancing  and masks  if less than 6 feet apart ; those aimed at controlling airborne diseases include ventilation  and masks if sharing air ."
"25" "Well-documented examples of SARS-CoV-2 infection between people separated by several met e rs   (8, 9) ,  identification of potentially viable virus in air after  many   hours   (10, 11)   and  detailed case analyses of ‘super-spreader events ’   (12)   lend weight to the hypothesis that airborne spread can occur   (13) .  There is growing evidence to support replacing an over-simplified, droplet-or-aerosol model of disease spread with one that takes account of multiple interacting influences on  how  the virus  travels in and through the air  (box 1)   (7, 10, 14-25) .   Milton has proposed a more nuanced categorization of particles, taken from the field of environmental health (Figure 1)  (25) ."

"28" "A irflow and ventilation: systems which recycle old air may also disperse infectious particles and help larger droplets shrink into airborne particles  (15-17)"
"29" "T emperature and humidity: depending on relative humidity, higher ambient temperature can increase or decrease droplet lifetime  (18)"

"32" "I ndividual variation: different individuals , and the same individual at different times, can  create very different expulsion dynamics   (19)  and some may be super - spreaders   (20, 21)"
"33" "Computer simulations have shown that the relationship between the  above  variables  is  non-linear .   I n some environmental circumstances, risk of distant transmission increases exponentially   (10, 23, 24) ."
"34" "The functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is ACE2 protein, which is distributed in the oral and nasal mucosa and throughout the lungs from the trachea to the alveoli – opening up multiple potential entry routes for the virus  (26) . The smaller the particle in which the virus is carried, the deeper it can intrude into the respiratory system.  "
"35" "When a n   infected person  speaks, shouts, coughs or sneezes, the  ( more or less turbulent )  gas cloud emitted can carry large number s  of particles of different sizes. Depending on their size, ballistic drops may fall to the ground within seconds, while smaller particles, aided by humidity and warmth of the exhaled air ,  can be carried several meters and linger in the air for extended periods of time   (25) .   Four key factors influence transmission of airborne respiratory viruses:  ventilat ion,  duration of contact , vocalization  and maskin g  (7) ."

"43" "Ballistic drops (droplets larger than 100-200 µm )"
"44" "Expelled when (e.g.) talking or coughing. Fall through the air like a projectile. Do not evaporate fast enough to remain suspended."
"45" "Can infect a person either directly by hitting conjunctivae, nasal or oral mucosa, or indirectly by settling on objects, which become fomites."
"46" "Contact and droplet precautions e.g. cough/sneeze hygiene; distancing; masks as source control and possible protection of mucosae when within 6ft of others; disinfection (fomites)."
"47" "Inhalable aerosols (droplets 10-100 µm)"
"48" "The smaller the droplets, the longer they can remain suspended in the air. Local airflows can disperse and spread these particles in a closed space like a cloud. Over time and without air exchange, they accumulate, increasing the risk of transmission."
"49" "Normally inhaled only into the nose and pharynx"
"50" "Ventilation; avoiding closed spaces, crowds and situations with talking, singing and shouting for extended periods of time; masks as source control can help reduce the  amount  of aerosols exhaled in such situations"
"51" "Thoracic aerosols (5-15 µm)"
"52" "Inhaled and reach more deeply into the upper respiratory tract, reaching trachea and large bronchi"
"53" "Respiratory aerosols (2.5-5 µm)"
"54" "Inhaled and reach smaller airways and even alveolae in lower respiratory tract"
"55" "SARS-CoV-2 does not spread uniformly. Many  infected  people do not infect anyone e lse while a small proportion  infect many – a phenomenon known as  overdispersion  (κ) of the reproduction number (R)   (27) .  κ for  Covid -19 has been estimated at 0.1 to 0.45   (20, 21) ,  indicating higher dispersion than  – f or example  –  pandemic influenza (where κ is closer to 1, indicating that infected individuals all have similar infectivity)   (28) .   In effect,  overdispersion  of this magnitude means that about 10% of infectious people, so called ‘super-spreading individuals’, may be responsible for about 80% of secondary transmissions   (21) ."
"56" "Masks  and face coverings  work as source control – and may protect the wearer"
"57" "It was  initially assumed that to be effective, a mask should protect the individual wearer from all or most infectious particles   (29) .   Whereas medical masks are made to standard specifications and are intended to protect both the wearer and others, c loth face coverings  vary widely in design and  efficacy   (30) .   But  as one commentary observed, “ The point is not that some particles can penetrate  [cloth face coverings]  but that some particles are stopped, particularly in the outward direction ”   (page 489)  (31) ."
"58" "M athematical modelling studies have  confirm ed th at the main benefit  of  population  masking i s  source control (protecting  others  from particles emitted by the wearer), and shown that if compliance is high, even small reductions in individual transmission with ‘imperfect’ masks and face coverings could lead to large effects on population spread, especially in crowded indoor settings   (32-38) ."
"59" "Percolation theory (which considers what happens in networks when nodes are removed) proposes that masks may cause \"connection gaps\" between infected and susceptible individuals and spreaders, thereby increasing the threshold at which the disease becomes epidemic   (39) .  A simulation study   of transmission events (published only as  a  preprint so far   (40) ) found that if individuals who infect more than 10 people are avoided, R  will  fall below 1 .  This suggests that interventions which can achieve this efficiently need to be prioritised – especially since  20-30%  of people  have a  asymptomatic  illness   (41)   and a similar proportion   are  pre-symptomatic  (42, 43)   when they pass on the virus."
"60" "An intriguing hypothesis , which does not have direct empirical support,  speculates that  masking may reduc e  the viral inoculum to which  the wearer  is exposed (a phenomenon known as  variolation ), leading to higher rates of mild or asymptomatic infection with C ovid -19 and hence, potentially,  generating  immunity with  l ess  risk of   severe illness  (44) .    Further research on this topic is needed."
"61" "Universal masking is associated with  fewer  new cases and  lower  mortality"
"62" "Several studies have demonstrated a strong  negative cor relation between the introduction of universal masking and incidence of new Covid-19 infections.  Across different states  in  the USA ,   for example,  introduction of mandatory masking was associated with  a decline in daily C ovid -19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0 percentage points respectively   at  1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and 21 or more days after state face mask orders were signed  (p < 0.01 for all time periods)  (45) .   An observational study comparing 34 regions of Ontario which introduced mask mandates on different dates found that  in the weeks after implementation,  such  mandates  we re associated with  25% fewer  new C ovid -19 cases  per week  (46) . In a study across 200 countries, in those  with cultural norms or government policies supporting public mask-wearing, per-capita mortality  from Covid-19  increased by 16.2%  per  week, compared with 61.9%  per  week in remaining countries   (47) ."
"63" "All these studies were observational  but in all cases , benefits of masking persisted after correcting for potential confounding variables.   A simulation modelling study estimated that universal (100%) or near-universal (85%) mask use across the USA during the pandemic could prevent  129,574 ( 95% confidence interval  85,284–170,867)  and  95,814 (60,731–133,077)  deaths respectively during a five-month period  (48) ."
"64" "Evidence from randomised controlled trials remains sparse"
"65" "A systematic review   synthesi z ed 29 adjusted and 10 non-adjusted trials of masks in  control of various   respiratory  infection s  and concluded that “[f]ace mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection”   (49) .  However, only three of the included studies  were conducted in  community settings (the rest were of healthcare workers), and all these related to prevention of SARS, not C ovid -19 .   A living systematic review  identified some additional community trials (mostly historical studies of masks to prevent influenza transmission) , and  highlighted the absence  thus far   of experimental trials of masks for source control  of COVID-19 in community settings   (50) ."
"66" "At least one registered randomi z ed controlled trial of masks in protecting the wearer against C ovid -19 has completed recruiting (but is not yet published). The DANMASK-19 trial sought to randomi z e 6000 healthy adults to wearing or not wearing a mask for 4 weeks between April and June 2020 (a time when the incidence of C ovid -19 was low)   (51) .  The trial was powered to detect a 50% reduction in infection rate to the wearer –  in our view   over-optimistic given that the  main  impact of masking appears to be reducing viral transmission to others. The source control question would require a more complex study design than DANMASK-19, since the person who consents to wear the mask is not the person who needs to be tested (perhaps repeatedly) for infection; such a trial would also have to be an order of magnitude larger  and continued for longer , since modelling studies suggest that significant benefit to the population can  accumulate over time   with 20%  or less  reduction in individual transmission   (32-38, 48) ."
"67" "T here are  several  reasons why  randomized controlled  trials are unlikely to resolve current controversies  around population masking   (52) . First, mechanistic evidence from  the fluid dynamics of aerosol spread  and   international epidemiological data  summarised in this review already strongly supports the hypothesis that masks are  likely to be  effective in controlling spread of the virus. Secondly, given this existing evidence, trials in which some people are asked  not  to wear a mask may be considered unethical  since the criterion of equipoise is not met . Third,  if the research question relates to masking as source control, the optimum design (from a scientific perspective) would be to randomize entire communities in a large social experiment, which in the current context would likely be both unacceptable to some and impossible to orchestrate.  Fourth, given the  non-linear  overdispersion   (21, 28)  and percolation  (39, 40)   phenomen a  described above, causality would be much harder to demonstrate in a trial.  Fifth, as the modelling studies have shown   (32-38, 48) ,  the incidence of new cases may be significantly reduced  over time  by  a  reduction s  in  transmission rate  which do not reach statistical significance in the short term ."
"68" "A mask needs to block the virus – and be comfortable"
"69" "Whether the mask is worn to protect the wearer or to protect others, three aspects of performance must be  optimiz ed: filtration efficiency (its ability to block the full range of hazardous particles   over different levels of airflow), fit (to minimise leakage around the edges), and  resistance  ( so  the mask  is not  difficult to breathe through)  (30, 31, 53-59) .  M asks  undoubted ly reduce droplet spread from coughs and sneezes  (23) , but to be effective they need to block smaller airborne particles  too and be sufficiently comfortable  and acceptable  to be  wor n   correctly and kept on  for long periods   (30, 31, 57-63) .

"109" "Laboratory studies  have shown that both  valved  respirators and face shields are substantially less eff ective  at blocking  small airborne particles  than either cloth or medical masks – the former because the valve (unless covered) effectively acts as an exhaust pipe and the latter because the shield may channel a powerful jet that escapes upwards or downwards  (63, 64) ."
"110" "Claims  of  risk compensation   and fomite transmission  have not been substantiated"
"111" "Scientists and policymakers  initially   expressed concern that masks or face coverings could cause risk compensation (the wearer reduces other protective behaviours out of a false sense of security)  or  increase risk of transmission  by  act ing  as fomites  ( especially if there is increased face-touching  followed by  touching an environmental surface )   (65, 66) ."
"112" "A narrative review summarised evidence which  refuted  the risk compensation hypothesis in the examples most commonly cited by mask  skeptics  (cycle helmets, seat belts, and interventions to prevent sexually transmitted diseases)   (67) .  The authors  also  found no evidence to support the claim that risk compensation occurs with  masks or  face coverings, and identified three studies  that   showed that if a person is wearing a mask, protective  behaviors  appear to  increase  in those around them   (68-70) ."
"113" "A fourth study, from Germany, found no evidence of risk compensation when masks were introduced for the public   (71) .  Video evidence from public settings (e.g. stations, parks, shopping malls) in multiple countries before and after the introduction of masking policies found that those wearing masks touched their faces significantly  less  frequently than those not wearing masks   (72) .   A systematic review designed to identify harms from mask wearing found no evidence of risk compensation  and  no evidence of increased face-touching  (66) ."
"114" "Whil e  some people argue that discarded masks could transmit C ovid -19   (73) ,   we identified   no  published  case s   of   the disease being acquired this way."
"115" "Masks may cause discomfort and c ommunication  difficulties"
"116" "Bakhit  et  al’s   2020  systematic  review identif ied  consistent evidence of discomfort,  subjective  difficulty breathing, skin rashes and headache with prolonged use of respirators and  med ical masks by healthcare workers, and more limited evidence of discomfort and difficulty breathing with cloth masks   (66) .  A narrative review by Scheid et al listed headache, skin itching and rashes, and a perception of breathlessness among healthcare workers who wore  medical  masks or respirators for prolonged periods during the Covid-19 pandemic, but noted that symptoms may have been exacerbated by long working hours, stress and anxiety  (62) .  A large Polish study of self-reported symptoms among the general public found that around 20% experienced facial itching with prolonged mask-wearing   (74) .   Children appear to experience similar kinds of discomfort to adults when wearing medical masks  (75) ."
"117" "Bakhit  et  al’s  review also  documented reports  in  healthcare workers   of difficulties in face - to - face (but not telephone) communication with all kinds of mask , though most  evidence  related to respirators   (66) .   O ne trial found that only 3% of healthcare workers had difficulty communicating when wearing a medical mask  (76) .    Communication while masked may be particularly challenging with young children  (77) , older people  (78)  and those with hearing impairments  (79, 80) . These problems are exacerbated by physical distancing and the muffling effect of mask materials on speech  (79) ."
"118" "There is no easy answer to the question of how to balance communication needs with the need to reduce viral transmission. Recommended strategies include speaking slowly and clearly with a minimum of background noise ,  encouraging use of hearing aids ,  and  using  speech-to-text technologies  (79, 81) , though these are not always practicable or effective. Transparent masks and modified face shields (which include a cloth apron seal around the sides and bottom  (79) ) allow lip-reading but  the performance of  such products  is largely untested . One study in healthcare workers found that shields were perceived as uncomfortable, cumbersome and reduced the ability to hear others  (82) ."
"119" "C laims of  physiological decompensation  are not substantiated"
"120" "We found no empirical evidence  t o support the claim that   medical  masks  or cloth  face coverings interfere with gas exchange  to a clinically significant extent  in  healthy  people  at  rest .  In nurses wearing medical masks through a 12-hour shift, no changes were observed in  in  blood  carbon dioxide  or oxygen  level s; minor changes in carbon dioxide levels were detected after 12 hours wearing a respirator   (83) . Another study, on surgeons  wearing surgical masks , showed a fall in blood oxygen levels from 98% to 96% during prolonged surgery   – a difference which was statistically  significant  but not  judged  clinically  relevant   (84) ."
"121" "The hypothesis that masks may cause  potentially harmful  physiological changes  during exercise  (85)  has limited empirical support   (86) , perhaps partly because respirators and medical masks need to comply with standards for maximum airflow resistance .   Whilst clinically minor physiological changes have sometimes been demonstrated when healthy volunteers do intensive exercise w earing  tightly-fitting respirators   (87-90) ,   those wearing medical masks  (90, 91)  and cloth masks  (92)  showed no physiological changes   during  moderate or  intensive exercise ."
"122" "Whilst m any  policies acknowledge that some people should be exempt from mask-wearing  (on the assumption that such individuals could come to harm) , there is no consistency  –  and little firm evidence  –  on who should be exempt (box 2)."
"123" "Box 2: Exemption from mask wearing"
"124" "Exemption from mask-wearing may be justified on three main grounds:"
"125" "medical reasons (including psychological distress),"
"126" "age"
"127" "where the mask would interfere with particular occupations or activities."
"128" "The US  Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that “masks should not be worn by …  anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance ”  (108) , but gives no further detail. National and regional guidance varies but the following are commonly included"
"129" "respiratory illnesses"
"130" "autism"
"131" "past trauma or other conditions where wearing a mask may cause psychological distress"
"132" "facial injuries or conditions (e.g. trigeminal neuralgia)"
"133" "There is little underpinning empirical evidence for medical exemption categories. Only two conditions have any empirical evidence, both relating to respirators for long periods  (62) :"
"134" "people with end-stage renal failure developed clinically significant hypoxia"
"135" "people with various respiratory conditions experienced breathing difficulties"
"136" "This review did not identify any studies describing harms in those with medical conditions when wearing medical or cloth masks, nor any evidence of harm from masks in pregnant women or people with mild asthma  (62) ."
"137" "Age cut-offs for mandatory mask-wearing vary from 2 (Ontario, Canada), 5 (South Africa), 6 (Scotland, United Arab Emirates, Spain, most regions of Germany, schools in France), 10 (Quebec, Canada), 11 (England and Wales,   public places in France), 12 (Switzerland and most states in Australia), 13 (Latvia, Netherlands) and 15 (Finland)  (1) . The US  Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention recommends mask wearing by those over the age of 2; the World Health Organisation uses a cut-off of 12  (65) . Research on the acceptability of masks to children is limited  (75)  but we could find no evidence of harm or non-compliance."
"138" "Occupational exemptions in official guidance vary but typically include"
"139" "Those for whom wearing a mask may pose a health and safety risk"
"140" "Those whose profession requires clear enunciation or visibility of the mouth (e.g. teachers, performers)"
"141" "Professional athletes and others undertaking intensive physical exercise."
"142" "The psychology of mask-wearing varies with cultural context"
"143" "Scheid et al dr a w on self-determination theory  to consider the impact of mask-wearing on  what they call  t hree universal, fundamental needs for optimal wellbeing: autonomy   (the ability to have free will and choice over one’s actions),  psychological relatedness  (feeling socially connected to others) , and competence  (the feeling that  we are effective, capable and have mastery over our circumstances )   (62) . Mandated  mask-wearing, they suggest, threatens autonomy, which may explain the high levels of resistance to such policies in some settings.  Mask-wearing  may also threaten psychological relatedness in settings such as the USA where commitment to  it  is strongly linked to one political party, leading to ingroup-outgroup (us versus them) identity issues  (62) .  S ome political and religious leaders have depicted mask-wearing as female and submissive, hence inappropriate for men  (62, 93) .  Competence, in this context, is related to people’s perception of whether wearing a mask will be effective.   M ixed messages about the efficacy  and harms  of masking in the early months of the pandemic led to confusion and lack of confidence in this intervention  (62) , and may partly explain  occasional reports of anxiety (e.g. concern about becoming infected) and perceived stigma   (66) ."
"144" "High compliance with mask-wearing in  some non-Western  countries is often attributed to greater conformism or collectivism but may have more complex explanations  includ ing   earlier  experience of deadly epidemics,  a  medical  tradition  of using masks as protection against hay fever, and the practicalities of living with high levels of dust and atmospheric pollution   (94-96) . In  many hot countries , both men and women t raditionally  wear loose pieces of cloth over the head and lower face  to protect against heat and dust ; such items were repurposed as protection against  Covid -19   (97, 98) .    One Japanese anthropologist  has  depict ed  mask-wearing by the Japanese as a  way of  restor ing  a sense of control in the face of uncertainties  and establish ing  a boundary between a clean and pure inner self and a potentially polluted outside  (95) .   For all these reasons, mask-wearing in  some non-western  countries may promote rather than threaten  a sense  of autonomy, relatedness and competence."
"145" "In a cultural environment where masks are common, people may have learned to express and understand  alternative  cues to communicate emotions, while in western societies the readability of emotions  may be  hampered by masks  (99) .  In one study, adherence to mask wearing was greater in those who empathized with people who were vulnerable Covid-19, and inducing empathy improved adherence ,  whereas merely informing people of the benefits to others did not  (100) ."
"146" "Benefits must be balanced against harms and  acceptability"
"147" "The observational studies summarised above  (45-47, 61) ,  along with modelling studies  (32-38, 48) ,  suggest that across a range of scenarios, use of masks among the general public is an  effective strategy in mitigating transmission of SARS-CoV-2 .  Even with a limited protective effect, masks can reduce total infections and deaths (especially in relation to pre-symptomatic transmission) and delay the peak time of the epidemic."
"148" "But mandatory masking is unpopular with some and an infringement (albeit a relatively minor one) of individual freedom.  It  should therefore be restricted to situations where it is likely to be both effective and cost-effective (i.e. when faced with a disease that is both prevalent and dangerous).  It  is not justified if the targeted disease is innocuous or can be prevented by other means which are more effective, more acceptable, less risky or  less expensive ."
"149" "C ovid -19 is not innocuous: it has killed many millions around the world   (101) ,  produced a cohort of survivors with chronic symptoms and unknown long-term prognosis   (102) ,  stretched health systems to (and sometimes beyond) their limits   (103) ,  and devastated economies   (104) .  Voluntary masking has been successful in many Asian countries (notably Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan) but less so in western countries where the measure was less culturally acceptable   (105) ."
"150" "Because of potential airborne transmission, C ovid -19 is inherently difficult to contain. As with public masking, the impacts and costs of school closures, gathering bans, closing borders, quarantine regulations, travel restrictions, working from home, closing restaurants and non-essential shops, physical distance rules, coughing etiquette, handwashing, and restricting visits to hospitals and nursing homes are difficult to quantify. Moreover, these measures play out differently and have different personal costs depending on the situation. Schools, for example, need to balance their duty of care to vulnerable pupils and staff with their educational mission  and student welfare , which includes meeting the needs of pupils of different ages and abilities, and those with (for example) autism and hearing impairments. Masking for  only  some groups, in some parts of schools, and with exceptions  granted ,  may be  more  appropriate   than rigid universal mandates."
"151" "C oncerns about environmental pollution from mask waste   (106, 107)  are well-founded, since medical masks are made from petrochemicals and are non-biodegradable. Home-made washable cloth face coverings are more environmentally friendly and may have greater cultural appeal (and hence, better compliance)   (105) ."
"152" "Conclusion"
"153" "This narrative review has summarized  a heterogeneous body of evidence  on  population masking in the  context of the  Covid-19 pandemic. Evidence that the virus  can be  airborne  ( and  therefore be inhaled) and  that masking policies, when effectively delivered, save lives is now strong. There is no evidence of serious harms from masks and face coverings, though discomfort, communication difficulties and environmental  effec ts  are not in significant.  Psychological impacts, which are culturally framed, shape acceptance and compliance."
"154" "As masking has become recommended or mandated, there is  an urgent research agenda   to  develop alternatives that are more efficient, more comfortable,  more acceptable,   less disruptive of normal communication practices and  more environmentally friendly than  currently available products ."
"155" "Until t he threat of the pandemic is behind us , we recommend that the public wear masks or face coverings  in  situations and settings where there is a high risk of transmission –  notably  where  ventilation is poor, when large numbers of people are gathered, when some are vocalising (especially singing or shouting), and when contact is prolonged  (7) ."
