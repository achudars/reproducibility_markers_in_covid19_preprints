Abstract
In March 2020, schools in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia were suspended. Online learning
became a substitute for traditional face-to-face learning. This study addresses the implications of
this shift for the attitudes of university-level English majored Saudi students taking a listening
and speaking course. The study investigated the students’ attitudes towards: a) the importance of
speaking in English; b) teachers use of emails to communicate their feedback on students’
English-speaking tasks; c) online teaching of English speaking; and d) online learning and
teaching of the English language. The data collection tool was a 21-item questionnaire. The
participants were 18 second-year male Saudi students who were studying English at a Saudi
university. The findings showed that the participants: a) had positive attitudes towards the
importance of speaking English; b) appreciated the benefits that online learning offers, but felt it
could not replace face-to-face learning.

Teaching English Speaking Online versus Face-to-Face: Saudi Students’

Alzamil

Introduction
Of the four skills in English (reading, writing, listening and speaking), mastering
speaking is a priority for most L2 learners. Saudi students learning English are no exception, and
are aware of the importance of expressing themselves fluently in English. Since the world was
hit by the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019, the shape of learning and teaching has
changed tremendously. Face-to-face learning was replaced by online learning in many parts of
the world (Fansury, Januarty, & Rahman, 2020). Saudi Arabia suspended all schools and
educational institutes in March 2020, replacing it with implemented online and distant learning
for the duration of the suspension, thus altering the form of communication between teachers and
students.
This study investigates students’ attitudes towards the shift from face-to-face learning to
online learning in a Saudi university English department and whether this facilitates or hinders
their ability to master L2 speaking. Examining this provides us with greater insight into: a) the
online learning approach; b) its consequences for teaching and evaluating speaking skills; and c)
students’ views on speaking in a virtual class versus speaking in an actual class. The study aims
to answer the following research questions:
1. What attitudes do university-level Saudi students who specialise in English have
towards:
a. the importance of speaking in English;
a. teachers’ use of emails in communicating their feedback for students’ Englishspeaking tasks;
b. online learning of English speaking; and
c. online learning of the English language?
Literature Review
Teaching English in Saudi Arabia
According to Alhmadi (2014), the Saudi education system consists of three levels: a)
primary (six years); b) intermediate (three years); and secondary (three years). The school year
consists of two fifteen-week semesters. Students start learning English in the fourth year of the
primary level. Students have four classes (45 minutes each) of English a week. Alhmadi (2014)
has asserted that school students graduate with low levels of English proficiency because they do
not get adequate exposure to the English language at secondary school. As a result, students who
specialise in English at university-level struggle with English, especially at the beginning.
Teaching L2 English Speaking
Speaking is a means of expressing meaning in speech (Alsaedi, 2012; Fulcher, 2003).
Speaking in L1 and L2 is a productive skill that is acquired unconsciously in L1 and consciously
in L2. Conversely, writing and reading are learned consciously in both L1 and L2 (Sharma,
2015), and are learned later in life because they are skills that need to be taught.
In his investigation of factors affecting Saudi undergraduate students’ speaking skills,
Hamad (2013) enrolled 150 female students, who then completed a questionnaire. He found that
the main obstacle to speaking English was the students’ fear of speaking it, even in more private
conditions such as making a phone call. The students attributed this to a lack of opportunities to

speak English and to strategies implemented by their teachers, who focused more on improving
their listening skills than their speaking skills. This is supported by Alharbi (2015) who stated
that practicing English in authentic situations is difficult in EFL contexts such as Saudi Arabia.
Another possibility is that the focus in education institutions is on improving writing skills, as
supported by study outlined below.
Drawing on a sample of 90 students and 10 teachers, Al-Ahdal, Alfallaj, Al-Awaied,, &
Al-Hattami (2014) examined Saudi students’ L2 speaking and writing skills. Data was collected
using a mixture of questionnaires, interviews and tests to compare both skills. It was found that
participants’ writing skills were better than their speaking skills. The authors suggested that
teachers should cooperate with students and their parents to create a suitable environment for
them to practise speaking in English.
Another study was conducted by Ali, Shamsan, Guduru, & Yemmela (2019) with 100
Saudi undergraduates (50 males and 50 females) to investigate their attitudes towards Englishspeaking skills. A questionnaire was administered, and the findings revealed that both male and
female students had the same positive attitudes towards speaking in English, and that it is a
crucial skill.
It can be observed from the studies above that speaking in English is difficult for L2
learners of English and that this is an issue for both males and females. The reasons vary from
not focusing enough on improving students’ speaking skills to other factors related to the
learning environment and practicing speaking. The next section discusses the teaching of L2
speaking in an online learning environment.
Online Learning
Online or electronic learning (E-learning) has become an important aspect of the provision
of education materials around the world. However, the extent to which it is used differs from
place to place (Harandi, 2015). Using email in communication and E-books in teaching have
become common practices in the vast majority of universities around the world (Harandi, 2015).
However, technology has yet to replace the traditional teacher-classroom-student form of
teaching. Saudi universities started to adopt online learning in their teaching plans by
establishing institutes and colleges to work on transforming the form of learning (Al-Asmari &
Khan, 2014), and implementing online learning has been the focus of the Saudi Ministry of
Education since 2005 (Alhabeeb & Rowley, 2017). A number of studies have addressed the
effectiveness of online learning and asked whether students prefer it to face-to-face learning.
Three such studies are discussed below.
Paechter and Maier’s (2010) study aimed to investigate students’ attitudes towards online
learning vs. face-to-face learning. They recruited 2196 Austrian undergraduates, whose opinions
were collected by means of a questionnaire. Their results show that participants thought online
learning was a clear and more organised approach to learning. They also preferred face-to-face
learning when communication was required.
Gorra and Bhati (2016) examined the consequences of online learning for university-level
students in the Philippines. Based on a sample of 221 students, the study used a questionnaire to

seek their opinions about the importance of online learning. They found that the students had
positive attitudes to the use of technology in learning, and that it had positive effects on the
learning experience. However, students had negative attitudes towards the use of social media in
learning, as students may use social media to chat and play music and games, which may have
negative consequences on learning outcomes.
A recent study carried out by Fansury et al. (2020) examined the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic on learning. Interview data were collected from 50 students and 20 teachers in
Indonesia, who were also asked to complete a questionnaire. The results showed that learning
can take place digitally to overcome social distancing and the suspension of schools. Moreover,
they found that students preferred online learning to traditional classroom learning. Nevertheless,
both teachers and students complained about technical problems such as internet disconnection
and the cost of internet data.
The online learning studies discussed above show that both students and teachers view
online learning positively. However, it is not clear whether students prefer it simply because they
are bored with traditional methods and it is a new form of teaching, or whether they like it
because it is actually more effective
Methods
To minimise bias and facilitate generalisation of the data (Larson-Hall, 2016), this study
took a quantitative approach to data collection. There were 18 participants (mean age 20.5 years;
SD=1.1) who were all second-year university-level students studying English at a Saudi
university. There were intended to be 29 participants, but due to difficulty in reaching some
students only 18 were recruited.
All participants were taking Listening and Speaking II (in addition to other courses). Given
that the Saudi ministry of education suspended schools and universities on the 8th of March,
participants attended eight weeks of traditional learning and about seven weeks of online
learning. As part of the evaluation of their speaking skills in Listening and Speaking II, they
were asked to give presentations roughly 2-5 minutes long. They were notified of each
presentation topic one week in advance to give them time to prepare, and each student gave a
total of eight presentations distributed throughout the semester (six face-to-face and two online
presentations). The students had to stand in front of their classmates to deliver their presentations
face-to-face, but to avoid any psychological pressure their teachers’ comments were provided to
each student privately, and not in front of their classmates. The online presentations had to be
recorded using a camera, and students were asked to stand during their delivery and pretend to be
in a real classroom. The resulting videos were then sent to the teacher by email for assessment,
with teachers’ comments on student presentations also sent by email.
Like previous studies that have examined online learning vs. face-to-face learning (e.g.,
Fansury et al., 2020; Hamad, 2013; Paechter & Maier, 2010), this study used a questionnaire to
collect the data. Students were asked closed-ended questions, and had to choose their answer
from a 5-point Likert scale in which the responses ranged from strongly disagree to disagree,
uncertain, agree and strongly agree. The 21-item questionnaire consisted of four constructs
designed to seek their attitudes towards: a) the importance of speaking in English; b) teachers’

use of email to communicate their feedback on students’ English-speaking tasks; c) online
teaching of English speaking; and d) online learning and teaching of the English language. The
goal of the questionnaire was explained to the participants before it was administered. Because
of the coronavirus pandemic, the questionnaire was administered online.

Teaching English Speaking Online versus Face-to-Face: Saudi Students’

Alzamil

Participants seemed to have positive attitudes to online learning. However, when it came to the
question of whether they preferred online to face-to-face learning, participants seemed to believe
that online learning is less effective than face-to-face learning.
Discussion
This section is organised according to the four constructs in the questionnaire that
addressed the main research questions. These were as follows: a) the importance of speaking in
English; b) teachers’ online feedback; c) online learning of English speaking; d) online learning
of the English language.
In relation to the first construct, the participants either agreed or strongly agreed that
mastering speaking was important for them. They also preferred their teachers to concentrate on
improving their speaking skills. These findings support Ali et al.’s (2019) study.
With regard to the second construct, 50% of participants preferred to receive their teacher’s
feedback on their speaking task face-to-face rather than online. This may be because face-to-face
feedback allows for discussion which is not normally the case with email. However, they
appreciated the fact that receiving the feedback by email allowed them potentially to keep their
teacher’s comments for future use. Moreover, 33.3% of them appreciated the speed with which
they received feedback by email. Yet, neither speed nor the ability to retain email made them
prefer online feedback to face-to-face feedback.
With the third construct, the majority of participants (77.7%) felt that delivering their
speaking tasks online improved their speaking skills. They (83.4%) also thought that videotaping
their speaking tasks allowed them to edit and improve their quality. However, when it came to
preferring online to face-to-face teaching of English speaking, they were divided about whether
they agreed or disagreed, and 55.6% of the participants remained uncertain.
For question 1d, participants agreed or strongly agreed that online learning gave them
greater independence and flexibility (44.5% and 61.1% respectively). However, a majority
(66.6%) opposed the continuation of online learning after the pandemic ends, as most (61.1%)
believe that face-to-face learning is superior to online learning. However, they were not as
opposed, as discussed earlier, to statement 11, ‘I prefer speaking skills to be taught online’,
where their views were split. It could be that their experience with regard to learning speaking
online was different from their experience on other courses: for example, only 16.7% of
participants looked forward to online classes whereas 60% looked forward to face-to-face
learning. Many (61.1%) even reported that online learning facilitates students’ cheating.
Participants were divided about whether online learning is boring, expressing views that ranged
from strongly disagree to strongly agree. This can be explained by remembering that some
students tend to consider all learning, of whatever type, boring.
The findings above support the findings by Paechter and Maier (2010) and Gorra and Bhati
(2016) to the extent that the participants believe that online learning has its benefits and roles in
L2 learning. However, the findings of the present study failed to show that participants preferred
online over face-to-face learning altogether, as did the participants in, for example, Fansury et
al.'s (2020) study.

Conclusion
This study was limited to a small number of participants because the COVID-19 pandemic
meant that some potential participants could not be reached. It addressed the attitudes of
university-level Saudi students towards: a) the importance of speaking English; and) distance
learning and teaching English speaking. Participants had positive views towards the use of
distance learning and teaching and learning English. The findings showed that the participants: a)
had positive attitudes to the importance of speaking English, and b) appreciated the benefits that
online learning offers. Participants did not believe it could replace face-to-face learning.
These results are interesting, in spite of the study’s limitations in terms of the small number
of participants. A larger study is needed to determine whether its outcomes can be reliably
replicated.
