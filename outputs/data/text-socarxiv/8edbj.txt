Abstract
Background: Do young adults have low compliance rates with public health measures aimed
at curbing the spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)? This paper leverages a
prospective-longitudinal cohort study with data before and during the pandemic to examine
this question.

Methods: Data came from an ongoing cohort study (n=737). Non-compliance with public
health measures and concurrent correlates were measured at age 22. Antecedent
sociodemographic, social, and psychological factors were measured at ages 15-20.

Findings: Young adults generally complied with COVID-19 public health measures, although
compliance with some measures (e.g., cleaning/disinfecting mobile phones, standing 1.5-2
meters apart) was relatively lower. Non-compliance, especially with hygiene-related measures,
was more prevalent in males, and in individuals with higher education, higher SES, and a nonmigrant background. Non-compliance was associated with “antisocial potential,” including
pre-pandemic low acceptance of moral rules, legal cynicism, low shame/guilt, low self-control,
engagement in delinquent behaviors, and association with delinquent peers. Young adults with
low trust, including in the government’s measures for fighting the virus, also complied less.

Interpretation: In order to increase voluntary compliance with COVID-19 measures, public
health campaigns should implement strategies that foster moral obligation and trust in
authorities, or leverage trustworthy individuals in the community to disseminate information.
For young adults with low self-control, self-monitoring, environmental restructuring, or
nudging may increase compliance. Long-term investments into integrating antisocial youth
into society may decrease rule-breaking behaviors, including during pandemics when
compliance saves lives.

Funding: The Zurich Project from Childhood to Adulthood is currently supported by the Swiss
National Science Foundation (SNF) [Grant number: 10FI14_170402]. The data collection for
the COVID-19 study was supported by the SNF [Grant number: 10FI14_170402/2].

Non-compliance with COVID-19-related public health measures among young adults:
Insights from a longitudinal cohort study
During the initial weeks of the Coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19] outbreak in Europe,
Switzerland was among the ten most affected countries worldwide, with one of the highest per
capita rates of infection.1 Public health recommendations were first introduced on 28 February;
from 16 March to 26 April 2020, Switzerland went into its first country-wide “lockdown”.
Policies during that time included increased social distance and hygiene, prohibition of social
gatherings of >5 people, and staying home whenever possible.2-3
Adolescents and young adults were identified internationally as a group with potentially
low compliance, especially with social distancing measures.4-5 In mid-March 2020, the WHO
issued a special appeal to young people for increased compliance.6 This group often displays
only mild or no symptoms of COVID-19, while still being infectious.7-8 Thus, their potential
for spreading the virus is high, considering that they also tend to have large social networks
and active social lives.9
Compliance research in this or previous pandemics has typically focused on proximal,
concurrent correlates, including sociodemographic characteristics, perceived risk of
contracting or being harmed by the virus, information-seeking, having trust in the government,
and feeling the moral obligation to comply.10-13 Less is known about how prior social and
psychological risk factors are associated with non-compliance during pandemics. In nonpandemic times, young people’s antisocial potential14—that is low self-control, high
engagement in delinquent behaviors, high association with delinquent peers, low acceptance
of moral rules, legal cynicism, and low shame or guilt—predicts future rule-breaking
behaviors. This makes antisocial potential a strong candidate as a predictor of non-compliance
with measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus.
The predictive ability of antisocial potential is best examined using representative data
featuring information on young people before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The
current analysis thus leverages a prospective-longitudinal study that began data collection years
before the pandemic, and that most recently collected data in April 2020. During the COVID19 pandemic, young adults reported their compliance with public health measures, and
attitudinal and situational characteristics, such as risk-status, information seeking, and trust in
government. Prior to the pandemic, these same participants were extensively characterized in
terms of their sociodemographic characteristics and antisocial potential during their adolescent
and young adult years. We use the data to describe patterns of compliance with COVID-19

3

related public health measures in young adults and to identify which characteristics of
adolescents and young adults increase risk for future and concurrent non-compliance.

METHODS

Sample and Procedures
Data came from the Zurich Project on Social Development from Childhood to Adulthood (zproso), an ongoing prospective-longitudinal study of child and adolescent development. The
cohort comprises children who entered 1st grade in one of the 56 primary schools in Zurich, in
2004. The initial target sample of schools was selected using random sampling procedures in
which disadvantaged school districts were oversampled. The study consists of eight waves of
child interviews at ages 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 20. Details on the original sample selection
and attrition between waves 1 and 7 are available elsewhere.15-16 Most recently, participants
who had participated at the age 20 assessment were invited to participate in a COVID-19 online
study at age 22 years old. The current analysis primarily uses data from the COVID-19, and
the age 15, 17, and 20 assessments. Subjects provided written informed consent for their study
participation at ages 13-20. At age 22, informed consent was obtained online, as an extension
to the age 20 written consent. Until age 15, parents could opt their child out of the study.
The sample for the COVID-19 data collection was based on participants of the z-proso
age 20 assessment. Out of the 1180 participants at age 20, 21 were not contacted due to unclear
status or invalid contact information. Out of the 1159 cases contacted, N=786 participants
responded (67.8% of age 20 sample in 2018; 46.9% of original target sample in 2004). Given
attrition over time, sampling weights were used in all analyses to allow generalizations back to
the original recruitment population (see Supplementary Appendix A for more details). We
excluded those no longer living in Switzerland during the time of the survey and who had
incomplete data on measures of interest here (final sample n=737). Descriptive characteristics
of the weighted sample are reported in Table 1. Notably, 50% of the sample had a migrant
background (i.e. both parents born abroad), which is largely representative of the youth
population in Zurich.
At ages 15, and 17, participants completed paper/pencil questionnaires in classrooms
outside of regular lesson times. At age 20, participants completed surveys on a computer at a
university research laboratory. Interviews typically lasted 90 minutes. Adolescents received a
cash incentive for their participation in each wave: ~$50 at age 15, ~$60 at age 17, and ~$75

4

at age 20. Respondents in the age 22 COVID-19 survey were entered into a lottery with the
opportunity to win one of 50 prizes of ~100$.
Those who had participated at age 20 were sent an invitation with a personalized link
by SMS and e-mail. Data collection began during week 4 of the Swiss lockdown and ended
during week 5. Invitations were sent on 8 April 2020, with reminders on 11 and 13 April. In
total, participants were given 7 days to complete the survey.
Ethical approval was obtained by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Arts and
Social Sciences of the University of Zurich.

Measures
Dependent variable
Non-compliance with COVID-19 public health measures. Respondents were asked whether or
not they adopted 13 protective behaviors, reflecting national and international
recommendations.2-3,17 They can broadly be subdivided into hygiene measures (e.g., wash
hands regularly, use hand disinfectant, cough into an elbow or cloth, do not touch face, wash
hands after coughing or sneezing, disinfect mobile phone) and social distancing behaviors (e.g.,
stay at home, adhere to social distancing [1.5-2 meters]), stay at home with symptoms, avoid
at-risk persons, do not shake hands). Wearing a face mask was included in the survey, but was
excluded from analyses since this was explicitly not recommended by the Swiss government.
Accordingly, only 8% of participants reported wearing a face mask.
For each of the 13 behaviors, respondents indicated whether they followed the
recommendation. A sum score was created to reflect how many of the 13 behaviors the
respondent failed to comply with. Separate sum scores were created for compliance with
hygiene and social distancing measures, respectively.

Sociodemographic variables
We included a range of sociodemographic variables that are relevant for understanding
protective health behaviors and non-compliance: sex, socioeconomic status [SES] and
educational level measured at age 15, and migrant background (see Supplementary Appendix
B for more details).

Antecedent variables
In order to evaluate antecedent predictors of COVID-19 non-compliance, we used information
from the two previous waves of the z-proso study (ages 17 and 20). We briefly describe each
5

variable here; additional detail on the items used and the reliability of each scale is available in
Supplementary Appendix B.
Weak social bonds and active lifestyle. Weak bonds may reflect an individual’s reduced
embeddedness in social networks and less exposure to social pressures to comply. In addition,
an active social lifestyle may increase risk of non-compliance with social distancing measures.
We used eight variables to measure elements of weak social bonds and social lifestyle: low
parental involvement, low parental monitoring, low teacher-student bonds, low school
commitment, low social support, perceived social exclusion, low generalized trust, and active
social lifestyle (e.g. meeting with friends, practicing sports). Parent- and school-related
variables were measured at age 17; exclusion, trust, and social lifestyle were measured at age
20.
Attitudes towards the law and police. We used two measures that capture attitudes
towards the law and police (measured at age 20) which can be indicative of an individual’s
broader willingness to accept formal authorities and directives: low police legitimacy and legal
cynicism.
Deviant peers and antisocial behavior. Two of the most important individual
antecedents of rule-breaking are prior rule-breaking and affiliation with deviant peers.18-19 We
therefore included measures of prior antisocial behavior and deviant peers measured at age 20.
Dispositional factors. We included three dispositional factors as important predictors
of health and risk behaviors measured at age 20: low self-control, low self-efficacy, and low
feelings of guilt or shame.12,20

Concurrent variables
Two items were used to measure risk of infection. Respondents were asked whether they or a
family member had a pre-existing condition that increases their risk or seriousness of infection.
Two measures captured the respondent’s broader perceptions about low social compliance (i.e.
social norms) and low moral norms regarding whether certain non-compliant behaviors are
wrong. The COVID-19 moral disengagement scale reflects attitudes that underestimate or
dismiss the risk of infection. The low trust in government scale was included to capture the
respondent’s views on Swiss authorities in relation to the outbreak. Finally, low informationseeking was measured by a single item that asks respondents how often he/she sought out news
or information about COVID-19 in the two weeks prior to the survey (see Supplementary
Appendix B for additional details on the items used and reliability of each scale).

6

Analytical strategy
Compared to the previous wave (age 20), an attrition analysis showed significantly higher
response rates in the age 22 COVID-19 survey by women compared to men, and in (local)
German speakers compared to participants other linguistic backgrounds (which serves as a
proxy indicator for migrant background). Therefore, sampling weights were used in all
analyses to allow the generalization of results to the original target sample.
Analyses were conducted in two stages. All analyses used binomial generalized linear
model [GLM] regressions with a logit-link function. Binomial regression techniques tend to
perform better when analyzing sum scores (i.e. bounded count data) compared to traditional or
Poisson regression approaches.21 First, we examined differences in compliance behaviors by
sociodemographic characteristics. Specifically, we estimated the likelihood of each noncompliance behavior by sex, and then examined the likelihood of overall, hygiene, and social
distancing non-compliance by education level, sex, SES quartiles, and migrant background.
Estimates were computed using sampling weights, and adjusting for other sociodemographic
characteristics. The odds ratios [ORs] therefore reflect the adjusted odds of an additional noncompliance behavior in a given group compared to the reference group. Unadjusted and
adjusted estimates are available in Supplementary Appendix C.
Second, we estimated bivariate associations between both antecedent and concurrent
factors with non-compliance. In these analyses, the sociodemographic characteristics described
above were adjusted. The resulting ORs reflect the odds of an additional non-compliance
behavior given a one-unit increase in the independent variable. All analyses were conducted
accounting for sample weights.
Missing data was low, with missingness for most variables ranging from 0% (e.g.,
compliance items) to 3% (e.g., parental monitoring). Four variables with the highest
missingness were teacher-child bond (9%), school commitment (9%), social exclusion (9%),
and deviant peers (11%). In order to assess whether results were influenced by missing data,
we conducted multiple imputation using chained equations, which can handle different types
of complex (bounded) data.22 Using the variables included in the analyses as predictors, we
imputed 10 complete datasets and re-estimated all analyses with full information (n=737). The
substantive results remained the same, so we present the results for the listwise analyses
(imputed results are available in the Supplementary Appendix D).

RESULTS

Prevalence of non-compliance by sociodemographic characteristics
Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for the weighted sample. Overall, non-compliance was
relatively low: On average, respondents reported failing to comply with 2 to 3 (out of 13)
COVID-19-related measures (M=2.47, SE=0.07). Non-compliance with hygiene-related
COVID-19 measures was reported more often (M=1.77, SE=0.05) than non-compliance with
social distancing measures (M=0.71, SE=0.04).

[Table 1]

Table 2 provides additional detailed information about average levels of noncompliance with each COVID-19 measure, stratified by sex. For the full sample, noncompliance varied across specific hygiene and social distancing measures. Non-compliance
was more prevalent for certain hygiene measures, such as cleaning or disinfecting one’s mobile
phone (53%), washing one’s hands after coughing or sneezing (53%), avoiding touching one’s
face (35%), and using hand disinfectant (27%). Conversely, non-compliance was low for
coughing or sneezing into one’s elbow (3%), and washing one’s hands regularly (5%). Noncompliance for social distancing measures ranged from 3% (staying at home with symptoms)
to 18% (adhering to 1.5-2 meter social distancing guidelines). Table 2 also shows that noncompliance is generally greater among males compared to females, however this varies by
behavior. Specifically, there were no significant differences (p>.05) found for regular
handwashing, adhering to social distancing guidelines, avoiding contact with people at risk,
only using public transport when necessary, and staying at home with symptoms (see Table 2).

[Table 2]

Adjusted odds ratios for hygiene, social distancing, and overall COVID-19 noncompliance levels by sociodemographic characteristics are presented in Table 3. Males were
43% more likely to report an additional non-compliance behavior compared to females (overall
non-compliance OR=1.43, p<0.001). Non-compliance with hygiene measures was lower in
respondents from low and medium (i.e. ORsecondary

A(medium)=0.76;

ORsecondary

B/C(low)=0.63)

compared to higher educational backgrounds (i.e. Gymnasium). By contrast, respondents in
the medium educational tracks (secondary A) were 42% (p=0.060) and respondents in the low
educational track (secondary B/C) were 93% more likely (p<0.001) to report additional social
distancing non-compliance behaviors compared to respondents with higher education (college8

track). Respondents with high SES were more likely to report hygiene non-compliance
(ORQuartile4(high)=1.63, p<0.001), but there were no differences for social distancing noncompliance. Respondents with a migration background were 25% less likely to report
additional hygiene non-compliance compared to respondents with at least one parent born in
Switzerland, but there were no differences in social distancing non-compliance.

[Table 3]

Effects of antecedent and concurrent factors on non-compliance
Adjusted ORs and 95% confidence intervals for antecedent and concurrent factors on overall
non-compliance are visualized in Figure 1. All point estimates, 95% confidence intervals, and
p-values for unadjusted and adjusted effects are available in Supplementary Appendix C.
Overall, several antecedents are consistently associated with both types of non-compliance,
even when adjusting for sociodemographic factors: legal cynicism (overall OR=1.27,
p<0.001), deviant peers (overall OR=1.16, p<0.001), antisocial behavior (overall OR=1.10,
p<0.001), and low guilt/shame (overall OR=1.19, p=0.003). For example, with each additional
antisocial behavior reported (e.g. steal something from a shop, take illegal drugs) the odds of
reporting an additional non-compliance behavior increased by 10%. Concurrent factors
associated with non-compliance included low feelings of moral obligation (overall OR=1.48,
p<0.001), COVID-19 moral disengagement (overall OR=1.82, p<0.001), and low informationseeking behavior (overall OR=1.13, p<0.001).

[Figure 1]

Adjusted ORs and 95% confidence intervals for hygiene and social distancing noncompliance respectively are presented in Figure 2. The results suggested that certain antecedent
and concurrent factors influence hygiene and social distancing non-compliance to different
degrees. We did not identify factors that were robustly associated with hygiene non-compliance
only. By contrast, other antecedent and concurrent factors appeared to be uniquely associated
with social distancing non-compliance: low parental monitoring (OR=1.47, p=0.003), low
police legitimacy (OR=1.40, p<0.001), low self-control (OR=2.03, p<0.001), and low trust in
government (OR=1.90, p<0.001). Association between low generalized trust and noncompliance varied by type of behavior. Low generalized trust was associated with a lower

9

likelihood of hygiene non-compliance (OR=0.90, p=0.074), but an increased likelihood of
social distancing non-compliance (OR=1.37, p=0.002).

DISCUSSION

Understanding characteristics of young people who do not comply with COVID-19-related
public health measures is essential for developing effective public health campaigns in the
current and future pandemics. We leveraged data from a longitudinal cohort study with data
before and during the COVID-19 pandemic to examine antecedent and concurrent factors
associated with non-compliance. Results showed that rates of compliance with COVID-19related measures in a representative sample of young adults were relatively high, and slightly
better for social distancing than hygiene measures. Non-compliance was higher among males,
those with a higher education level, higher SES, and non-migrant background. These
associations were primarily driven by associations with non-compliance in hygiene-related
measures.
Analyses of antecedent and concurrent risk factors suggested that non-compliance was
associated with a cluster of behaviours sometimes termed “antisocial potential”: low
acceptance of moral rules, legal cynicism, low shame or guilt, low self-control, high
engagement in delinquent behaviors, and association with delinquent peers.14 Public health
measures have in the past appealed to social pressure and moral obligations to motivate
compliance.13 Our results support these approaches. The factors related to antisocial potential
are considered by some to be less malleable in the short term making them less suitable for
intervention. Although it is unlikely that public health campaigns can effectively change an
individual’s antisocial potential in emergency situations such as the current pandemic, it is
possible to manage the effects of certain antisocial risk factors in the short term. For example,
evidence suggests that the effect of low self-control can be attenuated by intervention strategies
that aim to manage deficits in self-control through self-monitoring, environmental
restructuring, or nudging.23
In addition, our results suggest that hygiene and social distancing behaviors are in part
driven by different mechanisms. For example, negative attitudes towards authorities (i.e. low
police legitimacy, low trust in government) were associated with increased social distancing
non-compliance but not hygiene non-compliance. This has important implications for public
10

health policies and campaigns that aim to motivate compliance with COVID-19-related
measures. Compliance with social distancing measures involves greater or more restrictive
behavioral change, with direct consequences for psychological, social, and economic wellbeing.4,24 Adopting these behavioral changes may therefore be perceived as too burdensome
without adequate trust and belief that authorities are fair and effective in implementing
restrictive rules. In addition, trust may indirectly motivate compliance by increasing an
individual’s perception of risk.12
Our results suggest that there are some areas of non-compliance that require additional
attention from public health campaigns. Non-compliance with certain protective measures,
such as avoiding groups, coughing or sneezing into one’s elbow, and washing one’s hands
regularly, was generally low. This implies that the message was effectively disseminated and
young people were generally receptive to these measures. However, non-compliance with
certain hygiene and social distancing measures were relatively higher, including cleaning and
disinfecting mobile phones or standing 1.5-2 meters apart. Cleaning mobile phones was not an
“official” recommendation by Swiss authorities, which may partly explain lower levels of
compliance regarding these hygiene measures. Nevertheless cleaning environmental surfaces,
including mobile phones, has been recommended by international public health authorities and
media outlets as a protective measure against the spread of the virus.17,25 Public health
campaigns should address these aspects of non-compliance, for example by improving the
awareness and understanding of the virus on smartphones and other methods of transmission.26
Finally, analyses of non-compliance by sociodemographic characteristics indicated that
males are less likely to comply with both hygiene and social distancing measures. This is an
important finding given that the available evidence suggests that COVID-19 mortality rates are
higher for men compared to women.27 Furthermore, our results showed that non-migrant
background and high-SES young people were less likely to comply with hygiene measures, but
not social distancing measures. This may in part reflect what is known as the “immigrant health
paradox,” whereby first- and second-generation migrants tend to report fewer risky health
behaviors and better health outcomes than natives.28 Hygiene practices may also depend on
situational, household, or occupational characteristics that may influence the risk of infection.
For example, migrant background or low SES/education individuals may be more likely to
work in service sector positions that are considered “essential”, increasing exposure to
environmental risks. Low SES or education groups also face higher barriers to compliance with
social distancing rules, such as staying home or avoiding public transport, due to economic
hardship and the fear of losing income.13 Social distancing non-compliance among these
11

groups may be even higher in contexts that lack a strong social safety net or compensation for
lost wages.29
The current study has several strengths, most notably its broadly representative sample
and measures of social and psychological antecedent risk factors. Limitations include that the
sample is not necessarily representative of other areas of Switzerland or other countries.
Furthermore, while the COVID-19-related measures in Switzerland are generally in line with
global recommendations, there are important differences in policies and information which
may influence non-compliance. For example, some countries and cities require face masks to
be worn when going outside,30 whereas this was not recommended in Switzerland. Noncompliance with certain measures may therefore vary by the specific public health campaigns
and official recommendations in each region.
Overall, our findings suggest that young people are largely complying with COVID-19
public health measures in Zurich. Non-compliance was strongly associated with weaker
feelings of moral obligation and low trust in authorities, but also with high antisocial potential.
Public health campaigns can implement strategies that foster moral obligation and trust in
authorities, or leverage trustworthy individuals in the community to disseminate information.
Our results suggested that it is also important to implement strategies that address the factors
related to antisocial potential such as self-control. This can be accomplished for example
through self-monitoring or environmental restructuring (or “nudging”) to promote protective
health habits and behaviors.23

Nivette et al. Non-compliance with COVID-19-related public health measures among
young adults: Insights from a longitudinal cohort study
*Preprint materials: 2 May 2020

Supplementary Appendix A: Information on sample weighting
The analysis of participation showed significantly higher response rates in women compared to men,
and in (local) German speakers compared to other linguistic backgrounds (which serves as a proxy
indicator for migrant background). We therefore created weights based on these respondent
characteristics, which were available for the entire target sample of the initial z-proso study (i.e.
including non-participants). Specifically, three groups were differentiated for each gender, in which one
group had young people from German speaking backgrounds with the highest participation rate
(55.2%), one group of young people from linguistic or cultural backgrounds with intermediate
participation rate (49%, including English, Italian, Tamil, Turkish, and “other languages”), and one
group of young people from backgrounds with low participation rates (34.4%, including Albanian,
Serbo-Croatian, Spanish, Portuguese). Group size ranged from 71 cases to 197 cases, and weighting
factors from 0.719 to 1.791. Information on weights for specific groups is available in the online
supplement. The application of weights to the current sample means the results are comparable to the
initial target sample, which is broadly representative of the age cohort in Zurich.

Supplementary Appendix B: Information on sociodemographic characteristics,
antecedent and concurrent variables used in the analyses
Sociodemographic characteristics
Sex was coded 0 for females and 1 for males. Socioeconomic status [SES] was measured based on the
primary caregiver’s occupation when the respondent was 15 years old or younger. Codes were
transformed into an International Socioeconomic Index of occupational status (ISEI) score.1 The
respondent’s SES score was based on the highest ISEI recorded for each household, and was divided
into quartiles for analysis. The respondent’s educational track level was measured at age 15.
Respondents who were in Gymnasium (highest, college-track level) were the reference group (coded
0), compared to lower level education groups: secondary school A (higher non-college track, typically
leading to “white collar” apprenticeships), secondary school B/C (lower non-college track, typically
leading to “blue collar” apprenticeships), and special needs education, respectively. Migrant
background was coded 0 for respondents with at least one parent born in Switzerland, and 1 for those
with both parents born abroad.
Antecedent variables
Weak social bonds and active lifestyle. Strong bonds may reflect an individual’s embeddedness in social
networks and consequently exposure to social pressure to comply. We used eight variables to measure
elements of weak social bonds and active social lifestyle: low parental involvement, low parental
monitoring, low teacher-student bonds, low school commitment, low social support, social exclusion,
low generalized trust, and social leisure activities. Parent- and school-related variables were measured
at age 17, whereas exclusion, trust, and leisure activities were measured at age 20. Low parental
involvement is a proxy for family bonds consisting of six items measuring how often an adolescent’s
parents talked, comforted, and showed interest in them. Low parental monitoring consisted of seven
items capturing aspects of parental supervision and control. The low teacher-student bond scale
consisted of three items measuring the quality of the adolescent’s relationship with their current teacher.
School commitment was a four-item scale that reflects a more general measure of an adolescent’s bond
to school. A four-item low social support scale was included to capture the respondent’s access to
trustworthy social ties for problem-solving and support. Social exclusion was a proxy for an individual’s
bonds to society. The scale consisted of six items measuring feelings of segregation, alienation,
isolation, and worthlessness. The low generalized trust scale consisted of three items capturing feelings
that people can be trusted and try to help people. An active social lifestyle may increase the risk of noncompliance, as individuals are motivated to maintain this lifestyle by e.g. leaving the home to engage
in social gatherings. An individual’s active social lifestyle was measured using 17 items that capture
structured and unstructured routine activities outside the home, including meeting friends and practicing
sports.
Attitudes towards the law and police. We used two measures that capture attitudes towards the
law and police can be indicative of an individual’s broader willingness to accept and comply with formal
authorities and directives: low police legitimacy and legal cynicism. Low police legitimacy was
measured using three items that reflect dimensions of police performance, fairness, and confidence in
police effectiveness. Legal cynicism reflects the belief that the law is not binding. The legal cynicism
scale consisted of six items that capture justifications for acting outside the law.
Deviant peers and antisocial behavior. In order to capture the influence of delinquent peers,
respondents were asked about the delinquent behavior of their two ‘best friends’ (e.g. kick/hit and injure
somebody, steal something from a shop, take illegal drugs). For each respondent, the mean score of the
six items was constructed based on one or both best friends. Respondents who reported they did not
have a best friend were treated as missing (n=26, 3.5%). The range was 0 to 1, so the variable was ztransformed to ease interpretation. A one-unit increase therefore reflects a one-standard deviation
increase in deviant peer behavior. Prior antisocial behavior measured using a composite score of the
respondent’s involvement in 16 different antisocial behaviors in the year prior to the survey (i.e.
between ages 19 and 20). Antisocial behaviors include bullying, truancy, substance use, theft, and
violence.
25

Dispositional factors. We included three dispositional factors, low self-control, low selfefficacy, and low guilt/shame, as important predictors of health and risk behaviors. Low self-control
was measured using 10 items including five sub-dimensions of self-control (i.e. impulsivity, selfcenteredness, risk-seeking, preference for physical activities, and short temper). The low self-efficacy
scale consisted of five items that reflect an individual’s feelings of control and confidence in achieving
goals. Low feelings of shame or guilt were captured using three items that ask respondents to what
extent they feel bad or guilty when they have done wrong.
Concurrent variables
Two items were used to measure risk of infection. The respondents were asked whether they or a family
member had a pre-existing condition that increases their risk or seriousness of infection. The
respondent’s attitudes about broader social non-compliance (i.e. social norms) were measured using a
single item that capture perceptions about others’ behavior during the outbreak. Moral norms were
measured using four items that indicate whether the respondent believes certain non-compliant
behaviors are wrong. The four-item COVID-19 moral disengagement reflected attitudes that
underestimate or dismiss the risk of infection. The trust in government scale consisted of three items
capturing the respondent’s views on Swiss authorities in relation to the outbreak. Finally, informationseeking was measured by a single item that asks respondents how often he/she sought out news or
information about COVID-19 in the two weeks prior to the survey.
All scales were constructed by taking the mean of the respective items. Reliability statistics are
reported in Supplementary Table 2. A Cronbach’s alpha >.70 is considered acceptable.
