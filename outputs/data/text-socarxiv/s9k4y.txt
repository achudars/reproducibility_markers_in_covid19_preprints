Abstract
The recent COVID-19 pandemic led to uncertainty and severe health and economic concerns.
Previous studies indicated that owning a companion animal, such as a dog or a cat, has benefits for
good mental health. Interactions with animals may help with depression, anxiety, and stress, in
particular under stress-prone conditions. Companion animals provide companionship, improve mood,
and may ease loneliness; human-animal interactions may even improve peer-to-peer social
relationships, as well as enhance feelings such as respect, trust, and empathy between people.
Interestingly, it has also been shown that stress and poor well-being of dog owners negatively affect
the stress and well-being of their companion animals. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the COVID19 pandemic, and the related social isolation, might lead to dramatic changes in human-dog
bidirectional relationships. Using unique prospective and retrospective datasets, our objectives were
to investigate how people perceived and acted during the COVID-19 pandemic social isolation, in
regards to dog adoption and abandonment; and to examine the bidirectional relationships between
dog owners’ well-being to that of their dogs. Overall, according to our analysis, the stricter the social
isolation became during the pandemic, the interest in dog adoption as well as adoption rate increased
significantly, while abandonment did not change. Moreover, there was a clear association between
individuals’ impaired quality of life and their perceptions of poorer life quality of their dogs as well
as the development of new behavioral problems. These findings suggest potential benefits for humandog relationship during the COVID-19 pandemic, in compliance with the One Welfare approach.

Introduction
The virus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in December 2019, in Wuhan, China. This unknown
respiratory disease developed into the pandemic, termed COVID-19, as declared by the World Health
Organization on March 2020 (1). One of the main approaches worldwide for combating the disease
is social isolation and distancing, at least as long as a protective vaccine is not available (2-4). Social
isolation may prevent the spread of the disease, but it may also come with other concerns. One of the
greatest concerns regarding the influence of social isolation is its psychological effect on humans.
Extended social isolation may lead to a significant decrease in quality of life and well-being, and high
levels of stress, also among the non-infected populations (4, 5). Social isolation is an additional
stressor to an already highly stressful world environment and many people’s extensive fear of the
novel COVID-19 pandemic threat (4, 6, 7). In addition, social distancing included full lockdowns in
many countries, as well as in Israel, with dramatic economic effects (8, 9). The adverse local and
global economic impacts, on top of the drastic personal income reduction, may add another
psychological aspect to the potential impairment of people's health and well-being (5).
Interestingly, the mental health benefits of owning a companion animal, such as a dog or a
cat, have been shown by several scientific studies over the last years (10-12). The majority of studies
point out that interactions with animals may help with depression, anxiety, and stress, in particular
under stress-prone conditions (11). Companion animals provide companionship, improve mood, and
may ease loneliness; human-animal interactions may even improve peer-to-peer social relationships,
as well as enhance feelings such as respect, trust, and empathy between people (11-13). Paradoxically,
it has also been shown that stress and poor well-being negatively affect the stress and well-being of
their companion animals (14-16). For example, it was indicated that the stress of the owner could
influence their dog's cognitive ability (15). Moreover, changes in the owners' attention to their dogs
may affect the dogs’ behavior (17, 18). Therefore, we hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic
might lead to dramatic changes in human-dog bidirectional relationships. On the one hand, owning a
dog may assist the owner in coping with the stressful world situation, and therefore, more people may
decide to adopt a dog during this pandemic. On the other hand, behavioral problems in dogs were
reported to be one of the main reasons for the abandonment of dogs to shelters (19, 20); if changes in
the owners’ lives occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, and indeed if behavioral problems in
their dogs developed as was shown under other circumstances(15), then, this may increase the risk
for dog relinquishment.
Another potential risk factor for dog abandonment and relinquishment during the COVID-19
pandemic was their suspected epidemiological role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2. There was a
worldwide growing concern that companion animals, specifically dogs and cats, can transmit the
2

disease to humans (21-23). Although the anecdotal reports were inconclusive, potentially, it could
lead to an increase in the number of dogs relinquished by their owners. Thus, overall, the inconclusive
reports of companion animals being potential carriers of the COVID-19 virus, the economic crisis,
and the general stress and panic during this pandemic, could potentially cause a dramatic increase in
dog abandonment numbers. Such a scenario may come along with high costs and considerable risk
to public health, and therefore should have been explored. Relinquishment and abandonment of
companion animals is a global problem; it is estimated that millions of pets are being abandoned each
year (24), even without a pandemic in the background. It results in increasing numbers of freeroaming, overcrowded animal shelters, impaired animal welfare, and carries high costs to tax payers
(24). Moreover, it is a severe public health issue due to the potential transmission of zoonotic diseases
(such as rabies) and attacks of people (25, 26). All of these threats also carry remarkable economic
consequences, which affect national and local governments, humane organizations, as well as
individuals (25).
In 2012, an online, searchable database of animals that need homes in Israel was established
(http://Yad4.co.il) by the first author, on a voluntary basis. The first and only project of its kind in
Israel, Yad4, serves as a national database for dog adoption, as it includes the vast majority of
abandoned dogs that need homes throughout the country. As such, the established database provides
both an understanding of the current landscape of dog abandonment and adoption at any given
moment, as well as a unique look into the longitudinal relationships of dogs and people as the same
dogs may be tracked across time, multiple homes, and shelter visits. The Yad4 initiative aims to
rescue the lives of abandoned animals in Israel by increasing adoption rates, reducing the extent of
dog euthanasian, shortening the length of stay at the shelters until adoption, and has no profits
purposes. The website offers a user-friendly search engine for potential adopters, with available dogs
from organizations and municipal shelters across the country of Israel. The information is uploaded
and updated by animal welfare organizations and municipal veterinarians, typically as soon as they
have the dog in their possession. As of 2020, 72 animal welfare organizations and municipal shelters
are registered and active on the website, each managing its own pool of adoptable pets independently,
with its own online account. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the website was operated as usual;
however, initially, there was a concern for massive abandonment and a decrease in adoption.
In order to control the pandemic, gradual social restrictions initiated during March 2020 in
Israel, while in April, a total lockdown was implemented for a full month by the Israeli government,
as marked on the timeline in Fig. 1. During this period, walking the dog and veterinary care were
exceptions for the lockdown restrictions, as well as dog adoptions from animal welfare organizations
and municipal shelters. Therefore, while it was not allowed to be outside of a 100 m radius from your
house, dog adoption and dog walking were always permitted throughout these periods.

According to the mentioned above, the objectives of this study were: (1) to investigate how
COVID-19 pandemic affected adoption and abandonment of dogs into shelters, and the public's
general interest in adopting a dog; (2) to examine the correspondence between the owners 'and their
dogs 'quality of life during the pandemic, as well as (3) its effect on the recognition of new behavioral
problems and relinquishment rate of dogs by their owners.

The different colors, which get darker, represent the various periods analyzed in this study (x-axis): before the
COVID-19 outbreak in China (years 2016-2019; light grey); from the initial outbreak in China until the first
diagnosed patient in Israel (dark grey); during the outbreak in Israel, from the diagnosis of the first COVID19 patient until lockdown declared by the Israeli government (light brown); during the full lockdown for a
month (brown); and the gradual opening on May (grey, on the right side of the figure). The daily number of
new diagnosed COVID-19 patients in Israel is represented as red dots.

Results
The current study focused on a new aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic by investigating the
human-dog relationship under this crisis. Dog adoptions, abandonment, as well as the correspondence
between the well-being of the owners and their perceptions of their dogs’ quality of life, were
examined. Overall, in contrast to some of the initial concerns, all dog adoption measures significantly
improved as the social restrictions became stricter. Furthermore, there was a clear association between
individuals’ quality of life and their perceptions of their dog quality of life and behavior, as well as
the probability of relinquishing it.

Changes in dog adoption and abandonment
The database of Yad4 website was analyzed in order to investigate dog abandonment and
adoptions under the growing pressure of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most abandoned dogs which are
offered for adoption in Israel are published on Yad4 website, which includes most animal welfare
organizations and municipal shelters for dogs. Therefore, the dogs uploaded on a daily basis to the
website represent the abandoned dog population, which includes mainly dogs that were relinquished
by their owners. Overall, according to our analysis, the stricter the social restrictions became during
the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, the number of potential adopters (people looking to adopt a dog),
as well as dog adoption rate, increased significantly (Fig. 2); while dog abandonment did not change.
Multiple Linear Regression analyses of Yad4 records from January 2016 to May 2020 revealed that
the main periods during the development of the pandemic in Israel were significantly associated with
influence on dog adoption measures, while the abandonment rate did not change (Fig. 2;
Supplementary Table 1). The number of dogs uploaded to the website, which represents most of the
abandoned dogs in Israel, did not change significantly over the years, including during the COVID19 pandemic (Fig. 2a-c). On the contrary, adoption measures were significantly affected by the
different periods (Fig. 2d-i), particularly after the first COVID-19 patient in Israel was diagnosed,
and even to a further extent during the social lockdown. Between the time that the first patient in
Israel was diagnosed to the full lockdown of the country, the average number of adoption requests
submitted online was 31.1±1.9 (Mean±SEM) requests per day, during the total lockdown, the average
number of dog adoption requests was 111.3±4.1 requests per day, and during the gradual opening on
May 73±4.6 adoption requests were submitted per day. However, before the COVID-19 outbreak in
China, the average number of dog adoption requests was only 25.7±4.1 requests per day. The Linear
Regression analysis revealed that after controlling the effects of the month, the year and governmental
initiatives for the encouragement of responsible dog ownership between 2018 to 2019, the increase
in the number of adoption requests during the outbreak in Israel, and the full lockdown, were
significantly higher as compared to the period before the COVID-19 outbreak in China (P<0.05; Fig.
2d-f; Supplementary Table 1). Accordingly, the average number of adopted dogs increased
significantly already after the outbreak in China, as well as during the outbreak in Israel and the full
lockdown, as compared to before the pandemic (P<0.05; Fig. 2g-i; Supplementary Table 1). After the
outbreak in China, the average daily number of adopted dogs was 17.3±2.2 dogs per day, during the
outbreak in Israel it was 22.8±2.1 adopted dogs per day, during the total lockdown it was 26.1±2.2
adopted dogs per day, and after the gradual opening it was 14.7±1.1, which is similar to the period
before the COVID outbreak in China (14.1±0.3 adopted dogs per day). Furthermore, as compared to
the years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the length of stay (LOS) of the dog at the shelter,
calculated by the interval from the time the dog was uploaded online to Yad4 website until it was
5

marked by the organizations as adopted, was significantly shorter following the media reported about
the COVID-19 outbreak in China and after (with the shortest LOS of 10.1±0.5 days during the full
lockdown). Potential effects such as the month, the year, and governmental initiatives were controlled
in the Linear Regression models (Supplementary Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 1; P<0.05).

lower row (panels g-i)- number of adopted dogs (marked in green). Daily data is presented on the first and
second columns. Each dot represents the daily number of each parameter, to demonstrate trends over time. In
the left column (panels a,d,g), data are presented from 2016 until May 2020. On the middle column (panels
b,e,h) data are presented as zoom-in, from November 2019 to May 2020. Period of times related to the COVID19 pandemic are separated by colors, as detailed in Fig. 1. In the right column (panels c,f,i), the results of
Multivariate Linear Regression models are presented. In these models, the predictors were: the different time
periods, from the outbreak in China to outbreak in Israel, the developments in Israel until full lockdown, full
lockdown, and gradual opening; each period was compared to the period prior to COIVD-19 pandemic (from
2016 until the outbreak in China, represented by the horizontal dotted line); controlled for year, month, and
governmental initiatives for dog adoption on 2019. The data are presented as coefficients (large dots) and its
95% confidence interval (bars); P<0.05.

Another option available for the public on Yad4 website was to fill a request to serve as a
foster family, as an alternative to adoption. Usually, the demand for foster families among the
organizations is very high, but the number of available foster families is low. Therefore, typically,
there are no available foster families that the organizations do not use. During the pandemic period,
the number of foster families was higher than the demand. Accordingly, from the reports about the
outbreak in China until the end of the lockdown in Israel, as well as during the gradual opening, the
number of available foster families increased significantly. For example, as described in Fig. 3a-b,
by the end of April 2019 there were no available foster families on Yad4 website, since they were all
occupied and used by the organizations; contrarily, at the time of the outbreak in China, 226 foster
families were available but did not receive a dog to foster, and by the end of April 2020, there were
844 available foster families.

Local and global online searches for adoptable dogs
The daily number of visitors on Yad4 website since the first diagnosed COVID-19 patient in
Israel until the end of the full lockdown was significantly higher, as compared to the whole period
before the pandemic (Fig. 3). The effect of year and month were controlled in the models (Sup Table
1). Linear Regression model revealed that there was a significant increase in daily visits online when
the outbreak emerged in Israel during March by 657.9±80.8 (coefficient ± SE) visits, and by
2,311±82.1 daily visitors online during the total lockdown period (Fig. 3a-c; P<0.05). For example,
the absolute number of visits online in April 2020 was 221,959 visits, as compared to 72,703 in April
2019, and 91,920 visits in October 2019, which is typically the busiest season of the website.
Interestingly, according to global non-scientific media reports, the demand for adoptable dogs
worldwide was also high in other countries. Pictures of empty cages from many countries were
published, but until now, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, no scientific data has yet been
published. Thus, the global trend was investigated by analyzing Google Trends data for searches all
around the world, as well as specifically in the USA. In order to do so, the timeline was divided to
three periods: (1) before the outbreak in China; (2) from the media reports about the outbreak in China
on December 27th until March 13th - when the World Health Organization (WHO) announcement of
Europe as the epicenter of the pandemic; (2) the main lockdown worldwide - from the announcement
of the WHO until the gradual opening on May; and (4) during May. The effect of year and month
were controlled in the models (Supplementary Table 2). Interestingly, the world trends, according to
the Google Trends data, were found to be similar to that we report herein for Israel (Fig. 3). The
trends of worldwide searches online for “adopt a dog” were significantly higher during the periods of
the outbreak in China, as well as during the period many countries declared lockdowns, as compared
to the year of 2019 (Fig, 3d-f).

and gradual opening; each period was compared to the period prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (from 2016
until the outbreak in China, represented by the horizontal dotted line); controlled for: year, month, and

May 2020. Each period was compared to the period from January 2019 to the outbreak in China (represented
by the horizontal dotted line); controlled for: year and month. In panels c and f, data are presented as
coefficients (large dots) and its 95% confidence interval (bars); P<0.05.

Given the discovered high demand for dogs to adopt during the pandemic, the second part of
our study included questionnaires targeting people who adopted a dog, as well as to current dog
owners, to explore the motivation behind this increase in demand for adoptable dogs.

The motivation for dog adoptions during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, and the return rate of
dogs back to shelters after the gradual opening
An online questionnaire was carried out in order to explore reasons for dog adoption,
particularly during the COVID-19 related lockdown, as well as to explore the return rate of the
adopted dogs to the shelters, during the lockdown, and after opening. This questionnaire was active
for five days, starting on May 20th, 2020 (20 days after the gradual opening of the lockdown), and
targeted people who adopted a dog from a shelter during the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire
targeted individuals who adopted a dog as described in Methods, with the resulting n=508 people in
total; 312 of respondents stated they adopted during the pandemic (January-May). Of these 312
adopters, 38.5% participants stated they have considered adopting a dog for a long time, and being at
home during the COVID-19 lockdown seemed like a good opportunity; 37.8% stated they planned to
adopt a dog regardless the situation; 8.0% stated they felt lonely and/or stressed and believed that
owning a dog might help; 9.3% heard about dog abandonment in the media and felt it was the right
thing to do; and fewer people adopted for other reasons, as detailed in Fig. 4. Only 8 out of the
participants who adopted during the pandemic (2.6%) already returned or relinquished the dog or
have been considering relinquishment.

Reasons for dog adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic
The frequencies of the participants’ statements for the reason to adopt specifically during the pandemic are
presented. Reasons related to the pandemic are marked in red. Other reasons are presented in black.

The association between owners’ impaired quality of life to their perception of their dogs’ quality
of life
In order to study the correspondence between the quality of life of owners and their
companion dogs under the COVID-19 pandemic circumstances, a digital questionnaire for dog
owners was active during the full lockdown and social isolation (April). Participants replied to
questions regarding their own well-being, as well as the well-being of their companion dog. Questions
9

such as the effect of the pandemic on their stress level, personal economic damage, their concern
about their own health, and their perceptions regarding their dog well-being and behavior under the
COVID-19 related lockdown, were included. The questionnaire also included background questions
about the owners and their dogs, as well as the care they provided to their dog during the pandemic,
that were controlled in the models (details in Supplementary Table 3). The questionnaire was
answered by n = 3,138 individuals; and the outcome variables answers were set on a scale of 1-5 (for
example, 1- low stress; 5- extremely stressed). Scores 4 and 5 were relabeled as “severe stress” for
the analyses, and they were compared to scores 1-3: “none to moderate”. Overall, 25% of the
participants were very concerned about their health (Fig. 5a), 25.6% stated they were extremely
stressed (Fig. 5b), and 22.9% reported that their personal economy was severely damaged (Fig. 5c).
For further analysis, impaired quality of life index was calculated as the mean of these scores (general
stress; concern for their own health; and the damage to their personal economy; Fig. 5d). In addition,
in the questionnaire, owners were asked to rank on a scale of 1-5 their assessment for their dogs’
quality of life during the COVID-19 lockdown, as well as their recognition of new behavioral
problems, and whether they consider relinquishing their dog.
As hypothesized, Multiple Multivariate Logistic Regressions revealed that an increase in the
impaired quality of life index of the owner was associated with lower life quality of the dog, as was
assessed by the owner (odds ratio: 0.887 times lower for every one-unit increase in owner's quality
of life index; Fig. 5e; P<0.05). In addition, for a one-unit increase in impaired quality of life index of
the owner, the odds ratio for recognition of new behavioral problems of the dog (as defined and
recognized by the owner) was 1.397 times higher (Fig. 5e; P<0.05). Moreover, for a one-unit increase
in the impaired quality of life index of the owner, the odds ratio for relinquishment was 1.762 times
higher (Fig. 5d; P<0.05). Overall, the number of people that recognized behavioral problems among
their dogs was low (11.6% of the dog owners), as well as the number of people that intend to
relinquish their dog (1%). Still, according to these data, severely impaired quality of life of owners
under the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown was a significant risk factor to the dog's life quality,
as well as for the recognition of dog's behavioral problems, and dog relinquishment, as reported by
dog owners. Parameters of dogs' and owners' backgrounds, as well as ownership habits, were
controlled in the statistical models, as fully detailed in the Material and Methods and Supplementary
Table 3. Further questions that were included in the model, regarding the type of behavioral changes
in the dogs are presented in Supplementary Table 4.

Discussion
Humans and dogs are both social animals, and their bond can be traced back at least 15,000
years ago to the Bonn-Oberkassel dog that was found buried with two humans (27). According to the
2019-2020 National Pet Owners Survey conducted by the American Pet Products Association
(APPA), approximately 63.4 million households in the USA owned at least one dog, making them
the most widely owned type of companion animal across the USA at this time. The advantages of
raising a dog have been widely investigated. The human-dog bond potentially has physical,
psychological and mental benefits, and can improve the general well-being and happiness of owners
11

(28-31). Despite all the known advantages, and the evidence that separation of a dog and its owner
has negative impacts not only on the dog but also the wellness of the owner (32), millions of
companion dogs are abandoned every year (33). Dog abandonment carries high costs and a significant
risk for public health (24, 25, 34). Prior to this study, it was unknown whether the COVID-19
pandemic was a risk factor for dog abandonment, as well as a risk for impaired well-being of the dogs
as a reflection for the potential impaired well-being of the owners. Therefore, the motivation to
conduct the current study was to explore the human-dog relationship during this pandemic, to benefit
the welfare and well-being of both humans and animals, in accordance with the One Welfare
approach. The One Welfare approach extents the One Health theme, suggesting that there is a strong
connection between welfare and health of human and animals (35-40). The rationale behind the
current study was the hypotheses that human perceptions and acts regarding dog ownership and
adoption might be influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related social isolation, as well as
the stress and well-being of both species.
Our data indicated that not only is the concern of increased dog abandonment not justified, at
least so far, the opposite has occurred. The more social restrictions there were and the harder it got
during the COVID-19 pandemic, measures of dog adoptions improved significantly (Fig. 2); the
demand for adoptable dogs and to serve as a foster family increased significantly, and accordingly,
the length of stay of dogs at the shelter was significantly shorter. Previous reports after disasters, such
as earthquakes or other situations that require immediate evacuation, were associated with a massive
unintentional dog abandonment (41). However, people may refuse to separate from their pet when
needed due to disasters or extreme situations, as pet owners may find their pets closer or at least as
close as family (30, 42). This may be the reason why, so far, the vast majority of people reluctant to
relinquish their dog during the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, further investigations are required, as the
potential risk for dog relinquishment in the coming months, due to the different social and economic
impacts of this pandemic, cannot be completely excluded. Furthermore, as our climate continues to
change, more disasters including pandemics will likely occur, highlighting the need for more research
into crisis-driven human behavior change, including changes to the human-animal relationship.
While it may be clearer why people kept their companion animals, the motivation to acquire
a new dog through adoption, particularly during the COVID-19 related lockdown, is less intuitive.
As expected, many people stated they decided to adopt a dog since they have been planning to adopt
before the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as the fact that people were at home and more available to
the new challenge. In addition, acknowledgment of the fact that a dog can reduce feelings of stress
and loneliness as well as misleading media publications about increased dog abandonment, played an
important role in their decision. Surprisingly, neither the pressure from children and the desire to keep
children occupied, nor an excuse to leave the house during the lockdown, were reported to play an
12

important role in the owners’ decision to adopt a dog under the circumstances. In the scientific
literature, the characteristics of individuals associated with a higher likelihood to adopt a dog, such
as ethnicity and housing, were described (43, 44); however, the specific timing for adoption has not
been investigated. Nevertheless, a previous study found that owners who just obtained a dog expected
that the new dog ownership would increase their walking activity, happiness, companionship, and
would decrease stress and loneliness (13). This may explain the increase in adoption rate during the
COVID-19 pandemic, as social isolation was forced.
In addition, to determining the adoption and relinquishment rates associated with COVID-19,
we investigated the effect of a stressful pandemic on dog welfare in the pet home environment.
Therefore, the questionnaire for dog owners examined the relationship between their impaired quality
of life during the pandemic and the quality of life of their companion dog. Although there is an explicit
limitation in the current study that the life quality of the dog and the development of new behavior
problems were assessed by the owner's perception and not objectively, the results are nevertheless
valuable; as the perceptions of the owners of their dog’s behavior is likely a more important predictor
of relinquishment than objective measures. Previous research have found that new owners of dogs
often do not report the same behavioral problems as relinquishing owners of the same dog, suggesting
that perception plays an important role (45, 46).
It was found that impaired quality of life of the owners was associated with a decreased life
quality of their dog, as well as increased development of new behavioral problems, as judged by their
owners. Although it has been reported that owners have a poor ability to recognize behavioral
problems (13, 47), the perception of the owners can influence the future of the owner-pet relationship,
as well as the chances they would decide to relinquish it (48). Thus, the perception of the owner that
their dog has behavioral problems may influence their ownership, and by that, also its welfare. As
mentioned, the quality of life of the dog, and more than that, its behavior, were neither diagnosed
objectively, nor by professional observers. Therefore, the background of the dogs and the owners as
risk factors for the low quality of life and new behavioral problems of the dog, cannot be thoroughly
concluded from these models. Still, those variables were controlled in the statistical models, and it
was found that the perception of dog owners regarding their impaired quality of life was significantly
associated with their assessment of the lower quality of their dog’s life and its emerging behavioral
problems. These results are consistent with previous studies, which found that there is an effect of
humans’ stress level and well-being on the stress, well-being, cognitive ability and behavior of their
dogs (14, 15, 17). An alternative hypothesis may be that owners in a crisis situation may have had a
pessimistic outlook regarding things in their life and their surroundings, and the resulting decrease of
the dog’s quality of life was due to the overall negative outlook of the owner rather than any true
reflection of the dog. This information is important for both humans and dogs, since it can provide
13

valuable information for initiatives to improve the welfare and well-being of both the dog owners and
their companion dogs, as suggested by the One Welfare approach. For example, the Israeli Veterinary
Services (a branch of the Ministry of Agriculture), who invests an annual amount of approximately
1.2M $ in encouraging responsible dog ownership and adoptions, already improved new upcoming
initiatives based on the current study, such as digital online adoption days, with education regarding
dog responsible ownership.
In this study, although the overall number of dog owners who reported that they were going
relinquish their dog due to the COVID-19 situation was low, it was significantly associated with a
poorer quality of life index of the owners. Among dog adopters that adopted the dog during the
pandemic, a similar percentage is reported for owners that already relinquished their dog or have been
considering it. Since a lack of time of the owners is one of the main risk factors for dog relinquishment
reported in the literature (20), it was a concern that people who adopted during the COVID-19
lockdown would relinquish their dog after going back to routine life. The second survey to detect the
relinquishment rate of dogs adopted during the pandemic was performed at the end of May 2020,
after opening the lockdown. Therefore, in most cases, it has been more than a month from adoption,
to when people were back to routine life. According to previous research, the highest proportion of
dog relinquishment happens just one month after adoption; in fact, owners report knowing of their
dog’s behavioral problem within 24 hours post-adoption (49). It is important to mention that people
who decided to relinquish their dog might have avoided our survey. Still, the relatively low number
of dogs that were uploaded to Yad4 website on May 2020 may indicate that, so far, there was not a
massive relinquishment after opening the lockdown. Hence, we can carefully suggest that the majority
of the adoptions were sucssessful. One hypothesis can be that owners had more time to spend with
their dog at the beginning, which may have helped to ease rehoming. Nonetheless, this hypothesis
requires further investigation in the long run. Furthermore, an important issue that was not covered
in the current research is related to the differences between individuals who already owned a dog to
those who did not, in regards to their coping with the extreme social and economic challenges during
the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, studies show that both children and adults cope better with stress
when owning a dog (12, 42). Therefore, we hypothesize that owning a dog might even prevent the
development of Post Traumatic Syndrom Disorders (PTSD) due to the pandemic or at least ease the
coping with it, if it occurred. It has been reported that after the SARS outbreak in 2003, which may
be equivalent to the COVID-19 pandemic in many aspects, patients suffered from Post Traumatic
Syndrom Disorders (PTSD) (50). It is known that dogs have a positive effect on the treatment of
PTSD, as well as that dog owners might be more resilient (12, 42, 51). Therefore, this is an important
future direction to the human-pet relationship research.
14

In summary, the COVID-19 pandemic that emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, led
to the utilization of social insolation in many countries, as well as to public uncertainty and severe
health and economic concerns. Our study indicates that the stricter the social isolation became during
the COVID-19 pandemic, the interest in dog adoption and adoption rate increased significantly, while
dog abandonment did not change. Furthermore, there was a clear association between individuals’
quality of life and their perceptions of their dog quality of life and behavior, as well as the probability
of relinquishing it. As humans and dogs are both social animals, these findings suggest potential
benefits of the human-dog relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic, in accordance with the One
Welfare approach implying that there is a bidirectional connection between the welfare and health of
human and non-human animals.

Methods
The study was conducted according to the ethical guidelines of the Hebrew University of
Jerusalem. As detailed below, data analyzed included four main datasets: (1) retrospective data from
the pets adoption website Yad4 (http://Yad4.co.il), which is an online search engine for adoptable
pets in Israel, for the period from January 2016 to May 2020; (2) retrospective data regarding
worldwide Google searches for adoptable dogs were downloaded from Google Trends, for the period
from November 2016 to May 2020; (3) data gathered in a prospective online digital questionnaire
targeting dogs owners in Israel, which was active from March 27th, 2020 to April 30th, 2020, during
the COVID-19 related full lockdown in Israel; and (4) data gathered in an online digital questionnaire
targeted people in Israel who adopted a dog from a shelter during the COVID-19 pandemic, which
was active from May 20th to May 25th, 2020, after the gradual opening of the lockdown.

Collection of data regarding abandoned adoptable dogs, adoptions and adopters from Yad4 website
Information regarding abandoned adoptable dogs, adoptions, and adopter’s data were
recorded by Yad4 open-source online website. In this Israeli website, animal welfare organizations
and municipal veterinarians upload individual information for each abandoned dog, typically as soon
as it enters the shelter, and this information is available to potential adopters who can fill an online
adoption request through the website to be considered and approved by the shelter. Dataset included:
records of the dogs uploaded to the website, date of marking the dog as adopted if indeed adopted,
the number of adoption requests sent through the website, as well as requests to serve as foster
families. Data regarding the online use of Yad4 website were extracted from Google Analytics. The
database of the Yad4 website was analyzed from January 2016 to May 2020, and included: 33,883
15

adoptable dogs, 2,618,190 online visits on the website, 53,923 online adoption requests, and 2,042
fostering applications. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, data were compared in five different periods: from
January 2016 until the outbreak in China; from the initial outbreak in China until the first diagnosed
COVID-19 patient in Israel; during the outbreak in Israel, from the diagnosis of the first patient until
the full lockdown declared by the Israeli government; during the full lockdown for a month; and the
gradual opening on May 2020.

Collection of data regarding worldwide Google searches for adoptable dogs
Data regarding the use of the website and worldwide google searches for adoptable dogs were
extracted by Google Analytics (https://analytics.google.com). Retrospective data (from January 2016
until May 2020) regarding trends of searches online for “adopt a dog”, both in the USA and
worldwide, were downloaded from Google Trends (https://trends.google.com) and used for the
analysis. As detailed below, data were compared in four different periods: before the COVID-19
outbreak in China; from the media reports about the outbreak in China on December 27th, 2020 until
March 13th, 2020 – when the World Health Organization (WHO) announced Europe as the epicenter
of the pandemic; from the WHO announcement until the gradual opening on May (the main lockdown
in many countries worldwide); and (4) during May 2020 (gradual opening in many countries).

Online digital questionnaire for dog owners during the COVID-19 related lockdown in Israel
An online digital questionnaire targeting dog owners in Israel was active during the COVID19 related full lockdown in Israel. The questionnaire was designed by the researchers using Google
Forms, and was distributed by a company who specializes in this purpose (Lead Marketing Ltd.;
https://leadmarketingltd.com), in order to specifically and effectively reach dog owners in Israel. The
online distribution of the questionnaire was based on targeting a pre-defined group of respondents,
with a high level of accuracy, characterized by their interests and online behavior (e.g., users that
shop online for dogs’ food, searching for information on dog care). Various digital platforms were
used (i.e., Google Display Network, Facebook, Instagram, and others), and banners ads led users to
the questionnaire, asking them to voluntarily and anonymously participate in the survey with their
consent to be part of this research.
The questionnaire for dog owners was in Hebrew, and participants were asked to reply to
questions regarding their own well-being, as well as the well-being of their companion dog. It
included questions regarding the background of the dog; source of their dog (e.g., adopted from a
shelter, backyard breeding, official breeders), the age of the dog, reproductive status (sterilized or
intact), the number of years they own the dog, where the dog is kept (e.g., inside an apartment, in a
private house, in a garden, free roam). Background about the owners included age, the geographical
16

area in Israel, type of residential area (e.g., city, countryside), and gender. In addition, owners were
asked questions regarding their well-being under the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic (on
a scale of 1-5); “how stressed are you overall from the COVID-19 pandemic?” (1- not stressed, 5severely stressed); “to what extent are you worried about your health risk from the COVID-19
epidemic?” (1- not worried, 5- extremely worried); “to what extent the current crisis was harmful to
your personal economic income?” (1- not at all, 5- severely harmful); “to what extent was your daily
routine change during this time?” (1- no change, 5- extreme change). In addition, owners were asked
how many times a day they walk the dog during the lockdown, the average length of the walk, whether
the attention they gave the dog changed (increased, was not changed, or decreased), their assessment
of their dog overall quality of life under the lockdown (1- remarkably impaired, 5 - remarkably
improved), if there were new behavioral changes in their dog, and whether or not they are considering
to relinquish their dog. For purpose analyses regarding the link between human well-being to their
answers regarding their dog, an impaired quality of life index was generated, by calculating the
average score of the owners based on the responses regarding their overall stress, health concerns,
and their personal economic damage due to the COVID-19 epidemic and lockdown, as detailed
above. The questionnaire was conducted between March 27th to April 30th, 2020, during the COVID19 related full lockdown in Israel, and was successfully answered by 3138 individuals. Records that
were not full, replied by people who stated they did not own a dog at the time of the questionnaire,
minors (under 18 years old), and individuals who marked the age of the dog and the years they raise
him by irrational number (e.g., 51, 139) were not included. Thus, 2,906 records were included in the
analyses. Characteristics of the participants and their dogs are detailed in Supplementary Fig. 2.

Online digital questionnaire for people in Israel who adopted a dog from a shelter during the
COVID-19 pandemic
An online digital questionnaire targeting mainly people in Israel who adopted a dog from a
shelter during the COVID-19 pandemic, was active from May 20th to May 25th, 2020, after the gradual
opening of the lockdown. The questionnaire was designed by the researchers in Hebrew using Google
Forms, and was distributed by Lead Marketing Ltd., in a similar manner as the first questionnaire, in
order to effectively target individuals of the pre-defined group, such as individuals who visited dog
adoption websites, mainly Yad4, dogs shelters and their Facebook fan pages. Participants were asked
to reply to questions regarding the date of dog adoption, the main reason for the specific timing of
the adoption (Fig. 5), as well as on the short-term success of the rehoming (e.g., keeping the dog,
gave it to another family, returned it to the shelter, or considering not to keep it). The questionnaire
was answered by 508 participants, and 312 of them stated they adopted during the pandemic (JanuaryMay, 2020)
17

Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using commercial statistical software (IBM SPSS
Statistics, version 24.0; STATA, version 15.0). Linear Regression analysis was utilized to evaluate
the effects of the spreading of COVID-19 and lockdown stages on adoption and abandonment
outcomes for pet dogs, using data from the Yad4 adoption website. The general structure of the
estimated regressions was as detailed in equation (1).
(1) 𝑌𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛿𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑏𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑘 + 𝛿𝐿𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑏𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑘 + 𝛿𝐿𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙𝐿𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑜𝑤𝑛 + 𝛿𝑂𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑈𝑝 + 𝛾𝑡 + 𝛽1 ⋅ 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑡 + 𝛽2 ⋅ 𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑡 + 𝜀𝑡
Where 𝑌𝑡 was the outcome of interest in month t, the 𝛿's were dummy variable effects of the stages
of outbreak and lockdown, all compared to the baseline period, before the outbreak of COVID-19 in
China. 𝛿𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑏𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑘 is a dummy variable for the months between the outbreak of COVID-19 in
China and the first confirmed case in Israel; 𝛿𝐿𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑏𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑘 is a dummy variable for the period
between the first local case and the start of the full lockdown; 𝛿𝐿𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙𝐿𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑑𝑜𝑤𝑛 – between the start of
the lockdown and the start of gradual opening in Israel. 𝛾𝑡 are calendar month fixed effects controlling
for seasonality in adoption activities, and 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑡 controls for a linear annual time trend. 𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑡
controls for a change in governmental initiatives with regard to encouragement of responsible
ownership and adoptions between 2018 and 2019, to make sure this does not drive our results. 𝜀𝑡 is a
standard error term. Several outcomes were considered variables: the number of adoption requests
received through the website and the number of dogs marked as adopted, as measures of the level of
interest in conducting an adoption process and the final outcome of successful adoptions; the number
of uploaded dogs, as a measure of recent abandonment cases; the number of users on the website, as
a measure of general interest in adoption.
The major part of the analysis uses Israeli data, as detailed above. However, two outcome
variables were added from Google Trends to compare the results to worldwide trends. Google Trends
were used to construct two additional outcome variables: the number of web-searches, in the US, and
worldwide, of the phrase "adopt a dog" during the same period. The regression analysis for these
outcomes was similar to the main model, but the stages of shutdown were defined as: the outbreak in
China, the declaration of World Health Organization on Europe as the epicenter of the pandemic, and
the gradual opening in May 2020. Because the lockdown policies are not centralized in the US and
worldwide, we did not include a specific separate shutdown time-period.
The dog owners' digital questionnaire was analyzed using a Logistic Regression. The binary
outcome variables that were considered are: the life quality of the dog, as assessed by the owner; the
development of new behavioral problems if recognized and defined by the owners; and whether the
owner was considering abandoning the dog. The general model for estimation was as detailed in
equation 2.
18

(2) 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏(𝑌𝑖 = 1) = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 ⋅ 𝐿𝑖𝑓𝑒𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑖 + 𝛽2 ⋅ 𝐶𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑠𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑖 + 𝛾 ⋅ 𝑍𝑖 + 𝛿 ⋅ 𝑊𝑖 + 𝛼 ⋅ 𝐷𝑖 + 𝜈𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖

Where 𝑌𝑖 is the binary outcome of interest for respondent i. 𝐿𝑖𝑓𝑒𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑖 is a dummy variable
depicting whether the respondent declared that his life changed following the COVID-19 outbreak.
𝐶𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑠𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑖 is an average of three responses addressing three aspects of negative effects of the
outbreak: economy, health concern, and stress (as reported by the responders). 𝑍𝑖 are owner
characteristics: gender, age and whether there are young kids in the household. 𝑊𝑖 are dog
characteristics: age, whether the dog was adopted from a shelter, number of years with the owner. 𝐷𝑖
are characteristics of the care given to the dog: number of walks a day, the average duration of the
walks, and a general measure of attention to the dog. 𝜈𝑖 are geographical area fixed-effects and 𝜀𝑖 is
a standard error term. The Logistic Regressions, as they are based on the responses of the owners,
which can be biased on their own, should be interpreted as descriptive analysis rather than being given
causal interpretation.
Descriptive statistics are given as Mean ± SE, 95% confidence interval, or as frequency (n)
with percentage (%), as applicable. A P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. All reported Pvalues were based on a two-tailed hypothesis.

Supplementary Table 1: Multiple Linear Regressions models for adoption measures
Linear Regression analyses were utilized to evaluate the effects of the spreading of COVID-19 and
lockdown stages on adoption and abandonment outcomes for pet dogs, using data from the Yad4 adoption
website. The table completes the information presented in the manuscript regarding these models. Each
outcome variable is presented in a different section; the number of adoption requests received through
the website, the number of dogs marked as adopted, as measures of the level of interest in conducting an
adoption process, and the final outcome of successful adoptions; the number of uploaded dogs, as a
measure of recent abandonment cases; the length of stay at the shelter, calculated from the difference
between the day uploaded to the website to the day marked as adopted; the available foster families that
did not get a dog; and the daily online visits on the Yad4 adoption website. The predictors were the
different periods in the development of the COVID-19 pandemic, controlled for the year, month, and

by the owner
Analyses of responses to dog owners' questionnaire using logistic regression. The table completes the
information presented in the manuscript regarding these models. Each section represents a different
model of binary outcome: (1) the quality of life of the dog (as assessed by the owner); (2) the
development of new behavioral problems (recognized and defined by the owners); (3) whether the owner
was considering to relinquish the dog. Predictor: impaired quality of life of the owner. Characteristics of
the dog and the owner were controlled in the model: owners’ gender, age, whether there are young kids
in their household (under 18 years old), and geographical region. Dog characteristics: age, whether it was
adopted from a registered shelter, number of years with the owner. Ownership characteristics (as reported
by the owner): number of walks a day, the average duration of the walks, and general estimation of
change in their attention to the dog (1- decreased, 2- no change, 3-increased).
