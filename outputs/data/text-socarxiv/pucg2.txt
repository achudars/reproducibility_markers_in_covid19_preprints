Abstract
The emergent situation brought about by COVID 19 has led to an unprecedented change in the
educational sector worldwide, including the Sultanate of Oman. Most of the educational
institutions here have responded swiftly to fulfill the requirements of academia by switching to an
online emergency remote teaching mode overnight. To get adjusted to the ‘new normal,’ teachers
across all academic disciplines, including the English language, have had to adapt to new teaching
approaches and learn new skills and competencies to confront this challenge. This empirical crosssectional research study explores the teacher technology self-efficacy, the challenges faced, and
the innovative practices adopted by the EFL teachers during the crisis. A mixed-methods approach
was used here, including an online survey and in-depth, semi-structured interviews with six
teachers. The survey was administered to 100 EFL teachers from fourteen higher-education
institutions, whereas the interviews were held with six survey participants. The study found that
majority of the teachers had a strong sense of self-efficacy in using technology as well as
considerably positive learning experiences and novel innovations, which all resulted in the various
ways they faced pandemic-related challenges. The paper gives, in particular, an account of the
innovative techniques adopted by the interviewed teachers during the Pandemic crisis. This
investigation hopefully adds to the field of knowledge by sharing effective, innovative techniques
that have relevance to EFL teaching in Oman and beyond.

Introduction
The first human victim of coronavirus COVID-19 was recorded in Wuhan City, China, in
December 2019 (WHO, 2020). Governments around the world have constantly been working to
control the spread of COVID-19 ever since. WHO and other organizations have provided detailed
guidelines on preventive measures, social distancing protocols, and details of required protective
equipment for safety. The spread of the virus has led to an immense metamorphosis in the socioeducational landscape (Murphy, 2020). A common non-pharmaceutical intervention adopted by
most countries to mitigate the transmission rates in the absence of vaccine was the declaration of
partial or full lockdown (Ferguson et al., 2020; Pei, Kandula & Shaman, 2020). This also led to
the closure of educational institutions in the quasi-totality of countries.
The closures imposed an urgent need for online teaching, which resulted in a multitude of
challenges for teachers, policy-makers, and students (Flores, 2020). Educational institutions
around the world began to deliver their courses online. Students of all ages and levels started
employing technological resources to partake in the online classes. Other organizations also played
their part in the contribution of combating the pandemic. UNESCO developed a forum with
educational applications to assist students during their learning. Massive Open Online Courses
(MOOC) platforms such as Coursera, Udemy, Amazon, and others also provided services and
courses free of charge (Draycott, 2020).
Looking at the situation in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Audah, Capek, and
Patil (2020) estimate that more than 103 million students have been unable to go to school in the
said region since the outbreak of the pandemic. As was seen during previous crises in the region,
being unable to attend school has detrimental impacts on student communities. Accordingly, the
countries of the MENA region have taken prompt measures to handle and contain the
situation. Jordan, for example, dedicated open education channels and an online portal to deliver
lectures on various curricula. The UAE further diversified the services offered through its online
learning institute, iCademy Middle East, established 13 years ago (Euronews 2020). In Saudi
Arabia, most educational institutions developed e-learning programs to aid students in continuing
their learning. Several measures were taken by the Saudi Research and Innovation Network
(Maeen) in collaboration with the Integrated Telecom Company to improve the quality of virtual
classrooms and online resources (Draycott, 2020). The Sultanate of Oman also observed the rapid
shift to online learning modes. Schools and universities at all levels of education employed various
online platforms like Google Classrooms, Schoology, Seesaw, Blackboard, and Moodle to allow
students to continue learning from home. The country’s Ministry of Education and Ministry of
Higher Education prescribed guidelines concerning teaching and assessments to be strictly adhered
to by all the academic institutions across the Sultanate (Osman, 2020).
Rasmitadila et al. (2020) define two modes of online learning: Synchronous and
Asynchronous. In the Synchronous mode, students and teachers are together in a virtual place and
interact via video conferencing applications and chatting tools at the same time. In the
Asynchronous mode, learning happens indirectly; there is no live interaction between the students
and teachers as a group simultaneously; i.e., the teacher provides materials through an online
platform, and students are provided the flexibility to learn at their pace. Institutions in Oman did

not take a single, unified approach. Some opted for the asynchronous mode, some chose to teach
synchronously, and some decided to use both.
The process of switching over to the online mode adopted during the pandemic was quite
hasty, and most of the institutions were in somewhat of a trial and error phase. Typical online
learning has well-established principles and guidelines. Therefore, the term better suited to this
form of instruction is ‘Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT)’ (Hodges, Moore, Lockee, Trust, &
Bond, 2020).
The practices adopted as a result of an emergent situation are certainly not a result of trial
and testing. Therefore, this form of teaching has its own challenges. Several challenges have been
reported by teachers and students alike. They range from inequitable technological resources
(Morgan, 2020), lack of motivation among students, absence of dialogue, and limited teacher
technology self-efficacy. The situation gets even more severe when it comes to EFL teaching,
where transmission of content not only depends not only on words but also on a range of other
features and factors including, body language, facial expressions, context, to name a few
(Granados, 2020).
At the same time, the pandemic has made it essential for teachers specifically to be
‘technologically skilled’ (World Bank 2020). They have been urged to explore technology and
come up with unique innovative practices. The pandemic has resulted in technological
advancement in the field of education (Zhu & Liu, 2020). Blumenstyk (2020) believes that the
pandemic could very well prove to be a ‘black swan’ moment for the educational landscape. It can
prove to be a catalyst for the widespread acceptance of online education, a consideration that has,
in the past, faced much opposition.
However, there is very limited research evidence with respect to EFL teaching and learning
during ERT. A few studies in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the United States have been conducted at
the school level. None of them can be categorized as a comprehensive nationwide, cross-sectional
study that looked at the challenges faced from the teachers’ lenses at the tertiary level. Moreover,
the topic remains unexplored in the context of the Middle Eastern and Arab regions except for
Osman’s (2020) study, which provides a background on the steps adopted by the government and
Ministries of Education in Oman but it is conducted in the context of teacher education at one HEI.
Hence, this cross-sectional, expansive study, conducted on 100 EFL teachers from 14 HEIs
in Oman, explored the Teacher Technology Self-efficacy (TTS), the way EFL teachers managed
the situation brought about by the pandemic, their perceptions on ERT, challenges they faced, and
some of the innovative practices they adopted during this period.
Research Questions
This study aims to answer the following three research questions:
• To what extent are the teacher participants satisfied with their technology self-efficacy in
technology embedded teaching?
• How is ERT managed and perceived by EFL teachers under investigation?

What challenges have EFL teachers faced during the online/remote teaching during the
COVID 19 pandemic, if ever?
What are the innovative practices adopted by the teachers during the COVID 19 pandemic?

Literature Review
Teacher Technology Self-efficacy (TTS)
Teacher self-efficacy is the perception or belief of a teacher in his or her ability to successfully
achieve an educational task (Bandura, 1997). Research has confirmed the significance of a positive
sense of efficacy on teacher effectiveness (Putman, 2012). According to Moersch (1995),
“Individuals with high levels of self-efficacy are most inclined to accept change and choose the
best option” (p. 40).
Teacher Technology Self-efficacy (TTS) is a teacher’s belief in their ability to use
technology in their lessons effectively. Teachers play a crucial role in developing and enhancing
students’ skills; therefore, it becomes vital for teachers to be equipped with 21st-century
technological skills. If teachers lack the confidence to carry out instruction that targets technical
skills, they will not be very likely to use such skills in their classrooms. Moreover, the potential of
the technology can only be exploited in totality if teachers also participate enthusiastically (Naqvi,
Khan & Mahrooqi, 2014). Research has proved that teachers with a high level of TTS are more
likely to adopt innovative teaching approaches (Kao, Chin-Chung, & Shih, 2014; Wang, Hsu,
Campbell, Coster, & Longhurst, 2014). The importance of TTS is aptly summarized in this
statement, “Technology self-efficacy has come to play a crucial role in the preparation and
implementation of educators who can successfully use educational technology to enhance student
learning” (Brown, Holcomb, & Lima, 2010, p.121).
Teaching and Learning during COVID 19 Pandemic
Zhou, Wu, Zhou, & Lee (2020) have defined online learning as a process of ‘content
dissemination’ through the resources available via the Internet, also called e-learning and distance
education. They argue that online education was generally used in tandem with traditional
classroom teaching, to supplement classroom activities. However, due to the critical health risks
posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become essential to convert all education to the online
medium to prevent the gatherings of students. According to public health officials, social
distancing protocols are the most effective measures in preventing an uncontrollable spread of
COVID-19 (Murphy, 2020). To this effect, face-to-face classroom interactions needed to be
limited and the implementation of ‘Emergency E-learning’ was required.
In order to protect students and teaching staff alike, educational institutions were instructed
to suspend all on-campus teaching and shift to teaching students via a mix of online resources. An
emergency policy initiative called “Suspending Classes Without Stopping Learning” was first
launched by the Chinese government to continue teaching and learning activities as schools across
the country were closed to control the spread of the Corona virus (Zhang, Wang, Yang, Wang,
2020). The same policy was later adopted by 156 countries (World Bank, 2020). To continue the
process of teaching and learning, schools around the world employed the use of various online
meeting tools and e-learning platforms. For instance, Jan (2020) has reported that Google

Classroom, Remind, Seesaw, and Zoom were used in Malaysia to shift to ‘technology-based homeschooling.’ Similarly, online resources were used to continue the peer-tutoring system among
medical students at the University of Bristol, UK (Roberts et al., 2020). Zhu and Liu (2020) stated
that Beijing Normal University shifted all of its courses online due to campus closure. Wechat
discussion groups, school website, Zoom, Classin, and TronClass were used. In Georgia, a T.V.
school by the name of Teleskola was launched to aid the learning process. In Oman, Moodle was
popularly used for blended learning, Microsoft Teams was used for synchronous teaching, and
“assistive technologies such as Nvda screen reader, Index Everest v5, Natiq Reader, Braille
display, OCR software for PDF” were used for specially-abled students (Osman, 2020, p.4).
Similar structures for ongoing learning were implemented in approximately 96 countries, with
tools like online libraries, television broadcasts, video lectures, and online channels (Basilaia &
Kvavzade, 2020).
Challenges Faced and Innovative Practices Adopted during ERT
Learning online during the pandemic has impacted students of all regions differently. It has
increased the difficulty in learning for EFL students who are now studying at home. Teachers
complain that teaching English language skills to non-native students is extremely difficult during
the ERT phase since language is acquired through interaction (Atmojo & Nugroho, 2020).
Teachers also state that non-verbal communication, body language, and interaction between
students, which are key elements to effective language learning, are deeply missed during online
classes (Granados, 2020).
Another major challenge faced by teachers from the students’ end is that of inequitable
technological resources. There are many households that do not have consistent internet access.
While discussing the challenges of online education in Indonesia, Fansury, Januarty, and Rahman
(2020), state “Many students live in areas without reliable internet access and/or struggle to get
internet signal…''(p.5). A similar situation is revealed by Goldberg’s (2018) study, which makes
mention of a considerable number of households not having reliable sources to receive online
education in the U.S. In 2017, 14% of U.S. children did not have Internet access at home. The
school district of Philadelphia banned graded virtual instruction since this method could not
guarantee equal access to technology (Mezzacappa & Wolfman-Arent, 2020). Students from lowincome households are also less likely to have their own computers at home (Morgan, 2020). Such
inadequate facilities make it extremely difficult for teachers to conduct engaging and interesting
online sessions (Atmojo & Nugroho, 2020). However, the situation appears to be much better in
Oman, considering the 2020 statistics. According to a survey conducted by the Ministry of
Technology and Communications and the National Center for Statistics and Information,
smartphone ownership in Oman is 95 percent and residential access to the Internet is 94 percent
("Omani residential internet access and smartphone ownership dip by 1% from 2019", 2020). It is
important to note at this point that the survey did not delve deep into the strength and the speed of
data connection being used by these households. The high-speed connections are relatively
expensive in Oman. The institutional networks are usually strong, but a majority of students cannot
afford to have a strong Internet connection, due to which continued online sessions with both audio
and video features were not possible from their end. The reason for connectivity issues is not just

limited to the low data package being used but also the terrain since some students and teachers
reside in hilly areas, which affects the network connectivity negatively.
Other challenges include learners’ procrastination, the insufficient orientation of learners
with the online mode, and lack of time for teachers to fully develop the course material (Nkonge
& Gueldenzoph, 2006). Students who struggle with low English literacy also face added difficulty
understanding the teachers’ instruction online and may even skip the written instructions if they
cannot understand them (Atmojo & Nugroho, 2020). The study conducted on EFL learners by Allo
(2020) also reported the difficulties faced by them in understanding instructions during ERT. The
learners requested the lecturers to send voice notes via WhatsApp whenever they upload
assignments on the Learning Management System.
Students also tend to be absent during the hours scheduled for the online session, and they
have the misconception that online education is akin to a vacation, so they tend not to take it
seriously. In addition to this, online teaching can convert students into passive listeners due to a
lack of participation in online classes. This reduces their capability to apply their learning outside
the classroom (Quevillon, 2020).
According to Gerlich (2005), teachers have, in the past, found online teaching to be more
demanding than traditional teaching methods. Teachers have also complained that online teaching
is considerably more laborious due to the amount of time spent in grading, feedback process, and
responding to queries (Wegmann & McCauley, 2008; Atmojo & Nugroho, 2020).
Despite the challenges it entails, the ERT has, paradoxically, offered great learning
experiences for teachers. The pandemic created an opportunity that made it essential for teachers
to be ‘technologically skilled’ and not just see technology self-efficacy as an additional skill
(World Bank, 2020). Technology is an integral aspect of this new normal, and to a certain extent,
it is true that the pandemic could fuel a new wave of innovation in teaching and learning. A variety
of applications and programs have been utilized during this time to continue education and homebased learning, like Artificial Intelligence, the Internet, cloud-based platform, online meeting
platforms, and E-learning systems. To counter the challenge of providing feedback on student
work, Google Classroom private comments feature and WhatsApp personal chat were used by
teachers (Atmojo & Nugroho, 2020). All this combined has produced accelerated growth in the
system of online education (Zhu & Liu, 2020).
The review of existing literature reveals that there are very limited studies that have
investigated the EFL teaching situation in the higher education sector during the pandemic with a
specific focus on the technology self-efficacy of EFL teachers, the challenges faced, and the
innovative practices used. Therefore, this study aims to fill this gap in the literature and share the
innovative practices adopted by teachers to overcome the hurdles.
Methodology
A mixed-methods approach was considered as the best option to seek a holistic picture of the
ERT in Oman with respect to the EFL teachers’ technology self-efficacy, their perceptions on

ERT, the challenges faced by them, their readiness to confront the challenges, and the efforts made
by them to handle the situation. Both quantitative, as well as qualitative data, were collected to
answer the research questions as Shorten and Smith (2017) rightly state, “Purposeful data
integration enables researchers to seek a more panoramic view of their research landscape, viewing
phenomena from different viewpoints and through diverse research lenses”(p. 74).
Context
This study was conducted with fourteen higher education institutions (HEIs) in Oman. The
Sultanate of Oman, commonly known as Oman, is a Middle Eastern Arab nation that lies on the
southeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula. The medium of instruction in government schools,
where education is imparted for free, is Arabic (Al-Farsi, 2007), while the tertiary level courses
are offered in English medium. Though there are numerous private and international schools in
the Sultanate where the medium of instruction is English, most of the local student population
receives an education in government schools. Therefore, a large percentage of students entering
higher education institutions need foundation English courses to cope with the requirements of
tertiary level courses. Al-Mahrooqi and Denman (2018) state that “the transition from Arabicmedium government schools to English-medium tertiary institutions has been reported as posing
a number of significant difficulties for Omani learners” (p. 3).
In response to the situation brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and the distancing
protocols suggested by WHO, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher Education
Oman announced a complete lockdown of all educational institutions in the country on 15th March
2020. The ministries provided guidelines to educational institutions with respect to teaching,
learning, and assessment (Osman, 2020). The teacher participants of this study belong to Omani
HEIs, which include public and private colleges and universities. They either teach the foundation
level courses or credit-bearing undergraduate level English for Special Purposes courses.
Instruments
Quantitative data were collected using an online survey questionnaire, and qualitative data were
collected using semi-structured in-depth interviews.
Survey Questionnaire
An online questionnaire carrying five sections which included, demographic details, teacher
technology self-efficacy, teaching, and learning during COVID 19 pandemic, challenges faced,
and best practices adopted during ERT, was used. The questionnaire was administered using the
online survey platform called Survey Monkey.
The purposive sampling method was used to decide the survey participant sample. A total
of 100 English language teachers, 49% males and 51% females, from 14 Higher Education
Institutions from Oman responded to the survey. The teachers belonged to the age group between
25 to 45 years and above. Their educational qualifications ranged from Bachelors to Ph.D. holders.
The academic positions held by the teacher participants ranged from Assistant Lecturer to
Associate Professor Level. However, they are referred to as teachers for the sake of consistency.
With respect to the level of students taught, 51% of them taught at the Foundation program level
while the rest taught the undergraduate level programs or at both levels. The survey participants

belonged to 27 different nationalities, some of whom were Omani nationals and the others are
foreign nationals who belong to the expatriate population residing in Oman.
Semi-structured Interviews
Qualitative narrative data were collected through semi-structured interviews with six teachers
from fourteen different higher education institutions. The purpose of these interviews was to gain
deeper insights into the teachers’ experiences during ERT, the challenges they faced, and the
innovative practices adopted by them to cope with the situation. Diversity in terms of age, teaching
experience, academic position, qualification, and the type of institution was considered while
selecting interview participants. Thematic analysis of interview data was conducted to answer the
research questions.

Findings
Teacher Technology Self efficacy (TTS)
The section on teacher technology self-efficacy carried eight items. A five-point Likert
agreement scale was used to assess the TTS of the survey participants. The section aimed at finding
out the extent to which the survey respondents were satisfied with their technology self – efficacy
in technology embedded teaching. As evident from the weighted averages shown in Table 2, most
of the teachers showed a high level of TTS with a weighted average of 4 and above on most of the
items. Most of them either strongly agreed or agreed that they could use technology confidently in
teaching language skills; use correct terminology while directing students in computer use; provide
online feedback to students; use Microsoft programs with ease; respond to student needs with
respect to technology, and adopt creative ways to use technology. Two items received a slightly
lower than four weighted average, which included the provision of online feedback (3.93) and
designing and grading technology embedded assessments (3.86). Designing and grading
assessments have also been reported as the most challenging aspect of online teaching as a
response to the question on the same topic in the section on challenges faced during ERT.

ERT during COVID-19
As evident from Figure 1 below, most (71.28%) of the teachers reported that their institution
adopted online teaching, 18.09% informed that their students had both options-online and remote
teaching, and 9.57% relied entirely on remote teaching where students learned at their pace using
materials on institutional Virtual Learning Platforms (VLEs). Regarding the use of online
platforms for teaching and learning, Microsoft Teams (59.7%) appeared to be the most popular
program used by HEIs, followed by Google Meet (18.09%), Zoom (9.57%), and others (12.77%),
as shown in Figure two below.

Overall, the attendance in the online EFL classes appears to be good, if not very high, in
all the HEIs. As shown in Figure 3, 38.30% of teachers had 50-75% attendance, and 37.23% had
75-100% attendance in their classes. This can be related to the effectiveness of teachers in handling
technology and their high level of TTS. However, some (19.15%) teachers had relatively lower
attendance, and a few teachers (5.32%) appear to have very low (less than 24%) attendance in their
classes. The reasons for low attendance are detailed in the interview analysis section.

The most popular mode of assessment among the HEIs was assignments, which the students
were expected to complete within a stipulated time frame. More than half the respondents
(55.32%) reported using assignments as the mode of assessment, followed by online closed-book
tests (22.34%) and online open book tests (13.83%). There were other modes of assessment used
by 8.51% of respondents, which included project-based assessments, in-class participation, timed
80-minute assignments, attendance, etc.
Teacher Perceptions on the New Mode of Teaching during ERT
It is interesting to note that almost a similar percentage of respondents found the shift to online

neither found it easy nor difficult. Only 3.19% found it very difficult. This reflects that the task of
switching over was not very intimidating for approximately three fourth of the teacher participants,
which can once again be connected with the high level of TTS shown by teachers. However,
41.49% sometimes, 32.98 often, and 18.09% always missed the traditional classroom experience.

Challenges Faced
Though the teachers did not find the task of moving to online teaching very difficult, they did
face challenges in teaching and assessing students. The most challenging aspect of online teaching
appeared to be the assessment design (40.43%), followed by teaching (29.79%), providing
feedback(11.70%), grading(10.64%). Other challenges (7.45%) mentioned by teachers included
technological hazards and timely submission of assignments by students. The other challenges
stated in the option ‘others’, where teachers were asked to specify the challenge, included timely
submission of assignments and handling of technicological hazards faced by students.

A number of challenges came to the front through the last open-ended question of the survey
and teacher interviews, which are listed below. Several challenges that teachers reported were
common:
• Difficulty in giving feedback on student writing since many points need to be discussed;
students couldn’t understand the comments and did not apply the feedback
• Difficult to urge the students to work on the feedback
• Internet connectivity issues (especially in rural areas) and lack of necessary hardware
• Online teaching is missing the emotional element of teaching
• Lack of face to face and peer/group interaction
• Lack of motivation
• The infrastructure was meant for online meetings only, not for teaching.
• Provision of interactive class and peer/ group experience
• The students are not prepared in advance. It was a sudden move.
• Academic integrity violation
• Teaching blank screens and not being sure if students were actually listening
• Students were not very responsible, and they missed classes
• Students’ response to assignments was slow, late submissions, and students who were
not attending classes would find it very hard to comprehend how to do the assignments
• Feedback on students’ writing compositions
• Issues with invigilating online classes, students found novel ways to cheat.
• Older, less technology-oriented teachers faced a lot more issues.
Innovative Practices
A number of innovative practices were highlighted by the set of teachers interviewed. Some
are being summarised here.

Teacher A used OBS Studio for screen recording of the laptop with voice over in the form
of short lectures for flipped learning related to various genres of essays and grammar items.
According to him,
This enabled learners to refer back, download, and watch the lessons at their own pace.
This practice also made it easier for the teacher to hold the students accountable if they
deliberately ignored an important aspect of the class or complained that a particular point
was not covered.
Teacher B used Google Docs ‘Read and Write’ extension to give feedback on writing
exercises.
There is an in-built in feature in Google Docs which allows you to give a voice note, which
is very useful and then there is a feature in Chrome extension called ‘Read and Write’
which can be used to give longer comments.
Another feature used by Teacher B was live worksheets. “I used live worksheets which can
be filled online, marked automatically, and scores can be recorded.”
Teacher C invited an expert as a guest speaker in his online session on IELTS, which motivated
students and helped them learn a number of aspects related to IELTS testing.
Teacher D was really excited to share his innovative practice, which was based on
integrating audio clips in the Moodle-based Listening exam.
I was successful in embedding audio to the Moodle-based exam, which helped my team in
designing Listening exams. Otherwise, we had to play audio separately during the listening
exam. It would not have happened if this emergency situation had not risen.
Teacher D also mentioned integrating e-rubrics for writing assessments on Moodle, which
helped teachers in marking assignments and auto-generating the feedback to be given to students.
Teacher E informed about several online resources and websites which he used during
ERT, which included Wordwall, Flipgrid, dreamreader.net, lingro.com, youglish.com, and esllab.com. Flipgrid can be used to develop Listening and Speaking skills. Students log in with their
institutional ID. Teachers can check their submissions, grade and give feedback after which the
students receive it through email. One can create a new grid, with topics. Students can record
themselves speaking, with audio and video, or even just audio. It can also be used for assessment
purposes. Students can choose a topic or can be assigned one by the teacher. This motivates
students to speak.
Teacher F used the institutional e-learning platform for uploading assignment briefs,
assignment submissions, and providing feedback. She also shared a number of quizzing apps such
as Kahoot, Padlet, and Edmodo.
In addition to the specific innovative practices mentioned by the teacher participants, some
common online platforms, websites, and gaming applications became popular during ERT. For
online classes, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and GoToMeeting were used, while Microsoft
Kaizala was used by a number of teachers to connect asynchronously.

Discussion of Findings
All the survey participants articulated a strong level of TTS with the weighted average ranging
between 3.86 and 4.38 on a five-point Likert scale. Approximately three-fourths (72.34%) of the
respondents did not find it difficult to switch over to the new mode of teaching, and 56.38%
enjoyed teaching during ERT. The readiness shown by the survey participants in switching over
to the online mode is quite contrastive to the findings of other studies, which reported a lack of
preparedness among teachers to switch to the online mode (Atmojo & Nugroho, 2020). Hence, it
can be safely assumed that there is a strong correlation between TTS and adopting online teaching
practices with ease since most of the teachers appear to have a strong technology self-efficacy.
The teachers with low TTS usually find it difficult to adopt technology embedded teaching, and
the ones with high levels of self-efficacy are most likely to accept change (Moersch, 1995).
It emerged clearly that a large (71%) percentage of Omani HEIs adopted online,
synchronous mode, and also kept the option of asynchronous mode open for students, which
reflects the readiness of these HEIs and their robust infrastructure (Osman, 2020). A similar
approach to continue learning was employed in approximately 96 countries through a range of
online platforms (Basilaia & Kvavzade, 2020). Microsoft Teams and Google Meet appeared to be
the most popular program for synchronous learning in Oman while Google Classroom, Seesaw,
and Zoom were popularly used in Malaysian classrooms (Jan, 2020), and Beijing Normal
University used WeChat discussion groups, Zoom, Classin, and TronClass (Zhu & Liu, 2020)
Despite the high level of preparedness shown by the HEIs in terms of infrastructure, only
37.23% of teachers reported having 75% and above attendance in their classes. This might be due
to other factors such as a lack of student motivation and Internet connectivity issues. Lack of
student motivation has been reported by other studies as well, where the teachers struggled to
engage low motivated students in online classes (Atmojo & Nugroho, 2020).
Regarding the assessments, most (55.32%) of the HEIs used assignments that were to be
completed within a specified duration as the primary mode of assessment. However, the most
challenging aspect of the ERT during the pandemic appeared to be the assessment design. The
institutions had to revise their assessment strategies and plans according to the nature of the courses
during the pandemic. With the revised guidelines on assessment design, teachers found it
challenging to design strategies that accommodate the demands of the ERT.
The most challenging skill to teach and assess was Writing. The same was reiterated by
the interview participants as they found the process of giving feedback very taxing in the online
classes. According to a survey respondent, “Students were not able to understand written feedback
(due to limited English language skills), couldn’t explain all details effectively over email
(feedback can be given more effectively face-to-face).” However, the teachers did come up with
various innovative practices to deal with this, as was reported by Teacher B, who used voice notes
to give feedback via Google Chrome Read and Write extension. A similar suggestion on using
voice notes is provided by Allo (2020) in his study on online learning for EFL learners during
COVID 19.

Another interview participant briefed upon the tedious process of integrating writing
rubrics into the Moodle and the follow-up feedback mechanism. Conducting online closed book
Listening tests was also reported to be taxing since all the students were expected to be online at
the same time with their cameras on, and this lead to an immense load on the institutional Virtual
Learning Environment, which slowed the Internet speed.
Lack of emotional element was reported as another challenge, which is similar to the
finding of Atmojo and Nugroho’s (2020) study on Indonesian teachers who stated that it was hard
to develop emotional bonding with students due to lack of interaction. Motivated interaction
between the teacher and student is the key to EFL teaching. However, most of the study
participants also reported the lack of interaction to be the main hindrance during ERT, as this
slowed the acquisition of knowledge and skills. Students did not respond to them and, if forced,
typed answers in chat windows. Similar concerns were raised by Sun and Chen (2016) and
Quevillon (2020).
The situation brought about by the COVID-19 posed a number of challenges for higher
education institutions and teachers. However, every challenge is an opportunity. The challenges
forced the institutions and teachers to act, find solutions, create, and innovate. Most of the HEIs in
Oman showed resilience in responding to the situation in the best way. The pandemic served “as
an effective ‘change agent’ for promoting rapid adoption of e-learning in such classically changeresisting institutions” (Osman, 2020, p.8).
Conclusion
This study attempted to unveil the perceptions and attitudes of 100 English language teachers
from 14 HEIs of Oman concerning their TTS beliefs, the way they managed and perceived ERT
during the COVID-19 pandemic, the challenges faced by them during ERT, and the measures
adopted to overcome the challenges. The findings revealed that the survey participants showed a
high level of TTS, which is further confirmed by how they managed the situation brought about
by COVID-19 and adopted a range of innovative practices to overcome the challenges faced during
ERT. The main challenges faced included inequitable technological resources, Internet
connectivity issues, lack of interaction, lack of motivation among students, and the absence of
physical presence. In terms of the difficulties faced in teaching, assessing, and providing feedback,
Writing appeared to be the most difficult English language skill for EFL teachers. Despite the
challenges faced by them, most of the teacher participants appeared to be happy with the new
practices they adopted and satisfied with the way they handled the situation. Hence, it can safely
be argued that the situation, to a certain extent, ignited sparks of creativity among teachers.
However, it is essential to note that most of the study participants showed high levels of TTS, and
this might be the reason for their positivity with respect to flexibility in adopting novel technology
embedded approaches.
Limitations, Pedagogical Implications, and Direction for Future Research
A significant limitation of the study is that it does not cover the issues faced during ERT from
the student’s perspectives. In addition to that, all the innovative practices reported by teachers as
part of the delivery were not observed and documented, except the ones adopted at the authors’

institution. Despite these limitations, the study has a number of merits. The study is expansive in
nature as the data were collected from 14 HEIs from across the Sultanate of Oman, and the
population sample comprised of participants with diverse characteristics. Moreover, it gives a
comprehensive picture of the ERT across the world and provides insights into EFL teaching,
learning, and assessment during the ERT. Innovative practices shared by teacher participants;
approaches adopted for synchronous and asynchronous teaching, assessment, and feedback; and
the adjustments made to the teaching pedagogies reported by teachers under investigation are the
major contributions of this study. The innovative practices shared by the participants can be used
by EFL teachers globally.
However, to get a 360-degree view of the entire spectrum, student perspectives on ERT
also need to be explored. Besides this, it will be worthwhile to carry out an in-depth study on selfefficacy with respect to technology. Additionally, the correlation between TTS and variables such
as age and gender needs to be explored, and accordingly, training programs can be designed to
strengthen teachers’ skills. Future teacher training must include the integration of technology in
language learning. It is also advisable to carry out extensive research focusing on the switch over
from traditional to online teaching (Moorhourse, 2020).
