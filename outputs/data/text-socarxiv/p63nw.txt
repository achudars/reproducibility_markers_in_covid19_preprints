Executive summary
Key points
•

Predictions about the impact to Australian Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) in 2020 suggest a range approximately 5 per cent to 25 per
cent lower than in late 2019. There is a broad consensus that GDP
growth in 2021 will deliver a total level of output approximately 4 per
cent to 5 per cent lower than in late 2019.

•

There are 956,000 households living in Housing Affordability Stress
(HAS) in Australia. Commonwealth Rent Assistance (CRA) reduces
this number to 758,000. There is a heavy concentration in the private
rental sector (69%) but this is reduced to 61 per cent after CRA is
taken into account.

•

Nearly 50,000 households that face high housing cost burdens
themselves also own a private investment property – this is cause
for concern given that private renters have been disproportionately
affected by the downturn.

•

It is estimated that the number of households living with HAS would
have risen to 1,336,000 (from the 758,000 baseline) without the
JobKeeper and JobSeeker interventions.

•

The JobKeeper and JobSeeker interventions reduced the incidence
of housing affordability stress by a considerable amount: 861,500
household compared to 1,336,000 without the intervention.

•

As JobKeeper moves through its later phases, HAS gradually rises by
a further 124,000 compared to phase one, and 73 per cent of these
households are private renters.

Executive summary

•

A combination of CRA and a 25 per cent rent relief scenario have
the most powerful impacts on simulated numbers in HAS of all
the interventions modelled.

•

The 2021 scenario modelling shows that CRA is not sufficient to
fully mitigate the impacts of an economic downturn in any of the
scenarios examined.

•

Finally, households living with HAS and owning an investment property
themselves are predicted to more than double. All interventions
modelled have a mild effect on these additional numbers.

Executive summary

Key findings
In this project we reviewed and synthesised the small, niche literature on the economic consequences of
pandemics. We found that predicted impacts on GDP ranged from 1 per cent to 7 per cent. However, these
predictions were based on milder pandemic scenarios, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)
or influenza. Predictions about the impact of COVID-19 on Australia’s GDP range from a 5 per cent drop to a
25 per cent drop. However, most other studies suggest a strong recovery after the initial lockdown phase(s),
including possible second or third waves, resulting in a 2021 position that may be somewhere between 4 per
cent and 5 per cent lower than 2019 GDP in real terms.
Early predictions included employment loss of up to 25 per cent. Fortunately, it is clear that the impact of
COVID-19 has been somewhat mitigated, aided by Australian Government interventions. However, the job losses
and potential future job losses that COVID-19 has caused are concentrated in public-facing industries including
arts, leisure, accommodation and food services. This has the potential to dispropoprtionately impact specific
groups of individuals and households.
In the course of this research, we established a baseline set of estimates of unemployment and numbers
of households affected by living in Housing Affordability Stress (HAS). We then applied economic scenarios,
modelled propensities to become unemployed, and simulated the impacts of policy interventions. The latter was
centred on the Australian Government’s JobKeeper and JobSeeker measures, and the Coronavirus supplement.
We found that large-scale job losses—which were mirrored by the total number of people (3.5 million) on income
support measures (such as JobSeeker, JobKeeper and Coronavirus supplement)—would have resulted in
1,336,000 households living in HAS without the Australian Government interventions. This estimate reflects
eligibility for Commonwealth Rent Assistance (CRA), but it is important to note that there remains a heavy
concentration of households living in HAS in the private rental sector (58%).
We also found that nearly 124,000 households who face high housing cost burdens themselves also own a private
investment (compared to the baseline estimate of 49,000 pre-pandemic).
The JobKeeper and JobSeeker interventions reduced the incidence of housing affordability stress by a considerable
amount: 861,500 households compared to 1,336,000 without the intervention.
As JobKeeper moves through its later phases, HAS gradually rises by a further 62,000-124,000 and more than
70 per cent of these households are private renters. The 2021 scenario modelling shows that CRA is not sufficient
to fully mitigate the impacts of an economic downturn in any of the scenarios examined. Households in HAS rise
from the baseline 757,000 to at least 797,000 to 893,000.

Policy development options
The economic shocks imposed by the SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) pandemic are unprecedented, and the full impacts
and knock-on consequences are difficult to predict. This report focuses on the potential impacts to households
and their ability to meet their housing costs in the face of economic uncertainty, reduced incomes and potential
widespread job losses.
As the JobKeeper and JobSeeker interventions are gradually wound back, there are some important, but currently
unanswered, questions. Yet these can be informed by the findings set out in this report. For example:
•

To what extent is the phasing of income supports well-timed in terms of Australia’s economic recovery?

•

What is the right balance between withdrawing supports as the economy recovers, and withdrawing supports
to pressure individuals back into the labour market?

•

Is the design of the current interventions appropriate in terms of targeting the right individuals and
households, i.e. those facing the most precarious of labour market and housing system circumstances?

•

Should the current interventions be phased out completely after March 2021, or is there a case for continued
support after this?

Executive summary

The study
This study was commissioned as one of AHURI’s COVID-19 research program, and responds to the urgent
housing research and policy questions that arose as a consequence of the pandemic. The overall aim of the
project was to undertake a rapid redevelopment of economic and housing system modelling approaches
previously funded by AHURI in order to provide deep policy insights to a range of COVID-19 interventions.
Through three inter-linked research questions we examined the impacts of the pandemic on:
1.

labour market participation, employment and earnings

2. the distributional impacts of the fallout on owners, renters, investors and at risk households
3. specific policy interventions.
The project provides a range of policy relevant outputs, including:
•

scenario-based estimates of economic impacts on a range of sectors of the economy

•

estimates of impacts on probabilities of labour force participation and (un)employment

•

distributional analysis demonstrating impacts on owners, renters and ‘Mum and Dad’ investors

•

specific analysis of three high risk groups of households (stressed households; households ‘on the edge’;
and households with double precarity)

•

demonstration of the policy impacts of Commonwealth Rent Assistance (CRA); JobSeeker and Jobkeeper;
and a crisis-related temporary rent relief scenario for two states.

1. Study context and methods
1.1 Policy context
At the outset of this project the full extent of the economic impacts of COVID-19 were unknown, but the subject
of considerable speculation, both internationally and in Australia. In addition to domestic responses and events,
outcomes depend on many rapidly changing factors, including impacts of the global economy and public health
responses internationally. The purpose of this chapter is to set out a range of possible economic scenarios
for Australia, focusing on 2020 and 2021. It will set the scene for understanding the possible impacts on (un)
employment, household incomes, and the number of households potentially unable to afford to meet their
housing costs. This chapter does not undertake any formal economic forecasts, but summarises findings from
a survey of the literature, and a review of recently published economic scenarios for the Australian economy.
Australia recorded its 100th case of COVID-19 on 10 March 2020. The following day, the World Health Organisation
declared the SARS-CoV2 virus, and the associated COVID-19 disease, a global pandemic. Yet, the impacts to
Australia’s economy were being felt well before these critical dates.
A particularly early study was published by McKibbin and Fernano (2020). The February publication date reflects
the early stages of the outbreak when it was by no means certain that the virus would spread globally. Indeed, the
principal scenarios considered by McKibbin and Fernano relate to the Chinese economy and impacts on global
demand, rather than outbreaks in other countries. Nevertheless, the seven scenarios considered envisaged a
drop in Australian GDP of between 0.3 per cent and 7.9 per cent. The most severe scenario assumed a 30 per
cent attack rate and 3 per cent mortality rate. However, the modelling did not explicitly consider the impacts
of long periods of lockdown or shutdown.
By March, Thorpe et al (2020) had published their economic scenarios in which they outlined three key concerns:
1.

whether the virus would spread more widely than to Italy, Iran, Japan and South Korea

2. the longevity of the virus
3. the pace at which industries could return to normal after virus containment.
Thorpe et al (2020) assumed a 50 per cent attack rate, followed by a permanent reduction of 1 per cent of the
workforce. As events have played out, these assumptions have been overly pessimistic in terms of the attack
and mortality rates, but have not reflected the lockdown and shutdown effect strongly enough. Nevertheless,
these PWC scenarios suggested a reduction in Australian GDP of $34.2 billion and a fall in 2020-21 tax revenue
of $25.8 billion. They assumed a 1 per cent rise in government expenditure, with the combined measures amount
to a $30.1 billion swing to a $24.8 billion budget deficit.
More recently, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) (2020) has reported that 2020 global growth is projected
to be -4.9 per cent, with growth of 5.4 per cent in 2021 such that global GDP will ‘just exceed its 2019 level’. The
corresponding figures for ‘other advanced economics’ (which includes Australia) are -4.8 per cent and 4.2 per
cent. Economic forecasts by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) (2020) are
for a 7.6 per cent drop in global economic output in 2020, followed by a 2.8 per cent recovery in 2021. These
most recent forecasts reflect the assumption of a second hit to economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2020.

1. Study context and methods 

The most significant immediate impacts of the pandemic have clearly been on unemployment. Unlike ‘typical’
economic recessions, the job losses experienced early in the economic shut-down (February / March 2020) were
not in the banking, financial and business service sectors, but in labour intensive customer facing sectors such as
retail, hospitality, food services, arts and recreation, and education (Wilkins, 2020; Hérault et al, 2020). However,
falling incomes for many households, and growing labour market uncertainty will have knock-on consequences
for consumption. Falling business confidence impacts upon investment, and thence consumption.
D’Souza (2020) and the Wilkins (2020) noted that the initial impacts of the COVID-19 shutdown impacted
disproportionately on younger people, and on females. The highest initial job losses were experienced in
accommodation and food services; arts and recreation services; rental, hiring and real estate services; and
professional, scientific and technical services.
As the coronavirus began to spread rapidly, from its origins in Wuhan, China, it quickly became clear that its highly
infectious nature and high proportion of cases potentially requiring hospitalisation and/or admission to intensive
care units meant that the health services of even the most advanced countries would quickly become swamped
and unable to cope with demand. The concept of lockdown had been deployed effectively in Chinese cities,
and was implemented in Italy – one of the worst affected countries early in the evolution of the pandemic – on
9 March 2020. There has been some international variation in nations’ approaches to suppress, contain or
attempt to eradicate the coronavirus, but most have implemented lockdowns of one severity or another. The
enormous international scale and near coincident timing has encouraged some commentators to dub the second
quarter of 2020 as ‘the great shutdown’. Australia can be seen as one of the more proactive nations in the world,
having urgently implemented a number of government funded policy interventions early in the crisis. In particular,
the JobKeeper payment was developed and introduced in mid-to-late March 2020. The Treasury (2020) reports
that it had three principal functions:
•

supporting business and job survival

•

preserving employment relationships

•

providing income support.

The Treasury (2020) also reported that approximately 3.5 million individuals received the payment during April
through May, and that over 920,000 organisations were involved.
The overarching objective of this study was to estimate the number of households likely to fall into difficulties
meeting housing costs as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, and to then assess the separate and combined impacts
of these policy interventions. In addition, the project examined Commonwealth Rent Assistance (CRA), and the
potential impact of a simple rent relief scheme.

1.2 Research methods
1.2.1 Introduction
The short COVID-19 program research project was inspired by the fact that early debate about policy
interventions focussed heavily on economic stimulus measures including Jobkeeper and JobSeeker. Such was
the urgency to support incomes and protect jobs in the early phase of the pandemic that the possible housing
system interventions required, and those most likely to be effective and for which groups, had not been thought
through or analytically tested.
This project therefore explicitly linked possible economic outcomes on employment and unemployment by
sector, on earnings and incomes, and then on the housing outcomes of specific groups of interest. These groups
included home owners, private renters, and small investor landlords. It included a specific focus on three types of
household: those suffering financial stress, those living on the edge (being close to losing their homes), and those
living in double precarity (facing job insecurity and unaffordable housing).

1.2.2 Research approach
At the outset of the project, economic and housing policy options and development of new options were heavily
frustrated by the extreme uncertainty associated with any assessment of the economic outlook for 2020 or 2021.
As demonstrated earlier in this chapter, the range of scenarios or forecasts for the Australian and the global
economies published during the pandemic is very wide. Indeed, the volatility of these forecasts has also been in
flux as countries, and regions of countries, have appeared to embark on economic recovery, some in earnest and
others only to experience a second or third wave of COVID-19 outbreak. It is therefore important to acknowledge
that there is no realistic or credible methodology by which to forecast Australian or global economic output or
recovery to any useful degree of accuracy. Instead, our methodology develops and examines a range of possible
economic scenarios that may apply in late 2020 and through 2021. We then examine the consequences on
households and their ability to meet housing costs under these different scenarios. We assess the effects of a
range of policy interventions and their effectiveness in mitigating the possible rise in households experiencing
HAS under the various scenarios.
The project methodology essentially has three distinct, but integrated and overlapping strands. Each was
desk-based, and involved repurposing and fine-tuning tried and tested datasets and analytical approaches.
This approach had the advantage of reducing risks considerably, and of leveraging substantially from previously
funded AHURI research activities. It also made it possible to arrive at a well-informed view on the range of
economic and policy scenarios possible through 2020 and 2021 within a very tight project timetable.
Strand one: Impacts of COVID-19 on labour market participation, employment and earnings
At the outset of the project, the likely economic impacts of COVID-19 remained largely unknown, and extremely
difficult to predict. Economic outcomes depend on many rapidly changing factors, including impacts on the global
economy, and public health responses internationally. Yet, it was already clear that the most significant immediate
impacts were to be felt in the labour markets. Unlike ‘typical’ economic recessions, job losses in the early stages
of the pandemic were not in the banking, financial and business service sectors, but in labour intensive customer
facing sectors such as retail, hospitality, food services, arts and recreation, and education. Recent work by the
Grattan Institute (Coates et al. 2020) suggested that the unemployment rate could rise to between 10 per cent
and 15 per cent, with heavy concentrations in the sectors listed above. They also warned of a second round of
economic impacts driven by falling levels of household and company consumption. However, since then, it has
become clear that some countries have entered a partial recovery, and others are experiencing slower rates of
recovery and/or subsequent waves of COVID-19 outbreak.
Aggregate econometric models are generally reliable at predicting outcome variables when past relationships are
assumed to hold. However, great caution must be had when using such approaches to predict outcomes in response
to an unprecedented shock, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. For this reason, we combined results from several
sources including re-estimation of labour market equations reported by Rowley, Leishman et al. (2017) AHURI
housing need model using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey. This had
the additional benefit of bringing earlier work up to date (to wave 18 or 2018, while previously estimated to wave 15
or 2015). These equations were used to predict individuals’ labour market participation and employment decisions.
In this strand, we extended the time period covered by the model and refined the equations such that they provide
deeper insights for each employment sector. This allowed the generation of more highly tailored predictions of
unemployment probabilities and impacts on earnings for each economic sector.
The second approach used a combination of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) input-output tables
and statistics on job losses, and a survey of published economic forecasts, to map out a range of possible
consequences of contraction in the worse affected sectors (such as food, retail, tourism, hospitality, education)
on all other economic sectors.

1. Study context and methods 

By combining the economic scenarios with the re-estimated econometric output, it was possible to recalculate
the probability of each individual (aged 16-65) in HILDA becoming unemployed under a range of assumed
economic and labour market conditions. The approach effectively used individuals observed in 2018 (the most
recent wave of HILDA) as a snapshot, representing conditions before the pandemic. After running each scenario,
individuals’ incomes and their household’s total income were recalculated under the new assumptions. This
permitted the re-estimation of the number of households in housing affordability stress, as explained under
strand 2 below.
Strand two: Impacts of COVID-19 on housing outcomes (distributional analysis)
Strand two attempts to drill down into a household-level analysis to assess the distributional impacts that the
pandemic could have on housing outcomes, comparing the three key actor groups in housing markets – renters,
home owners and landlords. We draw directly on the unemployment and earnings findings from strand one to
predict the labour market and income positions of these key groups under the COVID-19 crisis. In line with
strand one, we use the 2018 HILDA Survey for the distributional analysis.
Early housing policy interventions during the pandemic were, rightly, focussed on renters, who are more likely
to be on lower incomes and employed in industries directly affected by the COVID-19 shutdown. For instance,
bans on evictions and rent relief schemes were among the major planks of housing policy that the Australian
Government announced in March and April. However, previous AHURI research by Ong et al. (2019) has shown
that home owners are increasingly carrying large mortgage burdens into later stages of life. As such, a significant
group of precarious owners exist, and the analysis therefore aims to uncover the extent to which their foothold
on owner-occupation could become more precarious as a result of the pandemic.
The analysis also attempts to provide some indication about the extent to which indebted ‘Mum and Dad’
landlords could be impacted. Australian Tax Office (ATO) data shows that more than 1 million (around 60%) of
rental investors are negatively geared. Given these investors are making rental losses, they are likely to be more
financially exposed to any changes in personal economic circumstance as they are making up shortfalls in rental
revenue from other income sources such as their wage. They are also less well-placed to offer rent reductions
to tenants with potential negative impacts on tenants’ outcomes.
The analyses are conducted along the following lines:
•

between-group analysis of the extent to which the repercussions of the pandemic differs between renters,
versus home owners and landlords

•

within-group analysis that sheds light on the particular characteristics of households within each of the three
actor groups that are particularly exposed to the repercussions from the pandemic.

We estimated the impact that job losses will have on households’ capacity to meet housing costs, focusing on the
size of these three key ‘at risk’ groups:
•

‘Stressed’ households: We estimated the possible increase in the number and share of households that are
plunged into housing stress as incomes falls. We used typical 30 per cent housing cost burden benchmarks
(the ‘30/40 rule’) to identify groups in housing stress.

•

Households ‘on the edge’: The likely increase in the number and share of renters and mortgagors who would
be at the edge of being evicted from their home if rent relief and eviction moratoriums were not in place. These
are identified as households in severe housing stress e.g. paying more than half their income in housing costs
and leaving insufficient amounts to meet non-housing needs (the ‘50/40 rule’). We also estimated the number
and share of landlords who are at risk of withdrawing from the rental property market due to an inability to
sustain negatively geared properties, with potentially negative ramifications for tenants.

•

Households facing ‘double precarity: This assessment highlighted the double precarity of job insecurity and
unaffordable housing that some households face. Groups that face this form of double precarity are arguably
more vulnerable to the COVID-19 crisis than those who are facing job insecurity but live in affordable housing,
as well as those who face housing stress but have secure jobs. We shed light on the extent to which labour
market repercussions are likely to have disproportionate impacts on those already facing double precarity.

Strand three: Impacts of policy interventions in response to COVID-19 (policy simulations)
There are three key sets of policy interventions that are likely to assist tenants with responding to the
repercussions of COVID-19. Using technology from models previously funded by AHURI (AHURI housing need
model and AHURI-3M), we simulated the impacts of these three key sets of programs on the housing cost
burdens of individuals affected by the crisis as identified in strand two. The impacts are simulated both separately,
and as composite / cumulative effects.
•

Existing housing assistance programs – CRA and public housing: This presents a base case scenario
of existing settings. We took the sample of individuals affected by the crisis as identified in stage two and
simulated the extent to which these housing assistance programs provided a buffer against housing stress for
these individuals through their income loss. The simulation essentially addressed the following question: If no
policy interventions were offered to provide temporary assistance to vulnerable renters to sustain tenancies
through the COVID-19 crisis, to what extent would current programs in the form of CRA and public housing
shield tenants from housing stress? It also offered insights into the potential ramifications of removing
temporary measures, such as rent relief and evictions moratoriums, before tenants are able to regain the
economic footing they had prior to the crisis.

•

Labour market programs – JobKeeper and JobSeeker: We simulated the impact of these two labour market
programs on the incomes of renters and mortgagors, and thus assessed the extent to which these payments
protect capacity to meet housing costs by sustaining incomes.

•

Crisis-related temporary rent relief (varies by state): We simulated the rent relief programs announced by
states and territories and assessed the extent to which they shielded tenants from falling into housing stress.
In practice, we carried out a very simple simulation loosely based on the measures examined in Victoria and
the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), by assuming a reduction of 25 per cent in rent payable by households
containing one or more individuals eligible for JobKeeper or JobSeeker.

2. Consequences of the
pandemic on incomes
•

Previous hypothetical studies of the macro-economic impacts of a
possible pandemic estimated a drop in GDP of between 1 per cent
and 7 per cent, based on SARS or Flu scenarios.

•

Predictions about the impact to Australian GDP in 2020 range from
around -5 per cent to -25 per cent.

•

There are numerous predictions about the COVID-19 impacts on
Australian GDP beyond 2020, but there is a broad consensus that
GDP growth in 2021 will result in output that is approximately 4 per
cent to 5 per cent lower than in late 2019.

•

Some predictions of loss of employment by commentators are as
high as 25 per cent. Early studies, that occurred in the first stages
of the pandemic, suggest these job losses will be concentrated in
public facing industry sectors, such as arts and accommodation
and food services.

•

Earlier research and commentary during the pandemic has
highlighted that younger workers, females, and private renters are
likely to be disproportionately affected.

•

We developed a range of scenarios that mirror the 3.5 million people
reported to be on JobKeeper payments at the outset of the project,
and three scenarios concerning job losses in 2021, beyond the
current income support interventions.

2.1 Previous research on pandemic impacts
Prior to the onset of COVID-19 a niche literature existed, focussed on the potential economic consequences
of a pandemic. For example, Kennedy et al. (2006) employed the Australian Treasury Macro-Econometric Model
(TRYM) to examine the possible impacts of an outbreak of influenza on the economy. This study simulated a drop
in exports from Australia of approximately 9 per cent per annum, a drop of more than 6 per cent in household
consumption in the first year, and a decline of 7.4 per cent in business investment. Keogh-Brown et al. (2010)
simulated a range of scenarios for the United Kingdom’s (UK) economy and concluded that the worst affected
sectors would cause a decrease in GDP in the range of 0.22 per cent to 4.45 per cent. Smith et al. (2009) used
a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model and demonstrated a range of 0.5 per cent to 4.3 per cent
reduction in UK GDP as a result of an influenza pandemic. Keogh-Brown et al. (2009) examined the potential
impact of a SARS pandemic on four European Union (EU) countries (UK, France, Belgium and the Netherlands)
and concluded a likely downturn range of 0.5 per cent to 2 per cent.
Previous studies have taken influenza or SARS as the presumed pandemic event, and the range of GDP impacts
is around 1 per cent through 7 percent. There is no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic has already produced
much more severe economic impacts globally. There have been a number of recent commentaries and forecasts,
but the range of predicted impacts is very wide. For example, Thorpe et al. (2020) forecast that GDP in Australia
will reduce by $34.2 billion while Romano (2020) predicts $220 billion. McKibbin and Fernando (2020) predict
a GDP contraction of up to 7.9 per cent in Australia. In the case of the United States (US), del Rio-Chanona et
al. (2020) argue that GDP will be cut by 22 per cent. Global GDP is tipped to decrease by 1.25 per cent to 1.5
per cent in the OECD’s forecast (Boone et al. 2020) or by 2 per cent to 4 per cent in the World Bank’s forecast
(Maliszewska, Mattoo et al. 2020). The IMF projects that the global GDP will shrink by 4.9 per cent in 2020 (IMF,
2020). In the case of Australia, GDP is projected to contract by 6.7 per cent this year.
Many of the immediate economic impacts affect global trade and employment. Global trade activities are
predicted to fall by 2.3 per cent to 3.75 per cent (Boone et al. 2020). Additionally, Maliszewska, Mattoo et al.
(2020) indicate that exports will reduce by 2.5 per cent to 4 per cent. For consumption, McKibbin and Fernando
(2020) estimate that the consumption in their selected countries will decrease by 0.24 per cent to 0.5 per cent.
Del Rio-Chanona et al. (2020) forecast that 24 per cent of jobs are at risk and wages will fall by 17 per cent in the
US. McKibbin and Fernando (2020) estimate that labour supply will reduce by 0.1 per cent to 4.6 per cent, and in
Australia, 14 per cent to 26 per cent of workers (or 1.9-3.4 million people) will be unemployed (Coates et al. 2020).
Coates et al. (2020) and Grodach and Martin (2020) show that job losses in Australia are larger in the service
industries (i.e. food, education, entertainment and tourism) than the manufacturing and mining industries.
As noted in chapter one, several recent studies have estimated the impacts of COVID-19 shutdowns on
employment and GDP. The Grattan Institute (Coates et al. 2020) focussed on jobs, as noted above. Thorpe et al
(2020) presented a range of scenarios that suggest a decline in GDP of around 2.5 per cent in 2020, but did not
consider 2021. IMF (2020) project a decline of 4.9 per cent in 2020 and growth of 5.4 per cent in 2021 (implying
0.24% growth compared to 2019). OECD (2020) envisage a drop of 7.6 per cent, followed by growth of 2.8 per
cent, or a quarter four 2021 outcome of -4.2 per cent compared to 2019. Thus, the overall economic outlook for
2021 appears to range from a worst (published so far) case scenario of -4.2 per cent through to a best case of
0.24 per cent, as compared with 2019. The OECD (2020) economic outlook predicts a reduction of employment
of approximately 3 per cent in 2020 and 3.6 per cent in 2021 (compared to 2019), as shown in figure one.

As figure two shows, the OECD predictions for change in household net disposable income are less dramatic
than the impacts on employment. Of course, this reflects the very significant public expenditure on income
support measures, particularly JobSeeker and JobKeeper. The impacts are summarised in figure two. This also
sets out the OECD forecasts for growth in exports and imports (right-hand Y axis). A drop of 9.5 per cent in
private final consumption in 2020 is partially offset by a 5.7 per cent increase in government final expenditure.
The position stabilises in 2021, with a 1.1 per cent increase in private final consumption and a 3.9 per cent increase
in government final expenditure.

2.2 Impacts on employment
In this section, we begin by summarising a set of employment scenarios for 2020 and 2021, and move on to
explain how these are used to simulate impacts on the employment probabilities of individuals. It is important to
note that there are two broad time periods that are of interest. First, and reflecting that there were approximately
3.5 million people on JobKeeper in July 2020, we calculated a probability for each employed individual in HILDA
in 2018 to have switched from being employed, to being unemployed. Second, we investigated what is likely to
happen to those individuals’ probabilities of switching from employed to unemployed status in 2021, after the
winding back and withdrawal of these income support measures.
To design the scenarios, we began by examining ABS (2020) data on job losses by broad industry sector. The
February and May quarters of 2020 were compared with the corresponding quarters in 2019, as illustrated in
figure three.

reading,
ABSthe industry sector labels are shortened to one to two words in figure three. The analysis
clearly shows the disproportionate impact of lockdown measures on several industry groups, including ‘Arts’ (arts
and recreation services) at -15.4 per cent, ‘Accommodation’ (accommodation and food services) at -29.3 per cent,
and ‘Administration’ (administration and support services) at -15.7 per cent. Some sectors show an increase in
employment, including financial and insurance services, agriculture and electricity, gas, water and waste services.
However, whether this reflects a one-off change in behaviour during or because of lockdown, or a ‘real’ effect,
remains to be seen.
The pattern of job losses by industry group revealed by the ABS data differs in some areas to the analysis put
forward by other sources early in the pandemic. For example, D’Souza (2020) reported that younger people and
women were proportionately harder hit (see also Wilkins, 2020; Hérault et al, 2020). The D’Souza (2020) analysis
of the hardest hit sectors early in the lockdown period is replicated as closely as possible in our first economic
scenario, labelled ‘pre-JobKeeper’. The differences between these assessments and the ABS results are
summarised in figure four.

The ‘early lockdown’
Source: ABS scenario is more pessimistic than ABS statistics, particularly for the agriculture, utilities
and financial industry groups. The scenario suggests a small reduction in jobs in each of these sectors, rather
than the small to moderate increases shown by ABS. The ‘early lockdown’ figures capture the notion that small
positive effects in these sectors may have been an aberration caused by behavioural factors such as panic
buying, or purchase of home office equipment and furniture, that featured early in the lockdown. However, the
‘early lockdown’ scenario is much more optimistic in its treatment of ‘Administration’ and ‘Health and Social Care’.
These sectors were not reported to be badly affected in the early stages of the pandemic, but are revealed in
more recent ABS data as being heavily impacted. Whether this reflects true loss of jobs, or a distortion caused
or enhanced by the Jobkeeper and JobSeeker interventions is also impossible to determine at this stage.
However, the difference in scenarios is large enough to justify the wisdom of including the ‘early lockdown’
scenario. As we explain later in the report, this pattern of job losses is used as one scenario to reflect possible
outcomes in 2021 – after the end of the JobKeeper and related income support measures. Henceforth, we refer
to it as the ‘pre-JobKeeper pattern’ to emphasise that it is used to consider the early 2020 pattern of observed
job losses, but applied to 2021.
We introduce two additional scenarios to represent possible outcomes in 2021. These are derived from ABS
statistics, but we focus on the May 2020 quarter and assume that the observed job losses in 2021 will be either half
or 1.5 times of those in the quarter two 2020 scale. We label these simple scenarios ‘mild’ and ‘severe’. In summary,
we arrive at three scenarios that are primarily of interest in predicting what may occur in 2021 (not in 2020):
•

job losses by industry group mirror the early lockdown period

•

job losses are half the ABS observed rate in quarter two of 2020

•

they are 1.5 times the ABS observed rate in quarter two of 2020

2.3 Modelling individuals’ employment
In this section we briefly set out our methodology for the development of an econometric model that accounts
for the propensity of individuals to be employed. As discussed in chapter one, this model is then used to simulate
the way in which the economic scenarios alter those individuals’ probabilities. In effect, the model is used to
predict which employed individuals become unemployed under different economic conditions. The process
used, outlined below, replicates that set out in an earlier funded study (Rowley et al. 2017).
Since Heckman (1979), it has been commonplace in econometric analysis to correct for sample selection bias
when estimating labour supply models through a two step procedure. Sample selection bias occurs naturally
in labour supply modelling. This is because the probability of being employed (if in the labour force) and of being
a labour force participant are interrelated. Potential bias arises from the exclusion of non-participating individuals
from the sample when estimating the probability of being employed versus unemployed. Failure to take into
account selection can result in econometric estimates of coefficients that are biased and inconsistent (i.e. the
size and statistical significance of individual estimated coefficients may lead to false conclusions and poor policy
prescription or advice). Hence, we modelled participation and employment status as a two step sample selection
process. This modelling was based on the original work of Heckman (1979) and followed the sample selection
correction approach of Verbeek and Nijman (1966) (see also Vella (1998); Vella and Verbeek (1999)).

2. Consequences of the pandemic on incomes 

The two step model assumes that the propensity to participate in the labour force (versus not in the labour force:
Participation) and the likelihood of being unemployed (versus employed: Employment) can be modelled by limited
dependent variable binary response Random Effects Models (REM) with sample selection. Specifically, equations
one and two (below) control for selection bias and include time-invariant individual effects to control for unobserved
heterogeneity in panel data. They incorporate dynamics (lagged variables) to control for state dependence (Greene
2007), and control for endogeneity that could result from recall problems or respondent perceptions in reporting
both current and previous behaviour. This is done by creating a polynomial of predicted values of the dependent
variable (the participation equation) and including this in the labour force outcome equation (Semykina and
Wooldridge 2011). In addition, the Mundlak specification of the REM, which allows for potential correlation between
the individual specific effects and explanatory variables, was used (Chamberlain 1980; Mundlak 1978). The Mundlak
correction, including in the right-hand side of the estimated equation(s) the individual or group (over time) means
for time-varying explanatory variables that vary sufficiently within groups, ensures REM results are equivalently
as robust as the Fixed Effects Model (FEM) (i.e. consistent, efficient and unbiased). Moreover, as is well known,
the benefit of the REM is that time-invariant explanatory variables (e.g. county of birth) are not differenced out
of the model as they are in the FEM model. There is also the added benefit that REM estimators are more able

estimated with Stata/SE 16.1 (2020). We included an extensive set of individual and demographic variables and
the same set of explanatory variables (i.e. the X vector) are included in both models. This allowed the estimation
process to indicate the most relevant explanatory variables for this dataset (i.e. we favour a general specification).
This resulted in a subset of variables that are statistically significant and of the same sign in both models (e.g.
education); variables that are significant in both, but with opposite sign (e.g. general health for females) and
variables significant in one equation but not the other (e.g. children under four years of age). Interestingly, the
only included explanatory variable (or category of a group variable) that is not significant in either male or female
equations is the macro-economic level (log of the) average wage rate. Results of the two models, for males and
females separately, are presented in appendices one and two.

Predicted unemployment numbers
The modelling approach leads us to predict a baseline total unemployment of some 758,000 in 2018, representing
the ‘pre-COVID-19’ baseline position. The model is calibrated by adding a weight that reduces each individual’s
probability of being employed in line with the assumed job losses in table two. However, the first scenario
we modelled is not shown in table two, but represents an approximation to the distribution of individuals
on JobKeeper in June 2020, as reported by the Treasury (2020). This resulted in a predicted 4,115,00 total
unemployed, representing the originally observed 783,000 plus an additional 3,332,000 (which is close to the
3.5 million reported by The Treasury (2020) to be eligible for JobKeeper). We examine the impacts of progressive
withdrawal of JobKeer in chapter four. The next chapter examines the incidence of housing affordability stress,
and its distribution, in the baseline predictions. This provided a useful set of comparisons when we examined
the impacts of 2020 and 2021 economic scenarios in the subsequent chapter.

•

There were 956,000 households living in Housing Affordability
Stress (HAS) in Australia in 2018 (the baseline for the study).

•

Eligibility for Commonwealth Rent Assistance (CRA) reduces this
number to 758,000.

•

There is a heavy concentration of households living in HAS in the
private rental sector (69%), but this is reduced to 61 per cent after
CRA is taken into account.

•

Nearly 50,000 households who face high housing cost burdens
themselves also own a private investment property. This is cause
for concern given that private renters have been dispropoprtionately
affected by the downturn.

•

We estimate that households living with HAS would have risen to
1,336,000 (from the 758,000 baseline) without the JobKeeper and
JobSeeker interventions.

3. Consequences of unemployment on housing precarity 

3.1 Analytical approach
In this chapter, we provide a set of baseline results based on analysis of HILDA respondents for 2018. This is the
latest available wave of the HILDA survey, and we use it to represent the pre-COVID-19 scenario or baseline. We
focussed on identifying households living with levels of income and housing costs such that they were defined
to be in Housing Affordability Stress (HAS) according to the well-known 30/40 rule, which has become a standard
indicator in Australia over the course of many years. Households with a gross disposable income that sits within
the lower 40% of the distribution, and whom pay 30% or more of their income by way of housing costs are defined
as being in HAS under this measure. Households paying 50% or more are defined as being in Severe Housing
Affordability Stress (SHAS).
In Australia, many renters in the private and not-for-profit (NFP) sectors are eligible to receive a Commonwealth
Rent Assistance (CRA) payment. We calculated the eligibility of each household in HAS and SHAS and then
recalculated the number of households in HAS and SHAS after this payment is received. We treated the CRA
payment as a subsidy to housing costs rather than a supplement to income (i.e. we deducted CRA from housing
costs rather than add it to income).

3.2 Baseline estimates of those in housing affordability stress
In this section we approximate the results to the nearest 500 households to reflect that the numbers are estimates,
or are based on simulation results, and we wish to avoid the impression of false precision. The analysis is based on
2018 data, and provides a baseline that can be used as a comparator in the later analysis of economic scenarios.
The analysis indicated that there were some 9,634,500 households in Australia, of which 956,000 were living in HAS
before the application of CRA. CRA is only available to private and community housing tenants whose rents exceed
minimum thresholds applicable to their household type. The effect of CRA is to reduce the number to 758,000.
Nearly 69 per cent of households in HAS are private renters before CRA, compared to just under 61 per cent after
CRA is received. These patterns are depicted in figure five.

The number of households living in SHAS is much lower before CRA at 346,000, compared to 270,500 after
the receipt of CRA. The incidence of SHAS in the private rental sector is even higher than for HAS at 73 per cent,
compared to 65 per cent after the application of CRA. CRA has a disproportionate positive impact on household
renting privately, as designed. However, it is also clear that the provision of public housing has a considerable
impact on alleviating housing affordability stress. Only 8 per cent of households in the tenure are in HAS (nearly
all of them are in SHAS). However, CRA is not targeted at mortgaged home owners, and therefore has no impact
on the HAS or SHAS numbers.

The analysis also examined the cross-over between households living in HAS, and ownership of private rental
investments. This is a potentially important group of households given that the immediate impact of the COVID-19
shutdown measures were felt disproportionately by private renters, and by households in the lower part of the
income distribution. There is considerable potential for highly leveraged households owning an investment property,
who are spending a higher proportion of their incomes on their own housing costs, to run into trouble meeting those
costs and/or the servicing of their investment loan commitments. We examine this in more detail in the next chapter.
We estimate that there are around 37,500 mortgage home owners living in HAS who also own an investment
property, and approximately 12,000 private renters in a similar position. This is summarised in figure seven.

Descriptive statistics suggest that, for those in HAS, the distribution by age is fairly uniform except that the
50-64 age group is disproportionately represented (27% of cases). More than 46 per cent has a low educational
attainment (year 12 or below). Single adults account for 42 per cent and a further 22 per cent is single parents, and
69 per cent is private renters. The distribution of HAS within Australia is relatively uniform apart from New South
Wales (32% of households but 39% of HAS cases) and Victoria (26% of households but 19% of HAS cases).
The descriptive statistics for all households (whether in HAS or not) show that the 50-64 age group also represents
27 per cent of cases, but almost 30 per cent has a low educational attainment, 24 per cent is single adults, 14 per
cent is single parents and 43 per cent is private renters.
The highest incidence of households living in HAS, but owning an investment property themselves, is in Western
Australia (9.1%) followed by New South Wales (6.2%), and then Queensland (5.0%).

3.3 Impact of the phase one JobKeeper and JobSeeker
The Treasury (2020) reported that in June 2020 there were approximately 3.5 million individuals eligible for the
JobKeeper income support interventions. Their data suggests job losses by industry grouping on the scale
summarised in figure nine. On the assumption that this many people, and the distribution shown in figure nine,
simply lost their jobs then the impact on households’ incomes would have been considerable. We recalculated
households’ incomes on this assumption, and recomputed the HAS measures accordingly.
The analysis provides an insight into the number of households potentially unable to meet their housing costs
without the JobKeeper and JobSeeker intervention (see figure 10). We estimate that households living with HAS
would have risen to 1,336,000 (from the 757,000 baseline) and that those in SHAS would have risen to 721,000
(from the 270,000 baseline). These figures reflect eligibility for CRA (i.e. are after CRA is applied to housing costs).

3.4 Next steps
JobKeeper, JobSeeker and the coronavirus supplement were designed as short-term, emergency measures to
support household incomes, businesses and the continuation of jobs during recovery from the economic shock
caused by the pandemic. As we explain in the next chapter, the interventions are scheduled for gradual reduction
and withdrawal starting in the third quarter of 2020 and concluding after March 2021. The over-arching issue to
be addressed in this research project concerns the likely impacts on individuals, and their households, of lost
employment and income, and the knock-on consequences for their ability to meet their own housing costs.
This chapter has set the scene for the economic scenario and policy modelling analyses in the next chapter. It
is important to establish that Australia already had a significant number of households living with HAS and SHAS
prior to the pandemic. Our results confirm earlier studies that have shown a concentration of HAS in the private
rental sector (Rowley and Ong 2012; Wood and Ong 2017). The provision of social housing is very effective in
reducing the burden of housing costs, but the sector is very small by international standards. Home owners with
a mortgage are not immune either. We estimated that there are 221,000 households in the bottom 40 per cent
of the income distribution who are paying more than 30 per cent of their income towards mortgage costs.
The analysis has also shown that without the JobKeeper, JobSeeker and coronavirus supplement interventions,
the implications of large scale job losses on households’ ability to meet housing costs would have been devasting.
We estimate that households in housing affordability stress would have nearly doubled, from 757,000 at the
baseline to more than 1.36 million, even after CRA had been taken into account. Having set these broad baselines
for comparison, we now move on to summarise the more detailed modelling of economic scenarios and policy
intervention simulations in chapter four.

4. Impacts of policy
•

We carried out simulations for 2021 and predict possible total
unemployment ranging from 783,500 to 1,752,000.

•

The JobKeeper and JobSeeker interventions reduced the incidence
of housing affordability stress by a considerable amount: 861,000
households compared to 1.34 million without the intervention.

•

As JobKeeper moves through its later phases, the predicted number
of households in HAS is expected to gradually rise by a further
124,000; 73 per cent of these households are private renters.

•

A combination of CRA and a 25 per cent rent relief scenario have
the most powerful impacts on simulated numbers in HAS of all the
interventions modelled.

•

The 2021 scenario modelling shows that CRA is not sufficient to
fully mitigate the impacts of an economic downturn in any of the
scenarios examined.

•

Finally, households living with HAS and owning an investment
property themselves are predicted to more than double, and all
interventions modelled have a mild effect on these additional
numbers.

4.1 COVID-19 policy intervention parameters
We modelled three key sets of policy interventions implemented to assist Australians in response to the
repercussions of COVID-19. The first two sets constituted labour market programs that assisted Australians to
meet their housing and non-housing needs by providing some income support throughout the economic crisis.
The third constituted rent relief schemes that helped alleviate housing stress via direct rent reductions to tenants
in need.

4.1.1 JobKeeper
The JobKeeper payment was a wage subsidy program introduced by the Australian Government to help
businesses affected by COVID-19 meet the costs of their employees’ wages. This, in turn, ensured that more
employees could retain their job and continue to earn an income despite the sharp economic downturn
(Australian Government 2020a).
JobKeeper eligibility relied on the characteristics of both the employee and the business for which the employee
worked. Employees working in government agencies (including the education sector) and casual workers who had
been employed by their current employer for less than 12 months were two key groups excluded from JobKeeper
eligibility. Furthermore, to be eligible for the payment, an employee must work for a business that meets a
turnover test based on the business’ aggregated annual turnover ($1 billion or less) and an expected percentage
decline in turnover of 30 per cent or more due to COVID-19 (Australian Government 2020a). These parameters are
modelled, with the exception of the turnover test. This test cannot be modelled as actual turnover and expected
changes in turnover cannot be observed in the HILDA Survey. Hence, the JobKeeper estimates in our modelling
exercise reflect upper bound estimates.
We modelled all three JobKeeper phases announced by the Australian Government since its introduction in
March 2020. The parameters of each phase are set out in table three. The initial phase ran from March 2020
until September 2020, and was the most generous phase, offering each eligible employee a flat payment rate
of $1,500 per fortnight. During phase two, the maximum payment rate for employees falls to $1,200 per fortnight
for employees working more than 20 hours per week, and $750 per fortnight for employees working less than
20 hours per week. The third phase sees the JobKeeper payment rates drop even further to $1,000 and $650 per
fortnight respectively.

4.1.2 JobSeeker and Coronavirus supplement
Workers who fall into unemployment become eligible for the JobSeeker payment. The JobSeeker income support
scheme was expanded via the Coronavirus Supplement, which significantly increased the maximum amount of
income support payment that an unemployed person can receive (Australian Government 2020b).
We modelled both JobSeeker phases announced by the Australian Government since its introduction in March
2020. The parameters of each phase are set out in table four. In each phase, there is an income free area beyond
which the JobSeeker payment is reduced at a taper rate. The key difference between phase one and phase one
is that the latter is designed to increase incentives to return to work. In phase two, the income free area almost
triples from $106 per fortnight to $300 per fortnight, thereby increasing the amount of income that can be earned
before the JobSeeker payment is reduced. However, the taper rate is higher in phase two, and the Coronavirus
Supplement is reduced from $550 to $250 per fortnight. Because most income support recipients’ entitlements
are determined by their income levels, we do not model the assets test.
It is important to note that there are interactions between the JobKeeper and JobSeeker programs. The
JobKeeper payments received by an individual offset their assessable income when determining JobSeeker
entitlements. Hence, while it is possible for some individuals to receive both payments, JobSeeker entitlements
are reduced when a person is already eligible for the JobKeeper payment (Services Australia 2020).

4.1.3 Rent relief
While the JobKeeper and JobSeeker schemes are federally funded, state and territory governments have
each introduced their own crisis-related temporary rent relief schemes. For instance, the Victorian Government
established a rental assistance fund to provide a one-off rent relief grant of up to $3,000 to Victorians suffering
rental stress due to the pandemic (Department of Health and Human Services 2020). In the ACT, landlords who
reduced rent for their tenants by at least 25% due to the pandemic may be eligible to receive a land tax credit
(ACT Revenue Office 2020).
As it is impossible to directly observe which tenants are likely to receive rent relief from their landlords from the
HILDA Survey, we modelled a hypothetical scenario whereby all private rental tenants received a 25 per cent rent
reduction. While hypothetical, this scenario allowed us to gauge the impact that rent relief schemes are likely to
have on housing stress levels during periods of economic crises.

4.1.4 Commonwealth Rent Assistance
The COVID-19 policy interventions described above can interact with existing housing assistance programs.
Low-income private rental tenants whose rents exceed a minimum rent threshold applicable to their household
type currently receive Commonwealth Rent Assistance (CRA). CRA is paid as: a supplement to a pension; an
allowance to eligible households with no children; or a supplement to the Family Tax Benefit Part A (FTB(A)) to
eligible households with children who receive more than the base rate of FTB(A) (Centrelink 2018). Private renters
who lose employment and become eligible for the JobSeeker payment as a result of COVID-19 will gain eligibility
for CRA. On the other hand, tenants who benefit from rent relief (as outlined in the previous sub-section) may find
their CRA entitlements reduced as their rents fall.
The HILDA Survey contains a comprehensive set of information on respondents’ labour market characteristics.
HILDA also includes data on income support payments (including pension, allowance and FTB(A) payments),
which act as passports to CRA for those respondents’ whose rents exceed the minimum rent threshold applicable
to their household type. However, the HILDA Survey does not report CRA entitlements separately. Using the
relevant data available in the HILDA Survey, we were able to estimate the amount of CRA each eligible private
renter household was entitled to receive. Given we are drawing on the 2018 HILDA Survey, we modelled the
September 2018 parameters of the CRA program.

4.2 COVID-19 policy simulation modelling under alternative economic
scenarios
Micro-simulation modelling is employed to estimate the JobKeeper, JobSeeker, rent relief and CRA entitlements
of Australians under each of the four COVID-19 economic scenarios described previously. It is important to note
that the scenarios cover different time periods. For example, the ‘Treasury’ scenario is intended to cover March
2020 to September 2020, and reflect the eligibility phases coming into play in September 2020 to December
2020, then January 2021 to March 2021, and then beyond March 2021. The other three scenarios are designed
to cover the 2021 calendar year (rather than March 2020 through March 2021).
•

Phase one combines the initial JobKeeper and JobSeeker phases that ran from March to September 2020.
It represents the phase in which financial support from the Australian Government was most generous;
JobKeeper fortnightly payments were $1,500 and the Coronavirus Supplement attached to the JobSeeker
scheme was $550 per fortnight.

•

Phase two combines the second phases of both the JobKeeper and JobSeeker programs that run over the
final quarter of 2020. It is less generous than phase one, with the JobKeeper rates declining and the JobSeeker
taper rates rising.

•

Phase three runs from through the first quarter of 2021. As per table five, the JobKeeper parameters for this
phase have been announced, with fortnightly payments of $1,000 for those working more than 20 hours
per week, and $650 for those working less than 20 hours per week. However, no further changes have been
announced to the JobSeeker program beyond phase two, due to conclude at the end of 2020. Hence, we
assume that phase two of the JobSeeker program will continue into 2021.

•

Phase four is purely hypothetical, as the Australian Government has not announced their plans for the
JobKeeper and JobSeeker programs beyond the first quarter of 2021. Hence, we assume that in phase four,
the JobKeeper program will be fully phased out, reducing fortnightly rates to zero. Those previously eligible
for the JobKeeper program would thus begin claiming JobSeeker payments. Here again, we assume that
phase two of the JobSeeker program will continue through 2021.

4.2.1 The ‘pre-JobKeeper pattern’, ‘mild’ and ‘severe’ scenarios for 2021
As explained previously, we constructed three economic scenarios for 2021. One is based on observations made
by Council for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) early in the 2020 lockdown – we refer to this as the ‘preJobKeeper pattern’. This is an important scenario because it reflects the initial pattern of job losses observed early
in the pandemic, before the introduction of income support measures. There is an argument that some recipients
of JobKeeper would not have lost their jobs in the absence of JobKeeper. Although it is impossible to evidence or
quantify unintended consequences of intervention such as JobKeeper, it is nevertheless important to address
the question to the extent possible. We therefore posit that the 2021 scale and distribution of job losses could
reflect observations early in the pandemic in 2020. To this scenario we added our own hypothetical projections
under the assumption of a mild (versus severe) crisis in 2021. Hence, we modelled the potential impacts of policy
interventions in 2021 under these three economic scenarios. As these scenarios pertain to 2021, we only modelled
phases three and four.

The simulations suggest total unemployment in 2021 ranging from 1,008,000 (mild scenario) to 1,752,000 (severe
scenario). The ‘pre-JobKeeper pattern’ scenario assumes that the pattern of unemployment by industry grouping
would be similar to the patterns witnessed in the early stages of the pandemic, before the JobKeeper and
JobSeeker support measures were announced. This scenario suggests total unemployment of 1,694,500. This
is similar to the severe scenario, but as noted in chapter two, the distribution of job losses by industry grouping
is different. The simulated unemployment totals are shown in figure 10.

4.2.2 Simulating housing cost burdens under the COVID-19 policy interventions
A key measure that reflects the affordability faced by households is their housing cost burden. Conceptually, this
is a household’s housing cost expressed as a percentage of household gross income. For a mortgagor, housing
cost is represented by mortgage payments; for a tenant, housing cost is represented by rent payment less any
CRA entitlement received. CRA is conceptualised as a housing assistance measure though it is paid as a cash
supplement to income support payments. Hence, it is deducted from rents in the numerator of the housing cost
burden measure while excluded from the income denominator of the housing cost burden.
The housing cost burden can be used to determine whether a household is in housing stress using the traditional
30/40 rule. Under this rule, a household is in housing stress when the household’s housing cost burden is greater
than 30 per cent and the household falls into the bottom 40 per cent of the household income distribution. To
determine whether a household is in the bottom 40 per cent of the income distribution, following previous AHURI
housing affordability research by Yates (2007), we apply the modified OECD equivalence scale to equivalise
household disposable income. The households that fall into the bottom 40 per cent of the income distribution
are defined as having a low income.
After simulating the policy interventions, we were able to estimate housing cost burdens and housing stress
incidences under a range of economic scenarios. In particular, the housing cost burden is affected by COVID-19
and related policy interventions as follows:
•

JobKeeper and JobSeeker payments and the Coronavirus Supplement boost income in the denominator of
the housing cost burden measure.

•

Rent relief reduces housing cost in the numerator of the housing cost burden measure.

•

JobSeeker, the Coronavirus Supplement and Rent relief can all influence eligibility for CRA entitlements, which
in turn affects housing cost in the numerator of the burden measure.

4.3 Results: JobKeeper, JobSeeker and the coronavirus
Table six summarises the full set of results for the ‘Treasury’ scenario (which is designed to approximate the
3.5 million people reported to be on JobKeeper in phase one). Without the JobKeeper and JobSeeker payments,
it is predicted that 1,336,000 households would have experienced HAS once CRA was calculated and deducted
from housing costs. This drops to 861,000 when the phase one criteria are applied (compared to the 757,000
households in the baseline, recalling that this is defined as the observed 2018 number of households in HAS).
On this basis, it is clear that the JobKeeper, JobSeeker and Coronavirus supplement were very effective in
reducing the burden of housing costs, when working in conjunction with CRA. The intervention was also effective
in reducing the number of investor households who are in danger of being unable to meet their own housing
costs. This simulated number drops from 124,000 to 92,000 but remains considerably higher than the 49,000
predicted at the baseline.
It is notable that the number of households with a mortgage and experiencing housing affordability stress drops
by a smaller proportion than private renter equivalents (from 469,000 to 350,000 or 10% compared to 18% for
private renters). The impact on social renters is milder still, reflecting the lower starting numbers in HAS.
As the simulations move from phase one to phases two and three, the predicted number of households living in
HAS gradually rises by a further 66,000. Almost all of these households are private renters. Moving to phase four
increases the number of households in HAS by approximately 124,000 compared to phase one, and almost all of
these households are private renters.
As indicated earlier in the report, the ‘Treasury’ scenario is static in terms of its assumptions about the economy
and labour market. As such, the presumption is that all 3.5 million of the current recipients of JobKeeper and
JobSeeker remain out of work, but experience a reduction in the level of their benefits as the phases of the
intervention play out. At this stage, the analysis does not reflect any assumptions about economic recovery
during the period, or into 2021.
Finally, we can see that a combination of CRA, phase four and a crude 25 per cent rent relief scenario has the
most powerful impact on simulated numbers in HAS of all the interventions modelled in this scenario. Total
households in HAS would fall to 745,000 – a level slightly below the baseline. Naturally, the impacts on mortgaged
home owners and investors are minimal. This is a function of the fact that rent relief is targeted at private renters.
Investors are also much more likely to be mortgaged home owners than private renters.

4.4 Results: Simulations for 2021
We now turn to the simulation results for the 2021 economic scenarios, and the smaller set of policy interventions.
To recap, we examine three scenarios: ‘pre-JobKeeper pattern’, ‘mild’ and ‘severe’, as explained earlier in the
chapter. We examine the impact of CRA, phase four of JobKeeper and JobSeeker, and a crude 25 per cent rent
relief policy.
For all three scenarios, we predict that a phase four of JobKeeper, when combined with CRA, would be more than
sufficient to reduce the total number of households in HAS to a figure below the original baseline. In keeping with
previous analyses, the benefits disproportionately accrue to private renters, but the figures for mortgage holders
and social renters are also slightly lower.
CRA is not sufficient to fully mitigate the impacts of an economic downturn in any of the three scenarios.
Households in HAS rise from the baseline 757,000 to at least 793,000 (mild) or as high as 893,000 (severe). We
can easily see that a combination of CRA, phase four JobKeeper and 25 per cent rent relief has an enormous
impact on the total numbers in HAS.
Finally, households living with HAS and owning an investment property themselves are predicted to be greater in
number by between 2,000 and 13,000, depending on which economic scenario is used. A phase four JobKeeper
intervention would reduce these numbers slightly, but not as far as the original baseline numbers.

4.5 Profile of people living in HAS
An analysis of descriptive statistics revealed some differences in the attributes of individuals living in HAS
between some of the scenarios, and when compared to the baseline. For example:
•

In the severe and ‘Treasury’ scenarios, 15 per cent and 26 per cent respectively of 15 to 34 year olds are living
in HAS, compared to 12 per cent in the baseline.

•

In the ‘Treasury’ scenario, 15 per cent are couples compared to 20 per cent in the baseline, and 26 per cent
are lone parents compared to 17 per cent in the baseline.

•

In the ‘Treasury’ scenario, 23 per cent of individuals affected are in New South Wales (14% baseline) and 18 per
cent in Victoria (9% baseline).

•

In the ‘Treasury’ scenario 56 per cent of individuals in HAS have an education Year 12 or less, compared to
41 per cent in the ‘severe’ scenario, and 34 per cent in the baseline.

•

The effects of interventions assist a significantly higher proportion of private renters than mortgage holders
such that more than 51 per cent more mortgagees are in HAS in the ‘Treasury’ phase one scenario compared
to the baseline.

•

The severe 2021 scenario shows a similar pattern, with 28 per cent of individuals living in HAS being
mortgaged home owners compared to the 30 per cent baseline prediction. This demonstrates the stabilising
effect of CRA entitlement.

•

In all scenarios, females aged 55 or over are approximately 5 percentage points more likely to be in HAS
(e.g. in the baseline 17% of males, but 22% of females).

•

Those in casual employment are almost twice as likely to be in HAS in the ‘Treasury’ scenario (33%) compared
to the baseline (17%).

•

Those outside major cities are more likely to be in HAS in the ‘Treasury’ scenario (21%), compared to the
baseline (12%).

5. Policy development options
In March 2020, the Australian Government made a swift and decisive decision to introduce a radical set of
reforms designed to support households’ incomes, protect jobs and promote early economic recovery. The
economic shocks imposed by the SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) pandemic are unprecedented, and the full impacts and
knock-on consequences are difficult to predict. This final report focuses on the potential impacts to households
and their ability to meet their housing costs in the face of economic uncertainty, reduced incomes and potential
widespread job losses.
As the JobKeeper and JobSeeker interventions are gradually wound back, there are some important but currently
unanswered questions. The answers to these questions can be informed by the findings set out in this report. The
key questions are as follows:
•

To what extent is the phasing of income supports well timed in terms of economic recovery?

•

What is the right balance between withdrawing supports as the economy recovers, and withdrawing supports
to pressure individuals back into the labour market?

•

Is the design of the current interventions appropriate in terms of targeting the right individuals and
households (i.e. those facing the most precarious of labour market and housing system circumstances)?

•

Should the current interventions be phased out completely after March 2021, or is there a case for continued
support after this?

5.1 New findings set out in this research
In this project, we reviewed and synthesised the small, niche literature on the economic consequences of
pandemics. We found that the predicted impacts on GDP ranged from 1 per cent to 7 per cent. However, these
predictions were based on milder SARS or influenza pandemic scenarios. Predictions about impacts of COVID-19
on Australia’s GDP range from a 5 per cent drop to a 25 per cent drop. However, most other studies suggest a
strong recovery after the initial lockdown phase(s), including possible second or third waves, resulting in a 2021
position that may be somewhere between 4 per cent and 5 per cent lower than 2019 GDP in real terms.
Early predictions included employment loss of up to 25 per cent. Fortunately, it is clear that the impact of
COVID-19 has been somewhat mitigated, aided by Australian Government interventions. However, the job losses
and potential future job losses that COVID-19 has caused are concentrated in public-facing industries including
arts, leisure, accommodation and food services. This has the potential to dispropoprtionately impact specific
groups of individuals and households.
We established a baseline set of estimates of unemployment and numbers of households affected by living in
HAS. We then applied economic scenarios, modelled propensities to become unemployed, and simulated the
impacts of policy interventions. The latter was centred on the Australian Government’s JobKeeper and JobSeeker
measures, and the Coronavirus supplement.

5. Policy development options 

We found that large scale job losses mirrored by the total number of Australians (3.5 million) on JobKeeper would
have resulted in 1,336,000 households living in HAS without the intervention, after accounting for eligibility for
CRA. The JobKeeper, JobSeeker and Coronavirus supplement were very effective in reducing the burden of
housing costs, when working in conjunction with CRA. The number of households in HAS drops to 861,000 when
these interventions are taken into account. We also found that the number of households in HAS, who also own
an investment property, would have risen from a 49,000 baseline to 124,000 without these interventions. With the
interventions, the number rises to 92,000 households.
As the interventions move through subsequent phases and are withdrawn, the number of households in HAS
rises by a further 62,000 to 66,000, reaching 124,000 more households when the interventions are withdrawn
altogether. However, this scenario assumes that current recipients of the income support measures do not
regain employment.
Based on a survey of the literature, and a review of ABS statistics, we established two economic scenarios for
2021 – each of which is associated with assumed job losses by economic sector. We also referred to a 2021
scenario based on the pattern and distribution of job losses observed by an early study (D’Souza 2020). This is
an important scenario to consider because the rapid introduction of the JobKeeper and related income support
measures, and their relatively crude design, will almost certainly have caused labour market distortions. Data on
the actual job losses observed prior to the introduction of these interventions may therefore represent a plausible
outcome of realised job losses after the withdrawal of the interventions.
The analysis suggests that CRA, in isolation, is not sufficient to mitigate the impacts of an economic downturn
in 2021 as measured by numbers of households living in HAS. Numbers will rise to at least 793,000, and could
be as high as 893,000 (depending on which economic scenario is consulted). We calculated that a hypothetical
phase four of JobKeeper, when combined with CRA, would be more than sufficient to reduce the total number
of households in HAS to a figure below the original baseline.
We also found that rent relief measures (crudely modelled as a 25% rebate on rent) have a higher impact on
numbers in HAS than CRA. For example, under our ‘severe’ 2021 economic scenario, HAS numbers are simulated
as 893,000 after the application of CRA. This falls by 20 per cent when a hypothetical JobKeeper phase four
intervention is factored in, but a further 30 per cent on application of a hypothetical 25 per cent rent relief.

5.2 Final remarks
Our aim in this report has been to provide insight into existing and possible future economic scenarios facing
Australian workers and their households, and to examine the possible consequences to their ability to meet
housing costs. We found that the number of households living in a precarious situation is very high, and will likely
remain high even after a partial recovery in 2021 and the withdrawal of much of the Australian Government’s
income support measures. Without an extension of the JobKeeper income support measures beyond March
2021, the number of households living in HAS is likely to increase significantly. We find that the hypothetical
phase four JobKeeper is more than sufficient to reduce the number of households in HAS below the baseline.
This hypothetical extension would see a reduced JobKeeper payment ($650 per fortnight compared to $1,500
in phase one) and nil Coronavirus supplement (compared to $500 in phase one).
We therefore argue that the winding back and phasing out of income support interventions may be premature,
and will likely increase the number of households potentially unable to meet their own housing costs.
Consideration should be given to additional supports after March 2021, although there is a case for clearer
targeting of supports towards those in greatest need.

5. Policy development options 

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on younger workers, and those working in less secure
public facing occupations. Lower income workers and private renters are disproportionately affected. We suggest
that serious consideration should be given to the development of further support measures that would benefit
the household categories identified. Consideration might be given to rent relief schemes since it is clear that
these, working in conjunction with CRA, have a strong impact on reducing housing affordability stress. We note
that a national 25 per cent rent relief scheme (in addition to the CRA and the hypothetical JobKeeper phase four)
would reduce the number of HAS cases by 30 per cent—this is equivalent to $17.52 million per week or $73 per
case per week.
Despite the obvious potential of rent relief schemes to safeguard the housing security of the worst affected, there
is a surprising variety in what have, so far, been largely experimental rent relief schemes across Australia. With
the exceptions of Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory, most jurisdictions have implemented
land tax relief of 25 per cent to 50 per cent for a limited period. This is conditional on residential landlords
demonstrating that rent relief has been passed on to tenants (whether partially or in full – the arrangements vary
by state and territory). In some areas, partial deferments of tax liability have also been offered. However, there
are remaining questions about the optimal design of such schemes, the correct balance between incentives
to landlords and proportion passed on to tenants, the level of uptake, whether uptake should be voluntary or
mandatory, and the impact of such interventions on improving housing outcomes for tenants. These remaining
questions should be the urgent focus of any additional research in this area.
