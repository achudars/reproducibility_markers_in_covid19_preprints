"7" "When the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak began on January 31, 2020, no-one could have anticipated the impact that it would have on our scholarly communica tion and publishing systems. That is, perhaps, unless you work on open source software. Right now, global research communities are united to collaborate on solving the threat of the pandemic, sharing resources and knowledge more efficiently and effective t han ever before, a process broadly described as ‘open scholarship’  (Dunleavy, 2020) . This is essentially akin to how free and open source software (FOSS) communities have been operating now for  decades  (Willinsky, 2005) . Recently, we participated in a “massively open online paper”, or MOOP, that explored the intersections between FOSS and open scholarship  (Tennant, Agarwal, et al., 2020) . Here, we want to summarise our key findings from that project, and place them in the context of the current outbreak. Critically, this pandemic shows us that many of the pervasive and system ic issues surrounding the evaluation, valuation, use and operationalisation of “openness” in scholarship can be extremely easily bypassed when the social demand and urgency is there, thus showing that the primary barriers towards open scholarship are inher ently political and not technical."
"8" "Our first major finding was, although perhaps not particularly novel, the most important and relevant to the current outbreak. Open source software communities place collaboration at their core, as embodied in the fundame ntal freedoms for participation and re-use  (Katz et al., 2018) . Through an  iterative process of contribution, and not just from software developers, functional ‘products’ are designed, tested, a nd improved. With SARS-CoV-2, we are seeing new communities developing and tools based around such inclusive and large-scale participation forming. For example, Just One Giant Lab (JOGL) is hosting a diverse community of researchers and non-researchers fro m community laboratories around the world to collaborate on building open-source methodologies and equipment to prevent SARS-CoV-2, test for the virus and treat its symptoms  (Baden et al., 2020) . These communities are bypassing traditional disciplinary boundaries, recognising that complex problems require approaching that complexity within a radically collaborative framework  (Fecher, 2 020) . These communities of practice are similar to those from open source communities, and ‘hackers’, with a radically inclusive participation model, and open collaboration geared towards solving very specific problems with the resources at hand."
"9" "Openness,  as a series of movements, combines a range of principles and practices that together represent a blend of ideology and pragmatism  (Masuzzo & Martens, 2017; Mulkay, 1976) . Key within this for so ftware and scholarship is the concept of freedom - to access, participate, share, and re-use software, knowledge, tools, ideas, data, materials, and more. What has come to the foreground with SARS-CoV-2 is that these same freedoms do not currently exist fo r scholarship in any widespread manner, and are often constrained even within systems that claim to be ‘open’. Indeed, many of those who we have entrusted these freedoms to (i.e., scholarly publishers and other vendors) have now implicitly revealed to us t hat they violate these freedoms as part of their regular practices by prohibiting access and re-use to knowledge that should be being used to save lives. This problem reflects a wider one in that open scholarship, and all that it encompasseses, is at sever e risk of being co-opted by commercial systems and proprietary players  (Posada & Chen, 2018) . Token gestures from commercial players about making some relevant research on the outbreak temporari ly ‘free’ to access within their proprietary systems show that, ultimately, control of vital knowledge to help combat SARS-CoV-2 and other global health crises is in the hands of capitalist systems that will not yield control to it while it still has fiduc iary value to them. The inescapable conclusion is that the exploitation of knowledge by these commercial actors must come to an end, as it is clearly an impediment to improving public health and society. At the present, this tension between openness and pr oprietary or commercial systems does not seem to have fully appreciated the lessons from software communities in this regard."
"10" "Preprints and data do not have impact factors. Researchers who have been collaborating on solving this problem have done so while,  in many cases, totally bypassing the current systems of peer review, and simultaneously ignoring our generally dysfunctional research evaluation systems  (Alperin et al., 2018; Brembs, 2018; Bre mbs et al., 2013; Lariviere & Sugimoto, 2018) . Virtually all of the major problems in modern scholarship systems can be traced to a  corrupt and institutionalised research assessment system, based on the mis-use of data and metrics, and the coupling of reputation and reward. How communities are curre ntly working on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic should serve as a wake-up call to those in charge of modern evaluation systems to see that they are ineffective, and must be retooled to recognise a broader range of practices and outputs beyond traditional peer revi ew and research articles. Open scholarship is perhaps different to software here in that it thrives on pluralism and complexity  (Şentürk, 2001) , and we need to make sure that this is fundamental ly recognised in future evaluation systems that value a new type of relationship between science and society  (Tennant, Francuzik, et al., 2020) ."
"11" "We now know that the infrastructural capacity to  support open scholarship exists, at least in part. We know now that the motivation to use it at-scale and to solve specific problems exists; all it required was another global pandemic to catalyse. Drawing on the successes (and failures) of global FOSS com munities, we believe that there is substantial scope for further national and institutional investment through new mandates that require researchers to collaborate and communicate more effectively, akin to FOSS communities and open scholarship. This would  simultaneously help to support communities to remain autonomous and in control of their work, rather than having them captured and enclosed by commercial entities that continue to threaten and prohibit optimal researcher behaviours. We believe that by look ing more into the successes, and failures, of software communities, we can gain valuable insight into developing research communities that are better equipped with knowledge, tools, and capacity for helping to mitigate future pandemics when they arise."
