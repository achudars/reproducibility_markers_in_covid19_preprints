Considering Elite Network Patterns in Application to Infectious Disease
Spread
Karl F. Vachuska

Abstract
Anecdotal evidence suggests the elite may be more likely to contract an infectious
disease during a pandemic, especially earlier on. In this paper, I propose general
patterns for how the elite may experience contact differently and then utilizing
mathematical models, simulate how those general patterns may affect infection
rates among the elite and general population during a pandemic.

Introduction
In this paper, I will consider contact networks in the context of the elite as it
is relevant to infectious disease spread. During the COVID-19 Pandemic, celebrities
were infected with Coronavirus at a seemingly disproportionate rate, especially
early on. I consider a novel hypothesis in that the modern emergence of “wealth
work” has led to elite populations being subject to higher initial infection rates.
Through mathematical models and simulations, I demonstrate that this is a
plausible effect. I additionally find more substantial evidence indicating that wealth
work may accelerate overall initial infection rates. Analyzing empirical data, I find
some evidence that counties with more wealth work had higher initial infection
rates.

Celebrities and Coronavirus
During the very early stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Western
Hemisphere, numerous celebrities, including professional athletes, actors, and
politicians, had announced testing positive for the disease. While transmission of
the disease was widespread, even in the most infected parts of the western world
early on in the pandemic (mid-March 2020), only approximately 0.02% of the
population had contracted the disease. This raises the question, are celebrities/elites
more likely to contract Coronavirus earlier in the Pandemic, and if so, why?

For several reasons, the question of whether or not elites are more likely to
get Coronavirus is challenging to create evidence for or against statistically. This is
because it is hard to measure “fame” or “eliteness” objectively. Additionally, a
complete list of who has Coronavirus is unavailable, for obvious reasons of medical
confidentiality, so we primarily must rely on people publicly announcing they have
tested positive for Coronavirus. An additional confounding factor is that not
everyone who has Coronavirus may be tested for it, leading to a selection bias in
that celebrities who have Coronavirus may receive tests for it at a higher frequency
than non-celebrities.
A simplistic statistical attempt to estimate the number of famous people
estimated that between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 2,000 people in the English-speaking
world are famous. (Arbesman 2013) Taking the higher estimate, 1 in 2,000 people or
(0.05% of the population). Between the United States and the United Kingdom, the
two English-speaking countries with the highest number of Coronavirus cases as of
March 16th, 2020, there was a total of slightly over 5,000 confirmed cases of
Coronavirus. Between these two countries, there were at least ten people with
Wikipedia articles who were residents of the country. This suggests that
approximately 1 in 500 people who have confirmed cases of Coronavirus have
Wikipedia articles, a disproportionately higher percentage, even compared to the
most liberal estimates for the number of famous people. This statistical
investigation is relatively simple but provides some primary evidence that
celebrities were more likely to get Coronavirus earlier on in the pandemic.

Elite Networks
Past research has found that celebrities tend to have social ties to other
celebrities, and celebrities tend to have low degrees of separation from one another.
(Gilad, Ravid and Currid-Halkett 2013) In general, individuals tend to have social
ties to individuals who are of similar economic and social class to themselves.
(McPherson et al 2001) Additionally, social networks tend to have high degrees of
clustering. (Watts and Strogatz 1998)
Since social networks are meant for the transmission of information, social
networks cannot wholly explain the transmission of disease, since interpersonal or
merely proximal contact does not reflect social networks. Instead, there may be a
significant difference between the two. While celebrities’ social networks often
include other celebrities, or merely other people with high economic and social class,
evidence suggests celebrities may have a high degree of contact with people of lower
social and economic classes, due to to their high level of financial expenditure, and
the subsequent broad and miscellaneous services they receive from various workers
of lower classes.
“Wealth Work” is one of the most rapidly growing categories of occupations.
(Autor and Salomans 2019) Wealth work includes jobs such as “yoga instruction,
sommelier services, pet care, and many forms of personal training and counseling”.
(Autor 2019) Wealth Work, as the name suggests, involves performing “in-person
services for affluent consumers”. (Autor 2019) Notably, individuals who perform
wealth work have about average earnings. In summary, wealth workers are of low

to middle-income status and have in-person contact with affluent individuals as
part of their occupation. As it applies to considering how an infectious disease
spreads, wealth work is a very viable possibility between which disease may be
transmitted between worker and consumer. Wealth work is rapidly growing,
accounting for 52% of new work. (Autor and Salomans 2019)
Utilizing network analysis and SIR model simulations, I consider several
hypotheses for why elite individuals, people with very high socioeconomic status
and power, are more likely to get Coronavirus earlier in the Pandemic. The simplest
hypothesis is that elites have more extensive immediate social networks as well as
higher degrees of centrality in social networks. Another hypothesis is simply that
celebrities have a greater number of “bridges”, or social ties serving as the only link
between otherwise vastly disconnected social network clusters. I hypothesize
“wealth work” plays a critical role in why celebrities/elites are more likely to get
Coronavirus as well as, more importantly, rapidly accelerating the spread of the
disease.

The Basic “Wealth-Work” Graph
As a principle, most human networks, particularly social networks, have a
high degree of clustering. (Watts and Strogatz 1998) Further, individuals tend to
have ties to individuals with similar socioeconomic status to themselves. As such, I
organize all the graphs I create with socioeconomic status as a foundational

attribute of all actors, applied to graphs via nodes having a predetermined “order”. I
additionally ensure an essential high degree of clustering in graphs, applied in a
similar way to how Watts and Strogatz (1998) generate their small-world graphs. I
apply “wealth work” to my graphs via actors having a probability of connections to
non-neighboring actors proportional to their socioeconomic status. Later on, I
introduce variations of this where non-neighboring actors they can connect to must
be of specific socioeconomic class, but in this most general case, I allow it to be to
any non-neighboring actors.
Henceforth, I shall refer to “actors” as “nodes”, “ties” as “edges” or “connections” and
“networks” as “graphs”.

How to generate the Basic Wealth-Work graph:
Step 1: Take 𝑁 nodes such that all nodes are ordered and map to the set of natural
numbers from 1 to 𝑁
Step 2: Now, connect each node to it’s nearest 𝐾 neighbors on each side. The inner
𝑁 − 2𝐾 nodes on either side should now have 2𝐾 edges each. The 𝐾 nodes on either
end though will have only between 𝐾 and 2𝐾 − 1 edges however.
Such a graph where 𝑁 = 20 and 𝐾 = 3 would look like the following:

Step 3: Next, add edges to nodes separated by atleast 𝐾 units in the order to the
graph at probability 𝑝 where 𝑝 = 𝑐 ×

(max⁡( 𝑖,𝑗)) 2
𝑛2

where 𝑖 and 𝑗 are the unique values

associated with the two nodes.
The following resulting graph would be one in which there is a quadratic association
between a node’s associated value and having connections to nodes they are not
neighbors with.

*1 here denotes the highest ranked node, 20 denotes the lowest.
This fits the general nature of wealth work and how it is structured within
contact networks. While individual’s contact networks are generally highly
clustered and strongly organized along socioeconomic status, individuals with the
highest socioeconomic status are disproportionality likely to consume personal
services and are subsequently more likely to have contact with increasing numbers
of people outside of their relative socioeconomic status. A quadratic distribution for
income is very sensible, since there are many people with low to middle-income
spending capacities but significant percentages of people still exist with incomes 5-

10 times that of the median. (Other variations of 𝑝 can of course be created for this
type of graph, but for this case this function if most suitable)

Now, I will present several variations of this type of graph:
For the purposes of simplicity, all other graphs will continue following the
completion of Step 2 in the original variation above.

Simple Small-World Variation
This variation is very similar to the Newman-Watts variation of the small-world
network. (Watts and Strogatz 1998; Newman 2003)
Step 3: Add edges between nodes where they do not exist to the graph at probability
𝑝 where 𝑝 is constant.
For 𝑝 = .25 this is what a graph may potentially look like

*1 here denotes the highest ranked node, 20 denotes the lowest.

This variation is somewhat distinct from the original small-world network, besides
not consisting of a ring lattice initially, in that rather than “rewiring” edges I am
adding in new edges without deleting any of the original ones.

Elite-Clustering Variation

Step 3: Take the 𝑄 nodes with the highest order and add in edges to them, so that
they are connected to their 𝐿 closest neighbors on either side (where 𝐿 > 𝐾), rather
than simply their 𝐾 closest neighbors.
For 𝑄 = 5 and 𝐿 = 5, this would produce the following graph

*1 here denotes the highest ranked node, 20 denotes the lowest.

This scenario is analogous to one in which a subset of actors in a network
have more connections than the rest of the actors while maintaining a high degree
of clustering. Some evidence suggests that elite individuals simply have more
connections while still tending to only have connections with the individuals of the

same socioeconomic status. This models that scenario fairly purely. Notably, this
graph has no randomization to it and is completely determined by the specific
parameters.

Poor Wealth-Worker Variation
Step 3: Next, add edges to nodes separated by atleast 𝐾 units in the order to the
graph at probability 𝑝 where 𝑝 = 𝑐 ×

(max⁡( 𝑖,𝑗)) 2
𝑛2

where min (𝑖, 𝑗) < 𝐵 .

For 𝐵 = 10 the following is a what a possible graph may look like:

*1 here denotes the highest ranked node, 20 denotes the lowest.

The role of the limiting value 𝐵 is to ensure that non-neighboring edges connect
specifically to nodes at the bottom. This is analogous to the scenario as posed by the
service industry broadly, where service workers tend to have low socioeconomic
status serving individuals of very high socioeconomic status.

Specific Wealth Worker Variation
Step 3: Next, assign the label of “worker” to nodes with probability 𝑞 where the
nodes rank 𝑖 < 𝐵
Step 4: Connect each “worker” node to higher ranked node 𝑗 at probability 𝑝 =
𝑐×

(max⁡( 𝑖,𝑗)) 2
𝑛2

A potential graph would look like this:

*1 here denotes the highest ranked node, 20 denotes the lowest.

This variation of the graph seeks to most accurately represent the concept of
“wealth work”, where specific wealth workers serve large numbers of affluent
consumers.

Model Comparison
The SIR model is one of the most commonly used mathematical models of
infectious disease spread. In my simple version, all nodes are either S (Susceptible),

I (infected), or R (Recovered). A Susceptible node can become Infected in the next
step with probability 1 − (1 − 𝑝)𝑥 where 𝑥 is the number of nodes that it is tied to
that are infected, and 𝑝 is the probability of transmission. Otherwise, a susceptible
node remains susceptible in the next step with the complementary probability,
(1 − 𝑝)𝑥 . An infected node becomes recovered in the next step with probability 1. A
recovered node remains recovered in the next step with probability 1.
For a very large graph, we can somewhat simply express the number of
infected nodes through a small number of steps 𝑀, in the scenario such that the
graph is so large and 𝑀 is so small such that the probability any two randomly
selected nodes on have values within (𝑀 × 𝐾) + ((𝑀 − 1) × 𝐾) is effectively zero.
I will denote the expected number of nodes that have been infected at or by
time 𝑀 as 𝐸[𝐺𝑀 ]
Time 1, or Step 1, for the purposes here, will be defined as in which the
disease is introduced into the network, and exactly one node is infected.
An important expression I will additionally be using is 𝐸[𝑊𝑀 |𝐾 = 𝐾𝑖 ] which
describes the number of infected nodes at or by time 𝑀 for a graph 𝑊 with a large
number of nodes such that the only edges that exist are to the nearest 𝐾𝑖 nodes on
either side. This hypothetical graph is equivalent to how any of our graphs would be
at the conclusion of Step 2.
It’s obvious that 𝐸[𝑊1 |𝐾 = 𝐾𝑖 ] = 1

And is fairly trivial that 𝐸 [𝑊2 |𝐾 = 𝐾𝑖 ] = 𝑝 × 2𝐾𝑖 when the probability of
transmission is 𝑝
For any higher number of 𝑀 it’s fairly complicated to express an exact solution.
Subsequently, for my purposes, it is simpler to merely state that for all 𝑀,
𝐸[𝑊𝑀 |𝐾 = 𝐾𝑖 + 𝑙 ] ≥ ⁡𝐸[𝑊𝑀 |𝐾 = 𝐾𝑖 ] + (𝑝 × 𝑀 × 2𝑙 )
This is a fairly useful bound for arbitrary purposes, since as 𝑀 → ∞ or as 𝑝 → 1
𝐸 [𝑊𝑀 |𝐾 = 𝐾𝑖 + 𝑙] → ⁡𝐸[𝑊𝑀 |𝐾 = 𝐾𝑖 ] + (𝑝 × 𝑀 × 2𝑙 )

Additionally, it is possible to calculate infection rates for “elite” nodes for each
graph. These solutions are very similar for the most part and are listed in the
appendix.

These solutions suggest implications for the rate we can expect infections to
spread across different graph variations early on, as well as in an early number of
steps how disproportionality infected elite nodes will be. While maintaining a
consistent number of total edges across all variations, I would expect the ratio
between Elite nodes’ and Average nodes’ infection rates to generally be highest in

the Elite Clustering variation, presuming a low value for 𝑄𝐸𝐶 . For the Elite
Clustering Variation, the ratio essentially scales with (𝐾𝑖 + 𝐿)/𝐾𝑖 and 𝑀, thus easily
allowing Elite nodes to be infected at a much faster rate than the average node.

While these equations provide exact solutions to estimating how the disease may
spread through an infinitely large network, real simulation on finite sized graphs
can provide potentially more realistic insight on disease spread:
For all graphs I set 𝑁 = 10000, and 𝐾 = 3. I further assign 𝑐 = .001 for the Basic
Wealth Work graph, and subsequent parameters are all assigned according to give
each graph variation an equal number of expected edges.
For each variation I generated 100 random graphs, and simulated disease spread
with probability 𝑝 = .5 for 10 trials starting with randomly selected node to be
infected in each graph, totaling 1000 simulations.
The following figure depicts the percentage of nodes that are or have been infected
by step:

The SWW and PWW graphs have highest initial infection rates. Their
infection rates are eventually outpaced by that of the BWW and SW graphs which
have less variation in the shortest distance between any two nodes, thus allowing
infection to reach all nodes fairly quickly. While the SWW and PWW graphs can
more rapidly infect a larger number of nodes, it takes longer for infection to reach
all nodes in these variations. In the EC graph, infection is extremely slow, directly
attributable to nodes only connecting to neighboring nodes, and thus infection only
moving by limited increments.

If we consider “elite” nodes to be nodes in the top 1% of the order, we can compare
how quickly elite nodes would contract the disease generally, as well as relative to
the average node.
The following figure depicts the percentage of elite nodes that are or have been
infected by step:

Again, the SWW and PWW graphs have faster initial infection rates, but the
BWW and SW graphs outpace them later on. While little distinction in infection
rate existed between the BWW and SW graphs for all node, for “elite” nodes BWW
clearly has a generally higher infection rate. The EC graph again is moving
extremely slowly.
The following figures display the ratio of elite node’s probability of being or having
been infected relative to the average node’s probability of being or having been
infected by step:

As my equations suggested, the Elite Clustering variation has the highest
ratio of Elite node’s infection rate to average node’s infection rate. The Basic Wealth
World variation and Specific Wealth Worker variation additionally, both have high
ratios, close to 2:1 in early steps. The Small World Variation and the Poor Wealth
Worker variation have generally equal or less than equal rates of Elite node
infection rate relative to average nodes.

Empirical Analysis
The New York Times has compiled a dataset of the number of Coronavirus
cases for the entire United States by day. Utilizing this dataset, I computed
exponential regressions for the March 11th through March 25th, 2020 timeframe for
all counties that had one to five confirmed cases on March 11th. I choose this
timeframe to minimize the confounding impact of shelter-in-place orders on growth
rates. (The first statewide shelter-in-place went into effect on March 19th,
Coronavirus symptoms show up typically at least 5 days after infection, and test

results take 1-2 days in order for a potential case to be “confirmed”) Combining this
growth rate datapoint with data from the 2014-2018 American Community Survey
estimates, I tested my hypotheses.
As Table One shows, the interaction between the percent of occupations in
personal service and income inequality is positively associated with counties’
Coronavirus growth rate. As greater income inequality suggests greater
stratification by income within the community, counties with higher income
inequality and more personal service jobs would presumably tend to have more
consumption of personal services (and subsequent contact). That consumption of
personal services would further presumably be concentrated among higher-income
individuals, given the higher income inequality.

Discussion
This paper proposes different patterns that may arise from and/or
characterize the stratification/presence of elite nodes in a contact network. I
initially emphasize “wealth work” as a possible explanation for why elite individuals
may get infected earlier on in an infectious disease pandemic. My simulations find
some supporting evidence for this, demonstrating “wealth work” characteristics, as
represented in my “Specific Wealth Worker” graph, does lead to higher infection
rates among “elite” nodes at early steps. However, this ratio seems somewhat
limited, and my simulations indicate any differences in infection rates of
substantial magnitude are likely better explained by an “elite clustering”

phenomenon wherein elite individuals simply have more massive clusters than nonelite individuals. My simulations do suggest that “wealth work” characteristics may
generally accelerate the spread of infectious disease, which I find empirical support
for in analyzing county-level COVID-19 data. While I broadly propose different elite
contact network characteristics, I examine them separately, and further research
should better explore the interaction between these patterns.
