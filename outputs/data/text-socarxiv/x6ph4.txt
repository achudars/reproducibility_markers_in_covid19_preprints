Abstract
In the social upheaval arising from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we do not yet know how
union formation, particularly marriage, has been affected. Using administration records—marriage certificates and
applications—gathered from settings representing a variety of COVID-19 experiences in the United States, the authors
compare counts of recorded marriages in 2020 against those from the same period in 2019. There is a dramatic
decrease in year-to-date cumulative marriages in 2020 compared with 2019 in each case. Similar patterns are observed
for the Seattle metropolitan area when analyzing the cumulative number of marriage applications, a leading indicator of
marriages in the near future. Year-to-date declines in marriage are unlikely to be due solely to closure of government
agencies that administer marriage certification or reporting delays. Together, these findings suggest that marriage has
declined during the COVID-19 outbreak and may continue to do so, at least in the short term.

marriage, COVID-19, administrative data
More than 7.9 million infections and 212,000 coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths have been recorded in the
United States (Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center
2020). In addition to its health impacts, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on all aspects of social life.
Interestingly, little is known about how COVID-19, and the
resulting governmental and social responses, may influence
union formation, particularly marriage.
How the coronavirus pandemic may shape marriage is
unclear because past studies examining the impact of disasters on marriage offer mixed accounts. Some researchers
have documented increases in marriage following earthquakes and hurricanes (Cicatiello et al. 2019; Xu and Feng
2016). Others have found the opposite following earthquakes
(Hamamatsu et al. 2014; Prati and Pietrantoni 2014) and
floods (Ahmed 2018). The overall implication of these studies is that the impact of disasters is sensitive to duration, the
timing of events, and location.
Drawing on existing relationship models, scholars have
suggested that the stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic will
likely threaten romantic relationships (Pietromonaco and
Overall 2020). Documented relationship consequences of
COVID-19 include increased relationship conflict (Luetke
et al. 2020), reduced sexual frequency (Lehmiller et al.
2020), and high rates of contacting alternative sexual and

romantic partners (Lehmiller et al. 2020). COVID-19 has
also created uncertainty in income, employment, or housing
stability, which may threaten single men’s and women’s ability to meet the economic prerequisites to marriage and delay
transitions into marriage (Oppenheimer 1988). Governmental
policies may also reduce marriages. For example, gathering
limitations may prevent weddings and office closures may
prevent marriage certification. Nonetheless, there are also
COVID-19-induced changes that may increase single people’s need to transition into marriage. Prior to COVID-19,
approximately a quarter of married, working-age men and
half of such women reported receiving health insurance
through a household member’s private coverage (U.S.
Census Bureau 2019). These plans are commonly employer
based and employers that provide health insurance to
employees almost universally extend coverage to spouses as
well (Kaiser Family Foundation 2019). As millions of

Americans lost jobs in 2020 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
2020) and potentially access to employer-based insurance,
demand for marriage may have increased as a function of
demand for spousal health plans. Dependence on health
insurance provided by the spouse’s employers could incentivize marriage in response to the pandemic.
Using administrative data from several different locations
across the country, we provide a basic description of changes
in marriage rates following COVID-19. Although the pandemic and its aftereffects will continue, we provide a description of how the pandemic has shaped marriage patterns, at
least in the near term.

Data
We rely on administrative data—marriage certificates and
applications—from multiple locations in the United States.
The novelty of COVID-19 and delays in survey collection due
to the pandemic mean that existing survey data sets have not
yet captured meaningful variation in recent marriage behavior,
constraining our ability to examine changes in marriage
behavior coinciding with COVID-19. Administrative data on
marriages can fill this void by providing us access to realtime sources of data with no additional respondent burden.
The general administrative process of marriage tends to be
similar across different regions and states in the United States.
This process generally occurs in two stages. First, the couple
appears in person at the relevant local office to apply for their
marriage license. In places that release administrative data on
marriage, the marriage license application date is available
with a minimal delay. All localities in our study from which
we use application data make complete information on applications available with a processing delay of two days at most.
After the ceremony, the newlyweds need to return their marriage licenses within the amount of time specified by the
granting agency, which then reviews and processes the marriage certificate. Unlike the marriage application data, there is
a lag between the marriage date and the time when marriage
data become available, even before the pandemic. For example, for marriages formed in April 2019 in Dallas County,
Texas, the median lag between marriage date and availability
of marriage license data online was approximately 13 days; of
the 1,408 non-common-law marriage in this period, 1,360
(96.6 percent) were registered by the end of the next month
(May).1 Processing delays for marriage records—delays that
represent both the time until the license is returned and the
time to process returned licenses—for a typical source of
county-level marriage data in 2019 are graphed in Supplemental
Figure 1. For states that report provisional marriage data, an
additional delay is caused by state offices’ collating countylevel marriage data. Despite this delay, state-level estimates

because of process differences in their creation. The inclusion of
the nine common-law marriages registered in this period does not
substantially alter this description.

appear relatively stable within 60 days. For example, recorded
marriages in Florida for June 2020 increased by only 21 marriages (0.2 percent) between September and October 2020.
During the pandemic, most county clerks’ offices continued their record processing, including marriage applications
and licenses. Local governments, including those we examine in our study, have not changed eligibility requirements
for marriage, the expiration date of the marriage license, or
the allowed amount of time for couples to return the marriage
certificate after the ceremony. One notable change in the
administration marriage process has been that, in many
places, couples are now required to file their marriage application online and make an appointment before appearing in
person to verify their identities and receive their license.
There has been surprisingly little increase in the amount of
lag between the marriage date and the time when data become
available. For example, in Dallas County, the median delay in
processing time for recording marriages is lower following
the pandemic than it was in 2019 (Supplemental Table 1).
The overall implication is that processing delays are, at
worst, similar to delays prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Using existing administrative data imposes the limitations
inherent in such collections. Federal collection of administrative marriage data has not been undertaken in the United States
for decades, resulting in patchwork collection nationwide. To
examine how marriage behavior has changed before and after
the start of the pandemic, we focus on administrative marriage
data from four locations: Florida, Hawaii, the Dallas–Fort
Worth–Arlington (DFW) metropolitan statistical area (MSA),
and the Seattle MSA. Collection of data from online sources
occurred on October 6, 2020. A complete list of data sources is
available in Supplemental Table 2. It is worth noting that we
relied on marriage license data for the first three locations but
marriage application data for the Seattle MSA.
We focus on Florida and Hawaii because these two states
have publicly available data on marriages statewide. These
states also offer interesting comparisons, as they capture two
extremes in COVID-19 responses. Relative to other states,
Florida was both late to announce stay-at-home orders
(April 1) and early to begin reopening (May 4). In contrast,
Hawaii mandated quarantine for all visitors and returning
residents and imposed a stay-at-home order in March. Florida
and Hawaii also differ in their experience of the pandemic to
date, with Florida reporting 3,450 COVID-19 cases per
100,000 population (the fourth worst state) and Hawaii reporting 970 cases per 100,000 population (the fifth best state).
Marriage data in these states are available as monthly totals.
Although current state counts are provisional, as noted, we
have observed that state-level marriage counts are relatively
stable two months following marriage (e.g., July marriages are
subject to only minor changes as of the end of October). We
restrict our state samples to data through July 2020.
Using state-level data ignores population heterogeneity that
could obscure the effects of COVID-19 on marriage.
Specifically, cases and fatalities in the early COVID-19 experience have been primarily located in large urban areas (Zhang

Wagner et al.
and Schwartz 2020). To focus on marriage in such a setting, we
explore marriage data in the DFW MSA. The DFW MSA is
fourth largest MSA in the United States, with an estimated
2019 population of more than 7.5 million (U.S. Census Bureau
2020) and the largest with publicly available marriage data.
We gathered marriage certificates for both formal and common-law marriages from 8 of the 11 counties in the MSA
(details are available in Supplemental Table 1).2 We use data
from the entire metropolitan area rather than from a single
county to address couples applying in neighboring counties
where the application and license process may be seen as easier, a process observed in other Texas metropolitan areas (A.
Marcus, personal communication, August 7, 2020). Because
couples in Texas have 30 days to return their completed marriage licenses, we restrict the sample to marriages that occurred
through August 2020 (i.e., all marriage for which marriage
certification should be completed). The delay between this end
point and our data collection also minimizes marriage undercounting through processing delays. On the basis of 2019
administrative rates in the area’s largest county (Supplemental
Figure 1), this delay would correspond to less than 2.5 percent
outstanding marriages for September 2020 and even fewer for
each prior month. Although marriage information is unavailable in three counties, missing counties represent fewer than 5
percent of the area’s population and marriages.
Our final data source is marriage applications in the Seattle
MSA. Seattle was home to the first recorded COVID-19 fatality in the United States (Taylor 2020). Seattle was affected
early by the COVID-19 pandemic and may have had more time
to adjust. Marriage applications are the first step in a potentially
months-long process of marrying, as marriage licenses are
valid for months. Thus, changes in the number of marriage
applications offer a hint on future marriage trends. Furthermore,
changes in the number of marriage applications in locales that
experienced the pandemic early may also serve as an early indicator of the potential “recovery” in marriage once the initial
shock of a pandemic subsides and/or major events can no longer be postponed. To the extent that they have normalized to
prepandemic levels, this might suggest that any changes in
marriage observed in our other cases represent short-term interruptions. We limit our sample to marriage applications from
counties constituting the Seattle MSA, as of September 30,
2020, to allow for delays in administrative processing.
For each setting, we compare marriage record data from
2020 against data from the same period in 2019. This direct
comparison helps us address the seasonal variation in marriage rates in the United States. All data and analysis files are
available online (Center for Open Science 2020).

Common law marriages are marriages which have occurred without prior licensing or ceremony. Instead, a couple lives together and
presents themselves as married. In some jurisdictions, these couples
may subsequently petition the state for recognition of their status.
Though relatively rare in Texas, these marriages are described in
Texas Family Law §2.401-2.402.

Results
The left panel in Figure 1 shows the year-to-date cumulative
number of marriages in Florida for each month in 2019 and
2020. The cumulative number of year-to-date marriages was
slightly larger in February 2020 than in February 2019.3 Starting
in March 2020, Florida has issued fewer new marriages certificates than in 2019, resulting in fewer year-to-date cumulative
marriages in 2020 than in 2019. As seen in the right panel,
monthly differences in the cumulative number of marriages
increased steadily between March and July. As of July, there
were 23,627 fewer marriages recorded in Florida in 2020 than
in 2019, representing a 26 percent decrease relative to 2019.
Our results for Hawaii are like those for Florida (Figure
2). As in Florida, there were slightly more year-to-date marriages in Hawaii in February 2020 than for the same period
in 2019 but virtually no differences as of March. From April
2020 onward, a deficit in the year-to-date cumulative number of marriages emerged and increased (Figure 2, right
panel). By July 2020, 5,183 fewer marriages had occurred in
Hawaii than by the same point in 2019, which represents a 44
percent decline in the total number of marriages. A reduction
in nonresident marriages (e.g., destination weddings) is
responsible for much of this decrease, but marriage of
Hawaiian residents also decreased across this period
(Supplemental Figure 2).
A similar picture emerges for the DFW MSA (Figure 3).
For context, we superimpose the timing of the governor’s
emergency declaration. The count of 2020 marriages tracked
closely with that of 2019 marriages until the state’s emergency
declaration (Figure 3, left panel). Following this declaration,
fewer new marriages occurred. As of the end of August, there
were 9,410 fewer marriages in 2020 than in 2019 in the DFW
MSA, which represents almost a 27 percent reduction in marriages (Figure 3, right panel). Much like marriages in Florida
and Hawaii, marriages in this Texas metropolitan area continue to decline relative to their prepandemic level.
We assess the prospects of the “recovery” of marriage by
comparing the year-to-date cumulative number of marriage
applications in 2020 with that of the same period in 2019 in the
Seattle metropolitan area. Figure 4 presents the results. Even
slightly before the governor’s stay-at-home order, marriage
applications in the Seattle area began to fall relative to the preceding year (Figure 4, left panel). The deficit increased following this order; as of September 30, there were 3,060 fewer
marriage applications than in the preceding year, which represents a 15 percent decrease in marriage applications (Figure 4,
right panel). Although the gap between marriage applications
in 2020 and 2019 continues to widen, it appears that the rate at
which it is increasing has slowed in recent months, at least
compared with the period of the early pandemic.

An increase possibly attributable to an anticipatory response
to coronavirus closures, the availability of numerically interesting wedding dates (e.g., 2/20/20), the presence of a leap day, or
Valentine’s Day falling on Friday rather than Thursday.

The decrease in marriage applications we observe in
Seattle (15 percent) is noticeably smaller than the decreases
in marriage licenses we observe in other contexts. This
smaller gap might suggest that marriages in other locations
are likely to bounce back soon, albeit to levels slightly lower
than prepandemic levels. However, the deficit in the year-todate cumulative number of marriage applications relative to
the same period in 2019 in the Seattle area also continues to
increase, suggesting that the relatively smaller decline in
marriage applications is unlikely to be a harbinger of imminent returns to observed 2019 marriage levels. It is, however,
worth noting that the deficit is smaller for marriage applications than for marriage licenses. This finding suggests that
not only are fewer couples seeking to marry (i.e., applying
for a marriage license), fewer couples are marrying even
after they get their licenses. Furthermore, the magnitude of
the marriage deficit in King County, which has the largest
population in the MSA, was 33 percent, which is in line with
the deficits observed in Florida, Hawaii, and DFW.

Conclusions
The COVID-19 pandemic and policies to curb the spread of
the virus have profoundly affected society. This article contributes to this emerging body of research a description of
short-term marriage pattern changes following the onset of
COVID-19. We find that fewer people are marrying in 2020
than in 2019. Observing this pattern in a variety of different
settings, including a state with a limited governmental intervention (Florida), a geographically isolated state that took
strong quarantine measures (Hawaii), and a large metropolitan
area (DFW), suggests that this may be a common experience
across the United States. Furthermore, we find a persistent
deficit in marriage applications in a metropolitan area six
months after the first outbreaks were noted. Taken together,
our results indicate a steep decline in marriage formation in
the United States following the outbreak of the COVID-19
pandemic. This decline has thus far shown few signs of stopping, or even slowing, and leading indicators are consistent
with continued declines relative to prepandemic levels.
The magnitude of the decline is too big to attribute solely
to the temporary shock in the availability of marriage certification (i.e., closed governmental offices). Many local governments, including those included in this sample, continued
to process marriage application throughout the pandemic.
For example, in one large county in the Dallas MSA, Tarrant
County (with a 2019 population of 2.1 million), marriage
applications were processed every business day throughout
the governor’s emergency declaration. Even in areas with
more restrictive government mandates (e.g., shelter-in-place
orders), restrictions have been limited in duration, resulting
in relatively minor restrictions to access in governmental services like marriage licensing.
This gap is also not solely attributable to unprocessed marriage licenses. Lags between marriages and our data collection are sufficient to minimize this threat. For marriages in the

Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World ﻿
DFW area, the delay between August 2020 marriages and our
data collection is consistent with less than 2.5 percent undercounted marriages on the basis of the previous year’s processing timelines (Supplemental Figure 2). The actual undercount
is likely even smaller because prior months are even more
complete and administrative processing appears to be faster
in 2020 than it was in 2019 (Supplemental Table 1), possibly because of reduced caseload. Counts of marriages in
Florida are also unlikely to be dramatic undercounts.
Comparing June 2020 marriages on the basis of provisional
reports collected in September and October, only 21 (0.2 percent) additional marriages were added to the count of the latter, suggesting a stability of the count as we would expect
given few unreported marriages. Finally, the decline in marriage applications we observe in Seattle suggests that the difference in marriages we observe between 2020 and 2019 is
likely due, at least in part, to fewer couples’ seeking to marry.
Although marriages have declined in the aggregate, this
outcome could have arisen from two distinct mechanisms
that we are unable to differentiate. Many couples may have
simply postponed marriages because of COVID-19-induced
barriers to marriages, including inaccessible public services
(such as county clerk offices), shuttered facilities (such as
churches), travel restrictions, and the like. For others, the
experience of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in foregone marriages. Researchers have documented that social
shocks can produce declines in births, only some of which
are recouped after postponement (Currie and Schwandt
2014), but whether such a process occurs in the context of
marriage remains an open question. The extent to which
delayed marriages represent a temporary delay or foregone
unions will likely depend on the strength of the relationships,
the duration of the pandemic, mortality rates among young
adults, and other social factors, including the size of the economic fallout from COVID-19. As an institution, marriage
has important implications for the well-being and health of
couples and their offspring (McLanahan and Jacobsen 2015),
individual behaviors (e.g., Wagner 2019), and legal protections for partners. Therefore, understanding the impact of
COVID-19 on marriage formation not only showcases how
the pandemic has, even if temporarily, upended key dimensions of our social life, it also highlights a wide array of
potential effects of COVID-19 on adults and children. We
recommend that future research with more long-term data
address the extent to which these missing marriages have
been delayed rather than foregone and identify the mechanisms contributing to this effect, irrespective of its duration.
Although the tenor of the findings is unmistakable, we
should be clear about their implications. First, though we
document a decline in the number of marriages following
COVID-19, this analysis should not be taken to mean that the
pandemic has upended marriage as a social institution. Our
research offers the first view of how the year-to-date cumulative number of marriage transitions has changed over a short
period of time. The preference for marriage among Americans
been historically robust (Cherlin 2009), so future research

Wagner et al.
would be necessary to explore whether the COVID-19 pandemic may have shifted the desirability, content, or meaning
of marriages for those who experience them. Second, the
counts of marriages we report are indicative of marriage
trends but may differ slightly from final counts of marriages
in these locations. As discussed above, these data are unlikely
to change substantially, but early-access administrative data
are inherently provisional and subject to subsequent revisions. Third, although our data cover approximately 10.4
percent of the United States population, we should be cautious in generalizing the observed decrease in marriage,
because U.S. jurisdictions have varied widely in terms of
pandemic experience (CDC COVID-19 Response Team
2020) and government response (Hale et al. 2020). We are
also unable to disentangle the possible causes for the
observed decrease in marriage. The COVID-19 pandemic
has included covarying experiences: health, policy, economic, and social. In this article, we demonstrate the decrease
in marriages following the outbreak of COVID-19, but future
work should seek to explain the cause for the observed
declines. Finally, this article represents only a first description of the short-term impacts of COVID-19 on marriage in
the United States. Future work should seek to extend this
description, not only geographically but further in time as the
pandemic, and its response, continues to unfold.
Nonetheless, our study offers a first glimpse at the dramatic decline in the number of marriages in a variety of different settings across the United States, with varying
experiences and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. It
also contributes insights to our understanding of the impact
COVID-19 has had on social life. Although it is unclear
whether this decline will represent a temporary delay in marriage timing or an exacerbation of the long-term trend in
marriage decline, what is clear is that marriage, like many
other dimensions of our social life, has been dramatically
influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic.
