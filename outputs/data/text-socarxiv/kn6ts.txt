"3" "Abstract"
"4" "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination discussions in Bangladesh have exposed concerns and revealed challenges that must be overcome for the successful implementation of the COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. Vaccine prices, misinformation, and trust are expected to be major potential barriers to achieving the necessary vaccination rates to combat the ongoing coronavirus outbreak in Bangladesh. In this commentary, we explore the roles played by vaccine prices and public health risk communications in achieving an inclusive vaccination strategy against COVID-19, especially among the country’s low-income population."

"6" "1.  Concerns  and  Challenges"
"7" "Widespread vaccination at this stage in the pandemic is believed to be critical not only for controlling the transmission, infection, and consequent death risks associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at the community-level, but also for achieving herd immunity. Although the recent development of multiple vaccines has raised widespread hope for an effective pandemic response strategy, vaccine costs and misinformation are emerging as major challenges  [1]  to the successful implementation of vaccination programs worldwide. However, vaccination remains necessary to minimize COVID-19 infections and deaths  [2,3] , especially in countries such as Bangladesh  [4] . Misinformation and superstitions regarding the potential health hazards posed by vaccination can affect public trust and willingness to accept vaccines  [5] . These factors can lead to unexpectedly low vaccination rates, with serious public health implications, underscoring the importance of prioritizing the management and distribution of vaccines for countries  similar to  Bangladesh."
"8" "The Bangladesh government initiated the public vaccination program on 27 January 2021, with priority for first responders, including physicians, nurses, and government officials, among others. Interested individuals must register through a designated website to receive the vaccination, which is likely to be inconvenient for individuals who do not use the internet, especially older  individuals  and rural populations. Although the government-initiated vaccination program is currently available free-of-charge for these priority groups, the provision of free vaccination for the general population, especially the country’s low-income and marginalized populations, remains uncertain. In addition, whether the general population will have timely access to vaccines remains unclear due to the current high global demand for vaccines. Both the government and private companies in Bangladesh have established plans to procure vaccines from various sources; however, Bangladesh has only secured 7 million doses  [6] , which is considerably fewer than the number required to vaccinate the country’s 180 million people. Moreover, the specialized storage and distribution systems necessary for some of the developed vaccines remain pressing concerns."
"9" "These concerns have been apparent in recent studies, such as the study reporting that only 32% of the surveyed individuals were willing to receive the available vaccine  [4] . Unfortunately, 55% and 34% of respondents, respectively, questioned the efficacy of the vaccine and expressed concerns regarding  potential side effects. Although the exact sources of this mistrust remain unclear, numerous anti-vaccine movements and wide speculation have appeared on social networking channels, which might influence people’s opinions. Stories being circulating by the international media regarding potential side effects may also contribute to the formation of negative mindsets and the reluctance to be vaccinated.  Boom Bangladesh, a third-party fact-checking partner for Facebook, has flagged approximately 1 million posts associated with the spread of misinformation on Facebook in January 2021 alone  [7] .  Previous studies have reported the widespread unwillingness among low-income individuals to become vaccinated in Bangladesh  [8–10] . One primary reason for this unwillingness was associated with the potential for additional health costs associated with consequent side-effects. In addition, a low COVID-19-associated mortality rate in Bangladesh  [11]  and the low rate of infection among rural populations may also serve as motivating factors that drive the observed unwillingness to receive vaccines. The existence of rural-urban, income, and gender gaps have been reported for participation in vaccination programs in Bangladesh [8]."
"10" "2.  Policy Implications"
"11" "Thus, the government implementation of a county-wide vaccination program in Bangladesh must consider the implementation of two important policy measures. First, vaccines should be either free of costs or the government should fix prices to ensure affordability among the country’s low-income communities, who have been enduring the loss of employment and income associated with coronavirus pandemic policies. The online registration process should be user-friendly, and those who might not have access to internet-based registration must be included through other viable means. Heath assistance and soft loans from various external sources can and should be explored to fund vaccination programs. Second, a well-coordinated and comprehensive public health communication strategy is extremely important for the success of an all-inclusive vaccination program to prevent and control the pandemic in Bangladesh. The government agencies involved in the public health sector can play vital roles in restoring the people’s confidence in the vaccination program. Mass print, electronic information, social media monitoring  [12] , and campaigns that support and promote vaccination should be established, involving influential public and private entities, such as the country’s vast developmental networks, to nurture both positive  awareness and trust  [13]   regarding the efficacy and safety of vaccines. Evidence regarding the successful implementation of vaccination programs by other countries could facilitate this effort. Thus, designing and developing a successful public health risk communication strategy and action plan  [14,15] , in addition to gathering additional evidence-based research regarding attitudes towards vaccines, are urgently necessary to promote the success of a countrywide vaccination program against COVID-19."
