Summary

2

The world made remarkable progress in reducing extreme poverty over the last twenty years. Recent

3

progress has slowed,1 however, and the economic damage wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic1–3

4

imperils progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of eradicating extreme

5

poverty and alleviating inequality by the year 2030. To track progress towards the SDGs, we collated—to

6

the best of our knowledge—the largest collection of poverty and inequality related data and developed

7

novel methods to construct comprehensive and comparable estimates of poverty and inequality from

8

1980 to 2019 in 204 countries and territories, across urban and rural settings, and by age; further, we

9

forecast the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on poverty out to 2021. We find that over the past four

10

decades, the number of individuals living in extreme poverty declined dramatically, however, extreme

11

poverty counts were rising in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) era

12

corresponded to the fastest observed reduction in extreme poverty and a period of more equitable

13

growth. Progress made is jeopardized by the economic shock resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.

14

Estimates of poverty through 2021 highlight the effect of the global economic shock, the effect of

15

governments’ economic responses to the pandemic, and the need to build economies resilient to the

16

next global threat.

Main

18

The 2015 United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aspired to set a global course for peace

19

and prosperity of all people and the planet by 20304. The aims of the SDGs are enshrined in a set of 17

20

global goals that call for all signatory countries to realize their common responsibility in achieving a

21

safer, more just, and sustainable world5. Progress on any one of the 17 SDGs does not occur in isolation

22

as evidence suggests the SDGs are interconnected and progress on one goal may have spillover effects

23

on progress on other goals6. Two goals that have the greatest positive spillover effects are the

24

eradication of extreme poverty and alleviation of inequality7–10.

25

In 2000, the precursors to the SDGs, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set a target to

26

cut in half the proportion of the world’s population living in extreme poverty by 2015; the goal was

27

achieved five years ahead of schedule11. Momentum from this achievement may not have been

28

sustained1, and the economic damage due to COVID-19 interventions may place the SDG goal of

29

eradicating extreme poverty further out of reach1.

30

Despite their global significance, efforts to measure progress on poverty eradication and

31

alleviation of inequality remain imperfect. Existing global estimates of poverty and inequality are often

32

made with limited data and rely on regional averages for imputation1, and in many cases the underlying

33

data used in estimation lacks comparability, limiting cross country comparisons12,13. To address these

34

concerns, we amassed the largest collection of poverty and inequality related data, developed a novel

35

procedure to standardize the data, and implemented a nonparametric estimation process to measure

36

extreme poverty and inequality in 204 countries and territories between 1980 and 2019 in both urban

37

and rural settings by age. Further, we assess the profound economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic

38

on poverty and the effect of government responses to the pandemic.

Tracking absolute and relative poverty from 1980 to 2019

41

$1.90 a day per person in 2011 purchasing power parity-adjusted (PPP) dollars14 – a unit of

42

measurement which adjusts for variations in the price of goods and services across countries and time.

43

We estimated the total number of individuals living in extreme poverty decreased by over 1.3 billion

44

from 1980 to 2019 (Fig 1C). The global decline in extreme poverty was driven especially by progress over

45

the past forty years in China and India, where the number of individuals living in extreme poverty was

46

reduced by approximately 850 and 350 million, respectively. The pace of this global decline slowed since

47

2009, however, due primarily to growing extreme poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa.

48

The SDGs define extreme poverty as the number of individuals living in households spending less than

The extreme poverty rate—or the percentage of the population living in extreme poverty—

49

declined from almost 45% in 1980 to 8.3% (UI 7.6-8.9%) in 2019 (Fig 1B). Globally, urban poverty rates

50

were lower than rural poverty rates in all years of this study, but the gap between the two shrunk

51

dramatically, especially between 1990 and 2010 when the global rural poverty rate fell sharply.

52

Approximately 25% of individuals living in extreme poverty lived in urban settings in 2019—an increase

53

from 15% in 1980.

54

The eradication of extreme poverty is defined as an extreme poverty rate of less than 3%15. In

55

2019, 121 out of 204 countries eradicated extreme poverty—an increase of 46 countries since 1980.

56

Extreme poverty was concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa: 32 of the 35 countries with extreme poverty

57

rates above 25% were within Sub-Saharan Africa in 2019 (Fig. 1C). Burundi, Central African Republic, The

58

Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Somalia were the only countries with extreme poverty rates

59

exceeding 60% in 2019 (Fig 1C). Nigeria and India were the only countries with over 75 million

60

individuals living in extreme poverty in 2019.

61

The extreme poverty line of $1.90 a day becomes less relevant as countries grow economically

62

and the vast majority of populations move out of extreme poverty. Instead, the relative poverty rate

63

becomes an increasingly valuable measure as it quantifies both country-specific poverty and serves as a
4

64

measure of inequality. The relative poverty rate is defined as the proportion of individuals living on less

65

than 50% of the median standard of living (the value of all goods and services consumed)14. Because the

66

median standard of living varies across countries and changes over time, the relative poverty line is

67

country and year specific measure. The SDGs use relative poverty to measure progress towards

68

alleviation of inequality (SDG 10.2.1). Between 1980 and 2019, the number of countries with a relative

69

poverty rate exceeding 20% declined from 31 to seven. Six of the seven countries were in sub-Saharan

70

Africa (Fig 1D).

71
72

Demography and poverty

73

population growing by over three billion16. As the population grew, two other important demographic

74

changes occurred: (1) the world became more urban as the fraction of the world’s population living in

75

urban areas expanded from 40% to 55%17, and (2) the world’s population aged, with the median age of

76

the population growing by over ten years17. In 1980, the shape of both the urban and rural population

77

distributions followed a pyramid shape (Fig 2). By 2019, the population distribution in urban settings

78

grew more stationary while the rural population distribution maintained a pyramid shape (Fig 2). The

79

change in urban population distribution was driven by individuals making more than $11 a day—a result

80

largely due to China’s changing demographics (Extended Data Fig 1) and rising economic prosperity

81

(Extended Data Fig 2). In 2019, nearly 4.3 billion individuals (55% of the world’s population) lived on

82

more than $11 a day—an increase of almost three billion since 1980; of these individuals, 70% lived in

83

urban settings, 45% were between the ages of 15 and 45, 37% lived in China or India, and 50% lived in

84

Asia more broadly.

The number of individuals living in extreme poverty fell over the past forty years despite the global

85

From 1980 to 2019, the number of children under the age of 15 living in extreme poverty fell

86

from approximately 890 million to 225 million, but still accounted for 40% of the population living in

87

extreme poverty in 2019 (Fig 2). We estimate it would cost over USD2021 51 billion annually to lift every

5

88

child under the age of 15 out of extreme poverty and USD2021 98 billion to lift every individual out of

89

extreme poverty in 2019.

90
91

The pace and pattern of growth

92

faster than that of the wealthiest—though the pattern of growth in the standard of living was not

93

constant over time (Fig 3A). From 1980 to 2000, the growth in the standard of living followed the

94

classical S shape pattern—popularly likened to the silhouette of an elephant18–20—where the growth in

95

the standard of living of the poorest 50% and wealthiest 10% outpaced those in the middle (50-90th

96

percentiles). By removing the contributions of China and India to the global pattern, the standard of

97

living of the poorest three quarters of the world declined from 1980 to 2000, while the standard of living

98

of the wealthiest grew (Extended Data Fig 3). Conversely, during the MDGs (2000-2015) and the SDGs

99

(2016-2019), growth in standard of living of the poorest 50% far outpaced the growth in the standard of

Over the last four decades, the world grew more equal as the standard of living of the poorest grew

100

living of the wealthiest (with or without the contributions of China and India, Extended Data Fig 3), a

101

critical condition for dramatically reducing global inequality. Despite this relative success, the absolute

102

standard of living of the poorest three quarters of the global population grew by less than $1,000 a year;

103

in contrast, the standard of living of the wealthiest grew by over $7,000 a year (Extended Data Fig 3).

104

Countries also grew more equitably, on average, over the last 40 years (Fig 3B). From 1980 to

105

2000, within country inequality grew as the standard of living of the wealthiest increased slightly faster

106

than the poor; but during the MDGs, the pattern reversed, as countries grew more equally (Fig 3B). This

107

pattern of growth persisted during the first four years of the SDGs, however, the magnitude of

108

annualized growth in the standard of living across all percentiles during the MDGs was almost twice as

109

large as growth during the SDGs (Fig 3B). These conclusions remain robust even after adjusting for

110

unaccounted consumption that arises due to difficulty in surveying the very wealthiest (see

111

Supplemental Materials).

6

112
113

Inclusive growth

114

calls for countries to both grow economically and reduce inequality by promoting inclusive growth14.

115

Inclusive growth is achieved when there is both growth in the mean standard of living and a positive

116

shared prosperity premium, which is the difference between the growth rate of the mean standard of

117

living of the poorest 40% and the growth rate of the mean standard of living1. A positive shared

118

prosperity premium can either indicate that growth in the poor’s standard of living advances faster

119

while the mean standard of living is growing, or during times of declining mean standard of living, that

120

changes in the poor’s standard of living remain protected.

To build more equitable, resilient, and cohesive societies that protect the most vulnerable, SDG 10.1.1

121

Our analysis indicated that 149 out of 204 countries grew inclusively during the MDG era—three

122

times the number of countries that grew inclusively from 1980 to 2000 (44 countries; Extended Data Fig

123

4). We estimate countries’ failure to grow inclusively from 1980 to 2000 prevented approximately 210

124

million individuals from escaping extreme poverty. In comparison, inclusive growth during the MDGs

125

lifted over 150 million individuals from extreme poverty. Despite the success of the MDGs, the number

126

of countries that grew inclusively during the first four years of the SDGs declined slightly to 124 and the

127

magnitude of the shared prosperity premium also receded (Extended Data Fig 4).

128
129

Estimating the effect of COVID-19 on poverty

130

human and economic toll of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown and ongoing. We estimate the

131

economic fallout in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic pushed approximately 47 million into extreme

132

poverty and 103 million into relative poverty in 2020, compared to a scenario where economic trends

133

preceding COVID-19 persisted (Fig 4). Governments responded quickly by providing $12 trillion in

134

economic assistance during the first eight months of the pandemic,21 and we estimate these funds

135

prevented approximately 24 million from entering into extreme poverty and 91 million from entering

136

into relative poverty in 2020. Our estimates suggest the failure to extend government assistance into

The world and its economic systems were shocked by the COVID-19 pandemic in 20203,21. The exact

7

137

2021—at a proportional level to the assistance disbursed in 2020—would result in nearly 23 million

138

individuals falling into extreme poverty and 72 million individuals falling into relative poverty in 2021.

139

Finally, if countries had matched their MDG shared prosperity premium during the SDGs (2005-2021),

140

the need for government assistance during the pandemic would have been substantially mitigated: in

141

2020, the continuation of MDG level of inclusive growth would have prevented almost 33 million cases

142

of relative poverty and 14 million cases of extreme poverty—approximately 60% of the cases of extreme

143

poverty prevented by governments’ economic mitigation measures (Fig 4).

144
145

Discussion

146

billion and the number of children under the age of 15 living in extreme poverty declined by 625 million.

147

Still, in 2019, there were over 630 million living on less than $1.90 a day—approximately 40% of whom

148

were children under the age of 15. The past four decades also led to more equitable growth in the

149

standard of living, globally and within countries. The progress made to reduce extreme poverty

150

correlates with progress made on broader measures of development22,23 like reduction in child

151

mortality24,25, increased educational attainment26, political inclusion27, and expanded freedoms and

152

agency27. The progress made on achieving a more equitable world and equitable societies is slightly

153

counter to the conclusion of other analyses20,28—potentially due to our focus on measuring the standard

154

of living, as opposed to income.

Over the last four decades, the number of individuals living in extreme poverty declined by over 1.3

155

Starting in 2000, the MDGs set out to advance the standard of living of the poorest and most

156

vulnerable through unprecedented global cooperation and investment to expand access to education

157

and healthcare, reduce poverty, and alleviate inequality. During this time, we found almost three

158

quarters of countries grew inclusively and extreme poverty reduced three times faster than either the

159

preceding 20 years or the first four years of the SDGs. The failure to extend the level of MDG era

160

inclusive growth into the first four years of the SDGs left millions more individuals vulnerable to the

8

161

economic damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the pandemic, many governments

162

around the world quickly provided $12 trillion in economic relief,21 and these funds helped to mitigate

163

approximately 50% of the total cases of extreme poverty and 90% of the cases of relative poverty that

164

can be attributed to the pandemic in 2020.

165

Governments have quickly responded economically to the pandemic but the responses has been

166

uneven. While the average decline in GDP per capita in low- and middle income countries (LMICs) were

167

similar to GDP per capita declines in high-income countries in 2020 (approximately 7% decline)2, the

168

average government response to the economic fallout in high-income countries was nearly three times

169

larger than the response in LMICs—measured as government spending as a percentage of GDP (14% vs

170

5% of GDP)21. Hitherto, high-income countries have taken advantage of generous financial conditions to

171

fund government responses and prevent catastrophic economic scaring21. In contrast, LMICs are

172

financially constrained due to lack of access to financial markets, high borrowing costs, and worrisome

173

levels of debt,3,21 with over half of low-income countries in debt distress or at high-risk of distress21.

174

These financial constraints limit LMICs from mounting a proportional health response and preventing

175

cracks in economic foundations necessary for jumpstarting a recovery3. A lackluster response and

176

recovery only increases the odds of setting off a debt crisis, further imperiling the poor and jeopardizing

177

the global containment of an ever mutating, contagious virus29 in an interconnected world.

178

To date, the financial assistance provided to countries lacks in size, scope, and maybe

179

creativity.30–32 Many LMICs will need more assistance in the form of grants, loans, and debt servicing

180

relief to address their acute and unique challenges33 and prevent impending economic calamity.30

181

Fortunately, a growing chorus of leaders with power are planning “to go big”34 and substantially

182

enhance fiscal support for the most financially vulnerable countries. Post-pandemic, this mindset will

183

likely need to be carried over to avoid a long plodding recovery. A sustained and vigorous financial

184

commitment will help LMICs make investments3,21 that recover the quarter of a billion jobs lost in the

9

185

pandemic—which largely supported the working poor35—and reclaim the pandemic-induced learning

186

losses that are projected to cost future generations upwards of USD 10 trillion.36 At this precarious

187

moment, making significant investments now can help LMICs take advantage of their favorable

188

demographics and spur a new era of inclusive growth3,21,37,38 rivaling the MDGs and deliver on the goal to

189

eradicate extreme poverty, alleviate inequality, and achieve sustainable development7–10 that gives rise

190

to more cohesive and resilient societies prepared to weather future shocks—whether they be in the

191

form of economic crisis, conflict, political instability, another pandemic, or a warming world.

192

193

Methods

194

Data

195

We used household surveys detailing either the value of income received by households or consumed

196

goods and services (exclusive of publicly provided education and healthcare services). Note, in this

197

analysis we use the term consumption and standard of living interchangeably. Consumption and income

198

measures are two distinct concepts. Cross-country analyses of poverty often note this distinction but

199

make no adjustment and pool these data together13. In contrast, we standardised all data to be

200

reflective of consumption by developing an income-to-consumption adjustment process using a boosted

201

regression tree (see supplementary information). Consumption was our preferred measure as it directly

202

reflects material wellbeing; measures of income are poorly predictive of material wellbeing in informal

203

or subsistence-based economies. Further details of the adjustment process may be found in the

204

methods annex.

205

The underlying data that fed our analysis was from the World Bank PovCalNet39, the United

206

Nations-World Institute for Development Economics (UN-WIDER)40, Luxembourg Income Study (LIS)41,

207

and Gallup World Poll surveys42. For select data sources we did not have access to underlying microdata,

208

only tabulation. We interpolated and standardized reported tabulations, see methods annex for details.

209

Tabulated data were often only presented at the national level which limited our ability to use these

210

data to estimate poverty and inequality at more granular levels (e.g. by age and urban/rural). This

211

limitation required us to develop a modeling procedure that made estimates at various levels of

212

granularity that were then scaled to the national level. In total, our data covered 179 country-years and

213

150 countries within the past five years.

214

Modeling

215

Since not all data were available at the most granular level of analysis (e.g. urban/rural-age group level),

216

we made estimates at four levels that were reflective of the data availability. These modeling levels
11

217

were the (i) national level, (ii) the urban and rural, (iii) urban and rural aggregated age group levels, and

218

(iv) urban and rural granular age group levels. Aggregated age groups corresponded to 0-14, 15-19, 20-

219

24… 60-64, and 65 years of age or older; granular age groups corresponded to 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-20, …

220

60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, and 80 years of age or older. Age groups and urban and rural designations

221

were determined by the underlining survey data.

222

For each of the four modeling levels, we grouped the data by age group-urban/rural level (or the

223

lowest level of granularity possible) and calculated two measures from each group: the mean

224

consumption and the consumption Lorenz curve, respectively denoted by 𝜇 and 𝐿(𝑝). The mean

225

consumption reflects the average value of all goods and services consumed. The consumption Lorenz

226

curve reflects the cumulative share of total consumption against the respective cumulative population

227

percentiles. Together, mean consumption, 𝜇, and the consumption Lorenz curve, 𝐿(𝑝), can be used to

228

calculate the cumulative distribution of consumption, 𝐹(𝑥), by the following mathematical relationship

229

𝐹 −1 (𝑥) = 𝜇 ∗ 𝐿(𝑝)′ (1)

230

𝐹(𝑥) is a smooth monotonically increasing function that reflects the percentage of the population living

231

under specific thresholds denoted by 𝑥—or the poverty rate at 𝑥. Inversely, 𝐹 −1 (𝑥) provides the level of

232

consumption at population percentile 𝑥.

233

We estimated the mean consumption and consumption Lorenz curve at all four modeling levels

234

in 204 countries from 1980 to 2021. In total, we estimated 14 models: the mean consumption and

235

consumption Lorenz curve each estimated at the national level (1), urban level (2), rural level (3), urban

236

aggregated age groups (4), rural aggregated age group (5), urban granular age groups (6), rural granular

237

age groups (7).

238
239

We developed a novel two-step modeling procedure and applied it to estimate both the Lorenz
curve and mean consumption model. In the first step of the modeling framework, we used a within12

240

between model to regress mean consumption—or in the case of the consumption Lorenz curve,

241

cumulative share of total consumption at a given percentile—against a set of predictive covariates that

242

include GDP per capita, log percentage of the population with 12 years of education, log prevalence of

243

wasting, log natural resource exports as a percentage of GDP, log fraction of government expenditure

244

over GDP, log fraction of consumption over GDP, and a measure of universal health coverage. These

245

covariates were included on the basis of theoretical relationship, historical precedence, and statistical

246

significance and were sourced from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study24,43,44. In the case of the

247

Lorenz curve, covariate effects were allowed to vary across population percentiles. Further details on

248

covariate selection and estimation process may be found in the supplementary information The within-

249

between model was useful in our application as the model was capable of explaining within country

250

variation—accounting for unobserved time-invariant country factors—and between country variation—

251

useful in making predictions in countries where we had no survey data.

252

The within-between model may not have accounted for all measureable heterogeneity across

253

time and within country or region. To help account for this heterogeneity, we smoothed the residuals

254

from the within-between model over time in a series of cascading Gaussian Process Regressions

255

(GPRs)45. In the case of the Lorenz curve, we smoothed over population percentiles in addition to time;

256

in the case of models by age group, we additionally smoothed over age to benefit from the correlated

257

age patterns. The GPR cascade flowed down a modeling cascade defined by the GBD geographical

258

hierarchy. This modeling framework is similar to other modeling frameworks used to estimate globally

259

relevant health and financial statistics43,44. A more complete description of the modeling framework is

260

available in the supplementary information.

261

After estimation, we used our estimates of mean consumption, consumption Lorenz curve, and

262

equation 1, to calculate seven cumulative consumption distributions (national, urban, rural, urban-age

263

aggregated, rural-age aggregated, urban-age group, rural age-group). However, due to the independent
13

264

nature of the modeling, these cumulative consumption distributions may not be internally consistent

265

across all modeling levels. We ensured internal consistency through a process of sequential scaling of all

266

estimates to the national level estimates, as the national level estimates were supported by more data.

267

Uncertainty was propagated fully throughout the modeling process. The supplementary information

268

provides more details on these processes.

269

Forecasting

270

We forecasted the cumulative distribution of consumption in a panel regression model to predict

271

poverty rates in 2020 and 2021. By modeling the cumulative distribution of consumption as the

272

dependent variable, we account for both the magnitude of changes in consumption as well as the

273

distribution of consumption. The panel model regressed estimates of the cumulative distribution of

274

consumption at 99 percentiles (1st-99th) against the population percentiles, GDP per capita, and general

275

government expenditure as a fraction of GDP (GGE) and the interaction between population percentiles

276

and GDP per capita and GGE. Since our dependent variable was estimated, we inversed variance

277

weighted the data to give more weight to estimates with greater certainty.

278

We developed a total of four forecast scenarios: (1) a scenario without COVID-19, (2) a scenario

279

with COVID-19 without government intervention, (3) a scenario with COVID-19 but with government

280

intervention, (4) and a scenario with COVID-19 that includes no government response but countries at

281

least matched their MDG shared prosperity premium from 2016 to 2021.

282

For scenario 1, we used previously published forecast of GDP and GGE that neglect all impacts

283

from COVID-1946. For scenario 2, we used forecast of GDP out to the year 2021 that account for the

284

economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic2; for GGE forecast to the year 2021, we used model

285

predictions form a regressing GGE against GDP forecast sensitive to COVID-19. For scenario 3, we used

14

286

scenario 2’s forecast of GDP and GGE but we added to the GGE forecast “above the line” government

287

spending that was provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic21.

288

For scenario 4, we used predictions from scenario 2, however, we forced each country’s

289

cumulative distributions of consumption to at least match their MDG shared prosperity premium. We

290

achieved this by first calculating each country’s shared prosperity premium during the MDGs by

291

differencing countries’ annualized change in mean consumption of the poorest 40% and the annualized

292

change in overall mean standard of living. Secondly, from 2015 to 2021, we calculated countries’ shared

293

prosperity premium for each year. If, for a given country-year between 2015 and 2021, the calculated

294

shared prosperity premium was less than the country’s shared prosperity premium during the MDGs, we

295

inflated consumption levels of the bottom 40% to match the country’s MDG shared prosperity premium

296

level.

Reported statistics

299

Project17 estimates of the proportion of the population living in urban and rural areas by age16,17.

300

Estimates of the relative poverty rate were made using country-specific poverty thresholds defined as

301

50% of the median consumption of the population. Relative poverty estimates for 2020 and 2021 were

302

calculated using 2019 country-specific poverty thresholds, per recommendations for reporting relative

303

poverty rates during times of extreme economic volatility48.

304

All reported poverty counts were made using published population estimates47 and UN Urbanization

Our estimates of the number of cases of poverty prevented by inclusive growth (or cases of

305

poverty due to the failure to grow inclusively) were estimated similarly to the process described in

306

forecast scenario 4. We first calculated the shared prosperity premium from 1980 to 2000 and the

307

shared prosperity premium during the MDGs. To calculate the number of cases of poverty that could

308

have been prevented by growing inclusively, we took all countries with a negative shared prosperity

309

premium and inflated the consumption of the bottom 40% so the shared prosperity premium equaled
15

310

zero. We then compared poverty rates from the new cumulative distributions of consumption and to

311

the previous poverty rates. To calculate the number of cases of poverty that were due to inclusive

312

growth, we took all countries with a positive shared prosperity premium, deflated consumption levels of

313

the bottom 40% until the shared prosperity premium equaled zero, and recalculated poverty rates from

314

the new cumulative distribution of consumption.

Limitations

317

questionnaire exists to elicit household consumption or income. Inevitably, the lack of uniformity in

318

questionnaires increases the variation of measures reported from surveys and potentially disrupted

319

cross-country comparisons, and within-country trends. In many countries there is often infrequent data

320

collection leading to large gaps in data. We minimized this limitation as much as possible by leveraging

321

the largest collection of poverty and inequality related data. In India, as an example, similar “now

322

casting” exercises of poverty rely on an Indian survey that was taken in 2011 to predict present poverty;

323

in contrast, we leveraged six Indian surveys between 2011 and the present to predict and forecast levels

324

of poverty in India.

325

As with any modeling exercise, our analysis comes with limitations. For example, no uniform

Further, our definition of urban and rural followed administrative definitions, opposed to

326

population density cutoffs. This decision was made because surveys we draw upon most often classify

327

respondents as urban and rural based of the country’s administrative definition. In the estimation

328

process, these heterogeneous definitions or urban and rural are hopefully accounted for by the country

329

level effects used in our regressions. While the estimates of urban and rural poverty may not be

330

perfectly comparable across countries, these administrative definitions may be of more relevance to

331

country-level officials compared to globally defined and imposed definitions of urban and rural.

332

Admittedly, a more significant issue in comparing urban and rural estimates of poverty is the variation in

16

333

price levels. While our data uses World Bank developed urban and rural PPPs for populous countries like

334

India, China, and Indonesia, urban and rural PPPs are not widely available for many countries.

335

Importantly, our measurement of poverty reflected individuals living in households spending

336

less than $1.90 a day. This definition ignores intra-household allocations. Although this is common

337

practice in poverty research, this simply means our measure of poverty is more reflective of the actual

338

household unit than the actual individual. Additionally, we could further improve upon our income-to

339

consumption adjustment process by accounting for attributes of survey instruments used to elicit levels

340

of consumption—instead of our current approach of treating all instruments uniformly. Finally, our

341

forecast of poverty to the year 2021 are heavily reliant on forecasted GDP per capita and the tracking of

342

government responses to the pandemic. Given the unique nature of the pandemic, our forecast model

343

based on historical data likely does not capture all of the effects of the pandemic on poverty. In the

344

future, integrating high-frequency data into the estimation process could facilitate real-time poverty

345

estimation.

Panel A displays global extreme poverty counts—number individuals in households spending less than a $1.90 a day per person-- by
country/region and urban/rural from 1980 to 2019. The darkly shaded areas represent urban areas and the lightly shaded regions represent rural
area. Panel B display global extreme poverty rates—or the percentage of the world’s population living in households spending less than $1.90 a
day per person—over time by urban and rural areas. The dashed lines in Panel B represent 95% uncertainty intervals. Panel C and D respectively
display absolute extreme and relative poverty rate estimates in 2019. Countries that have eradicated extreme poverty—extreme poverty rate of
less than 3%--are colored in grey.

Panel A displays the annualized growth in the standard of living across global standard of living
percentiles in four time periods. Figure was created by simulating the world’s population at 1000th the
scale. A population proportional number of simulants was generated from each country’s cumulative
distribution of consumption; for a given year, all countries simulants were pooled together, ranked from
poorest to wealthiest, and percentile standard of living levels were then calculated. The annualized
change within a percentile is the line displayed in Panel A. Panel B was generated similarly to Panel A,
excepts simulants were not pooled across countries. Instead, annualized changes across time in the
standard of living for each percentile were calculated within a specific country, and then we averaged
the annualized change across countries for each percentile.
