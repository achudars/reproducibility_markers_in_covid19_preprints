Lancashire Case Study

Map of percentage change in crime.
Bizarro World?
Nationally, small area (LSOAs) were ranked by recorded crime rate and grouped into deciles. Decile
rates are changes relative to the rate expected based on the previous five years.
Key findings:
 Previously high-crime areas saw the largest crime declines.
 Previously-low-crime rate areas experienced crime increases.
 Urban centres saw the greatest crime drops in absolute (but not necessarily relative) terms.
 Public order crime increases likely reflect breaches - or perceived breaches - of lockdown rules.
Some crime increases, including drugs and weapon offences, may reflect changes in police activity.
