Abstract
Much attention has been paid to the care workforce and care home residents during the COVID-19 crisis,
whereas the impact on informal caregivers has remained speculative. In Austria, like in other European
countries, informal care is carried out overwhelmingly by (non-cohabiting) relatives. Limited care
services available during the crisis, social-distancing, economic uncertainty and competing care needs
within households may have changed the profile of informal caregiving and/or increased the
psychological strain experienced by caregivers. Focusing on Austria, this study aims to empirically
analyse the following research questions: how has the pandemic affected the incidence and intensity of
informal caregiving? How has the psychological wellbeing during the first wave of the pandemic
compared across different groups of informal caregivers, depending on their gender and parental status?
We use a novel representative survey carried out in Austria after the implementation of lockdown
measures (June 2020, N=2000). Bivariate and multivariate statistical analysis is applied to a set of survey
items dedicated to respondent’s informal caregiving before and after the start of the pandemic and
psychological wellbeing. Findings suggest a tightening of care networks, with new carers likely to have
stepped in to provide low intensity care to relatively autonomous people. Overall, both prevalence and
intensity of informal care did not change significantly (compared to pre-crisis levels). Caregiving was
associated with poor psychological outcomes, especially among those without children. Findings are
discussed in relation to the emerging literature on the impact of the pandemic and to the policy measures
implemented in Austria.

Introduction
At the onset of the pandemic, many countries failed to acknowledge the importance of the long-term
care (LTC) sector to protect older people in need of care, who were particularly at risk of infection and
mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 (Comas-Herrera et al. 2020; Lorenz-Dant 2020). Early international
figures show that around half of all deaths from COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic
occurred among older people residing in care homes (Comas-Herrera et al. 2020). Only gradually has
awareness increased of the underfunding and fragmentation of many national LTC systems and their
effects on the outcomes of the pandemic (WHO 2020). But while the limelight has been firmly set on
the LTC sector, in particular care homes, informal carers have received comparatively less attention.
Informal carers providing support to family members in need of LTC shoulder a large bulk of the burden
of care, particularly in familialistic welfare states (Barczyk and Kredler 2019). For example, in Austria,
around one million people provide unpaid care to family members, friends or neighbours, and it is
estimated that more than 40 percent of people in need of care are cared for only by family members
(Nagl-Cupal et al. 2018, Schmidt et al. forthcoming). Moreover, informal care is unequally distributed,
i.e., much more prevalent and more intense among women and people in lower socio-economic groups
across Europe (Rodrigues et al. 2017). There are strong indications that informal carers may have been
particularly vulnerable to the consequences of the pandemic, even if not necessarily to the effects of the
virus itself (Lorenz-Dant 2020). The gender and socio-economic status of informal carers may have
placed them in a vulnerable situation, for example, as a result of job loss or kindergarten closings and
home-schooling (Hamel and Salganicoff 2020).
Given the hidden nature of informal care and the pace at which the coronavirus pandemic and its
consequences have spread, there is a dearth of reliable data on the situation of informal carers during
the pandemic. What information exists is not fully available for all countries yet or is limited to results
from convenience sample surveys. Taking advantage of unique data from a representative survey of
Austria’s working age population collected during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study
aims to bridge this gap. Specifically, it aims to identify driving factors of informal care during the crisis
in a familialistic country such as Austria. It also aims to provide first-hand insights into the wellbeing
situation of informal caregivers for frail or disabled family members, friends or neighbours during the
first wave of the pandemic. After an empirical overview of the measures implemented in Austria and
existing evidence in the next sections, we move on to describe the data used, methodology and results.
We conclude with a discussion of the main findings in view of vulnerabilities of informal caregivers
highlighted by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and possible policy implications.
The Austrian Experience with COVID-19
The management of the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria involved the early implementation of relatively
stringent measures. Based on the Government Response Stringency Index (Hale et al. 2020), Austria
ranked 9th out of 26 EU countries for which data were available at the outset of the pandemic (data from
8 April 2020)1 but relaxed measures more quickly than others, ranking 14th by mid-June. The country’s
lockdown extended to schools and kindergartens, besides other services such as shops and restaurants
and lasted from mid-March to the beginning of May approximately. Care homes were closed for visitors
during lockdown and re-opened gradually from mid-April onwards, together with announced plans for
a comprehensive screening for all staff and residents in care homes (BMSGPK, 2020). For community
care services however, no federal guidelines were issued. Anecdotal reports show that community care
was reduced to a minimum, e.g. for people in need of care living along (Schmidt et al., 2020). As other
European countries, Austria also sealed its borders in the early stages of the crisis to all but essential
travel. Privately paid live-in domestic assistants of migrant origin were thus either prevented from
returning to their countries or locked out of the country. There is no information available on the

The index covers different domains such as school closures, workplace closures, cancellation of public events,
restrictions on public gatherings, stay-at-home requirements and travel controls.

consequences of this measure in terms of unmet or increased care burdens, but in 2019, a total of 66.000
live-in carers (usually working in tandem for a single cared for person) were legally working in Austria
(BMASGK 2019). Despite the reliance on care provided by family members, specific support measures
targeted at informal carers relied heavily on support from third sector organisations. At federal level, a
counselling telephone hotline was installed and regional governments received federal funding to help
fund alternative sources of LTC provision where informal carers would drop out (Schmidt et al., 2020).
Nonetheless, at the time of the survey, Austria ranked among the countries with the fewest COVID-19
deaths by in this first wave of the pandemic, with 7.8 deaths per 100.000 inhabitants compared to the
EU average of 21.3 deaths per 100.000 inhabitants (Borkovec et al. 2020).
At the time of the survey, Austria had moved towards a less stringent level of controlling the pandemic,
as schools had reopened and care homes were open for visitors again (see Schmidt et al. 2020). However,
the economic effects of the lockdown were already clearly visible and in the second quarter of 2020, the
unemployment rate had risen to 5.7% (from 4.4% in a similar period in 2019) and the number of inactive
working age population had more than doubled (Statistik Austria 2020).
Impact of COVID on informal care
There is some evidence at the international level of an increase in the care intensity for informal carers
that can be directly linked to the pandemic (Lorenz-Dant 2020). A number of countries have reported a
reduction of community services, either in order to protect care recipients from contracting SARS-CoV2, or due to general regulations to close down certain services for the period of the pandemic (c.f. Carers
UK 2020). A qualitative study on informal carers for people with dementia in the UK confirmed that
fear of contagion by professional carers led informal caregivers to increase care hours as formal care
was discontinued (Giebel et al. 2020). In countries with a high reliance on privately paid live-in domestic
assistants – who are mainly migrant carers, such as in Italy, Germany or Austria – the closure of borders
added to the shortage of care alternatives (Schmidt et al. 2020; Lorenz-Dant 2020). Migrant carers are
particularly relevant to older people with higher care needs, e.g. people with dementia, albeit their users
usually herald from higher socio-economic backgrounds (Barbabella et al. 2016, Schmidt 2017).
Concomitantly, informal caregivers reported diminished availability of other family members to provide
care, which has also contributed to an overall increase in time spent caring, as evidence from the UK,
Australia, Norway and Germany suggests (Maccora et al. 2020; Carers UK 2020; Eurocarers 2020;
Rothgang and Wolf-Ostermann 2020). This tightening of caring networks could also arise from
contagion fears and social distancing rules that often mandated older people to limit the number of
persons with whom they have contact, including non-co-residing relatives. According to a survey among
Austrian caregivers of people with dementia, four out of ten caregivers in lower socio-economic groups
reported that they stopped receiving help from other family members, and 20 percent no longer received
help from neighbours (Volkshilfe 2020). The reduced support within informal caregivers’ networks led
to higher intensity of care, and in 16 percent of cases resulted in a reduction of paid work. Sporadic
support from a larger network of family members in carrying out care tasks such as accompanying older
people to medical appointments was reduced during the crisis, resulting in a larger burden for the main
caregivers (Volkshilfe 2020; Maccora et al. 2020).
We posit that reductions in access to or take-up of different forms of care may have resulted in a higher
intensity of informal caregiving in Austria. The impact on the prevalence of informal care is arguably
less straightforward as a result of two counteracting forces at play: tighter caring networkers due to fear
of contagion (i.e. lower prevalence) and replacement of discontinued formal care with informal care (i.e.
higher prevalence).
Conceptual frameworks such as stress process models (e.g., Aneshensel et al. 1995) and social role
theory (e.g., Stephens et al. 2001) put forward a number of factors that associate informal caregiving
with increased stress and adverse psychological wellbeing. Chiefly among these factors or stressors are
2

care intensity and care needs of the person cared for, usually referred to as ‘care burden’ (Schultz and
Sherwood 2008, Buyck et al. 2011). Early studies on COVID-19 seem to confirm worsening wellbeing
as a result of increased burden as carers step in to fill-in care gaps. In Germany, results from an online
survey of informal caregivers showed that health condition worsened for more than half of carers, as did
self-assessed quality of life (Rothgang and Wolf-Ostermann 2020). Similar results were found in the
UK (Carers UK 2020, Carers Trust 2020), in particular among young adult carers, who reported
deteriorating mental health, connectedness and stress. A longitudinal online survey in Austria shows
that caregivers facing problems in organising care (i.e. with higher care burden) were significantly less
satisfied with their lives than other caregivers (Kalleitner 2020). Due to a reduction in available therapies
and rehabilitative services for people in need of care, it may be assumed also that symptoms of people
cared for worsened, possibly increasing the burden for family caregivers further (see Volkshilfe 2020).
Other factors known to adversely affect psychological wellbeing are role conflict and lack of time due
to multiple caring roles, which is particularly relevant for the ‘sandwich generation’ (Stephens et al.
2001, Do et al. 2014). The impact of caregiving as an added stress factor is likely to have been
particularly strong among certain groups, e.g. carers with childcare responsibilities, due to lockdown
measures such as home schooling and the closure of kindergartens. Indeed, early evidence from the US
suggests that parents reported greater stress and poorer mental health due to the pandemic (Hamel and
Salganicoff 2020). An Australian study of dual-earning couples during COVID-19 showed unpaid care
to have gone up, particularly among mothers (Craig and Churchill 2020).
Women and men differ in how they experience stress arising from caregiving. Women are more often
the primary caregiver, are more likely to shoulder other unpaid tasks, and have lower financial resources;
while men more often characterize informal caregiving as a voluntary choice (Pinquart and Sorenson
2003). Role conflict in relation to employment and negative feelings arising from a ‘duty’ or ‘obligation
to care’ are also more common in filial care, which is predominantly female, than in spousal care, that
involves a significant share of male carers (Pinquart and Sorenson 2011). The strength of the association
between caregiving and psychological wellbeing during the pandemic may have therefore been different
across gender lines. The previously mentioned US study on parents during the pandemic, for example,
found that the probability of experiencing poorer mental health among mothers is nearly twice as high
than among fathers (Hamel and Salganicoff 2020). Lockdown measures such as confinement at home
and home schooling may exacerbate an unequal division of responsibilities at home (Douglas et al.
2020), which is a key determinant of poor mental health for women (Marchand et al. 2016). Finally,
there is early evidence suggesting that unlike in previous economic downturns, women are at a higher
risk of losing their jobs or being furloughed during the COVID-19 crisis (Alon et al. 2020), which in
turn may compound on their stress and affect their wellbeing (Hilgeman et al. 2009).
We posit that the wellbeing of informal carers may have suffered during the pandemic, particularly
among those providing high intensity care. Furthermore, the impact of caregiving as an added stress
factor may have been particularly strong among women and those with childcare responsibilities.
Data and Methods
Data
We use data from a representative survey carried out in Austria between 18 June and 2 July 2020. A
mixed mode design was applied with 80% of respondents taking part in an online survey (CAWI)
whereas 20% were interviewed by telephone (CATI). The sample involved 2,000 respondents (quota
sample based on gender, age, education, household size and regions) aged 20-64. The dataset includes
post stratification weights that have been constructed using information on gender, age group, education,
household size, and region – using auxiliary information from official data to reduce potential sampling
errors and non-response bias. The population distributions for the adjustment variables were obtained
from the Austrian statistical office. Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for the weighted sample.

[TABLE 1 HERE]
Dependent variable
The dependent variable for the multivariate analysis is psychological wellbeing, measured using a
variant of the CES-D scale comprised of 8 items of self-reported symptoms associated with depression.
Respondents were asked about the frequency at which they experienced each feeling in the previous
week, using on four item response scale (see Table 2 for original questions used and response options).
These 8 items were summed to create an additive index (Cronbach’s alpha of 0.85), with a score of 20
or higher determining the threshold for depression (Vilagut et al. 2016).
Care variables
Informal care – defined as providing informal care to frail or disabled family members, friends or
neighbours (but excluding care related to a paid job) either inside or outside the household – is assessed
in the survey in relation to two moments in time: retrospectively in relation to February 2020, before the
coronavirus crisis, as well as at the time of the survey (June/July 2020). This question is used to define
two grouping variables used in the analysis. One is a dichotomous variable for being an informal carer
during the COVID-19 crisis and another is a categorical variable defining four subgroups in the sample:
non-carers throughout, continuous carers, those that began caring only during the coronavirus crisis, and
those that had previously provided care but stopped caring during the crisis.
Variables on care intensity are constructed based on information about the average weekly number of
informal care hours provided: a dummy variable for intense caregiving during the pandemic (i.e. more
than 20 weekly hours of care) and a categorical variable for the change in informal care hours (no
change, increases or decreases by less than hours or by at least 10 hours).We also use information on
whether the cared for person received formal care services prior to the pandemic; and whether or not
these care services changed as a result of the pandemic.
Crisis-related variables
Crisis-specific variables include information on whether or not an individual is concerned about securing
safe care for relatives in need of care and whether an individual’s biggest concern with the COVID-19
crisis are the associated health risks. Two measures of stressors are also included, specifically, financial
worry as a result of the pandemic (assessed using an 11-point scale, with worry defined as 6 or higher)
and changes in the employment situation. The latter is coded as ‘improved’ if the individual was not
employed prior to the pandemic but has been employed at the time of the survey, or if s/he was in
furlough, employed part-time or self-employed before the pandemic and is now in full-time
employment; while it is coded as ‘deteriorated’ if the individual was employed before the pandemic but
has not been employed at the time of the survey, in furlough, employed part-time or self-employed; and
‘remained the same’ if no changes occurred.
Socio-demographic variables
Socio-demographic information included age, gender, education level (ISCED 2011), self-reported
ability to meet financial needs, household size, foreign-born status and a categorical variable on the age
of youngest child. Categories of the latter include: between 0 and 6 years old, between 7 and 17, 18+ or
having no children or no co-residing children (without children, for short).
[TABLE 2 HERE]
Methods
Bivariate analysis employing F-statistics and post hoc tests are used to discern associations between the
four subgroups of the population (carers and non-carers) and a selection of explanatory and sociodemographic variables. To estimate the association of caregiving with depression in comparison to non4

carers, as well as the association of specific caregiving factors amongst carers only (i.e. intensity of
caring, change in hours) we use logistic regression on which average marginal effects (AMEs) or
contrasts of predictive margins for each dependent variable are estimated. To determine if caregiving
during the pandemic has stronger effects on the probability of depression within specific groups, further
analyses are carried out for subgroups of the sample by estimating AMEs for the interaction between
gender and age of the youngest child. The analyses were performed with Stata 15.0 statistical software.
Results
The initial analysis of the prevalence of care before and during the pandemic indicated persistence in
the prevalence of informal care among the Austrian working-age population. The share of informal
carers remained rather stable (12.8% and 14.0% respectively, weighted data). These figures amount to
an estimated 705 thousand individuals providing informal care before the start of the pandemic and
about 767 thousand in June/July 2020 (hence, an increase by about 62 thousand individuals, 55% of
whom were women). This relative stability may mask a re-composition of carers or a changing profile
of caregiving (e.g. through changes in intensity). We thus compared the profile of four different groups:
non-carers throughout, continuous carers, non-carers who started to care only during the pandemic and
previous carers who had stopped caring about three months after its onset (Table 3).
[TABLE 3 HERE]
Results from the F-tests showed statistically significant differences across the four groups on sociodemographic, education and employment variables. The pairwise comparison between single categories
confirmed that most of these statistically significant differences were between non-carers and continuous
carers and had the expected sign according to the literature. Continuous carers were on average older
(in the age range until 64 years included in the sample), more likely to be women, less likely to have
younger children (0-6) and more likely not to have children and less likely to be employed full-time than
non-carers.
In comparison to continuous carers, those who started caring were more educated, had a more genderbalanced profile, a higher probability that their labour market situation had deteriorated due to the crisis
and the persons they cared for were less likely to have received services before the start of the pandemic.
The lack of statistical significance for many of the differences observed for those who started or stopped
caring may be explained by the low overall sample size of these groups. Both continuous carers and
those who started caring were more prone than non-carers to express worry that the care needs of their
relatives would go unmet during the pandemic. While continuous carers expressed greater concerns with
health related to the pandemic than non-carers, those who started providing informal care in the
pandemic did not significantly diverge from non-carers in this respect.
Those who stopped caring during the pandemic were the most gender-balanced group. They had a higher
probability of having seen their labour market situation deteriorate and were the most likely to express
having a lower income due to the crisis. For more than half of those who stopped caring, the cared-for
person had received services before the crisis, which is a significantly larger share than in the two other
groups of carers. Concerns with health related to the pandemic did not seem to explain the decision to
stop caring as they were not more likely than non-carers to express this concern. Those who stopped
caring, however, were the smallest group in our sample and differences were seldom statistically
significant.
Regarding intensity, continuous carers were more likely to care for at least 20 hours per week than those
who either stopped or started to care during the pandemic. The average number of hours of care provided
prior to and during the crisis by continuous carers remained the same (15.7 hours versus 15.5). The
majority of continuous carers did not change their care intensity (55%), but 27% increased their hours
while 17% reduced their care hours. Continuous carers who increased their hours did so on average by
about 6 hours, while those who reduced their hours did so by 11.2 hours. Both those who stopped and
5

those who started to care during the crisis provided less than 10 hours of care per week, on average
(Figure 1). Those who stopped caring tended to provide slightly more care prior to the pandemic (10.8
hours), compared to those who started caring during the pandemic (6.8 hours). Among those reporting
the cared for person received care services before the pandemic (N=105), only 25% reported a cessation
or decrease in the provision of services – sample size precludes any analysis of the association of these
changes to type of caregivers.
[FIGURE 1 HERE]
Next, we turn our attention to the wellbeing of informal carers in Austria during the pandemic. Table 4
presents the AMEs for psychological wellbeing for the pooled sample of carers during the crisis and
non-carers. Informal caregiving during the pandemic has been significantly and positively associated
with poor psychological wellbeing (Model 1). Being a carer about three months after the onset of the
pandemic corresponded with a nearly 7 per cent higher probability of reporting poor psychological wellbeing (who attained a score on the CESD scale that is indicative of a high risk of depression). This
association remains significant and the size of the effect is even strengthened after controlling for a
number of socio-demographic variables (Model 2) and COVID-19-crisis-related stressors (Model 3). As
a reference, prevalence of depression among non-carers during the crisis was 38.8% while for carers it
was 45% (p=0.034).
[TABLE 4 HERE]
Table 5 presents the determinants of psychological wellbeing for carers only, focusing on changes in
the intensity of caregiving. Model 1 suggests that changes to care intensity during the pandemic had no
statistically significant association with psychological wellbeing (Model 1). Once socio-demographic
differences are controlled for (Model 2), increasing care intensity by up to 9 hours showed a positive
and significant association with poor psychological wellbeing, although this association did not hold
once crisis-related stressors, in particular financial worry, were added (Model 3). In the models with
larger sets of controls (Models 2 and 3), starting to care during the pandemic and previously receiving
care services had no significant association with carers’ psychological wellbeing. High intensity care
during the pandemic (i.e. 20 hours per week or more) was significantly and positively associated with
poor psychological wellbeing, and its effect was indeed sizeable. Providing more than 20 hours of
informal care per week increased the probability of depression by nearly 28 per cent (Model 3).
[TABLE 5 HERE]
Finally, the effect of caregiving during the COVID-19 crisis on psychological wellbeing is tested for a
number of sub-groups of carers. Table 6 presents the AMEs for the first and second differences for the
interaction of informal caregiving with gender and having younger children in the household. Results
are presented for the unadjusted model (Model 1) and the one with all the co-variates (Model 3).
Informal caregiving during the COVID-19 crisis had no significant impact on the psychological
wellbeing (p<0.05) for either men or women (first differences). There was also no significant difference
of this effect between men and women (second differences). Informal caregiving during COVID-19 is
thus no more likely to impact the psychological wellbeing of women than men. For those without
children, informal caregiving during the COVID-19 crisis was significantly and positively associated
with depression after controlling for confounders (Model 3) (first differences). Informal caregiving
during COVID-19 had no impact on those with younger children (0-6 years old) or older children (7-17
years old). The second differences are not statistically significant for any group in relation to children.
[TABLE 6 HERE]
Discussion and conclusions
Our findings suggest that the prevalence rate of informal care remained stable during the first wave of
the pandemic in Austria. However, disaggregating carers according to changes in caregiving during the
6

pandemic revealed that those who started to care during the pandemic did so for persons who previously
did not receive care services, and mostly provided low intensity care (an average of 6.8 weekly hours).
They were also more educated and nearly as likely to be men as women. These ‘new’ informal carers
fit the profile of sporadic carers providing help with household tasks (e.g. groceries, collecting
medicines) to frail or disabled people who were relatively autonomous and probably remained in selfisolation, rather than stepping in for discontinued formal care. A further potential motive for initiating
care may be explained by a worry about unmet needs of relatives, which was at a comparable level with
continuous carers. Those who stopped caring during the pandemic had mostly provided low intensity
care to people who received formal care before the onset of the pandemic This profile is compatible
with the tightening of care networks observed during the pandemic (Volkshilfe 2020; Maccora et al.
2020). Ceasing to care was not apparently motivated by health concerns related to the pandemic or
financial difficulties (those who stopped caring were the least worried about financial problems). These
carers had the worst average psychological wellbeing of any group, therefore ceasing to care may have
been motivated by health reasons. In this case, being able to rely on care services may have served as a
buffer for carers who stopped caregiving during the crisis as they were no more likely than other carers
to fear unmet needs of relatives.
We find no evidence that the intensity of informal care has increased during the pandemic in Austria.
Those who stopped and started to care during the pandemic did not significantly differ in their care
intensity. Among continuous carers, mean intensity remained the same before and after the onset of the
pandemic. A greater share of continuous carers increased intensity compared to the new carers, but
mostly at the margins (i.e. variations below 10 hours). This corroborates other findings that suggest a
greater number of informal carers increased their hours, e.g. by stepping in for other carers (Volkshilfe
2020). Decreases in intensity among continuous carers were more sporadic (i.e. fewer) but on average
with larger changes in hours, suggesting that those who diminished their care hours may have done so
in response to competing caring obligations arising from the lockdown.
Caregiving during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with poorer psychological outcomes, even
after controlling for crisis-related changes. Although this is an association that has been systematically
found elsewhere in the literature (Pinquart and Sorenson 2003, Ho et al. 2009), the pandemic may have
contributed to the care burden, not least by increasing the concerns related to health (e.g. contagion and
health of relatives), or financial worry – both were higher among carers during the crisis. However, we
could not conclude that caregiving during the coronavirus crisis placed a particular psychological strain
on women, in comparison to men. We also found that caregiving was associated with worse outcomes
for those without children or whose children were already adult or outside the household, but not for
those with non-adult children in the household. The literature on the ‘sandwich generation’ is limited,
but available evidence and social role theory do suggest that a (lack of) time and role conflict regarding
employment are key determinants of psychological strain for this group of carers (Stephens et al. 2001,
Do et al. 2014). The pandemic caused a marked increase in unemployment and the implementation of a
furlough (Kurzarbeit) scheme that at its height covered one third of the workforce in Austria (Böheim
and Leoni 2020). The short term effect of these changes may have resulted in increased time for unpaid
activities, thus temporarily contributing to ease stress. Other studies on the social implications of the
pandemic have found improved family relationships during the lockdown (Power 2020), in itself a key
determinant of psychological wellbeing of carers, that could have offset the caregiving strain (Pinquart
and Sorenson 2011). The lockdown measures in Austria were stringent but limited in duration, and had
been considerably eased at the time of the survey. As schools and kindergartens reopened, this might
have also eased the competing caring obligations for these carers. Finally, lockdown measures are likely
to have increased isolation and this may have been felt more particularly by informal carers without
children (Carers UK 2020, Carers Trust 2020). The survey did not collect information on frequency of
other contacts, so this is an aspect to be investigated by further research.
As for changes in the intensity of informal care brought by the pandemic, these had mostly no effect on
psychological wellbeing once COVID-19-specific stressors were considered, including change in
7

employment situation. Increased time for unpaid care derived from job loss or furlough may explain this
finding. As in other studies prior to the pandemic, care intensity was significantly associated with poor
psychological outcomes (Buyck et al. 2011, Vlachantoni et al. 2013).
There are a number of caveats to consider. This is a cross-sectional survey and it is not possible to
establish causality or compare certain outcomes (e.g. psychological wellbeing) with the ex-ante
situation. To partially circumvent this, we included retrospective questions on pre-COVID-19, which
sets this survey apart from data collected only in reference to after/ during the pandemic. Given the short
time since the outbreak of COVID-19, recall bias is likely to be limited. Finally, while we can observe
changes in informal caregiving, we cannot ascertain whether these changes cover all care gaps or result
in unmet needs for the care receiver.
From a policy standpoint, the findings confirm the vulnerability of carers to depression during the
pandemic, which calls for support services specifically targeting carers to be enacted. Carers are more
likely to experience deteriorating employment conditions and to worry about the financial consequences
of the crisis. While the Austrian cash-for-care benefit (Pflegegeld) may be used as a ‚routed wage‘, the
lack of specific measures of income support may put carers at a heightened risk of poverty. Their caring
responsibilities may also place them at a disadvantage in returning to the labour market. The crisis may
thus have a greater scarring effect on their long-term income perspectives (Alon et al. 2020).
With a second wave of COVID-19 already underway, this study provides pointers to researchers and
policy-makers alike on the impact of the crisis on the wellbeing of informal carers. It also sheds light on
informal carers, which will be crucial to maintain older people safe and protected during the course of
this pandemic.
