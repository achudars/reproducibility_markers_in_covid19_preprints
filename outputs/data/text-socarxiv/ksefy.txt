Abstract
BACKGROUND
All available evidence suggests that the number of deaths linked to COVID-19 among those living in
nursing homes is extremely high. Yet, it remains unknown to what extent there are socio-economic
differences among nursing home residents, which can lead, in turn, to social inequality in mortality
linked to COVID.
OBJECTIVE
We investigate whether there are educational differences in the likelihood of living in a nursing home
across 13 European countries: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.
METHODS
We use SHARE data (waves 5-7). We compute logistic regression models for rare events.
RESULTS
We find that there are sizeable differences in the probability of being in a nursing home, with loweducated individuals more likely to live in this kind of arrangement. This general pattern holds in all
the European countries considered. There is considerable uncertainty in our estimates due to small
Ns problems and firm conclusions on how the effect of education varies across countries cannot be
drawn. Still, there is some indication that the largest educational differences are found in the
Scandinavian countries and the smaller ones, even close to zero, in Southern European Countries,
with countries in Continental Europe and Eastern Europe laying in between.

CONTRIBUTION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides country specific evidence of
educational differences in the probability of being in a nursing home in recent years. In this way, we
also provide indirect evidence on social inequality in mortality linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction
All available evidence suggests that the number of deaths for COVID-19 among those living in
nursing and care homes (from now onward we will refer to nursing homes to include both type of
accommodations) is extremely high. Nursing homes host elderly individuals often with extra need of
support in their personal care and pre-existing health conditions. Nursing home residents share
common spaces and have daily contacts with the same caring assistants. Altogether, these
circumstances increase their risk of both being exposed to COVID-19 and to develop its severe
symptoms. Moreover, in case of illness, the quality of medical cure in nursing homes is generally
inferior compared to the one provided in a hospital. All this make nursing homes a critical trouble
spot in the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a recent report, for instance, in Belgium and France
about half of deaths linked to COVID-19 happened in nursing homes (Comas-Herrera et al. 2020).
Recent report in the news suggests that in Sweden and the Netherlands one third of fatalities were
people living in nursing homes. Similar or higher proportions are also documented in Italy and Spain
(Frijters, van Uffelen, 2020; Orange, 2020).
Against this backdrop, in this research note we investigate whether there are educational
differences in the likelihood of living in a nursing home in Europe. To do so, we use data from the
2013-2017 waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and we focus
on individuals aged 65 and older living in 13 European countries: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and
Switzerland. A previous study based on SHARE data between 2007 and 2011 already suggests that
in Europe moving into nursing home is more frequent among those with low wealth and income
(Laferrère, Van Den Heede, & Van Den Bosch, 2012). With respect to that study, our contribution is
threefold. We use more recent data from 2013 to 2017, consider a larger number of countries, and
present results separated for each country. To the best of our knowledge, no study has addressed
3

country-specific educational inequalities in nursing home access so far. In this way we provide a
country specific snapshot of educational differences in the probability of living in care homes in very
recent years and, thus, indirectly of educational inequalities in the risk of being exposed to the
COVID-19 epidemic within care homes in 2020.
In the next section we describe data, variables, and method used for the analysis. We then
present our main findings on educational inequalities in the probability of living in nursing home
based on SHARE data. In the conclusion we discuss the more general implication of our findings for
studies on social inequality and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Data, variables and method
In this study, we use the last three available waves (wave 5, 6 and 7; 2013-2017) of the Survey of
Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), which is a cross-national biannual panel
collecting information on individuals older than 50 years old across 27 European countries and Israel.
We restrict our analyses to individuals older than 65 years old, and to those European countries which
have a sufficient number of individuals living in a nursing home in 2017 (at least 10 cases),
heterogeneously distributed across educational levels. After applying these restrictions, we are left
with the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. For the Netherlands we
consider the most recent data available, from wave 5 (2013).
We perform two analyses. In the first analysis we use only the 2017 data. Our dependent
variable refers to the residential arrangement of the respondent at the time of the interview (2017)
and distinguishes whether an individual was living in a nursing home rather than a private household.
This analysis provides us with the most updated snapshot of educational differences in residential
arrangements.

4

In the second analysis we pool data from the waves 5, 6 and 7 and consider whether the
respondents were living in a nursing home in any of the three years considered. We also include
respondents who moved to a nursing homes between wave 5 and 6 or between wave 6 and 7 and died
in a nursing home in-between the two waves. The dependent variable in the pooled analysis refers to
the probability of having ever lived in nursing home between 2013 and 2017. In this analysis we have
a larger number of cases and, including those who have died between 2013 and 2017, we can partially
take into account selective mortality by education (more on this issue below).
In SHARE, nursing home are defined in the following way. “A nursing home provides all of
the following services for its residents: dispensing of medication, available 24-hour personal
assistance and supervision (not necessarily a nurse), and room and meals” (Laferrère et al. 2012, p.
254). Therefore, the category “nursing home” reasonably includes several forms of residential care
for older people.
The key independent variable is the level of education of the respondent. From the
International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) we define two categories: low (ISCED
0-2) and high (ISCED 3-6) education.
To investigate educational differences in the probability of residing in a nursing home, given
the small absolute number of individuals living in nursing home, we estimate rare event logit models
(Coveney, 2015). When the event of interest is rare, conventional logit model tend to underestimate
the probability of the event and produce a biased estimation of the coefficient of the explanatory
variables (Williams, 2017). Rare event logit models are estimated with the Firthlogit command in
STATA, with a penalized likelihood function that reduces the small-sample bias.
We specify the following rare event logit model

Pr(𝑁𝑢𝑟𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝐻𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 1) = 𝛽1 (𝐿𝑜𝑤𝐸𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑) + 𝛽2 (𝑀𝑎𝑙𝑒)

(1)
5

Where Pr(𝑁𝑢𝑟𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝐻𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 1) is the predicted risk of being in a nursing home;
𝛽1 (𝐿𝑜𝑤𝐸𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑) is the estimated difference for low educated compared to high educated;
𝛽2 (𝑀𝑎𝑙𝑒) is the control variable for the sex of the respondent.
In the models we do not control for age. This is a critical decision that has to be discussed
carefully. Age, as an indicator of cohort of birth, is a possible confounder of the relationship between
education and the probability of living in a nursing home. On the one hand, older people tend to be
less educated and, on the other, older individuals have more need of support for personal care and are
thus more likely to live in nursing home. At the same time, however, education affects life expectancy
so that low-educated individuals tend to have lower life expectancies than those who are high
educated. If low-educated individuals who reach older ages are positively selected on other typically
unobserved characteristics, such as genetic predisposition to have good health, our results probably
underestimate of effect of low education on residential arrangement. In addition to being a possible
confounder, age is also a collider in the relationship between education and the probability of living
in a nursing home (Greenland, 2006; Schooling & Yeung, 2017). For this reason, if we also control
for age in our models, we are likely to introduce a further bias in the estimates of the effect of
education.
Our compromise solution is to focus only on people older than 65 and not to control for age
in our main analysis. In this way we believe that we limit both the confounding and collider biases.
Moreover, in the pooled analysis we also include those who have died in between the waves, and in
this way we reduce the possible bias due to selective mortality by education. As a robustness check,
however, we also present results based on a model that includes age as a control variable.

Results
Descriptive Results
In table 1 we present the distribution of our dependent and key independent variable, i.e. percentage
of respondents living in a nursing home in 2017 (column 1) and of those who have ever lived in a
nursing home between 2013 and 2017 (column 2) and the percentage of low educated (column 3) for
each country. Overall, the in the share of individuals residing in a nursing home is very low, although
there are notable differences across countries. In Western Europe, Belgium has the largest share of
over 65 residing in a nursing home (%), while Italy has the smallest (%). The share of individuals in
nursing homes estimated from SHARE matches the OCED official figures relatively well. The
correlation between the percentages in Table 1 for 2017 and the number of beds x1000 in nursing
homes over the population aged 65 years old or more based on OECD 2017 data is far from perfect
but reasonably high (r=0.65).
The absolute number of individuals living in nursing home in our sample is very low,
particularly in the cross-sectional analysis for 2017, with the number varying from a maximum of
115 in Belgium to a minimum of 14 in Italy. We also find cross-country variability in the overall
share of over 65 with low educational level. Spain and Italy have the largest share of low educated
(ISCED 0-2), more than 75%; whereas Austria and Germany have the smallest share, less than 25%.
In the robustness section, we discuss results based on different definition of education.

Main Results
Figure 1 below reports the odds ratios and the 95% confidence interval for the probability of the low
educated of being in a nursing home compared to high-educated individuals estimated with a rare

7

event logit model. The left panel refers to the cross-sectional analysis for 2017, while the right one
to the pooled data between 2013 and 2017.
[FIGURE 1 here]

In 2017, in all countries we find that low-educated individuals have a higher probability of
being in a nursing home compared to those who are highly educated. The confidence interval of our
point estimates are very large, given the small Ns issues in many countries, and a close comparison
of effect sizes is not possible. In some countries, however, the effects are large and the odds of living
in a nursing home for low educated is two to four times higher. When we perform the analysis on the
pooled 2013-2017 data the overall pattern is confirmed, the estimates become more precise and the
confidence intervals shrinks thanks to the larger Ns. In some countries like Italy and Germany the
odds ratio also gets reduced. A possible interpretation for this reduction is that in those countries
nursing home are mostly end-of-life institutions and previous research shows that entry into a nursing
home shortly before death is less dependent on income and wealth (Laferrère et al. 2012).
In general terms, in the two analyses reported in Figure 1 we observe larger odds ratios in
Scandinavian countries and smaller ones in Southern European Countries, with countries in
Continental Europe and Eastern Europe laying in between. As already noted, the confidence intervals
of our estimates are very large and overlap in all countries.
As a robustness check, we have estimated our model controlling for age (Figure 2). With the
caveat discussed above of a likely bias due to the fact that education is a collider, in this specification
the odds ratios get reduced but they are still positive in the majority of the countries considered. In
most of the countries the estimates are not statistically significant at the conventional level of alpha
equal to 0.05. We interpret the absence of statistical significance as evidence that there is considerable
uncertainty around the point estimates but not as an indication that there is no effect (Bernardi,
Chakhaia, & Leopold, 2017). Figure 2 then suggests that the overall pattern of educational differences
8

in the probability of living in a nursing home for each country is confirmed also when we control for
age. We have also used a different definition of education with three categories: low (ISCED 0/2);
medium (ISCED 3/4); high (ISCED 5/6). Results are consistent with those in Figure 1 and available
upon request. Finally, since there is a substantial variability in the educational distribution across the
13 countries, we have replicated our analyses using a country-specific relative measure of education,
adopting a strategy similar to Reardon (2011). Within each country we computed the cumulative
distribution of education and generated a ratio as the risk of the 20th bottom percentile divided the top
80th percentile of being in a nursing home. The results (again available upon requests) are highly
consistent with those presented in Figure 1.

[FIGURE 2 here]

Conclusions
Our analyses show that low-educated individuals are more likely to live in nursing homes. This result
is found across the 13 countries included in our study. In the majority of countries, we find odds ratio
close or greater than two, suggesting that differences in the probability of living in a care home by
education are sizeable. There is, however, considerable uncertainty in our estimates due to small Ns
problems and firm conclusions on how the effect of education varies across countries cannot be
drawn. Still, there is some indication that the largest educational differences are found in the
Scandinavian countries and the smaller ones, even close to zero, in Southern European Countries,
with countries in Continental Europe and Eastern Europe laying in between. Once we control for age
the odds ratios get smaller, but the general pattern is still confirmed, indicating that low-educated
people have an higher probability of living in a nursing home. We have also noted that age is a collider
of the relationship between education and the probability of living in nursing home, and that including

9

age as a control variable is likely to bias the estimates of the effect of education (Greenland, 2003).
This is a complex methodological issue that we could not adequately address in this research note.
With all due cautiousness due to the small Ns and large confidence intervals for many
countries, our central finding holds important implications for those interested in social inequality
and concerned with public policy in the COVID-19 pandemics, more generally. Currently we know
little about how mortality rates linked to COVID-19 in the overall population (not only in care homes)
varies by socio-economic groups. In most of the countries we know the age, sex and place of residence
of those who have died by COVID-19, but the information on their occupation or level of education
is not available.
Given the extremely high death toll in care homes, evidence on differences in the probability
of being in care home provides indirect but clear evidence of the existence of social inequality in the
risk of mortality linked to COVID-19. The finding of our article therefore contradicts the idea that
COVID-19 affects all equally and add socioeconomic status to the gender and age as important
dimensions to consider, when studying COVID mortality.
The finding that low socio-economic groups are disproportionally present in nursing homes
and thus more exposed to the pandemic also raises issues of social justice. Guaranteeing adequate
protection against infection in the nursing homes is paramount issue not only of public health in
reducing the scope of the pandemic, but also of social policy toward inequality reduction.
A major limitation of our study is that since the proportion of older population living in
nursing home is low, even in SHARE one ends up working with very low Ns. It would, then, be
desirable to replicate our findings using administrative data or ad hoc large surveys on nursing home
access and their residents for those countries where such data are available.
