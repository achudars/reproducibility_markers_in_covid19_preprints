Nexus between population density and COVID-19
pandemic in the south Indian states: A geostatistical approach
Abstract
Background:
The unprecedented growth of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) as a severe acute
respiratory syndrome escalated to the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
pandemic. It has created an unanticipated global public health crisis. The virus is
spreading rapidly in India which poses serious threat to 135 crore population.
Population density poses some unforeseen challenges to control the COVID-19
contagion. In times of crisis, data is crucial to understand the spatial relationship
between density and the infection. The article study the district wise transmissions of
the novel coronavirus in five south Indian states until 6th June 2020 and its
relationship with the respective population density.
Methods:
Data has been derived from COVID-19 India portal and Census of five different
states. The five states are purposefully selected for better healthcare infrastructure visà-vis other states in India. The correlation of the population density and COVID-19
positive cases are evaluated using the statistical software and the district-wise data of
COVID-19 infections and population density maps are produced in GIS environment.
Results:
We observed that corona virus spread depends on the spatial distribution of
population density in three states especially in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Telangana.
The results indicate that the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 crisis are likely to
differ with demographic density.
Conclusions:
Policy initiatives aimed at reducing the health consequences of the COVID-19
pandemic should understand how vulnerabilities cluster together across districts.

Background
COVID- 19 has been originated from Wuhan city of Hubei province in China. Covid19 stances for corona virus disease which has been first identified in 2019 and caused
by extreme acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).[1,2,3] This virus
disease rapidly circled all over the world and has been announced pandemic by the
world health organization.[4,5] More than 213 countries and territories have reported
6969079 confirmed COVID- 19 cases after china and thereafter it has been shifted in
Europe and other countries.[6] Thereafter this virus transmitted in the United States of
America and Latin American countries. As for the number of patients diagnosed with
the Corona virus, the USA is at the top of the list preceded by Brazil.[7] Currently, the
highest infected and deceased rate is in USA. Millions of people have been
contaminated across the world, and many thousands have already died. Apart from
direct diseases, this pandemic will affect almost every human being on Earth in one
way or the other.[8] The pandemic has triggered significant global socioeconomic
disruption, such as postponing and cancelling sports, educational, political, and
cultural events.[9] The first confirmed case of the COVID-19 outbreak in India was
registered in Thrissur district of Kerala state of south India on 30 January 2020, when
a student arrived from China.[10] After that, it has been transmitted most of the states
throughout India.[11] As of June 6, 2020, India has reported 246622 confirmed cases
and 6946 deaths from coronavirus infection in 31 states and union territories.[12,13]
India is a vast country with varying climate, cultures, languages, employment and
educational opportunities, culminating in distinct and complex patterns of
interconnection between various areas. This country has the second largest population
with 121 crore people next to China.[14] The states of India vary widely in terms of
population density. As per the Census of India 2011, the population density of India
has 382 persons per square kilometre.[14] Our study focuses on investigating the trend
of COVID-19 and the population density analysis for the case of five south Indian
states (Kerala, Karnataka, Tamilnadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh) which has
developed healthcare systems to fight against COVID-19. Among these five states,
Kerala has the highest population density with 860 persons per square
kilometre.[14].This diverse population density of five states has a different impact on
the COVID-19 pandemic. On 22 March 2020 when cases rose, The Prime Minister of
India declared a nationwide 21-day lockdown to reduce the effects of new
coronavirus.[15] To minimize the effect and spread of the novel coronavirus, lockdown
operations are conducted across the country with rigorous restrictions on transport
with human mobility and economic activity. Since there are no pharmaceutical
medications in place or corona virus vaccines, a high transmission rate of this virus is
expected, which will pose major challenges in controlling disease spread.[16]

Demographically Kerala, Karnataka, Tamilnadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have
emerged as an exception over the last few decades.[14,17] These states have low birth
rates and low death rates rather than other states of India. Population density, one of
the foremost fundamental demographic attributes, could vary systematically with
abstraction scale. According to the 2011 census, the population density in Kerala is
860 persons per sq.km. It is much higher than the level of 382 for all India. Next to
Kerala is Tamilnadu state where every square kilometre is inhabited by 555 people.[14]
The remaining three states are Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have 319,
312 and 304 population density.[18,19] The number of COVID-19 cases in Tamilnadu
crossed 30000 as the total infections continued its upward trend till 6th June 2020.[20]
Just over two months since its first COVID-19 case, Karnataka state has reported
5103 positive corona cases.[21] In the Telangana State, the surge in COVID-19 cases
continued with the total number of people affected to 3496.[22] Coronavirus is
spreading in Andhra Pradesh despite the lockdown with a total number of positive
cases is 3588.[23] Among the all south Indian states, Kerala has reported the least
number of positive cases with only 1807 infections in 14 districts.[24] Kerala has a
high-quality public health infrastructure among all other states of India. However, the
number of cases is increasing as mentioned in figure 1 which is an alarming situation
for these five states.[12]
In the wake of the latest COVID-19 crisis, one of the most pressing issues is to gain a
better understanding of the corona positive cases in which population density has
determined different patterns in South Indian states. It is evident that cities with high
population density have a large number of corona positive cases.[25,26] This study
contributes to ongoing COVID-19 monitoring efforts by identifying reported cases
with population density at the district level. Spatial analysis has been done in GIS
environment for the evaluation and distribution of COVID-19 cases and the density of
districts. Our current and potential analysis can be resumed every day as new data are
available to detect new emerging zones and focus on areas where transmission
decreases or increases.

Methods
Data used
In this study, we made an attempt to correlate population density with the number of
COVID-19 positive cases in different districts of south India. The present research
work based on secondary sources of information. Data regarding corona virus cases
has been collected from Covid-19 India portal and Ministry of Health & Family
Welfare as of 10th May 2020. Population density data of Kerala, Karnataka and
Tamilnadu states has been collected from the Census of India 2011. Remaining two
states, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh population density data retrieved from
Statistical Year Book 2017 (Directorate of Economics and Director Statistics,
Telangana) and Districts at a Glance, Andhra Pradesh 2018 (Directorate of Economics
and Statistics, Andhra Pradesh) respectively. The districts have been taken as the unit
of analysis. Fourteen districts from Kerala, thirty eight districts from Tamilnadu,
thirty districts from Karnataka, thirty three districts from Telangana and thirteen
districts from Andhra Pradesh have been included in the analysis.
Methodology

5

The correlation of the population density and COVID-19 positive cases are evaluated
using the R statistical software and the district-wise data of COVID-19 infections and
population density maps are produced in GIS environment using ArcGIS software.[28]
The inter-district variation are grouped into five categories i.e. very low, low,
medium, high and very high. Pearson correlation coefficient has been applied to
examine the association between the number of COVID-19 infected cases and
population density. The correlation coefficient has been calculated by the following
equation:
Correlation coefficient: Correlation is a statistical method that determines the degree
of relationship between two different variables. A correlation coefficient is a
numerical measure of a statistical relationship between two variables. One of the most
important features of the correlation coefficient is it can only range from –1.00 to
+1.00. Therefore, normalization of the data was done in R statistical. If the correlation
coefficient approaches r = +1.00 (or greater than r = +.50) it depicts a strong positive
relationship or a high degree of relationship between the two variables. If the
correlation coefficient approaches r = -1.00 (or less than r = -.50), it refers that there is
a strong negative relationship. If the correlation coefficient approaches r = 0.00, it
indicates that there is no correlation between the two variables. After normalization of
all data sets, a correlation study was carried out using the ‘Pearson Product-Moment
Correlation Coefficient’ to measure the degree of relationship between two
continuous variables.[29] The Pearson’s coefficient r was obtained using the following
formula in R statistical:

Where, n= number of pairs of score
= sum of x scores
= sum of y scores
= sum of the products of paired scores
= sum of squared x scores
= sum of squared y scores
After computing the r value for a specified data set, a test was done to check the
significance of the Correlation Coefficient. A two-tailed test of significance was
carried out. Thus, the value of r and the number of pairs of scores were converted
through a formula into a distribution called the‘t’ distribution. The‘t’ formula was
deliberately used to test whether r is equal to zero. The formula used for‘t’ test was:
6

t = r / ∑ (1-

) / (n-2)

Where r = correlation coefficient and n = the number of pairs of scores.
Degree of freedom: Degrees of freedom describes the number of independent values
that a statistical analysis can estimate. It was measured by N - 2 where N is the
number of pairs of scores.
Scatterplot has done in Microsoft Excel to represent the relationship between two
numerical variables. One variable was chosen in the horizontal axis and another in the
vertical axis. Here, ‘Population Density’ was used in the horizontal axis and ‘Covid19 Positive Cases’ was used in the vertical axis to plot the diagram for the
representation of the data sets.
Why South Indian states?
Health inequalities exist in India due to the unequal distribution of health services
across the States. India’s healthcare infrastructure is unable to cope with the present
COVID-19 crisis. The major problems are shortages in medical supplies and a failure
to provide adequate testing. This study examined health infrastructure focusing on
hospital beds in five south Indian states. In India, there are 18, 99,228 hospital beds
and 1.13 beds per thousand which includes government and private hospitals.
According to the latest Health Index report,[27] Kerala state has arisen as the best
healthcare infrastructure in India. Tamilnadu and Karnataka state have a poor capacity
than the national average. However, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana state have poor
capacity of hospital beds per thousand persons. Overall, southern India has a better
capacity to serve patients. But still, it is insufficient to fight this pandemic with the
current amount of resources.

Kerala is located within the southwestern end of the Indian landmass. Kerala is
bordered to the south and east by Tamil Nadu, to the north and northeast by
Karnataka. The tropical climate and the rich monsoons offer beautiful landscapes,
ample bodies of water, long beaches and over 40 rivers add to the charm. Popular by
the name "God's Own Country", the location of Kerala is geographically located
between 74º 27´ to 77º 37´ north latitudes and 8º 17´ to 12º 47´ east longitudes. The
population in Kerala is 33,406,061 according to Provisional Population Figures
2011.[14] Kerala is home to nearly 3 percent of India's population and its land is three
times denser than the rest of India.
Tamil Nadu is India's 11th largest state in terms of size, and the country's third largest
urbanized population. The state, with a population of 72,138,958 (Census 2011), is
the seventh most populated state in the country and covers an area of 130,058 sq.km.
This state is bounded by Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka on the north, Kerala on the
west, the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Indian Ocean on the south. Tamilnadu
extends with a geographical extent between 8° 5' and 13° 35' North and 76° 15' and
80° 20' east.[14]

Karnataka is located in the southwestern part of India. It shares its boundaries with the
southwest Kerala, northwest Goa, southeast Tamilnadu and east Andhra Pradesh. In
terms of population, Karnataka ranks ninth in India. According to Census 2011,
Karnataka has a population of 6.11 Crores. The total geographical area of the state is
191,791 square km. Karnataka State is situated at 11°30' to 18°30' North latitudes and
74° to 78°30' East longitude.[14]
Telangana state was carved out of the earlier Andhra Pradesh and established in the
Indian Union as the twenty ninth state with a geographic area of 1,12,077 sq. km.
Telangana is found on the Deccan highland and lies within the Southern region of
India. The State is surrounded by the Maharashtra state to the north, Chhattisgarh to
the north, Karnataka to the west and Andhra Pradesh to the south and east. The total
population of the state is about 3.50 crore as per the Census 2011. Telangana stretches
from 16° 30' to 18° 20' northern latitudes and 77° 30' to 79° 30' eastern longitudes.[18]
Andhra Pradesh state is located in the southeastern part of the Indian subcontinent. It
is delimited to the south by the Indian states of Tamil Nadu, to the southwest and west
by Karnataka, to the northwest by Telangana and to the northeast by Odisha. The state
includes a substantial portion of the Eastern Ghats and the eastern part of the Deccan
plateau. The total population of the State is 49,386,799, with a geographical area of
162,975 km, according to census 2011. Andhra Pradesh lies between latitude 12° 41'
to 19° 07' N and longitude 77° to 84° 40'E.[19]

Results
The recent COVID-19 infections have triggered major health burdens in many states
across the India[30]. COVID-19 cases in India are well over 246622 as of 6th June
2020. It is found that Tamilnadu has the highest corona positive cases followed by
Karnataka and Telangana state. Among all five south Indian states, Kerala has the
lowest positive cases and Andhra Pradesh has the highest rate of recovery for
coronavirus infections. However, the mortality rate is very low in south Indian states
in comparison to the country. The whole south India regulates the pandemic more
deftly than the other Indian states. Cases have risen sharply in Tamil Nadu, but
mortality is relatively under low. In Andhra Pradesh, only 73 persons have lost their
lives and Karnataka, another powerful COVID-19 fighter, with over 5103 reports, is
witnessing 57 fatalities. Our main aim was to compare all district wise covid-19 cases
with the relation of demographic density in all 5 states. Table 2 depicts the overall
scenario of corona virus affected south Indian states with comparison to India.

A Pearson correlation was conducted to explore the relationships between the
population density and COVID-19 positive cases for south Indian states. As shown in
Table 3, the results revealed that a significantly large and positive association between
density and Covid-19 cases in Tamilnadu [where r (36) = 0.99] and Telangana states

association between these two variables for the state of Kerala. The relationships
between COVID-19 cases and population density for Andhra Pradesh state have
shown statistically insignificant [where r (11) = 0.003].

Discussion
We have conducted a spatial study in different districts of five south Indian states and
found that Tamilnadu, Telangana and Karnataka has positive relation between
population density and COVID-19 positive cases. Remaining two states, Kerala and
Andhra Pradesh has no association between these two indicators.
Kerala state
As of June 6, 2020, Kerala, a high population density state, has already recorded 1807
confirmed COVID-19 cases. Most of the corona affected patients are mainly found in
the northern part of Kerala. Kannur and Kasaragod districts have maximum positive
cases. This state has done a remarkable job that 95% of those infected have
completely recovered with a case fatality rate of 0.78% till 10th May, 2020. After that,
corona cases started to increase in different parts of the state due to international
migration.[24] However death rate is low as compared to the national average 2.82%.
11

In order to understand the influence of population density, we performed Pearson
correlation using the COVID-19 data. However, a negative relationship is seen
between these two variables. So COVID-19 positive incidents happened without any
relation to the population density of different districts. Kerala government COVID-19
portal indicates that the international migration factor induced the positive cases.[24]
The choropleth map of figure 4a is depicting a districtwide variation of density and
corona cases. In order to understand the correlation, we have shown a scatter plot for
better representation.

Tamilnadu state
Tamilnadu has recorded 30152 corona positive cases which is the highest number in
south India. According to the state health bulletin, the Chennai district alone reported
20993 cases of corona virus in the whole state which have a population density of
26553 persons per square km. The North Chennai Koyambedu market has identified
as the recent hotspot of COVID-19.[31] Near about 2,000 cases were related to the
popular market of Chennai. Like Kerala, this state also has a very low mortality rate
of about 0.83%. Data represented in table 8 shows the positive correlation between
the population density and the number of covid-19 cases. Following figure 5a clearly
depicts the spatial analysis between density and corona infections in different districts
of the Tamilnadu.

Karnataka state
After Tamilnadu state, Karnataka has highest number of Covid-19 cases which is
about 5103. Kalaburgi, Udupi, Yadagiri and Mandya districts has kept the Karnataka
government on its toes due to sharp surge in the number of Covid-19 cases. Till 10th
May, Bangalore Urban district has the highest COVID-19 cases but now Udupi is
most infected district among the state.[32] The recovery rate in the state is at 29.85
percent and the fatality rate is 1.12 percent. From figure 6a, it is clearly found that,
districts of northern Karnataka have more corona cases rather than southern
Karnataka. As of 6th June 2020, about 29 districts out of 30 districts have been
contaminated with corona in Karnataka state. Table 3 indicated a positive association
between population density and COVID-19 cases.

Telangana state
Telangana state has observed a spike in the number of COVID-19 cases on daily
basis. Currently, the state has infected by 3496 persons and out of this infected 1710
persons recovered and 123 persons got deceased. This state has 3.52 percent mortality
rate which is highest in south India and also above the national average 2.82 percent.
It is also observed that Hyderabad district has the highest COVID-19 cases within the
state which is about 60 percent and also has a high population density 680 persons per
sq. km. We have utilized a prospective space-time correlation analysis to detect
severely affected districts of COVID-19 in the Telangana. A strong correlation is
found between the number of COVID-19 cases and the density of different districts.

Andhra Pradesh state
Coronavirus is spreading in Andhra Pradesh in despite of the lockdown with 3588
positive cases till 6th June 2020. The percentage of discharged persons and the fatality
rate are 65 percent and 2.03 percent respectively. Kurnool, Guntur and Krishna
districts are maximally infected among thirteen districts in the state. Among all south
Indian states, Andhra Pradesh has the lowest population density with 304 persons per
sq. km. Figure 8a shows the spatial distribution of corona positive cases and
demographic density in the state. The dark red colour shows a higher population
density and high COVID-19 cases. We didn’t find any meaningful association of
population density with corona infections for this state.

Conclusions
This paper examines publicly available data from the COVID-19 India portal and
state government portals to detect emerging space-time distribution of COVID-19
contagion for different districts. Our results from data accumulated from the five
south Indian states illustrate the significance of the relationship between population
density and corona positive cases. Regarding the inter-district spatial analysis from
south Indian states, we observe that the population density better explains the
contagion effect. However, the population density of Kerala and Andhra Pradesh state
did not reflect on corona transmission. We find that the positive correlation
coefficients that represent the infectious effects from Tamilnadu, Karnataka and
Telangana states. Confirmed case numbers are insufficient to recognize the true nature
of the COVID-19 pandemic. However compiling data sets which include suspected,
potential and negative test numbers can significantly boost monitoring efforts and our
understanding of the transmission dynamics COVID-19.[33,34] Despite the significance
of our study, it's important to mention limitations. A key limitation of the study is
that, even within this nine week sampling duration, we are not able to disassociate the
effects of each of the strict steps taken. Another constraint is that the case data
contains only confirmed cases, thus it is important to note that possible and suspected
cases are not included because of lack of availability. The true character of the
COVID-19 pandemic will not be understood for some time. Lastly, there are many
districts that were included in the analysis that did not have any positive cases of
COVID-19.
19

We understand the importance of maintaining observation on emerging and active
districts during pandemics, effectively ignoring preceding districts that do not present
a serious threat to public health. In addition, the sharing and availability of data are
very important and enables a variety of researchers to contribute to their knowledge of
COVID-19 in general. Demographers can play a crucial role in mitigating the spread
of diseases.
