The COVI D-19 pandemic continues to alter daily life and lead to changes in the way we spend
time outside. In an effort to gather timely and relevant data on national recreation patterns,
the Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics and its academic partner, Pennsylvania State
University, have been working to conduct a study that can offer guidance to land managers,
recreation providers, and outdoor enthusiasts across the United States. Through three
phases of survey-based data collection, ranging from April 9th to May 21st, 2020, a
longitudinal perspective of how outdoor recreationists are reacting to the COVID-19
pandemic was developed from this research. The timing of this research was purposeful, as it
intended to capture self-reported information related to outdoor recreation and COVI D-19
during periods of time when the virus had been officially documented as a pandemic,
resulting federal and state stay-at-home orders were implemented across the U.S., and many
parks and protected closed or discontinued regular operations. Phases 1and 2 of this
assessment were detailed by previous reports1. This report details the findings across all
three phases of research. These findings track behaviors, psychosocial determinants of
outdoor recreation decision-making, and future intentions across the study period. This
report is intended to provide valuable information for managing the changing recreation use
of public lands, predicting spikes in recreation, and offering insight for land managers as they
work to protect the natural world.
The following tables, figures, and corresponding brief descriptions are intended to compare
results across the three phases of this research effort.
Please note that not all respondents answered all questions.

frequency in Phases 2 and 3 being significantly higher than in Phase 1(Table 2). The effect

+“ Please indicate by what amount you have changed your use of the following types of recreation areas."

A considerable change in use of various types of public lands occurred throughout the study
period (Table 6). Notably, change in use of neighborhood and city streets decreased in Phase
3 to a level significantly less than those seen in Phases 1and 2. For all other designations,
decrease in use was significantly less profound in Phase 3, as opposed to Phases 1and/or 2.
This may indicate a migration away from neighborhood and city streets and back to public
lands, therefore reducing substitution behavior.

Reasons for changing outdoor recreation behaviors shifted throughout the study period
(Table 7). Barriers including access to transportation and the lack of friends and family to
recreate with became less prominent as the study period progressed. Barriers including
closed recreation areas and fear of COVID-19 exposure became more prominent throughout
the study period. Effect sizes are small, however.

**Bonferroni Correction utilized for multiple comparisons (p<0.01)

Developed scales utilized in all three phases were grounded in relevant academic literature
on psychosocial factors influencing outdoor recreation. This includes perceptions of risk
(Green et al., 2009; Reis et al., 2012), messages from authority (Marion & Reid, 2007), social
norms (Heberlein, 2012), health benefits (Kuo, 2015), and substitution processes (Hammit et
al., 2004). Reliability analyses during Phase 1showed all scales were appropriately reliable
with Cronbach's Alpha scores greater than 0.65 (Vaske, 2008). Furthermore, a confirmatory
factor analysis demonstrated appropriate fit with the following statistics: RMSEA=0.079;
SRMR=0.0594; CFl=0.902. Average ratings across corresponding single-item measures in
Table 8 were calculated to determine the scales displayed in Table 9. Spearman rank-order
correlation analysis with a Bonferroni Correction was utilized to determine trends across the
three points of measurement (Table 9). Social Norms, Orders from Authority, and
Substitution ratings were all negatively correlated with time across the three measurement
phases, implying individuals saw these factors as less important when making outdoor
recreation decisions as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed. There was no significant
change in ratings for Health Benefits and Perceived Risk across the three phases.

Respondents surveyed in Phases 2 and 3 were significantly more likely to perceive changes
in their long-term outdoor recreation behaviors than those surveyed during Phase 1(Table 11).
Of the specific behaviors included in the surveys, only changing types of outdoor recreation
saw significant differences between phases (Table 12). Effect sizes for both the omnibus and
