Title: Low quality, stigmatizing research prevents effective responses to covid-19

Abstract:

4

Evidence-based responses to covid-19 must be based on high-quality research. Low-quality research is

5

particularly dangerous when it feeds into stigmatizing narratives, including blaming immigrants for

6

spreading infection.

Studies about COVID-19 and immigrants are guaranteed media attention in Norway

10

In recent weeks, we have seen immigrants blamed for covid-19 infections, blame that is shaped by

11

broader (and stigmatizing) ideas attached to specific ethnic groups. A prescient example is The

12

Journal for the Norwegian Medical Association’s recent publication of “COVID-19 infections in

13

Oslo’s neighborhoods,” by Søegaard and Kan on 25 March 2021 (1). The authors conclude that

14

immigrant saturation alone, and not socioeconomic status or high-density residency, is a risk factor for

15

infection in Oslo. A thoughtful critique by Aambø was published parallel to the Søegaard and Kan

16

article (2). Aambø drew attention to the authors’ heavy explanatory focus on individual behavior over

17

established structural factors, such as the stress of discrimination, and the individual expression of

18

stress through allostatic load.

19
20

The choice to emphasize individual, rather than structural, factors to explain high infection rates

21

amongst immigrants is symptomatic of a larger problem of low methodological quality in much of the

22

recent covid-19 research -- and the destructive narratives such research bolsters. As early as May

23

2020, systematic reviewers raised flags about massive amounts of poor-quality primary research on

24

covid-19 that was being published at record speed (3). Health policymakers require high quality

25

evidence in order to design effective infection prevention and control strategies. In Søegaard and

26

Kan’s article, both the analysis and the conclusions are incorrect. We draw attention to three

27

particularly problematic areas.

28
29

Incorrect analyses

30

Søegaard and Kan choose to “predict” infection rates in Oslo neighborhoods by analyzing data on

31

three highly collinear (i.e. statistically similar, r = 0.9 for all) variables collected during the same time

32

period -- immigrant saturation, SES, and high-density residency, the latter combining overcrowding

33

and multiple-generation homes. There was no a priori hypothesis or analysis plan reported, no proof

34

that the authors were not simply “p-fishing”, no N reported of their independent variables, and it is not

35

clear the aggregate data they used are even describing the same people. By inputting three highly

36

related variables into the same regression, the authors essentially measure the same construct multiple

2

1

times, and the resulting over-fit model is incapable of differentiating the influence of one independent

2

variable over another. The classic risk of multicollinearity is that some variables will mistakenly

3

appear to be statistically insignificant in the resulting analysis, while a sole variables will appear

4

significant. In the case of Søegaard and Kan, two of the variables (SES and high-density housing)

5

appear insignificant and only one appears significant (immigration saturation). Despite acknowledging

6

that they have used statistically identical variables in their analysis, the authors nonetheless incorrectly

7

choose to report that immigrant saturation alone is correlated with infection, and that low SES and

8

high-density residency are not. In the most forgiving interpretation, Søegaard and Kan’s bivariate

9

analysis demonstrates unfortunate but unsurprising associations between infection and three similar

10

indicators of neighborhood deprivation: immigrant saturation, low SES, and high-density residency.

11
12

Discriminatory speculations

13

Second, Søegaard and Kan connect incorrect findings to spurious and stigmatizing conclusions. After

14

making an unfounded connection between immigrant saturation and infection, the authors suggest that

15

increased infection is in fact caused by (not only associated with) “cultural/ethnic background”, “other

16

norms for physical and social nearness”, and “systematic misunderstandings of infection and

17

containment measures”. Stated more directly, the authors, while having no basis in their data for such

18

a claim, suggest that Oslo neighborhoods with high immigrant saturation are infected because

19

immigrants do not understand hygiene or social distancing, and because they are ethnically and

20

culturally different. The authors have made an unquestionably discriminatory accusation against

21

different ethnic groups.

22
23

Dangerous policy implications

24

Third, the authors conclude by writing that they have “rapidly and simply identified associations that

25

can be useful for health authorities”. Herein lies the most problematic aspect of the research: it may

26

very well be used by policy makers. The logical policy response that follows from the study is to focus

27

on immigrant saturation, rather than other, underlying factors such as poverty and overcrowding. This

28

“immigrants drive infection” narrative was propagated by Norway’s major national and regional

29

media channels within 48 hours of journal publication (including Aftenposten, VG, Vårt Oslo, and

30

Nettavisen). In times of health crises, when it is necessary to quickly plan robust and effective public

31

health responses, it is essential that the evidence on which such responses are based use transparent

32

and appropriate analytical methods, and that they do not fall prey to stigmatizing explanations that

33

have no bearing in the data. We are surprised that Søegaard and Kan’s article was published.
