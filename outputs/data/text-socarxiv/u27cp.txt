If public health policies are to succeed they must receive support from the people they are designed to
help. This is especially true in democracies, where politicians are subject to periodic election and
therefore sensitive to cues from the electorate. However, electoral accountability is not automatic. It
exists only if citizens connect specific policies to politicians and vote accordingly. Do issues surrounding
public health move public opinion and do those opinions translate into voting behavior?
We know a fair bit about attitudes toward public health in rich countries, where health systems
are expansive and expensive, and especially in the United States, where health care is an intensely
partisan issue [1–13]. We know less about attitudes toward public health in the developing world, where
the topic is rarely studied [14]. In neither context is the opinion/behavior nexus well understood.
Although a few studies examine the association between public health attitudes and voting behavior
[15], it is difficult to infer causality from this sort of observational data.
The Covid-19 pandemic offers a unique opportunity to observe the interplay between public
opinions about public health and electoral politics. It is one of the worst epidemics of the modern era; it
is global in scope; it is covered intensively by the press; and the role of political leaders and parties in
mitigating or exacerbating the epidemic is front-and-center in news reportage. If public health matters
for popular politics, Covid-19 would seem to be a perfect storm.[16]
To assess the question, we launched surveys in the United States, the United Kingdom, and
India. Embedded within the surveys is a survey experiment in which we prime information about the
health and economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Research Design
The Covid-19 pandemic is global in reach, which means mass publics and politicians around the world
are confronted with similar challenges. Political responses differ, and exposure to the virus also differs
across countries. However, all citizens share the uncertainty of knowing that a massive number of
deaths – beyond anything experienced over the past century – is possible. In this general sense, the
Covid-19 threat is ubiquitous.
To gauge public opinion across the world an ideal research design would incorporate random
samples drawn from every country at regular intervals. We do not have the resources or the logistical
wherewithal to carry out such a massive undertaking. Nor is it possible in the midst of this highly
contagious epidemic to administer surveys person-to-person, which impedes the ability to recruit
random samples in many countries. For our purposes, it is also important to capture opinion in a country
at a point in time when the epidemic (as judged by infection and mortality rates) and public attention to
it (as judged by popular media accounts) is near its peak. We cannot wait for the pandemic to subside in
order to contact research subjects in a safe environment.
Accordingly, we employ a survey recruitment platform that is widely used for survey
experiments and which has a significant presence in select countries around the world: Amazon’s
Mechanical Turk, aka “M-Turk” [17]. For theoretical reasons, it is vital to include both rich and poor
countries. Accordingly, we selected three countries that cross the North/South divide and also provide a
significant contingent of M-Turk workers [18]: the United States, the United Kingdom, and India.
2

Power analyses suggested a sample size of 1,500 in each country, i.e., 500 for each arm of the
experiment. We were cognizant that the smaller numbers of Turkers in the UK might preclude reaching
a full sample in that country. However, the more important issue was obtaining sufficient samples in the
developed world (for which the UK and US could be considered together) and the developing world (for
which India would have to suffice).
Recruitment took place over several weeks, from 15 April to 6 May, 2020. The US quota was
quickly filled, while samples for the other countries took longer and were not entirely filled. The Indian
sample comprises 1,018 respondents and the UK sample 361 respondents. The survey was available in
English for all three countries and in English and Hindi for India. Survey respondents were compensated
through M-Turk according to rates that account for differences in purchasing power parity across the
three countries.
The resulting sample is younger, more male, and more educated than the general populations of
our three countries – a common pattern among M-Turk studies [18]. The India sample is also more
urban and better off than the general population. And, there are some regional imbalances with London
over-represented in the UK and southern states over-represented in the Indian sample. Further details
are provided in Appendix B.
To ascertain how the Covid-19 pandemic might be influencing political behavior we employ a
survey experiment in which key facts about the pandemic are revealed to respondents, followed by
questions intended to elicit attitudes toward the government and potential voting choices. 1 The first
treatment deals with the possible economic impact of the pandemic and the second concerns its
possible health impact. A filter question ensures that respondents comprehend the information that has
been presented to them and also serves to reinforce the initial stimulus. Thus, we construct an
experiment with two treatment groups and a control (which is given no information about the
pandemic). Outcome questions of theoretical interest inquire (a) whether respondents would support
the incumbent (party and party leader) if an election were held today and (b) whether they hold the
government at fault for allowing the disease to spread. Further details on the setup are contained in Box
1 and a complete questionnaire is provided in Appendix A.
Two hypotheses will guide our discussion. 2

H1: Respondents who receive either of the treatment conditions will offer greater – or
lesser – support for the incumbent relative to the control group.
H2: Respondents who receive either of the treatment conditions will be more inclined
to blame the government for their handling of the pandemic.
1

This follows a widely employed technique known as the survey experiment [19].

Initial research hypotheses centered on expected variation between the two treatments, as set forth in a detailed
pre-analysis plan, registered at E-Gap: http://egap.org/registration/6645. Finding no difference between the
treatments, we decided to focus this paper on the treatment/control comparison. However, it is important to note
that results from the pre-analysis plan are entirely consistent with results presented here: null findings obtain
throughout.
2

To test these hypotheses we adopt an experimental design, allowing us to make claims that
responses we find are elicited through exposure to the experiment—one of three mutually exclusive
scenarios. We estimate the impact through the following regression relations which include
confounding factors to yield greater precision:
𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑖𝑖 = 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝛼𝛼𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽 + 𝛾𝛾𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖

where Outcome is the measurement of the response to the scenario to which the person i was exposed,
denoted by T, SES denotes the socio-economic factors, C stands for demographic factors, and lastly,
there is the country indicator. Variants of this relation includes examination of heterogeneity in
response to different SES status through scenarios being interacted with SES factors.

Box 1: Experimental Design
The experiment consists of a pure control and two treatments. The first focuses on the projected
economic effects of the Coronavirus pandemic. The US version reads as follows:

As you are probably aware, the Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has spread around the
world. Experts are wrestling with the impact of this pandemic on the United States
economy. Some estimates suggest that the economy could shrink by 3.2% this year, that
52.8 million people could end up without work (around 32% of the entire workforce),
and that the value of stocks and shares could fall by around 30%.
Similar versions are constructed for the UK and India based on economic projections in those countries.
follows:

The second treatment focuses on the health effects of Covid-19. The US version reads as

As you are probably aware, the Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has spread around the
world. Experts are wrestling with the impact of this pandemic on public health in the
United States. One estimate suggests that around 12.9 million would require
hospitalization (3.9% of the population), around 3.7 million would need critical care, and
over 2.8 million people could die (around 0.8% of the population). At present, there is
no vaccine for Coronavirus and no cure.
Similar versions are constructed for the UK and India based on health projections for the virus in those
countries.
After each treatment, the respondent is asked a multiple-choice question about the information
presented in the previous page. For example, after the health treatment US respondents might be
asked:

What is the estimated number of fatalities from Covid-19 in the USA, as stated on the
previous page? (If you are not sure, check back on the previous page.)
a) It was more than 2 million people
b) It was less than 2 million people
Follow-up questions are constructed so that the correct answer is the highest – (a) rather than (b) – so
as to enhance the strength of the treatment. Respondents must answer this follow-up question
correctly in order to proceed through the survey.
Two outcome questions gauge the possible impact of these treatments on political behavior.
The first centers on the incumbent: “If a national election were held today, would you like to see
[Johnson and the Conservative party/Trump and the Republican party/Modi and the BJP] reelected? The
second asks whether the government is at fault for allowing the pandemic to spread. Responses are
registered on a 100-point feeling thermometer.
5

Results
To ascertain whether the experiment is effective in priming attitudes, we ask several questions. First, we
inquire about the (subjective) importance of two prominent policy areas: public health and the
economy. Each is gauged on a 100-point feeling thermometer. An index is then constructed by
subtracting views on the importance of public health from views about the importance of the economy
(which functions as a baseline). Second, we ask about worries with respect to the health and economic
effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Again, we compose an index by subtracting worries about health from
worries about economics (which also functions as a baseline).
Results of these analyses, shown in Figures 1a and 1b, indicate that both treatment conditions
boost the salience of public health relative to the economy and make people more worried about the
health effects of Covid-19. Moreover, the pure health treatment produces a stronger effect than the
treatment focused on the economic effects of Covid-19, as one would expect if the experiment is
working as designed.

Figure 1a: Salience

Notes: Point estimates represent marginal effects and vertical bars are the 95% confidence intervals.
Each person is asked about how important they think each policy (health and economy) is on a scale
of 0 to 100 (with 100 representing very important). We then calculate the difference (health –
conomy). The full scale of this measure ranges from -100 to 100. Economic condition vs Control: β =
2.2, p = 0.019. Health condition vs Control: β = 3.3, p = 0.001.

Figure 1b: Worry

Notes: Point estimates represent marginal effects and vertical bars are the 95% confidence intervals.
Each person is asked about how worried they are about the economic and health effects of Covid-19
on a scale of 0 to 100 (with 100 representing that they are very worried). We then calculate the
difference (health – economy). The full scale of this measure ranges from -100 to 100. Economic
condition vs Control: β = 2.3, p = 0.173. Health condition vs Control: β = 4.4, p = 0.010.

However, our theoretical interest is not in salience or worry. We want to know whether the
Covid-19 pandemic has electoral repercussions. For this to occur, salience must be combined with views
about the ruling party and the sitting government, as contained in our two outcome questions (see Box
1). These tests are presented in Figures 2 and 3.
It will be seen that neither treatment demonstrates an appreciable effect on either outcome.
This generates four null results – a consistent pattern in which treatments designed to heighten the
subject’s awareness of the economic and health dangers of the Covid-19 epidemic fail to change their
support for the ruling party or their inclination to place blame at the feet of the government.

Figure 2: Incumbent Support

Notes: Point estimates represent marginal effects and vertical bars are the 95% confidence intervals.
Each person is asked about how they would feel if the incumbent in each country was reelected on a
scale of 0 to 100 (with 100 representing they would be very happy). None of the treatment conditions
in any country had a p-value less than 0.1.

8

Figure 3: Government at Fault

Notes: Point estimates represent marginal effects and vertical bars are the 95% confidence intervals.
Each person is asked about whether the government is at fault for the spread of Covid-19 on a scale
of 0 to 100 (with 100 representing strong agreement). None of the conditions had a p-value less than
0.05 and only one had a p-value less than 0.1. In the US, the economic condition versus control: β = 3.3, p = 0.076.

Null results are often more difficult to interpret than positive results, so we shall spend some
time considering what the findings represented in Figures 2 and 3 might mean. Does it mean that the
Covid-19 pandemic has no political consequences, as we have suggested, or that our experiment is
poorly designed?
Our experiment primes an existing condition that is well-known to the participants, and also
highly salient. Under the circumstances, it may be difficult to move the dial, as research subjects are
already saturated with information. However, results displayed in Figure 1 demonstrate that the
experiment did affect salience and worry (when public health is gauged vis-à-vis economics), which
serves as a negative placebo.
More generally, we doubt that the fear and uncertainty surrounding Covid-19 is so great that it
would resist a further stimulus, provided by our – very pointed – reminder of its possible consequences.
Arguably, it should be the reverse. If people are already aware of a problem, a reminder of that problem
should stimulate those concerns by making them manifest. (By contrast, a less well-known or less
virulent health problem might not be perceived by subjects as a credible threat.)
A null finding may also result if respondents hold an extreme position, as measured by the
outcome; they are at one end or the other. For such “extremists,” there may be no way to measure the
9

impact of the treatment. This concern is mitigated by our response variable, a 100-point feeling
thermometer. Still, thirty percent of our sample (863 of 2,913) sits at the extremes of the scale (at 0 or
100) for the incumbency question (Figure 2), and eleven percent of the sample (325 of 2,913) sit at the
extremes of the scale for the government-at-fault question (Figure 3). A simple expedient is to remove
these extremists from the analysis. Doing so reveals a treatment effect (for both the economics and
health treatment conditions) that is even closer to zero than what is recorded in Figures 2 and 3. Our
null effects do not appear to be driven by a truncated scale.
A null finding may also result from causal heterogeneity, when a treatment has disparate effects
– sometimes positive, sometimes negative – on subjects depending upon their background conditions.
One obvious background condition is the country context. One can easily imagine that the Covid-19
pandemic might be experienced differently in the US, UK, and India. However, Figures 2-3 demonstrate
that this is not the case.
Background conditions of individual subjects are, in principle, infinite. Our post-survey
questionnaire inquired about gender, age, urban/rural location, employment status, educational
attainment, income, money saved for emergencies, and current health status. Split-sample tests
focusing on subjects who fall into different categories along these various dimensions do not reveal any
significant effects (see Tables C1-C2), with one notable exception. High SES subjects in the treatment
groups may be more inclined to exercise an anti-incumbent vote than those in the control group, as
shown in Figure C1. However, this differential response by social class does not carry over to faulting the
government, and may be a stochastic artifact. Further research will be needed in order to assess
whether citizens with higher than average income are more responsive to health policy cues.

Generalizability
With experiments there are often questions about generalizability. In the present instance, one may
wonder whether results contained in Figures 2 and 3 are indicative of the outcome of theoretical
concern – election-day behavior.
With “positive” treatment effects, generalizability would be more of a concern. After all, talk is
cheap: responses to a survey have no consequences for the respondent, while in an election there is
something important at stake. But there is no reason to suppose that the cheapness of talk would be
conducive to null results. If anything, the reverse seems more likely.
A second concern is the time separation between our experiment and the arrival of the next
national elections, which are not imminent in any of our three countries (half a year in the US and
several years in the UK and India). Since public sentiments wax and wane according to many factors that
are impossible to predict, effects associated with Covid-19 uncovered in the midst of a pandemic may
dissipate once the pandemic subsides. However, dissipation also seems more of a problem for a
“positive” finding than a null finding. There is little reason to suppose that the political ramifications of
Covid-19 would increase between now – the height of the crisis (or nearly so) in the three countries
under observation – and the next election.

10

A third issue of generalizability concerns whether the control group is entirely a control. Covid19 is so dominant that even the control group are aware of the possible health effects of the virus.
However, the salience of the issue has changed over the period of our data collection. For example, the
UK total number of deaths has risen from 14,000 on the day data collection started to ~28,000 on the
final day of the survey. India’s death rose from 377 to over 1,500 across this same period. If public
awareness of Covid-19 is contaminating our control group we might expect the control group to change
over time as the death toll rises, but this is not what we see in the data, suggesting that whatever
impact Covid-19 has had on voters it is again unaffected by the steadily rising death toll in both
countries. For the UK and India – the two countries for which data was collected over several weeks –
we see no change in the null effect when the samples are limited to surveys completed at different
times (see Figure C2).
A fourth issue concerns the representativeness of our sample of M-Turkers. In addition to
problems of self-selection, M-Turkers differ along standard demographic dimensions when compared
with national populations, as noted. Some of them may be “professional” survey respondents, and many
(about three-quarters) have participated in previous surveys about Covid-19. To check whether these
factors influenced the receptiveness of our sample to the experimental treatments we replicated the
analyses pictured in Figures 2-3 across subgroups – defined by those who have, or have not, taken
previous surveys related to Covid-19 (according to self-report). Null results obtain among each
subgroup.
The one background factor that may affect responsiveness in this experiment is socioeconomic
status. Specifically, high-SES respondents are more likely to register an anti-incumbent vote (Figure C1).
If this is a real effect (instead of a stochastic effect stemming from a small sample), samples drawn from
the general population (which would include fewer high-SES respondents) should be even less
responsive to the treatment, reinforcing our null results.
Another issue of generalizability concerns our choice of study sites. Are null results in the US,
UK, and India likely to be replicable in other contexts? This is much harder to assess. However, the US
and the UK are among the countries most affected by the Covid-19 health pandemic; in this respect
their background circumstances are propitious. That India has been less affected (as of May 2020) offers
a point of contrast. That the null finding persists across all three contexts suggests that these results
might be generalizable.
Our three research sites also offer variation on another background condition of potential
importance. In the US, the Covid-19 epidemic has been subject to partisan politics, with a president who
downplays its seriousness and has been widely faulted for a weak and inconsistent response to the
public health threat. In the UK and India, partisan politics have also been at play, but not in such a
prominent fashion. Again, it should be stressed that all three countries register a robust null result.
One may also question whether findings with respect to an epidemic are generalizable to
“normal” public health issues such as the perennial tussle over government’s role in health care, the
performance of government health services, and their expense. Here, we have no grounds for
speculation. It could be that the extreme nature of Covid-19, and its seemingly irresistible global spread,
have inoculated politicians from blame. Further research will be needed in order to determine whether
other, more mundane, health concerns carry a stronger political punch.
11

Discussion
People in the US, UK, and India are extremely concerned about the pandemic – both its health effects
and economic repercussions – and they become even more concerned when primed with information
about the repercussions of the virus (see Figure 1). Yet, we find no evidence that these worries translate
into changes in political behavior (see Figures 2-3).
Several reasons may be adduced for this (unexpected) null finding. It could be that public health
is not viewed as a political issue but rather as a matter of personal conduct, group status, or
socioeconomic standing. It could be that members of the public view public health policies through
partisan lenses, which means that it is largely endogenous. (It is worth noting, however, that a recent
survey experiment situated in the US found no impact on attitudes toward Covid-19 when partisan cues
were primed.)[16,20] It could be that the global nature of the Covid-19 pandemic has inoculated
politicians from blame.
Whatever mechanisms might be at work, the null findings contained in this study suggest that
politicians are unlikely to be punished or rewarded for their failures or successes in managing Covid-19
in the next election. One is tempted to conclude that public health issues have little influence on voter
preferences in most election cycles. It is not clear, for example, that the depression in life expectancies
in the US, the continuing underperformance of NHS in the UK, and the low-level of public sector health
expenditure in India has had much impact on elections in those countries. The urgency by which the
Covid-19 pandemic has ripped through social, economic and political landscapes may challenge these
complacencies. But only if mass publics make connections between the state of public health and what
public officials can do. We need more research on how these factors interact, and to the extent that
they are disconnected, why this might be so.
If public health is politically inconsequential this also raises questions about the impact of
political institutions on health outcomes. Most studies suggest a positive relationship between
democracy and improved public health proxied by mortality.[21–26]. Generally, this is attributed to
electoral accountability.[27,28] Democracies hold free and fair elections and these institutions make
politicians more responsive to the preferences of citizens, which are thought to prioritize health.[29–32]
Our results suggest that this commonsensical argument may be flawed. Democracies may promote
health, but perhaps for reasons other than electoral accountability.
There are many potential implications from this study. At the same time, we want to caution
against drawing big conclusions from a single experiment conducted in an exploratory manner. We
noted potential problems of generalizability in the previous section. In particular, our M-Turk samples
are not randomly drawn from their respective populations. It is possible that different results would be
obtained with randomly chosen samples. There is also the question of our choice of country cases,
which include only three countries and whose representativeness of the world of nation-states may be
questioned. There is, finally, a question about the policy itself; there may be features of Covid-19 that do
not generalize to other health outcomes. These issues warrant further research.

University of Oxford. This study is being conducted in a number of countries and you have been invited
to participate because you live in the United States.
Why are we doing this research study? The purpose of this research study is to understand your opinions
about current events, and how they are affecting our lives.
Who can participate in this research study? Anyone can participate in this study as long as they are from
US.
What will I be asked to do and how much time will it take? If you agree to take part in this study, you will
be asked to complete a short online survey. This survey will ask about your knowledge of and opinions
about current events, and it will take you approximately 5 minutes to complete.
What are my risks of being in this research study? There are no risks to you by participating this
research. There will be no inconveniences to you other than the time you spend answering the
questions. All data will be anonymous and confidential.
How will my personal information be protected? MTurk protects your anonymity and so it will be
impossible for anyone to identify who you are. All the questions we are planning to ask are general, such
as age and sex, and will therefore be too general to ever identify anyone.
You must be of legal age to participate in this study.
If you have any questions, please contact the study lead at aaron.reeves@spi.ox.ac.uk

Figure C1: SES Subgroup Analysis

We constructed this measure of socio-economic position using latent class analysis (LCA) of the
categorical measures of income, education, and savings. A three-class model fit the data well (p < 0.01),
distinguishing between an affluent (32%), middle-class (50%), and less affluent group (18%). We then
assigned individuals to the latent class for which they had the highest posterior probability.
