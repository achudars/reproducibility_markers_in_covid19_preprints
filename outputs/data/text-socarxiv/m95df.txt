Abstract
This paper evaluates the inequalities in employment trajectories during the first
COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Germany. We assess individual-level panel data
collected weekly between 20 March and 25 June (N=2,297), which allows us to
examine the risks of short-time work, furlough, and job loss, as well as changes
between working on-site and from home. Using sequence analysis, we detect
typical patterns of employment trajectories and analyse how these vary between
socio-demographic groups. Finally, we relate the types of employment trajectories
to changes in income, subjective job security (compared to values in January and
February 2020), and COVID-19 infection risks. Our results show clear gradients in
employment risks: low-wage workers were severely affected by furlough and job
loss, while highly qualified employees were able to work from home. Furthermore,
in contrast to previous crises, service sector and female employees were more
affected by short-time work; however, its timing and duration differs compared to
male workers in manufacturing. Income loss was pronounced among those who
became unemployed and those continuously in short-term work, while
everybody—including employees continuously working from home—experienced
a significant reduction in subjective job security compared to employees whose
employment hours or location have not changed. The infection risk was only
increased for individuals who changed from furlough to working on-site.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic and the containment measures have had fundamental and
immediate effects on economies and labour markets all over the world (Daly et al.,
2020; Lejeune, 2020). Its employment consequences are not fully understood yet, and
seem to differ from those of previous recessions, also due to the service sector, and
especially women, being disproportionally affected (Alon et al., 2020; Anger et al.,
2020; Blundell et al., 2020; Möhring et al., 2020; Naumann et al., 2020). The pandemic
and the containment measures have introduced three main changes to individuals’
working lives, each of which has potentially tremendous consequences for employees.
First, many companies have experienced a loss of revenue and orders since the onset of
the pandemic. The main social policy instrument to avoid mass lay-offs during
economic crises in Germany is the short-time work arrangement, which allows
companies to reduce their employees’ working hours and wages in times of economic
hardship or when production is impaired. A government earnings replacement scheme
then compensates the wage loss partially (Konle-Seidl, 2020; Wachter, 2020). In a
second change, the pandemic represents the greatest homeworking experiment in
history (Felstead and Reuschke, 2020), as many companies in Germany and other
countries switched to remote working and obliged their employees to work from home.
Third, a widespread (but less regulated) response to the pandemic has been to suspend
employees—so-called furlough. Furloughed workers in Germany do not receive any
government earnings replacement to compensate for their loss of income.
Our study analyses inequality in employment trajectories, covering all three
changes and their consequences for employees. It draws on weekly information on the
employment situation of individuals in Germany that covers the first COVID-19
lockdown and several weeks after. The data come from a special COVID-19 survey
3

carried out as part of the German Internet Panel (GIP), which is a representative
longitudinal survey of the German population (Blom et al., 2015, 2020). In a first step,
we use sequence analysis to identify patterns of employment trajectories during the
early phase of the pandemic and their distribution among the workforce according to
socio-demographic characteristics. In a second step, we relate the identified types of
employment trajectories to consequences for perceived job security, income, and
infection risk. Thereby, we address three main questions related to employment
inequality in a pandemic recession. What were the dynamics of typical employment
pathways in the early phase of the crisis? Which groups in the labour market have been
most affected in terms of their working life, income, and infection risk? How do
employment transitions translate into feelings of insecurity? To the best of our
knowledge, our study is the first to use detailed weekly longitudinal data to analyse how
employment trajectories and related inequalities have evolved during the first COVID19 lockdown period.
The article is organised as follows. We first set out the theoretical background
and place our analysis in the wider frame of research on the dualization of labour
markets. This includes describing the segmentation of Germany’s pre-pandemic labour
market and the government’s crisis measures. We next describe the data set, the
operationalisation of variables, and the methods applied. We then present the results and
discuss the implications for further research and social policy.

Background
Labour market inequality and policies in Germany
Germany has a coordinated market economy with a labour market and labour laws that
have traditionally provided a high level of protection for employees, which created a

4

high-wage and low-inequality economy during the post-war period (Bothfeld, 2007;
DiPrete, 2016; Hall and Soskice, 2001). In recent decades, however, the country’s
labour market has become increasingly polarised between a primary sector that offers
high employment protection and high earnings on the one hand, and a secondary sector
with insecure employment relationships and low wages on the other hand
(Emmenegger, 2012; Garz, 2013; Schwander and Häusermann, 2013). Labour market
inequality increased since the early 1990s due to an expanding low-wage sector and
growing disparities between educational groups (Dustmann et al., 2009), and further
intensified after the labour market reforms of the early 2000s, which included the
flexibilisation of the low-wage sector and cuts in earnings-replacement benefits for
long-term unemployed persons (Eichhorst and Marx, 2011). These changes caused
inequality to rise further, especially due to increased polarisation between full-time and
part-time employees in terms of wages and job security, de facto constituting a gender
divide as mostly women work part time in Germany (Bosch and Weinkopf, 2008;
Brülle et al., 2018; Häusermann and Schwander, 2012). As a consequence, Germany
currently has one of the highest shares of the female workforce in low-wage
employment in Europe (Eurostat, 2020).
The link between institutional divides embedded in the social security system
and inequality in union coverage have reinforced the dualization of the German
workforce (Hassel, 2014). While workers in the industrial sector are covered by union
agreements that guarantee steady pay rises and job protection, low-wage workers in the
service sector are poorly protected outsiders. Stagnating wages in the service sector
compared to manufacturing since the 1970s have also contributed to these polarisations;
relative wage losses have been especially pronounced in the hospitality sector. As
Hassel (2014: p. 72) explains:

5

[…] manufacturing and low skilled service sector firms now work under
different institutional regimes. Manufacturing is organized around a body of
skilled high productivity core workers which is protected against economic
insecurity. Low skilled services operate under conditions that are similar to
labour markets in liberal market economies.
In summary, the main divisions in the German workforce are gender and level of
education, which is partly mirrored in divergencies between economic sectors (Hassel,
2014; Häusermann and Schwander, 2012).
Yet, the polarisation on the German labour market goes beyond the servicemanufacturing divide, constituting a division in three segments. First, the unstructured
segment includes low-skilled positions filled by employees with no vocational or
university qualifications and typically follow highly volatile job trajectories with short
tenures and frequent job changes (Blossfeld and Mayer, 1988; Kalina, 2012). These jobs
are typically located in the secondary segment of the service and industrial sector,
including low service functionaries and blue-collar workers (Schwander and
Häusermann, 2013). Second, the occupational segment corresponds with the structure of
the vocational training system and offers jobs following a technical (e.g., skilled craft
workers) or organizational (e.g., routine office workers) work logic. Third, high-skilled
professionals and managers in the primary segment of internal labour markets typically
enjoy well-paid, secure employment relationships with access to internal career ladders
and seniority-based payment. This internal segment includes experts and executives in
large manufacturing companies, public administration, and in the service sector, e.g. in
information and technology (Häusermann and Schwander, 2012; Kalina, 2012).

Government crisis measures
Crisis measures such as the short-time work benefits have a long-standing tradition in
Germany and have been successful at preventing mass lay-offs in previous economic
crises. The goal of short-time work is to enable employers to reduce their employees’
working hours without having to lay them off in the event of an economic downturn or
temporary loss of orders (Wachter, 2020). Employers, rather than individual employees,
apply for this short-time work status; working hours can be reduced flexibly, and can
even be set to zero. The short-time work benefit compensates for 60 percent of
employees’ earnings losses (67 percent for those with children) based on their previous
net income (Konle-Seidl, 2020). This benefit is intended to be a temporary measure,
restricted to a maximum duration of 12 months; its success therefore depends on how
long the economic crisis lasts (Fischer and Schmid, 2020).
Rueda (2012, 2014) argues that government crisis measures align with existing
divisions in the labour market. Labour market insiders not only have a better position,
as they typically work in higher-paying, more secure jobs; they also enjoy better
protection in the social security system. Importantly, workers in low-wage employment
up to 450 Euro monthly pay are not eligible for the short-time work benefit, nor are
previously subcontracted workers usually eligible, but in the pandemic crisis the shorttime work allowance has been temporarily expanded to include the latter.
Germany suffered fewer job losses during the Great Recession than many other
countries (Rinne and Zimmermann, 2012). The negative consequences of the crisis were
rather short term and mainly concentrated in male-dominated, export-oriented industrial
sectors, such as the automotive industry. The short-time work policy described above
helped prevent mass lay-offs in the industrial sector, as did other state subsidies
designed to boost domestic demand (Burda and Hunt, 2011). By contrast, employment
in the service sector increased even in the core crisis years, which involved rising
7

employment rates of women in part-time and atypical employment (Kirchmann and
Rosemann, 2010). Hence, the government crisis measures’ focus on male-dominated
sectors did not have further consequences at that time.
The German federal government has adopted several measures to lessen the
employment effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. It prolonged the short-time work
benefits to up to 24 months or the end of 2021 and enacted a temporary increase to 70
percent (77 percent) of the net wage after four months and 80 percent (87 percent) after
seven months (BMAS, 2020). A public aid package including direct payments for
companies that experienced income shortfalls was launched during the spring
lockdown. Nevertheless, the economic aid package has been criticised for again largely
focusing on male-dominated sectors of the economy (Wiesner, 2020).

Vulnerability in the COVID-19 pandemic
When analysing social inequality in employment during the pandemic, in addition to
economic vulnerability, which includes negative consequences such as job loss or
reduction of working hours and earnings (Schwander and Häusermann, 2013), health
vulnerability has to be considered, namely the risk of COVID-19 infection. Therefore,
individuals’ ability to determine their working arrangements constitutes a central aspect
of inequality. This applies first and foremost to the choice of the work location. For
employees with care responsibilities, having the flexibility to determine their working
time becomes more relevant in a pandemic crisis with schools and day cares closed.
First, we explore how the distribution of economic risks throughout the
workforce during a pandemic crisis differs from previous economic recessions. Due to
the sudden introduction of containment measures in March 2020, jobs in the service
sector that involve personal contact (restaurant and hospitality sector, retail, culture and
entertainment sector, and household-related services) were suspended. The use of the
8

short-time work benefit is limited in these fields due to the large number of ineligible
employees and self-employed sole traders in precarious positions. Therefore, the
pandemic has hit employees in precarious service sector positions especially hard
(Grabka et al., 2020). While manufacturing was not affected by the immediate
shutdown, the implementation of containment measures in factories may narrow
production capacities. The mid- and long-term consequences for the industrial sector
depend on the development of domestic demand and export, i.e. on how much
consumption in Germany and on worldwide markets declines during the crisis.
Consumption of products may increase as demand for services decreases as a result of
the stay-at-home policies. Therefore, it is likely that employees in the service sector,
especially low-wage workers, experienced more immediate and more severe harm than
in previous crises. With respect to more long-term consequences of the employment
distortions induced by the pandemic recession, early research for the UK and Germany
shows that short-time work and furlough are associated with poorer prospects for future
job security (Adams‐Prassl, Boneva, et al., 2020; Möhring et al., 2020).
Second, we have to ask how the infection risk as second dimension of
vulnerability is distributed in the workforce. Employees’ ability to determine their own
working time and location is greatest among the highly qualified workforce in the
internal segment of the service sector. Workers in the occupational segment often
perform tasks that cannot be done remotely (Adams-Prassl et al., 2020; Felstead and
Reuschke, 2020). Furthermore, research on remote work before the pandemic
highlighted gender differences: women generally have fewer opportunities to work from
home even when it would be technically possible (Lott and Abendroth, 2020). Early
analyses on potential vs. actual homeworking during the pandemic have shown that the
chances of homeworking are indeed unevenly distributed among the workforce: highly
9

qualified employees are more likely to work from home (Adams-Prassl et al., 2020;
Felstead and Reuschke, 2020). Although the group of homeworkers is still selective,
selectivity may have been reduced during the lockdown given that the containment
measures were imposed with little or no notice. For example, early research on working
from home during the pandemic suggests that the previous gender gap seems to have
narrowed (Möhring et al. 2020). However, it is unclear how sustainable these changes
are. Therefore, from a long-term perspective, inequality might also emerge from the
pace of returning to work on-site after containment measures are eased.

Hypotheses
As in previous crises, labour market insiders are less vulnerable to negative employment
outcomes than outsiders. The economic decline in the current pandemic crisis will lead
firms to first lay off employees in the “unstructured segment” of the labour market, in
both the industrial and service sectors. Workers in the internal segment, who have
greater flexibility to determine their work arrangements, will have more possibilities to
work from home during the lockdown. Therefore, we assume that those with lower
educational degrees and in low-wage employment are most affected by the negative
consequences of the crisis (that is, being in short-term work or furloughed), while those
with higher educational degrees and high wages are more able to work from home
(Hypothesis 1).
In contrast to the Great Recession, the service sector has been at least as hard hit
as the industrial sector and has experienced negative consequences much more
immediately due to the containment measures in the current pandemic crisis. This has
implications for the effect on gender inequalities, as more women work in the service
sector. Therefore, we expect that women are hit by the crisis effects earlier and are

10

equally affected as men by the negative consequences of the pandemic (Hypothesis 2).
However, since in the service sector more employees are in marginal employment and
are thus not eligible to receive short-time work benefits, the crisis effects in the two
sectors might still differ. Therefore, we assume that short-term work is most often used
in the occupational segment of the labour market, while low-wage employees face
higher risks of furlough and job loss (Hypothesis 3).
We also expect the consequences of the crisis to diverge in terms of timing for
different groups in the labour market. Highly qualified workers from the internal
segment will have greater long-term access to compensation and protection from the
state or government, while others will be more exposed to the ups and downs of the
crisis. Therefore, we assume that short-time work and furlough in the unstructured
segment of the service sector is more transient (Hypothesis 4) and that among those
initially working from home, less qualified employees and women return more quickly
to working on-site (Hypothesis 5).
With respect to the economic and health outcomes of employment trajectories
during the first lockdown, we expect that being affected by short-term work and
especially furlough leads to a decrease in subjective job security, while subjective job
security should be the same between employees working on-site vs. from home
(Hypothesis 6). The infection risk should be highest among those who continuously
work on-site (Hypothesis 7).

Materials and methods
Data and operationalisation
We use data from the GIP, which is based on a random probability sample of the
general population of Germany aged 16 to 75. The panel started in 2012 and was

11

supplemented with additional participants in 2014 and 2018. The panel participants
were recruited offline using strict statistical procedures (Blom et al. 2015). Every other
month, panel participants are invited to take part in a voluntary online survey. The GIP
launched a special survey on 20 March 2020 to gather data about the COVID-19
pandemic. GIP panelists were invited to take surveys every week. In the descriptive
analysis we use weights to account for attrition and non-response in this special
pandemic survey (compared to the usual GIP sample) and apply weights to extrapolate
participants’ characteristics to those of Germany’s general population based on age,
gender, marital status, highest level of education, household size, and federal state. We
include only individuals who were employed in January 2020 and are below 68 years
old (N=2,297).
We operationalise the employment situation based on information on
employment status and location of work and differentiate five categories: work usual
hours on-site, work usual hours from home, short-time work, furlough, and
unemployment. Please note that in the German context, only those in short-term work
are eligible for state top-up benefits as described above; furlough means being
suspended from work without receiving state benefits (unlike Britain’s temporary
furlough scheme; Adams‐Prassl, Boneva, et al., 2020). Furloughed employees,
however, may receive continued pay from their employer.
As explanatory variables for the cluster composition we include gender (female,
reference category: male); a dummy variable for migration background (no German
citizenship or not born in Germany); and a dummy variable for poor health based on
subjective health status (reference category: partly good/partly bad, good, excellent
health). To measure educational degree we distinguish between low (without or with
basic school-leaving qualification), middle (intermediate school-leaving qualification),

12

and high (higher education entrance qualification). In addition, we divide occupational
sectors into three categories (industry, service, public administration/education/health,
other) and personal net income into three categories (below 1,000 Euro, 1,000–2,500
Euro, above 2,500 Euro). These income categories refer to the 25 and 75 percent
quartiles of the income distribution in the GIP, yet this is a rough estimate as income
was measured in 15 categories. All variables are measured before the onset of the
pandemic.
As cluster outcomes we consider the change in household income between
February and June 2020, the change in self-assessed unemployment risk between
January and July 2020, and COVID-19 infection. Household income is a continuous
measure composed of 15 categories; income changes are operationalised as household
income in June subtracted from household income in February. Respondents’ future job
security is operationalised with their subjective assessment of the likelihood of job loss
in the next 12 months; the measure is composed of five categories ranging from very
low to very high. We use the change in this indicator operationalised with the value
from early July subtracted from the value measured before the onset of the pandemic in
January. The measure of COVID-19 infection is composed of two elements. The first is
a question asking whether the respondent had received a confirmed positive test result.
The second was a question to everybody who had not taken a test asking them to
subjectively assess whether they had been infected. We combine positive test results
(weighted 1.69 percent of the sample) with the answer “Yes, I am pretty sure” from the
second question (weighted 1.07 percent of the sample) to operationalise a confirmed or
very likely COVID-19 infection (N=52). Appendix Table A.1 provides an overview of
all variables.

Methods
Our analysis proceeds in three steps. We first apply sequence analysis to obtain a
holistic understanding of the employment trajectories between 20 March and 25 June
2020. This method is used to assess the (dis-)similarity of trajectories in order to
identify and visualise typical groups (Abbott, 1995). We treat respondents’ employment
trajectories as sequences with 14 elements, representing the 14 weeks of our observation
window, which are categorised as one of five employment states. Applying an optimal
matching algorithm with Dynamic-Hamming distances and a cost structure based on
empirical transition probabilities leads to an element-wise comparison of each possible
sequence pair in the data. The resulting dissimilarity matrix serves as the input for a
hierarchical cluster analysis (Piccarreta and Billari, 2007). Here, we identify eight
distinct clusters of employment trajectories. Sequence and cluster analysis were applied
in R, utilising the TraMineR package (Gabadinho et al., 2011).
To analyse the composition of the employment trajectory clusters—in other
words, to determine which socio-demographic characteristics are associated with cluster
membership—we use multinomial logistic regression models with the sequence clusters
as the dependent variables. We apply the same type of regression models to analyse the
outcomes of the clusters, with independent variables measured at the end of our
observation window.

Results
Descriptive overview
Figure 1 illustrates how the weekly employment situation of those who were in gainful
employment in January 2020 changed over the course of the lockdown. The main phase
of the first lockdown started with contact restrictions on 22 March, which included an

14

immediate shutdown of restaurants, shops—apart from grocery stores—and recreation
and similar personalised services. Gatherings and cultural events were banned, and only
meetings with members of one’s own household or with one person from another
household were allowed. The containment measures were relaxed starting on 6 May to
allow shops and restaurants to reopen; leisure sports and recreational activities were
allowed again. A lighter version of the contact restrictions was in place until 5 June.
Schools and day care facilities were completely closed from 13 March and reopened
stepwise at different time points in the federal states between late April and early May.
Schools did not completely reopen until June; in some federal states they reopened after
the summer break. Day care centres were mostly closed until at least mid-June.

Despite these unprecedented measures, the majority of employed persons
continued to work their usual hours, on-site, during the whole observation window: the
percentage increased from around 50 percent in late March and early April to 70 percent
in late June. A quarter of employees were working from home during the early phase of
the lockdown, which represents a significant increase from before the onset of the
pandemic: in January 2020 only around 11 percent of employees worked from home at
least part of the time. In the week of 20–26 March, 3.4 percent of employees reported
that they were receiving the government short-time work allowance; this number
climbed to over 12 percent in mid-May. In the following weeks, the share of short-time
work decreased again to around 7 percent at the end of our observation window. The
downward trend in short-time work coincides with the reopening of shops and
restaurants in late April. During the first weeks of the lockdown, 10–14 percent of those
employed in January were furloughed; of them around one-third were suspended
without pay; the rest received continued pay. Furlough was mainly a transitional state,
as the share dropped to below 2 percent in late June. The share of people who have lost
their job since January 2020 has remained below 5 percent. As 3.27 percent of the
workforce in Germany becomes unemployed over a three-month span in usual times,
these transitions may not be entirely attributed to the pandemic (Sozialpolitik-aktuell,
2020a, 2020b).

The majority (Cluster 1; N= 1,040) continued to work on-site. The second-largest group
almost continuously worked from home (Cluster 2; N=471), and a smaller fraction
changed from remote work to working on-site during the middle of the observation
period (Cluster 3; N=205). Those working continuously or initially from home mainly
have a high educational degree and high pay before the outbreak of the pandemic,
whereas those continuously working on-site in Cluster 1 mainly have a vocational
degree and medium pay. Low-wage workers are underrepresented in all three clusters.
Four further clusters contain individuals who had reduced working hours or
completely interrupted working. Individuals in Cluster 4 (N=178) were continuously in
short-time work until the end of the observation period, but changed to this status
somewhat later than those in Cluster 5. Cluster 5 (N=88) of transitional short-time work
contains individuals who changed to short-time work immediately after the onset of the
lockdown, and then returned to their usual working hours in early May. Both short-time
clusters deviate strongly in their gender and sectoral composition. While the share of
female workers is average in the cluster of transitional short-time work (Cluster 5),
which is roughly evenly distributed between industry and the service sector, female
representation is very much below average in the cluster of continuous short-time work
(Cluster 4), which mainly affects industrial sector workers. Both clusters also differ in
their educational composition: while both clusters contain mainly workers with
occupational degrees, people in the lowest educational group are overrepresented in the
cluster of transitional short-time, but underrepresented in the cluster of continuous
short-time.
People who were furloughed during the observation period are included in
Clusters 6 and 7. Individuals in Cluster 6 (N=97) were continuously on furlough, while
those in Cluster 7 (N=134) were in transitional furlough, returning to their usual

19

working hours in about early May. The share of female workers is above average in
both furlough clusters, and both contain above-average shares of workers with
previously low earnings. The continuous furlough cluster is highly polarised in terms of
educational composition, as it features above-average shares of employees in the lowest
and highest educational groups. This cluster also has a higher mean age and an above
average share of individuals with poor health, indicating that people at a higher risk of
severe illness in case of COVID-19 infection accumulate in this cluster.
Lastly, Cluster 8 (N=84) contains individuals who are or became unemployed
during the course of the lockdown. Nearly all of those individuals transitioned to
unemployment at or shortly after the onset of the lockdown, or in the time between the
GIP interview in January and the first interview of the COVID-19 survey at the end of
March. Therefore, the majority of these transitions into unemployment may not be
attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Multivariate analysis of cluster composition
We use multivariate analysis, with the clusters as dependent variables, to assess the
relationship between different characteristics of the cluster composition. For example,
we explore whether the overrepresentation of men or women in some clusters can be
explained by their sectoral composition. Figure 3 and Appendix Table A.2 report the
results of the multinomial logit models, the figure focuses on selected coefficients.
Cluster 1, which includes those who continuously worked on-site, serves as the
reference category. Figure and table show relative risk ratios, which denote the “risk” of
belonging to a certain cluster relative to the reference category of Cluster 1; values
below 1 indicate a lower probability, and above 1 a higher probability.

Membership in Cluster 2 (continuously working from home) is significantly
related to a high educational degree, working in the service sector, and having a high
personal income. Individuals with high educational degree have an almost 600 percent
increased probability of belonging to this cluster compared to Cluster 1, for members of
the service sector the probability is 113.2 percent higher, and for those with high
earnings it is 80.3 percent higher. Although women are slightly underrepresented in this
cluster, gender differences are not significant after controlling for sector and previous
income. Cluster 3 (transitionally working from home) has a significant, two times
higher share of employees in public administration and the education and health sectors,
an almost three times higher share of individuals with a high educational degree, and a
128.9 percent higher share of employees with high earnings. Hence, in addition to the
21

sectoral differences, for the cluster of transitional remote work the income gradient is
steeper, while for the cluster of continuous remote work the educational gradient is
steeper. Older employees have a lower probability of belonging to either of the two
homeworking clusters, while poor health is not related to working from home. Hence,
homeworking does not appear to be more common among those at a higher risk of
severe illness in case of COVID-19 infection; it is instead a privilege of highly educated
high earners in specific areas of the service and public sectors.
With respect to the composition of Cluster 4 (continuous short-time work) and
Cluster 5 (transitional short-time work), it is especially interesting which factors are not
significant. First, there are no significant differences between genders in either cluster
membership. Second, short-time work does not seem to be restricted to specific
educational or income groups. It instead appears to be highly sector specific: employees
in the industrial sector have a higher chance of being in continuous short-time work
than those in the service and public sectors. For transitional short-time, there are no
significant differences between the service and industrial sectors. Third, the risk of
being in continuous in short-time work decreases with age, and employees with
migration background have a more than two times higher risk to be in transitional shorttime work.
Employees with low earnings have a higher chance of being continuously or
transitionally furloughed (Cluster 6 and 7). Employees who earned below 1,000 Euro in
monthly net income before the pandemic were 3.7 times more likely to be continuously
furloughed and 2.7 times more likely to be transitionally furloughed compared to the
middle-income group. Continuous and transitional furlough mainly occur in public
administration and the education and health sectors. Women have a higher chance of
being continuously furloughed because they are overrepresented in low-income jobs.

22

Furthermore, the risk of being continuously furloughed is almost four times higher for
employees with poor health, and this risk increases with age. In Cluster 8
(unemployment), the income gradient is even more pronounced than in the two furlough
clusters; those with previously low earnings having a significant 6.5 times higher risk of
job loss. Furthermore, for those with poor health, the risk of being unemployed is
almost 5.9 times higher, even more than being continuously furloughed.

Cluster outcomes
Table 2 reports the results of the multinomial logit models with the clusters as
dependent variables. Again, the largest cluster (Cluster 1)—those continuously working
on-site—serves as the reference category. In all regressions we control for cluster
composition in terms of gender, age, and educational degree. Model 1 incudes changes
in household income and COVID-19 infection, and Model 2 adds the subjective risk of
job loss (we therefore exclude Cluster 8, unemployed, from this model).

We find that employees continuously in short-time work, in transitional
furlough, and unemployed experienced a significant reduction in their household
income between February and June; these relationships remain significant after
controlling for cluster composition. Short-time workers lost 16.2 percent more of their
income between February and June compared to the reference group; for those in
transitional furlough the reduction is 15.2 percent, and for unemployed individuals it is
13.1 percent. As the latter two groups comprised a high share of low-wage earners
before the onset of the pandemic, this income reduction is especially severe for them.
Compared to those continuously working on-site, almost all other employees
perceived their job security as lower; the lowest values were found in the two short-time
clusters (Model 2). Both perceived their risk of becoming unemployed in the next year
as more than 2 times higher than workers without a change in working hours or
location. Employees in the two furlough clusters experienced 1.7 times higher
subjective job insecurity than members of Cluster 1. Interestingly, those who
continuously worked from home were also significantly more concerned about losing
their job than employees working continuously on-site, even though the former group
comprises mostly highly educated high earners. Only employees who transitionally
worked from home and then returned to working on-site displayed no significant
increase in subjective unemployment risk compared to those continuously working onsite.
Lastly, we analyse whether cluster membership is related to different
probabilities of COVID-19 infection (Model 1). Overall, we find no significant
differences between the employment clusters, apart from the transitional furlough
cluster: employees in this group have a significant 4.7 times higher risk of confirmed or
very likely infection compared to Cluster 1.

Discussion and conclusion
We have examined how the employment trajectories of workers in Germany were
affected during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the lockdown and
containment measures, and how this aligns with existing inequalities in the country’s
labour market. Indeed, the immediate employment consequences mirror the existing
segmentation of the labour market in a much more pronounced way than in previous
recessions. Employees in the occupational segment experienced the fewest changes as
they predominantly continued to work on-site with their usual hours. Highly educated
employees in the internal segment of the service sector are to a larger extent in the
privileged position of being able to work from home. Employees in low-wage
employment in the service sector were particularly negatively affected by furlough and
job loss. Short-time work was more likely among employees in manufacturing, but it is
not restricted to certain wage or educational groups. In summary, Hypotheses 1 and 3
are largely supported, as those with lower educational degrees and in low-wage
employment were indeed more affected by continuous furlough and job loss. Short-time
work, however, is more diversely distributed, not only among the middle segment of
manufacturing as assumed in Hypothesis 3.
By applying sequence analysis, we are able to shed more light on the dynamics
of employment trajectories. For all three states (working from home, short-time work
and furlough), we identify two groups: (1) the state is persistent over the whole
observation period and (2) the state is transitional – those affected returned to working
their usual hours on-site in late April to early May when the containment measures were
eased. These two groups differ not only in the timing of their employment transitions,
but also in their socio-economic composition and outcomes. While those in continuous
short-time work are similar to short-time workers in previous recessions—male

26

industrial workers with medium incomes—the group of transitional short-time workers
during the COVID-19 recession is much more diverse; it includes more women,
migrants and service sector employees. Generally, working from home is predominant
among highly educated, high-income employees. However, the educational gradient is
more pronounced for continuous homeworking, which is more widespread in the private
service sector; transitional homeworking is more widespread in the public sector. Being
female, in the low-wage sector, and having an adverse health condition is associated
with a higher risk of being continuously furloughed. The social gradient is not as strong
for transitional furlough, although also here low-wage earners are overrepresented.
Also, those in transitional furlough are the only group with an increased risk of COVID19 infection. However, we cannot determine the extent to which this can be attributed to
their work. In summary, for low-wage employees in the service sector, short-time work
is mostly transitional, while continuous short-time work is more common among
industrial workers in the middle segment of the labour market, which supports
Hypothesis 4. Contrary to Hypothesis 5, however, those who return to working on-site
after initially working from home are by no means lower paid and lower qualified than
other homeworkers.
Taking into account the dynamics of employment transitions also helps us to
identify gender differences. In the pandemic recession, women were almost equally
affected by short-time work as men; however, women entered short-time work earlier
and for them it was more transitional. Of course, employees in the lower segment of the
service sector were immediately hit by the containment measures, but returned to their
usual working hours after the restrictions were eased. Yet, this also means that their
position is much more fragile and may change quickly when new stay-at-home orders
are imposed. Overall, the results on gender differences support Hypothesis 2—that

27

women were at least equally affected by the negative employment consequences of the
pandemic. The more transitional nature of employment consequences for (female)
employees in the lower segment of the service sector is in line with Hassel’s (2014)
assessment that the conditions for this group are similar to those in liberal market
economies, i.e. they are much more exposed to market forces with fewer institutional
buffers.
Almost all changes in employment situations were associated with increased
feelings of job insecurity; the income effects were less pronounced. Compared to those
continuing to work on-site, employees in all clusters experienced a significant decrease
in job security, including employees who continuously worked from home, although
they represent the most highly qualified group of employees. Only those who changed
from remote work to working on-site did not assess their job security significantly
differently from employees who have continuously worked on-site. Significant
reductions in household income emerge for employees in continuous short-time work,
in unemployment and for those in transitional furlough. As the latter two groups
included high shares of individuals with previously low income, a further reduction in
household income is especially severe for them.
Our study can only provide a snapshot of the employment consequences and
long-term development of inequality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Furthermore, our analysis is limited by the low case numbers for specific subgroups
such as young labour market entrants and migrants. Therefore, further research is
needed to monitor long-term employment changes and to better understand the situation
for specific subgroups of employees. Despite these limitations, our results make clear
that the pandemic’s impact on labour market inequality is different from that of
previous recessions. The low-wage segment of the service sector, the recent expansion

28

of which has been strongly promoted by political reforms, was largely exempt in the
Great Recession, which helped conceal the adverse conditions in that sector. The
pandemic has hit these groups of labour market outsiders the hardest. Nor are highly
qualified employees spared from the new insecurities, as shown by the higher sense of
job insecurity reported by continuous homeworkers. Therefore, the usual government
crisis measures that address a decline in large manufacturing companies and a focus on
male industrial workers need to be adapted to the pandemic crisis.
