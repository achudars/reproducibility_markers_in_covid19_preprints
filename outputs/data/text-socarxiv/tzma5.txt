Abstract
This paper evaluates gender inequality in employment risks during the first and the
second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. We use individual-level
panel data collected weekly between 20 March and 9 July 2020, and again in
January 2021, to examine the risks of short-time work, job loss and unpaid
furlough, as well as having to work on-site by means of growth curve modelling.
The results reveal gender inequality in employment risks and gendered use of
governmental support schemes. During the early phase of the pandemic, women
had a higher probability of being temporarily exempted from work, but a lower
probability of being in short-time work and receiving the associated state benefits.
Compared to men, women also continuously had a higher probability of working
on-site rather that from home. Consequently, women’s employment during the
pandemic is more polarized between job loss or working on-site with the
associated infection risk. Gender inequalities are rooted in the long-term gendered
dualization of the German labour market with the low-wage sector and marginal
employment being female dominated. The results call for close monitoring of longterm gendered effects of the pandemic recession and an adjustment of
governmental crisis measures to the requirements of the female workforce.

Introduction
In early research on the employment consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic,
implications for gender inequality were widely discussed. Several early studies showed
that the effects of the pandemic recession differ from those of previous recessions, as
women especially are expected to be disproportionally affected (Alon, Doepke,
Olmstead-Rumsey, & Tertilt, 2020a; Collins, Landivar, Ruppanner, & Scarborough,
2020). However, most research on the consequences of the pandemic for gender
inequality focused on the sharing of child care and home-schooling tasks in couples
facing school and day-care closures, and its implications for parents’ and especially
mothers’ well-being (Hank & Steinbach, 2020; Hipp & Bünning, 2020; Möhring et al.,
2020; Yerkes et al., 2020). Less research has been devoted to exploring gender
inequality within employment risks induced by the pandemic. The few existing studies
point out that working women are highly affected by job loss and working hours
reduction in the pandemic recession (Alon et al., 2020a; Collins et al., 2020; Möhring et
al., 2021). Therefore, the current pandemic recession is described as ‘Shecession’
(Alon, Doepke, Olmstead-Rumsey, & Tertilt, 2020b). In contrast, women are also
overrepresented among essential workers, especially in the health and care sector
(Blundell, Dias, Joyce, & Xu, 2020). However, previous studies operate either with
projections based on data that was gathered before the onset of the pandemic (e.g., Alon
et al., 2020a), or are based on descriptive analysis of cross-sectional data (e.g., Blundell
et al., 2020). Furthermore, existing research on the employment consequences of the
COVID-19 pandemic mostly focuses on liberal market economies such as the United
States of America. These countries with their comparatively flexible labour markets
experienced a sharp rise in unemployment (OECD, 2021). In the USA, job loss among
women was indeed much more severe than in previous recessions (Alon et al., 2020b).

2

In more regulated welfare states, unemployment did not sharply rise immediately after
the onset of the pandemic because governments implemented new or existing job
retention schemes, as the “furlough scheme” in the UK, and the “short-time work”
benefit in Germany (Adams‐Prassl, Boneva, Golin, & Rauh, 2020; Konle-Seidl, 2020;
OECD, 2021). The consequences of these approaches for gender inequality at the labour
market are not clear and have not been investigated so far.
With this background, the present study focuses on the situation in Germany,
which has a highly regulated labour market and provides a generous social security net
for the core work force, but is also characterized by a high gender-based dualization of
employment. We address two research questions related to gender inequality in
employment during the pandemic recession. What gender differences can be identified
in the risks of short-time work, job loss, and having to work on-site in the early phase
and in the further course of the crisis? Which factors related to socio-economic status
and employment explain these differences? To the best of our knowledge, this study is
the first using detailed longitudinal data to analyse how gender inequalities in
employment have evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Our data
provides weekly information on the employment status over a time-span of 16 weeks
ranging from 23 March to 9 July 2020. We combine this weekly data with further
longitudinal information for January 2021, thereby covering the first COVID-19
lockdown and the period after containment measures were eased, as well as the second
lockdown in winter 2020/21. The data comes from the German Internet Panel (GIP), a
longitudinal survey representative of the German population (Blom, Gathmann, &
Krieger, 2015), and a special COVID-19 study, carried out as part of the GIP (Blom et
al., 2020).

This article is organised as follows: in the next section we describe gender
inequality on the German labour market and the design and targeting of governmental
crisis measures. Based on these descriptions, we derive hypotheses for the empirical
analyses. Our data, sample, operationalizations, and methods are explained in the
“Materials and Methods” section. Afterwards, we present descriptive results on gender
differences in employment between March and July 2020, and in January 2021. We
then turn to our multivariate results for the risks of short-time work, being out of work,
and working on-site- first of the growth curve models for the first wave of the pandemic
in spring and summer 2020, and second of cross-sectional regressions for January 2021.
We close the article with a discussion of the results and conclusion.

Background
Gendered dualization of the German labour market
Germany is a conservative welfare state with a coordinated market economy and
corporatist structure (Esping-Andersen, 1990; Hall & Soskice, 2001). In the post-war
decades, West Germany represented a male-breadwinner society promoting a traditional
gendered division of tasks in couples (Struffolino, Studer, & Fasang, 2016). The
traditional division of paid work and unpaid care work between men and women was
underpinned by central elements of the social security system, taxation, and wage
structure (Schäfer & Gottschall, 2015; Trappe, Pollmann-Schult, & Schmitt, 2015).
Family policy focused on cash benefits and long leave periods for mothers and public
childcare remained largely underdeveloped in the pre-millennial decades (Gangl &
Ziefle, 2015). The marriage tax premium generally disincentivizes the increase of
employment hours or the uptake of employment by the part-time or non-working
spouse, thereby supporting inequality in labour market participation among married

4

couples (Bach, Haan, & Ochmann, 2013). Especially during the economic upturn in the
immediate post-war decades, wage levels of industrial workers were sufficient to
provide a livelihood for a family without the necessity of a second earner (Schäfer &
Gottschall, 2015). Men’s employment careers of the post-war decades were
characterized by an exceptional homogeneity and stability (Lersch, Schulz, & Leckie,
2020; Möhring, 2016).
This traditional arrangement has been changing for about three decades. First,
changes induced by the economic crises of the 1970s and the stalled economic
development of the 1980s led to mass unemployment and an increasing
destandardization of men’s employment histories. At the same time, women’s
attachment to the labour market steadily increased. Second, with German re-unification,
East Germany was integrated into the Western institutional setting, which was at odds
with the predominant dual-earner model in the former socialist German Democratic
Republic. Today, Eastern German women’s labour force participation is still higher than
Western German women’s, albeit converging to Western-German level, especially with
respect to part-time work (Trappe et al., 2015). Finally, reforms in family policy since
the mid-2000s towards a Scandinavian model, including the expansion of public child
care in Western Germany, led to a further increase in the labour market participation of
women. Despite these developments, central elements of the institutional structure that
supports a male breadwinner model, such as the marital wage premium, are still in
place. As a consequence, the incentives for labour market participation of women, and
especially mothers, are contradictory. Thus, the change in women’s employment
occurred mainly through higher labour market involvement of women in the form of
part-time and marginal employment, the so-called ‘Mini-Jobs’, with the latter not being
subject to social security payment and protection (Bergmann, Scheele, & Sorger, 2019).

5

Labour market inequality intensified after the labour market reforms of the early
2000s, which included the flexibilisation of the low-wage sector through incentives for
employers and employees to generate and take up low wage employment (Bosch &
Weinkopf, 2008; Eichhorst & Marx, 2011). These changes implied an increased
dualization of the labour force, including a polarisation between full-time and part-time
employees in terms of wages and job security (Brülle, Gangl, Levanon, & Saburov,
2019; Emmenegger, Hausermann, Palier, & Seeleib-Kaiser, 2012). As a consequence,
gender represents a main division in the dualized German labour market with
predominantly women working part-time and in the low wage sector (Hassel, 2014;
Häusermann & Schwander, 2012). Although female labour force participation in
Germany is above the EU average, with 72.8 percent of women in employment in 2019
compared to the EU average of 64.1 percent, a more nuanced look shows that women in
Germany are often still on the margins of the labour market: 46.7 percent of women
worked part-time, compared to the EU-average of 31.3 percent, or just 9.9 percent of
men in Germany (data for 2019; Eurostat, 2020a). Furthermore, 26.2 percent of women
in Germany are in low-wage employment, compared to the EU-average of 18.8 percent;
this is one of the highest shares in Europe (data for 2018; Eurostat, 2020b).

Gender bias of government crisis measures
The German security system buffers income short-fall, providing earnings-related
benefits in case of unemployment or health-related loss of work ability. These benefits
are supposed to secure the previous living standard instead of just preventing poverty,
and thereby serve as an automatic stabilizer of life-time earnings and consumption
(Gangl, 2004; Hall & Soskice, 2001). During economic crises, further instruments
compensate for negative consequences. Short-time work is the main instrument of
social policy to avoid mass lay-offs during economic crises in Germany. It allows

6

companies to reduce working hours and wages of employees in times of economic
hardship. The employer can then apply for a government earnings replacement that
compensates for the wage loss of up to 60 percent of the previous net wage and 67
percent for employees with dependent children (Konle-Seidl, 2020; Wachter, 2020).
Generally, governmental crises measures are designed for the usual cyclic
economic recessions that first and foremost hit the export-oriented German industrial
sector, such as the automotive industry, as well as the construction industry. Especially
during the Great Recession, these measures were successful in preventing mass
unemployment. Usual economic recessions affect men’s employment much more than
women’s: the average working hours of men are reduced more than those of women,
because the male-dominated industry and construction sectors are stronger affected
from job losses, making men’s employment much more volatile and depended on the
economic circumstances (Doepke & Tertilt, 2016). This was generally also the case for
Germany during the Great Recession, but job losses here were much fewer and rather
short-term, due to the rapid recovery of the German economy compared to many other
countries (Rinne & Zimmermann, 2012). During the Great Recession, the short-time
work policy was applied and, in conjunction with direct state subsidies, mass lay-offs
were prevented in the export-oriented industrial sectors, such as the automotive industry
(Burda & Hunt, 2011). On the contrary, the service sector had an increase in
employment even in the core crisis years of 2008/09. This led to an increase in the
employment rate of women in part-time and especially atypical employment during this
period (Kirchmann & Rosemann, 2010). Hence, the fact that crises measures are mostly
targeted at male-dominated sectors of the economy did not become noticeable at that
time.

7

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the German federal government has extended
existing crisis measures and adopted several new subsidies to mitigate the negative
consequences. It prolonged the short-time work benefits to up to 24 months or the end
of 2021 and enacted a temporary increase to 70 percent (77 percent) of the net wage
after four months and 80 percent (87 percent) after seven months of benefits (BMAS,
2020). A government aid package including direct payments for companies that had lost
revenues was launched during the spring lockdown, and repeated several times
afterwards (BMWI, 2021). Nevertheless, the economic aid package is still largely
focused on male-dominated sectors of the economy. Wiesner (2020) presents the only
study to date on the distribution of aid funds in Germany from a gender perspective.
According to their calculations, the largest share of the package consists of direct
government subsidies for affected companies in the private sector, while payments for
the social and cultural sector, including care, health, education, and art/culture, are
smaller. Even investments in sectors with a high female share of the workforce, such as
public child care and health, focus on construction and infrastructure measures, and thus
mainly benefit the largely male-dominated construction sector (Wiesner, 2020).
Furthermore, gender differences also exist in the eligibility and level of the
short-time work benefit. Most importantly, jobs that are not subject to social security
payments are exempted from short-time work. As a result, many female employees
working in sectors heavily affected by the pandemic crisis, such as retail and hospitality,
are excluded from receiving the short-time work earning’s replacement and thus cannot
bridge pandemic-related closures and restrictions. Furthermore, the short-time work
benefit has to be applied for by the employer, which requires administrative effort that
small firms in the service sector are might be less capable of to than large
manufacturing companies. Therefore, one response to the pandemic has been to

8

temporarily suspend employees. These furloughed employees represent a highly
heterogenous group: for some, especially civil servants in the public sector, salary is
continued, while others neither receive pay from their employer, nor any government
earnings replacement to compensate for their loss of income (unlike Britain’s temporary
furlough scheme; Adams‐Prassl, Boneva, et al., 2020). Those in precarious employment
ineligible to short-time work benefits mostly compose the latter group (Grabka,
Braband, & Göbler, 2020). Even for those eligible to short-time work benefits, gender
differences exist. Sectors with collective agreement coverage grant an upscaling of the
short-time work benefit of up to 90 percent of the previous wage. Women, however,
mostly work in areas that are not subject to collective agreements (Hammerschmid,
Schmieder, Wrohlich, 2020; Wiesner, 2020). In contrast, women are overrepresented in
the social and care professions with 83.7 percent of employees being female, and in
nursing professions with 81.8 percent, as well as in retail with 71.5 percent of
employees (Bundesagentur für Arbeit, 2021). Therefore, they represent a large share of
the so-called key workers during the pandemic (Koebe, Samtleben, Schrenker & Zucco,
2020). As such, they have to work close to patients or customers and do not have selfdetermination over their work location, which is potentially related to a higher risk of
COVID-19 infection (Vlachos, Hertegård & Svaleryd, 2021; Möhring et al., 2021).

Hypotheses
Due to the gendered dualization of the labour market and the gender bias of economic
aid policies in Germany, the following expectations for gender differences in
employment risks are derived: First, as a consequence of the stronger impairment of
female-dominated sectors in the current recession and the eligibility requirements of the
short-time work benefit, women’s risk of short-time work will be lower than men’s
(Hypothesis 1a), and this will be mainly due to their higher share in the areas of the

9

service sector mainly affected by the pandemic-related closures (Hypothesis 1b). In
contrast, women’s risk of being out of work will be higher than men’s (Hypothesis 2a)
due to their higher shares in low-wage employment (Hypothesis 2b). Furthermore,
women will have a higher likelihood of working on-site (Hypothesis 3a) which will be
explained by sectoral differences (Hypothesis 3b). As women’s employment is more
dependent on the introduction and relaxation containment measures, their risks of shorttime work and being out of work will be more volatile over time (Hypothesis 4).

Materials and methods
Data and operationalisation
We use data from the GIP, which is based on a random probability sample of the
general population of Germany aged 16 to 75. The panel started in 2012 and was
supplemented with additional participants in 2014 and 2018. The panel participants
were recruited offline using strict statistical procedures (Blom et al. 2015). Every other
month, panel participants are invited to take part in a voluntary online survey. The GIP
launched a special survey on 20 March 2020 to gather data about the COVID-19
pandemic. GIP respondents were invited to take surveys every week. We merge this
weekly information for the early phase of the pandemic with further information from
the survey months September 2020 and January 2021. In the descriptive analysis we use
weights to extrapolate participants’ characteristics to those of Germany’s general
population based on age, gender, marital status, highest level of education, household
size, and federal state. In all analyses, we include only individuals who were employed
in January 2020 and are below 68 years old. The sample size for the period March to
July 2020 is N=1,849, and for January 2021 N=2,027. The case number of the regular
GIP wave in January 2021 is higher than of the March to July 2020 survey because 1/8

10

of the GIP sample were not included in the special Corona survey to use it as control
group for later survey methodological analyses (Blom et al., 2020).
With respect to the employment situation, we are interested in the risks of shorttime work, being out of work, and working on-site. For the risks of short-time work we
have direct information from the respondents on whether they are in short-time work
and receive governmental short-time work benefits at each weekly interview. For being
out of work, we summarise unemployment and being suspended without pay, as the
latter is de-facto equal to being temporary unemployed. Working on-site is
operationalized using information on the work location, and summarizing those who
always or mainly work on-site, with those who work always, mainly, or half of the time
from home as reference category. Also, for estimating the risks of working on-site, we
exclude those in furlough, short-time, and unemployment, what reduces the sample to
N=1,782.
The main explanatory variable is gender, coded as 1 for women with men as
reference category. We include several control variables, including: educational degree,
distinguishing between low (without further qualification), middle (vocational training
degree), and high (higher education degree); occupational sector, in four categories
(industry, service, public administration/education/health, other); and personal net
income, in three categories (below 1,000 Euro, 1,000–2,500 Euro, above 2,500 Euro).
These income categories refer to the 25 and 75 percent quartiles of the income
distribution in the GIP- yet this is a rough estimate, as income was measured in 15
categories. All control variables are measured before the onset of the pandemic.
Appendix Table A.1 provides an overview of all variables.

Methods
We apply logit random effects growth curve models in order to estimate the average

11

risk trajectories of entering the respective states short-term work or out of work between
March 20th (week 1) and July 9th (week 16). Similar to fixed effects models, random
effects growth curve models account for serial correlations and are suitable for
unbalanced panels (Banerjee, 2009; Singer & Willett, 2003). However, the latter
method provides parameters for both time-varying as well as time-constant variables,
thereby enabling us to estimate group-specific growth curve trajectories for gender,
occupational sector, educational attainment and income bracket.

Here, DV denotes the dependent variable, which in the first set of models is the state
‘short-time work’ and in our second set of models the state ‘out of work.’ Subsequently,
t represents weekly observations of an individual i. We include the first to fourth
polynomial of week in order to model change in the DV and account for the potential
volatility across the observation window, which might emerge against the background
of frequent fluctuations in COVID-19 prevalence or related government measures.
Models further include an interaction between the weekly terms and the variable group,
which is gender. Here, we pursue the following approach: In the first set of models, we
estimate group-specific growth curves for gender. In order to disentangle potential
gender-differences, we subsequently run growth curve models conditional on
occupational sector, income bracket and educational attainment. Finally, 𝜇 + 𝜀
respectively represent the individual time-constant and time-varying error terms.

Results
Descriptive overview of gender differences in employment
Our analyses include only those individuals who have been in gainful employment in
January 2020 to focus on if and how they are affected by the changes induced by the
pandemic. Table 1 gives an overview of gender differences in the composition of this
group. Among women employed in January 2020, 42.0 percent were working part-time
and 7.0 percent were in marginal employment compared to 6.4 percent and 1.9 percent
of men (excluding individuals in vocational training). In line with these differences in
job type, 21.2 percent of working women had a personal net income below 1,000 Euro,
while only 5.0 percent of working men. Gender differences in job sector were also
large: 40.0 percent of working men were in the manufacturing sector, while only 15.4
percent of women. In contrast, 43.1 percent of women worked in public administration,
education, and health, while only 20.4 percent of men. Shares in the service sector apart
from public administration, education, and health were quite equal with 36.1 percent of
men and 34.9 percent of women working in these fields. However, within the service
sector, the distribution was gendered, for example, while 54.0 percent of employees in
retail and commerce were female, only 27.1 in IT and communication. The highest
female share in the private service sector is 84.5 percent in “other services” which
mainly includes small-scale household-related services as cleaning.
<Table 1 here>
Between late March and early July 2020, 14.2 percent of women and 24.1
percent of men experienced short-time work for at least one week. 7.6 percent of
women and 8.7 percent of men were either unemployed or furloughed without pay for at
least one week. For women, the mean duration of both of these states combined was

13

slightly longer with 7.4 weeks compared to 6.4 weeks for men. Figure 1 illustrates how
the weekly employment situation of those who were in gainful employment in January
2020 changed over the course of the lockdown separated by gender and for selected
time-points. In the week of 20 to 26 March 2020, 4.1 percent of female employees
reported that they were receiving the government short-time work allowance; this
number climbed to over 10.8 percent in early May 2020. Men started from a slightly
lower level of short-time work in late March of 3.5 percent, yet their share increased
more steeply to 15.7 percent in early May 2020. Also, men’s share in short-time work
was almost twice as high as women’s in early July 2020 after the first wave of the
pandemic when the restrictions were eased with 8.2 percent compared to 4.5 percent.
This continued in September 2020 and January 2021 when men’s shares in short-time
work were at 7.6 percent and 6.9 percent respectively, while only 3.7 and 4.6 percent of
female employees were in short-time work. Women’s shares of unemployment and
unpaid furlough were almost always slightly higher than men’s: 6.9 percent of female
employees compared to 5.5 percent of male employees were out of work immediately in
late March 2020. 3.8 percent of women and 3.2 of men were out of work in early May
2020, and 1.5 percent of women and 1.0 percent of men in January 2021.
<Figure 1 here>
Comparing genders in terms of the work location shows that women had higher
shares working on-site over the whole period from late March 2020 to January 2021. In
late March 2020, 26.0 percent of women and 31.4 percent of men were working from
home. For both genders, the share of homeworking declined until autumn 2020 to 12.5
percent of women and 17.4 percent of men working from home in September 2020. In
January 2021, during the peak of the second pandemic wave, 21.6 percent of women
compared to 24.3 percent of men were working from home.

Gender differences in employment risks during the early phase of the pandemic
We use three sets of Logistic Random Effects Panel Models to assess the probability of
(1) short-time work, (2) being out of work, and (3) working on-site, for the period of 20
March to 9 July covering the first COVID-19 wave in Germany. The regression results
are depicted in Tables 2-4, and Figures 2 and 3. The Figures report the predicted
probabilities of short-time work and being out of work for each of the 16 weeks covered
in the survey and separated by gender. For their estimation, interactions of the variables
for time with gender were integrated in the growth curve models (full regression tables
are included in Appendix Tables A.4 and A.5).
<Tables 2 and 3 here>
During the first COVID-19 lockdown, women had significantly reduced odds of
short-time work by 54.0 percent compared to men (Table 2, Model 1). This gap even
increases to 61.2 percent when we control for educational status and income group in
Model 2. When controlling for sector of employment, however, the gender difference in
the odds of short-time work is reduced to 16.2 percent and becomes insignificant (Table
2, Model 5). Compared to manufacturing, employees in the service sector had 59.4
percent reduced odds of short-time work, and employees in the public, education and
health sectors by even 97.4 percent (Table 2, Model 5). With respect to income groups,
the results show that the highest likelihood of short-time work existed for those
receiving a medium income, they have 10.3 percent higher odds than those with lower
incomes, while those with higher incomes have 29.1 percent lower odds than those with
lower incomes (Table 2, Model 5). Yet, these differences between income groups are
not significant. To sum up, women’s lower likelihood of short-time work in the early
phase of the pandemic can be explained, first and foremost, by their higher shares in the
service sector. Besides, the fact that more women work in low-income jobs explains

15

their lower likelihood of short-time work. Figure 2 shows the marginal effects for the
probability of short-time work over the 16 weeks covered in the survey without (Panel
A) and with control variables (Panel B). Men and women started with the same
probability of short-time work in late March 2020. Men’s probability increased to a
higher level than women’s in mid-April and afterwards remained on a higher level,
while women’s probability of short-time work reduced back to its initial level in early
July 2020 (Figure 2, Panel A). When controlling for sector of employment and earnings
level, the difference in men’s and women’s probability of short-time work is
insignificant for almost the whole time-span. Only from late June onwards is women’s
probability significantly lower than men’s (Figure 2, Panel B).
<Figure 2 here>
In contrast to short-time work, women had 75.9 percent higher odds of being out
of work compared to men during the early phase of the pandemic (Table 3, Model 1).
This difference, however, is only significant on a 10%-point level. When controlling
for income group, the gender difference reverses, and becomes insignificant, and when
controlling additionally for sector, women had 47.3 percent reduced odds of being out
of work compared to men, again significant on a 10%-point level (Table 3, Model 5).
For income group and sector, the results for out of work and short-time work differ. The
odds of being out of work are significantly reduced the higher the personal income, with
high income earners having 98.5 percent lower odds than those with low income (Table
3, Model 5). Service sector employees have about 9 times higher odds to be out of work
than those in manufacturing (Table 3, Model 5). Therefore, women’s higher risk of job
loss and being suspended without continued pay during the early phase of the pandemic
resulted from their overrepresentation in low-income jobs and the service sector. Figure
3 shows marginal effects for the probability of being out of work over the whole time-

16

span. Women’s probability of being out of work was higher than men’s in late March
2020, but steadily declined over the observation window until men’s probability of
being out of work surpassed women’s in early July (Figure 3, Panel A). When
controlling for sector of employment and earnings level, the difference in men’s and
women’s probability of being out of work is still mostly insignificant with men having a
slightly higher probability, especially towards the end of the observation window from
late June onwards (Figure 3, Panel B).
<Figure 3 here>
Again, we use Logistic Random Effects Panel Models to assess the probability
of working on-site compared to working from home for the period of 20 March to 9
July. The regression results are depicted in Table 4. Women had 71.5 percent higher
odds of working on-site than men (Table 4, Model 1). After controlling for earningslevel, the gender difference becomes insignificant and is reversed with women having
46.9 percent lower odds of working on-site (Table 4, Model 3), and is further reduced to
43.7 percent lower odds of working on-site after additionally controlling for sector of
employment (Table 4, Model 5). Consequently, as in the case of being out of work,
women’s lower probability of working from home was primarily explained by their
higher shares in low-income jobs compared to men.
<Table 4 here>

Gender differences in employment risks in the second wave of the pandemic
We next turn to the employment situation in January 2021 during the second wave of
the COVID-19 pandemic. We use two sets of Logistic Models to assess the probability
of (1) short-time work; and (2) being out of work. However, as we do not have weekly
information for this survey wave, these are cross-sectional regressions. The results are

17

depicted in Appendix Tables A.2 and A.3. The determinants of gender differences in the
odds of short-time work have changed compared to the first wave of the pandemic.
First, the gender difference was smaller with women having 27.0 percent lower odds
than men, and this difference is only significant on a 10%-point level (Table A.3, Model
1). When controlling for educational status and income group, the gender gap becomes
larger (women having 46.2 percent lower odds) and highly significant (Table A.3,
Model 3). This is however partly reversed after additionally controlling for sector
(Table A.3, Model 5). In January 2021, those with low incomes had the highest odds of
short-time work, while the difference between the service sector and manufacturing had
become insignificant (Table A.3, Model 5). The latter is also the reason why gender
differences appeared to be smaller in early 2021 than in spring and summer 2020. For
the risk of being out of work, we find no significant gender differences in January 2021.
Still, low-income workers had the highest odds of being out of work (Table A.4, Model
2); however, the differences between the service sector and manufacturing were not
significant (Table A.4, Model 5).

Discussion
Overall, the results for the early phase of the pandemic March to July 2020 provide
support for Hypotheses 1a and 2a as women had a lower likelihood of short-time work
and a higher chance of being out of work during the first lockdown. Gender differences
in the short-time work probability were explained by the higher share of female
employees in the service sector in particular, and differences in the out of work risk
primarily by the higher share of women in low-wage employment. These results support
Hypotheses 1b and 2b. Furthermore, as expected in Hypothesis 3a, women had a higher
probability of working on-site than men. Yet, this was mainly explained by their higher
shares in low-income jobs, rather than by gender differences in the sectoral composition

18

of the workforce, which confutes our expectation formulated in Hypothesis 3b on
sectoral differences. Gender differences in the risks of short-time work and being out of
work are less pronounced in the second wave of the pandemic according to our results
for January 2021. Hypotheses 1-3 are not contradicted by the results for January 2021,
but the patterns of gender inequality are less intense than during the early wave of the
pandemic. With respect to changes over time, the results are in line with Hypothesis 4
showing that women’s employment trajectories are more volatile, as they more quickly
left short-time work or re-entered employment after being temporarily out of work in
the first phase of the pandemic.

Summary and conclusion
We investigated gender differences in the risks of short-time work, job-loss and unpaid
furlough, and having to work on-site during the first and the second wave of the
COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. We found women had a lower probability of shorttime work and a higher probability of job-loss and unpaid furlough than men during the
early phase of the pandemic. Differences in short-time work are due to the unequal takeup in the service sector and manufacturing: female employees are overrepresented in the
former, while short-time work has been used more in the latter during the first COVID19 wave. Also, short-time work has been used less in the lowest income group than
among employees with a medium income, and women are overrepresented among lowearners. The risk of job-loss and unpaid furlough has been higher for women especially
due to their overrepresentation in the low-income sector. Furthermore, women had a
higher probability than men of working on-site during the early phase of the pandemic,
and this mainly affects female employees in the low-income sector. The gender
differences in employment risks have reduced, yet not reversed, in the second wave of
the pandemic. Reasons for that are that the differences between the service sector and

19

manufacturing in the take-up of short-time work have become smaller. In addition, the
use of unpaid furlough as well as the share of unemployment have been very low in
January 2021.
Is the pandemic recession a ‘Shecession’? Overall, our results point to gender
inequality in the employment risks associated with the pandemic recession that differ
from previous recessions, yet this inequality does not manifest in widespread job-loss as
in the USA. Rather, it is the case in Germany that men and women are much more
equally affected be negative employment consequences during the pandemic recession
than they have been in previous recessions. Especially during the early phase of the
pandemic, inequality emerged from the long-term gender-based dualization of the
German labour market. Women had less access to the more protected status of shorttime work which is associated with governmental earnings-related benefits. Instead,
they had a higher risk of being out of work. However, both statuses were more shortterm for women: they entered and left them more quickly than men, making them more
dependent on the ups and downs of the pandemic and the containment measures, and
thus, more vulnerable. In addition, women had a higher probability to continue working
on-site instead of changing to working from home than men, which is due to their
overrepresentation among key-workers in the low-income sector. Overall, these results
contribute to the notion that women’s employment during the pandemic is, first, more
polarized between job loss and unpaid furlough for some, and necessity to work on-site
with the associated infection risk for others, and second, more volatile than during
previous recessions.
Our results point to a mismatch of the usual governmental crisis measures for
the requirements of the pandemic recession. Also, companies might have differed in
their efforts to apply for short-time work benefits: smaller firms do not have the same

20

administrative possibilities as larger companies, and therefore might have faced more
difficulty applying for the scheme. This is also a question of timing: while the service
sector was immediately hit by the containment measures, the export-oriented
manufacturing sector had more time to prepare for the temporary decline in orders.
Over the course of the pandemic, there might have been learning processes that could
explain the reduced gender differences during the second wave according to our results.
Still, our results call for a close monitoring of the further gendered effects of the
pandemic recession and an adjustment of the usual governmental crisis measures to
meet the requirements of the female workforce.
While our study is the first to use detailed longitudinal data covering the early
phase as well as the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were not able to
apply a more differentiated categorization of employment sectors due to low case
numbers. Furthermore, the advantage of weekly surveys only exists for the time-span of
the first phase of the pandemic, March to July 2020. Afterwards, the GIP changed to the
usual mode of bi-monthly surveys, and did not include employment status in each wave.
With this study, we focused on gender inequality in employment risks, and covered
neither changes in working hours nor consequences of employment risks for income
and feelings of insecurity. Here, further research is necessary.
