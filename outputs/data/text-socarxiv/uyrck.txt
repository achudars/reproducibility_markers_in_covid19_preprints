"7" "ABSTRACT"
"8" "As labor markets in recent decades have become increasingly volatile and precarious, more workers are susceptible to working conditions threatening their economic security. We examined the association between precarious parental employment, income or job loss, and parenting and child happiness during COVID-19 pandemic. We collected an online cross-sectional dataset collected in May 2020 in the United States to examine parental views on childrearing and child happiness, controlling for a rich set of sociodemographic characteristics. Our multivariate regression analysis indicate that two aspects of job precarity related to feeling vulnerable at work and receiving low material rewards from work, and losing job or income due to COVID-19 were significantly associated with a less positive view on childrearing and lower degree of child happiness reported by parents. Our analysis underscores the vulnerability faced by our parents at workforce and how a public health crisis magnified the dire consequences of a precarious job on parenting and child happiness."

"10" "The  current COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on families, imperiling economic prospects and damaging the physical and mental health of parents and children alike (Patrick et al., 2020). This is particularly true for those with precarious employment characterized by low wages and insecure jobs (Pilkington & Rao, 2020).  The United States registered a record of 15% unemployment rate within eight weeks since March 2020, when the unemployment rate was merely 4%; this accounts for an unprecedented 41 million people in the labor force filing unemployment claims (U.S. Department of Labor, 2020). In addition, according to a survey conducted by the American Psychological Association (2020; APA hereafter), parents have been significantly more stressed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic than their non-parent counterparts.  With uncertainty and fear  surrounding the risk to infection of young children ( Mandavilli , 2020) and the challenges associated with either returning to school or instituting remote learning, parents are in especially difficult positions to effectively assure the safety, educational, and financial needs of their children and families.  Over 70 percent of parents surveyed on behalf of the APA reported that managing distance and online learning is a substantial source of stress for them (APA, 2020). Furthermore, in comparison to non-parents, those with children are significantly more likely to report inadequate access to food, housing, and healthcare as sources of stress and hardship in their lives (APA, 2020).  As a result of the pandemic, there has been an increase in food insecurity (Patrick et al., 2020), which is further exacerbated by the fact that many vulnerable or impoverished parents depend on free school breakfasts and lunches as a source of nutrition for their children throughout the day (Fernandez, 2020). This paper adds to the growing knowledge on the degree to which parental employment particularly a precarious one and income/job loss may be linked with parenting and child happiness amidst COVID-19."
"11" "PRECARIOUS PARENTAL EMPLOYMENT AND ECONOMIC HARDSHIP"
"12" "Economic hardship is usually, if not always, brought up by insecure employment. As work constitutes a central part of an individual’s life, with people tending to define themselves by the type of  work they are engaged with, losing one’s job or income is likely to adversely affect physical and mental health, and indeed studies have confirmed such a causal relationship ( Hellgren  &  Sverke , 2003). However, globally, since the mid-1970s, the nature of employment conditions for most workers, and particularly those in low-skill low-wage jobs or in service-sector jobs, has transformed from a more secure long-term, full-time employment to a more insecure and unpredictable one, substantially increasing the risk of either losing income or jobs or both ( Kalleberg , 2013). The Great Recession in 2008 was a severe manifestation of the devastating consequences faced by workers in these vulnerable positions, as they were typically fired first and often not hired back until years after the world recovered from the 2008 recession (Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2019). Since late March 2020, with the current ongoing public health crisis caused by COVID-19, the United States has witnessed staggering unemployment yet again, with claims reaching over 4 1  million workers, representing 20% of the workforce (U.S. Department of Labor, 2020)."
"13" "To date, reliable and representative data on precarious employment, such as contingent work or jobs with unpredictable schedules, have yet to be produced ( Julià  et al., 2017). What is clear from the existing research, however, is that low-wage and low-skilled workers are more likely to hold contingent work, and that part-time workers are disproportionately subject to such work conditions ( Henly  & Lambert, 2014;  Kalleberg , 2018;  Julià  et al., 2017). Previous research examining precarious employment has provided a helpful guideline to examine precariousness ( Julià  et al., 2017). For example, the Employment Precarious Scale (EPRES) developed and tested in Europe, was found effective for identifying the groups that are mostly vulnerable to precarious employment and how then precarious employment might be associated with workers’ physical and mental health ( Benach  et al., 2016;  Julià  et al., 2017). In general, and importantly, precarious employment is multidimensional concerning both work conditions and relations. Thus, dimensions such as employment (in)stability, (low) material rewards, (erosion of) workers’ rights and social protection, (de-standardized) working time  arrangements, (dis)empowerment and (lack of) opportunities for employee representation, and (imbalanced) interpersonal power relations are all considered to be part of acute situations of employment precariousness ( Julià  et al., 2017). Building upon scholarship documenting the groups of workers who were more likely to hold precarious jobs ( Kalleberg , 2013; Presser, 2003) and the EPRES research, we used both the EPRES, along with weekly work hours, nonstandard work schedules, and occupation, to define precarious employment among parents with children. Part-time workers have been documented to be more likely to hold jobs with precarious characteristics (Presser, 2003). Nonstandard work schedules tap into an important dimension of precariousness related to working time arrangements because such schedules tend to be less predictable and less stable than otherwise. Lastly, non-professional/managerial occupations such as services/sales/clericals served as a proxy for low-skilled jobs as shown in previous studies (e.g.,  Kalleberg , 2013)."
"14" "ECONOMIC HARDSHIP, PARENTING, AND CHLD WELL-BEING"
"15" "Much research has underscored the negative mental health and life outcomes associated with economic hardship for parents and children (Duncan et al., 2017). The influence of economic hardship on parenting and child development can be explained through an interplay of contextual factors. According to the Family Stress Model (Conger et al., 2000;  Masarik  & Conger, 2017), economic hardships (e.g., low income, negative economic events) precipitate an increase in economic pressure. Families experience such economic pressure by ways of unmet material needs, an inability to pay bills, and financial cutbacks, which subsequently leads to emotional distress. The stressful experiences of economic pressure contribute to a decrease in supportive behaviors and parent-child interactions, with great effect on the quality and stability of familial relationships. A suboptimal family environment and heightened parenting stress resulting from economic hardship can negatively impact a child’s cognitive functions, social competence, and academic success, while also increasing depression and anxiety (Conger et al., 2010). Parents play a critical role in bolstering their children’s coping abilities, exposure to  stress, and appraisals of danger (Bornstein,  in press ). For some children, it is possible that spending more quality time with family has had a positive impact on their health and well-being, but for those hit hardest by the pandemic and living in crowded spaces, the added stress and constrained resources are likely to shape a child’s well-being for the worse (Bornstein,  in press )."
"16" "Importantly ,   as a result of the pandemic,  disruptions to daily life have deprived children of enriching peer relationships and academic and extracurricular experiences that are important for healthy development (Bornstein,  in press ). Developmental milestones are being passed over while parents and children quarantine and self-isolate.  Along with these added stressors, many parents have reported losing emotional support during the pandemic, with great detriment to their mental health, and, subsequently, parenting behaviors and child-wellbeing (Grose, 2020). This is especially noteworthy because parents  have the ability to  buffer their children’s stress exposure and mediate their children’s emotional symptoms (Bornstein,  in press ). Nonetheless, since the onset of the pandemic, more than a quarter of parents surveyed in a national study reported a decline in mental health, while 14 percent of parents have reported worsening behavioral health for their children (Patrick et al., 2020). Such worsening health outcomes are in conjunction with approximately 50 percent of parents reporting loss of regular childcare, 11 percent reporting worsening food security, and 16 percent reporting change in insurance status (Patrick et al., 2020). As a result, experts suggest parental “burnout,” or a depletion of resources and an inability to manage stress, may be a serious threat for families across the country (Bornstein,  in press ). This dire situation is especially problematic for parents with precarious employment because of a strong link  with  job loss and thus an increase in risk for unmet health care. Furthermore, the irregular and inflexible work schedules associated with precarious employment have the potential to interfere with newfound childcare responsibilities and daily routines."
"17" "In a meta-analytic review of the far-reaching consequences of job insecurity ( Mauno  et al., 2017), six of the seven studies reviewed found that parental job insecurity was associated with worse  outcomes for the well-being of their children, while four studies found a significant relationship between parental job insecurity and poorer academic performance. Parental job insecurity was also found to be associated with a lack of engagement and support in their children’s career development, which was shown to be negatively associated with their children’s career self-efficacy (Zhao et al., 2012). Economic hardship brought about by job precarity, a significant source of parental stress, has thus the potential to generate stress in children, with great consequence to their health and well-being ( Finegood  & Blair, 2017)."
"18" "All in all, the substantial repercussions of economic hardship and job-related stress on the health and well-being of families cannot be understated.  In the midst of  concurrent financial and public health crises, the interconnected nature of financial strain, parenting stress, mental health, and child well-being makes the issues at hand to be of special importance and particular urgency. Extensive literature has demonstrated the way stress, both financial and parenting related, is detrimental to all individuals within the family unit, by way of parenting and child development (Conger et al., 2010)."
"19" "In this study, using a sample of 1,000 parents from across the United States, we paid attention to how jobs with precarious characteristics, along with job/income loss during the pandemic, might be associated with parenting and child happiness. We paid attention to parents as this population holds a critical key to the well-being of our future generations. This paper thus underscores the vulnerability of our current workforce widely susceptible to precarious jobs, and a public health risk such as COVID-19 only lays bare the inequities experienced by these workers with far-reaching impacts to our current and next generations of workforce."
"20" "METHOD"
"21" "Data"
"22" "Using a convenience sampling due to resource constraints, we collected a cross-sectional online data via Qualtrics in May 2020. The target sample was parents with at least one child aged 17 or  younger and currently residing in the United States. Recruitment was achieved through the researchers’ networks such as social media (e.g.,  facebook , online parent support group). This study was able to receive responses from every state in the United States including the District of Columbia. The share of the participants by state was qualitatively similar to the share of the state population on a national level, although the participants were somewhat overrepresented from the home state of the researchers (i.e., 17% of the participants in the sample vs. 6% of the national population from this particular state). Although participants were from all socioeconomic backgrounds, highly educated parents (e.g., graduate degree) might be overrepresented in comparison to the national average of educational achievement. This study was approved by the authors’ Institutional Review Board."
"23" "Participants"
"24" "A sample of 1,000 participants responded to the online survey. After excluding missing information, the final sample size for analysis was 932 for the outcome on parenting and 929 for the outcome on child happiness; details on missing cases are given below.  The majority of  the participants were mothers (vs. fathers), non-Hispanic White, and married. Approximately two-thirds of the participants had family income in the range of $50,000 and $99,999. Sixty percent of the participants were living in urban areas."
"25" "Measures"
"26" "Parental view on childrearing . This outcome was measured by asking parents four questions related to how they view parenting during COVID-19. These four questions were adapted from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). Questions include such as \"being a parent is harder than I thought it would be,\" and \"I feel trapped by my responsibilities as a parent.\" Responses range from 1 ( strongly agree ) to 7 ( strongly disagree ). A standardized score was calculated with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (α = 0.78). A higher score represents a more positive view on childrearing."
"27" "Child happiness . This outcome was measured by asking parents about their child’s happiness in general as well as compared to their child’s peers. Responses range from 1 ( extremely happy ) to 7 ( extremely unhappy ). A standardized score was calculated with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 with a higher score representing a happier child (α = 0.85)."
"28" "Job or income loss . A question was asked of participants about if they lost income due to COVID-19 pandemic with a response of yes or no. A follow-up question was then asked about the reasons for income loss. Two of these responses were coded as \"job loss \": \"because my place of work was closed and didn’t offer a remote work option\" or \"because I was laid off or lost my employment.\" A dichotomous variable was created if the participants answered yes to either income loss or job loss."
"29" "Job precarity . This study utilized nine indicators to measure the degree of job precarity. Three of the indicators were based on a consensus from established scholarship ( Kalleberg , 2013; Presser, 2003) showing the most likely characteristics of a precarious job tend to be: part-time, low-skill (proxies by occupation), and a non-daytime schedule (or nonstandard work schedules). The remaining five indicators were adapted from an existing precarious employment scale, the Employment Precariousness Scale (EPRES), designed and validated by the Health Inequalities Research Group (GREDS-EMCONET) at  Pompeu   Fabra  University in Spain (Vives et al., 2010; Vives et al., 2015). This scale tackles multidimensional aspects of job characteristics posing precarity to workers’ economic security through work conditions and relations. These dimensions include employment (in)stability (e.g., permanent vs. temporary contract), disempowerment, vulnerability, low material rewards, and erosion of workers’ rights and social protection (Vives et al., 2010). Below we provide details on each of these nine indicators."
"30" "For part-time work hours, participants were asked about their usual weekly work hours before the COVID-19 pandemic. Responses ranged from \"less than 10 hours,\" \"10-20 hours,\" \"21-34 hours,\" \"35-44 hours,\" \"45-54 hours,\" or \"55+ hours.\" To avoid small cell sizes, respondents who answered  weekly work hours less than 35 hours were categorized as \"part-time,\" those who answered working 35-44 hours as \"full-time,\" and those who answered working 45 or more hours per week as \"over time.\""
"31" "To proxy for  low-skill , we used the information on occupation. The participants were asked about their occupation before the COVID-19 pandemic. Ten occupation categories were provided in the survey following the U.S. Census survey (i.e., Current Population Survey): Professional and related occupations; Service occupations; Sales and related occupations; Office and administrative support occupations; Farming, fishing, and forestry occupations; Construction and extraction occupations; Installation, maintenance, and repair occupations; Production occupations; Transportation and material moving occupations; or Armed Forces. Three dichotomous variables were created representing professional or managerial occupation, service/sale/office support occupation, and all other occupations. In this study, compared to professional or managerial occupations, occupations including services/sales/offices and all others were considered to be more likely to be  low-skill . No respondents answered to be currently in Armed Forces."
"32" "For nonstandard work schedule, participants were asked about their usual work schedule before the COVID-19 pandemic. Choices were provided as follows: \"Daytime (anytime between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.),\" \"Evening (anytime between 2 p.m. and 9 p.m.),\" \"Nights (anytime between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m.),\" \"Rotating shift (changes periodically from day to evenings or nights),\" \"Split shift (consisting of two distinct periods each day),\" or \"Irregular hours.\"  The majority of  respondents answered working daytime hours, and thus a dichotomous variable was created to indicate if the participants reported working during any non-daytime hours."
"33" "For employment instability that is part of EPRES, participants were asked about the duration of the contract status for their current/most recent job. Choices ranged from 0 ( permanent contract ) to 4 ( less than 6 months ). This variable was treated as continuous with higher score representing more unstable (or temporary) employment."
"34" "We measured the disempowerment as part of EPRES with three questions asking about the level of negotiation of employment conditions related to workplace schedule, weekly work hours, and wages or salaries. Three choices were provided with 1 ( by the union or collective agreement ), 2 ( by both the employer and employee ) or 3 ( by the employer ). An average score was created from these three items with a higher score representing more disempowerment (α = .82)."
"35" "We measured vulnerability as part of EPRES with six questions asking about if the participants felt defenseless to authoritarian treatment at the workplace. Questions include such as \"feel afraid to demand better working conditions,\" \"feel defenseless towards unfair treatment by your superiors,\" with responses ranging from 0 ( never ) to 4 ( always ). An average score was calculated from these six items with the higher the score the more vulnerable the employee was (α = .83)."
"36" "We measured low material reward as part of EPRES with two questions asking if the wages or salaries were enough to cover basic needs and to cover unexpected expenses. Responses range from 0 ( very much ) to 4 ( not at all ). An average score was calculated from these two items with higher score representing lower material reward (and thus potentially economic deprivation) (α = .81)."
"37" "We measured rights as part of EPRES by asking participants to select the benefits they were entitled to at the workplace. Seven benefits were asked, including paid vacation, pension, severance pay, maternity/paternity leave, time off due to family or personal reasons, weekly/monthly/annual holidays, and unemployment compensation. A summed score ranging from 0 to 7 was calculated and then reversed so that the higher the score, the fewer rights the employee was entitled to."
"38" "To measure exercise rights as part of EPRES, five rights were asked of participants to see if they could exercise at the workplace without obstacles. Each of these five questions used a 5-Likert scale from 0 ( always ) to 4 ( never ). These five rights were weekly/monthly/annual holiday breaks, sick leave, go to the doctor, take a vacation, and request a day off for family or personal reasons. An average score  was calculated from these five items so that higher scores represent more obstacles to exercise workplace rights (α = .88)."
"39" "Sociodemographic characteristics . To reduce potential selection and omitted-variable biases, we included in our analyses an extensive set of sociodemographic characteristics that have been shown in prior research to be associated with parental work and their economic prospect (e.g.,  Kalleberg , 2013). We included the following parental characteristics: gender (male vs. female), age (less than 35 years old, 35-44 years as the reference group, or 45 or older), education (less than a college degree, college degree as the reference group, or graduate degree), race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic White as the reference group, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, of all other groups), and marital status (not-married vs. otherwise). We included the following family characteristics: number of children aged 0-5, number of children aged 6-17, number of family members living together, per capita family income (less than $50,000, $50,000-$69,000, $70,000-$99,999 as the reference group, or $100,000 or more), subjective social status, parental mental health, location (suburban, rural, vs. urban), and region (Midwest, South, and West, vs. Northeast). Subjective social status was measured using the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status, asking participants to rank themselves in reference to the nation on a ladder ranging from 1-10 (Adler et al., 2000). Parental mental health was measured by the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (Kessler et al., 2002) with 10 questions such as \"I felt depressed,\" \"I felt worthless\" with responses ranging from 1 ( none of the time ) to 5 ( all of the time ). A summed score was calculated (range = 10-42, α = 0.82)."
"40" "Empirical Strategy"
"41" "Most of the variables have less than 2% of missing data, except variables related to job precarity that contains about 4% missing data (i.e., disempowerment, exercise rights). When the missing rate is less than 5% and when the reasons for the missing data are unrelated to the outcome, analyses of complete cases do not lead to bias, which is the case here (Allison, 2000; Jakobsen et al., 2017). The final analyzed samples were 932 for the outcome on parenting and 929 for the outcome on child happiness.  Missing data analysis indicates that those excluded from the analysis (i.e., missing predictor variables) were more likely to be female, in the age group of 45 or older, single parent, having more family members living together, having income in the category of $50,000 or less, working part-time, more likely to hold nonstandard work schedules, and more likely to hold jobs with precarious characteristics related to the temporary contract and low material rewards. These differences were at least at 5% significance level. Because people with relatively less advantaged demographic characteristics were more likely to have precarious jobs ( Kalleberg , 2013), the differences reported here suggest that our estimates might underestimate the association between job precarity and parenting and child happiness."
"42" "Multivariate regression analysis was used with the ordinary least square (OLS) for continuous outcome (i.e., parental view on childrearing and child happiness) and adjusted with Huber-White standard errors that are robust to unspecified heteroskedasticity (Greene, 2012). All analyses control for sociodemographic characteristics as detailed in Measures section. We used a standardized score for outcome measures for easy interpretation of effect sizes. The standardized coefficients represent the standardized mean difference in the dependent variable with one standard deviation change in the independent variable and thus can be interpreted as effect sizes (Nieminen et al., 2013). Our last step is a subgroup analysis by examining if the associations found between parental precarious employment and parenting and child happiness might be more pronounced for parents with different demographic characteristics. We do so because previous research has shown that, for example, parents with lower degree of education, were more likely to have precarious jobs and thus more likely to shoulder the adverse consequences associated with precarious employment (Presser, 2003). We examined both parental education and family income to gauge such a possibility. We, however, reported only results by parental education because income and employment are more likely to be spuriously correlated than  education with employment (i.e., employment determines income, whereas education shapes employment)."
"43" "RESULTS"
"44" "Descriptive Picture"
"45" "Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for all analyzed variables in this study. The demographic characteristics of this sample indicate that  the majority of  these participants were married mothers younger than the ages of 45. And, about two-thirds of the participants were non-Hispanic White, with another 20% and 10% of the participants were non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic, respectively. Surveyed parents had about on average one child of each within the age range of 0-5 and of 6-17, and the average number of family members living together is almost four. Almost 20% of the sampled participants reported they have lost work or income due to COVID-19."
"46" "The demographic characteristics also point to the direction that the sample might be more advantaged, relatively speaking, than the national averages on several socioeconomic indicators. For example, about two-thirds of the participants had a college degree or higher educational achievement.  The majority of  the samples had family income in the range of $50,000 and $99,999, and the average subjective social status was slightly higher than five on a 1-10 scale. Lastly, most of the samples lived in the urban areas, and the share of the sample by region was about equally distributed with a slightly greater share of the participants from the South region."
"47" "Associations Between Precarious Job Characteristics and Parenting and Child Happiness"
"48" "Table 2 presents two outcomes of this analysis on parental view on childrearing and child happiness. A positive coefficient on parental view on childrearing and child happiness represents a better outcome. In addition, given parental view on childrearing and child happiness were standardized variables with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, the coefficient estimates on these outcomes can be interpreted as effect sizes."
"49" "Results on parental view on childrearing indicate two aspects of precarious job characteristics, vulnerability and material reward, were statistically significantly associated with less positive view on childrearing. For example, a one standard deviation change in vulnerability would reduce parental positive view on childrearing by a .10 standard deviation, albeit considered a small effect (Cohen, 1992). In addition, losing job or income due to COVID-19 was significantly associated with less positive view on childrearing, although the effect size was considered small. Parents who were 45 or older (vs. those aged 35-44), were non-Hispanic Black (vs. non-Hispanic White ), and  were not married had significantly more positive view on childrearing. In contrast, parents of Hispanic, with education less than college (vs. college degree), having more children aged 0-5, having income between $50,000-69,999 (vs. income between $70,000-99,999), and living in Midwestern region (vs. Northeast) had significantly less positive view on childrearing."
"50" "Regarding child happiness, parents who worked overtime, with occupations other than professional/managerial nor services/sales, with jobs characterized with vulnerability and low material reward reported statistically significantly lower degree of child happiness. In particular, parents working overtime (vs. working full-time) were strongly associated with a decreased child happiness by a .28 standard deviation, and a one standard deviation change in vulnerability strongly decreased child happiness by a .35 standard deviation; both effects would be considered medium (Cohen, 1992). Moreover, all non-Hispanic non-White parents, having more children aged 0-5, and living in suburban (vs. urban) were significantly associated with lower child happiness. In contrast, parents with a graduate degree (vs. college degree), with income between $50,000-69,999 (vs. between $70,000-99,999), and higher subjective social status reported significantly higher child happiness."
"51" "Subgroup Analysis"
"52" "Given previous research has shown that individuals with relatively less advantaged backgrounds, such as low education, were more likely to have precarious jobs ( Kallerberg , 2013), we conducted  supplementary analyses to see if the adverse associations found in Table 3 might be more pronounced for parents with different sociodemographic backgrounds. In this case, we examined if the adverse associations found in Table 2 might vary by parental education or family income. We reported results by parental education here given rationales noted above. However, results by family income are qualitatively  similar to  those reported here by parental education."
"53" "Specifically, as shown in Table 3, when we examined the links between precarious employment and parenting by parental education, we found that the adverse associations reported in Table 2 related to vulnerability at workplace were more pronounced among parents with college degree or lower than those with graduate degrees or higher ( F  = 9.59 and  F  = 8.98,  p  < .01). Similar results were found related to low material reward that parents with college degree or lower reported to have more unfavorable views on childrearing than those with graduate degree ( F  = 7.98,  p  < .01 and  F  = 4.88,  p  < .05). Similar results were found for child happiness by parental education related to vulnerability at workplace and low material reward."
"54" "DISCUSSION"
"55" "We set out to examine the relationship between job precarity and parenting and child happiness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results confirm the adverse associations between precarious parental employment and parents’ views on childrearing,  and also  speak to the possibility of translating this adverse association into their child’s well-being. The relationships between these variables suggest a complex interplay of intrapersonal, work, and family dynamics, with great consequence on both individuals and society at large. We note a few notable results below. Firstly, parents holding jobs with two characteristics of precarity, vulnerability and low material rewards, had a less positive view of childrearing. Here, the workplace dynamics seem to have “spilled over” into familial relationships in the home environment ( Masarik  & Conger, 2017). Many parents experiencing vulnerability at their employment  may find  parenting to be more like work than pleasure,  suggesting that parenting stress may have been exacerbated by and even linked with stress induced by job s that are  precarious. Moreover, when parents lost their jobs or income, or salaries were less likely to be enough to cover basic needs and unexpected expenses, they  may  find parenting significantly more difficult, exhausting, and stressful, as energy for parenting responsibilities had to compete with other life responsibilities. This was also true when parents were taking care of more children or had less education, as limited resources are likely to spread thin over a plethora of demands   (Conger et al., 2010). The combination of job and parental stress may  also  generate negative interactions with children (Conger et al., 2010), ultimately contributing to further distress, conflict, and exhaustion for all parties involved. Although this study did not examine parenting practices, connections between economic insecurity and parental stress and authoritative parenting have been noted in past studies (Conrad et al., 2019). Our knowledge would benefit from future studies investigating the relationship between vulnerability at work, a characteristic of precarious job, and parenting practices at home."
"56" "Secondly, while a causal relationship is not possible due to the cross-sectional nature of our research design, it is not surprising that vulnerability at work, low material reward, and loss of job or income that were adversely associated with parental views on childrearing, also were associated with lower degrees of child happiness. As prior research has demonstrated that, both parental mental health and economic circumstances influence parenting practices and engagement, which, in turn, shape child well-being (Duncan et al., 2017). Many reports (e.g., Grose, 2020; Glass, 2020) and recent publications (e.g., Patrick et al., 2020) have echoed such an adverse association during current public health and economic crises. In addition, parents who worked overtime or long hours, and therefore, presumably, had less time to spend with their children, reported that, on average, their children tended to have lower degrees of happiness. In contrast, parents with higher levels of education and subjective socioeconomic status, reported higher degrees of child happiness. In line with the Family Investment Model (Duncan et al., 2017), parental investment into children, in regard to time, nurturance, and  resources, which are all influenced by stress and employment characteristics, seems to be linked with the possibility that parents also perceive their children to be happier. It is likely then that work and economic circumstances could have strong associations with child happiness and well-being, potentially in part by way of parental stress, mental distress, and the parent-child relationship."
"57" "Of importance, we note that being Hispanic was found to be associated with less positive view of childrearing, which is noteworthy, as Latinx communities are suffering from especially high rates of COVID-19 ( Hubler  et al., 2020). Stress, anxiety, and depression from job and income loss may be reflective of an increase in financial hardship and economic pressure, especially for those with lower income and socioeconomic status due to their precarious jobs, with implications that extend to all aspects of life, including family dynamics and parent-child relationships."
"58" "Limitations"
"59" "As any observational studies, this cross-sectional online survey is bound to have limitations that warrant caution in interpreting results. First, a cross-sectional data would never be able to claim causality. However, information on outcome measures asked in reference to since COVID-19, coupled with the information on precarious parental employment reference to the timeframe before COVID-19, might allow us to at least partially address the limitations associated with the use of cross-sectional data. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that all retrospective information is bound to have recall bias (Groves, 1989). Retrospective parental reports are valuable mainstays of developmental science literature, but their accuracy may be moderated by domain, child age, person, and metric of agreement (Bornstein et al., 2018). Second, we have adopted a comprehensive and multidimensional approach to define precarious employment in this study. However, due to our online data collection approach, we did not collect information on parents’ wages or salaries which were included in the original EPRES scale and which would allow us to strengthen the dimension of low material reward aspect of the precarious employment. In addition, due to data availability, we were not able to distinguish between different  types of nonstandard work schedules. Previous studies have reported that nighttime hours or irregular schedules might be particularly adversely associated with parental and child well-being (Li et al., 2014). If anything, our estimates might then underestimate the links between nonstandard work schedules and parenting and child happiness. Third, due to resource constraints and the nature of online data collection, we used shorter versions of scales to measure outcome variables. For example, we only asked two questions related to child happiness, not to mention that we did not collect information on broader child well-being indicators, such as socioemotional functions (e.g., internalizing and externalizing behaviors). Importantly, child happiness in this study was reported by parents and parental mental states may have shaped parental perceptions of child happiness, although we controlled for parental mental health."
"60" "Conclusion"
"61" "The United States, along with the rest of the world, is experiencing a devastating public health crisis that has threatened not only our lives but also our economic security. The close link between parental work and their interactions with their children and thus their child well-being, warrants our immediate and sustained attention not only during times of economic prosperity but even more so during times of economic crisis. Our study does not attempt to prove the causal links between precarious parental employment, economic hardship during public health crisis, and the consequential parenting and child happiness. Instead, we conducted this study in the hopes of (re)shaping our conversations about the importance of parental employment and how unfavorable parental employment conditions, such as a precarious one that is prevalent in the labor market around the world, may compromise not only our parental views on childrearing but also the well-being of the future generations of workforce."
"62" "During such an unprecedented time,  the effects of COVID-19 on parenting stress and child and family well-being are of significant concern, especially considering  the typical coping strategies and  protective measures once utilized to manage adversity and reduce parenting stress may not be as accessible as they once were before this pandemic. With schools and childcare centers closed or significantly altered due to the pandemic, parents are tasked with managing significantly more than they had been before the pandemic, on top of the intensified economic stress they are experiencing at the hands of a reeling economy. Unsurprisingly, the COVID-19 pandemic is taking a toll on mental health and well-being across the country, but what is especially noteworthy is the way in which job precarity has exacerbated parenting stress and threatened child well-being. Such risk factors are of particular concern during a time when the usual protective factors may not be as accessible and typical routines and responsibilities are drastically disrupted. Those who were more vulnerable to begin with, are now suffering the consequences of such a dramatic increase in precarious employment pre-pandemic and potentially even an expansion of it as a result of pandemic (Pilkington & Rao, 2020). With an unprecedented economic landscape, now is the time to closely examine the magnitude of job precarity while we  pave  a way forward into unchartered territory before the consequences become normalized and expand in both breadth and scope."
