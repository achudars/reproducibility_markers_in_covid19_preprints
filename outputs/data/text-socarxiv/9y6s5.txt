Abstract
With the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic all over Europe during the first months of 2020, most
of the European governments imposed restrictive measures to people mobility and physical distance
(the lockdown), which severely impacted on the economic activities and performance of many
countries. Thus, the health emergency turned rapidly into in an economic crisis. The Covid-19 crisis
in Europe increased the uncertainty about the economic recovery and the end of the health emergency.
This situation is supposed to have conditioned individuals’ life course path with the effect of inducing
people to postpone or to abandon many life plans.
This paper aims to explore whether the rise of health emergency due to the Covid-19 has delayed or
vanished young people intention to leave the parental home during the 2020 in five European
countries: Italy, Germany, France, Spain and UK. Using data from an international survey from the
“Youth Project”, carried out by the Toniolo Institute of Advanced Studies, this paper implements
ordered logistic models in order to investigate the determinants of a possible revision of the choice
of leaving the parental home for a representative sample of 6,000 respondents aged 18 to 34,
interviewed between March and April 2020. A special focus has been pointed on the Italian case,
because of being the first European country to be strongly hit by the pandemic and because of the
already economic vulnerable conditions of its young population.
Results reports that Italy is the country with the highest rate of downward revisions of the intentions
of leaving the nest. In particular, having negative expectations about changes in the individual’s and
family’s future income is a key predictor of the choice of abandoning the purpose of leaving the
parental home across Europe. However, the vulnerability of the category of temporary workers arises
especially in Italy: young people with precarious jobs seems to be the most prone to negatively revise
their intentions of leaving, even compared with those not working.

Introduction
Economic recessions tend to prolong the time needed for young people to make their transition to
adulthood. The 2008 Great Recession has largely shown the mechanisms at work: because economic
crises especially reduce youth employment opportunities (Bell and Blanchflower 2011; Schoon and
Bynner 2017), the pre-existing tendency towards prolonged education participation and precarious
occupations has been accentuated. This process resulted, for many young people, into a postponement
of some life events such as reaching housing and economic independence from the family of origin.
These effects have been especially evident among Southern European countries, and particularly in
Italy (Sironi 2018), where the effect of the economic recession summed up with an unfavourable
labour market situation, scarce welfare state provisions and a struggling economic system. In this
context of less-protective transition regimes (i.e. from youth to adulthood), the result has been a strong
increase of the youth unemployment rate, the spread of involuntary temporary occupations and the
enlargement of the subgroup of young individuals neither in employment nor in education or training
(NEET) (e.g. Schoon and Bynner 2019). All these conditions have been found related with a lower
propensity to undertake the traditional steps toward the transition to adulthood (Rosina et al. 2007,
Sironi and Rosina 2015, Vignoli et al. 2012, Vignoli et al. 2013, Vignoli et al. 2016).
The Covid-19 health crisis, which picked in Europe with the lockdown restrictions implemented in
most of the European countries between February and March 2020, had suddenly translated into a
severe global economic crisis. Because of the previous considerations, even though we cannot
assimilate the Covid-19 related economic turndown with the 2008 Great Recession, we can expect
that this economic crisis will strongly hit – again – the young population, threatening their life plans.
In particular, the decision to exit the parental home especially requires reaching some economic
independence, which can be easily compromised during an economic recession period.
The aim of the present study is to explore the variation in the intention of leaving the parental home
as a consequence of the Covid-19 crisis, among a set of five European countries (i.e. Italy, France,
2

Germany, Spain and UK). In particular, we investigate whether previous individual’s occupational
condition and the expected effect of the crisis on the individual’s and family’s income impact on the
decision of withdrawing or postponing the plan of acquiring a housing independence. Further, we
specifically focus on the Italian case: leaving the nest usually happens later in Italy than in other
Western European countries, the effect of the economic uncertainty generated by the current crisis
might even exacerbate this phenomenon. Additionally, in our sample, Italy is the country where the
economic conditions, the labour market structure and the type of welfare regime create a particular
unfriendly environment for young people to get their economic independence and security. The
analyses have been conducted on data coming from an international survey on representative samples
of the young population (18-34) of the five European countries. The interviews have been conducted
between March 27 and April 7 2020, when the lockdown restrictions had been already adopted in
most of the considered countries.

Background
Leaving the parental home is one of the first steps in the transition to adulthood. This typically
happens for reasons such as studying in another city/country, because the individual reaches an
economic independence from the family of origin, or because of starting a cohabitation with a partner
(Billari, Philipov, and Baizán 2001; De Jong Gierveld, Liefbroer, and Beekink 1991). Historically,
the age of leaving the family of origin has grown over time, particularly since the late Sixties of the
last Century, due to the institutional and values changes that took place in Western societies in that
period (Aassve et al. 2002; Furstenberg 2010; Settersten et al. 2008; Sironi and Furstenberg 2012,
Lesthaeghe and Van de Kaa 1986). The increased family investment in children, the prolonged time
spent by children in the education system, the desire of finding a job that matches their qualification,
and, last but not least, the increased well-being of the families of origin are among the factors that
have contributed to postpone the “right” time of leaving the parental home (Buchmann and Kriesi
3

2011; Sironi 2015). Almost unavoidable it is the prerequisite of having acquired the economic selfsufficiency or getting access to the financial support of the family of origin or of a partner
(Goldscheider and Goldscheider 1993; Aassve et al. 2002; Iacovou 2010). On the contrary, young
people tend to stay longer in the parental home if leaving would increase their poverty risk (Aassve
et al. 2007).
Consequently, the kind of job young people get access when entering the labour market contributes
to determine the chance of gaining financial and housing independence from the family of origin. As
a result of the globalization process, the structure of the labour market has changed dramatically since
the last 30 years, by increasing occupational uncertainty at every stage of the work career, but
especially for those entering the labour market for the first time (Mills and Blossfeld 2003). Young
people, in fact, usually experience greater difficulties in getting a job and higher instability of their
positions and contracts if compared to those with longer working histories (Blanchflower and
Freeman 2000; Breen 2005; Brzinsky-Fay 2007; Gangl 2002; Scherer 2005).
The intention of staying or leaving the family of origin may depend also on macro-level socioeconomic and cultural factors. Several studies have stressed the role of contextual variables such as
the structure of the labour market, the dominant values system and the type of welfare state.
The labour market condition has a strong power in explaining the different timing of leaving the
parental home across countries (Aassve et al., 2002, 2010), because having a stable job and/or
experiencing low risk of unemployment is a precondition for reaching a financial autonomy. On the
contrary, a context where young people are at high risk of unemployment discourages from leaving
the parental home. This mechanism at least partially explains the lower propensity of young Italians
to make this step towards the adulthood: Italy, in fact, is the European countries with the highest
proportion of NEET - i.e. young people nor Employed neither in Education or Training – (in 2019,
among those aged 15 to 34, the percentage of NEETs in Italy was 23.8 while the EU28 average was
13.6. Source: Eurostat). Their incidence has especially risen as effect of the 2008 Great Recession,
4

which increased youth unemployment through hitting temporary contracts, largely widespread among
young, low-skilled workers (Lin et al. 2013, Sironi and Rosina 2015).
Welfare policies can act positively in reducing the uncertainty due to unfavourable conditions of the
labour market, and thus supporting young people in their transition towards financial autonomy. It
has been widely shown in the literature that the type of welfare state is linked to different timing and
paths to adulthood (Buchmannand Kriesi 2011, Sironi 2015), with the most generous welfare systems
effectively promoting the process of leaving the parental home. By referring to the Esping-Andersen
typology (Esping- Andersen 1990), in the cluster of Southern Europeans countries the transition to
adulthood happens later in life if compared to countries characterized by other types of welfare
regimes (Aassve et al. 2002, 2006; Aassve and Lappegård 2009; Billari 2004; Billari et al. 2001;
Esping-Andersen 1990; Mills et al. 2008; Mulder et al. 2002). In this cluster of countries, and in the
Italian case in particular, the welfare system is not particularly generous towards young people
(Rosina et al., 2007, Barbieri 2011). Therefore, usually the low provision of support provided by the
welfare state is balanced by the family support network (Mayer 2001; Trifiletti 1999). Consequently,
young people in familialistic countries tend to minimize their income risk by relying on family
support and postponing the leaving from the parental home (Blossfeld et al. 2005). Obviously, this is
conditional to the economic and social situation of the family of origin, and in particular its possibility
to financially support child’s decision of reaching a housing independency (De Long Gierveld;
Liefbroer and Beekink 1991, Santarelli and Cotone 2009).
The institutional setting conditions the transition to adulthood also through the values system, which
is implicit in the everyday social interactions, especially in the family context. Parental attitudes and
value orientation (Goldscheider and Goldscheider 1989; Surkyn and Lastehaeghe 2004) guide the
evaluation of the preconditions and the timing for leaving the parental home. Cultural differences are
wide across countries. In Italy, as in the Southern European countries, the family relationships, and
in particular those between parents and children, are especially solid, because they often are the
5

primary source of emotional and material support for young adults (Dalla Zuanna 2001, Dalla Zuanna
and Micheli 2004). As already said, this special type of intra-family relationship derives also by the
institutional setting - and the type of welfare state in particular – whose inefficiency in supporting
young people economic independence is often compensated by the support provided by the family
network.
The economic cycle phase also matters; recessions, in fact, have the power to increase the difficulties
in making the transition to adulthood. This happens because young people are extremely financially
vulnerable to economic crises (Aassve et al. 2013, Bell et al. 2011; Cho and Newhouse 2013, Sironi
2018; Grusky et al. 2011; Hout et al. 2011; Mínguez et al. 2017; O’Higgins 2014; Verick 2009).
Those working before the crisis are usually employed in sectors that are particularly affected by
recessions (O’Higgins 2014; Verick 2009). Additionally, because employed young people are at the
beginning of their work career, they usually rely on informal or temporary contracts, which are easily
at risk of ending during these problematic periods (Marcus and Gavrilovic 2010). Finally, those who
did not enter the labour market yet face increased difficulties in finding a job, while if they finally
succeed to get an occupation it is usually very precarious (Sironi 2018). Because recessions
undermine the occupational stability and the prospect and real earnings of young people (Sironi
2018), which are prerequisites for gaining a financial and housing autonomy, most of them postpone
the steps towards the transition to adult during economic crises (Aassve et al. 2002, Bell et al. 2007,
Iacovu 2010, Fustenberg 2010). However, recessions do not hit the young population uniformly.
Differences in the impact of recessions on the young population may depend on the type of welfare
regime and values system. More protective and generous welfare regimes towards young generations
(e.g. sustaining the transition from education to labour market, providing income and housing support,
etc.) tend to reduce the economic uncertainty and vulnerability derived by the economic crises
(Schoon and Bynner 2019). In less protective welfare regimes, such as in Southern Europe, given the
occupational and income instability due to the recession, young people may decide simply to prolong
6

their stay in the parental home to avoiding any additional income risks derived by the crisis (Sironi
2018).
Data, methods and variables
Data used in this study come from the ‘‘Youth Project’’, a survey started in 2011 within the financial
support and the partnership of the Toniolo Institute of Advanced Studies and CARIPLO Foundation
and with IPSOS LTD as executive and technical partner. In 2020, an international survey promoted
within the ‘‘Youth Project’’, focuses on the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on the life course
plans of a representative sample of the population of European young adults (people aged 18 to 34).
A sample of 6,000 European young adults participated in the research. Among them 2,000 come from
Italy and 1,000 come from each of the following European countries: UK, Germany, France, Spain.
The interviews have been conducted between March 27-31, 2020 in Italy and April 2-7, 2020 in the
other countries. The survey was realized using quotas sampling: quotas (defined using variables such
as gender, age, geographical origin, education, marital status, etc.) are designed to reflect the
population and are representative of the country’s population after having corrected frequencies
through a weighting procedure. The interviews were carried using CAWI method (Computer Aided
Web Interviewing: the questionnaire is online available; the interviewee opens the webpage and
automatically answers the questions that appear on the screen. More technical details are available at
https://www.rapportogiovani.it/osservatorio/).

The 2020 international survey includes a set of items exploring European young adults’ perspectives
on their life plans for the same year (e.g. leaving the parental home, conceiving a child, getting
married, started a cohabitation with the partner, moving to another country, changing the current job).
This paper focuses on the decision of European young adults to leave the parental home during 2020
and on how they reconsidered the plan in light of the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Hence, the
sample explored in the data analysis is restricted to the subset of individuals who live with their family
of origin at the time of the interview (March/April 2020) and who were considering going to live on
their own at the beginning of the year (January 2020).
As shown in Table 1, different patterns of living arrangements characterized the five sampled
countries. With respect to the residential condition, in Italy the percentage of young adults who still
live within the family origin at the time of the interview is greater than in the other countries (48.9%),
but similar to the Spanish case (44%). This result confirms the Southern European habit of leaving
the nest later, at least if compared with the other countries considered in this study: in Germany,
France and U.K, in fact, the percentage of individuals living with the parents is less than 30% in our
sample. This gap in the proportion of those who have already achieved housing self-sufficiency across
countries has been linked in the literature to the different occupational vulnerability experienced by
the young workforce. The material deprivation, due to higher youth unemployment and precarious
jobs rates, has been recognized as one of the main reasons for the delay in leaving the parental home.

Table 2 shows the proportion of individuals in the sample who were considering going to live on their
own before the beginning of Covid-19 emergency. As we can see from the table, the percentage of
individuals intentioned to leave the parental home before the beginning of the pandemic is lower than
the percentage of those who were intentioned. Only apparently surprising is the results of Italy, who
displays the highest rate of people intentioned to leave the nest. The result is related to what we have
discussed in Table 1: Italy is the country with the higher proportion of individuals still living with
their parents (and having postponed in the past years); consequently, we observe also the highest
potential of individuals who aim at joining the residential autonomy.

The result in Table 3 focuses on the central point of this study, which is the decision to confirm or to
revise the intention of leaving the parental home, considering the crisis due to Covid-19 pandemic:
the analysed subsample is focused on the individuals that reported a positive intention of leaving the
parental home in January 2020. The Covid-19 emergency has had a strong impact in depressing the
purposes of the interviewed individuals: in all the European countries the percentage of those who
postponed or abandoned the plan of leaving the parental home exceed sharply the percentage of those
who confirm their plan.
Although the pandemic has a generalized impact of delaying or denying the choice of young adults
of going to live on their own, some specificities at the country level arise. In particular, Italy performs
9

worse with regard to the other countries, showing the highest proportion of young adults who revised
the intention of exiting from the parental home: 45.6% of the respondents decided to postpone their
plans, while 34.7% of them totally abandoned the idea. Coherently with the expectations, in this
framework, Spain is the runner up in the ranking of intentions revised: 29.2% of respondents renounce
to going to live on their own.
Nevertheless, the economic instability and the sense of uncertainty due to the spread of Covid-19 also
hit the young people plans in countries like Germany and UK. In France, the effect of the pandemic
seems to be milder, even if the higher fraction of those who declare of postponing the plan
counterbalance those who renounce to their purpose.

The paper aims at testing the role played by socio-demographic characteristics and by the perception
of future economic conditions deriving from the Covid-19 emergency on the individuals’ decision to
confirm or not the purpose of going to live on their own.
Hence, the dependent variable of the model is the one presented in Table 3, with three possible levels
of responses j hierarchically ordered from the most optimistic point of view related to the intentions
of leaving the parental home (j=1) to the less optimistic one (j=3), which overlaps with the choice of

10

a complete renounce to the intention of leaving the nest. In more detail the following is the pool of
available levels for variable j:
-

Confirmation of the plan [of going to live outside the family of origin] - (j=1)

-

Postponement of the plan [that is formally confirmed, but delayed for what concerning the
date of departure] - (j=2);

-

Abandonment (suspended sine die) of the plan to reach residential autonomy. Two different
model specifications are used in order to model the responses of the outcome variable - (j=3).

Two different model specifications are then presented: (1) the model assuming ordinality of the
outcomes and the parallel line assumption. This model is also well-known as an ordered logistic
model; (2) a more flexible model which provides unbiased and consistent estimates even if the parallel
line assumption does not hold, which is well knows in literature as the generalized logistics regression
(Williams, 2016).
1) Let Yi be the outcome for the individual i: under the ordinality assumption of the response
outcome in three different levels (each of them is equal to j, with j=1,2,3), the model assumes
the following form:

Pr(𝑌 ≤ 𝑗|𝑋 ) = 𝐹(𝑋 𝛽) =

exp (𝛼 + 𝑋 𝛽)
1
=1−
1 + exp (𝛼 + 𝑋 𝛽)
1 + exp (𝛼 + 𝑋 𝛽)

Pr(𝑌 > 𝑗|𝑋 ) = 1 − 𝐹(𝑋 𝛽) =

exp (𝛼 + 𝑋 𝛽)
1 + exp (𝛼 + 𝑋 𝛽)

with j=1,2,3
Where the 𝑋 is the set of regressors for the respondent i and β are the coefficients of the
independent variables to estimate. The model specified above is the correct one if the parallel
line assumption holds. The parallel line assumption states that parameters β should not change

11

for different categories j. If it does not happen, then the size of the coefﬁcients of some
explanatory variables depends on the cut-off points of the dependent variable.
A Brant test (Brant, 1990) has been implemented, in order to verify whether the parallel line
assumption holds or not, showing that in every model for at least one variable parallel line is
violated1.
2) With respect to those coefficients that do not pass the Brant test and for which the parallel line
assumption condition does not hold, generalized logistic regression estimates are used in order
to replace the ordered logistic ones. In more detail, this model allows to perform different
strategies to treat variables that fail the parallel line assumptions and those not violating that
condition. More speciﬁcally, if the parallel line assumption holds, the coefﬁcient estimates
are the same as from an ordered logistic model. If the parallel line assumption fails, a series
of cumulative logit models have been run: the original ordinal variable is collapsed into two
categories and a series of binary logistic regressions are estimated. First, it is category 1
(confirmation) versus categories 2 and 3 (postponement or abandonment); then it is category
1 and 2 (confirmation or postponement) versus category 3 (abandonment); the model, as in
Williams (2016) assumes the following specification:
Pr(𝑌 > 𝑗|𝑋 ) = 1 − 𝐹 𝑋 𝛽

=

exp (𝛼 + 𝑋 𝛽 )
1 + exp (𝛼 + 𝑋 𝛽 )

As we can see we relax in this case the hypothesis that coefficients β are constant for every
level j of the dependent variable. If we consider a generic level j and we require the probability
of joining the threshold j, we obtain:
Pr(𝑌 = 𝑗|𝑋 ) =

1

exp (𝛼 + 𝑋 𝛽 )
exp (𝛼 + 𝑋 𝛽 )
−
1 + exp (𝛼 + 𝑋 𝛽 ) 1 + exp (𝛼 + 𝑋 𝛽 )

This result mentioned in the text is omitted from the tables of simple ordered regressions.

12

Replacing j with the numeric levels 1, 2 and 3 we will have that:
Pr(𝑌 = 1|𝑋 ) = 1 −

Pr(𝑌 = 2|𝑋 ) =

exp (𝛼 + 𝑋 𝛽 )
1 + exp (𝛼 + 𝑋 𝛽 )

exp (𝛼 + 𝑋 𝛽 )
exp (𝛼 + 𝑋 𝛽 )
−
1 + exp (𝛼 + 𝑋 𝛽 ) 1 + exp (𝛼 + 𝑋 𝛽 )

Pr(𝑌 = 3|𝑋 ) =

exp (𝛼 + 𝑋 𝛽 )
1 + exp (𝛼 + 𝑋 𝛽 )

In both the cases estimates of parameters β are obtained using a Maximum Likelihood Estimation.
Procedure.
The vector of variables Xi, which is used in the empirical analysis includes the following predictors:
Gender: by distinguishing among males and females, we take into account that the trajectories
characterizing the transition to adulthood may differ by gender.
Age: we grouped the individuals in three age classes: 18-24, 25-29 (reference category) and 30-34.
Education: we distinguish young adults who achieved a tertiary level of education (bachelor, master
or Ph. D) from those that achieved an upper secondary education (with a 4 or 5 years high school
diploma) and from a residual group including those that have lower levels of education (lower
secondary or primary).
Geographical area: it is an explanatory variable introduced, in order to take into account the
geographical heterogeneity and the impact of unobservable context variables. In the European context
we consider the five biggest countries in terms of population size: Italy (which is the reference
category), Germany, France; UK and Spain. In the subsequent analysis which focuses only on the
Italian context country dummies are replaced with macroregional dummies (NUTS 1 level):
Northwest (reference), Northeast, Centre, South and Islands.
Employment status: a key variable which is strongly related with the available economic resources.
We consider five categories: students, NEETs, temporary workers (employees with a fixed term job),

13

permanent employees (employees without a contract expiration date) and self-employed (a category
including young entrepreneurs and freelancers, which has been chosen as the reference category).
Perceived future income and job conditions: it is a variable which explores respondents’ expectation
about their future job and the future income of their family. The question used for building the variable
collects the answers to the following question: “Looking to the future, do you think the current
coronavirus emergency will have a positive or negative impact? a) on your family’s income b) on
your job. For each item five alternatives answers have been provided in the questionnaire: 1) Very
negative, 2) Somewhat negative, 3) No change, 4) Somewhat positive, 5) Very positive.
Starting from the five possible answers for the two explored items we create a unique variable with
four categories:
-

“Neutral or positive”, whether the respondents’ answer was 3), 4) or 5) for both the items a)
and b).

-

“Negative for me”, whether the respondents’ answer was 3), 4) or 5) for item a) and 1) or 2)
for item b).

-

“Negative for me and my family”, whether the respondents’ answer 1) or 2) for item a) and
3), 4) or 5) for item b)

-

“Negative for me and my family”, whether the respondents’ answer was 1) or 2) for both the
items a) and b).

Youth unemployment rate: it is the youth unemployment measured at regional level (NUTS1 or
NUTS2 according to the minimum level of aggregation allowed in the Youth Report data. Source:
Eurostat) in 2019; it has been added in the econometric model as a macroeconomic control variable
with the role of being an alternative to the use of geographical area dummies, as indicator of the
presence of a favourable or unfavourable labour market.

A final issue concerning the choice of the model is the question of selectivity, related to the fact that
the analysis of the intentions is realized on the sub-sample of those who expressed a positive
14

intentions of going to live on their own. Specifying that the aim of this paper is descriptive and
exploratory, not causal, a provisional analysis on the distribution of the variables related with the key
explanatory variables (employment and education) does not show large differences between the full
sample and the subset used in the analysis.

Empirical Results
This section reports the empirical results and the estimates of parameters β in the case parallel lines
assumptions are satisfied or less. Three specifications of the model are presented: the first one (Model
1) only includes the socio-demographic variables (gender, age, education, employment status and
country of origin), while the second model (Model 2) adds the variable related to the perceived future
job/income conditions of the respondents and his family. Finally, a third model (Model 3) has been
also introduced, replacing the country dummies with the youth unemployment rates at regional level
in 2019. The aim is to explore whether more or less favourable labour market conditions – given the
same individual’s employment situation –impact on the decision to revise the original plan.
The European sample – Ordered logit
Table 4 reports the estimates of an ordered logistic regression for the full European sample. Results
from Model 1 are partially in line with the expectations: Italy and Spain, net of the other covariates,
are the countries that show the highest probability of postponing or abandoning the purpose of leaving
the parental home. In this framework, the coefficient for UK is not significantly different from that
of Italy and Spain, while people living in Germany and France are more likely to confirm the intention
of going to live on their own. Females seem to be more likely to postpone their plans, even if the next
models do not confirm the result2. With respect to the relationships between the likelihood of revising
the plans of residential autonomy and education we notice an inverted U-shaped curve: individuals

All the models have been tested separately on women and men. However, because of the small sample size, all the
coefficients turn non-significant.

with a tertiary education are less likely to change their plans as well as those with primary or lower
secondary education: in this context, those with an upper secondary education seem to be most
worried by the emergency. Temporary workers seem to be another penalized category, even if the
result is only marginally significant in Model 1 and become irrelevant in Model 2. In Model 2, the
perceived future income conditions are precondition for the revision of the intentions to leave the
parental home. In particular, those with negative expectations on their personal future income and on
both the personal and family’s future income experience a higher probability of revising their
intentions of leaving the parental home.
Finally, we found that higher level of the regional youth unemployment rate in 2019 predicts higher
propensity to abandon or postpone the plan of leaving the parental home (Model 3): the occupational
opportunities are important in reducing the perceived risk derived by taking the decision to leave even
under the condition of great economic uncertainty.

The Italian sample – Ordered logit
Table 5 focuses on the Italian sub-sample. Results highlight the relevance of some explanatory
variables - such as the employment status and the expectations on the future income - in the Italian
context.
In both Model 1 and Model 2, age and gender do not significantly relate with the revision of the
autonomy plans. Also the macro-regional context of residence does not matter with respect to the
process of revision of the intentions of leaving the parental home. Hence, the significant variables are
once again the education, the employment status and, for what concerns Model 2, the income
forecasts. About education, results of the Italian subset confirm what has been found in the European
sample: individuals with upper secondary education are more likely to abandon or delay their plan of
leaving the parental home. Results for the employment status reveal the peculiarity of the Italian
16

context compared to the other European countries: the category of temporary workers seems to be
the most discouraged in confirming the plan to leave the nest. Also, the category of the students
performs worse than the other groups (i.e. permanent workers, self-employed and NEETs). When
interpreting the findings for NEETs we need to consider that this subgroup is extremely
heterogeneous, as it encompasses both unemployment and inactivity due to many reasons (childcare,
taking a “gap year”, because they are discouraged, etc.), which are associated with different levels of
economic vulnerability (Mascherini and Ledermaier, 2016).
Finally, results for the expected effect of the crisis on the personal and the family future are in line
with the ones from the full European sample: a negative expectation on the individual future income
induces a downward review of the plans for the Italian young adults. If the negative projections also
involve the expected income of the parents, the decision of abandoning or postponing the choice to
leave the nest is more likely to happen.

The European sample – Generalized Ordered logit
As previously said, a Brant test has been implemented with the result of violation of parallel line
assumption for several variables. This means that for the variables for which the condition does not
hold, we have different values of the estimates of coefficients β for each of the cumulative logit
models which have replaced the original ordered one; the original ordinal variable is collapsed into
two categories and a couple of binary logistic regressions are estimated. The first one contrasts
category j = 1 (confirmation of the plan) with a joint category for levels 2 and 3 (postponement or
abandonment). The second one contrasts categories j = 1, 2, which are collapsed in a unique category,
against j = 3.
The analysis starts with the full set of the five European countries in Table 6. Results substantially
confirm those we have obtained in Table 4 with few but remarkable differences. With respect to
macroeconomic variables, youth unemployment rate confirms to be significant, even if significance
19

disappears when country dummies are included in the model3. Therefore, the residual variations
across countries in the propensity to change the original plans might be better explained by more
general contextual characteristics such as the demographic trends (prior to the pandemic), the
economic situation, the labour market structures, the house market condition, the welfare support and
the cultural context. In particular, young adults from France and Germany are less likely to abandon
or to postpone the decision to going living on their own. The model displayed in Table 5 shows an
interesting result referring to Spain; differently form the ordered logistic model, the opportunity of
relaxing parallel line assumption allows for discussing a more articulated pattern or preferences.
Spanish young adults are not significantly different from Italian ones when we compare the decision
of confirming the purpose of leaving home with the alternative of delaying or abandoning the plan.
However, when we split the alternative of abandoning from that of delaying and we contrast
abandoning vs. delay/confirmation the results changes, showing Spaniards being less likely to
abandon their purpose and generally more optimistic than Italians.
A more complex pattern of preferences concerns the variable on perceived future income conditions.
When we control for youth unemployment rate, a negative perspective on the future of both individual
and household income reinforce the choice of abandoning the purpose of leaving away with respect
to the choice of simply delaying that choice.
Finally, generalized logit provides an interesting pattern of results for the role of education and
specifically for the group of lower educated individuals. While individuals with a secondary
education keep showing a higher probability of delaying or abandoning the intentions of departing,
lower educated individuals are less likely to opt for a delay compared to higher educated ones. In the
model contrasting the choice of confirming to postponing/abandoning the coefficient is negative,
indicating that lower educated young adults are more likely to confirm. When we contrast the choice
of confirming or delaying the intentions versus the most radical choice of abandoning the plan, the
3

This finding is obtained implementing a regression analysis with the joint presence of geographical area dummies and
youth unemployment rate. The details of that model are omitted in Table 6.

20

coefficient changes the sign and become positive, indicating a preference for renouncing to the
purpose of exiting from the parental home. In both the cases, the lower educated individuals seem to
polarize their preferences toward the two opposite alternatives: leaving the parental home even in
presence of Covid-19 emergency or totally renounce to the plan.

The Italian sample – Generalized Ordered logit
The Italian sample reflects the result from the European countries with some peculiarities, confirming
the results from the Ordered Logit. Students and temporary workers are more likely to delay or
abandon the plan of leaving the parental home. The situation appears critical especially for those who
have fixed term jobs, a condition which often becomes chronical in Italy and which is the basis of the
delay of several events in Italians’ life course path. Hence, the presence of a precarious employment
condition seems to be the main predictor for risk of postponement or of the abandonment of the
purpose of joining the residential autonomy. In this context, being precarious increases the risk of
revising the life plan even more than for the group of NEETs. Anyway, as already discussed, the
category of NEET is extremely heterogeneous, which makes difficult to find a general explanation
for the lower propensity to revise their plans.
In this framework, it is important to underline as regional context does not matter when we consider
the scenario of Covid-19 pandemic in Italy. Indeed, both the regional dummies and the youth regional
unemployment rate are not significant. Probably, the higher incidence of cases in Lombardy, Veneto
and Emilia Romagna, which are among the wealthier regions, have decreased the expectations also
here, by flattening the regional gap.
Generalized logit estimates are particularly interesting for what concerning the role of gender and
education. Unlike what was found in the European sample, in Italy gender differences matter, with
females that are more likely to abandon the choice of leaving home in the model contrasting levels of
j = 1, 2 (confirmation/delay) vs. j =3 (abandonment). This means that females declare to be less
optimistic with the perspective of going to live on their own. Upper secondary educated individuals
21

are more likely to abandon their leaving plan only in the model where those postponing and still
planning are jointly considered against those who totally abandoned their plan.
Finally, as in the European subset, a negative perception of the future income for the respondents and
their family increase the likelihood of abandoning the plan instead of confirming or delaying it.
Therefore, the negative effects of future income and of a temporary employment status emphasize
the key role of expectations, more than the actual conditions, in modifying the individuals’ plans.

Conclusions
This study offers an explorative analysis of the possible effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on the young
population projects of leaving the parental home. As far as we know, this is the first study on the topic
conducted on international representative samples of the young population (18-34) of five European
countries4. Results from our paper suggest that precarious employment situation and bad perspective
financial conditions of the young individuals and their families are associated with a negative revision
of their intention of leaving the parental home because of the Covid-19 related economic crisis. This
path is particularly stressed in the Italian case. Here, having a temporary job and feeling insecure
about the future financial situation are strong predictors of a downward revision of the original plan
about reaching housing autonomy. These results seem to confirm the idea that both the objective
conditions of the present and the perception of uncertainty about the future count on the life plans of
young people.
In particular, the vulnerability of temporary workers needs to be taken into serious consideration by
policy makers, especially because this condition is dominant for those entering in the labour market
(Standing, 2011; Ashton, 2017; Bloodworth, 2018). Fixed-term, temporary and zero-hour contracts
are particularly common among the youngest, 16 to 24 year-olds (Eurostat, 2017), and in countries
such as Spain, Italy and Germany. However, while in Germany temporary contracts are often
transitory to permanent contracts, in Italy and Spain temporary contracts are involuntary in most of
the cases and less frequently end up into permanent jobs (Mascherini et al. 2013). A standing-alone
case is the UK, where temporary contracts are much rarer than in other European countries, and in
one third of the cases even by worker’s choice (Schoon and Bynner 2019). This mirror the liberal

soul of the UK economy and the higher level of de-regularization of the labour market, where
dismissing is much easier than elsewhere.
Across countries, the propensity to revise the original plan of attaining a residential autonomy remains
higher in Italy, Spain and UK, even controlling for the occupational condition and the expected effect
of the crisis on the individual’s and family’s income. As argued, the institutional framework plays a
primary role in shaping the opportunities and the resources that young people can access to support
their transition towards the autonomy from the family of origin. The uncertainty brought by the
Covid-19 health and economic crisis can only magnify the contextual effect on this process.
Therefore, familialistic as liberal welfare regimes do not offer enough financial guarantees to reduce
the increased risk of leaving the nest during period of great (global) uncertainty. At the same time,
previous unfavourable conditions of both the economic system and the labour market do not provide
young people with a solid ground on which they can build their own house. Even though we still do
not have evidence on how the current pandemic and economic crisis will affect future concrete
behaviours, results from our study confirm the negative impact of the current recession at least on the
intentions of the young generations to pursue their life plans. Further studies are then needed to
estimate the impact of the current crisis on the actual realization of young generations life plans in
the next future. Still, our first empirical evidence suggests urgent policy interventions to support
young people in getting their economic and housing independence, especially in those countries
where the transition to adulthood was already an issue before the pandemic occurred.
