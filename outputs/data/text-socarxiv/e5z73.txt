"6" "ABSTRACT"
"7" "In this brief research article, I demonstrate how predictive analytics or machine learning can be used to predict outcomes that are of interest in public policy.  I  d evelop ed  a predictive model that  determined who were not able to work  during the past four weeks  because  the COVID-19 pandemic  led their employer to close or lose business .  I used  the Current Population Survey (CPS) collected from May to  November  2020  ( N= 352,278) . Predictive models considered were logistic regression and ensemble-based methods (bagging of regression trees, random forests, and boosted regression trees). Predictors included (1) individual-, (2) family-, (3) and community  or  societal -  level factors. To validate the models, I used the random training test splits with equal allocation of samples for the training and testing data. The random forest with the full set of predictors and number of splits set to the square root of the number of predictors yielded the lowest testing error rate.  Predictive analytics that seek to forecast the inability to work due to  the pandemic  can be used  for automated  means-testing  to determine who gets   aid like  unemployment benefits  or food stamps ."

"10" "INTRODUCTION"
"11" "As of Christmas, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected  18.66  million and claimed  329,023  lives  in the United States   (Dong et al., 2020) .  Not only did the  COVID-19  pandemic  disrupt health  and health service delivery, it also has brought to fore other existing problems in society such as race or ethnic, age, gender,  employment status,  disability status, place-based  and other forms of  disparities   (e.g., Alon et al. ,  2020; Carethers ,  2020; Jay et al. ,  2020; Polyakova et al. ,  2020; Tai et al. ,  2020; Turk et al. ,  2020) ."
"12" "This research note is focused on  COVID-19  and employment. According to a recent Congressional Research Service (CRS) report  (Falk et al. ,  2020)  that uses the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data , every US state and the District of Columbia had a higher unemployment rate in April than the Great Recession . Nationwide, the unemployment was 14.7  percent  in April versus 10.0  percent  in October 2009 – the highest unemployment rate observed  during  the Great Recession .  However, the BLS warns that numbers for March and April could be underestimates and those who were not working during the entire reference week of the survey due to COVID-19 restrictions regardless of  being  paid or not and those not in the labor force but want to get a job should be considered unemployed  (BLS ,  2020) .  Adjusting for these, the upper-bound of unemployment in April was 24.4  percent  - a little over 10  percent  of the official rate  (Couch , Fa irlie,  &  Xu,  2020) . By November, unemployment declined to 6.7  percent  but the rate is still considered elevated  (Falk et al. ,  2020) .  Higher unemployment rates were observed among younger workers, women, racial and ethnic minorities, those with lower education, and part-time workers   (Falk et al. ,  2020) . Web-scraped data showed that by April, job vacancy shrank by 40  percent  across all industries, the dip was  more severe for leisure and hospitality and non-essential retail sectors  (Forsythe et al. 2020) .  See  Handwerker et al. (2020)  for a useful review of the labor market effects of COVID-19."
"13" "This research note demonstrates how  predictive  analytics  using  supervised  machine learning techniques  can be used to  forecast  labor market outcomes, particularly the dichotomous outcome   of  whether a person was rendered unable to work because the workplace or own businesses went under  due to  the pandemic.  Such algorithms  that predict outcomes with precision  can be used  to compute social safety net program eligibility scores, which, in turn, may  facilitate the speedy release of the much needed aid during this difficult time ."
"14" "METHODS"
"15" "Data came from the Current Population Survey (CPS) data downloaded through the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS)   (Flood et al. ,  2020) . The CPS is a monthly phone or in-person survey of 60,000 eligible households conducted by the Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS). The monthly survey gathers demographic characteristics and labor market measures of household members who belong to the civilian noninstitutional population aged 16 and older and resides in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Households are in the survey for four months straight, out for the next eight months, and back in the survey for the next four months. In May 2020, the CPS has started asking questions about COVID-19’s impact on the labor market. I used data from May to  November  2020. After listwise deletion ,  excluding  those below 16 years of age, and  those in the armed forces ,  N= 352,278 ."
"16" "I aimed to predict the binary outcome  of  whether the respondent  was unable to work during the past four weeks because her  or  his employer closed or lost business due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  To determine the set of predictors, I used the  socio-ecological framework  which  has been used mostly to explain health outcomes  (Garbarino & Crouter ,  1978; Macintyre ,  Ellaway,  &  Cummin s,   2002)  but can also be applied to  employment outcomes   (Schoon & Lyons-Amos ,  2017) .  I categorized the predictors I used into: (1) individual-, (2) family-, (3) and community  or  societal -  level factors. I further categorized individual-level factors as basic demographic ( e.g.,  age, sex), labor market-related ( e.g.,  education, labor force status), and health-related ( e.g.,  disability status). Table 1 shows the predictors used."
"17" "[Insert Table 1 about here]"
"18" "Across all  predictive analytic techniques used , I entered the sets of predictors in increments such that the first model include d  the basic demographic factors, the second model include d  both the basic demographic factors and labor market factors, etc.  The techniques used in this paper fall under supervised machine learning algorithms  which involve feeding predictors to an algorithm that learns how to use the predictors to make predictions of the outcome   (James et al. ,  2013a) ."
"19" "First, I ran a series of logistic regressions. Logistic regression  has become the statistical model of choice when   forecasting dichotomous  outcomes   (Tu ,  1996) . Then, I ran   the three most popular ensemble-based models namely bagged regression trees or bagging, random forests, and boosted regression trees or boosting   (Yang et al. ,  2010) . Ensemble-based methods combine several individual pattern of classifiers to attempt to yield more accurate predictions than a standalone classifier model (in this case, tree-based models) but at the expense of interpretability   (Rokach ,  2010) . Bagging is just a special case of random forests with number of variables to randomly sample as candidates at each split  m  equal to the actual number of predictors  p.  Random forests improve on decision trees because it reduces the variance but the number of predictors considered  in bagging lead to high correlation among the trees being generated and combined. For the random forests,  m  is typically set below  p , usually   = p /2,  p /3, and  p 1/2 . In effect,  m>p  ensures that weaker predictors have a chance to be selected, which, in turn, decorrelates the trees in comparison to the bagging. Boosting further improves on the random forests by growing the trees sequentially or based on the information from the previous tree developed (see  James et al. ,  2013b)  for an introductory discussion of ensemble methods)."
"20" "I used the R statistical software version 4.0.3   (R Core Team ,  2020) . The  glm   function in the  stats   package   (R Core Team ,  2020)  was used for the logistic regression whereas  randomForest   package   (Liaw & Wiener ,  2002)  was used for bagging and random forests.   On the other hand, the  gbm   package   (Greenwell et al. ,  2020)  was used for boosting. For boosting, the shrinkage parameter λ=0.001 and interaction depth  d =1 through 4. The number of trees assigned were 100, 500, and 5,000 for the bagging, random forests, and boosting, respectively. All throughout the analyses, I have set seed to 10 for replicability.  The R script can be found in the Appendix ."
"21" "I used the random training test splits with equal allocation of samples for the training and testing data  which is a typical way of cross-validating predictive models  (Varian ,  2014) .  In this process, the models were ran using the training data. Then, said models were used to predict outcomes of the testing data.  The model that yield ed  the smallest testing classification error rate  was  deemed the most superior model.   Testing classification error rate is t he number of  un successful predictions  (i.e., false positives or false negatives)  divided by the total observations for the testing data served as the.   The  Bayes classifier   was used to  assign   each  respondent to the most likely outcome  (i.e., whether positive or negative)  conditional on the set of predictors  (i.e., conditional probability)   (James et al. ,  2013a) .  A conditional probability of 50  percent  or higher was considered a successful prediction."
"22" "RESULTS"
"23" "Table 2 shows the cross-validation results. In majority of the predictions ran, testing error declined as more predictors were added except in the case when family-related predictors were added to the models with all individual-level factors (see column D). The random forest using all the predictors (individual-, family-, and community-level factors),  m = p 1/2 , and 500 trees yielded the lowest testing error rate of 12. 12  percent . In other words, this random forest was  87.88  percent   accurate. Figure 1 shows the mean decrease in the Gini index or the variable importance of the said tree. Being unemployed, older, and an essential worker are the top three most important predictors in this random forest.  The  second-best  model was the logistic regression with the full set of predictors  that yielded a testing error rate of 12.21  percent ."

"26" "DISCUSSION"
"27" "P redictive analytics  work  done specifically for COVID-19 were  mostly  for forecasting the population at risk, diagnosis, and prognosis such as mortality risk, disease severity, and level of care needed  ( see for instance reviews by  Halamk a,  Cerrato,  &   Perlman ,  2020; Wynants et al. ,  2020) .  But in this  brief research article , I demonstrate d  that predictive analytics can be used to forecast  any outcomes   that were  adversely affected by COVID-19 .   I used  a labor market outcome, particularly the  binary outcome of whether the respondent was unable to work during the past four weeks because her  or  his employer closed or lost business due to the COVID-19 pandemic  as an example .   I used the socio-ecological  framework as a guide in determining my set of predictors.  Note that the point of the analyses here is to predict the outcome accurately, not uncover associations between variables   following  the algorithmic modeling culture  (Breiman, 2001)  but using the framework is a good place to start."
"28" "T he random forest  using  individual-, family-, and community  or  societal- level factors  as predictors   yielded the lowest testing error rate  of 12.11  percent . The drawback of the  random forest  is that it is  “a forest of a thousand trees cannot be easily interpreted  (Varian ,  2014) .”  On the other hand, the interpretable and commonly used  logistic regression with the full set of predictors  was the next best model in terms of precision, with a testing error rate of 12.21  percent ."
"29" "Knowing how to predict the risk of being unemployed due to tragic events like the pandemic can help governments target beneficiaries of  aid .  Targeting  ensures that  social safety net  programs  minimize leakages (i.e., giving benefits to those who do not need them) and  undercoverage  (i.e., failing to give benefits to those who need them) but at the same time ,  full means test  ( FMT )   for beneficiary identification can be costly   (Coady ,  Grosh,  &  Hoddi nott ,  2004) . Predictive analytic  models that perform well out of sample  can  be utilized in   developing tools for  proxy means testing  (PMT)  – the shortcut for  FMT that involves calculating a score from easily-observable household characteristics traditionally through regression or principal components analysis  (McBride & Nichols ,  2018) ."
"30" "The  gain in accuracy from using the random forest  instead of the logistic regression  was 0.10  percent  (12.11  percent  vs 12.21  percent ) .  The difference may seem too small to sacrifice the interpretability  and simplicity  that the logistic regression offers. However, putting it into the perspective of determining who is eligible  for social safety net programs, the  incorrectly misclassified  0.10  percent  of the  population  could easily translate to  thousands  of  beneficiaries losing out on the aid."
"31" "The  two major social safety net programs in the US that give significant amounts of support during  recessions  are the unemployment insurance (UI)  and the Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance  Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps  (see Moffitt & Ziliak ,  2020 for a COVID-19 related discussion of these programs) .  Unlike the $1,200 stimulus checks given  automatically  to adult s  earning less than $99,000 or $198,000 for joint filers through the  Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ( CARES )  Act  (US Department of Treasury ,  2020) , UI and SNAP benefits  are targeted and  have to be applied for.  UI provides those involuntarily unemployed a fraction of their past wages  for  certain time period if they meet some job search requirements  while those living under poverty with low assets are eligible for SNAP  (Moffitt & Ziliak ,  2020) .   Apart from the fraction of the lost wages, a n additional $600 was provided to UI recipients  because of the CARES Act  (Handwerker et al. ,  2020) . In the  current way of processing UI claims, all but three states met the federal standard of providing the benefits to 87  percent  of approved applicants within three weeks  (Henderson 2020) , meaning, many program applicants had to wait months to get their checks .  The  CARES Act  also  dealt away with SNAP’s three-month eligibility limit for those  childless and unemployed  under the age of 50 and allowed states to be flexible in its implementation , which, in turn, alleviated some churn   (Center on Budget and Policy Priorities ,  2020) . Delays in benefits mean a lot to struggling families – from missed meals to delayed rent payments  and eviction . Policy implementers should therefore consider exploiting the big data they have on citizens to  automatically provide  various social safety nets that are much needed during these unprecedented times. This has been done in the past: f or example, in 2010, Louisiana utilized the Express Lane Eligibility to automatically enroll about 10,000 children who were SNAP beneficiaries to Medicaid  since  many of the SNAP beneficiaries are eligible for Medicaid anyway   (Dorn et al. ,  2012) .  And since  budgets are finite ,  machine learning algorithms such as those presented in this  research  could be used  for PMT. The algorithm can help develop  a scoring mechanism such that those with the highest risk of losing their jobs due to COVID-19 and sinking into deep poverty , food insecurity,  eviction , etc.   could be prioritized  in the automatic provision of aid .   But even if there was  an automated system,  aid  applications  from those who did not automatically receive benefits  should  still be reviewed  since  predictive algorithms are never 100  percent  accurate."
"32" "Predictors do not necessarily have to be  as comprehensive as  what is  presented here, as long as testing (or out of sample) error rate  of the models are  minimized   (James et al. ,  2013b; Varian ,  2014)  and the algorithm should not propagate discrimination against protected groups  (Munoz , Smith, & Patil ,  2016) ."
