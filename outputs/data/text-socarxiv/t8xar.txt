Abstract
Crises and disasters give voters an opportunity to observe the incumbent’s response
and reward or punish them for successes and failures. Yet even when voters perceive
events similarly, they tend to attribute responsibility selectively, disproportionately
crediting their party for positive developments and blaming opponents for negative developments. Using original time series data, we show that partisan disagreement over
U.S. President Donald Trump’s responsibility for the COVID-19 pandemic quickly
emerged alongside the pandemic’s onset in March 2020. Three original survey experiments show that the valence of information about the country’s performance against
the virus contributes causally to such gaps. A Bayesian model of information processing anticipates our findings more closely than do theories of partisan-motivated
reasoning. These findings shed new light on selective attribution’s implications for
democratic accountability.

Crises and disasters give voters an opportunity to observe the incumbent’s response
and punish or reward them for successes and failures (Ashworth and Bueno De Mesquita
2014). Yet even when voters agree on the facts, they tend to attribute responsibility in a
selective manner. Compared to opposition voters, supporters of the incumbent party are
more likely to credit the government for positive outcomes and less likely to blame it for
negative outcomes. In contrast, opposition supporters more readily blame the government
for negative outcomes, and are less likely to credit it for positive outcomes. This sort of
selective punishing and rewarding performance is widely considered a threat to democratic
accountability (Healy and Malhotra 2013). In this article, we study selective attributions
of responsibility through the lens of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. We
find that partisan disagreement over then-President Donald Trump’s responsibility for the
pandemic emerged quickly alongside the initial outbreak in March 2020. Using a formal
proof and experimental evidence, we show that these differences can arise because voters
differ in their beliefs about the incumbent’s competence. These findings have implications
for democratic accountability.
Our analysis begins by providing the first evidence that partisan selectivity in attributions of responsibility (hereafter, “selective attribution”) emerges quickly as national crises
unfold. Using an original time series spanning the six weeks between the nation’s 500th confirmed COVID-19 case and its 500,000th, we show that as the reality of a national pandemic
set in, Democrats and Republicans changed their perceptions and behaviors in a near-parallel
fashion. However, even as Democrats increasingly blamed then-President Donald Trump for
the pandemic, Republicans held firm in assigning him little responsibility for it.
Since selective attribution could arise for a variety of reasons, we use three experiments
to test individual-level explanations for why these differences might emerge during a time of
relative consensus over the threat posed by the pandemic. Subjects were randomly assigned
to read vignettes that highlighted relatively positive or negative facts about the nation’s
performance in the fight against COVID-19. Democrats and Republicans alike revised their

1

beliefs in the direction of the evidence, and by about the same amount. However, when
asked how responsible Trump was for the U.S. response, Democrats and Republicans used
the same information to make opposite inferences about presidential responsibility. Republicans who saw positively valenced information were more likely to say President Trump is
responsible, and less likely to say he is responsible when they saw negatively valenced information. Democrats responded in the opposite way, holding Trump more responsible when
they saw negatively valenced information and less responsible when they saw positively valenced information. This demonstrates that near-identical changes in perception produce
opposite inferences about incumbent responsibility.
After confirming that individual-level factors contribute to selective attribution, we
investigate the particular mechanism behind this pattern. Previously published accounts
overwhelmingly take selective attribution as face-value evidence of partisan-motivated reasoning (see Table 2, column 7). According to the motivated reasoning account, selective
attribution occurs because voters’ partisan identities create a psychological motivation to
avoid blaming their party. We find little support for this explanation. In particular, we
fail to confirm a basic descriptive prediction of this account: voters with stronger partisan identities have greater motivation to selectively attribute responsibility, which implies
that as voters’ partisan identities become stronger, partisan differences in attributions of
responsibility should increase.
As an alternative, we develop an explanation rooted in performance beliefs, which we
define as voters’ perceptions of whether the incumbent is likely to deliver good performance.
This explanation is floated briefly in one existing account of selective attribution (Sirin and
Villalobos 2011) and is rooted in classic work on democratic accountability (Key 1966a). We
extend these accounts by using Bayes’ rule to derive a performance-based explanation for
selective attribution. A voter who believes that the incumbent is competent (i.e. likely to
deliver good performance) will respond to positive news by attributing more responsibility
to the incumbent, and negative news by attributing less responsibility to the incumbent.

2

A voter who believes the incumbent is incompetent will assign responsibility and evaluate
performance in the opposite way. Of course, partisan identity can shape performance beliefs
through any number of processes that may be characterized as motivational bias. What
distinguishes this account from partisan motivated reasoning is that fixing someone’s performance beliefs, partisanship does not need to actively skew reasoning for selective attribution
to emerge. Bayesian reasoners who differ in their performance beliefs should also diverge in
their attributions of responsibility, even in the absence of partisan motivation.
We test the formally derived predictions of the performance-based account in three
ways. First, in an experiment, we test and confirm a novel prediction of the Bayesian
account. We find that identical information about presidential responsibility causes partisans
to make opposite inferences about the performance of a federal agency, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Second, we conduct a regression-based horse race
using a novel measure of performance beliefs and state-of-the-art measures of partisan social
identity (Greene 1999; Huddy et al. 2015). We find that performance beliefs are the better
predictor of how voters use information in their attributions of responsibility. Third, we
reinterpret some existing findings that cannot easily be explained by partisan-motivated
reasoning: Rudolph’s (2003b) finding that Republican voters did not selectively attribute
responsibility with respect to former Democratic President Bill Clinton’s economic record,
and Bisgaard’s (2019) twice-replicated finding of selective attribution among voters who share
an ideological alignment, but not a partisan identification, with the governing coalition in
Denmark.
We summarize our main findings and their implications in Table 1. These findings
contribute in several ways to research in this area. First, few other studies of selective
attribution—and none focused on crises or disasters—leverage temporal variation in realworld conditions or randomly assigned performance information. We do both for a once-ina-century public health crisis, documenting how perceptions, behaviors, and attributions of
responsibility evolved in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Second, we highlight an observational equivalence problem. Whereas most existing accounts interpret partisan divergences in attributions of responsibility as face-value evidence
of partisan-motivated reasoning (Table 2), we show that the performance-based explanation
deserves a seat at the table. In highlighting the difficulty of distinguishing identity-motivated
reasoning from cold, accuracy-motivated cognition, we join recent scholarship on the politics
of climate change (Druckman and McGrath 2019) and racialized police violence (Jefferson
et al. 2020), as well as a long tradition among social psychologists of carefully considering
non-motivational explanations for patterns that appear at face value to be textbook examples of motivated reasoning (Miller and Ross 1975; Kunda 1990). Relatively speaking, the
performance-based account is more optimistic with respect to humans’ capacity as reasoners
and thinkers, providing hope that individuals with group identities could at least be capable
of reaching objective conclusions.
Third, our explanation for partisan selectivity builds a new bridge between competing accounts of partisanship. A classic debate contests whether partisanship is a “running
tally” of performance evaluations (Fiorina 1978, 1981) or a “perceptual screen” rooted in
social identity (Campbell et al. 1960). Our performance-based explanation highlights a link
between these accounts: a running tally of performance perceptions should be expected to
produce patterns of selective attribution that existing research takes as face-value evidence
of a perceptual screen. This suggests that selective attributions of responsibility may emerge
in part as an unwelcome side effect of political parties’ ability to develop reputations for
delivering good performance, which in isolation is viewed as a net positive for democratic
functioning (Rosenbluth and Shapiro 2018). In this way, determining what portion of selective attribution is due to performance beliefs and what portion is due to partisan identity
is essential to understanding the nature of selective attribution and its implications for the
study of politics.

Perceptions, Attributions, and Accountability
A potential advantage of democratic political systems is that elections may select competent politicians and provide incentives for politicians to deliver better performance (Fearon
1999; Ferejohn 1986; Manin 1997). A base-level question for such accounts is whether voters
perceive government performance at all, given voters’ limited exposure to political information and limited incentives to gather it (Downs 1957). Voters are thought to form impressions
of performance not through a detailed analysis of public policies and their effects, but by
paying attention to their own pocketbook (Fiorina 1981), their local context (Snowberg et al.
2011), or the news (Kayser and Leininger 2015). This leaves elections to exert a rough sort
of justice in which information-poor, “myopic” voters appear to react mostly to conditions
immediately before the election (Healy and Lenz 2014).
To the extent that voters perceive the political world at all, another concern is that
partisan voters perceive it differently. Ideally, one might hope Democrats and Republicans
shared a common set of factual basis for their debates, disagreeing only over matters of
policy (Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996). In practice, voters appear to know more about facts
that are convenient to their preferred political party (Bartels 2002). Despite this, Democrats
and Republicans also respond to changing economic conditions by updating their beliefs in
the direction of the evidence (Bisgaard 2015; Gerber and Green 1999; Parker-Stephen 2013).
Existing analyses of large question banks put the typical partisan belief difference at 5 to 15
percentage points, suggesting plenty of room for objectivity (Jerit and Barabas 2012; Roush
and Sood 2020).
To whatever extent perceptions are objective, objectivity may not be enough. Whereas
early research on performance-based accountability largely looked past the steps between
performance perceptions and vote choice (Downs 1957; Key 1966a), subsequent scholarship
argued that attributions of responsibility are crucial to how voters convert perceptions of the
world into political attitudes and preferences. Perceptions of social and economic conditions
only predict candidate preference among those who hold the government responsible for social
6

conditions (Rudolph and Grant 2002) or for events in their personal lives (Feldman 1982;
Peffley and Williams 1985). For example, Republican success in the 1982 midterm elections
has been credited to the American electorate’s refusal to blame President Ronald Reagan
for the preceding recession (Petrocik and Steeper 1986). These patterns raise the stakes
for the process of attributing responsibility. If the incumbent’s out-partisans react to good
news by reasoning that the incumbent must not have been responsible for it, they should
be correspondingly less likely to reward the incumbent at the ballot box. Similarly, if the
president’s co-partisans react to bad news by inferring that the president is not responsible
for it, they may remain loyal even in the face of mismanagement.
A growing body of scholarship finds that voters attribute responsibility in just such a
selective manner, disproportionately crediting their party for positive outcomes and blaming the other party for negative outcomes. This means that even when partisans agree on
the facts, they may diverge in their evaluations of the incumbent because they attribute
responsibility for outcomes differently. Existing evidence of this pattern draws upon several
distinct sources of variation (Table 2). Observationally, oppositely-signed cross-sectional relationships between evaluations and attributions of responsibility have been detected among
supporters and opponents of the governing party when it comes to national economic conditions (Marsh and Tilley 2009; Nawara 2015; c.f. Rudolph 2003b), state-level fiscal conditions
(Brown 2010; Rudolph 2003a), and personal experiences with the health care system (McCabe 2016).1 In the only previously published study that leverages temporal variation,
Bisgaard (2015) shows that even as Britons almost universally recognized worsening economic conditions during the Great Recession, supporters and opponents of the governing
Labour party polarized in their attributions of political responsibility for the state of the
economy.

1
The pattern is also evident when European Union (EU) citizens attribute responsibility between their
national government and the EU government for a range of social conditions (Hobolt and Tilley 2014).

Cites “group-serving attributional bias” but does not specify a mechanism for it (196). † Concludes that selective attribution is evidence of “partisan
filters” (134). Partisan filters are described as opposed to performance-based accounts (119), but mechanisms for partisan filtering are not discussed.

Stronger evidence that perceptions themselves influence attributions of responsibility
emerges in experiments that randomly assign positively or negatively valenced information
about economic conditions. In the U.S. and Denmark, partisans responded to new information by updating their factual beliefs in the same direction but attributed blame or credit to
the incumbent selectively (Bisgaard 2019). In-partisans were more likely to hold the incumbent responsible when they read positively framed information, and less responsible when
they read negatively framed information. Out-partisans did the opposite.2 Bisgaard’s experiments suggest that selective attribution occurs at least in part through some individual-level
process that is triggered by exposure to information that may be relevant to the incumbent’s
performance. A related set of experiments finds that randomly assigning partisan labels to
government officials causes Democrats and Republicans to diverge in their attributions of
responsibility for Hurricane Katrina (Malhotra and Kuo 2008), the September 11 attacks
(Healy et al. 2014), and hypothetical state-level fiscal conditions (Rudolph 2006).
Among accounts that explain these patterns in terms of any particular individual-level
explanation, all but one focuses upon partisan-motivated reasoning. These accounts posit
that reasoners are driven by one of two classes of motivations, accuracy and directional.
Directional motivations emerge from a psychological need to maintain a positive image of
oneself or one’s social group (Kunda 1990). Identities like partisanship are a source of
directional motivation, absent which agents are presumed to reason with accuracy as the goal
(Leeper and Slothuus 2014). As Kahan (2016) puts it, “[the] goal of ‘politically motivated
reasoning’ is identity protection: the formation of beliefs that maintain a person’s status in
[an] affinity group” (4, emphasis original).
In its home field of social psychology, scholarship on motivated reasoning is characterized by a long tradition of scrutinizing the difference between motivational explanations for
self- and group-serving biases and “cognitive” explanations (Miller and Ross 1975; Kunda
1990) that do not require any motive other than the formation of accurate beliefs. In contrast,

Hobolt et al. (2013) find a similar pattern with respect to British voters’ attributions between their
national government and the EU government.

only one previously published article notes any other explanation for selective attribution
(Sirin and Villalobos 2011), and none tests two explanations against one another. In the
next section, we elaborate our performance-based explanation for selective attribution, an
alternative to partisan-motivated reasoning with deep roots in both the literature on democratic accountability and in the aforementioned psychological work on self- and group-serving
attributions.

A Bayesian Account of Selective Attribution
Classic accounts of democratic accountability note that voters overwhelmingly view
their preferred candidate as more able to deliver good performance (Key 1966a; Sigelman
and Knight 1985). In this section, we examine how Bayes’ rule predicts that a voter with
performance beliefs of this kind would use them to make inferences about responsibility for
events and social conditions. Though we do not have any expectation that voters actually
follow Bayes’ rule, its roots in the laws of probability make it a convenient model of how one
might reason absent any directional motivation (e.g., Gerber and Green 1999; Little 2019).
In this section, we present a brief exposition of our analytic results. The appendix provides
more detailed proofs.
We begin by mathematically expressing the phenomenon of interest: that the state of
the world appears to affect voters’ perceptions of the government’s responsibility for creating
those conditions. To do so, we consider the probabilistic beliefs of a representative voter in
each of two possible two states of the world, good (G) and bad (¬G). Let R = 1 indicate
that the incumbent is responsible and R = 0 indicate the opposite. According to Bayes’
rule, the voter’s belief that the incumbent is responsible, P (R = 1|·), should equal

P (R = 1|G) =

P (G|R = 1) · P (R = 1)
P (G|R = 1) · P (R = 1) + P (G|R = 0) · P (R = 0)

10

(1)

in the good state of the world, and

P (R = 1|¬G) =

P (¬G|R = 1) · P (R = 1)
P (¬G|R = 1) · P (R = 1) + P (¬G|R = 0) · P (R = 0)

(2)

in the bad state of the world. Subtracting (2) from (1) expresses a key result from the
selective attribution literature: voters’ attributions of responsibility depend on how well
they think things are going.3 Substituting and rearranging terms yields our key analytic
result,

P (R = 1|G) − P (R = 1|¬G) ∝ P (G|R = 1) − P (G|R = 0).

(3)

The left-hand side is simply the difference between (2) and (1), implying that voters’ attributions of responsibility depend on how well things are going. The right-hand side indicates
that any such tendency should emerge in proportion to the voter’s beliefs about the incumbent’s ability to deliver good performance. To see this, consider that the first term,
P (G|R = 1), is the probability of good performance when the incumbent is responsible;
the second term, P (G|R = 0), is this probability when the incumbent is not responsible.
The difference between these two terms is the voter’s belief about the incumbent’s effect on
performance. The proportionality symbol, ∝, indicates that the two sides are equal up to a
constant factor. This means that a Bayesian agent’s performance beliefs and attributions of
responsibility always take the same sign and covary steadily as functions of one another.
To grasp the key implication of equation (3), consider a Bayesian voter who believes
good outcomes are likely under the incumbent (i.e., P (G|R = 1) − P (G|R = 0) > 0).
When such a voter observes good outcomes, that voter will think it is more likely that the
incumbent is responsible for performance in that area (i.e., P (R = 1|G)−P (R = 1|¬G) > 0).
In contrast, for a Bayesian voter who believes that good outcomes are unlikely under the
3

More specifically, subtracting (2) from (1) expresses the relationship between attributions of responsibility and the state of the world using potential outcomes notation, where G is the treatment variable and
R is the outcome variable (Rubin 1974).

11

incumbent, the right-hand side takes the opposite sign (i.e., P (G|R = 1) − P (G|R = 0) <
0). When such a voter observes good outcomes, they should be less likely to attribute
responsibility to the incumbent (i.e., P (R = 1|G) − P (R = 1|¬G) < 0).
We show in the appendix that this same principle holds for population averages, implying that

µR|G − µR|¬G ∝ µG|R=1 − µG|R=0 .

(4)

This means that when two groups of people have oppositely-signed beliefs about the incumbent’s effect on performance (right side), they should respond to the same changes in the
state of the world by making opposite inferences about whether the incumbent is responsible
for performance (left side).
Existing research establishes that in many cases, the left-hand side of expression (4)
takes opposite signs for Democrats and Republicans.4 We have shown that Bayes’ rule
implies that the right-hand side, which is aptly described as a performance belief, should
take the same sign as the left-hand side, which expresses selective attribution. This implies
that selective attribution can emerge as a function of differences in performance beliefs,
which are documented in classic work on democratic accountability (Key 1966a; Sigelman
and Knight 1985).

Time Series Evidence
We begin our empirical analysis by examining original time series data collected during
the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. To measure the American
public’s reactions to the growing crisis, we partnered with Lucid to field a time series crosssectional survey, recruiting about 600 respondents each Sunday from March 8 to April 12,
2020 (six weeks; total N = 3, 748). The time series data span a critical period in the

That is, most of the studies in Table 2 suggest in one way or another that when the state of the world
becomes better or worse, partisans make opposite inferences about whether the incumbent is responsible.

pandemic. On the date of the first survey, the United States recorded its 500th confirmed
COVID-19 case. Only one state, Washington, had confirmed a COVID-19 death. By the
end of the time series, the nation had confirmed more than 500,000 cases and 23,000 deaths.
The pandemic’s dramatic escalation during this period produced a pattern that is
convenient to our object of study: close-to-parallel changes in perceptions among Democrats
and Republicans. Although the subsequent politicization of the pandemic is a more common
object of study, data collected in March and early to mid-April consistently suggest that
Democrats’ and Republicans’ shared recognition of the growing threat dwarfed partisan
divides. Gollust, Nagler and Fowler (2020) note that “[i]n mid-April, there was a strong
bipartisan consensus on the threat and support for shelter-in-place recommendations” that
soon broke down (973). Similarly, Sides, Tausanovitch and Vavreck (2020) describe an early
“consensus” that “broke down ... largely along partisan lines” (4-5).5 To provide more
specific verification that the patterns we document are consistent with existing research,
Appendix B.3 analyzes replication data from previously published articles on partisanship
and the pandemic (Allcott et al. 2020; Clinton et al. 2021).
Our most objective measure of factual beliefs about the outbreak is the respondent’s
best guess of the cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths recorded nationwide and
in the respondent’s own state. Figure 2a displays a box and whisker plot of the distribution
of Democrats’ and Republicans’ best guesses. Each week, Democrats and Republicans made
similar guesses about the number of cases and deaths.6 The survey also asked respondents
to assess the threat from COVID-19 on a scale five-point Likert scale from “no threat”
to “imminent” (Figure 2b). On this measure, a partisan gap of about 0.5 scale points
consistently appears each week, equal to about 13 percent of the 1 to 5 scale. Despite
5

The existence of greater agreement earlier in the crisis is consistent with findings that anxiety-inducing
threats boost effortful information processing and reduce reliance on political heuristics (Brader 2005; Huddy
et al. 2007). For example, an experiment conducted March 20-23, 2020 found that partisan endorsements
had no effect on COVID-related attitudes or behaviors (Gadarian, Goodman and Pepinsky 2020).
6
Consistent with best practices (Ansolabehere et al. 2013), respondents were told the total population of
the nation and state before they made their guess (y-axis, Figure 2a). Using a less obtrusive version of the
technology described by Diedenhofen and Musch (2017) and Permut et al. (2019), we flagged respondents
as suspected of looking up the answers and dropped them from our analysis of these items only.

this persistent gap, Democrats and Republicans also updated their perceptions by a similar
amount—close to a full scale point in each party. Further parallelislm appears in a battery of
self-reported behavioral changes (Figure 2c). On each of several indicators including avoiding
physical contact with others, isolating oneself for at least 24 hours, and purchasing masks
or other protective gear, Democrats and Republicans changed their behavior by about the
same amount at approximately the same time.
In contrast to Democrats’ and Republicans’ parallel updating in threat perceptions,
the time series documents substantial partisan divergence in attributions of responsibility
for the pandemic. Each respondent rated several actors’ blameworthiness for the pandemic
on a four-point Likert scale ranging from “not at all” to “a lot.” From March 8 to April
12, the average rating among Democrats increased by about 0.79 scale points, which is 23.5
percent of the scale (s.e. = 3.2), compared with 0.26 scale points or 8.9 percent of the scale
for Republicans (s.e. = 2.8; difference = 16.1, s.e. = 4.4). A more muted version of the same
pattern appears in attributions of blame to Trump’s party, the Republicans (difference =
15.3, s.e. = 4.2). By contrast, little such divergence is seen in the extent to which partisans
blame Democrats, U.S. government agencies, immigrants, bad luck, or nature. A slight

degree of divergence is seen in attributions of blame to China, Trump’s preferred scapegoat.
In the appendix, we use regression to summarize these patterns more precisely.
Even as these data establish that patterns of selective attribution appeared in the real
world, time series data also have important downsides when it comes to testing explanations
for this pattern. In particular, other time-varying confounders may distort the observed
relationship. For example, we observe voters attributing more blame to the government
in general during this period. Democrats assigned more blame to Democrats, Republicans
assigned more blame to Republicans, and both groups assigned more blame to government
agencies in general. This is consistent with existing research that documents selective attribution alongside sensible patterns like blaming the appropriate level of government (e.g., for
disaster responses [Malhotra and Kuo 2008] and fiscal conditions [Rudolph 2003a]), as well
as a large, contemporaneous increase in the average pandemic-related news article’s degree
of focus on politicians and government (Hart et al. 2020). These factors complicate our
ability to test the Bayesian framework’s prediction that a change in the state of the world
should cause groups with oppositely-signed performance beliefs to adjust their attributions
of responsibility in opposite directions.
A more severe threat to inference is that time-varying factors at the elite level could also
cause voters to diverge in their attributions of responsibility. In our minds, the most likely
such confounding factor is opinion leaders’ tendency to take credit for positive developments
and deflect blame for negative ones. Though contemporaneous reports indicate that Trump’s
then-famous pivot from taking credit to deflecting blame occurred after our surveys ended,7
it is possible that some of the partisan divergence we document occurred in response to
elite rhetoric rather than individual-level factors. To better-isolate the relationship between
individual perception and selective attribution, we turn to experiments.
7

A quintet of New York Times reporters dates the Trump administration’s pivot from taking credit for
the pandemic response to disowning it to “a critical period in mid-April” that began “soon after” April 11,
2020 (Shear et al. 2020). Moreover, Bisbee and Lee (2020) show that when our survey began, Trump was
using Twitter to encourage taking the pandemic seriously about as often as he was downplaying it; he was
silent on COVID risks in the last week of our survey (Bisbee and Lee 2020, Figure 2), with his then-famous
call to liberate Michigan coming on April 15.

16

Experimental Evidence
Although partisan selectivity in attributions of responsibility has been documented in
a range of contexts (Table 2), scholars have only begun to examine the mechanism through
which this occurs. To shed light on these mechanisms, we conducted survey experiments
designed to answer two questions. First, does partisan selectivity in blame attribution occur
because voters use the same performance information to make opposite inferences about
responsibility? Only one existing study tests this mechanism (Bisgaard 2019). Second, how
well do the individual-level factors emphasized by the motivated reasoning and performance
belief explanations predict variation in the tendency to attribute blame selectively? No
existing research examines an alternative to the former explanation (Table 2). We examine
the first question as we introduce each experiment and the second question after all three
experiments have been introduced.
Experiment 1: The Causal Effect of Performance Information
The first experiment examines the causal effect of performance beliefs on attributions of
responsibility. In May 2020, we recruited 1,059 respondents using Amazon Mechanical Turk
(MTurk), which provides diverse national samples that skew young. Our sample included
564 Democrats or independents who lean toward the Democrats (“Democrat leaners”), 360
Republicans and Republican leaners, and 134 independents who do not lean toward either
party.
The experiment examined the causal effect of information about the severity of the
pandemic on two outcomes: (a) perceptions of how well the United States is doing in the
fight against COVID-19, and (b) attributions of responsibility to President Trump. Each
participant read four short vignettes providing information on the number of COVID-19
cases, number of deaths, testing capacity, and progress in developing treatments. Within
these fixed topic areas, half of the respondents were randomly assigned to read positively
valenced information, while the other half saw negatively valenced information. The in-

Note: The figure reports the group means for Democrats (blue diamonds) and Republicans (red squares)

formation made no reference to the government or to any political figure. Following this,
respondents answered three questions: an open-ended question about who is responsible for
handling of the pandemic, a closed-ended question about how responsible Trump is for the
pandemic, and a closed-ended question about how well the U.S. is handling the pandemic.
This experiment successfully manipulated perceptions of the pandemic, among both
Democrats and Republicans (Figure 3, left). On average, Republicans who read negatively
valenced information rated the nation’s performance as “neither good nor bad,” while Republicans who read positively valenced information rated US performance as “fairly good.”

The difference, about 16 percent of the scale, was statistically significant (CATE

and Democrats is statistically insignificant (CATERd
− CATED = -0.010, s.e. = 0.038). In
appendix C, we find that the treatment moved perceptions of performance on each of the
four dimensions, for both Democrats and Republicans (see Figure C.1).

18

Despite these parallel changes in perceptions, Democrats and Republicans made opposite inferences about the implications for presidential responsibility (Figure 3, right). Compared with Republicans who read negatively valenced performance information, those who
read positively valenced information said Trump was more responsible for the nation’s perd R = 0.060, s.e. = 0.026). For Democrats, the pattern was reversed. Comformance (CATE

valenced information said Trump was less responsible (CATE
The difference in treatment effects is approximately 13 percent of the width of the scale
(CATERd
− CATED = 0.130, s.e. = 0.035).
Immediately before this close-ended question, we asked respondents an open-ended
question about who is responsible for the pandemic. The question did not mention Trump
or any other political figure. We coded responses as “1” if the respondent said Trump was
responsible, else “0”. We coded all responses using an automated dictionary-based approach
and a research assistant who was blind to the hypotheses and the computer’s coding. This
procedure yielded a 97.9 percent inter-coder agreement. A second research assistant, also
blind to the hypotheses and the other codings, independently broke all ties.
The open-ended outcome yields a similar pattern. The difference-in-means is positive
d R = 0.008, s.e. = 0.043) and negative for Democrats (CATE
dD =for Republicans (CATE
0.095, s.e. = 0.041), resulting in a borderline-statistically significant difference (CATERd
− CATED
= 0.103, s.e. = 0.059, p = 0.08). In effect, partisan differences appear to exist even when
questions of accountability are not explicitly stated in political terms.
In terms of the Bayesian framework given above, these results show that for Democrats
and Republicans, µR|G − µR|¬G takes opposite signs. Republicans react to good news by
attributing more responsibility to Trump, while Democrats react to the same news by attributing less. The partisan motivated reasoning explanation predicts the same pattern, but
attributes it to group identity.

19

Experiment 2: Testing a Novel Prediction
In the Bayesian account, voters respond to the same information by attributing responsibility differently because they have different beliefs about who can deliver good performance. We looked for evidence of such beliefs by conducting a second experiment that
estimates the quantity on the right-hand side of (4), µG|R=1 − µG|R=0 . If randomly-assigned
information about responsibility (R = 1 versus R = 0) does not induce Democrats and
Republicans to make opposite inferences about performance, our Bayesian result is unlikely
to hold the key to understanding selective attribution.
For this study, we recruited another diverse sample on MTurk (n = 1099) in May 2020.
Each participant read three short vignettes about how much control the president has over
the CDC’s budget, personnel, and the degree to which the CDC collaborated with the White
House on pandemic-related guidance. Within these topic areas, the experiment introduced
exogenous variation in presidential control, and through it perceptions of responsibility for
the CDC. Half of the respondents were randomly assigned to see information that emphasized
presidential control, while the other half saw information that minimized it. Following the
treatment, respondents answered two closed-ended questions, one on how much Trump was
responsible for the CDC’s performance and another on the CDC’s performance fighting the
COVID-19 pandemic.
The experiment successfully manipulated perceptions of presidential responsibility for
the CDC’s performance, among both Republicans and Democrats (Figure 4, left). Compared
with Republicans who read information that understated presidential control, Republicans
who read information that emphasized presidential control thought Trump was more red R = 0.201, s.e. = 0.028). Democrats responded
sponsible for the CDC’s performance (CATE
d D = 0.231, s.e. = 0.024). In both cases, the treatment
similarly to the treatment (CATE
effect was equal to about 20 percent of the scale. The difference in conditional average
treatment effects is statistically insignificant (CATERd
− CATED = -0.0299, s.e. = 0.0364).
In appendix D, we show that the treatment moved perceptions of presidential responsibility

on each of the three dimensions, for both Democrats and Republicans (see Figure D.1).
Even as Democrats and Republicans made the same inference about presidential control
over the CDC, they made opposite inferences about the agency’s performance. Compared
with Republicans who read facts that minimized presidential control over the CDC, those
d R = 0.0525, s.e. =

when presidential control was low and worse when presidential control was high (CATE

significant (CATERd
− CATED = 0.1524, s.e. = 0.0334).
Combined with our first experiment, these results provide further evidence of the
performance-based account’s plausibility. Democrats and Republicans use performance information to make inferences about responsibility (Experiment 1, left-hand side of (3)) and
responsibility information to make opposite inferences about performance (Experiment 2,
right-hand side of (3)). Though existing accounts do not predict the latter result, we suspect
that a rationale for identity-protective inferences about the performance of federal agencies
could be developed ex post. Accordingly, we interpret this result mainly as an encouraging

21

sign for the Bayesian account’s ability to generate testable, accurate predictions.
Experiment 3: Pre-Election Replication
The third experiment is a pre-registered replication of the first experiment in a more
politicized context: eight months into the pandemic, three weeks after the president caught
COVID-19, and one week before the presidential election. Between October 23 and 25,
2020, we used MTurk to recruit a diverse national sample (n = 3, 592) for a baseline survey
that collected the respondent’s demographics, partisan identity, beliefs about presidential
performance, and pre-treatment measures of the outcomes. On October 26-28, six to eight
days before the election, we invited the 3,234 partisans and independent leaners to complete
a follow-up survey containing only the experiment and the outcomes.8 Of these, 2,504
respondents completed the second experiment.9
The design here was very similar to experiment 1. Each respondent was randomly
assigned to read a set of positively or negatively framed vignettes, focusing on the most recent
information on four topic areas: the number of COVID-19 cases, number of deaths, testing
capacity, and progress in developing vaccines and treatments. Following this, respondents
answered two close-ended questions: one on how responsible Trump is for handling of the
pandemic, another on how well the U.S. is handling the pandemic. At no point prior to
measuring outcomes did the survey mention any political party or figure.10
Once again, the experiment successfully manipulated perceptions about the pandemic,
among Democrats and Republicans (Figure 5, left). In fact, the point estimates in this sample
are almost identical to those in experiment 1. On average, Republicans who viewed negatively
valenced information rated US’ performance as neither good nor bad, while those that read
d R = 0.175, s.e. = 0.013).
positively valenced information rated it as fairly good (CATE

Methodological research suggests that the proximity of our pre- and post-treatment measures of the
outcome is unlikely to have biased our estimates (Clifford et al. 2020).

A pre-analysis plan for the experiment is publicly available at [AUTHOR IDENTIFYING LINK REMOVED]. For budgetary reasons, we pre-registered that we would end the study once we reached 2,500
respondents in the second wave.

We updated the treatments from experiment 1 to include any new information on COVID-19 cases,
deaths, testing, and vaccine development. We used exactly the same close-ended questions.

that the treatment moved perceptions of U.S. performance on all four dimensions, for both
Democrats and Republicans (see Figure E.1).
As before, Democrats and Republicans also used the information to make opposite
inferences about political responsibility for the pandemic. Republicans who saw positively
valenced information attributed more responsibility to President Trump, compared with
d R = 0.099, s.e. = 0.014). By

23

Group Identity and Selective Attribution
Causal mechanisms are hard to pinpoint (Bullock, Green and Ha 2010). As suggestive
evidence as to which of two mechanisms is more likely to explain a phenomenon, researchers
often examine how well various individual-level traits predict variation in the effect of an
experimental treatment. Because directionally motivated reasoning is identity-protective,
researchers expect the tendency toward motivated reasoning to be strongest among those
with the strongest identities (e.g., Nyhan and Reifler 2010; Leeper and Slothuus 2014). In our
context, stronger identification with a party should correspond to a greater their tendency
to attribute responsibility selectively.
To test this prediction, Figure 6 separates the treatment effects from our experiment
into three groups: respondents who think of themselves as strong partisans, respondents
who think of themselves as partisans but not strongly so (henceforth, weak partisans), and
respondents who do not think of themselves as partisans but lean toward one party or
the other (henceforth, independent leaners or leaners).11 The top row of Figure 6 displays
treatment effect estimates for the “upstream” outcome that each experiment was designed
to manipulate—performance evaluations in experiments 1 and 3, and Trump’s responsibility
for the CDC in experiment 2. On average, every subgroup responded to the treatments by
updating their beliefs in the same direction.
The relationship between partisan identity and selective attribution is displayed in the
middle and bottom rows of Figure 6. The middle row displays treatment effect estimates
for the “downstream” outcome—Trump’s responsibility for the US’ performance in experiments 1 and 3, and the CDC’s performance in experiment 2. The bottom row represents
the difference in treatment effects between Republicans and Democrats for each sub-group.
If stronger group identity predicts greater selectivity in attributions of responsibility, this
should manifest as a growing divergence between the treatment effect for Democrats (blue
11
In light of the common posture that leaners can simply be thought of as “closet partisans,” we show below
that the standard scale’s identity-focused wording succeeds in identifying respondents who differ according
to more recently-developed measures of partisan identity (Table 3; Greene 1999; Huddy et al. 2015).

diamonds) and Republicans (red squares). As an alternative visualization, the bottom row
plots the difference between the conditional average treatment estimates directly above. A
positively-sloped trend line would corroborate the motivated reasoning explanation.
The results fail to do so. In Experiments 1 and 2, we find a non-monotonic relationship:
based on the point estimates, weak partisans appear to attribute responsibility less selectively
than independents leaning toward a party. We pre-registered a test for this pattern in
Experiment 3. We instead find a flat relationship, with no meaningful differences between
strong partisans, weak partisans, and independents who lean toward a party (for a statistical
test see Appendix Table F.2, column 3). Though we would certainly not claim that these
results rule out any role for group identity, they are also far from the slam-dunk evidence
that one might expect to find in support of a consensus explanation from existing research.
Partisan Identity versus Performance Beliefs: A Horse Race
For a more direct test of the relative explanatory power of the identity- and performancebased accounts, Experiment 3 also included a “horse race” that puts the two explanations
in direct competition with one another. This section closely follows the empirical strategy
in existing research that argues in favor of partisan identity’s explanatory power (Huddy,
Mason and Aaroe 2015).
Our measure of partisan identity is adapted from Greene (1999) and Huddy et al.
(2015). All respondents who indicated a partisan preference were asked to rate three statements, each using five-point Likert scale ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.”
The scale meets conventional standards for internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.86). We
take a simple average of the three measures, then construct a scale where 0 indicates strong
identification as a Democrat, 1 strong identification as a Republican, and 0.5 no identification with either party (i.e., strong disagreement with all three statements). We refer to this
as the partisan social identity scale, or the social identity scale for short.
To measure performance beliefs, we developed a three-item scale based on the measures
analyzed in Key (1966a) and our Bayesian framework.

• When President Trump is running the government, do you expect government performance to get better or worse? (Definitely worse, probably worse, makes no difference,
probably better, definitely better)
• What effect would you say President Trump has on the government’s ability to solve
problems? (Completely negative, mostly negative, neither negative nor positive, mostly
positive, completely positive)
• Who would you say is more competent: Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden
or Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump? (Definitely Trump, probably
Trump, equally competent, probably Biden, definitely Biden)
All three statements are designed to capture variation in the right-hand side of equation 3,
i.e., the difference in the probability of good performance when Trump is and is not responsible for that performance. The scale meets conventional standards for internal consistency
(Cronbach’s α = 0.92).
To provide a sense of how these measures relate to the analysis above, Table 3 displays
the mean of each, conditional on the respondent’s classification using the traditional sevenpoint party identification scale. The left pair of columns displays the conditional mean of
the partisan social identity scale. Partisan social identity varies monotonically as a function
of the traditional scale, as one might expect given the identity-focused wording used in both
measures. Weak partisans and leaners are substantantially different from one another, problematizing the notion that the groups’ similar tendencies toward selective attribution are
simply a function of “closet” partisanship (Keith et al. 1992). The right pair of columns displays the conditional mean of the performance belief scale. In contrast to the neat alignment
between the two identity-focused measures, performance beliefs are non-monotonic in the
traditional scale. Among respondents who prefer the Democratic party, independent leaners
view Trump’s performance most negatively. This difference is statistically indistinguishable
from what is observed among strong partisans. However, it is lower than what is observed
among weak partisans, who view Trump’s ability to deliver good performance more positively
than the other two groups. Among Republicans, leaners and weak partisans are statistically
indistinguishable from one another, while strong partisans view Trump’s performance more

positively than the other two groups. These patterns open the door for performance beliefs
to explain some of what partisan identity does not.
To test which of these measures is a better predictor of blame attribution, we preregistered a linear model,

Yi = α + β1 Identityi + β2 Performancei + β3 Zi + β4 (Zi × Identityi ) +
β5 (Zi × Performancei ) + β6 Xi + i ,

(5)

where Yi is the amount of responsibility attributed to Trump, Zi is an indicator of the
respondent’s treatment status in the experiment (0 = negatively valenced information, 1 =
positively valenced information), Identityi and Performancei are the scales just described,
and Xi is the baseline measure of Yi . In the model, α is the mean for a strong Democrat
who is certain that Trump delivers bad performance and is exposed to negatively valenced
information. For such a respondent, β3 is the predicted treatment effect of a switch to positive

information. The key parameters are β4 and β5 , which respectively capture how this effect
varies as a function of partisan identity and performance beliefs. Because our model includes
both variables, our OLS estimates of the parameters “partial out” the variation predicted
by the other variable, and describe the residual predictive power of each after controlling for
the other (Wooldridge 2012). Consequently, we interpret β5 (β4 ) as answering the following
question: after whatever variation in attributions of responsibility is predicted by partisan
identity (performance beliefs), what can still be predicted by performance beliefs (partisan
identity)?
We find that performance beliefs are the better predictor of variation in how our
respondents attributed responsibility. Table 4 presents OLS estimates of the parameters. In
specification (4), β5 tells us that compared with someone who thinks Trump never delivers
good performance, a person who thinks Trump always delivers good performance responds to

29

positively valenced information by attributing 0.22 more responsibility to Trump on the [0, 1]
scale. By comparison, β4 suggests partisan identity does not predict much heterogeneity in
treatment effects after accounting for performance beliefs. β4 is about one-fifth the size and
statistically insignificant. In the appendix, we show that the same patterns hold for both
Democrats and Republicans separately (Tables F.3 and F.4).
To contextualize this result, Table 4 presents the marginal treatment effect in specification (1), heterogeneity in treatment effects by partisanship in specification (2), and by
performance beliefs in specification (3). Separately, they both predict heterogeneity in treatment effects (β4 = 0.221, s.e. = 0.029 in column 2; β5 = 0.244, s.e. = 0.027 in column 3).
This indicates that partisan identity and performance beliefs are capable of predicting respondents’ tendency to respond differently to performance information. Performance beliefs
are the better predictor of selective attribution, but they are not the only predictor.
These results demonstrate that the key individual-level characteristic in the Bayesian
account, beliefs about the incumbent’s tendency to deliver good performance, deserves a
seat at the table as an explanation for partisan selectivity in attributions of responsibility.
Though the results do not rule out a role for partisan identity, they problematize the prevailing paradigm of viewing selective attribution as face-value evidence of an identity-based
mechanism.

Implications
Through the lens of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the findings in
this paper contributed to collective understanding of partisan selectivity in attributions of
responsibility in several respects. Empirically, our time series evidence is the first to chart
growing partisan selectivity in blame attributions as a national crisis unfolds, while our
experiments are the first to leverage exogenous variation in perceptions of such a crisis.12
As national crises unfold, partisans appear to diverge in their attributions of responsibility
12

Existing research on national crises like Hurricane Katrina and the September 11, 2001 attacks uses
randomly assigned party labels, not perceptions of the crisis. See Table 2.

30

automatically, as a function of individuals’ perceptions of the severity of the crisis.
Our account of this phenomenon can explain disconsonant results in existing research.
Using cross-sectional data from the 1998 ANES, Rudolph (2003b) finds that Democrats were
selective in their attributions of credit for economic performance under President Bill Clinton,
a Democrat. The more positively Democrats viewed the economy, the more likely they were
to say that the president is responsible for economic conditions. However, there was “no
evidence of partisan rationalizations among Republicans” (704). Instead, the estimates for
Republicans took the same sign as the estimates for Democrats in all three models and
even reached statistical significance in one case (Rudolph 2003b, Table 2). This cannot
be explained by partisan-motivated reasoning, but could be explained by Clinton’s strong
economic reputation among Republicans. In the same data, 67 percent of Republicans
approved of Clinton’s handling of the economy (against 29 percent disapproving) and 64
percent said the economy had gotten better during Clinton’s time in office (against 7 percent
saying it got worse). In light of this, the performance beliefs explanation predicts that
Republicans would react similarly to Democrats, who viewed Clinton’s economic record
even more favorably. The seemingly weaker13 relationship among Republicans could either
be explained by their weaker but still positive assessment of Clinton’s record or by crosspressure between group identity and performance beliefs.
Our account also helps explain otherwise-puzzling evidence from a context in which
some voters were cross-pressured between party and ideology. In an experiment conducted in
Denmark, Bisgaard (2019, study 2) finds that supporters of the center-left coalition government responded to positive (negative) information about performance by attributing more
(less) responsibility to the government. Supporters of rightist parties did the opposite. A
third group of cross-pressured voters—supporters of further-left parties excluded from the
governing coalition—attributed responsibility in the same way as supporters of the coalition
13

Technically speaking, there is little evidence that the relationship was weaker among Republicans than
among Democrats. The size of the differences between the coefficient estimates for Democrats and Republicans was comparable to the standard errors on each coefficient (see Rudolph 2003b, Table 2). This strongly
suggests that a direct test would not have found statistically significant evidence that the parties differed.

31

parties. Eighteen months later, after a center-right party (the Liberals) took control of the
government, a subsequent experiment found the same pattern in reverse (Bisgaard 2019,
study 3). The newly cross-pressured group, supporters of further-right parties that were
excluded from the government, once again privileged ideology over party by attributing responsibility in the same way as supporters of the governing coalition. The existence of such
effects among cross-pressured voters, as well as the general surprise that selective attribution
could emerge in a “low-polarization context” (831), indicates a need to consider alternative
explanations. Voters cannot be motivated to protect identities that they do not posses, but
could still believe that a government on their side of the ideological spectrum is more likely
to deliver good performance.
The explanatory power of our performance-based account changes the implications of
selective attribution for humans’ capacity as reasoners and thinkers. The partisan-motivated
reasoning explanation is rooted in the notion that group identities inherently skew reasoners’ conclusions. This suggests that so long as politically-relevant social groups exist, people
will be incapable of reasoning objectively. The performance-based explanation holds that
reasoners’ conclusions are skewed not by bias introduced by reasoning itself, but by prejudiced performance beliefs. Strong beliefs about party performance may be unjustified, and
may even have their roots in mechanisms emphasized in accounts of partisanship as a social
identity. Crucially, however, the performance-based explanation leaves hope that with more
objective beliefs, people who think of themselves as members of a group could still be capable of reasoning objectively. Even if the power of this explanation proves only to be partial,
identifying what portion it can explain is crucial to any effort to understand the selective
attribution phenomenon’s implications for politics.
The viability of our account sheds new light on the relationship between competing
accounts of political partisanship. Traditionally, the ideas that partisanship is a “perceptual
screen” (Campbell et al. 1960) and “running tally” of performance evaluations (Fiorina 1981)
have been treated as opposing possibilities. Our framework suggests a bridge between them:

32

a perceptual screen may be raised by the running tally itself. Voters who maintain such a tally
develop stronger beliefs about which party delivers better performance—particularly when
their tally begins during an event like the Great Depression, which had long-lasting effects
on Americans’ perceptions of the parties (Campbell et al. 1960).14 Our analytic results
suggest that such beliefs should be expected to affect how voters interpret performancerelevant information down the line. However, our results also suggest that such beliefs may
not translate cleanly into a partisan identity (Table 3). Rather than assume that similarities
between leaners and weak partisans indicate that leaners are concealing an identity (Keith
et al. 1992), researchers should consider alternative explanations for consistent partisan
preferences among individuals who do not think of themselves as partisans.
Our account also has implications for the role of parties in the democratic process. A
wide range of accounts of politics maintain that if voters hold parties responsible for their
actions in government, parties have an incentive to build a reputation for delivering policies and outcomes (Ranney 1954; Key 1966b; Sundquist 1988; Jones and McDermott 2004).
Necessarily, a party’s success in developing such a reputation implies the existence of performance beliefs among the voting public. Our account suggests that such reputations may be
a double-edged sword. Even as parties’ incentives to develop good reputations encourages
responsible governance (Manin 1997; Rosenbluth and Shapiro 2018), these same reputations
may have a self-reinforcing quality, locking in voters’ judgments in a way that stifles the
electorate’s ability to punish and reward parties for their subsequent performance. Whereas
opposite reactions to identical information look unambiguously bad in partial equilibrium,
partisan selectivity in attributions of responsibility may be an inconvenient side effect of
processes that are widely viewed as good in general equilibrium.
In conclusion, even as our findings add to the evidence that partisan selectivity in attributions of responsibility is a highly general pattern, our larger account demonstrates that
14

The outsized influence of initial frames is a more general phenomenon (Druckman et al. 2012). With
respect to performance beliefs, Peffley (1989) finds that voter perceptions of the president’s competence are
heavily conditioned by initial impressions of performance.

33

researchers have been too quick to attribute this pattern to a particular psychological bias,
partisan-motivated reasoning. We showed this by demonstrating that the laws of probability
imply a rarely recognized explanation rooted in performance beliefs, and that this explanation does a better job of predicting variation in how people attribute responsibility. This
opens the door to new perspectives on the nature and consequences of partisans’ tendency
to attribute blame in an apparently-selective manner.

A Proof Statement
Start with the estimand: P (R = 1|G) − P (R = 1|¬G).
Apply Bayes’ rule, and re-write it as:


P (G|R = 1) · P (R = 1)
P (G|R = 1) · P (R = 1) + P (G|R = 0) · P (R = 0)


P (¬G|R = 1) · P (R = 1)
−
P (¬G|R = 1) · P (R = 1) + P (¬G|R = 0) · P (R = 0)


Multiply through by the product of the denominators, which is equal to P (G)P (¬G)




P (R = 1|G) − P (R = 1|¬G) P (G)P (¬G) =


P (G|R = 1)P (R = 1) P (¬G|R = 1)P (R = 1) + P (¬G|R = 0)P (R = 0)


−P (¬G|R = 1)P (R = 1) P (G|R = 1)P (R = 1) + P (G|R = 0)P (R = 0)

Note that the right hand side can be rewritten as A(B + C) − B(A + D), which reduces to
AC − BD




P (R = 1|G) − P (R = 1|¬G) P (G)P (¬G) =

P (G|R = 1)P (R = 1)P (¬G|R = 0)P (R = 0) − P (¬G|R = 1)P (R = 1)P (G|R = 0)P (R = 0)
Divide through by P (R = 1)P (R = 0)

P (G)P (¬G)
=
P (R = 1)P (R = 0)
P (G|R = 1)P (¬G|R = 0) − P (¬G|R = 1)P (G|R = 0)


P (R = 1|G) − P (R = 1|¬G)

P (G)P (¬G)
Note that P (R=1)P
is always positive. Drop this term from the left side and be satisfied
(R=0)
that for any individual, the two sides are proportional

41




P (R = 1|G) − P (R = 1|¬G) ∝ P (G|R = 1)P (¬G|R = 0) − P (¬G|R = 1)P (G|R = 0)

Now on the right side, substitute P (¬G|R = ·) = 1 − P (G|R = ·)




P (R = 1|G) − P (R = 1|¬G) ∝ P (G|R = 1)[1 − P (G|R = 0)] − [1 − P (G|R = 1)]P (G|R = 0)

Solve on the right-hand side to get:




P (R = 1|G) − P (R = 1|¬G)

∝ P (G|R = 1) − [P (G|R = 1)P (G|R = 0)] − P (G|R = 0) + [P (G|R = 1)P (G|R = 0)]




P (R = 1|G) − P (R = 1|¬G) ∝ P (G|R = 1) − P (G|R = 0)

If we average over all individuals in a population, this relationship can be expressed as a
population quantity or estimand. Let there be k voters in the population, then the above
relationship can be expressed as:

Ek [E(R = 1|G)] − Ek [E(R = 1|¬G)] ∝ Ek [E(G|R = 1)] − Ek [E(G|R = 0)]

(6)

Where the expectation operator Ek [·] averages over k individuals, and E(·) is one individual’s
conditional expectation about presidential responsibility or performance. An equivalent way
to describe these population means is:

µR|G − µR|¬G ∝ µG|R=1 − µG|R=0

B Time Series
B.1 Survey information
Platform: Lucid.
Dates: March 8-April 12, 2020.
Screeners: Captcha verification.
Consent: Subjects read an IRB-approved consent form, then voluntarily consented to participate in a research study.
Refusal rate: 1.6 percent.
Compensation: $1 (waves 1-4 and 6) or $0.75 (wave 5), excluding a service fee of $0.25 per
respondent. These amounts were chosen to meet or exceed prevailing rates set by the vendor,
which typically charges $1 inclusive of all fees.
Sample size: 3,794 (total), 662 (wave 1), 633 (wave 2), 638 (wave 3), 625 (wave 4), 639 (wave
5), 597 (wave 6).

B.2 Regression analysis
The main text presents a graphical analysis of time series data (Figure 2). To statistically
test our claims, we specify a linear model of the time trends in all of these areas. We subset
our data to Democrats and Republicans only, then use ordinary least squares (OLS) to
estimate the parameters in
Yi = α + β1 (Wave-1)i + β2 Republicani + β3 (Wave-1)i × Republicani + i ,

(8)

where Yi is one of the variables appearing on the y-axis in the graphical analysis, α is the
average on March 8 among Democrats, β1 is the average weekly change among Democrats,
β2 is the difference between Democrats and Republicans on March 8, and β3 is the average
weekly change in the difference between Democrats and Republicans. The key parameters
are β2 and β3 . If partisans update in parallel, β3 should be close to 0. If partisans diverge, β2
and β3 should take the same sign. If partisans converge, β2 and β3 should take opposite signs.
We also estimate a version of this model that splits the estimate of β1 into five intercept
shifts, which relaxes the assumption of a linear time trend.
In the tables below, the parameter estimates are consistent with the hypothesis of parallel
updating. Of the the thirteen estimates of β3 in these categories, we can only detect a
statistical difference from zero in three cases (see Tables B.1, B.3, and B.5). In all three
of these—contact with others, hand-washing, and changing travel plan—the estimate takes
the opposite sign of β2 , indicating partisan convergence over time. This supports our claim
that over this period Democrats and Republicans updated their perceptions in the same
direction, usually by about the same magnitude, and occasionally in a way that narrowed
partisan perceptual differences.
In contrast to this, we find growing partisan divergence in attributions of political responsibility. Consistent with the graphical analysis (Figure 2), this divergence was most evident
in attributions of responsibility to President Trump. Each week, Democrats assigned 0.044
units more blame to Trump on a 0 to 1 scale, compared with 0.016 for Republicans. As a result, the partisan difference increased by 0.028 scale units each week (β3 = 0.028, s.e.= 0.007;
see Table B.7). A comparable divergence emerges while attributing blame to Republicans
(β3 = 0.026, s.e. = 0.007). The regression-based estimates also suggest partisan divergence
in blaming China, and of no divergence with respect to other entities or factors.

B.3 Benchmarking
Relative to existing research on partisanship’s relationship to responses to the pandemic, our
emphasis on parallel changes in perception between Democrats and Republicans is unusual.
This section shows that similar patterns are observed in two previously published studies
using data from this time period (Allcott et al. 2020; Clinton et al. 2021).

Note: This is a replication of Figure 3, Panel A in Allcott et al. (2020) for the time period March 8 to April
15, 2020. The x-axis plots the date, the y-axis plots the number of visits each week (normalized to one)
to SafeGraph’s places of interest (POIs). The data are separately plotted for Democratic counties (in blue)
and Republican counties (in red). Exactly following Allcott et al. (2020), Republican counties are “defined
to be those whose 2016 Republican vote share is greater than the median vote share (66.4 percent) across
the counties in [their] sample” (25).

Note: This is a replication of Figure 1A in Clinton et al. (2021) for the time period March 8 to April 13, 2020.
The x-axis plots the date, the y-axis plots “the weighted (to the adult U.S. population) daily [proportion]
of respondents who are “very” or “somewhat” worried about catching COVID-19”. The data are separately
plotted for Democrats (in blue) and Republicans (in red). The figure includes a LOESS fit (solid line) along
with a 95% confidence interval (gray shaded area).

Sample size: 1,059.
Screeners: Captcha verification.
Consent: Subjects read an IRB-approved consent form, then voluntarily consented to participate in a research study.
Refusal rate: 0 percent.
Compensation: $0.50. As the vendor does not set any standard rate, this amount was chosen
to exceed the hourly minimum wage in the United States.
No deception: As indicated in the approved IRB application, the experimental treatments
did not involve deception.

Note: This figure plots the average response among Democrats (in blue) and Republicans (in red) when
they read positively and negatively framed performance information. The point estimate is accompanied
by a 95% confidence interval constructed using heteroskedasticity-robust HC2 standard errors. We measure
performance beliefs, separately for each dimension, using the question: Would you say the U.S. is doing a
good job or a bad job of [controlling the spread of COVID-19/ limiting the number of deaths from COVID19/ testing for COVID-19/ improving the health care system’s ability to care for COVID-19 patients]? (Very
bad, fairly bad, neither good nor bad, fairly good, very good).

Note: This figure plots the average response among Democrats (in blue) and Republicans (in red) when
they were told presidential control over the CDC was high (“responsible”) and low (“not responsible”). The
point estimate is accompanied by a 95% confidence interval constructed using heteroskedasticity-robust HC2
standard errors. We measure presidential responsibility separately for each dimension using the question:
How responsible would you say the President is for [how CDC spends its money/ the quality of leadership
at the CDC/ the CDC’s strategies for fighting the COVID-19 outbreak]? (Not at all responsible, a little
responsible, somewhat responsible, mostly responsible, fully responsible).

E Experiment 3
E.1 Survey information
Platform: MTurk.
Dates: October 23-26, 2020 (wave 1); October 25-28, 2020 (wave 2)
Sample size: 3,572 (wave 1), 2,524 (wave 2).
Consent: Subjects read an IRB-approved consent form, then voluntarily consented to participate in a research study.
Refusal rate: 0 percent.
Compensation: $0.60. As the vendor does not set any standard rate, this amount was chosen
to exceed the hourly minimum wage in the United States.
No deception: As indicated in the approved IRB application, the experimental treatments
did not involve deception.
Real-world impact: As the experiment was conducted shortly before a presidential election,
the design (1) examined the intervention’s effect on preference between the major party
candidates and (2) excluded political independents, among whom our theory predicted the
strongest effect on candidate preference. We find no evidence that the treatment affected
candidate preferences (see Appendix E.5).
Recontact: In wave 1, 3,234 respondents identified themselves as a partisan or independent
leaner. We invited all of these respondents to complete the wave 2 survey. Of these, 2,524
completed the wave 2 survey (78 percent).
This table displays the dated on which respondents completed the surveys. In total, 101
respondents took the wave 2 survey on the same day as wave 1; 800, one day later; 956, two
days later; 443, three days later; 183, four days later; and 40, five days later.

Note: This figure plots the average response among Democrats (in blue) and Republicans (in red) when
they read positively and negatively framed performance information. The point estimate is accompanied
by a 95% confidence interval constructed using heteroskedasticity-robust HC2 standard errors. We measure
performance beliefs, separately for each dimension, using the question: Would you say the U.S. is doing a
good job or a bad job of [controlling the spread of COVID-19/ limiting the number of deaths from COVID-19/
testing for COVID-19/ developing treatments and vaccines for COVID-19]? (Very bad, fairly bad, neither
good nor bad, fairly good, very good).

E.6 Crosswalk to preanalysis plan
This section is designed to aid readers who wish to assess the consistency between the analysis
and the pre-analysis plan for experiment 3.
The pre-analysis plan specified seven hypotheses that would replicate results from the time
series data and the first two experiments:
• Hypothesis 1: parallel updating in response to information. Tested in the main text
subsection on experiment 3. See Figure 5 and surrounding text.
• Hypothesis 2: selective attribution by Democrats. Tested in the main text subsection
on experiment 3. See Figure 5 and surrounding text.
• Hypothesis 2: selective attribution by Republicans. Tested in the main text subsection
on experiment 3. See Figure 5 and surrounding text.
• Hypothesis 4: weak partisans identify more strongly with a party than do independents
leaning toward a party. Tested in the main text subsection on group identity and
selective attribution. See the left set of columns in Table 3 and surrounding text.
• Hypothesis 5: partisan differences in performance beliefs are more pronounced among
leaners than among weak partisans. Tested in the main text subsection on group identity and selective attribution. See the right set of columns in Table 3 and surrounding
text.
Note that due to a typographical or proofing error, the preregistration document reads
“partisan differences in selective attributions of responsibility” rather than “partisan
differences in performance beliefs.” The prespecified statistical test of this hypothesis
makes the document’s intent clear, as does the redundancy that that the error creates
between hypotheses 5 and 6.
• Hypothesis 6: selective attributions of responsibility are more pronounced among leaners. Tested in the main text subsection on group identity and selective attribution.
See Figure 6 and Table F.2.
• Hypothesis 7: same treatment effect on presidential vote choice. See Appendix E.5.
We supplemented this with four hypotheses that were generated entirely by our theory, and
were not designed to replicate any previous result.
• Hypothesis S1: performance beliefs moderate the treatment effect. See column 2 of
Tables 4, F.3, and F.4.
• Hypothesis S2: partisan identity moderates the treatment effect. See column 3 of Tables
4, F.3, and F.4.
77

• Hypothesis S3: independent of partisan identity, performance beliefs moderate the treatment effect. See column 4 of Tables 4, F.3, and F.4.
• Hypothesis S4: randomization check. See Appendix E.3.

Note: Table presents results for pre-registered hypothesis 6, regarding subgroup differences between leaners
and weak partisan identifiers. The reference group is respondents who do not identify with a political
party, but lean toward Democrats (“Democrat leaners”). The main coefficient of interest, β7 , suggests that
relative to leaners, weak partisan identifiers have an equal or slightly lesser tendency to selectively attribute
responsibility.
