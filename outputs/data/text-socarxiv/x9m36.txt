Abstract
Currently, many different countries are under lockdown or extreme social distancing
measures to control the spread of COVID-19. The potentially far-reaching side effects of these
measures have not yet been fully understood. In this study we analyse the results of a multicountry survey conducted in Italy (N=3,504), Spain (N=3,524) and the United Kingdom
(N=3,523), with two separate analyses. In the first analysis, we examine the elicitation of citizens’
concerns over the downplaying of the economic consequences of the lockdown during the
COVID-19 pandemic. We control for Social Desirability Bias through a list experiment included
in the survey. In the second analysis, we examine the data from the same survey to estimate the
consequences of the economic lockdown in terms of mental health, by predicting the level of
stress, anxiety and depression associated with being economically vulnerable and having been
affected by a negative economic shock. To accomplish this, we have used a prediction algorithm
based on machine learning techniques. To quantify the size of this affected population, we
compare its magnitude with the number of people affected by COVID-19 using measures of
susceptibility, vulnerability and behavioural change collected in the same questionnaire. We find
that the concern for the economy and for “the way out” of the lockdown is diffuse and there is
evidence of minor underreporting. Additionally, we estimate that around 42.8% of the
1

populations in the three countries are at high risk of stress, anxiety and depression, based on
their level of economic vulnerability and their exposure to a negative economic shock. Therefore,
it can be concluded that the lockdown and extreme social distancing in the three countries has
had an enormous impact on individuals’ mental health and this should be taken into account for
future decisions made on regulations concerning the pandemic.

In March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization
(WHO, 2020), and has rapidly brought most countries into a strict enforcement of extreme social
distancing. In particular, lockdown (that is, restrictions on movement, work and travel in order
to prevent contagion by persons potentially exposed to the virus) was first introduced in China
(23 January 2020) and later, in most of the world’s developed and developing countries. The
lockdown has brought economies to a sudden and extreme halt: modern economies function on
markets and markets require transactions and the mobility of factors. This mitigation strategy
was justified by the evidence that social distancing works in flattening the curve of contagion
and that it prevents health systems from being unable to cope (Barro, Ursúa, & Weng, 2020;
Drozd & Tavares, 2020; Correia et al., 2020; Lau et al. 2020; Markel et al., 2007; McSweeny et
al., 2007). A case in point is Italy, where in some regions (for example, Lombardy), the health
system came close to collapsing after the country was reluctant to take measures to prevent a
massive outbreak. The fear of having to deal with a similar situation contributed to convincing
governments around the world that imposing such lockdown measures was necessary, given the
notable reduction of the spread of the virus achieved in China (Tan et al., 2020; Wilder-Smith
and Freedman, 2020; Wu and McCoogan, 2020 ).
Nevertheless, the Italian case presents several areas of doubt that are under investigation in
order to determine whether or not they have had a causal impact: first, Italy has been reducing
health expenditure significantly since the 2010 euro crisis (Indolfi and Spaccarotella, 2020);
second, it is one of the countries with the lowest intensive care units per 10,000 inhabitants

(Rhodes et al., 2012); third, it has one of the oldest populations in Europe (De Natale et al.,
2020); and fourth, it is a society where the elderly have a high level of interaction with younger
generations (Surico and Galeotti, 2020). These have been reinforced by a delay in adjusting
protocols within hospitals; for example, avoiding the admittance of patients exhibiting mild
symptoms of COVID-19 (Pisano et al., 2020), which has the potential to transform hospitals
into clusters of contagion. This is reflected in the high mortality rate of medical personnel, in
comparative terms (51 died before the end of March in Italy, De Natale et al., 2020).
Designing an optimal mitigation strategy requires a consideration of the costs of measures
that are introduced (Stanczyk et al., 2020; Romer and Garber, 2020). In fact, there are strong
arguments to suggest that the negative consequences of lockdown may have been
underestimated and that they will have wide-reaching effects on various health dimensions, other
than on the virus itself. First, it has been argued that the suicide rate, mental health, domestic
violence, and the neglect of other health conditions (for example, cancers) may increase as a
result of the lockdown and social distancing measures (Brooks et al., 2020; Nagar and Formenti,
2020), however, these are not considered in the daily communications on the number of deaths
due to COVID-19. Second, there are concerns related to the negative consequences of income
shocks; for instance, data from applications for unemployment insurance have increased
exponentially in the US (currently at 33m according to the Department of Labor, and likely
underestimated, see Coibion et al., 2020). We know from studies on scarcity that this may cause
long-term problems in terms of cognitive resources and behavioural change (Mani et al. 2014),
and may weaken social cohesion and increase the crime rate once society is out of lockdown and
functioning normally again (Bignon et al., 2017; Dix-Carneiro et al., 2018). Third, there is a
fundamental argument that the current measures are driven by the precautionary principle and
not by cost-benefit analysis. Although reasonable a priori, the precautionary principle is usually
contested on two grounds: (a) if regulation is defended on the principle of the worst scenario,
then a lack of regulation can be defended by the same argument when the consequences of strict
regulations are potentially catastrophic; (b) the precautionary principle claims that fear should
not be downplayed, even if the numbers do not agree, but this exposes the risk that availability
cascades (the combination of availability heuristics and information cascade) dictate the agenda in
public policy (Sunstein, 2003, 2019). As an example, sub (a), one could argue against the
lockdown, ex ante, because it could cause the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression,
and sub (b) in favour of an indefinite extension of the lockdown, ex post, on the basis of the fear
of a new outburst of COVID-19.
Current scientific research on COVID-19 is increasingly focusing on the medical, physical
and social consequences of the crisis; showing that the virus is posing societal challenges across
multiple dimensions. Within social sciences, the current research has focused on perception and
attitudes (Fetzer et al., 2020), on the threat posed by COVID-19 related fake news (Pennycook,
McPhetres, Bago, & Rand, n.d.; Pennycook, McPhetres, Zhang, & Rand, 2020), and on designing
nudges and other social and behavioural measures to support the COVID-19 pandemic response
(Heffner et al,. n.d.; Bavel et al., 2020), among the others. Unsurprisingly, evidence on the
(mental health) side effects of the lockdown is largely missing, whereas in terms of contagion
(reduction), data gathering has been wide-spread and systematic (almost) everywhere. Some

evidence of the negative impact on mental health has been documented in China (Wang et al.,
2020; Liu et al., 2020), India (Roy et al., 2020), but mostly with convenience samples; yet, there
is a consensus that mental health will be dramatically affected (Nature Medicine (Editorial) 2020).
Given that the COVID-19 emergency has impacted developed countries before developing
countries, and that the latter have stronger constraints in terms of savings, social policy and
health infrastructure to face these problems, the assessment of the economic and health costs
should be considered an immediate priority for public policy. There is also a hypothesis
suggesting that the pandemic may last longer than 18 months and that periods of lockdown may
need to be re-introduced (with second and potentially even further waves of the virus); this
scenario also supports having enough evidence to make properly informed decisions (Lancet
(Editorial), 2020; Kissler et al., 2020).
In this article, we intend to fill this void of evidence on the various side effects of the COVID19 pandemic in the current literature by presenting the results of a multi-country (Italy, Spain
and the United Kingdom [UK]) survey. This article is divided in two parts, based on separate
analyses of the same data. In the first part, we elicit the level of concerns by citizens across three
countries over the claim that the mitigation strategies used to contain COVID-19 have been
neglecting or underestimating the magnitude of the economic consequences (Atkeson, 2020;
McKee and Stuckler, 2020). In the second part, we attempt to map how these concerns for the
economic consequences of the lockdown are related to mental health issues. In the multi-country
survey, we assess the level of stress, anxiety and depression in the population as predicted by
economic vulnerability (for example, low socio-economic background, low residential space,
etc.), with the aim of identifying the potential size of mental health problems due to the side
effects of the lockdown.
For the first part of this study, the outcome variables studied in this contribution are the level
of support given to the following statements: “During the pandemic, the government should
not only focus on preventing contagion but also on avoiding a major economic crisis”; and,
“During the pandemic, the government should not only communicate to citizens what to do to
adhere to the safety measures, but also clearly explain how it is planning the way out”. The first
statement refers to the need to balance the losses in the domain of the pandemic and of the
economy, as this need has been dismissed by part of the scientific community in favour of a
unidimensional policy approach based on the precautionary principle (Anderson et al., 2020).
The second statement refers to the need for transparent communication in order to allow
households to plan their consumption, labour and investments during the year (Brooks et al.,
2020).
If there is strong support for these two statements, we anticipate that such concerns will be
reflected in various forms of stress associated with new sources of economic uncertainty and
vulnerability, which we investigate in the second part of this study. Indeed, in the second part,
the outcome variables are self-reported stress, anxiety and depression.
Stress occurs when the level of stimuli exceeds a human body’s regulatory capacity. Anxiety
is a reaction to stress, with feelings of worry, nervousness or unease. Depression is a serious
medical illness concerning feelings and emotions, and is usually associated with sadness and loss
of interest causing a lack of ability to function in individuals (Beck and Beamesderfer, 1974).

Stress, anxiety and depression are used in this study to measure mental health (Cohen and
Williamson, 1991).
In conducting these two analyses, we attempt to make three contributions in terms of
estimating the side effects of the lockdown in response to COVID-19. First, we elicit support
for the two statements related to the risk of neglecting the economic consequences. Since there
is a clear social desirability bias (SDB) on this matter, we use a list experiment (included in the
survey) to control for this. This is important because real support by citizens is fundamental to
guarantee adherence to policy interventions, and because opposition to the current regulatory
framework can be a predictor of the loss of social cohesion in the medium term.
Second, we estimate the extent to which the socio-economic background of a household can
predict perceived stress, anxiety and other mental health issues in relation to the current
pandemic and its consequences. To estimate the dimension of mental health related to the
economic side effects of the lockdown, we use machine learning techniques (random forest) to
predict the likelihood of being highly stressed, conditional on a number of critical factors; such
as, organising home-schooling, having only a small living space, a low financial buffer stock,
having suffered previous negative economic shocks, and so on. To provide some comparative
quantification for this impact, we quantify through the same questionnaire the three components
of exposure to COVID-19; namely susceptibility (the risk associated with the illness once
contracted), vulnerability (the risk of exposure), and the behavioural response (people asking to
be tested or contacting a doctor or health authorities due to COVID-19).
An additional contribution of this work is that it is a multi-country study of Italy, Spain and
the UK. These countries have a high number of deaths in common and are currently among the
harshest hit in Europe. They have also adopted quarantine and lockdown measures, but with
some difference in degree (for example, the UK first announced an alternative strategy based on
herd immunity before later reverting to the lockdown strategy). Finally, the timing for the curve
of contagion in the three countries has differed (the sequence being first Italy, second Spain and
last the UK), and this gives us a variation in terms of length of exposure to lockdown. These
features increase the external validity of the study.
Our first theoretical hypothesis is that experiencing lockdown and a lack of transparent
communication on how to move in an orderly fashion towards a post-lockdown scenario
increases the focus on the economic situation by citizens. This is consistent with the hypothesis
that frustration and demoralization are exacerbated by a lack of commitment to keep the
lockdown to as short a duration as possible, and that extensions may backfire (Brooks et al.,
2020). Another potential channel is the scarcity mind-set: having to face negative economic
shocks may increase the tendency of citizens to think in terms of opportunity cost and tradeoff, becoming more focused on economic consequences (Shah et al., 2015).
Our second hypothesis is that adverse economic conditions worsen psychological wellbeing.
Studies on the relationship between economic contraction and mental health have shown that
the relationship between adverse economic experiences and depression is one of the most
consistent findings (Goldman-Mellor, Saxton, & Catalano, 2010; Wahlbeck, Anderson, Basu,
McDaid, & Stuckler, 2011). Participants in these studies who lost their jobs for reasons unrelated
to health had a greater chance of experiencing depressive symptoms, even after controlling for

workforce experience, mental ability and socioeconomic variables. Indeed, not only job loss but
also the type of work contract is associated with mental health issues. People who move from
stable to inadequate employment demonstrate an increased risk of depression. In their review,
Wahlbeck et al. (2012) gathered evidence showing that people who experienced unemployment
or impoverishment are at a greater risk of suffering from depression, alcohol abuse and suicide
than people who did not. This problem is clearly aggravated for a household in a vulnerable
situation, since a low economic background offers less monetary and cultural resources to cope
with adversity.
Results
List Experiment. A list experiment is a questionnaire design technique used to mitigate the
respondent’s social desirability bias (SDB) when eliciting information about sensitive topics.
With a large enough sample size, list experiments can be used to estimate the proportion of
people for whom a sensitive statement is true. We measured the level of agreement with the
following two statements:
• During the pandemic, the government should not only focus on preventing contagion but also on avoiding
a major economic crisis;
• During the pandemic, the government should not only communicate to citizens what to do to adhere to
the safety measures, but also clearly explain how it is planning the way out.
To prevent SDB from biasing the results, we considered four additional and unrelated
statements (see Materials and Methods), which are not the object of analysis, and we asked
participants to state how many (rather than which) statements they agreed with.
We proceeded in the following way. We selected at random four subsamples of participants
and asked them to perform the following tasks: the control group is presented with four
statements, without using the controversial ones above, and is asked how many they agree with;
treatment group one is presented with a set of five statements (four of the control and the first
statement object of analysis) and is asked how many statements they agree with; treatment group
two is presented with a set of five statements (four of the control and the second statement
object of analysis) and is asked how many statements they agree with; last, treatment group three
is asked direct questions; that is, after being presented with the full set of six statements, it is
asked which statements they agree with.
As a result, comparing the average number of items selected in the control with the average
number of items selected in treatment one (two) group, we detect the share of people who agree
with the first (second) controversial statement. By comparing the share of people who agree with
a controversial statement, as estimated through the list treatment, with the share of people who
declared that they agreed with it (from the direct questions in treatment group three), we can
estimate the SDB.
In total, 10,551 participants answered the questionnaire: 3,504 in Italy, 3,524 in Spain and
3,523 in the UK. We provide a set of statistical tests to assess the balancing of covariates (a
dummy for female, age, a dummy for marital status, a dummy for unemployed, household size,
the number of children of school age, country dummies, income level, educational level, a
dummy for homeownership, and the size of the house) in Table S1 in the Supplementary Online
Material (SOM). Covariates are not systematically different across the four groups, but we reject

the null hypothesis for some of them. All of the covariates included in Table S1 are used as
controls in the regressions.
In Figures 1 and 2 below, we report the estimated support for the statements in the three
countries and in the overall sample, and the extent of SDB, after controlling for a set of
covariates. In the full sample, support for statement 1 is 62.09% estimated through the list
experiment (t=25.34, p<.000), and 56.48% by direct method (t=244.62, p<.000). In the three
countries, the results are as follows: in Italy, the average support revealed by the list experiment
is 67.58% and 63.50% when asked directly; in Spain, the average support is 58.93% through the
list method, and 56.03% through the direct method; and in the UK, it is 59.86% and 50.13%,
respectively. Data support the presence of SDB (t=480.10, p<.000). All of the supporting
regressions are reported in the SOM, Tables S2-S4.
Similar results hold for statement 2, the support of which is 69.65% when estimated through
the list experiment (t=29.02, p<.000), and 66.29% by direct method (t=294.78, p<.000). In the
three countries, the results are as follows: in Italy, the average support revealed by the list
experiment is 64.57% through the list method and 64.93% through the direct method; in Spain,
the average support is 72.20% through the list method, and 69.43% through the direct method;
and in the UK, it is 72.49% and 64.33%, respectively. The data fail to reject the absence of SDB
(t=387.10, p<.000). All of the supporting regressions are reported in the SOM, Tables S2-S4.
In Table S5 in the SOM, we report the frequencies for the number of items chosen, by
treatment and country.
As argued by Blair and Imai (2012), the implicit assumptions in a list experiment are the
absence of design effect and absence of liars. These assumptions state, respectively, that answers
to uncontroversial statements do not change when controversial statements are added, and that
participants do answer truthfully. The latter is untestable. The statistical procedure we use is one
suggested by Blair and Imai (2012). These tests are reported in the SOM, Tables S6-S9. We fail
to reject the null hypotheses of the absence of design effect. These results suggest that our
inferences from the list experiments have robust internal validity.

Economic vulnerability and negative shocks predict mental health. Levels of stress,
anxiety and depression were measured through an adapted version of the DASS-21 (Depression,
Anxiety and Stress Scale–21 Items; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995) and of SASRQ (Stanford
Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire; Cardeña, Koopman, Classen, Waelde, & Spiegel, 2000).
Responses are elicited over a Likert scale from 1 to 4, where the items correspond to: rarely or
none of the time (less than one day); some or a little of the time (1-2 days); occasionally or a
moderate amount of time (3-4 days); most or all of the time (5-7 days).
In the Table 1 below, we report for each item the share of people who report having felt
the symptoms at least one or two days in the previous week. The instrument is reliable
(Cronbach’s alpha is 0.91). The outcome variable is then normalized on a 0.25 to 1 scale,
averaging across the eight items.

As suggested by our theoretical hypotheses, stress is highly correlated with economic
vulnerability and exposure to a negative economic shock. In Table 2 below, we report Spearman
correlations, in order to capture potential non-linearity and to minimize the effect of atypical
values or response error. According to Table 2, a higher income level is associated with lower
stress (rho=-.04, p<.01), being unemployed is positively correlated with stress (rho=.09, p<.01),
owning a house is negatively correlated (rho=-.08, p<.01), having a larger house space is
negatively correlated (rho=-.10, p<.01), household size (rho=.10, p<.01) and especially having
children of school age are positively correlated (rho=.12, p<.01), financial buffer stock (the time
that bills can be covered after losing a job) is negatively correlated (rho=-.18, p<.01), having
faced negative events is positively correlated (rho=.38, p<.01), as is having suffered job or
income losses (rho=.19, p<.01). This is in line with our theoretical hypotheses.

‘Household income’ is a categorical variable with the categories described in Q5 (SOM). ‘Unemployed’ is a dummy
variable with a value of 1 if the respondent is in search of a job and 0 otherwise. ‘Homeownership’ is a dummy
variable with the value of 1 if the respondent type of dwelling is owned and fully paid. ‘Living area’ is the

To quantify the extent of mental health issues associated with economic vulnerability and
worsened economic conditions, we cannot rely on ex ante-ex post variation due to the lack of a
pre-pandemic data point, and we do not have a source of exogenous variations of negative
economic shocks and vulnerability. As a result, we compute the conditional probability of being
under high stress, anxiety and depression given the independent variables in Table 1, being fully
aware that we cannot claim causality. We estimate a standard random forest model between the
outcome variable and the set of independent variables. We set the model using 550 iterations
(trees) and regression as type of the decision tree. After computing the regression model, we
estimate the share of those who are highly affected (outcome variable greater than or equal to
.5) and project over the entire population, post-stratifying on age, gender and macro-region of
residence. We compute that mental health problems predicted by the economic vulnerability and
negative economic shock are 41.5% in Italy, 45.8% in Spain and 41.8% in the UK. Weighting
for the population, this accounts for 42.8% in the three countries.
In the SOM (see Figures S1-S2 and Table S10), we report the fit of the model (Spearman
rank-order correlation coefficient=0.9168, p=0.0000), the out-of-bag error convergence, which
stabilizes after 400 iterations at somewhere below 0.16, and the matrix of variable importance
for each variable used when building the classifier. The results are highly correlated when we
compare total sample and out of sample prediction with 15%, 25%, 33%, and 50% of the sample
for learning (see SOM, Section 2, Table S16-S17). From the diagnostic tests, we conclude in
favour of the robustness of the exercise.

One legitimate question is whether or not 42.8% represents many: the most obvious answer
is to compare the exposure to mental health with the exposure to COVID-19 since the lockdown
has been introduced to contain the risk of the pandemic.
There are three routes to estimate exposure to COVID-19: susceptibility, vulnerability and
behavioural response. Susceptibility refers to how strong the impact is when an individual is
affected by the virus. We already know from the literature that age, specific health problems and
comorbidity (in particular Diabetes, Hypertension, Asthma, Cardiovascular Disease, Cancer
according to Guan, et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020; Richardson et al., 2020), and poor health
conditions are all key factors that augment the negative consequences of contracting the disease.
We collect this information through the questionnaire (SOM, Questionnaires Q18-21 and Q25).
Vulnerability is the likelihood of getting the illness and is typically associated with communitarian
exposure. We measure this component by eliciting the factors preventing full compliance with
the quarantine (see SOM, Questionnaire, Q15). Finally, the behavioural response is elicited
through questions on having contacted doctors or health authorities, or having sought to get
tested (SOM, Questionnaires Q17g and Q24). We report these results in the SOM, Tables S11S13.
Obviously, comparing each variable in each dimension with the predicted likelihood of being
stressed conditional on vulnerability and shock is not highly informative, because we would get
a difference response from different comparison. To meaningfully summarize the information
of the variables in each dimension of exposure to COVID-19, we perform a principal
component analysis (that is, we represent each dimension -variable space- through a set of
uncorrelated variables), which captures the largest part of its variability. In the three cases,
sampling adequacy is acceptable (KMO sampling adequacy is 0.73 for susceptibility, 0.72 for
vulnerability and 0.72 for behavioural response, see SOM, Table S15), and in all three cases the
first component is the only one with an associated eigenvalue greater than one (2.5 for
susceptibility, 50% of variance explained; 2.25 for vulnerability, 45% of variance explained; 2.22
for behavioural response, 55% of variance explained): thus, we can use the associated
eigenvector (see SOM, Table S14) to build a score, increasing in the level of exposure.
As a result, we built four indexes, all scaled from 0.25 to one, three for exposure to COVID19 and one for exposure to stress. Of course, defining a threshold in the first three scores (for
example, .5 as in the stress case) would be completely arbitrary, since there is no clear cardinality
in the scale of the score. To prevent arbitrary choices from biasing the comparison, we plot the
cumulative density function; that is, for any value of the index x, the share of respondents who
have x at most, P(x≤ x). Figure 3 plots the results and shows that stress stochastically dominates
two out of the other three distributions at the first order. Formally, this can be written as
P(stress≤ x) ≤ P(j≤ x) for all x between zero and one, and for j=susceptibility, vulnerability and
behavioural response. Graphically, this can be seen from the fact that the distribution of
predicted stress stands to the right of the susceptibility and behavioural change, but almost
coincide with that of vulnerability. In simple words, for any level of the score from 0.25 to 1,
the likelihood of observing more people exposed above the selected level at least equal for stress
than for any other measure of exposure to COVID-19.

Discussion
In this study, we collect and analyse data from three European countries (Italy, Spain,
and the United Kingdom), which have been under lockdown due to the recent outbreak of the
COVID-19 pandemic that began in China in late 2019. The aim of the study is to measure the
support for two statements related to the importance of the economic consequences of
mitigation strategies and to measure the consequences of the lockdown in terms of mental
health, as predicted by economic vulnerability and negative economic shocks. The hypotheses
are that economic depression induces more worry for citizens regarding their economic
situation, and that sharp negative economic shocks worsen psychological wellbeing.
This study shows a prevalence of concern for the unidimensional policy orientation
during the pandemic on protecting the current healthcare systems, by putting aside other
important elements of societies currently hit by the COVID-19 crises, which is in line with recent
other studies (Colbourn, 2020; Alwan et al., 2020). In particular, we found sizable support for a
more traditional view of government as minimizing a loss function defined over different
problems, health and the economic crisis, in this case. We also found general support for the
idea that governments should communicate a coherent way out of the crisis: from an economic
point of view, this involves asking the government to commit to certain long-term objectives to

allow a household to reasonably protect itself from uncertainty and achieve a more reasonable
solution in terms of consumption smoothing and investment (the same applies for businesses
and companies). Most countries have stressed that it is imperative to delay and flatten the curve
of the pandemic in order to ensure that national health services can cope with the resulting
situation, and indeed, most governments have asserted that their responses to the COVID-19
pandemic are based on evidence and expert modelling. Nevertheless, different scientists have
arrived at different conclusions based on the same evidence: small differences in assumptions
can lead to large differences in modelling predictions, as can be seen in the different regulations
implemented by EU Member States, and beyond (Anderson, Heesterbeek, Klinkenberg, &
Hollingsworth, 2020).
Another important finding of this study is that economic vulnerability is associated with
a strong risk of stress and worsening mental health. We estimated that around 42.8% of the
population is at risk because of the negative shocks and the conditions of economic vulnerability
in the developed countries in which we have conducted our study. This suggests that in
developing countries, which must still face the worst part of the health emergency and the
economic consequences of potential governmental regulations, the consequences may be even
worse. The pattern we encountered is similar across the three countries we study (Italy, Spain
and the UK), even though the timing of the quarantine and the initial strategy by the government
in each country has differed, with the UK first announcing the intention to pursue herd
immunity, but then also rapidly shifting towards standard isolation measures. Moreover, these
results have strong external validity because of the representativeness of the sample in the three
countries.
Our results have additional implications: while the epidemiological literature has
expended a great deal of effort in profiling citizens according to their COVID-19 risk, our article
suggests that a similar task can be successfully conducted in order to maintain societal resilience
to mental health problems (Duan and Zhu, 2020) and the resilience of the health system (Liu et
al., 2020; Legido-Quigley et al., 2020). The social and economic effects of lockdown and other
interventions that have halted the economy will have an immense impact on health care in the
near future, including mental health, but also on interpersonal violence. These factors should be
extensively empirically evaluated and incorporated into future models for global crises, such as
the one we currently face (Colbourn, 2020). Models and projections that provide a deeper
understanding of how decisions are made should become available in the public (and scientific)
domains without delay, in order to inspire public trust and allow a wider and potentially more
beneficial input (Alwan et al., 2020).
Our study has further public health implications, in terms of how to address these mental
health problems. As suggested by Brooks et al. (2020), during the pandemic, therapy is obviously
limited, and mild interventions such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy or Mindfulness can be
adapted to deal with the negative consequences of exposure.
One of the strengths of the current study is that we have assessed the differences
between the three European countries studied, as they have all been significantly affected by
COVID-19, while there are significant differences in each of their regulatory interventions.
Second, considering the wide variety of studies published on this topic, we would argue that a
14

deeper analysis on the effects of the regulatory interventions on mental health within society is
missing but highly necessary in order to better understand the effects of these regulations. Third,
we have collected data from a large group of representative citizens, thereby being able to
generalize the outcomes.
Naturally, our study has limitations. First, although we have external validity within the
three countries, we cannot claim generalizability to Europe or the world. This is somewhat
unavoidable in the current situation in which there are environmental conditions that are
important, as reflected in the heterogeneity in the death rate, but whose role is not fully
understood.
Another limitation is due to the self-reported measurement levels of mental health.
Although highly reliable, these questions do not represent medical data. However, autoptic
recognition of mental health is a necessary step in providing a medical assessment, and as a
result, it could be noisier, but it is unlikely to be biased in the opposite direction with respect to
more clinical measurements. Additionally, we used a validated scale.
Third, the comparison between the exposure to stress and the exposure to COVID-19
is subject to critique. Although stochastic dominance is a conservative test the latter have been
obtained through a filter (principal component analysis). This suggest that there may be some
non-linear combination of the underlying variables (that is, some way in which to aggregate the
information into a single dimension), for which the proposition no longer holds.
As has been argued, mental health could be the next threat to our societies, based on the
conditions of the mitigation strategies and the hard-hitting economic depression that will likely
follow. Mapping this evolution in terms of the population at risk, providing creative policy
solutions that do not compromise the results achieved in terms of flattening the curve of
contagion, and maintaining the resilience of our health system should be included among the
future research priorities. Based on these results, it is also important for countries that are behind
in controlling the spread of the virus, or vis-a-vis future outbreaks, to design ex ante more
balanced mitigation strategies so as to prevent some of the side effects of lockdown and
quarantine manifesting themselves.

Materials and Methods
We submit a link through an online panel in Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. We
restrict participants to 18-75 years old. Although this is underestimating the impact on a subset
of the population which is highly vulnerable to COVID-19, access to them through the online
channel and the reliability of responses may be highly questionable. The initial sample is
randomized. The study is preregistered on OSF (DOI:10.17605/OSF.IO/6XWE8). The
English version of the questionnaire can be found in the Supplementary Online Materials,
Section 1.
Ethics approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the Universitat
Oberta de Catalunya. All respondents provided informed consent.
In the list experiment, we have four treatments. The control group is presented with four
statements, without any of the controversial ones, and is asked how many they agree with;

treatment group one is presented with a set of five statements (four of the control and the first
statement object of analysis), and is asked how many statements they agree with; treatment group
two is presented with a set of five statements, (four of the control and the second statement
object of analysis), and is asked how many statements they agree with; last, treatment group three
is asked direct questions; that is, after being presented with the full set of six statements, it is
asked which statements they agree with. Assignment to treatments is as follows: 30% of the
sample is randomly assigned to the control group, 30% to treatment group one, 30% to
treatment group two, and 10% to treatment group three. The group with a direct question is
smaller because the standard errors in direct response are much reduced than in the list
experiment.
Uncontroversial items are: “Globalization has benefitted most of the population in the
world”, “Immigration is a threat for our lifestyle”, “The health professionals are facing the largest
risk in this pandemic”, “On important policy issues, the government should always follow the
opinion of the experts”. Notice that we choose the first two and the fourth statements because
people tend to have polarized opinions on them, and this guarantees that we are not facing
ceiling effects. We add the third statement to ensure that we include a statement which is healthrelated, and that we do not prime participants too strongly towards reflecting on economic costs.
To analyse the list experiment, we followed Blair and Imai (2012), and used linear
regressions, since we are not primarily interested in the identification of the impact of covariates.
We used the following control variables, which in principle should not be causally affected by
the treatment: a dummy for female, age, a dummy for marital status, a dummy for unemployed,
household size, the number of children of school age, country dummies, income level,
educational level, a dummy for homeownership, and the size of the house.
We measured stress, anxiety and depression through an adapted version of the DASS21 (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale – 21 Items; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995) and of
SASRQ (Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire; Cardeña, Koopman, Classen, Waelde,
& Spiegel, 2000). The last questionnaire was created to measure acute reactions to stress, which
means that the instrument is used to measure stress due to a specific stressor, not a general
measure of stress (Cardeña et al., 2000). Our questionnaire is close to the one used by the multicountry study of Fetzer et al. (2020). This is an eight-items scale, with answers from one to four.
To estimate the relationship between the factors of economic vulnerability and exposure to
negative economic shocks and stress, anxiety and depression we used a random forest model,
with bootstrapping, using 550 iterations. We used the following predictors in the model:
household income, a dummy for unemployed, a dummy for homeownership, living space,
household size, number of children of school age, financial buffer stock, negative events the
occurred in the previous week, and change in income or earnings (SOM, Questionnaire, Q5, Q7,
Q9, Q10, Q11, Q13, Q17a/b/c/d/e/f/h/i, Q27).
To project the results to the overall population, we post-stratified the results using
gender, age (18-35; 36-55; 56-75) and residence (North; Centre; South; Isles for Italy, Madrid
and Centre; Barcelona and West; North; Centre-East; South for Spain; East and Midlands,
London, South; North; Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for the UK). Data are taken from
Eurostat.
Finally, to summarize susceptibility, vulnerability and behavioural response, we
performed principal component analysis. We assessed sampling adequacy using the Keyser16

Meyer-Olkin criterion. In all cases, we retain the component based on the eigenvalues greater
than one. Stochastic dominance is assessed graphically.
