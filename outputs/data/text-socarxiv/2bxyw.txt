A BSTRACT
In many parts of the world, the social mobility restrictions and stay-at-home orders introduced during the
early months of the COVID-19 pandemic have been associated with significant reductions in crime. However, contrary to this general finding, illicit drug offence detections increased significantly. In this study, we
explore the geographical distribution of the increase in Queensland, Australia, using spatiotemporal generalised additive model (GAM) to identify locations in the Local Government Area (LGA) of Brisbane where
drug offence detection rates were unusually high during the three months of the COVID-19 lockdown (AprilJune 2020). Contrary to expectation, we find that the increase in drug offence detection rates appears to have
been modest in most places, but widespread and diffuse throughout the city. We conclude that drug offence
detections are most likely to have increased incidentally, probably as a consequence of general street policing
initiatives which saw an increase in the visibility and vulnerability of drug user communities. We do, however, identify five locations in Brisbane where the drug offence detection rate exceeded the prediction by a
considerable margin (in one case, more than double the worst case prediction). We argue that in these locations the increase was likely the result of some spatial displacement of inner-city drug markets coupled with
a series of targeted policing activities. Further research is needed to clarify the true mechanism of change in
these locations.

Introduction
The global health and social policy response to COVID-19 has been highly variable. In Australia, efforts to curb transmission
centred on an almost immediate halt to international passenger arrivals along with strict stay-at-home and social distancing regulations. Although each state and territory managed their local risks through a unique set of public health orders (O’Sullivan et
al., 2020), Australia as a whole has been heralded as a significant public health success story (Glover, 2021 see also O’Sullivan
et al., 2020). However, extreme interventions of the kind seen in Australia are not without their consequences. Strict orders
to ‘stay-at-home’ and a heavy investment in the policing of public health orders is likely to have a disproportionate effect on
vulnerable individuals and communities (Bonn, 2020). One potential indicator of this disparity, as demonstrated by Langfield,
Payne and Makkai (2021), is the statistically significant increase in the police detection of drug offences (possession, in particular) while all other recorded crime rates were significantly below trend through the earliest months of the pandemic (see, for
example, Ashby, 2020a, 2020b; Campedelli, Aziani, et al., 2020; Campedelli, Favarin, et al., 2020; Payne et al., 2020, 2021).
There is not likely to be a single reason for the increase in drug offence detections. Some have argued that the emotional
and social pressure of lockdown may have led to an increase in rates of community-level drug use (Australian Bureau of
Statistics, 2020; Dietze and Peacock, 2020; Lee and Bartle, 2020; McGowan, 2020), although we are sceptical that an increase
in community-level drug use could translate so rapidly into a substantially higher rate of police detection. A second explanation
is that, as other crime types fell, residual policing resources were redirected to general street-based policing activity or possibly
even targeted activities in known hotspots. Some anecdotal evidence supports this view (Levin and Kashyap, 2020); however,

we think that the rapid increase in police drug detection is more likely a result of incidental detection rather than the targeted
and purposive actions of the police. A third explanation argues that there was no change in drug use or drug market activity,
but that those who participate in drug markets suddenly became more vulnerable to police detection as urban centres and
city streets were deserted during lockdown (Dietze and Peacock, 2020). The compulsive nature of drug dependency, coupled
with the socioeconomic vulnerability of drug user communities, likely means that drug markets remained active despite the
government’s order to stay-at-home (see Eligh, 2020; Hamilton and Stevens, 2020; Namli, 2021; Winstock et al., 2020) and
this activity was likely more visible to law enforcement.
These competing hypotheses have been developed mostly in response to the evidence of aggregate data showing state-wide or
city-wide changes in drug offence arrest rates (see Andresen and Hodgkinson, 2020; Langfield et al., 2021). Few studies have
drilled down into the geospatial data to examine the spatiotemporal patterns and their implications for understanding both drug
markets and policing during the pandemic. We argue here that different patterns signal different mechanisms and this can be
valuable for understanding how drug users, drug sellers and police responded to the pandemic. For example, we might expect
intensive police targeting of known drug markets to have resulted in a small number of drug offence detection clusters where the
detection rates far exceeded normal expectations. In addition we might also expect these clusters to be temporary if the market
interdiction efforts were of the kind normally described as ‘hotspot interventions’ or ‘crack downs’ (see Mazerolle et al., 2007
and Mazerolle et al., 2020). Conversely, if drug offence detections were incidental to other policing activities and mostly the
result of an increase in the visibility and vulnerability of drug market participants, then we might expect the increase to manifest
across a larger and more widely spread number of locations, each with a relatively modest increase overall. In any case, the
spatiotemporal pattern of drug offence detections will likely contain valuable insights about the mechanisms of change during
COVID-19.

A PREPRINT - M AY 2021

This current study uses a spatiotemporal generalised additive model to identify geographical locations in the Local Government
Area of Brisbane, Australia, where drug offence detection rates were unusually high during the three months of the COVID-19
lockdown (April-June 2020). We operationalise three separate indicators of change. The first is a binary indicator identifying
locations where the detection rate surpassed the model-derived upper 95% prediction interval in at least one of the three months
of the lockdown. The second measure examines whether the increase was temporary or sustained, counting for each location
the number of months that drug offence detections were statistically higher than predicted. The final measure considers the
relative extent to which the actual detection rate exceeded the worst case prediction at each location. In this case, we calculate
the number of detections above the upper 95% prediction interval (i.e. ‘excess’ detections) and we divide that number by the
same interval. The result is a relative measure of ‘excess’ where, for example, a location with 15 drug detections and an upper
95% interval of 10 would have 5 excess offences for a relative ‘excess’ of 50%. We then map the outcomes of each measure
and describe their spatial distribution.

Method
At its heart, this study is an analysis of prediction error. Specifically, it explores the difference between the actual rate of drug
offence detection with a model predicted geospatial estimate for the three month period of the COVID-19 lockdown. The
site of our analysis is the Local Government Area of Brisbane, which is the capital city of Queensland, Australia, and where
the government mandated stay-at-home and social distancing regulations were in-place for the three months of April, May
and June, 20202 (Queensland Department of the Premier and Cabinet, 2020; Queensland Government, 2020a, 2020c). In the
international context, Australia is a particularly unique and important study site for a number of reasons. First, Australia has
had comparatively few COVID-19 cases (just 30,000 cases in total, as at May 1, 2021 (Australian Government Department
of Health, 2020)) and, relative to other countries, very little community transmission (Australian Government Department
of Health, 2020). Second, Australia was an early adopter of some of the most stringent social-distancing and stay-at-home
regulations seen across the world (Chang et al., 2020; O’Sullivan et al., 2020). Third, the so-called lockdowns in Australia were
relatively short in comparison to other countries and most state and territory jurisdictions were ‘opening up’ in a context of
low or no community transmission as early as July 2020 (O’Sullivan et al., 2020). Finally, being in the global south, Australia
was heading into the cooler months of autumn as the pandemic hit – a time when, in the annual cycle, crime rates are usually
trending down (McDowall et al., 2012).
Our data are drawn from the Queensland Government’s Open Data Portal (Queensland Government, 2020b) where unit records
for all drug offence detections are available for the past 5 years. We have used the full complement of all data that was
available at the time of download (from April 2016 to June 2020). For this study we model the data at Level 2 of the Australian
Geographical Standard (herein described as SA2), which define statistical boundaries of communities where there is an average
of 10,000 residents who ‘interact socially and economically’ (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2011). There are 135 SA2s
within the Brisbane Local Government Area, however for the purposes of this study we have excluded seven commercial or
recreational locations which have zero or very few residents.3
Modelling strategy and outcomes
Our model is built within a generalised additive framework4 (GAM) using a spatio-temporal tensor product for the interaction
between geography and time. Specifically, geospatial correlation (i.e. the predictable statistical relationship between neighbouring locations) is captured through a spatial thin-plate spline (see Figure 2) and the long term trends and seasonality of
the series (i.e. the predictable patterns across the 12 months of each year) is captured through a cubic regression spline. Six
location-specific covariates were included to explain any residual variance not captured in the geospatial correlation. These

The Queensland Government introduced its first restrictions on gatherings on 19 March, with no non-essential indoor gatherings of over
100 people and no non-essential outdoor gatherings of over 500 people allowed. On 24 March, all non-essential businesses (e.g., bars, gyms,
cafes) were directed to close. State border restrictions were introduced on 25 March, whereby all arrivals to Queensland had to complete
mandatory quarantine for 14 days. Indoor gatherings were restricted to no more than 10 people on 27 March, and people were directed to
stay-at-home unless for essential reasons from 29 March. 31 March saw the closure of the Queensland border to all non-essential travel. On
2 April, indoor gatherings were further restricted to no more than 2 people, and Queensland schools closed on 4 April, except for students
of essential workers and those deemed as vulnerable. Students began distance learning on 20 April. May saw the easing of restrictions, first
with the return of younger grades and senior high school students to the classroom on 4 May. By the 25 May, all school students had returned
to the classroom. June and July saw the easing of indoor gathering restrictions, first to no more than 20 people (1 June) and then to no more
than 100 people (3 July).

We note that drug detections can occur in locations with no or very few residents; however, we have erred on the side of per-capita
standardisation using the usual resident population estimate as the denominator. Comparable ‘rates’ could not be estimated for locations and
time periods when drug detections did occur, but where there is no resident population against which to calculate a standardised rate.

The GAM framework is not new and has elsewhere been used to model and predict the spatiotemporal patterns of such things as mean
global temperatures (see, for example, Peristeraki et al., 2019).

covariates were: (1) the relative preponderance of businesses providing the Food and Accommodation services; (2) the relative
preponderance of businesses catering to Retail services; (3) the relative economic prosperity of local residents; (4) the relative
education and occupation status of local residents; (5) the proportion of local residents that are aged between 15 and 24 (i.e.
young adults); and (6) the proportion of local residents that were born overseas.

As for the local business data, we have used SA2 level estimates reported by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and
scaled these estimates into a relative measure for the Brisbane LGA. Where the relevant measure for an SA2 is coded as zero,
this means that the number of businesses in that SA2 is equal to the average of all SA2s in the Brisbane LGA. A value of one
(1) indicates an SA2 where the number of businesses is one standard deviation above the average for the region. For economic,
education and occupation indicators we use the Index of Economic Resources (IER) and the Index of Education and Occupation
(IER) derived by the ABS from the most recent Census of the Population (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2016). As with the
local business data, we have standardised this to the average of all SA2s in the Brisbane LGA such that zero indicates an area
where the IER or IEO score was equal to the average score across the region. Finally, we use Census data to measure the
number of young adults (aged 15-24) and the number of residents born overseas as percentages of the local population.
For modelling purposes, we execute the analysis on data from April 2016 to March 2020 (48 months), holding out data for the
three months when COVID-19 restrictions were in place (April-June 2020). We then use the model parameters to predict the
crime rate for each location and each month of the COVID-19 lockdown. Recognising the inevitable presence of prediction
uncertainty and the likelihood that the degree of this error will vary from location to location, we use a Bayesian simulation
procedure to compute 10,000 simulations of the model predictions at each location. From this we generate 95% prediction

intervals to reflect the range of values within which we should confidently expect the true value to fall had the COVID-19
lockdown not occured.
The statistical model parameters and model diagnostics are provided in Figure 3. Overall, the model explains approximately
85% of the variance. Both spatiotemporal smooth terms are statistically significant (EDF=220, p=0.00 and EDF=25, p=0.00).
This tells us that there is strong spatial correlation which changes both in the long term (trend) and in a predictable seasonal
pattern. Of the locations-specific covariates, the model shows that pre-COVID, drug offence detections were higher in locations
where there are more retail businesses (b=0.16, p=0.02), and higher in locations with higher levels of economic disadvantage
(b=-0.69, p=0.00), but lower in areas with a higher proportion of young adults (b=-0.05, p=0.00) and/or residents born overseas
(b=-0.02, p=0.03).

Identifying hotspots
A comparison of the actual and predicted drug offence detection rate is used to compute three measures of ‘change’. Our first
measure is a binary indicator of any location where the drug offence detection rate was higher than the 95% prediction interval
for at least one of three months during the COVID-19 lockdown. We consider this to be an informative, albeit liberal, hotspot
indicator because even in the absence of COVID-19 one should reasonably expect 5 percent of monthly detection rates to exceed
their 95% prediction intervals. Our second indicator, therefore, identifies locations where the drug offence detection rate was
higher than predicted for two or three of the lockdown months. This we consider to be highly unlikely in the context of normal
fluctuations. The third measure examines what we describe as ‘excess’ drug offence detections. These are locations where, over
the three month lockdown, there was an ‘excess’ of detections above the upper 95% prediction interval. We aggregate these
excess detections across the three month period, and then divide the result by the aggregate of the three upper 95% prediction
intervals. Our measure, therefore, represents the relative excess of drug detections at each location.

Results
The aggregate drug offence detection rates for Brisbane show a considerable spike in May 2020 (Figure 1). Although not
as high, drug offence detections in June were among the highest since 2016 and certainly higher than the average detection
rate of the past two years. Suffice it to say that, coinciding with the introduction of the COVID-19 stay-at-home and social
distancing regulations, Brisbane experienced a unprecedented increase in drug offence detections, recording the single greatest
month-to-month increase (April to May) and resulting in the highest per-capita rate on record (May).
To answer our first question, Figure 4 maps SA2 locations in the Brisbane LGA where, for at least one month, the drug offence
detection rate was statistically higher than predicted. Overall, this was the case for 78 of 128 SA2s. Generally, the spatial
pattern appears widespread and diffuse, with a slight tendency to the inner-city and to the suburbs north of the Brisbane River.
Importantly, the overall increase in drug offence detections in Brisbane was not heavily concentrated in a small number of areas
and was not singularly the result of some disproportionate police targeting in just a few SA2s.

Of the 78 locations where drug offence detections were significantly higher than predicted, the majority were above the prediction for just one of the three months of the lockdown period (predominately the month of May) (Figure 4). This confirms that
for most places in the city the increase did not occur until after the first month of lockdown (likely after restrictions were eased
somewhat), and was a relatively temporary phenomenon.
Elsewhere, however, drug offence detections were statistically above the prediction for two (n=8) or three months (n=5, Figure
5). With two exceptions, these locations were all on the northern side of the Brisbane River. Geographically, there were two
6

main clusters, one running south west of the CBD, along the riverside, and the other in the central north. Of particular note are
the five locations where drug offence detection rates were statistically higher than predicted in all three months of the lockdown.
Two of these locations were in the inner-city, one was to the far-south west, and the remaining two were in the central northern
suburbs.

The final dimension of our analysis explored the relative size of the increase in drug offence detections, dividing the number
of excess offences by the upper 95% confidence interval to yield an estimate of the percentage increase over the three months
of the COVID-19 lockdown. By this measure, an increase of 100% (or more) indicates that the number of excess offences was
at least double the three-month prediction. In other words, for an SA2 where the upper confidence interval of predicted drug
offence detection rate was 30, the relative increase would be 20% if the actual number of offences was 36 (6 excess offences).
Similarly, the relative increase would be 50% if the actual number of offences was 45 (15 excess offences), and 100% if the
actual number of offences was 60 (30 excess offences). Figure 6 maps the spatial distribution of these data, showing that in all
but eight SA2s, the relative increase in drug offence detections was between 1% and 50%. Seven locations recorded a relative
increase of greater than 50% (but less than 100%), while in one location the number of excess offences exceeded the prediction
by more than double. This one location is of particular interest in that its experience was inconsistent with the vast majority of
other SA2s.
To this point we have classified locations based on two different criteria: how long the increase in drug offence detections was
sustained, and how large the increase was, relative to the local prediction. We end this analysis with a geospatial depiction
(Figure 7) of their cross-classification. Here, we identify four categories of change. The largest in number are those SA2s that

increased for one month only and where the increase was relatively modest (<50%,‘likely incidental’). The second largest in
number are those SA2s which experienced an increase in drug offence detections across multiple months, but where the overall
quantum of the increase during COVID-19 was, again, relatively modest. We believe that drug detections in these areas (the
vast majority of areas across the city) are likely to have accumulated as incidental to other street-based COVID-19 policing
activities.
Five locations emerged as having an unusually high rate of drug offence detection. We think that these five locations are places
in the Brisbane LGA where there may have been a concerted and focused effort to police drug-related activities.

Discussion
Several studies have now documented a significant increase in drug offence detections during the lockdown associated with
COVID-19 (see, for example, Langfield et al., 2021), although none have documented their geospatial distribution. Knowing
where drug offence detections increased in a city, for how long, and by how much, will likely be important lines of inquiry
because different geospatial patterns may shed light on different mechanisms of change. In this study, we rise to the challenge
with a comparison of actual and predicted drug offence detection rates across 128 statistical local areas of the Brisbane LGA in
Queensland, Australia.
We found strong evidence that the increase in drug offence detections was geospatially diffuse and not specific or disproportionate to a small number of urban centres or townships. This is an important finding which suggests that underlying the increase

was a general upward shift in detection rates, rather than extreme increases in a small number of locations, of the likes one
might expect from a highly targeted drug market interdiction operation. That said, we did find a small number (five in total)
of unusual results where extreme values were recorded. For one of these locations, the drug offence detection rate throughout
April-June was more than double the worst case prediction and resulted from a sustained increase over multiple months. In
light of what happened across the rest of the city, it is hard to imagine that these locations were not the target of some unusually
intensive policing activity, possibly even specifically directed at drug user communities.
In sum, we think that in most places across Brisbane drug users and drug sellers became increasingly visible and vulnerable to
detection, although we credit this to a number of competing and intersecting mechanisms. First, we know that police are likely
to have had more time to dedicate to street-based operational activities since all other crime types were in considerable decline
(Langfield et al., 2021; Payne et al., 2020) and since policing priorities during COVID-19 were focused on public health and
regulatory compliance (Maskály et al., 2021). This will have likely increased police attention on unusual or suspicious conduct,
thus increasing the frequency of direct contact between the police and those members of the community who were not staying
at home as directed.
Second, we expect that stay-at-home orders will have reduced pedestrian activity across the city, in particular the inner-city
where daily foot traffic is usually high. Whereas busy streets likely provide some coverage and protection for drug market
transactions (see, for example, Haracopos and Hough, 2005 and May and Hough, 2004), this protection is likely to have
diminished during COVID-19 as large segments of the population avoided public spaces and went out for essential activities
only (see Stickle and Felson, 2020 and also Murphy et al., 2020 for an analysis of the COVID-19 public health order compliance
rates). No longer were drug transactions able to be covertly hidden within the hustle and bustle of everyday urban life. Instead
9

A PREPRINT - M AY 2021

they were increasingly overt enterprises that came with an increased risk of being watched or seen. To be sure, others have
indicated a COVID-19-related shift to the more frequent use of ‘home delivery’ and ‘take away’ style transactions (see Namli,
2021 and Eligh, 2020), but still this will have required at least one party to travel away from home for non-essential reasons.
Third, we hypothesise that many areas will have benefited from an increase in capable guardianship because large segments of
the community stayed home more often and for longer throughout the day. Although passive surveillance and neighbourhood
guardianship is normally linked to lower levels of crime (Hollis-Peel et al., 2011), we think the reverse is true for drug offences
during COVID-19. Specifically, we think it is likely that some ‘excess’ drug offence detections occurred in suburban SA2s
because the residents, now working or staying at home during the day, more often identified suspicious behaviour and this may
have resulted in more ‘concerned citizens’ reports to the police (for a discussion on the public’s willingness to report COVID-19
breaches see Sargeant et al., 2021).5
Finally, while this might not explain the increase overall, we cannot discount the vulnerability and visibility that might have been
caused by the displacement of drug transactions from the once busy city streets to the suburbs and urban backstreets. Although
it might be an act of detection evasion, it is possible that spatial displacement may have actually increased the visibility of drug
transactions because buyers and sellers were forced to traverse unfamiliar terrain and take greater risks in an effort to transact.
If nothing else, this displacement will have likely piqued the interest of concerned citizens as the extra and unusual traffic of
unfamiliar vehicles and people in their street or neighbourhood became a cause to call the police.
Of course, there are a number of important limitations which should be considered in light of our findings. In particular, we
model police drug offence detection data which combined drug possession, drug trafficking and other drug offences, including
the possession of drug utensils and paraphernalia. It would have been preferable had we been able to disaggregate these offence
types into separate models, but alas, to do that would have required a much more coarse geographical resolution that would
have impeded the spatio-temporal analysis. Further, we also note that drug offence detection data are likely to be a relatively
poor proxy for drug market activity as they speak only to a very small fraction of the overall activity across a city. With most
detections being for possession (rather than trafficking) it is likely that our measure speaks mostly to the detection of drug users
after purchase, but how long after and in what proximity to the site of purchase is unknown. Finally, our predictions are based
on a complex spatiotemporal model which performs surprisingly well (accounts for 85% of the variance), but is not without its
limitations. Like all models, our GAM is a mathematical representation of the processes underlying the data, where statistical
relationships (both between locations and within locations over time) are averaged. Models are imperfect and their imprecisions
can have implications for the statistical changes we have witnessed in these results. To be sure, we have tried to manage this risk
using Bayesian simulations to compute prediction intervals and by focussing mostly on areas where the increase was sustained
or relatively extreme. Still, readers are always reminded that a model with different parameters can yield different results.
To conclude, we are reminded that the COVID-19 effect on crime is best summarised as a fundamental transformation of social
and routine activities caused by government mandated lockdowns. As others have noted (Stickle and Felson, 2020), the COVID19 lockdown period represents an almost natural and unanticipated social experiment, and it is the view of these results that
we ask a number of important questions that should inspire others to find answers in further research. Specifically, we wonder
what the COVID-19 lockdown may have revealed about previously unknown drug markets. If it is true that drug users became
more visible to the police and concerned residents, to what extent might this brief period of intensive focus have revealed things
not previously known to the police? We also wonder to what extent the lockdown may have caused the displacement of market
transactions into urban areas not previously affected? Will these new markets wither again as the pandemic subsides, or will
they take hold and prosper? And, finally, what deterrent impact will the short-term increase in detection probabilities during the
lockdown have on drug users–will the pandemic have heightened their perceived risk of apprehension and how long might such
a change in perception last? Answering these questions will be important for not only understanding what happened, when,
and where, but also the more important question of why.

Other research conducted by McCarthy et al., 2021 and Murphy et al., 2020 has shown that, at least in Australia, a large proportion of
individuals did not fully abide by or follow the public health orders in the early months of the pandemic. These researchers found that defiant
individuals, and those who had been subjected to, or witnessed police-initiated encounters they deemed to be ‘procedurally unjust’ were less
likely to comply with the public health orders.
