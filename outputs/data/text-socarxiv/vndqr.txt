Abstract
Authoritative economic growth forecasts are often optimistically biased. Negatively skewed variation–negative shocks being larger than positive shocks–could contribute to bias by making long-run average growth
smaller than typical-year (median) growth. This positively biases forecasts based on typical years. We compare medians and means in real
per-capita GDP growth across countries, regions, and time windows from
1820-2016. Over decadal periods, we find mean growth rates <1%/y
smaller than median growth rates in most countries and regions (median
0.23%/y across countries). Surprisingly, we find both large- and mediummagnitude shocks contribute to these differences, rather than only large
‘black swan’ events. We find negative skewness correlated with high levels
and slow growth of per-capita GDP and population, and high per-capita
GDP growth volatility, building on previous studies. We find negative
skewness alone insufficient to explain recent growth over-projections by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

Introduction

Authoritative economic forecasts–such as International Monetary Fund (IMF) World
Economic Outlook (WEO) (IMF, 2020) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
U.S. forecasts (CBO, 2020a)–are critical to multiple facets of research and policymaking, and are often positively biased, especially on longer-horizons (>3 years ahead)
(Timmermann, 2007; De Resende, 2014; CBO, 2019). Economic forecast biases can
collaterally bias projections of other policy-relevant factors, such as public deficits
(Blanchard & Leigh, 2013; CBO, 2019) and greenhouse-gas emissions (Le Quéré et al.,
2020; Burgess et al., 2021).
The COVID-19 pandemic illustrates one possible reason for positive economic forecast bias: large, unexpected shocks–by definition difficult to predict (Taleb, 2007)–are
often negative. If negative shocks are larger than positive shocks, the distribution
of economic growth rates is negatively skewed (also called left-skewed), making longrun average (mean) growth rates smaller than typical-year (median or mode) growth
rates, and positively biasing forecasts based on typical years. Rational forecasters
would project the median of their uncertainty as a point estimate if their objective
was to minimize mean absolute forecast error; in this case, their average bias would
equal the difference between mean and median if uncertainty was accurately estimated
(Gu & Wu, 2003; Gneiting, 2011). (In contrast, forecasting the mean of uncertainty
minimizes mean squared error (Gneiting, 2011).) Negative skewness can also positively bias economic forecasts if tail risks are challenging or impossible to estimate
accurately (e.g., Müller & Watson (2016); Adrian et al. (2019)).
Several studies have found negative skewness in economic growth and related quantities. Bekaert & Popov (2019) found negatively skewed economic growth–measured by
the Fisher–Pearson coefficient of skewness (hereafter ‘Pearson skewness’)–widespread
across a sample of 110 countries post-1960, with greater negative skewness being associated with greater volatility in richer countries. Popov (2014) found negatively
skewed economic growth associated with financial openness in post-1970 developing
countries. Salgado et al. (2019) found negatively skewed productivity, sales, and employment growth during recessions across fifty countries. Adrian et al. (2019) found
left-tail risk was the predominant driver of U.S. growth volatility since the 1970s. Other
studies have either documented business-cycle skewness (Diebold & Rudebusch, 1990;
Acemoglu & Scott, 1994; Müller & Watson, 2016), or predicted it in models (Zeira,
1994; Acemoglu & Scott, 1997; Bekaert & Engstrom, 2017). Gu & Wu (2003) found
corporate earnings are often negatively skewed, with implications for investment risk.
Here, we provide two contributions. First, we characterize patterns of skewness in
the annual variation of real per-capita GDP growth, across 169 countries and seven
regions since the Industrial Revolution (1820-2016) (data from Bolt et al. (2018); Roser
(2020)). In contrast to previous studies (e.g., Bekaert & Popov (2019)), we measure
skewness as the difference between mean and median growth rates (either raw, or
normalized to medium-to-long-term trends). This measure has a direct theoretical
link to expected forecast bias when minimizing mean absolute error (Gu & Wu, 2003),
and, as we show, is only moderately correlated with Pearson skewness in country-level
growth data. Our research questions are: (i) How pervasive and large in magnitude
is skewness, by this measure? (ii) How important are ‘black-swan’ (i.e. rare and
major (Taleb, 2007)) events in driving overall skewness? (iii) How does skewness vary
temporally and regionally? Second, we compare this measure of skewness to recent
forecast errors by the IMF WEO (2004-2019) and the CBO (1982-2019), to explore
links between skewness and biases.

While our analysis has implications for macroeconomics, our intended target audience is broader, including all who use economic growth forecasts in their research.
Many such researchers may not be aware of forecast biases or negatively skewed economic growth patterns. Relating differences between mean and median growth rates
to forecast biases is also applicable to other types of forecasts (Gu & Wu, 2003). Moreover, skewness likely biases forecasts in other contexts. For instance, Anderson et al.
(2017) found negatively skewed population growth patterns likely cause underestimation of endangered species extinction risk.

Measuring skewness

We use a continuous measure of annual economic growth (see Appendix A for details
regarding data processing). Per-capita GDP growth in year t in country or region i,
denoted gi,t is defined as:
gi,t = 100[ln(p.c.GDPi,t ) − ln(p.c.GDPi,t−1 )]

(1)

Using a continuous measure makes the multi-year total growth rate equal to the
sum of the annual growth rates, and multi-year average growth equal to the arithmetic
mean of annual growth rates. We analyze real per-capita GDP growth in purchasingpower parity (PPP) units, except where otherwise indicated (e.g., in section 5).
In order to explore short-term deviations from longer-term trends, we normalize
growth rates relative to 11-year moving medians. The normalized growth rate of
country or region i in year t, denoted di,t , is calculated as:
di,t = gi,t − med(gi,t−5 , ..., gi,t+5 ).

(2)

For instance, di,t for 1995 is the growth rate in 1995 minus the median annual
growth rate from 1990-2000. Our results are qualitatively robust to using alternate
moving-window sizes (5 years and 21 years) as well as not normalizing, as we show in
Appendix B.

Patterns of skewness

Fig. 1A shows the difference between mean and median di,t for each country, calculated
across all available data from 1820-2016 (Bolt et al., 2018; Roser, 2020). The longest
time series in our analysis is 197 years (1820-2016; e.g., Denmark, Sweden, United
Kingdom). The shortest is 24 years (1993-2016; United Arab Emirates). Roughly half
of the countries (88/169) have data beginning between 1950-1952 and ending in 2016;
and roughly one third (58/169) have longer time series than this.
Mean(di,t ) − med(di,t ) <(>) 0 implies negative (positive) skewness. Two-thirds of
the countries (108/169) in our dataset show negatively skewed growth–the rest positive
(median −0.23%/y). The absolute value of mean(di,t ) − med(di,t ) was less than 1 for
most countries (85 out of 108 showing negative skewness; 57 out of 61 showing positive
skewness). Many countries exhibiting positive skewness are in Africa or western Asia
(Fig. 1C, Fig. 2B). These patterns are robust to: variations in moving-window size,
not normalizing growth rates (Figs. B1-B5), and measuring skewness using Pearson
skewness (Fig. B2). However, Pearson skewness is only moderately correlated with
Mean(di,t ) − med(di,t ) (0.43 < r < 0.58, varying by moving-window size; Fig. B2).

balanced panels of countries. (C) Time series of moving mean − moving median per-capita GDP
growth in each of seven regions and the world as a whole. Data from Bolt et al. (2018); Roser
(2020).

Global patterns of skewness have been fairly stable since the early 1900s (data are
too sparse to draw pre-1900 conclusions) (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1B shows trends of moving
mean − moving median per-capita GDP growth (11-year windows) over time in two
balanced panels (i.e. all countries included have data for all years)–one from 19012016 (“long”, 38 countries–largely developed), the other from 1952-2016 (“short”, 134
countries). Both time series show similar central tendencies–the 50th percentiles of
moving mean − moving median per-capita GDP growth mostly vary between 0 and
−0.5%/y, and show greater negative skewness just before World War II and during
the fall of the Soviet Union (Fig. 1B,C). There is greater cross-country variation in
skewness in the short panel and when using shorter moving windows (Fig. 1B,C, Figs.
B3, B4).
Surprisingly, we find skewness is driven by both large and medium-sized (both
rare and common) shocks, rather than being driven only by large ‘black swan’ (Taleb,
2007) events. To visualize this result, Fig. 2 compares mean(di,t ) − med(di,t ), across
countries (Fig. 2A) and regions (Fig. 2B), using different fractions of the data, moving
outward from the median (e.g., “% of distribution included” = 50%, means that only
the 25th-75th percentile range, in di,t , is included). If skewness in economic growth was
being driven solely by rare (once-in-a-decade or rarer) events, then we would expect
to see the points in Fig. 2 cluster around zero until the percentage of the distribution
included was large, at which point we would see an abrupt decrease (if skewness was
negative). Instead, we mostly see smooth curves, often with one third or more of
the distribution (i.e. one-in-three-year shocks) contributing to the skewness. Smaller
shocks contribute more to skewness, on average, in regions (Fig. 2B) than countries
(Fig. 2A), possibly because large shocks occurring in subsets of countries appear as

small shocks regionally. These patterns are also robust to varying moving-window
sizes (Figs. B1-B5).
In Fig. 3 and in Appendix B, we use cross-sectional and panel regressions to examine partial correlations between our measure of skewness (mean(di,t ) − med(di,t ))
and: per-capita GDP levels and growth rates, population levels and growth rates,
volatility (measured as the s.d. of per-capita GDP growth rates, following Bekaert
& Popov (2019)), and interactions between these variables. In contrast to Bekaert
& Popov (2019), we find a weakly negative cross-sectional correlation between skewness and volatility–a difference owing to additional countries and years included in
our dataset with high volatility and negative skewness (e.g., Iraq, Lenanon, Libya,
Liberia; the Arab Spring) (Fig. B6). This negative correlation is strengthened when
controlling for other variables (Fig. 3, Tables B1, B2). We also find negative skewness
associated with: larger population and per-capita GDP, and slower per-capita GDP
growth and population growth (Fig. 3). We find significant interactions–consistently
across alternate panel and cross-sectional model specifications–between: per-capita
GDP growth and volatility (positive; i.e. volatility is associated with more positive
skewness in faster-growing countries), and per-capita GDP growth and population
(negative; greater per-capita GDP growth is associated with more positive skewness

in smaller countries) (Tables B1, B2).

Skewness and IMF forecast errors

The IMF WEO economic forecasts vary in their methods across regional teams, using
combinations of structural models (e.g. production functions), statistical analyses,
and expert judgment (De Resende, 2014). They consider a range of factors, including
policies, structural and business cycle conditions, and accounting identities between
key variables (De Resende, 2014). Regional teams coordinate to ensure consistency,
especially for short-term forecasts (1-2 years ahead) (De Resende, 2014). Mediumterm forecasts (3-5 years ahead) often assume GDP will converge to potential GDP
(the maximum output an economy can produce without increasing inflation (OECD,
2017)). Previous assessments (Timmermann, 2007; De Resende, 2014) identified this
assumption as contributing to optimistic forecast errors, along with forecasters’ inabilities to predict recessions (Timmermann, 2007; De Resende, 2014), and optimistic
bias in countries participating in IMF programs (De Resende, 2014) or receiving IMF
credit (Aldenhoff, 2007). IMF forecast methods’ heterogeneity complicates a priori
assessments of whether they account for skewness, but poorly forecasting shocks could
link skewness to bias.
Since the Great Recession of 2008-2009, the IMF WEO has over-projected growth
globally and regionally (Fig. 4A). IMF forecasts were consistently more optimistic
the farther ahead projections were (Fig. 4A, Fig. B7). In contrast, one-year-ahead
IMF forecasts consistently under-projected per-capita GDP growth before the Great
Recession (2004-2007) (projections multiple years ahead were not available pre-2008).
We find similar patterns at the country level (Fig. B7).
IMF projections heavily influence scenarios used in climate change research, such

(A) Comparison of per-capita GDP growth rates: observed (light grey), 11-year moving
mean (black) and median (red), and projected by the IMF World Economic Outlook (blue) and the
“middle of the road” Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenario (SSP2) (Dellink et al., 2017) (purple,
dashed). We show only SSP2 (among the SSPs) because economic growth forecasts of all SSPs
are similar over this time period, due to their basis in IMF and OECD forecasts (Dellink et al.,
2017; Riahi et al., 2017). Projections are shown according to the year of the projection (e.g. a 5-y
projection for 2015 is 2015 growth projected in 2010). Panels B and C show correlations between
mean IMF projection errors in per-capita GDP growth (2004-2019 in B; 2011-2019 in C) and the
difference between mean and median per-capita GDP growth over the same period. Each point
represents one country (n = 164 in B, n = 175 in C). OLS fits, including an intercept, are shown
(red lines). Negative slopes are statistically significant, with p < 0.001, in both panels. Positive
intercept is statistically significant in panel C only, with p < 0.001. Panel D shows correlation
between di,t (observed growth − 11-y moving median growth) and IMF growth projection errors,
on different forecast horizons. Lines represent OLS fits. Negative slopes are statistically significant
(p < 0.001) in all forecast horizons and have magnitudes very close to −1 (Figs. B8, B9, Table
B3). The intercept was negative on a 1-y horizon, positive on all other horizons, and statistically
significant (p < 0.001) in all horizons.

as the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios (Dellink et al., 2017; Riahi
et al., 2017). Fig. 4A shows how projected growth in the “middle of the road” SSP
scenario (SSP2) has overshot observed growth by magnitudes similar to IMF mediumterm forecasts. Other scenarios assume similar growth rates pre-2020 (Dellink et al.,
2017), and have consequently over-projected growth by similar magnitudes (Burgess
et al., 2021).
The strongest evidence for a role of skewness in IMF forecast errors comes from
the fact that the difference between observed and moving median growth (i.e. di,t
explains most of the variance (R2 ≥ 0.75) in IMF forecast errors, in each forecast
horizon, with a nearly 1:1 correlation between the magnitudes of di,t and the forecast
error. (Fig. 4D). This suggests–not surprisingly–that IMF forecast errors are strongly
correlated with the magnitude of shocks–a correlation with potential to introduce longrun bias via skewness. Indeed, we see a modest negative correlation between mean

7

forecast errors and skewness across countries (R2 = 0.13 on a three-year horizon) (Fig.
4B,C). This correlation is slightly weaker when using Pearson skewness instead of the
difference between mean and median growth (Fig. B10).
However, we also see clear evidence that skewness is insufficient to explain the
IMF’s forecast errors. The IMF’s post-2009 medium-term forecast errors (3-5 years
ahead) are substantially larger than can be solely explained by negatively skewed
growth variation. Their projections consistently exceed moving medians in all regions
(Fig. 4A), with similar country-level patterns (Fig. 4C,D, Fig. B7). Across countries,
the 50th percentile of mean (across years) medium-term forecast errors ranged from
0.91%/y (3 years ahead) to 1.33%/y (5 years ahead)–much larger in absolute value
than both the typical range of mean(di,t ) − med(di,t )) (−0.5%/y to 0%/y) and the
50th percentile of mean - median per-capita GDP growth from 2011-2019 (the years
corresponding to medium-term projections) (−0.056%/y). We can also see evidence
for effects on forecast errors, additional to skewness, in statistically significant and
positive intercept terms–on two-to-five-year forecast horizons–in OLS regressions of
forecast error on di,t (Fig. 4). The fact that other factors beyond skewness contribute
to forecast errors is not surprising, given the other sources of error noted by previous
studies (Aldenhoff, 2007; Timmermann, 2007; De Resende, 2014).
We find a slight time trend in IMF’s forecast errors. One-year-ahead forecasts
became more optimistic over time–before and after the Great Recession (Figs. B8,
B9)–while 2-5-year-ahead forecasts became slightly less optimistic over time (Table
B3).

Skewness and CBO forecast errors

The CBO’s U.S. economic growth forecasts also use a combination of statistical and
structural modeling (CBO, 2019, 2020b), and aim to account for possible negative
skewness in two ways. First, they report forecasts which are means (rather than the
median or mode) of estimated outcome distributions (CBO, 2020b). However, this
only accounts for skewness in practice if the outcome distributions–especially downside
risks–are accurately estimated. Second, the CBO assumes a persistent negative output
gap (i.e. difference between actual and potential GDP) of 0.5% based on historical
output gaps between the 1950s and the 2000s (CBO, 2020b). This would account
for negative skewness in growth to the extent that average output gaps measure past
skewness and predict future skewness. The CBO identifies the following factors as
contributing to forecast errors (CBO, 2019): unpredictability of growth in and around
recessions, shifts in labor productivity trends (e.g., increasing during the late ‘90s,
decreasing post-2006), changes in oil prices, declining interest rates, declining labor
compensation relative to GDP, and data revisions. Of these, recessions are most
related to negatively skewed growth patterns.
We see two patterns in CBO forecast errors (1980s-2010s) which are similar to the
IMF. First, much of the error owes to failing to project or under-projecting shocks
(Figs. 5D, B11, Table B4), which may suggest that negative skewness contributes
to positive bias (though a cross-sectional comparison–analogous to Fig. 4B,C–cannot
be done in the CBO data, as they come from a single country). As with the IMF’s
errors, CBO’s growth projection errors had a nearly 1:1 correlation with the difference
between observed growth and its 11-y moving median, di,t (slope of this relationship
was between −0.85 and −0.92 in 2-y-to 6-y-ahead forecasts; Fig. 5D).
Second, medium-term (3-6-year) forecasts are more optimistic than short-term

observed (light grey), 11-year moving mean (black) and median (red), and CBO projections (blue).
Projections are again shown according to the year projected (e.g. a 6-y projection for 2015 indicates
2015 growth projected in 2009). Panel B shows nominal growth projection errors on various timeframes. Boxes represent 25th-75th percentile (among years); whiskers represent min to max. The red

instead of real per-capita growth) using 5-y, 11-y, and 21-y windows. Panel C compares projection
errors in nominal GDP or GNP to projection errors in federal revenue, both as a percentage of the
eventually-observed value. Panel D compares growth projection errors to di,t values (analogous to
Fig. 4D). Lines in C and D indicate linear OLS fits (p < 0.001 for all slopes in D; p < 0.01 for all
slopes except 1-y ahead in C; p < 0.05 for all intercepts in D except 2-y ahead (and for none in

errors from the CBO, the OMB, and the Blue Chip consensus, from the 1980s to the mid-2010s (see
table 1 in CBO (2019)). The red dashed line represents the median - mean real GDP growth from
1979-2016. The pink shaded region represents the range of med(di,t ) − mean(di,t ) (using real GDP
growth instead of real per-capita GDP growth) using 5-y, 11-y, and 21-y windows.

(1-2-year) forecasts (Fig. 5A,B,D,E). Short-term growth forecasts have not been consistently optimistic (Fig. 5A,E, B11; CBO (2019, 2020a)), whereas medium-term
forecasts have been optimistic in all periods except the late 1990s (dot-com boom)
and the early 2000s (housing boom) (Fig. 5A,B). Other forecasts of U.S. growth show
similar patterns–Fig. 5E shows CBO’s comparison of their own forecast errors to those
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Blue Chip consensus (CBO,
2019).
Although skewness may play a role in CBO forecast errors, we find evidence–
similarly to the IMF case–that skewness is insufficient to explain the errors, and thus
additional factors must also contribute (see CBO (2019)). CBO’s medium-term nominal growth forecast errors (50th percentiles range from 0.57%/y in 3-year forecasts
to 0.81%/y in 6-year forecasts) are larger in absolute value than differences between
mean and median nominal growth rates and di,t values (−0.16%/y, across the time
series) (Fig. 5A,B). Indeed, we find positive and significant intercept terms in OLS
regressions of forecast error on di,t (Fig. 5D).
Some of the CBO’s medium-term over-projection of nominal growth owes to overprojecting inflation (Fig. 5E), which is not strongly correlated with growth overprojections (see figures 3 and 5 in CBO (2019)), and thus not clearly linked to skewness.
CBO’s 5-year real GDP growth forecast errors are similar in magnitude (mean 0.2%/y
(CBO, 2019)) to differences between mean and median real growth rates or di,t values
(Fig. 5E). Interestingly, OMB’s optimistic biases have been larger than CBO’s by a
magnitude similar to our measures of negative skewness (mean − median growth).
This may be noteworthy given CBO’s assumptions intending to account for negative
skewness–namely, forecasting the mean of estimated uncertainty (e.g., the Federal
Reserve uses the mode instead (CBO, 2019)), and assuming persistent output gaps
(CBO, 2020c). However, the fact that CBO’s short-term forecasts have not been
systematically optimistic may suggest other factors besides skewness play key roles in
optimistic medium-term bias (e.g., recently declining productivity growth; see Gordon
(2016); CBO (2019)).
Growth forecast errors have important fiscal implications (e.g., Blanchard & Leigh
(2013)). For instance, as we show in Fig. 5C, CBO’s forecast errors of U.S. GDP have
been strongly correlated with their forecast errors of federal revenue–each 1% GDP
forecast over-(under-) projection approximately corresponds to a 2% revenue forecast
over-(under-) projection. Before the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, the CBO forecasted
U.S. federal debt would reach 180% of GDP by 2050 (CBO, 2020a), but it could be
higher if GDP remains below its currently forecasted trajectory (Gordon (2016) also
notes this possibility).

Discussion

The COVID-19 crisis has drawn attention to negatively skewed economic growth
variation–negative shocks often having larger magnitudes than positive shocks. We
explored regional and temporal patterns and extent of negative skewness in per-capita
GDP growth since the Industrial Revolution (1820-2016), and its possible links to
optimistically biased forecasts by authoritative sources widely used in economic and
environmental research and policy: the IMF, the SSPs, and the CBO.
We used an intuitive measure of economic growth skewness–comparing average
growth rates with typical (median) growth rates. This measure provides a theoretically grounded link between skewness and potential forecast bias: Rational forecasters

10

minimizing mean absolute forecast error and accurately estimating the outcome distribution would forecast the median (Gu & Wu, 2003; Gneiting, 2011) and thus be
biased by our measure of skewness (mean − median) on average.
We found negatively skewed economic growth variation is widespread but not universal (Fig. 1), and, surprisingly, is driven by both rare and common (e.g., one-inthree-year) shocks (Fig. 2), rather than being driven predominantly by rare shocks
(black swans).
Our measure of negative skewness is correlated with: slow average per-capita GDP
and population growth, high per-capita GDP growth volatility, and high per-capita
GDP and population, within and across countries (Figs. 3, B6, Tables B1, B2). This
is consistent with the finding of Bekaert & Popov (2019) that volatility is associated
with more negative skewness in richer countries (and their related hypotheses), even
though we did not find the positive correlation they report in cross-sectional data
(Fig. B6). Analogously, larger companies have more negatively skewed returns than
smaller companies (Harvey & Siddique, 2000). These patterns are intuitive: larger
entities have larger left-tail risk (farther to fall) than right-tail risk (e.g., because of
diminishing returns).
Our results were qualitatively consistent when using raw growth rates or normalizing to 5-, 11-, or 21-year moving medians. Our measures of skewness within countries
or regions were typically also quantitatively similar in individual regions or countries,
except in cases with longer-period fluctuations in growth (e.g., several consecutive
years of rapid decline followed by several consecutive years of rapid growth) which
contributed to skewness in raw growth but not normalized growth, di,t (e.g., see Western Asia in Fig. B5). Comparing skewness across different dynamic frequencies was
beyond the scope of our analysis but merits further study (e.g., Müller & Watson
(2016)).
Our analysis suggests that negatively skewed growth plausibly contributes to optimistic biases in IMF and CBO projections, but is insufficient to explain these biases
alone, and thus other factors must also contribute.
We find evidence for a role of negative skewness in bias in: (i) the strong correlation
between forecast errors and deviations from moving median growth, in both the IMF
(Fig. 4D) and CBO (Fig. 5D) data; and (ii) the modest negative correlation between
mean − median growth (i.e. skewness) and the mean IMF projection error across
countries (Fig. 4B,C). The fact that the OMB’s optimistic forecast bias has been
greater than the CBO’s may also be suggestive of a role of skewness in forecast bias,
given that the CBO takes additional steps to account for skewness (CBO, 2019, 2020c).
However, this hypothesis merits further scrutiny.
Other factors also contribute to these optimistic forecast biases. In our analysis,
we see this in medium-term (3-6-year) biases being larger than differences between
mean and median growth rates (Fig. 4A,C, Fig. 5A,B), and in larger optimistic
biases in medium-term forecasts than in short-term (1-2-year) forecasts. For example,
GDP failing to converge to potential GDP over the medium term could be partly
caused by skewness, but could also be caused by inaccurate estimates of potential
GDP (De Resende, 2014), or potential GDP being more of an upper bound than an
average throughout the business cycle (i.e., the ’Plucking model’ (Friedman, 1993)–see
Dupraz et al. (2019)).
Political factors may also contribute to optimistic growth forecast biases. IMF
forecasters may have incentive to forecast large effects of IMF programs (De Resende,
2014), or assume continuing progress towards international development goals (e.g.,
as the SSPs assume (Riahi et al., 2017)), including high sustained economic growth

11

in developing regions and per-capita GDP convergence between rich and poor countries. Incumbent national governments may benefit politically from optimistic economic growth projections (higher growth benefits incumbents (Feng, 1997)). This
may contribute to the OMB (managed by the White House) having greater optimistic
forecast bias than the CBO (CBO, 2019) (Krause & Corder (2007) found analogous
patterns). Fear of self-fulfilling recession predictions may also positively bias forecasters (De Resende, 2014).
Optimistically biased growth forecasts may also signal that the economic headwinds projected by most economists to slow 21st-century growth in most regions (e.g.,
see ranges of projections in Christensen et al. (2018); Dellink et al. (2017); Müller et al.
(2019); Startz (2020)) are more severe than some anticipated. Headwinds include aging populations, debt, some drivers of productivity growth (e.g. education) naturally
plateauing, and middle-income countries completing their rapid industrializations (see,
e.g. Gordon (2016)). Some scholars foresee innovation slowdowns (relative to the 20th
century) (Gordon, 2016), climate change (Woodard et al., 2019), and/or accelerating
declines in birth rates (Bricker & Ibbitson, 2019; Jones, 2020; Vollset et al., 2020)
further depressing 21st-century growth. The IMF’s and CBO’s successive downward
revisions of post-2008 growth forecasts (Fig. 4, 5) are consistent with this narrative,
and with the CBO’s finding that declining productivity growth has contributed to its
forecast errors (CBO, 2019). However, this hypothesis also merits further scrutiny.
Finally, economic forecasting is simply difficult, especially on longer horizons, as
small errors and uncertainties compound (Morgan, 2018). The economy is a highly
complex system, with uncertainties in the future evolution of each element (e.g. technology, trade, inequality, policies, the financial system). This may be why, for instance, Rossi & Sekhposyan (2010) found that many traditional economic indicators
(e.g., price indices, unemployment, Federal Reserve interest rates) have lost much of
their predictive power regarding output growth since the mid 1980s. On the other
hand, finding systematic biases in forecasts–such as those discussed here–might be
conducive to improving them. Systematic bias may be easier to correct for than imprecision. One simple approach to reducing mean bias would be to materially reward
forecasters based on success at minimizing squared errors (Gneiting, 2011).
Regardless of the reasons, positive biases in authoritative economic forecasts have
important implications for research and policy. For instance, fiscal outlooks using
optimistic economic forecasts are likely also optimistic (Fig. 5C)–at a time when public debt outlooks concern many economists (e.g., Reinhart et al. (2012); but see also
Blanchard (2019)), and large-scale investments in infrastructure are needed to combat climate change. In climate change research, over-projections of economic growth
might lead to overly pessimistic projections of 21st-century emissions (Burgess et al.,
2021), but overly optimistic outlooks regarding other climate- and growth-adjacent
societal challenges (e.g., adaptive capacity, social cohesion, conflict, inequality, and
fiscal feasibility of large-scale public investments). These considerations will magnify
if growth pessimists (e.g., Gordon (2016), and some macroeconomists surveyed by
Christensen et al. (2018)) turn out to be right about the imminence and severity of
coming worldwide economic slowdowns. Notably, the assumptions of the SSP3 scenario (‘regional rivalry’)–which imagines a world with relatively low trade and global
cooperation (Riahi et al., 2017)–seem consistent with the aftermath of the COVID-19
pandemic, which is likely to reduce near-term trade as countries place greater emphasis on secure domestic supply chains (Baldwin & di Mauro, 2020; Maliszewska et al.,
2020; Ranald et al., 2020). The possibilities of slowing growth and magnifying related
social and fiscal challenges highlight the need for institutions to consider and be robust

12

to economic stagnation.
Lastly, the fact that negatively skewed growth is both widespread and caused by
both common and rare shocks underscores the need for economic and fiscal planners
to build resilience and left-tail risk into their policies and outlooks. Indeed, left-tail
risk is an important consideration in a much wider range of policy issues (Taleb, 2007),
perhaps especially those related to the environment and sustainability (e.g., Anderson
et al. (2017); Weitzman (2009)).

Appendices
Appendix A: Data description
Our main analysis uses real per-capita GDP data (in units of 2011 USD purchasing
power parity, PPP), at the country level, from the Maddison Project (Bolt et al., 2018)
via Roser (2020). We supplement these with population data from the UN (United
Nations Population Division, 2019 (accessed June 19, 2020) and HYDE Database
(Klein Goldewijk, 2007), via Max Roser & Ortiz-Ospina (2019). For Figs. 1A,C, 2,
B1, B2, B3B, B4B, B5, and B6B, we include all annual data from 1820—meaning
some countries have longer time series. In Figs. 1B, 3, B3A, B4A, B6A, and Tables
B1 and B2, we use balanced panels (i.e. only include countries having data in all years
between the specified time periods), with time periods indicated.
For our comparisons to IMF projections, we obtain country-level projections from
the historical archive of IMF World Economic Outlook Databases (WEO) from 2003
to 2019 (IMF, 2020). We use the latest forecasts from each year when multiple are
available, and we exclude older databases (2000-2002 are available) due to the relatively small number of countries included in these earlier databases. We calculate real
per-capita GDP growth (in PPP units) using equation [1], when using real per-capita
GDP (PPP) values either directly given in the WEO reports or calculated from other
data series (e.g., GDP and population). We use country-level data in Figs. 4B,C,D,
B7-B10 and Table B3. We aggregate country-level data to IPCC regions in Fig. 4A,
using the region definitions provided by IIASA (International Institute for Applied
Systems Analysis (IIASA), 2018). SSP2 projections shown in Fig. 4A are visualized
using the procedure described in Burgess et al. (2021), using annual GDP and population projections from the SSP database (International Institute for Applied Systems
Analysis (IIASA) (2018); described in Dellink et al. (2017); Riahi et al. (2017)).
For our comparisons of U.S. growth to CBO projections (Figs. 5, B11, Table B4),
we use growth and projection data, from 1982-2019, publicly available from the CBO
(CBO, 2020a). We use nominal GDP (or GNP, pre-1992) growth (current USD) in
this analysis–rather than real per-capita GDP growth—because CBO (CBO, 2020a)
corrects for effects of new policies, enacted after the forecast, in its reporting of forecast
errors. Thus, we analyze these reported errors directly, rather than attempting to back
out inflation and population effects, which are not reported. We also calculate growth
using equation [1] from reported and projected GDP (or GNP) values.

Table B2:

Panel analysis (linear models) of partial correlations between mean − median percapita GDP growth (on 10-year intervals) and covariates. Following Bekaert & Popov (2019) (BP),
we obtain a panel by dividing the dataset into non-overlapping 10-year segments (1956-1965,..., 20062015). Volatility here refers to the standard deviation of per-capita GDP growth across the time
series. Lag refers to a one-period (10-year) lag. Models are selected as follows: Model (1): based
on BP table 4 model 2. Model (2): based on BP table 4 model 4. Model (3): based on BP table 4
model 9 (with annual data and full sample). Model (4): model with same effects as Model 5 in Table
B1 above, with no fixed effects. Model (5): model with same effects as Model 5 in Table B1 above,
with country and time-period fixed effects. Model (6): minimum AICc model with country and
time period fixed effects and 5 effects or fewer, among all possible models including the following
covariates and/or their interactions: lag(mean − median p.-c. GDP growth, %/y continuous),
log(volatility), mean(p.-c. GDP growth), mean(population growth), log(p.-c. GDP, beginning of
10-y period), log(population, beginning of 10-y period). Interaction effects are included in the model
with global means subtracted from each interacted variable. Only countries with annual data from
1956-2015 are included in this analysis (134 countries).

Figure B10:

Comparison of results shown in Fig. 4B,C–reproduced here in panels A and C–to
comparable results with Pearson skewness as a measure (panels B and D), instead of the difference
between mean and median per-capita GDP growth. Each point represents one country (n = 164
in A, B, n = 175 in C, D). OLS fits, including an intercept, are shown (red lines). Negative slopes
are statistically significant in panels A-C, with p < 0.001 in panels A and C, and p = 0.015 in
panel B (p = 0.063 in panel D). Positive intercept is statistically significant in panels C and D, with
p < 0.001.
