Spain has been one of the most affected regions by the COVID-19 worldwide, and Madrid its
most affected city. In response to this, the Spanish government enacted a strict lockdown in late
March, that was gradually eased until June. We explored differentials in mobility by area-level
deprivation in the functional area of Madrid, before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown.
We used cell phone-derived mobility indicators (% of the population leaving their area) from the
National Institute of Statistics (INE), and a composite measure of deprivation from the Spanish
Society of Epidemiology (SEE). We computed changes in mobility with respect to pre-pandemic
levels, and explored spatial patterns and associations with deprivation. We found that levels of
mobility before COVID-19 were slightly higher in areas with lower deprivation. The economic
hibernation period resulted in very strong declines in mobility, most acutely in low deprivation
areas. These differences weakened during the re-opening, and levels of mobility were similar by
deprivation once the lockdown was lifted. Given the existence of important socioeconomic
differentials in COVID-19 exposure, it is key to ensure that these interventions do not widen
existing social inequalities.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has disrupted societies worldwide to levels not seen
since the 1918 influenza pandemic. There have been at least 34 million COVID-19 cases and at
least one million deaths globally as of September 30, 2020 [1]. To mitigate its impact, an
ensemble of non-pharmaceutical interventions has been put into place, disrupting economic
and social activities worldwide [2]. One of these set of interventions, aimed at reducing contacts
between individuals, includes physical distancing [3]. These interventions include minimizing inperson work, education, and entertainment, along with restrictions to regional and
metropolitan mobility. These restrictions have had an enormous impact in the progression of
the pandemic, saving thousands of lives in many different settings [4].

Spain has been one of the countries most affected by the pandemic, with 31.000 deaths
and 748.000 cases between March and September 2020 [1]. Annual life expectancy during the
first few months of the pandemic declined by 2 years in Madrid alone, while weekly life

43

46
47
48
49

expectancy in Madrid and other regions of Spain declined by up to 10 years during the peak [5].
As part of the Spanish effort to mitigate the pandemic, lockdown measures were imposed due
to the declaration of State of Alarm published on March 14, 2020 [6], along with the declaration
of an “economic hibernation” on March 28, 2020. These efforts resulted in an 80% reduction in
public transit use [7]. As part of the re-opening strategy (called “New normality”), mobility
started increasing on May 25th, but has not reached pre-pandemic levels. For example, travel
to transit, retail, supermarkets, parks, and workplaces has remained low for Madrid [8].

Given that the main purpose of these restrictions is to avoid exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in
order to reduce the burden of infection, policies that increase mobility and forces workers to
physically get to work, or that lift restrictions too early, may increase exposure for both
individuals, that need to continue being mobile, and the entire population, that will continue
having increased incidence [9]. One of these social processes limiting the effectiveness of these
interventions is social inequality [10]. Specifically, significant sectors of the economy cannot
work remotely, especially those in essential retail, health care, public safety, and transportation,
along with janitorial and other manual workers. Most of these occupations are low-wage
occupations with very little bargaining power, and are in many cases fulfilled by migrants and
minorities [11].

To our knowledge, no previous study has systematically assessed changes in mobility by
socioeconomic status during the lockdowns associated with COVID-19. To fill this gap, we
propose to use data on small area-level socioeconomic status and daily mobility in small areas
for the metropolitan area of Madrid, Spain, one of the most affected cities worldwide.
Specifically, we propose to explore the changes in mobility patterns by area-level socioeconomic
deprivation in the metropolitan area of Madrid during the lockdown and subsequent economic
reopening. We hypothesize that geographic inequality patterns reported before COVID-19 are
exacerbated as more disadvantaged areas had higher mobility during lockdown, and that this
trend continued after the lifting of strict lockdown measures. As Spain currently undergoes a
second wave of the pandemic, we believe this analysis can help inform future mobility
restrictions to ensure health equity and better epidemic control.

We use data on all 4341 census sections (called secciones censales in Spanish) and 310
mobility areas that compose the entire metropolitan area of Madrid, Spain. We define this area
using the functional urban area definition, created by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development [12]. Almost 6 million people live in the area, where intra-urban
mobility is done by private motorized transport (37%), public transit (35%), and walking (28%)
[13]. Census sections are the smallest unit of aggregation of the Spanish census and house
around 1500 people. Mobility areas are aggregations of 3.000 and 50.000 people [14], with an
average of 19.120 inhabitants (SD=10737).

81

Mobility

82
83

We measured changes in mobility by small areas using data from the Spanish Statistical
Office (INE) [14-15]. Mobility was quantified using cell phone location data, which has been

84
85
86
87
88

shown to being more frequently and easily updatable data source to conventional travel surveys
in mobility studies [16-18]. We used this data, aggregated to mobility areas, to compute five
indicators of mobility outside of one’s mobility area of residence in five different periods
(Appendix table 1). These periods correspond to a pre-pandemic baseline, the economic
hibernation period, and the three re-opening phases.

We approximated area-level socioeconomic status using a socioeconomic deprivation
index, a common strategy in health studies quantifying socioeconomic gradients [19-23].
Specifically, we used a socioeconomic deprivation index developed by the Spanish Epidemiology
Society (Sociedad Española de Epidemiología, SEE) using data from the 2011 Spanish census.
This index included seven census indicators selected through the use of principal component
analysis. More details are available in [24], and on Appendix table 2. Since this index was
available at the census section level, we aggregated the index to the mobility area level by
averaging the value of each census section in each mobility area. We did this by conducting a
spatial join of mobility areas and census sections, as a mobility area contains one or more census
sections.

The main objective of this analysis was to study socioeconomic differentials in mobility
before, during, and after the lockdown in the metropolitan area of Madrid. We conducted this
analysis in three steps. First, we explored the distribution of mobility, both over time through
the five periods, and over space, by using choropleth maps. We also computed a summary
indicator of changes, by subtracting the mobility in each lockdown period compared to the prepandemic week. Second, we examined the association between socioeconomic deprivation and
mobility and changes in mobility by fitting a linear regression of mobility or changes in mobility
as the dependent variable and socioeconomic deprivation as the independent variable. This
study is based on bibliographic, statistical and cartographic data collected by Spanish Cadastre,
Spanish National Institute of Geographic (IGN), Spanish Epidemiology Society (SEE) and Spanish
Statistical Office (INE). Statistical analysis were conducted using R 3.6.2 [25]. Cartographical
analysis were done in QGIS 3.2.3 [26].

Table 1 shows a detailed description of the urban mobility patterns registered during
the COVID-19 pandemic in the 310 mobility areas of the Madrid metropolitan area. In the prepandemic period, an average of 36% of the population left their mobility area daily. During the
strictest lockdown, the economic hibernation period, this declined to 10%, and increased slightly
as the economy reopened, recovering to 17%, 19%, and 20% in the first and second phases and
during the complete reopening. Importantly, mobility was heterogeneous by area, with the %
leaving their mobility area daily ranging from 18 to 61% in the pre-pandemic week, and from 3%
to 16% in the economic hibernation period.

122
123
124

Figure 1 shows the change in mobility from the pre-pandemic week to the economic
hibernation stage, the most restrictive lockdown, for all mobility areas of the metropolitan area
of Madrid. We found a heterogeneous spatial pattern. First, mobility declined sharply in the

125
126
127
128
129

central districts of Madrid, where most mobility areas had a decline of mobility of more than
80%. Suburban areas were very heterogeneous, with some, especially in the North and West,
having steep drops similar to the central parts of Madrid. On the other hand, the southern part
of the city and suburban areas South of Madrid had the weakest drops in mobility, of less than
67%.

Figure 2 shows the trends in changes in mobility during the four lockdown periods,
compared to baseline, by levels of deprivation. First, we found that in the pre-pandemic period
mobility was slightly lower in more deprived areas. However, we found that mobility was
consistently higher in the same more deprived areas during all pandemic phases. We found a
78% decline in mobility during the economic hibernation period in the most deprived areas,
compared to a 74% decline in the least deprived areas. This pattern persisted during the reopening phase, although differences between areas declined over time and were negligible in
the last phase.

Figures 3 and 4 show the association between mobility and changes in mobility and
deprivation. We found that, previous to the COVID-19 pandemic, a 1 SD increase in deprivation
was associated with 0.79% lower mobility (95% CI -1.55 to -0.08). This association was reverted
during the lockdown, so that a 1 SD increase in deprivation was associated with 0.80% higher
mobility (95% CI, 0.43 to 0.98). During the re-opening, the association between deprivation and
mobility strengthened, with a 1.48 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.88) and 1.38% (95% CI 0.94 to 1.81) increase
in mobility per 1 SD increase in deprivation during Phases 1 and 2, respectively. Last, during the
full re-opening this association weakened again (B=0.86, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.38). We found that
deprivation was associated with the changes in mobility with respect to the previous normality.
Specifically, we found that a 1 SD increase in deprivation was associated with a 2.54%, 5.46%,
5.26%, and 3.78% weaker decline in mobility during the economic hibernation, phases 1 and 2,
and new normality, respectively.

Figure 5 shows the spatial co-occurrence of high/low levels of deprivation and
stronger/weaker changes in average urban mobility levels during the economic hibernation
period. We found areas of low deprivation and lower mobility in the central areas of the city and
in the Northern and Western suburbs. We also found areas of high deprivation and high mobility
in the southern areas of the city and suburbs. Appendix figures 1 and 2 show all quadrants of
mobility and deprivation.

In this study of urban mobility before, during, and after the lockdown due to COVID-19
in the metropolitan area of Madrid, we evidenced a heterogeneous mobility landscape that was
strongly socially patterned. First, we found that mobility was very low during the economic
hibernation period, with declines of up to 89% compared to baseline, and remained low during
the reopening, with declines of up to 80%, compared to baseline, in the last phase of reopening.
Second, we found that this heterogeneity was spatially patterned, with the central parts of the
city, and the northern and western suburbs, having the steepest drops in mobility. On the other
hand, the southern parts of the city and southern suburbs had the weakest drops in mobility.
This spatial pattern follows the same pattern as deprivation, that we found to be very predictive
of changes in mobility, so that more deprived areas experienced a weaker drop in mobility. This

167
168

social pattern was especially marked during Phases 1 and 2 of the re-opening, as compared to
the strictest lockdown and the full re-opening.

The Center-North-West vs South and Southeast pattern we found represents the usual
segregation pattern of the city of Madrid. Specifically, Madrid has been, since after the 19th
century, characterized by a spatial border between the rich north and the poor south that,
during the last century has been consolidated as a northeast – southeast one [27-28]. This
generalization is important to understand the factors behind the results in this manuscript, as
the ring road M30 and the A2 highway (in the Northeast) creates the main border between the
more vulnerable neighborhoods in the South, versus the rest of the central part of the city. The
segregation of Madrid has been exacerbated following the 2008 recession [29].

In the baseline week, named Previous Normality here, we observed a pattern of higher
mobility in less deprived areas. However, during the strictest part of the lockdown this pattern
was reversed, with higher mobility in more deprived areas. During this part, only people working
in essential services were allowed to even leave their home for work purposes, while everyone
else was restricted to teleworking or not working at all. Since essential workers from sectors
such as healthcare, grocery, manufacturing, transportation or public safety have to continue
working in-person, with limited accommodations, people working in these sectors will continue
being exposed. Essential workers are vital to the well-being and survival of the population during
the pandemic, but, at the same time, they are highly vulnerable to the economic and health risks
posed by the pandemic [30]. Specifically, low wage workers are two or three times more likely
than high wage workers to not having access to safety measures that prevent the transmission
of COVID-19 (masks, hand sanitizer, training and so on) [31]. In fact, 65% were unable to practice
social distancing, which may be easier for high wage workers who can do teleworking easily. This
leads to the idea reported elsewhere that social distancing it is a privilege [32-33].

As lockdown measures were progressively lifted, these patterns worsened, and the
social patterning of mobility strengthened. In phases 1 and 2, the main difference in terms of
working and social distancing conditions changed from the dichotomy between essential and
non-essential workers to commuters and teleworkers. People who could telework were able to
stay at home, reducing exposure to COVID-19, while people who work in places that need inperson work continued being more exposed. The differences we observed in mobility by
deprivation are most likely a reflection of the social class of workers that can or cannot telework.
According to a report from the Spanish National Bank, teleworking is far more common among
people with permanent jobs as compared to temporal workers, with 34% of workers in
permanent jobs teleworking for more than half of their work days, as compared to 10% for
temporal workers [35]. Apart from the working conditions and lack of telecommuting
opportunities, other inequalities are underlying the COVID-19 pandemic, such as food insecurity,
unstable housing, or domestic violence [32]. However, there is a limited number of studies that
analyze the intersection of socioeconomic conditions and the vulnerability that it is introduced
by inequalities [36-37]. There are even fewer that, spatially, describe the differences in essential
commuting during the lockdown period or the peak of the pandemic [38-39], even though
wealth inequality has been studied as a health determinant in the literature [40-42].

Our results are similar to those reported in other settings. Therese, K. et al. [32] found a
socioeconomic and racial component in subway travelling while the pandemic; areas with the

210

217

lower median income, a greater percentage of individuals who identify as non-white and/or
Hispanic/Latino, a greater percentage of essential workers, and a greater percentage of
healthcare workers had more subway use during the pandemic. Ayyub, 2020 [33] sheds a light
on the second component of the vulnerability imposed by COVID-19; there are people for whom
staying home means a drop in their income and familiar wage problems. This is especially
important for the informal economy, and some sectors such as construction and agriculture that
rely on in-person labor. It is estimated that around 2 to 4 million people in Spain have entered
poverty during the lockdown [34] due to working in the informal economy.

Our study has several limitations. First, our baseline mobility data was limited to
November 2019, in a different season, meaning that mobility patterns may have changed
beyond the role of the lockdown. Second, we lacked a mobility estimate for the complete reopening phase, and relied on the week before that re-opening fully took place. This does not
allow us to estimate the heterogeneity and social patterning of mobility during the actual
reopening. Our deprivation index was calculated using data from the 2011 census, and there
may be a degree of misclassification. However, as shown in previous studies, inequalities in
Madrid continue increasing [43], and segregation continues intensifying [44], so our results
represent a conservative estimation of these inequalities. Finally, the modifiable areal unit
problem (MAUP) could have been a problem of this project’s methodology as it introduces
statistical bias that can impact the results. Nevertheless, the mobility areas were created to
counteract this possible phenomenon.

235

As Spain entered a second COVID-19 wave with large outbreaks in Madrid in September
2020, the regional government of Madrid started a series of neighborhood-level lockdowns that
prohibited non-work-related mobility. However, these lockdowns still forced workers that
cannot telework to be physically present at their job locations, frequently outside their
residential neighborhood. Our results show that these types of policies may have negative
impacts on poorer neighborhoods, as their residents are more likely to have to work in person.
