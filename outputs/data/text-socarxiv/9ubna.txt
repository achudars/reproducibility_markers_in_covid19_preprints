The Impact of COVID-19 on American A i de o ard China:
Does Local Incidence Rate Matter?

Abstract

Linking local COVID-19 and population statistics to a U.S.-based survey we recently conducted,
we study the spatial variation in the impact of COVID-19 on American a i de o ard China.
The research strategy capitalizes on differential local COVID-19 incidence rates as varying
dosages of the COVID-19 impact across local contexts in the U.S. Our results reveal negative yet
heterogeneous effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on American a i de o ard
China. We find that a greater local exposure to COVID-19 is associated with a lower level of
trust in Chinese and a less favorable attitude toward China. These findings lend consistent
support to behavioral immune system theory by bridging the literature on contextual variations in
public opinion, with broader implications for U.S. China relations.

Introduction
Subsequent to the worldwide outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is a sharp rise of negative
attitudes toward China in many countries (Silver, Devlin, and Huang 2020a). This is also true in
the United States, the country that has suffered the largest numbers of confirmed COVID-19
infection cases and COVID-19-related deaths (World Health Organization 2020a). The impact of
COVID-19 on American mind has been deep, as millions of Americans have lost loved ones,
jobs, worry-free lifestyles, and freedom of movement and activities to this protracted pandemic.
Given the origin of the pandemic outbreak in Wuhan, a city in central China, China has been
blamed for spreading the virus to the world. A rib ion of he pandemic o break o China
failure to contain the virus has also been propelled by the fact that the Chinese government first
knew about the virus in November 2019 but did not inform the rest of the world until late
December 2019 (World Health Organization 2020b). Along with others, many opinion
influencers, such as Donald Trump, the U.S. President from 2016 to 2020, called COVID-19
he Chine e ir , f r her f eling he a ocia ion in man people mind be een he
pandemic and China. As a result, hostility against China and the Chinese in the U.S. has been
escalating. Hundreds of confrontational or discriminatory incidents toward Chinese and other
Asian Americans in the U.S. have been reported (Gover, Harper, and Langton 2020). Has
COVID-19 really caused Americans to have negative attitudes toward China?
Mass media have already given

cl e a o h American a i des toward China

would be affected by COVID-19. It has been reported that the Chinese local governments
i hheld i al informa ion regarding W han o break until it was too late for other countries to
take preventative measures (e.g., Barnes 2020; Feng and Cheng 2020; Morello 2020). Thus,
members of the American public tend to associate their suffering from COVID-19, be it physical,

financial, or emotional, with China. Opinion surveys reveal that most Americans generally agree
that China should be held partially responsible for the pandemic outbreak in the U.S. (Silver,
Devlin, and Huang 2020b).
Research on pandemics similarly suggests a link between COVID-19 and negative
attitudes toward China. Studies of past infectious disease pandemics have offered us many
examples of negative attitudes toward various groups believed to be responsible for the outbreak.
A line of p chological re earch long de o ed o nder anding h man p chological reac ion
to infectious pathogens focuses on ha i called he beha ioral imm ne

em (Schaller and

Park 2011). In this literature, researchers have found that pathogen-threat perceptions often
ac i a e people

ocial a oidance a i de /beha ior o ard ho e ho are po en iall

ick, a

self-protection (Taylor 2019). Thus, the rise in negative attitudes toward Chinese or China may
result from pathogen-induced aversive responses due to the widely-held belief that the COVID19 pandemic originated in China. Furthermore, recent developments in cognitive social
psychology have shown us that attitudes are quite malleable and responsive to contextual stimuli
(Schwarz 2007; Schwarz and Sudman 2012). A study of local COVID-19 infection rates and
public opinion toward China would help advance our knowledge concerning how a public health
crisis can also shape public opinion.
The main premise of this study is that individual Americans e po re to COVID-19 and
their associated threat perceptions vary markedly across local contexts, which could, in turn,
trigger varying attitudes toward Chinese or China. Capitalizing on this idea, we develop a
research strategy to identify the dosage effect of COVID-19, operationalized as differential local
COVID-19 incidence rates, on attitudes toward China. More concretely, we conduct a nationallevel quantitative study of attitudes toward Chinese and China by supplementing our U.S.-based

survey, conducted in August 2020, with local COVID-19 statistics and population
characteristics. We measure attitudes toward Chinese by the respondents expressed trust in
Chinese and examine whether contextual variations in cumulative COVID-19 incidence rates
within local county-clusters adversely affect this trust. We conduct additional placebo tests with
three control groups: Japanese, Indians, and Americans. To further assess the broader
implications for U.S. China relations, we extend our analysis to examine whether the COVID-19
do age aria ion

a country.
Our empirical results consistently support the hypothesis that local COVID-19 incidence

aggregate and individual levels. Placebo tests reveal that this COVID-19 effect is particularly
strong with regard to trust in Chinese, relative to trust in Japanese, Indians, and Americans.
Besides the key findings on trust in Chinese, we also find a similar dosage effect of COVID-19
on American unfavorable attitudes toward China. These findings suggest that the effects of the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on American a i de o ard China are profo nd e
heterogeneous.
COVID-19 and Attitudes toward China in the U.S.
As of March 2021, there have been over 115 million confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide,
with 29 million in the United States (World Health Organization 2020a). One year after the
U.S. s first COVID-19 case, this country persistently stands as the world s No.1 country in total
confirmed cases and deaths from the global pandemic, with these figures still increasing. To the
best of our existing knowledge, the novel coronavirus emerged from Wuhan, China, in
November 2019 (Holshue et al. 2020). However, China did not officially inform other countries

about their increasing number of COVID-19 infections until human-to-human transmissions
went out of control in late December. The delay in information-sharing by China has caused
many people in many countries, especially in the U.S., to blame China for its inadequate efforts
in stopping the virus from spreading abroad.
In the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, surveys and news reports in many western
countries have reported that their citizens tend to hold China accountable for the pandemic. A
fourteen-country survey conducted in the summer of 2020 by the Pew Research Center
suggested that most respondents in each of the fourteen surveyed countries viewed China
unfavorably (Silver, Devlin, and Huang 2020a). In particular, 73% of Americans held
unfavorable views toward China, while over 50% thought that China was responsible for
spreading the virus (Silver, Devlin, and Huang 2020b). Negative views of China and the Chinese
are also ubiquitous in a broad spectrum of the U.S. news outlets and social media. For example,
the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) published an article with the headline, China Is the Very Sick
Man of Asia, which triggered the Chinese authorities to expel three WSJ reporters from China
(Mead 2020). Some other reports called into question the official numbers of COVID-19 cases
and deaths from the Ministry of Health of the People Rep blic of China (Kisa and Kisa 2020).
Scholars have expressed similar concerns that Chinese local authorities could have intentionally
underreported actual figures and delayed transparent information-sharing, severely limiting
countries like the U.S. from taking timely mitigation strategies (Khosrawipour et al. 2020; Zhao
et al. 2020).
With infected cases and deaths from the disease increasing, there were frequent reports of
hostile attitudes and behaviors toward Chinese and other Asians across the United States (Gover,
Harper, and Langton 2020). When the first COVID-19 case occurred in the U.S., businesses in

Ne York Ci

China o n suddenly lost up to 70% of their regular sales (Chen, Zhang, and

Liu 2020). Over half of Chinese Americans perceived health-related Sinophobia since the onset
of the U.S. pandemic, online and in person (Cheah et al. 2020). Moreover, many Chinese and
other Asians were verbally abused, spat at, and attacked by infuriated Americans (Cohen 2020).
In some ways, these attitudes and behaviors are reminiscent of an old perception of the Chinese
as carriers and spreaders of diseases, perpe a ing long anding Yello Peril

ereotypes

(Chen, Zhang, and Liu 2020).
Historically, there were similar instances of aversive perceptions and behaviors toward
minority groups during past infectious disease pandemics. For instance, the bubonic plague
(1347 51), which killed 25% of the European population, prompted collective violence against
the Jews, who were accused of poisoning wells and food supplies (Cohn 2012). Again, the more
recent Ebola outbreak (2014 15) resulted in the shunning of individuals from affected countries,
especially those of African descent, in the U.S. (Fischer et al. 2019). This time, with COVID-19,
Americans tend to have negative emotions directed toward people from China and other Asian
countries (Rzymski and Nowicki 2020).
A line of psychological research helps us better understand the relationship between
COVID-19 and attitudes toward Chinese and China. Beha ioral imm ne

em heor

suggests that, in response to perceived health threats, people tend to develop negative
perceptions or aggressive behaviors toward the infected population (Schaller and Park 2011;
Taylor 2019). This response is due to pathogen-induced reactions that activate group-based
aversive reactions against those deemed to be at high risk for disease transmission (Weiner 1995;
Corrigan et al. 2003). This theory helps explain why Chinese and other East Asians, exemplified

by Japanese and Koreans, who can appear to be Chinese, have fallen victim to verbal or
physical attacks during the pandemic (Gover, Harper, and Langton 2020).
Hence, both the media and the psychological literature suggest a causal link between
COVID-19 and negative attitudes toward Chinese and China. While the association is observed,
proving it to be causal is difficult. For example, it is not possible to conduct a social experiment
so that some Americans are randomly assigned to be controls, i.e., by being unaffected by
COVID-19. It is also hard to find a suitable instrumental variable because the occurrence of
COVID-19 is historically unique and thus non-repeatable. Empirical evaluation of this causal
relationship requires other approaches. In this study, we resort to a dosage design. In a nutshell,
while it is not possible to have a group of Americans who are unaffected by COVID-19 as
controls, the extent to which Americans are affected by COVID-19 varies substantially by
locality. Thus, we explore regional variations in local COVID-19 incident rates and test the
hypotheses that Americans living in more affected communities tend to have more negative
attitudes toward Chinese and China.
Utilizing the contextual variations in the intensity of COVID-19 enables us not only to
consider the possible causal relationship between COVID-19 and negative attitudes toward
Chinese and China, but also to understand how social contexts shape public opinion in general.
Research in survey methodology in the past few decades has established that public attitudes are
generally context-sensitive and responsive to changes in environment (Schwarz 2007). While
cognitive social psychologists have studied how contexts affect attitudes, existing studies mostly
deal with manipulated contextual variations within survey environments by varying
questionnaire designs or experiment-induced contextual stimuli (Schwarz and Sudman 2012). So
far, different contextual stimuli emerging from regional variations in the real world remain

under-studied. Our research shows how American
local COVID-19 incidence rate

contextual public health environment

i.e.,

affects their attitudes toward Chinese and China.

Spatial Variations in COVID-19 Outbreaks and Attitudes toward China
We know that most Americans do not have much direct knowledge about other countries and
thus do not have firm opinions about people in these countries (Xie and Jin forthcoming). When
asked by survey researchers about their attitudes toward China, respondents form heir opinion
from their personal understanding of the questions. Schwarz and his associates (Schwarz 2007;
Schwarz and Sudman 2012) have called such responses context-sensitive. If we extend
Sch ar

con e

re ponden

from q e ionnaire manip la ion o local ocial con e , e e pec ha

e pre ed a i de toward China may vary by the geographical disparities of

COVID-19 severity. To illustrate, let us assume that one mechanism for the negative impact of
COVID-19 on attitudes toward China and Chinese is the psychological association between
COVID-19 and China. That is, COVID-19 triggers negative feelings toward China and Chinese.
When COVID-19 outbreaks are more severe locally, this association is made more salient, as
individuals are more aware of negative consequences of COVID-19 and may perceive Chinese
and China less favorably.
Thi rea oning h

implie ha indi id al China-threat perceptions may grow with the

increasing local severity of COVID-19, which could, in turn, provoke negative attitudes toward
Chinese and China. Specifically, we hypothesize that if individuals view Chinese negatively
because of this pandemic, residents of harder-hit areas could be less likely to trust Chinese than
counterparts of less hard-hit areas (Hypothesis 1). Examining trust in Chinese potentially
characterizes the prevailing negative emotions toward this group observed in the U.S. by
drawing upon group-based social judgment, which usually reflect implicit risk assessments for

interpersonal interactions. The potential divides between individuals who trust Chinese and those
who do not may result in differential inclinations to deal with Chinese across various dosages of
local COVID-19 outbreaks.
Furthermore, we analogously anticipate that residents of harder-hit areas will also hold
less favorable attitudes toward China as a nation (Hypothesis 2). We additionally investigate
American perceptions of China as the country where the novel coronavirus is originated. This
is motivated by the fact that the U.S. has arguably been both the most harmed country (by the
standards of cumulative cases and deaths) and the country where the strongest anti-China
sentiments have surfaced amid the global pandemic. As some analysts have already speculated,
the COVID-19 pandemic might precipitate a new turning point in shifting U.S. China relations
(Haass 2020). Thus, inspecting ordinary American a i de o ard China could shed valuable
insights into one of he orld s most vital bilateral national relationships nowadays. In the next
section, we will detail the various data sources and analytical approaches we utilize to test the
two hypotheses.
Data and Analytic Strategy
Data
This analysis incorporates original data from a nation-wide public opinion survey fielded in midAugust 2020 and various public datasets for local county-level COVID-19 cases and population
characteristics. Our primary analytic sample comprises 1,793 adult participants from 50 U.S.
states and Washington DC, whom we recruited as a nationwide probability sample using the
online survey platform KnowledgePanel by Ipsos. The target population consisted of noninstitutionalized adults age 18 an older residing in the United States, with a sample response rate

of 79%1. Our survey s key strengths include the availability of 1,641 unique five-digit zip codes
for all the respondents locations,2 granular assessments of their China-related attitudes amid the
pandemic, and rich information on socio-demographic backgrounds.
Key Explanatory Variable
Consistent with Hypothesis 1, we aim to capture the re ponden

local COVID-19 outbreaks as

varying COVID-19 dosages that are potentially shaping their variable attitudes toward
Chinese/China. Con idering ha indi id al a i de o ard China migh reflect
contemporaneous local epidemic stimuli, both spatial and temporal variations can be vital to
understanding such attitudes. We use he

r e re ponden

re iden ial ip code to link

individual-level attitudes to the local spatial-temporal variations in COVID-19 severity.
We derived the contextual measure of local COVID-19 outbreaks, our key explanatory
variable, by harmonizing two public datasets with our survey. We obtained the county- and dayspecific cumulative counts of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. (New York Times 2020) for all
survey par icipan

personal survey-completion dates (i.e., August 12 18). We additionally

acquired the county-level population counts as of 2019 (U.S. Census Bureau 2020). Using these
two datasets, we constructed the county- and day-specific COVID-19 incidence rates, which are
interpretable as cumulative cases per 100 persons within the local county. The county-level
cumulative COVID-19 incidence rates then form the fundamental building blocks for
characterizing the local COVID-19 dosages mapped o indi id al residential locations.

The construction of the ultimate indicator of local COVID-19 dosage additionally
involves specifying the range/level of geographic aggregation, which must reconcile conceptual
validity with data limitations. A primary difficulty in matching the COVID-19 severity of the
re ponden

five-digit zip codes to that of residential counties is that one zip code may border

several neighboring counties so that we should not simply impute county-level statistics to the
zip code level. Thus, we constructed respondent-centered geographic units, called the countyclusters, according to re ponden

residential locations. Recent transportation statistics show

that over 3.3 million Americans commute at least 50 miles each way per day. However, most
American daily travel distances were within a total of 100 miles (U.S. Department of
Transportation, 2017). We have accordingly tested multiple alternative definitions for countyclusters between 20- and 100-mile buffers. We adopt a 60-mile buffer in part because we believe
it is sufficiently large to circumscribe the geographic range of daily activities and information
flows for most Americans. Moreover, the results yielded from the 60-mile buffer are bounded
between the extremely low and extremely high estimates based on alternative radiuses, which
could help avoid under- or overestimates. Our sensitivity analyses further warrant that the core
findings are highly robust to all the alternative radius specifications. Therefore, throughout this
analysis, we consistently use the average cumulative incidence rates in the individualized
county-cluster buffers to capture varying intensities of local COVID-19 infections.
Dependent Variables
This analysis mainly considers two binary outcomes. The first outcome is individual-level trust
in Chinese. Specifically, our survey asked, Generall
Chinese people can be r

ed, or ha

peaking, o ld o

a

ha

o canno be oo caref l in dealing i h hem? We

requested that survey participants choose the response that was closer to their opinion out of two

given choices. The first choice, Mo Chine e people can be trusted, indicates a trustful
attitude toward Chinese; and the second choice, Yo can ne er be oo caref l in dealing i h
Chinese people, reflec s par icipan

distrustful attitudes toward this group.

We e amine indi id al ( n)fa orable a i de o ard China a he econd dependen

r e i em

has appeared widely in reports and studies on attitudes toward China. Thus, we can benchmark
our latest results against prior findings on this topic (Wang et al. forthcoming; Xie and Jin
forthcoming).
Controls Related to the Outcome Variable
We use trust in Americans as a control variable when predicting trust in Chinese, to capture
individual-level unobserved heterogeneities in social trust of any group, and to conduct placebo
tests. We also employ trust in two more Asian groups to conduct placebo tests, including trust in
Japanese and trust in Indians. These control groups potentially facilitate more nuanced
assessments of the reported spillover stereotypes against other Asians. Our approach takes
ad an age of he e gro p gradien in pheno pical and c l ral difference

i h Chine e. To

ensure higher inter-item comparability, these questions for group-based trustworthiness
perceptions presented the same wordings and binary-choice sets, except that they considered
different national groups.

Other Attitudes toward China
To cap re indi id al a e men of ho China handled he COVID-19 pandemic and explain
their trust in Chinese further, we tailored two questions to inspect China-related attitudes. One
question was, In o r opinion, ho re pon ible i China for he COVID-19 outbreak in the
U.S.? The fo r po ible an

Local Socioeconomic Contexts
We also employ the 2018 American Community Survey (pooled five-year cross-sectional
surveys for 2014 2018) to characterize the county-cluster-level socioeconomic contexts (U.S.
Census Bureau 2019). We include in our analysis the local averages in education and income
levels to remove potential confounding due to variations in local socioeconomic conditions
(Phelan, Link, and Tehranifar 2010). Accordingly, we control for average percentages of
respondents (1) with a high-school diploma; (2) with some college; and (3) with a bachelor
degree or above; as well as for (4) average income per capita.

Other Demographic Controls
Apart from the aforementioned variables, we consider gender, age, age squared, current marital
status, and homeownership status. No abl , e al o incl de re ponden

race/e hnici

and

highest educational attainment in the analysis as prior studies frequently found that racial
minorities and the less educated generally had lower social trust (Alesina and La Ferrara 2002;
Smith 2010). We use the self-identified racial-ethnic categories, including non-Hispanic Whites
(reference group), non-Hispanic Blacks, Hispanics, and Others. Our educational categories
consistently distinguish individuals without a high school diploma (reference group) from those
with a high- chool diploma, i h ome college, and finall , i h a bachelor degree or abo e.
Analytic Strategy
The current study consists of three main steps. We first characterize the sample with a
descriptive summary and the aggregated percentages of trust in Chinese, Japanese, Indians, and
Americans across county-cluster incidence-rate quartiles. We then predict trust in Chinese by
estimating a series of logistic regression models highlighting the role of COVID-19 incidence, as
proxied by varying county-cluster-level incidence rates. In predicting trust in Chinese
(Hypothesis 1), we estimate a series of nested binary logistic regression models as shown by
Equation (1):

is the log odds of trusting Chinese. IR stands for

the cumulative COVID-19 incidence rate for the jth survey participant from the ith county-cluster.
Its corresponding coefficient, β1, is of central interest to this study. As discussed, we control for
Trust_A (trust in Americans) to capture individual-level unobserved heterogeneities in general
social trust. We use Local_SES (county-cluster SES contexts) similarly to remove potential
confounding from locally concentrated socioeconomic disadvantages. Finally, X denotes the full
set of demographic controls, and A represents the two variables measuring China-related
attitudes. The overarching aim for the second step is to assess whether the local incidence rate
indeed predicts trustworthiness perceptions and the sensitivity to demographic and attitudinal
controls. We conduct supplementary placebo regression analysis predicting trust in Japanese,
Indians, and Americans to examine potential stereotypical perceptions overflowing to these
groups.

The last step of our analysis examines indi id al favorable attitudes toward China
(𝐹 , using the heterogeneous COVID-19 dosages (𝐼𝑅 ) again as the key predictor. We
summarize the full model set-up in Equation (2). In brief, this third step is similar to (1), but we
include 𝑌 (trust in Chinese), the primary outcome in Step 2, as a mediating variable. This last
step serves to test Hypothesis 2, which evaluates the broader implications of COVID-19 for
U.S. China relations and tests the generalizability of the findings on trust.

Results
Descriptive Summary
We begin by providing a summary of key variables in our primary analytic sample, presented in
Table 1. Reflecting the U.S. general population, our analytic sample is demographically diverse.
Racially, 74.9% were non-Hispanic Whites, 7.1% were non-Hispanic Blacks, 10.2% were
Hispanic, and the remaining 7.9% fell in o O her race ( i h A ian incl ded). The ed ca ional
distribution shows 5.9%, 26.3%, 26.1%, and 41.7% of the sample respondent respectively
attained education of less than high school, high chool, ome college, and a bachelor degree or
above. Across the county-clusters, 24.1%, 24.5%, and 19.3% of residents respectively had
attained a high chool diploma, ome college, and a lea a bachelor degree. Apar from he
key covariates, approximately half of the respondents were male, with the average age being 54
years old (min: 18; max: 91), 62.5% being married, and 80.0% being homeowners.
The two outcomes of interest re eal ha American a i de toward Chinese people are
overall more positive than their attitudes toward China as a country: 67.4% of our survey
participants indicated trust in Chinese, but only 22.3% viewed China as a country through
favorable lens. Our key predictor, the county-cluster-level cumulative COVID-19 incidence rate
with the average being 1.6% and the standard deviation being 0.7, suggests large contextual
disparities in the severity of local COVID-19 outbreaks. Across the four countries referenced in
the survey questionnaire, trustworthiness was much lower for Chinese than that for the other
three national groups. Whereas only 67.4% of participants trusted Chinese, 77.1% trusted
Americans. Interestingly, the participants expressed trust of the other two Asian national groups
at higher proportions (80.4% for Indians; 84.3 % for Japanese).
[Table 1 about here]

Overall, the respondents held negative views regarding how China handled the COVID19 pandemic. The majority (86.5%) of survey participants thought that China was at least
partially responsible for the COVID-19 outbreaks in the U.S., with only 13.5% holding China
no a all re pon ible. Furthermore, approximately 75% of the respondents were skeptical of
China official COVID-19 statistics, leaving only a quarter believing China reported COVID19 figures.
Aggregate Percentages Indicating Trust in Chinese
We now present in Figure 2 the aggregate-level descriptive statistics for the relationship between
re ponden

trust in each of the four groups

Chinese, Japanese, Indians, and Americans

and

local COVID-19 severity. The x-axis shows the four different quartiles of the local countycluster COVID-19 incidence rates, and the y-axis indicates the percentages of respondents
indicating trust in the peoples of the four nations.
[Figure 2 about here]
Generally downward, clear patterns emerge in he e fo r co n rie c r e . First, the
percentage trusting Chinese declines steadily as local areas become harder-hit by COVID-19,
supporting Hypothesis 1. In addition, there is also a negative, but less steep, downward slope for
trust in Japanese. For Indians and Americans, however, the decline in trust is non-monotonic.
These cross-ethnic differences confirm the idea that Americans generally consider East Asians to
be more A ian-like han So h A ian (Lee and Ramakri hnan 2020).
Trust in Chinese
Descriptive results in Figure 2 may be misleading if certain characteristics, be it individual-level
or contextual, are associated both with local COVID-19 incidence rate and with attitudes toward
Chinese. To rule out potential confounders that may distort the observed association as in Figure

2, we now conduct a multivariate analysis including relevant covariates that we collected in the
survey. In Table 2, we present the results from logistic regression models predicting whether or
not a respondent perceives Chinese people as trustworthy.3 Our baseline model (Model 1) only
considers the local COVID-19 incidence rate, trust in Americans, and the local SES contexts.
Echoing Hypothesis 1, Model 1 demonstrates a substantial and highly statistically significant
(p<0.001) local COVID-19 dosage effect. To highlight, when the cumulative incidence rate in a
local county-cluster increases by one confirmed case per 100 persons, the average persons odds
of trusting Chinese decline by 35.6 % (i.e., 1-exp (-0.44) =0.356). This substantial COVID-19
dosage effect suggests that exposure to a more severely infected local context indeed strengthen
distrustful attitudes toward Chinese. Furthermore, local socioeconomic disadvantages generally
predict lower trust in Chinese. For example, the percentage of high school graduates in a local
area has a strong negative association. As anticipated, respondents who generally trust
Americans also have higher odds of trusting Chinese, indeed 10 times higher, than those who do
not trust Americans.
[Table 2 about here]
To inspect how individual-level demographic factors might attenuate the effect of local
COVID-19 incidence rate, we further include in Model 2 the demographic controls, including
race/ethnicity, highest educational attainment, gender, age, age squared, marital status, and
homeownership status. Our key coefficient of interest only declines by about 0.02 (about a 1.3%
decrease in the odds of trusting Chinese). This model also shows that better-educated
respondents tend to trust Chinese more, consistent with literature on the positive relationships

To ensure better representativeness of the U.S. general population, we applied individual-based weights in the
subsequent regression analyses.

between educational attainment and generalized trust (Huang, van den Brink, and Groot 2011;
Oskarsson et al. 2017).
We further incorporate COVID-related attitudes toward China to understand their
mediating role for the reduced-form effect of local COVID-19 dosage on trust in Chinese. It
turns out that the two COVID-related attitudes toward China only slightly weaken the local
COVID-19 dosage effect, and both of them are predictive of lower trust in Chinese: the belief
that the Chinese official statistics on COVID-19 are not trustworthy reduces the odds of trust in
Chinese by about 52.8%, while the belief that China should be held responsible for the U.S.
outbreak reduces this trust odds even more (at 60.9%).
In summary, Models 1 3 consistently support Hypothesis 1 that trust in Chinese is
negatively associated with higher COVID-19 incidence rates in local areas. Figure 3 illustrates
this negative relationship in terms of predicted probabilities of trusting Chinese based on Model
3. For an individual from a county-cluster where the cumulative COVID-19 incidence rate is
0.5%, the predicted probability of trusting Chinese is 0.74 (95% CI: [0.70,0.77]). As the
incidence rate increases to 3.5%, the probability drops to 0.56 (95% CI: [0.48,0.63]). In addition,
we check the robustness of our key finding using various alternative county-cluster radiuses (see
Appendix A1). Different radius operationalizations (ranging from 20-mile to 100-mile) yield the
same key finding: the worse the local COVID-19 outbreak is, the less one tends to trust people
from China.
[Figure 3 about here]
Echoing the aggregate-level descriptive findings, we conducted placebo regression
analyses for trust in Japanese, Indians, and Americans. Figure 4 displays the coefficient estimates

of the key variable from the placebo tests based on models analogous to Model 3 of Table 2. It is
evident that the local COVID-19 dosage effect is only statistically significant for Chinese.
[Figure 4 about here]
Attitudes toward China
To further gauge the implications for U.S. China relations and to examine the generalizability of
the earlier findings about trust in Chinese, we further evaluate the COVID-19 dosage effect on
indi id al favorable attitudes toward China. Results are presented in Table 3, with three
models sequentially including other variables beyond the local COVID-19 dosage. Moreover, in
predicting favorable attitudes toward China this time, we further con ider di r

in Chine e

as a mediating variable.
[Table 3 about here]
Model 1 controls for local COVID-19 incidence rate, demographic characteristics, and
socioeconomic contexts, except for China-related attitudes. The COVID-19 dosage effect on
favorable attitudes toward China holds true, whereby one more confirmed case per 100 local
persons reduces the odds of viewing China favorably by about 27.4% on average. This local
COVID-19 effect on indi id al favorable attitude toward China is consistent with the earlier
estimate for trust in Chinese (see Model 1 in Table 2).
Models 2 and 3 sequentially assess how distrust and blaming emotions might help
explain the local COVID-19 dosage effect. Model 2 controls for distrust in Chinese and distrust
in China official statistics. Although only reducing the earlier dosage effect slightly, these two
covariates effectively increase the explained variation in terms of pseudo-R-squared by about
12%. In addition, both distrust variables significantly predict viewing China less favorably
(p<0.001), and their estimated effects in Model 2 are relatively larger than the contextual effect:

the odds of viewing China as a country favorably are 67.0% lower for those who distrust Chinese
people and 80.8% lower for those who suspect the Chinese official COVID-19 statistics. As
expected, Model 3 shows the negative impact of blaming emotions on attitudes toward China, as
captured by the belief that China is responsible for the pandemic in the U.S. On average, people
ho belie e in China re pon ibili

ha e 56.8% lo er odd of viewing China favorably than

those who do not.
In brief, we find imilar re l in o r

r e for he re ponden

a i de toward China

as those for their trust in Chinese. We in erpre he finding o reflec he re ponden
psychological association between their local community
origin of COVID-19

ffering and he commonl accep ed

Chinese in China. The beliefs that Chinese people are not trustworthy and

that China was responsible for COVID-19 outbreaks in the U.S. explain some but not all local
COVID-19 contextual variation.
Discussion and Conclusion
Previous studies have suggested that infectious disease pandemics tend to trigger a per on
social avoidance attitudes or/and behaviors toward those deemed to be sick or threatening
(Schaller and Park 2011; Taylor 2019). Linking survey data to multiple public datasets, we
consistently find that local COVID-19 outbreaks have shaped how people in the U.S. view China
and Chinese. Our analysis highlights the role of local incidence rate within individuals
residential county-clusters, the spatially varying dosage of the COVID-19 outbreak, as a
meaningful predictor of their attitudes toward China. Our results strongly support the hypotheses
that residents of harder-hit communities generally trust Chinese people less and hold a less
favorable attitude toward China as a country than peers living in less-impacted communities.

Placebo tests with three control groups further indicate that the COVID-related trust erosion is
present only for Chinese, but not for Japanese, Indians, or Americans.
This study makes three significant contributions. Fir , hile American ho ile attitudes
and behaviors toward Chinese and Chinese Americans in the U.S. have been reported to be on
the rise since the onset of the pandemic, few studies have systematically examined the
underlying public opinion. This study explores a unique form of anti-Chinese sentiments
perceptions of this group being less trustworthy in the American p blic e e . We have reliably
shown ha American di r

of Chine e, as well as their unfavorable attitudes toward China,

have become highly prevalent among those with greater community-level exposure to COVID19. Moreover, American distrust of Chinese significantly predicts their less favorable attitudes
toward China. Thus, this study coherently indicates that American distrust of Chinese is
contextual. From this, we conjecture that future bilateral ties between these two countries may
hinge considerably on how Americans weather the adverse impacts of the pandemic.
Second, we empirically validate behavioral immune system theory by investigating local
contextual variations in public opinion. Studies of behavioral immune system theory have
indica ed ha pandemic of en ac i a e indi id al ri k-evading responses to perceived threats,
but evidence for the contextual heterogeneities of such responses is still scarce (Schaller and
Park 2011; Taylor 2019). Meanwhile, we have also advanced knowledge about contextual
variations in attitudes by illustrating how the local social environments in which individuals
daily lives are embedded influence their perceptions (Schwarz 2007; Schwarz and Sudman
2012). By exploiting spatial variations in epidemiological shocks from COVID-19 and situating
attitudes within the local contexts, we have bridged the existing literatures that have previously
been separated along these two lines.

Third, the study renders broader implications for the escalating inter-racial and interethnic tensions in the U.S. The pandemic has reinforced intergroup boundaries between the
American mainstream and certain Asian ethnic groups in light of popular media coverage. Our
results consistently indicate that the pandemic ha

or ened American percep ion of Chine e

in China and potentially Chinese Americans as well. However, it remains to be seen whether the
main ream negative feelings toward ethnic Chinese will persist beyond this protracted
pandemic.
Despite all these contributions, this study undeniably has several shortcomings. Although
we have clarified the relationship between local COVID-19 incidence and American attitudes
toward China, we do not know cognitive-emotional mechanisms accounting for this relationship.
We do not have longitudinal data of the respondents before COVID-19 so that we cannot study
within-person changes over time. Recall that the former President Trump launched a trade war
with China in 2018, escalating US-China tensions. Exposure to social media and trade-war
related information may have also reinforced he p blic de eriora ing percep ion of China
prior to COVID-19. We call for future studies to thoroughly examine these issues. At the
minimum, we hope this study has demonstrated that indi id al attitudes are indeed susceptible
to local social environments and will stimulate other researcher in ere in studying local
contextual variations in public opinion.
