Abstract
The COVID-19 Pandemic in Canada represents a very troubling period as individuals
confront a powerful "invisible" enemy killer in the form of the COVID-19 virus. This
historical juncture is important to analyze because it constitutes a moment where
collective anxieties become widespread and collective resources are mobilized to address
them. Using market segmentation analysis, the purpose of the study is to produce a
portrait of collective anxieties, paying special attention to the typical population
segments in the Canadian population differentiated by their particular concerns about
health and social conditions in the country and the world. The study used as its data
source a survey sample of 4,600 adult Canadians aged 15 years old and over during
the confinement period of March 29 2020 to April 3 2020 and collected by Statistics
Canada. Attitudinal domain items (12 in total) included concerns about personal
and household health, the health system, the ability to cooperate and support
during and after the crisis, family stress and others. A market segmentation analysis
using Principal Components and k-means cluster analysis of these domain items
revealed the presence of six major population segments: Health Conditions Anxious
(13%), Health System Overload Anxious (26%), Angst-Free (23%), Inner-Bubble
Conditions Anxious (12%), Outer-Bubble Conditions Anxious (25%) and World
Conditions Anxious (1%). The segment mottos were as follows: "Glad I Have A Health
Card!", "How Many Beds Do We Have?", "I'm Not Worried!, "My Bubble May Be In
Trouble!", "Other Bubbles May Be In Trouble! and "It’s the End of the World As We Know
It!”. Inner-Bubble Conditions Anxious members displayed the higher average scores
of collective anxiety and Angst-Free members, the lowest. Market segmentation is a
useful tool for decision makers to categorize population members by their typical
attitudinal traits and, by doing so, facilitate better public campaigns, help design
messages, and implement changes that can promote more efficient ways to deal with
the various psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 confinement.

1.0. Background
According to Strong (1990) a major outbreak of a fatal epidemic disease is generally followed
by plagues of fear, panic, suspicions and stigma. During epidemics such as the present
COVID-19 outbreak happening in Canada, there is an elevated level concern for personal and
family safety as well as dread about the human condition in general. In the context of
epidemics, Hunt (1999) defines collective anxieties as responses to "perceived situations of
danger, whether real or imagined" (p.509). Through a mechanism of "amplification",
individuals may project anxieties from personal domains to more impersonal ones such as
their neighbourhoods, communities, countries and even the world (Hume, 2000). Studying the
collective anxieties occurring during an epidemic involves a systematic examination of facets
such as the degree of suspicion in catching the disease, routes of disease contagion such as
breathing or touching surfaces, the evaluation of self-protection and family protection
mechanisms as well the perceived negative outcomes of the epidemic occurring in society
(Kelly, 1990; Da Silva et al., 2020).
The COVID‐19 virus has caused major disruptions across the world, after being declared as a
pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 31 2020 (WHO, 2020). This
pandemic has led to several disruptions for most of the world's population. In Canada, the
first cases of infections were observed in travellers from China 2 and reported to the press in
January 2020. Given a steady climb in cases, on March 25 2020, an emergency aid bill passed
and Canada made 14-day quarantine mandatory for all arrivals. Three days later Prime
Minister Trudeau announced a ban on air travel for those with COVID symptoms. Canada is
presently undergoing the so-called "second" phase. As of October 25 2020, there had been a
total of 9,946 deaths attributed to the COVID-19 virus in Canada 3 . A larger number is
expected in the coming months. Most of the reported cases are in Canada's two most
populous provinces, Ontario and Quebec, which have declared different sanitary
measures and confinement restrictions to deal with virus spread in the population.
The collective anxieties manifested in the Canadian population configure a set of potential
market segments. Market segments are groups of individuals who are very similar in their
reaction to one or more mix of environmental elements, and as such, can be targeted by
public health campaigns aimed at promoting social well-being (Grover and Briens, 2006). In a
psychographic segmentation analysis, for instance, individuals are divided into different
groups on the basis of psychosocial characteristics (Lin, 2002). This technique divides the
market into segments on the basis of interest, values, opinion, personality characteristics,
attitudes using techniques of factor analysis, cluster analysis and canonical correlation
(Tynan and Drayton, 1987).
Using a sample of the adult population of Canada, the central objectives of the marketing
segmentation analysis presented here is to break down the population into meaningful
clusters of individuals (homogeneous) in terms of their psychographic traits during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Three central questions guided the segmentation analysis: 1) What
COVID-19 related anxieties are the most commonly reported by Canadians during the
pandemic? 2) Can groups of individuals be differentiated into attitudinal segments or
clusters according to their types of anxieties? and 3) What are the typical socio2

demographic, residential, employment and other psychosocial characteristics of the
members of these segments? The CPSS-Series1 survey conducted by Statistics Canada
was regarded as an ideal data source chosen to empirically explore these three central
research questions and produce a statistical portrait of collective anxieties during the
pandemic 4.
2.0.Sample and Measures
The Canadian Perspective Survey Series1 (CPSS Series1) entitled "Impacts of
COVID-19" is the first of a series of voluntary online surveys that collected
information on knowledge and behaviours of approximately 4,600 Canadians aged
15 years old and over who were residents of the 10 Canadian provinces. It was
administered by Statistics Canada between March 29 2020 to April 3 2020 (the
reference week). The probability panel of the CPSS-Series1 was created by randomly
selecting a subset of the Labour Force Survey (LFS) respondents. The CPSS Series1
survey collected a wide range of information on activities related to health impacts of
the pandemic, routine activities, information on COVID-19, social distancing
practices among others 5.
A total of 12 collective anxiety scales were used for this analysis. These tapped into
COVID-19 perceived concerns attached to various personal, health and societal domains
in the context of the pandemic. Scales were measured as four point scores ones (1=not at
all concerned, 2=somewhat concerned, 3=very concerned and 4=extremely concerned)
which were treated as indicators of low, moderate, high and very high anxiety levels
respectively. The following general question was asked in the CPSS Series1 survey: How
concerned are you about each of the following impacts of COVID-19? (list provided). The
roster of collective anxiety scales items ranked by their average scale scores is presented
in Table 1. Concerns regarding the overload of the health system and vulnerable peoples'
health ranked at top levels of rating in terms of the sources of collective anxiety.
3.0.Statistical Methods and Segment Identification
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and k-means cluster analysis were used as the main
statistical techniques for segment identification (see detail of the methodologies followed in
Punj and Stewart (1983), Grover and Vriens (2006) and Salkind and Rasmussen (2010). In the
first phase, Principal Components (statistical technique aimed at data reduction) extracted 3
major dimensions underlying information contained in the 12 scales of collective anxieties
related items. In the second phase, using component scores of these dimensions capturing
62% of the total data variation, k-means clustering analysis was applied to the CPSS-Series1
data. This clustering algorithm was developed to sort survey respondents into a k number of
clusters through assignments and re-assignments based on the shortest distance between the
This study is the second market segmentation study carried out using CPSS data. The first one, focusing on
routine activities which used CPSS-Series2 data, is available at: https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6vumh/

Statistics Canada has already released major findings of the CPSS-Series1, Series 2 and CPSS-3 surveys
(conducted between March 29-April 3 2020 and June 15-21 2020 respectively), which include: greater
anxieties over personal health and the health of others, that most Canadians were following health guidelines,
greater time spent on the internet and watching television, women were stricter in terms of following guidelines
than men, and youth were less likely to wear masks in public. Sources : 1)

individual and the centroid (mass centre) of the cluster. The distance measure chosen for this
purpose was the Euclidean distance squared. For the cluster analysis k=2 to k=8 segment
solutions were tested. The k=6 solution proved to be the most valid and informative according
to the parsimonious reduction of the Within Sum of Squares (WSS) and the application of the
"elbow" criteria as a stopping rule in the partition of clusters (see technical appendix chart A1).
The validation of the partition of the population into six clusters was verified using Analysis of
Variance (ANOVA) F tests where the cluster membership was used in the prediction of the
socio-demographic and attitudinal characteristics of respondents (see table A-2 in the
technical appendix). The highest predicted power of the cluster partition was found in
reference to the immigrant status of individuals and the perceived mental health traits (3% of
variance explained each). The average inter-correlation between all items found was r=.42. The
highest inter-correlations found were between Canada's Health and World Health (r=.76) and
Canada's Health and Overload of the Health System item (r=.53)

4.0. Findings
4.1. Segment Prevalence and Traits
According to the cluster analysis of the CPSS-Series1 data, six uniquely profiled groups of the
Canadian adult population respondents were identified. Their membership was distributed as
follows: 13% in segment 1, 26% in segment 2, 23% in segment 3, 12% in segment 4, 25% in
segment 5 and 1% in segment 6. Based on the typical activity profiles drawn from the 26
collective anxiety scales, the segments were labeled as follows: Segment 1 – "Health Conditions
Anxious", Segment 2-"Health System Overload Anxious", Segment 3-"Angst-Free", Segment 4"Inner-Bubble Conditions Anxious", Segment 5-"Outer-Bubble Conditions Anxious" and
Segment 6 "World Conditions Anxious". The prevalence 6 (adult population % share) of these
segments is presented in pie chart 1.

A visual representation (PCA bi-plot) of the vector of collective anxiety items and dimensions
underlying the data are displayed in chart 2. The first two components extracted by PCA
accounted for 44.6% of the variance of all activity items. The first dimension represented
by C1 (31.0% of the total variance of items) opposed as polar cases members of the AngstFree segment vs. the rest of segments in terms of a lesser or higher degree of anxiety
regardless of their types. The second dimension, represented by C2 (13.6% of the total
variance of items), opposed the Angst-Free to the Health System Overload Anxious and
World Conditions Anxious segment members as opposites. This opposition reveals a
dimension related to the amplitude of fear from less distant to more distant groups in
society. The biplot also reveals some distinctions between the types anxiety sources
present in the Inside-Bubble Conditions Anxious segment compared to the others (e.g.
greater preoccupations placed on pandemic impacts on personal health, household
health, family stress and home violence).
Statistical Note: In the Chart 2 PCA bi-plot 7, the first two principal components extracted
from the data (C1 and C2) are shown. They are the most fundamental dimensions
summarizing the activity patterns reported by respondents. In the biplot, vectors represent
items which are presented as points in space. The bi-plot of the second component on the first
component is useful as it displays the correlations of variables in terms of various item vectors
of different magnitudes, directions and positions. Proximity of activity traits to group positions
in space suggests an over-representation of these traits with respect to the composition of
groups while greater distances suggests its converse. Correlations between two indicator
variables in component space are equal to the cosines of the angles between the indicator
vectors (θ), or r = cos(θ). Highly correlated variables are located at sharp angles from each
other (θ = 90 degrees or less) while those zero correlated are "orthogonal" to each other (θ = 90
degrees). If variables are perfectly negatively correlated, then θ = 360 degrees (vector in
opposite direction).

4.2. Segment Profile Summaries: Who Are they?
The following are the summary descriptions of the population segments found in the
CPSS-Series3 data:
Segment 1 – Health Conditions Anxious (13% representing 3.9 million adult
Canadians), Segment Motto: "Glad I Have A Health Card!"
Members of this segment are particularly concerned about the state of health conditions
in their households, Canada and the world. Top sources of anxiety for this group are
vulnerable peoples' health and overloading the health system (3.72 and 3.52 score
points on average respectively). Individuals belonging to this segment displayed an
average score of 2.66 points across all 12 scale items. About 71% are married or living in
common law status with a slight over-representation of women in their midst (55%).
About a third (30%) had a level of education equivalent to a bachelor level or beyond
while 40% were employed at work at least part of the reference week. The mental health
pictured revealed that about one in four (24%) reported either a poor or fair state of
mental health.
Segment 2 – Health System Overload Anxious (26% representing 8.2 Million adult
Canadians), Segment Motto: "How Many Beds Do We Have?"
About one quarter of Canadians belong to this population segment. In terms of anxiety
sources, these individuals appear similar to those in the previous segment but are
particularly concerned with the issue of the potential overload of the health system in
Canada (3.40 score points on average). The collapse of the system is a "nightmarish"
situation for segment members. They displayed an average score of 2.70 points across
all 12 scale items. With a slight over-representation of women (55%), it is a relatively
younger segment: 40% were 35 years old or under at the time of the survey. About 35%
reported to be single while 45% had a level of education equivalent to high school
diploma or lower. About one in five (21%) reported a poor or fair state of mental health.
Segment 3 – Angst-Free (23% representing 7.1 million adult Canadians), Segment
Motto:"I'm Not Worried!"
Angst-free individuals are not particularly concerned with any societal impacts of the
pandemic in Canada and show relatively low levels of anxiety compared to members of
the other five population segments. The reason for why this is the case may range from
an enhanced sense of personal security, perceived low infection risks or explicit
minimization of the extent of the pandemic as a problem for society. They displayed the
lowest average score across all 12 anxiety scales: 1.87 points. This segment has a slight
over-representation of males (58%) and lower levels of education equivalent to high
school diplomas or below (40%). More than half (52%) were employed at work for at least
part of the reference week and 46% reported home as their work location. About one in
ten of them (13%) reported either a poor or a fair state of mental health.

9
Segment 4 – Inside-Bubble Conditions Anxious (12% representing 3.7 million adult
Canadians), Segment Motto: "My Bubble May Be In Trouble!"
Like members of other segments, these individuals worried about the health impacts of
the pandemic but single out pandemic impacts closer to the household "bubble" 8 as
sources for anxiety. The family appears as the central foci of concern. Pandemic impacts
in terms personal health, other household members' health, maintaining social ties and
family stress were ranked among the top sources of anxiety for the inside-bubble
anxious individuals (rating these items above 3.00 scale points on average). Individuals
who are members of this segment rated home violence at a higher level compared to
other segment members: average scale score of 1.78 points. Overall, the inside-bubble
anxious group represents the most troubled one of the six segments: they scored the
highest average points across the 12 anxiety scale items: 3.40 points. There is a slight
over-representation of females (55%) and foreign-born individuals (36%) in this
population segment. About 17% of segment members reported either poor or fair levels
of mental health.
Segment 5 – Outside-Bubble Conditions Anxious (25% representing 7.8 Adult
Canadians), Segment Motto: "Other Bubbles May Be In Trouble!"
One quarter of Canadians belong to this population segment. Like members of other
segments, these individuals worry about the health and social impacts of the pandemic
but focus their attention to those occurring outside the household "bubble" which
include Canada and the world. These types of anxiety items are rated at a higher level
compared to items related to impacts worrying inside-bubble segment members.
Members of this segment scored, on average, 2.28 points across all 12 anxiety scale
items. About two thirds of them were married or living with a common law partner (65%)
while almost a third (31%) had an equivalent university bachelor or above diploma.
About 17% of them reported either a poor or fair level of mental health.
Segment 6 – World Conditions Anxious (1% representing 0.4 Million Adult
Canadians), Segment Motto: "It’s The End Of The World As We Know it!"
Members of this small segment constitute genuine "outliers" in the spectrum of collective
anxieties in Canada. They are troubled about all kinds of pandemic impacts but
especially about impacts on the world's population health (average scale score points:
3.36). For them, the COVID-19 virus is a potential "threat" to the survival of humanity.
With a majority of males in its midst, it is heavily over-represented by older individuals
(81% were aged 65 years old and over), and foreign-born individuals (42%). About 49% of
them reported having a high school diploma equivalent or below. Out of the six segment
members, it has the least number of individuals reporting poor or fair levels of mental
health (8%).

A “bubble” is an unofficial term used in Canada to describe people with whom the individual feels
comfortable spending time during the pandemic.

5.0. Reflections
One major contribution of psychographic market segmentation analysis like the one
carried out in this study is the discovery of hidden attitudinal patterns and the ability to
link statistical methods to the monitoring of outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic in
Canada. A statistical portrait of COVID-19 collective anxieties can help federal, regional
and local decision makers to better identify specific and universal market segments and
tailor segment-suited interventions. Rather than “one size fits all” results, public health
programs and activities can be developed for each population cluster and provide tools
that can change perceptions and develop more effective responses to tackle positive and
negative outcomes in the always-changing COVID-19 confinement environment.
The concept of collective anxieties emerging during pandemics such as the COVID-19 in
Canada is closely connected with other concepts such personal experiences, perceptions
of the prevalence of the disease in the general population and anxiety about life in
general. Some people are more anxious about the fate of people located close to their
personal networks while others about more geographically or socially distant groups of
people (i.e. variations in the "amplification" principle proposed by Hume (2000)). This
study suggests that ego-oriented or kin-oriented types of anxieties may be somewhat
different with respect to more broader altruistic ones. Regardless of these orientations,
however, the state of the health system seems to be central foci of concern for most
Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although this study focused on the
psychographics present at the start of the pandemic (March-April 2020), the health
system overload issue is expected to be a central source of anxiety across all stages of the
pandemic in Canada.
Given that collective anxieties are city or region specific, more geographically focused
studies are desirable. It should be noted that the available public version of the CPSSSeries1 survey, regrettably, did not contain provincial or territorial breakdowns and was
limited to individual reporting during the “first” phase of the pandemic. In the "second"
and subsequent phases of the pandemic, shifts in the share of segment composition are
likely to occur. More frequent surveys carried out by Statistics Canada and/or other data
collection agencies may yield, in the future, important information on the common
transitions of individuals from one cluster to another.
In light of the market segmentation findings, what population segments deserve special
attention in terms of public policy? The answer to this question depends on the nature of
the intended public messages and the attitudinal traits of the groups themselves.
Segment 1 and 2 are anxious about the capacity of the Canadian health system to deal
with the human toll of the pandemic while members of segment 4 (inside-bubble
conditions), the most anxious group, are troubled by the fragility of the personal and
household networks and the safety of family and relatives. A higher level of fear and
anxiety often leads to negative outcomes such as mental health deterioration and low
personal efficacy (see for instance the work of Zajacova et. al (2020) with CPSS Series1
data). Overall, all segments including the Outside-Bubble Conditions Anxious, the AngstFree and World Conditions Anxious, need to be targeted by messages empowering
individuals by providing greater information on the different avenues to cope with
infections, the progress in controlling the pandemic and appropriate sanitary guidelines.
