Abstract
Health equity is a persistent issue discussed in academic disciplines. During the COVID19 pandemic, it has become more prominent as inequities emerge across the globe,
impacting the health status of individuals and millions. Mortality remains a central
question, whereas psychosocial challenges may leave deep trauma in communities. In
the digital world, many of those issues could be solved using existing technologies, which
are briefly discussed in this paper. Lastly, specific issues related to such measures are
discussed to inform local research and how they can inform practices to micro to macro
levels of healthcare decision-making.

The psychological impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has
become a matter of global concern (Serafini et al., 2020; Vindegaard & Eriksen Benros,
2020). With ever-increasing social challenges in different contexts, people may have
different levels of psychological responses, which may depend on various factors
including but not limited into the previous mental state, current psychosocial challenges,
psychological resilience, social support, and access to mental health care (M. M. Hossain,
Purohit, et al., 2020; M. Hossain et al., 2020; Vindegaard & Eriksen Benros, 2020). As
COVID-19 has impacted personal, social, and systemic transactions that influence the
psychopathological processes and outcomes, developing effective interventions for
those problems can be profoundly challenging (Mazumder, Hossain, & Das, 2020;
Sultana, Sharma, Hossain, Bhattacharya, & Purohit, 2020).
Global leaders and academicians in the mHealth industry and health systems often
attempt to promote consensus on implementing different standards and principles for
assessing mental health apps such as a) data safety, b) users privacy, c) effectiveness, d)
users adherence, e) data management (Price et al., 2014; Schellong, Lorenz, & Weidner,
2019). These issues are discussed here in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Data safety and privacy are critical concern in the era of misuse of online data from
sources such as email and social media (Agboola, Bates, & Kvedar, 2016; M. M. Hossain
& Hong, 2019; Tasnim, Hossain, & Mazumder, 2020). It is arguable that mental health
apps should ensure that data management practices fulfill industry standards for
handling patient health information. It is necessary that all sensitive health data,
smartphones‐based data,

such as global positioning system (GPS) data, voice,

multimedia data, and overall digital behavior are examined within the scope of digital
mental health in COVID-19. Novel technologies such as AI and blockchain should be
leveraged for advancing digital mental health interventions during this pandemic
(Bhattacharya, Singh, & Hossain, 2019; M. M. Hossain, Sarwar, McKyer, & Ma, 2020; M.
M. Hossain, Sharma, Sultana, Tasnim, & Faizah, 2019; Shi et al., 2020; Vaishya, Javaid,
Khan, & Haleem, 2020).
For COVID-19 affected populations, key decision-makers should agree upon the current
standards for data storage, use, and sharing in domains such as data storage and sharing
policies. These must be made transparent to the users of those platforms. Also, data
shared with external partners, such activities should be clearly discussed so that the use
and sharing plans comply with ethical standards (“Official 2020 HIPAA Compliance
Checklist,” n.d.). The users must have the option to "opt-out" if they do not feel
comfortable, and security reviews and data audits should be conducted to guarantee
that new vulnerabilities are quickly assessed and resolved.
It is widely accepted that mental health problems are very common in a global context.
Generally, they impose a tremendous social burden. A global consideration is needed to
assess the morbidity, quality of life, and mortality associated with those problems that
may exceed our current epidemiological evidence base. There are barriers that prevent
access to mental care treatment. For many people, such a lack of access is aggravated
by the paucity of resources. Vulnerable populations such as immigrants, refugees, victims
of gender-based violence, people with psychiatric comorbidity, or those who are highly
vulnerable to mental health problems should be brought under mental health

interventions (M. M. Hossain, Hasan, Sultana, & Faizah, 2019; M. M. Hossain & Purohit,
2018; M. M. Hossain, Sultana, & Das, 2018; M. M. Hossain, Sultana, et al., 2020;
Vindegaard & Eriksen Benros, 2020). During COVID-19, the scope of mHealth and
eHealth interventions should be carefully examined for better mental health and
wellbeing (Brian & Ben-Zeev, 2014; Cavazos-Rehg et al., 2020; Price et al., 2014).
Digital mental health can be useful in meeting the treatment needs of large populations.
A growing number of clinical trials have shown good outcomes for digital mental health
interventions (Angrish et al., 2020; Cavazos-Rehg et al., 2020; Hong, Hossain, & Chou,
2020; M. M. Hossain, Tasnim, et al., 2019; Price et al., 2014). However, there are a few
examples of implementations that can be seen as failures. These should be assessed to
know how this intervention works and how they can be used in mental health
development in populations. Future research should focus on these issues.
It is recognized that the research-to-practice gap is common in digital mental health as
the inclusion of multiple technologies may create unique issues. It is possible to draw an
outline of some of the reasons for this gap and deploy methods that may result in
sustainable development in the field of digital mental health interventions (Cavazos-Rehg
et al., 2020; Vaishya et al., 2020). However, such knowledge should be investigated
from an evidence-based mental health perspective that includes heterogeneous evidence
from unique population-level sources emphasizing on how multiple stressors or
interventions may mitigate each other.
These methods can be drawn from studies on human-computer interaction that include
artificial intelligence, blockchain, and other technologies. Another issue pertinent to
5|Page

implementation science is how such technologies are integrated into an Accelerated
Creation-to-Sustainment (ACTS) model (LaMonica et al., 2019; Mohr, Lyon, Lattie, Reddy,
& Schueller, 2017). The ACTS model often leverages an iterative process that includes 2
basic functions that focus on design and evaluation across 3 general phases starting
from trials to sustainable adoption. The goal of the ACTS model is to produce a
functioning technology-enabled service (TES) for mental health services that is
sustainable even in the context of the real-world treatment setting (Mohr et al., 2017).
In COVID-19, the researchers may need to identify what evidence can guide intervention
planning. The initial phases, such as the creation phase can result in at least a minimally
viable TES and a blueprint for implementation. In contrast, the Trial phase may require
further evaluation of effectiveness and safety. Research on implementation allowing
optimization and continuous quality improvement of the TES, as well as an
implementation plan, can be profoundly helpful.
Finally, the Sustainment phase involves the withdrawal of research or donor support
while leaving a functioning, continuously improving TES in place (Mohr et al., 2017).
The public mental health impacts in people, such as those with the comorbid condition
can be enormous, which needs to be examined in this pandemic. Innovative models such
as the Tthe ACTS model can be a step toward bringing implementation and sustainability
into the design and evaluation of TESs (LaMonica et al., 2019; Mohr et al., 2017).
Nonetheless, they will impact psychosocial health and broader public health, facilitate
future clinical research, and inform future practices in different unique contexts.

These interventions should be designed from an equity perspective that allows scholars
to identify: what are the factors that may impact the development of psychosocial
interventions in the digital age? Why are some groups more vulnerable, and some are
more privileged? Why technological gaps exist, and how can we solve them in national
and global contexts?
Some of these interventions will take a longer time but those actions are necessary for
advancing psychosocial health in this pandemic. This short article invites more
discussions from the academic community to think what works best in diverse
populations, why the existing technologies are not used to the fullest, how consensus
can be made on reducing psychosocial inequities, and how the collective measures can
mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
