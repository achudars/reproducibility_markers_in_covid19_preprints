Abstract
This review uses host-parasite interactions in nonhuman species to frame the poor US
response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The co-evolutionary interaction between host and
parasite results in changes to hosts that are achieved through genetic evolution but involve
collective information sharing and behavioral adaptation at the colony level. Common
examples are described among ants, bees, and other insects. The US defenses against
SARS-CoV-2 were weakened by malformations in the information ecosystem that disrupted
the dissemination of information while spreading misinformation and disinformation.
Distortions arising from political corruption, and magnified by social media platforms, were
especially consequential. I conclude that this failure may ultimately result in a social
evolution that weakens US global dominance. On the other hand, if the crisis contributes to
innovation and reform in the information ecosystem, that may contribute to a more
egalitarian and democratic system for the production and dissemination of knowledge.

Host, parasite, and failure at the colony level: COVID-19 and the US information ecosystem

1. Introduction
This discussion paper uses host-parasite interactions in nonhuman species to frame
the poor US response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Parasites use host vulnerabilities, and
evolve to modify the behavior of hosts for their own ends. Of particular interest are defenses
at the colony level, adaptations – such as those seen among ants and bees – which I
compare to the responses of different human societies to the current pandemic. Information
flow is vital to host defenses against parasites, occurring at both molecular and social levels,
among nonhumans and humans. The social, or colony, level is where the US was especially
inept, due to its polarization, political corruption, and vulnerabilities to misinformation and
disinformation. An isomorphism between nonhuman and human social response appears in
the importance of information management and dissemination in colony-level defenses
against parasitic infections.

2. Viral volition
Many people imagine the COVID-19 pandemic as a unilateral assault on humanity by
a volitional opponent. Former US President Donald Trump frequently referred to the virus as
an “invisible enemy,” which was “tough and smart” [1] and against which the country was
compelled to wage war [2], a trope President Joe Biden repeated [3]. Journalist Ed Yong
wrote that the virus had “humbled and humiliated the planet’s most powerful nation” [4].
This is consistent with naïve narratives of evolution in which whole species are actors in
their own stories, seeking to gain advantage through adaptation over generations – an
understandable but also misleading cognitive device for representing change over
evolutionary time, especially in the case of viruses. There is no simple way to visualize the
uncountable, genetically distinct viruses that are generating massive experimental trials at
the molecular level, in which success or failure drives their evolution although they are not
really alive, at least insofar as (like advanced computer viruses or cultural memes) they lack
any metabolism of their own [5–8]. Viruses are volitional like molecules of water filtering

through sand under the force of gravity – they make progress, individually and collectively,
without exerting the will to do so. As with the viruses penetrating computer networks,
biological viruses succeed against humans by taking advantage of vulnerabilities in our
individual immune systems as well as in our social behavior, such as population density,
interpersonal interaction, and travel. In their evolutionary trials, viruses test their hosts at
both the individual level and the colony level, finding more hospitable host environments
among some groups of the species than others.
Throughout the world of biological ecosystems, viruses and other parasites co-evolve
with host species, resulting in genetic changes among both host and parasite. One key
pathway to success for parasites involves compelling or cajoling potential hosts to modify
themselves in ways favorable to the parasite’s spread. The co-evolutionary interaction
between host and parasite results in changes to the host that may be defensive adaptations
or humiliating capitulations, or both at once. Common examples are found among ants,
bees, and other insects, as we will see. But this also includes humans who, for example,
cough and sneeze when we get respiratory viruses, which is both a successful programming
of host behavior by viruses as well as a useful survival reaction by individual hosts. In
insects this plays out through genetics over many generations. Humans have the capacity to
change our behavior systematically much more rapidly – for better or worse – within a
generation. Beyond evaluating social responses in terms of success or failure to suppress
the virus, we might also ask whether SARS-CoV-2 is changing human social behavior in ways
that actually promote its spread, and whether the United States is an example of relative
parasite victory in such a contest.

3. Host-parasite contests
As Table 1 illustrates, parasitic attacks trigger responses and defenses at both the
individual and the colony (or collective) level, and at the biological and social levels.
Although useful, the conceptual distinctions between these levels may be arbitrary and not
firmly demarcated. Consider some non-human examples. Rabies is a virus that exists in
most of the world, and manages to kill about 59,000 people per year [9] – mostly in Africa,
Asia, and India – despite not being well suited to targeting humans, who are generally dead-

ends for rabies infection (not passing the virus to others). The virus benefits from variable
and lengthy incubation and infectious periods (up to 6 months), which allow it spread
vertically through births as well as horizontally from migration. But rabies is best known for
having evolved an impressive behavioral manipulation of its hosts, causing them to become
aggressive. Having infected the central nervous system (thus unlocking behavior), it then
launches into “centrifugal spread to major exit portals, the salivary glands” [10]. The
infected hosts, foaming at the mouth, transmit the virus to their victims through bites,
resulting in new infections.

Table 1. Levels of interaction with, and adaptation to, parasitic attacks

Rabies alters individual behavior, but does not obviously change the behavior of
subsequent generations of uninfected individuals, or of groups of individuals, maybe
because it doesn’t threaten whole populations. However, many species of arthropods have
evolved in conjunction with highly customized species of fungi in the genus cordyceps,
mostly in jungles [11]. In one chilling scenario, infected leaf cutter ants abandon their work
assignments and instead climb upward, before latching onto a plant in a death grip that
lasts for several weeks, during which time a stalk grows from their heads and explodes with
new spores. (The process has been popularized through videos such as one from the BBC
[12].) Such phenotypic manipulation by parasites, “causing infected hosts to act in ways that
benefit the parasite” [13], also include the crickets (Nemobius sylvestris) who are driven to
seek water after being infected by hairworms (Paragordius tricuspidatus) that use the hosts
both as a food source and then as transportation back to the water, where they extrude from
the cricket and breed.

These are examples of one type of what Richard Dawkins’ called the “extended
phenotype,” which entails “parasite genomes controlling host behavior” [14]. Natural
selection of gene modifications among the parasites is based on changes achieved in the
hosts’ behavior or gene expression [15]. Although both organisms evolve together, the
relationship is usually one-sided: “the parasite’s genes almost always evolve faster and tend
to call the shots, whereas the host is usually restricted to damage limitation” [16].
Although such relationships are not symbiotic, changes made to limit damage from
parasites may have other benefits for hosts, involving evolved collective action that
sometimes appears altruistic at the individual level. One well known example is the practice
of social grooming (or allogrooming), which reduces infection by parasites (such as lice and
ticks) [17], in addition to its social functions [18]. The social benefits must be balanced with
the costs in terms of infection risk incurred from living in groups [19].
Beyond individual cooperation, the social immunity achieved by many insect species
involves more extensive, multigenerational cooperation to protect the group from infection,
using behavioral and physiological means, and requiring the “complex integration of
information” to accomplish [20]. Evolutionary selection at the level of the colony feeds back
through the genomes of individuals in the species, including those who experience no
individual (reproductive) benefit from their role in collective adaptation [21].
Many insect species have evolved such “social immunity” [22]. Ants in particular
have elaborate defense mechanisms against cordyceps [23]. They limit the number of
foragers sent out from the colony. They avoid eating infected corpses. Their territorial
defenses help prevent infection from other colonies. They dump infected bodies separately.
They groom each other to remove spores. They socially isolate garbage workers. Other cases
of social immunity include the practice of “social fevers” among honey bees, in which the
colony gathers to raise its collective temperature to ward off a colonial infection [24]; and
the secretion of antimicrobial chemicals by paper wasps [25], termites [26], and bark
beetles [27], which involve expending energy for the protection of future generations.
(Paradoxically, infectious microbes may also display social immunity, defined more broadly.
For example, some bacteria acquire antibiotic resistance socially, and by modifying their
host medium improve the survival of others that are not themselves resistant [28].)

As noted, the battle for behavioral control within host species is unbalanced, playing
out over generations, with parasites having shorter generations and evolving more quickly
[29]. This is painfully apparent with regard to humans and the viruses they host. If this is a
series of wars, then successful adaptations by human are not victories but temporary
respites. If the tendency to cough when humans get a respiratory infection enhances
individual survival, being a species that coughs also makes us attractive for future invasions
by viruses that cause respiratory infections. Human physiology evolves slowly against a
constant stream of newly mutated viruses. Our social response, by comparison, is much
nimbler – for better or worse. In short, resistance to parasitic attack is a collective and
multigenerational affair in addition to an individual struggle for survival, and the lines
between categories of interaction are not rigidly fixed.

4. SARS-CoV-2 in the USA
Among respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 has a disease course well-suited to promoting
human transmission, especially its relatively long incubation period (which facilitates
infection by travelers), a viral shedding peak that coincides with symptom onset (which
makes detecting contagious cases difficult) [30], and transmission by asymptomatic (or
presymptomatic) carriers [31]. The last of these – especially among young adults – has
presented a formidable challenge for public health messaging, which seeks to motivate
people with no symptoms and relatively low risk for serious disease to comply with costly
behavioral changes for the benefit of others [32].
Although COVID-19 has been a global pandemic, it has taken a unique course in the
United States, where transmission and death rates at the national level surged ahead of
peer-income countries in the spring of 2020, and ended the year with cumulative per-capita
confirmed infection rates 2.4-times the average for countries with incomes of $30,000 or
higher per person (Figure 1).

Figure 1. COVID-19 confirmed new infection rates per capita in countries with $30,000
(PPP) or higher per capita annual income, by date: March 2020 through January 2021.
Countries shown (population 12 million+) include Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain, USA, United
Kingdom. Countries not shown (N=33) are included in Others. Data from the John Hopkins
University COVID-19 dashboard and the World Bank.

Some distinctive features of the US as a host environment are worth noting. Because
the virus is transmitted through personal contact, the proximate cause of SARS-CoV-2
transmission is the failure to maintain adequate physical or spatial separation between
infected and uninfected people. Within a community, infection occurs when infected people
move around without staying a safe distance from others [33], or if there are not adequate
barriers between them (principally masks) [34]. In the US, this occurred on a large scale in
nursing facilities [35], some kinds of factories [36], prisons [37], and social events [38].
Between communities, the virus spreads by people traveling from place to place [39]. There
is evidence from China [40], Italy [41], and the US [42] that severe restriction in people’s
movements both within and between communities was essential for containing the
epidemic – something the US did not effectively do. The high rate of transmission, infection,
and mortality in the US compared with other similar societies reflects more movement
(within and between regions) and social interaction among the public (as the result of fewer

closures of public institutions and spaces), and less consistent use of protective facemasks.
(The role of genetic variants is not yet established.) Preceding the hoped-for vaccination
program completion, successful response to the epidemic requires communicating and
acting upon public health messages at the individual and collective level.

5. Social information
Several existing vulnerabilities in the US stand out for potentially reducing the
capacity to generate the public health compliance necessary to change behavior in
protective ways. These may include relatively weak science education1, low investment in
public health infrastructure2 [45], distrust in scientific authority that correlates with political
partisanship [46–48], and political polarization [49]. Here I will focus on one issue:
malformations in the information ecosystem that disrupt the dissemination of valuable
information and encourage misinformation and disinformation.
In any species- or colony-level defense against an attacking parasite, information is
vital, whether at the molecular level of the organism’s immune system, or in the social
system – as we saw with ants, bees, and other insects, whose colony responses require
rapid communication. The human response to SARS-CoV-2 relied on unprecedented data
sharing and analysis within the global scientific community, from the initial sharing of the
virus genome [50] to the dissemination of epidemiological information through international
organizations and public health authorities [51] to genomic surveillance of emerging
variants in the pandemic [52]. And scientists shared their reports in preprint form, freely, by
the thousands [53]. Of course, if technology makes possible sharing the data and
knowledge necessary to combat a pandemic, it also facilitates the rapid population
movements that generate global disease spread as well, so the net effect is an information
arms race – as occurs in countless cases across biological ecosystems.

The US ranked 13 out of 37 OECD countries on the PISA Science exam in the latest data. Among
the countries with higher scores (Estonia, Japan, Finland, Korea, Canada, Poland, New Zealand,
Slovenia, United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, and the Netherlands), all had lower per capita GDP in
2018 [43].
2 Funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which rose 20 percent from 2014 to a
peak of $8.3 billion in the fiscal year 2018, was subsequently cut 8% over the next two years [44].

In the human response, however, the US lagged the information generation and
dissemination efforts of peer countries, leading to poor outcomes at the societal (colony)
level. The US system fell behind in testing for the infection in the population, in genetic
monitoring for virus variants [54,55], and in other areas such as material procurement
[56,57]. Unequal and inadequate access to healthcare also set back societal defenses, as
in the case of prisons and jails, from which inmates who had been inadequately protected
emerged to transmit the virus to their home communities [58]. Although these problems
undermined public health efforts, distortions arising from the political system may have
been even more consequential.
After the end of the Trump Administration, Deborah Birx, President Trump’s White
House coronavirus response coordinator, told an interviewer:
“The worst possible time you can have a pandemic is in a presidential election year …
When you have a pandemic where you're relying on every American to change their
behavior, communication is absolutely key. And so every time a statement was made
by a political leader that wasn't consistent with public health needs, that derailed our
response” [59].
The editor-in-chief of Science Holden Thorp, reflected: “American science denialism
… persists, even at the highest level of leadership, with a president who denies climate
change and a vice president—a devout creationist—who believes that Earth is only 6000
years old” [60]. The political right, led by President Trump and his associates [61], who were
primarily concerned with his reelection chances, was able to use an existing anti-science
movement infrastructure and media organizations that had been developed as a bulwark
against policies to mitigate climate change [62].
The need for clear public health information and communication collided with the
political project of President Trump. Authoritarian leaders have historically adopted the
mission of discrediting science not so much because of specific issues, but because
undermining truth and reason itself creates a vacuum they hope to fill with loyalty to the
national leader. As philosopher Jason Stanley writes: “Regular and repeated lying is part of
the process by which fascist politics destroys the information space. A fascist leader can
replace truth with power, ultimately lying without consequence” [63].

Under the example set by the president, the political right used social media to
generate an “infodemic” [64], using unregulated social media platforms designed to amplify
echo-chamber information dynamics and promote polarization [65]. The existing health
disinformation and conspiracy theory networks quickly retooled to disseminate
disinformation about COVID-19 [66]. In the process, the platforms saw rapidly rising market
value -- Facebook stock rose 31% in value, and Twitter rose 72%, over the year 2020, even
as they served pandemic disinformation to hundreds of millions of users. Wide swaths of the
US social milieu were primed to distort incoming information in ways that undermine public
health: “Users online tend to acquire information adhering to their worldviews, to ignore
dissenting information and to form polarized groups around shared narratives” [64]. The
conspiracy infrastructure built on social media platforms provided the receptacles onto
which the infodemic virus could latch.
After the election, science-denial continued as a dominant theme in the political
movement Trump led. One anecdote illustrates the strategy to sow doubt about scientific
expertise itself, creating a knowledge vacuum that extends beyond specific public health
issues. When White House chief medical advisor Anthony Fauci publicly recommended
doubling up cotton facemasks, Representative Jim Jordan, a member of the House
Republican leadership with 1.8 million Twitter followers, tweeted, “First, it was don’t wear a
mask. Then, it was wear a mask. Now? Wear two masks! What’s next? Shopping in plastic
bubbles?”[67]. President Trump had declared Jordan “an inspiration to freedom-loving
Americans everywhere,” and awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom [68].

6. Conclusion
One question raised by this fact pattern is whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus not only
capitalized on US society’s existing vulnerabilities, but also successfully modified US social
behavior in ways that exacerbated those weaknesses. In other words, if evolutionary
interchanges in biological ecosystems have caused raccoons to become aggressive and
spread rabies, and ants to desert their posts to spread fungal spores, did SARS-CoV-2 –
acting through social rather than genetic evolutionary means – corrupt US social behavior in

ways that make the society a more hospitable host, and therefore spreader, of the virus?
This question is necessarily speculative.
The relationship between humanity and SARS-CoV-2 is unfolding as an iterative
sequence of interactions across time and social space. Examining this kind of process in
biological ecosystems may hold useful lessons for human society. Millions of viruses “try” to
penetrate the human immune system, and those that are successful take advantage of key
aspects of our social behavior. But they are also tested at the colony (or societal) level,
finding some host environments more hospitable than others. Respiratory viruses are
expected to succeed in crowded places, such as Wuhan or Delhi and São Paolo or New York
City. However, among the wealthy societies SARS-CoV-2 has thrived especially well in the
United States, partly because of deficient and corrupt information management and
dissemination systems. In fact, the virus may have trained the US to exacerbate its own
weaknesses with regard to the information system.
Table 2 offers a schematic illustration of the comparisons drawn out in this review.
Common information dynamics may be seen across nonhuman and human contexts (A).
These include the use of information at the individual and social levels, and defenses
implemented among individuals as well as colonies – including those with individual
reproductive versus (or in addition to) social benefits. Among humans (B), parasites (in this
case a respiratory virus) generate behavioral responses at the individual level that, while
protecting individuals, also help the virus spread. I have suggested, but cannot prove, that
the deficient US response of political polarization around public health information and
behavior, may reflects an analogous process. In any event, a successful response requires
both individual and social adaptation, and these in turn are conditioned by the information
system context. When individuals have adequate science education, receive current
information, and trust the authorities that offer advice, they are more successful at resisting
infection. That, in turn, may require a social context in which information is equitably
distributed and democratically deployed, generate adequate social trust – including an open
science environment [69].

Humans have a great capacity to adapt and react, evolving much faster socially than
biologically – within a lifetime rather than over many generations – partly because we can
study how other species adapt over evolutionary time (e.g., how ants fight fungi or bees fight
viruses). And we also have the benefit of learning from variation across historical and spatial
contexts, so that we can make collective decisions to change our behavior systematically to
generate collective defenses. In addition to law and regulation, healthcare, and travel
restrictions, a key aspect of this defense occurs in the information ecosystem: public health
and science communication. This requires communicating good information, resisting the
spread of disinformation, and generating scientific scholarship that is efficient as well as
trustworthy. In this respect, a notably successful adaptation has been the acceleration of
scientific research dissemination and its democratization on free preprint servers [53] (a
development of the global scientific community rather than a US-specific innovation). To the

extent the US fails to rise to this challenge, the result may be seen in a social evolution that
weakens US dominance around the world (see, for example, China’s much more rapid
economic recovery during the pandemic [70]). If the crisis contributes to innovation and
reform in the information ecosystem, on the other hand, the result may be not just better
defense against this or subsequent biological pandemics, but also a more egalitarian and
democratic system for the production and dissemination of knowledge [71].
