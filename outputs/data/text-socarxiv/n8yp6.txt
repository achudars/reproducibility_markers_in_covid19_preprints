ABSTRACT

Background: Significant knowledge about long-term symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection has
been produced by patients, which made Long Covid.
Objective: To document and analyse such knowledge, outline how it changed understanding of COVID-19,
and specify ethical and socio-political challenges associated with its development.
Methods: Analysis of publicly available materials on Long Covid by people with Long Covid, largely in
English and Italian, and across media and genre.
Results: Those with Long Covid have made epistemic contributions across multiple media, including: oral,
written and visual narratives, testimonies and arguments; quantitative and qualitative research; grey literature,
essays, opinion pieces and commentaries; and advocacy and policy interventions.

Discussion: Patient knowledge contributed to shifting assumptions concerning COVID-19 symptoms and
disease pathways; phasing and duration; classification and naming of illness; disease morbidity; and who is
affected. Patients’ use of a wide range of media challenged the conventional scientific production of
epistemic claims. Many ethical and political challenges lie ahead, including exploitation of patients, their
knowledge, and their data.
Conclusions: Long Covid patient activism and research have been instrumental to key epistemic shifts that
have changed understandings of COVID-19. They have also changed – possibly permanently – how
science and medical knowledge are produced. Patient expertise must be routinely integrated into medicine
beyond the current pandemic. We also need to ensure the ethical use of patient-led expertise and patientproduced data in Long Covid.
Patient contribution: Both authors are patients and researchers with Long Covid, who have contributed to
making ‘Long Covid', and to advocacy around its definition and recognition.

Introduction
On 21 August 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) met Long Covid advocates and experts at a
landmark private meeting, which led to official recognition of long-term, debilitating COVID-19 symptoms.1,2
Closing the meeting, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General, re-quoted part of one patient
group’s presentation back to assembled advocates: ‘with patient-led research and patient-led activism, it appears
that patients are writing the first textbook on long covid’.1 Nearly nine months after China reported the outbreak
of a novel coronavirus to the WHO, the WHO acknowledged the central role of patient expertise in relation to
COVID-19. We argue here – by qualitatively analysing shifts regarding conceptualisations and symptoms of
COVID-19 – that patients’ epistemic contributions have extended beyond writing the ‘first textbook on long
covid’. They have: (i) helped reshape assumptions about COVID-19; (ii) contributed new knowledge about
COVID-19; and (iii) changed, possibly permanently, how knowledge is produced about a novel disease.
What is Long Covid?
‘Long Covid’ is the term collectively made by patients to describe long-term symptoms and sequelae following
symptom onset clinically suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection.3 Patients, the vast majority of whom endured a
new disease outside of in-patient hospital settings, set up support groups and initiated campaigns for care and
recognition worldwide. ‘Long-haulers’ (a term introduced by patient Amy Watson)4 and ‘long-haul Covid’
circulated widely across patients and media reports and have also been used by clinician scientists.5 Cognate
term ‘Long Covid’ was first used on Twitter, as a hashtag, in May 2020 by Elisa Perego from Lombardy.6
Perego used it as a contraction of long-term Covid illness, which engaged with her own experience of a cyclical,
multiphasic, and multi-system condition. #longcovid became an increasingly prominent hashtag – initially used
by patients and then by many others – and ‘Long Covid’ rapidly moved from social media into other domains. It
subsequently appeared in scientific journal articles by conventional (non-patient) researchers:: first, within the
text’s main body;7,8 later, directly in titles.9 Published studies increasingly recognize long-term COVID-19
symptoms and sequelae in a significant percentage of survivors.10,11 While the fine-grained mechanism(s)
driving long-term symptoms need(s) further investigation, protracted immune responses and autoimmunity are
suspected, multiple sequelae in many organs are now reported, and several secondary mechanisms might be
involved.12,13
The alacrity and extent of take-up of the term Long Covid – first by patients and, subsequently, by
many others – demonstrates its effectiveness and ability to resonate with patients’ experiences and to describe a
new illness whose time course and mechanism(s) remain poorly understood. We document, in Section I, how
patient knowledge surrounding ‘Long Covid’ was instrumental to epistemic shifts regarding COVID-19. Our
phrase ‘patient knowledge’ encompasses multidimensional forms of such knowledge – which range from
experiential knowledge (which can contribute to conceptual advances, hypothesis development, data
interpretation, and ways of living), to full scale patient-led research projects.14–17 In Section II, we discuss the
production and use of patient knowledge regarding Long Covid, highlighting ethical and socio-political risks
ahead.

Our analytic paper engages with extensive materials produced by those with Long Covid. We both have Long
Covid, and have contributed to the making of this patient-made term, as well as advocacy around Long Covid’s
definition and recognition.3,18 The paper draws on our analysis of fast-moving debates and research across
different media, research institutions, and policy spaces. In view of language constraints, we largely focus on
English and Italian materials. Since falling ill with COVID-19 in early 2020, we have followed and contributed
to discussions across various media, and conducted regular database searches in both journals and newspapers to
locate material on Long Covid/long-haul Covid. We distilled our material into themes that orient our subsections below, which we combine with conceptual and ethical reflections. These reflections draw on what we
have experienced in the course of the pandemic, as well on our expertise in health research, from Long Covid to
patient-/service user-led research.19,20 Our selection of specific examples, below, is linked to our ethical
commitment to ensuring that we were able to acquire explicit permission from any person from whom we
reference published materials or knowledge that we consider sensitive (into this category we place publicly
available social media posts and personal communications).
1.

Patient knowledge

Patient contributions are individually, collectively, and anonymously authored; most have emerged through
collective sharing with other patients experiencing long-term symptoms and sequelae. A non-exhaustive list of
contributions across multiple media includes: oral, written and visual narratives, testimonies and arguments;
quantitative and qualitative research; grey literature, essays, opinion pieces and commentaries; and advocacy
and policy interventions.
1.1

Multiple symptoms and disease pathways

2020 witnessed, Sharrona Pearl has argued, the emergence of a ‘new genre of writing…: the Covid-19
symptoms thread’.21 Through this new genre, those with COVID-19 provided early, rich ‘self-generated
symptomatolog[ies]’21 of a new disease, which are themselves evidence of a distinctive kind of illness
narrative.22 Threads – such as for example one by Dani Oliver23 – elaborated COVID-19’s multi-systemic nature
ensuring that patients helped broaden the focus beyond the pulmonary system, which was dominant in public
messaging early in the pandemic. Another widely circulated thread and newspaper column by Fern Riddell,
from April, emphasized her ‘purely gastric’ rather than pulmonary symptoms;24,25 another thread and newspaper
article by Hannah Davis in July described symptoms affecting multiple organs, including the brain.26,27 Patientmade films from Spain and the UK profiled patients holding placards that documented vast, variable arrays of
symptoms affecting multiple organs from heart to skin.28,29 The films made visible an emergent cohort for whom
care, investigation and research was urgently needed, while giving solidity to both shared and heterogeneous
symptomatologies.
A survey by an all-patient team from the Body Politic Support Group, published in May 2020,
comprised the first research which addressed the complexity of long-term symptoms, and collected quantitative
and qualitative data.30 The same team subsequently established itself as a formal research unit (Patient Led
Research for COVID-19) and produced findings in December from a large-scale research survey describing the
development of 205 multi-system symptoms across seven months.31 The ontology of COVID-19 itself, is, we
emphasise, currently multiple: its nature remains, in part, mysterious. While first characterized as a respiratory

3

disease, and named as such, by April 2020, COVID-19 was being conceiving as a systemic or endothelial
disease.32 As the persistent form(s) and/or sequela(e) of a still poorly understood disease, Long Covid, patients
stressed from early pandemic months, is likely to incorporate multiple conditions precipitated by SARS-CoV2.33 Many patients offered speculations and hypotheses based on careful observation of their own symptoms,34,35
on comparisons with others and with materials emerging from scientific research,36 and on the effects of selfadministered medication, such as aspirin and antihistamines,37 which are now objects of research by
conventional scientists.38,39 Some, such as Angela Meriquez, argued for the potential role of mast cell activation,
dysautonomia, autoimmunity, cytokine release and complex cardiovascular damage.40,41 Patients also stressed
the importance of tackling persistent organ impairment and tissue inflammation.42,43 Many of these phenomena
are now addressed in publications in scientific journals.44–47 Patients often cemented the plausibility of their
hypotheses by pointing to emerging research indicating cardiovascular, respiratory, kidney, neurological,
autoimmune, and endothelial sequelae.44,48 They shared results of their own medical tests on various platforms,
asked medical providers for specific examinations, and made calls to conventional research communities.1,33
These have prompted subsequent research on Long Covid symptoms and sequelae, as well led to collaborations
with conventional researchers.49 These include issues – such as eye, menstruation and arthritis-like problems –
which have been common amongst Long Covid patient communities, but were not visible in public discussions
or peer-reviewed articles in the first pandemic months. The patient-making of Long Covid, then, not only
provided early, complex symptomatologies, but contributed to revisioning SARS-CoV-2’s range of damage,
emphasized the need to keep in sight all potential sequelae, and offered hypotheses and speculations as regards
disease mechanism(s) and potential therapeutics.
1.2

Phasing, tempo, duration

Perego’s use of #longcovid intended to complicate the bi-phasic disease model that characterized some early
accounts. In late March 2020, for example, Lescure et al. described a milder prodromal stage followed by
interstitial pneumonia in the second week from onset, with a peak in severity between the tenth to twelfth day.50
Patient interventions rendered this timeline more complex51,52 – underlining the possibility of temporal patterns
in disease cycles and progression, an intensification of symptoms in weeks 4-5, the movement of symptoms to
different organs over time, delayed peaks from onset, multiple relapses across several months, and symptom
intensification in relation to triggers such as activity or periods.37,53–55 These hypotheses are now being
increasingly substantiated by research publications.46,56,57 Patient Led’s first survey showed already in May that
~90% of respondents had symptoms fluctuating in intensity and frequency, and pointed to certain symptoms
returning in cyclical ways.30 These findings were expanded in Patient Led’s larger research survey from
December 2020.31 Individual patients frequently made visible the day (or month) of their symptom report – e.g.
Day 129, month 10.5 – on social or other media. This further underlined the persistence, heterogeneity, and
complex time course of symptoms. In broadening the temporal scope particularly of ‘mild’ COVID-19, patients
indicated the urgent need for careful natural histories that focused beyond the first few weeks from onset. That
multiple patients have persisted in documenting publicly symptoms many months after onset brought attention
to the significant absence of monitoring – particularly for early cohorts – and the urgent need for improvements.
The term ‘Long Covid’ further allowed patients to foreground that the point at which COVID-19
moves from an acute to a post-acute phase remains unclear, as do duration and final outcomes.33 Patients

4

insisted that the duration of viral persistence is not yet fully understood. Evidence of viral persistence extending
in some cases beyond the first few days from onset has subsequently peen published in peer-reviewed articles.58
Patients also underlined that more research is required on the complex interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and
the host immune system – with particular regard to phenomena such as potential autoimmunity, immune
misfiring and/or persistent immune activation taking place after 30-40 days from onset and/or hospital
discharge. Such phenomena remain poorly documented because of lack of long-term patient monitoring, but are
now gaining increasing consideration thanks to the first longitudinal immunological studies.46 Prior to formal
publications, those with Long Covid also undertook citizen science projects on immune response to SARSCoV-2: Gez Medinger, for example, gathered and analysed antibody test results from long-hauler Facebook
groups to explore hypotheses regarding potential differences in immune reactions.59 Open interactions between
patients and scientists have been instrumental in fostering new Long Covid research – such as immunological
research by Akiko Iwasaki, which required blood samples from those with Long Covid.60
1.3

Disease classification

In outlining the complex time-course of Long Covid, patients challenged dominant public assumptions, built on
early formal reports from Wuhan, which proposed recovery for ‘mild disease’ within two weeks.61 Early
classifications of COVID-19 were made along the single axis of disease severity (dividing into mild, severe, and
critical). COVID-19 was assumed to be a respiratory disease: classification was largely based around
pneumonia severity and the potential to develop respiratory and/or multi-organ failure within the first month.61,62
Long Covid made clear how this categorisation does not do justice to heterogeneous disease trajectories and the
gravity of on-going reduction in functioning and quality of life. Patients took apart the ‘mild’ – emphasizing
how difficult it is to adjudicate severity when many serious sequelae can occur at different stages of illness –
and raised the likelihood that ‘mild’ COVID-19 might be too capacious as a category to be helpful for clinical
decision-making (given that 80% of patients were said to fall into this category in early reports).63,64 Mild,
patients emphasised, is a term that downplays the often profound consequences of infection, and therefore is
unlikely to have ‘face validity’ for many. It is also unhelpful for public health messaging – given mild’s bland
connotations.
Such arguments also made clear that hospitalization is an imperfect indicator of severity, even if it was
commonly used both as a standard for access to many post-Covid clinics and as a threshold criterion in many
studies. Criteria for hospital admission has varied from country to country, and within countries: in some hardhit countries not all patients in need of urgent medical attention have been hospitalized or treated.65–67
Hospitalized patients had access to treatments, such as oxygen, antibiotics or steroids, which might have
prevented some damage from COVID-19. Medication might have, in addition, altered the natural progression of
the disease – or at least its symptomatology – thereby making hospitalized patients different from those who
have been recovering at home with limited access to medication and care. Patients noted – for example during a
forum on Long Covid in December 2020 – that some hospitalized patients with more serious early symptoms
appeared to have fared better than others with ‘mild’ illness, potentially because of early access to care or
differences in disease trajectory; this issue is increasingly addressed by medical professionals.68
Patient-made Long Covid, therefore, made clear that key issues such as symptom duration, daily life
disruptions and functional impairment had not yet adequately been addressed when adjudicating severity. Any

5

revisions to current COVID-19 classifications, and/or any formal classification of ‘Long Covid’ and potential
future subdivisions require, we argue, the involvement of multiple patients in conceptualizing severity and
suffering, as well as analysis of diverse disease pathways and divergent access to care and medical intervention
across disease course.
1.4

Naming a new illness

The patient-made name ‘Long Covid’ is itself a significant epistemological contribution.69 Long Covid centred
patient knowledge about COVID-19 while attempting to navigate the discriminatory or reductionist valence that
may become attached to terms such as ‘chronic’ or 'syndrome'.18 ‘Long’ is intentionally different from the more
familiar medical adjective ‘chronic': with its simple assertion of a ‘long’ temporal trajectory, Long Covid carries
its history of having disrupted early assumptions about the ‘shortness’ of 'mild' COVID-19. By focusing on
tempo and uncertain timeline, Long Covid also draws attention to the dynamic nature of the disease, as well as
to developments and progressions in disease course, which are now evidenced in at least some subsets of
COVID-19 patients in the short and long term, and widely addressed in patient fora and on social media.
Chronic, on the other hand, remains anchored to the dyad acute–chronic, which may serve to make suffering
invisible by occluding the structural forces that are often of far greater importance than biomedical reasons for
the production and maintenance of illness and suffering.70 Long Covid, therefore, is proactive in asking for
investigation and appropriate care. When aetiology is not understood for lack of investigation, or symptoms not
widely recognized or reported, ‘chronic’ and 'syndrome, particularly when attached to illnesses that have
become gendered in particular ways, can make it more difficult to receive care.71 Many patients’ agnosticism
regarding the point at which a ‘post-viral’, convalescent or post-COVID phase begins,18 has intensified their
disagreement with the emerging terminology of ‘post-Covid syndrome’, preferred in certain formal medical
channels.72 While some phenomena linked to COVID-19, such as pneumonia, may peak early and fully resolve,
significant events, including hospitalization and death, are now reported later in the disease course.73 Long
Covid, therefore acknowledges the complex interaction and development of multiple symptoms and timelines
across disease development.
That ‘Long Covid’ was created collectively also intervenes in relation to a wider history of naming
diseases. That history involves the gradual dissolution, in the twentieth century, of eponymous naming whereby
a singular – usually white male – scientist and/or medical professional came to be honoured. The history of
naming diseases also includes terms that have been argued by those living under them to be stigmatizing,
discriminatory and unhelpful both therapeutically and in relation to public health (e.g. borderline personality
disorder, chronic fatigue syndrome, ‘swine flu’).74,75 The WHO, in its document outlining best practices for
naming new infectious diseases, presents as key principles the use of generic (e.g. respiratory disease), plain and
specific (e.g. juvenile, severe), and short terms.76 Long Covid satisfies many of these principles. It does,
however, specifically depart from the suggested terms for time course: the WHO suggests using ‘[a]cute, subacute, chronic, progressive, transient’. ‘Long’ does not impose an end (‘post’) nor implies chronicity; it does not
divide the illness into COVID-19 and what comes after. It draws attention to the need to understand early
disease mechanisms, and the importance of early intervention, and timely care. The history of medicine shows

6

that how diseases are named and classified, and the models used to investigate them, significantly shape how
patients are supported, and the gravity with which suffering is acknowledged and treated. As a patient-made
term that gained consistency in just a few weeks against all odds, Long Covid asks for patient expertise and
lived experience to be at the forefront of disease research and definition.
1.5

Morbidity

In the early pandemic months, mortality dominated COVID-19 discourse. Discussions amongst ‘long-haulers’
insisted, in contrast, that morbidity is just as crucial – both for those already suffering, and to re-orient policymaking that, through ignoring morbidity, carries the risk of massive social and healthcare burden in the future.
Those with Long Covid used various tactics to emphasise the significant personal, economic and social costs of
long-term symptoms and sequelae. Public health doctor, Nisreen Alwan, who has Long Covid, initiated the
social media campaign #CountLongCovid to emphasize the urgent need for proper case definitions of recovery;
standardized methods of collecting data; and large, population-based samples, preferably gathered through
surveillance.64,77–79 Many patients amplified the #CountLongCovid campaign by testifying to their changed
lives. For example, in September 2020, a Tweet by Talya Varga, which developed into a long thread, combined
the hashtag #CountLongCovid with the phrase ‘Six months ago’ and photographs from people’s pre-Covid (and
sometimes post-Covid) life to mark the debilitating effects of infection half a year on, which left many confined
to their bed and/or requiring a wheelchair.80 Those with Long Covid wrote with great sensitivity about the
complex experience of, and challenges surrounding, becoming (potentially) disabled.81
1.6

Making children visible

Adults and children with Long Covid worked hard to bring to visibility the existence of children with long-term
symptoms and sequelae. In so doing, they epistemologically intervened by disrupting common assumptions of
how pediatric experiences of COVID-19 were different from those of adults. From the early pandemic months,
we noted how many adults in patient support groups were describing their children’s distressing experience of
persistent symptoms – while this was initially invisible in public commentary. Since then, both adults and
children profiled the complex and multi-systemic character of paediatric Long Covid, and the hashtag
#LongCovidKids has circulated widely.82,83 Frances Simpson presented testimonies from both parents and
children at the August WHO meeting, and conducted an informal patient-led survey across support groups: her
survey demonstrated multiple symptoms, including widespread gastrointestinal difficulties.1,84 As soon as the
Multi-Inflammatory Systemic Disorder (MIS-C) in children was first identified in April 2020,85 patients
speculated that there may be connections between MIS-C and some Long Covid symptoms in adults.86 Evidence
in journals has mounted since April 2020 that both young people and children have symptoms beyond two
weeks; Long Covid in pediatric patients has now been reported by conventional scientists.87 An analogous
disease to MIS-C in adults has also been proposed (MIS-A),88 and increasing scientific attention is now being
devoted to potential relationships between MISC-C and some aspects of Long Covid.89 The epistemic
significance of adults’ and children’s testimonies regarding childhood Long Covid was given further weight in
January 2021 when the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus in the UK held a public hearing on Long
Covid in children.90

7

1.7

Combatting discrimination

Long Covid was born out of collective suffering that, often, was precipitated as much by political and medical
neglect as by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Those with Long Covid have used various tactics and media – see, for
example, Monique Jackson’s illustrated diary ‘Still Ill’91 – to emphasize the centrality of social and political
factors,92 particularly of discrimination (including racism and able-ism), and of inequitable access to times for
rest and recuperation.93 They have articulated how those with Long Covid might best learn from and work in
solidarity with disabled people and those in other patient movements.81 Advocates with Long Covid have
worked collaboratively, for example, with those with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) – co-signing Solve
ME’s letter to Congress, which constituted part of the pressure that resulted in the releasing of $1.15bn in funds
for research on Long Covid and post-viral illnesses.94
Many with Long Covid have challenged the dominant, able-ist framing through which COVID-19 has
often been discussed. Much reporting of COVID-19 mortality singled out those considered ‘healthy’ from those
with ‘underlying conditions’, which strengthens eugenicist logics.95 Many of those who made Long Covid –
including us – have experiences of disability and chronic illness predating COVID-19, experienced
discriminatory practices in relation to accessing care and treatment, and draw on research and models developed
by disability and patient/service user activists and researchers.33 Our own experiences, as well as our
participation in discussion with others with Long Covid, leads us to argue that:
●

disabled people, who are already at higher risk of marginalization, are particularly likely to experience
further abuse and discrimination in relation to access to SARS-CoV-2 testing, treatment, screening,
care and economic support.

●

people who have previously received psychiatric diagnoses are at risk of ‘diagnostic overshadowing’,
whereby their Long Covid symptoms are at greater risk of being interpreted through mental health
lenses, thereby resulting in potential under-recognition of physical symptoms.96

●

many who experience COVID-19 and/or Long Covid – whether or not they were disabled prior to
infection – have found the experience of COVID-19 and lack of care traumatic, and often disabling in
ways that it risks to make damage from SARS-CoV-2 more acute and long lasting.

2.1

Knowledge production during a pandemic
Patient contributions and social media

As patients created, at speed, a new illness, they disrupted conventional scientific modes of doing research,
creating knowledge, gathering and disseminating evidence, and building clinical archives/datasets. Tweets,
Facebook posts, contributions to Slack and WhatsApp groups, patient-led reports and surveys, blogs, opinion
pieces, and conversations between patients preceded the formal generation and dissemination of data about
long-term symptoms and sequelae by conventional researchers, particularly for those not hospitalized. Some of
the largest archives concerning Long Covid symptoms are currently found under hashtags (e.g. #longcovid,
#apresj20), and within private/semi-private patient support groups (e.g. Body Politic COVID-19 Support Group
https://www.wearebodypolitic.com/covid19; Long Covid Support Group
https://www.facebook.com/groups/longcovid/). There have been other instances in which patient collectivities

8

and illness entities have formed through people finding one another through various media.97 However, the
making of Long Covid, because of the sheer pace of its consolidation, the use of particular media platforms like
Twitter, and the novelty of COVID-19, is, we argue, distinctive in certain ways. Different media platforms offer
distinctive affordances in terms of how they encourage the formation of collectivities, consolidate discursive
framings, facilitate particular kinds of affective dynamics, and translate and disseminate text and images. Both
Twitter and other online digital media (e.g. Facebook, Slack) have been important in allowing patients to find
and communicate with one another at times of significant physical restrictions in the form of lockdowns. The
‘self-generated symptomatology’ in the form of Twitter threads, for example, have genre characteristics that are
likely specific to Twitter: this would merit further analysis. Twitter was also key in facilitating the rapid
transmission of #LongCovid to non-patient constituencies with a speed that would have been less likely in less
‘public’ media (e.g. Facebook support groups which predominantly contain patients): the large number of
conversations between those with Long Covid and others (particularly conventional scientists) not only helped
cement the name Long Covid,3 but is likely to have shaped the manner in which patient knowledge of COVID19 has travelled more widely.
Equally important has been the wider pandemic media landscape: publishers’ decisions to make many
COVID-19 papers freely available, as well as the frequent use of pre-prints,98 has meant that a wide range of
patients – though this is highly differentiated in terms of class and geographical location – have been able to
access, share, and discuss scientific materials on multiple platforms ‘in real time’. While the grassroots
movement that made Long Covid has included clinicians and scientists,99 patients without medical credentials –
though with other forms of expertise – have made significant epistemic contributions across multiple fora. The
symptomatology of COVID-19 itself has also been a salient factor: Long Covid was mostly made by those
patients who endured significant, but – crucially – often fluctuating, illness at home. We note that many of those
who were hospitalized, particularly older people, and those who were intubated, might have been too ill, and
without easy access to media platforms, to fully contribute to the epistemic debates. This relative invisibility of
some with Long Covid risks some aspects of Long Covid (e.g. the possibility of lifelong lung and
cardiovascular damage) being downplayed in public perceptions of Long Covid and in clinical fora.
2.2

Ethics and justice

The pandemic has provoked both a political-economic and a public health crisis. Many with Long Covid have
reported difficulties in accessing sick pay and disability benefits, or have lost their jobs while still unwell.100
That many minoritized/marginalized groups have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection at higher rates means
that they are likely to be disproportionately affected by Long Covid. There arise multiple pressing issues of
ethics and social justice. In Table 1, we itemize some likely long-term consequences of Long Covid, and urge
more systematic documentation and addressing of these and comparable issues.
** INSERT TABLE 1 **
** INSERT TABLE 2 **
We are concerned – given our knowledge of social, medical and political responses to previous epidemics and
crisis situations, as well as the ethical issues we have seen arise in the course of our own participation in many

9

discussions amongst those living with Long Covid – about various risks that face those with Long Covid. We
outline some of these risks and their potential effects in Table 2.
In Table 3, we focus on issues that bear specifically on the ability of those living with Long Covid to
make on-going epistemic contributions to COVID-19. These we thematize under three categories: (i) exclusion,
(ii) exploitation and (iii) the consolidation of particular conceptualizations of long-term symptoms. We urge
conventional researchers to give attention to help address and where necessary remedy these problems. We
address three particularly pressing issues in a more detail below:
***INSERT TABLE 3 ***
a) Data and archives: Many with Long Covid are participants in, and owners of, archives now containing
immense quantities of material. These are enormously clinically, sociologically, and politically valuable – as
well as sensitive. Any use of these materials outside of the specific, patient-determined purposes for which they
were founded (largely mutual aid) poses enormous ethical issues. We have participated in conversations from
which we infer that there is a real danger of what we believe would be unjust, unethical and exploitative use of
patient-created data and archives.101 The use of publicly available social media data for research is not exempt
from potential charges of exploitation – especially given that much social data on Long Covid arises from
patients who have been posting while ill and experiencing a life-threatening disease (not all of whom have
survived). There are already indications that some scientists might not be aware of the ethical stakes attached to
the use of patient data. For example, studies of COVID-19 symptomatology, based on social media data, have
already being published with no mention of the ethical stakes of using such data.102,103
b) Acknowledgement of epistemic contributions: As we emphasised, multiple patients have offered
hypotheses, speculations, and observations concerning symptoms, potential mechanisms, potential aetiologies,
potential diagnoses for sequelae, and potential therapeutic agents. These contributions have often been made,
using social media platforms, weeks if not months before their appearance in peer-reviewed articles. Like the
use of 'Long Covid' itself, it is, we believe, very likely that some contributed to conventional scientists’
hypothesis-building, given the extensive discussions regarding Long Covid across patient and scientific
communities online. We urge the scientific community to find ways of acknowledging and giving epistemic
weight to these contributions.
c) Power relations and patient knowledge: While there is increasing evidence of patients’ involvement in
creating knowledge about Long Covid, we know from existing research how difficult it can be for conventional
researchers to acknowledge and epistemically authorise patient contributions.104,105 At the time of writing, efforts
have been made to consolidate long-term COVID-19 symptoms and sequelae as ‘Post Covid syndrome’72 (a
name many patients have contested),69 as well as to commission services and allocate significant funds for
research.106 How epistemic power relations will play out in forthcoming research on Long Covid remains to be
seen – particularly whether the epistemic contributions of patients without clinical credentials, and those subject
to greater levels of societal discrimination, are given weight by conventional actors.

10

Conclusion
Long Covid was collectively created by an international, grassroots movement of people who experienced a
new, frightening and life-threatening disease. Many have undergone traumatic experiences in dramatic
circumstances, which included political abandonment, significant mortality, lockdowns and other forms of
restriction. Many have been denied medical care; many have experienced the fear of dying, untreated, at home;
many have been poorly understood, even by close associates; many have had their symptoms disregarded or
misdiagnosed as anxiety or other medical conditions; many have lost loved ones and are caring for others who
are also ill.107,108 Many have lost – or live with the threat of losing – jobs, livelihoods, healthcare access, or
residency status. Yet, those with long-term symptoms and sequelae have undertaken research, documented
symptoms, built hypotheses, proposed therapeutic interventions, developed ways of living with illness, and
articulated potential clinical and socio-political dangers ahead – in addition to engaging in enormous collective
support, advocacy and activism. These epistemic contributions have helped change COVID-19 – as well as the
trajectory of the pandemic.
The term ‘Long Covid’ moved from a single, rather unremarkable tweet which introduced a new
hashtag (and was initially ‘liked’ only once), to use by the WHO in only three months. Long Covid was created
via the collective circulation on social media of the hashtag #LongCovid: this is far from incidental to how, for
patients, the term has become a means of holding together profound heterogeneity at the same time as insisting
on phenomenological complexity and the need for whole-system approaches. Some of the most vibrant and
detailed documentation and elaboration of long-term symptoms and sequelae – often taking place prior to their
collection and dissemination via conventional scientific studies – have taken place on social and digital media.
Many of these patient contributions would undoubtedly be considered ‘informal’ or ‘anecdotal’ according to
formalized hierarchies of scientific evidence,109,110 since many have used media, channels, genres, and methods
of observation that fall outside those through which epistemic authority in science and policy making tend to be
built (e.g. blogs, surveys or polls that fall outside of research institutions’ specified frameworks, illustrated
diaries, first-person accounts, patient-made films). They, therefore, risk being ignored, disregarded, or not
known about. We also note the enormous number of epistemic contributions that have been made in private fora
that are known only to patients in those fora.
We brought greater epistemic solidity to these contributions, so as to open out more broadly the
different kinds of evidence that patients contribute in the face of wholly new phenomena. They form a new and
notable chapter in the long-history of patient-made knowledge about health and illness.111,112 Patient knowledge
made a new illness – caused by an entirely new infectious pathogen. Patients have offered multiple
characterizations of its symptomatology, speculations concerning its pathways and mechanisms, and ways of
dealing with its difficulties – many of which occurred prior to the publication of peer-reviewed research. We
note the short temporal span within which patient knowledge, combined with patient advocacy, has been able to
influence the epistemic horizons of stakeholders, including researchers, clinicians, and governments, at a
moment in which epistemic frameworks governing COVID-19 are still in formation. This poses complex
questions – both conceptual and empirical – concerning how patients individually and collectively contribute
knowledge, how patients’ epistemic work in relation to Long Covid differ from patients’ epistemic contributions
to other illnesses, as well as the routes through which patient knowledge is taken up into conventional scientific
research.113,114

11

How, and by whom, evidence is collected, authorised, and interpreted, will be central to what happens
to Long Covid, and to those with Long Covid, in the coming months and years. It is notable that some
conventional researchers and actors writing about persistent symptoms and sequelae have acknowledged and
cited some of these patient-made contributions.8,13 This, we hope, will become a more frequent occurrence. If
textbooks are commonly understood as conduits for disseminating established knowledge, then patients are
doing significantly more than ‘writing the first textbook on long covid’. Since the early months of the pandemic,
patients have been generators and analysers of observations, theories, conceptualizations and terms. They are
epistemic originators, in other words – rather than latter-day compilers of established facts. This has
implications that go beyond the current COVID-19 pandemic in terms of the renewed necessity of involving
patients – substantially, and justly – in the building of medical knowledge.

Trauma arising from various causes – the
experience of acute illness, impairment,
(potential) disability, lack of access to care,
disbelieving of symptoms, medical abandonment
and abuse
On-going ill health
New accessibility issues: for example if a patient
is suddenly in need of a wheelchair, or other
disability aids
Fractured personal relationships, in view, for
example, of one's new health/disability status
and/or loss of income
Stigma, discrimination, and social exclusion or
isolation, for example as a consequence of a still
poorly understood persistent illness; people
refusing to be near someone who has been
infected and/or fearing they are still infectious;
patients believing themselves to be still
infectious
Impacts on carers and family members
Loss of educational opportunities (especially for
those who had not completed education prior to
falling ill)
Potential additional disability burden for those
already disabled before SARS-CoV-2 infection
Extensive need for appropriate screenings and
investigations (including sophisticated tools for
best diagnostic practices)
Training of medical professionals with specific
knowledge of COVID-19 and its sequelae
Training of medical, rehabilitative and social
care for large cohorts of patients, such as the
creation of specialized clinics

●

Challenges for the clinical workforce – as many
clinicians have developed Long Covid111

●

Healthcare systems are deeply damaged by the
emergency and the long-term consequences of
the pandemic (economic etc.)

●

Increased numbers of people with long-term
illness/disabilities
Increase in mental health difficulties arising
from a variety of causes – including
discrimination, abandonment, and epistemic
injustice115

Potential risks in relation to Long Covid

Potential risks* (indicative, not exhaustive)

Potential effects (indicative not exhaustive)

Pandemic policy choices

●

Effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection – especially as
a generator of long-term effects, and in relation
to the young – as well as potential for reinfection are downplayed, increasing prevalence
of Long Covid

●

Health and social care systems are left
unprotected and underfunded

●

Focus and attention on vaccines and on postpandemic planning results in lack of attention to
those with Long Covid

Clinical approaches

●

Use of inappropriate therapies and rehabilitative
tools

●

Over-hasty diagnosis, diagnostic lumping,
under-diagnosis – particularly when in-depth
investigation of biological markers is not
available, or when such investigations do not
explain symptoms. (Potential trauma in both
clinicians and patients might exacerbate these
effects)

Determinations of access to care, treatment,

●

Diagnostic over-shadowing

●

Differential access – which demonstrates

rehabilitation

discrimination and exacerbates inequalities
(particularly grave dangers for disabled people
and those with a shorter life expectancy)
●

Lack of access to appropriate testing and
diagnostic tools, which might leave significant
numbers undiagnosed and untreated

●

Lack of access to COVID-free spaces in the
framework of potential reinfection: for example,
where Long Covid clinics are missing, patients
might be forced to go to general hospitals for
care and be at risk of being put in Covid wards
with infectious patients

14

●

Diminishment of the significance of Long
Covid, resulting in inadequate or no care, which
results in the exacerbation of persistent
symptoms, and/or permanent damage and/or
chronic illness and disability (children are
particularly at risk of having symptoms
disregarded)

●

Problems in accessing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination
(safety, priority in view of established
vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection)

*All risks are heightened for marginalised and ethnically minoritised communities; those living with preexisting, and often multiple, conditions; those living in poverty; migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers; those
who are LGBT+; those in prisons and detention centres; those who are homeless.

●

Rapid gathering of epistemic authority around certain
conventional researchers or research groups, which
marginalises patient-led expertise and knowledge
Gate-keeping in relation to the publication of patients’
contributions in journals
Those with Long Covid unable to access funding for
research and advocacy
Silencing of voices – including in patient-led
communities – from those from marginalised and
minoritized groups, from those unable to access tools
such as social media, and from those in the Global
South
Definitions of expertise marginalize or ignore
patients’ heterogeneous forms of expertise
Privileging of patients with clinical expertise – at the
expense of patients with other kinds of expertise
Exclusion of those with more severe illness and/or
disabilities, who might be unable to engage because of
societal barriers to participation
Exclusion of those with Long Covid from
conventional scientific channels where policies,
services, research priorities, and clinical classifications
are determined
The labour of those living with Long Covid goes
unpaid or is inadequately remunerated
Pressure from journalists to narrate particular stories,
revisit traumatic episodes, or disclose too much
Journalists and researchers/collaborators etc. fail to
acknowledge effects of patients’ symptoms and
demand too much
The entry of ethically insensitive, non-patient
researchers into patient-led spaces
Infiltration of imposters in support groups to gather
health data
Privacy breaches
Exploitation, abuse, or inappropriate use of patients’
records and testimonies – which were shared by
patients on and through various media to raise
awareness, and to help others suffering
Inadequate ethical oversight of acquiring data from
support groups/patient organizations50
De-prioritisation of epistemic and other contributions
from those with Long Covid
Favouring of certain medical specializations, research
groups, conceptual framings, and institutions
Medical and/or legal definitions impose thresholds
which leave certain patients out
Allocation of funds for research and treatment favours
certain approaches over others – which excludes
certain patients, or goes against patients’ priorities
Use and consolidation of ‘representative’ or
‘exemplary’ Long Covid cases which disregard other
experiences of Long Covid
