Dynamics of Behavior Change in the COVID World
Cristina Moya1,*, Patricio Cruz y Celis Peniche1, Michelle A. Kline2,3, Paul E. Smaldino4

All of the policies adopted or proposed so far to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus
require immediate and extensive behavioral change. However, changing behavior is difficult
even when the benefits are borne by solid science. Doing so effectively requires an
appreciation for how people learn behaviors, and translate information into action.
Evidence-based policies for altering health behaviors are not new. For example, a decade-old
systematic review of the health interventions literature identified 26 common behavior
change techniques such as providing various kinds of information, setting up graded tasks,
and making contracts (Abraham & Michie 2008). Perhaps most influentially, behavioral
economists have proposed nudges to influence people’s behaviors (Thaler & Sunstein 2009),
including ones that reduce coronavirus transmission (Van Bavel et al., 2020; Everett et al.,
2020). Beyond concerns regarding the efficacy of various nudges (Szaszi et al. 2017; Hummel
& Maedche, 2019), this approach lacks an integrative theoretical framework for
understanding why humans have particular heuristics, how behaviors are shaped by social
and economic structures, and which nudges are likely to work in different socio-cultural
contexts.
Insights from the evolutionary human sciences can improve the behavioral change
toolkit for researchers and policy makers. Specifically, effective policy should be based on an
understanding of humans as a cultural and cooperative species. Socially transmitted
information and culturally-informed motivations shape behavior change. The structure of
social networks and how group identities map onto those networks influence transmission
dynamics. Information can spread from person to person, similar to the way diseases spread
(Cavalli-Sforza & Feldman 1981; Sperber 1996; Centola 2018). Just as with disease, the
epidemiology of information is subject to structural and behavioral influences on
transmissibility. Below, we show why and how 1) the pandemic poses several adaptive
challenges with important tradeoffs, 2) people use social information to learn how to deal
with these, and 3) people adopt social norms in a group-based context.

1. Adaptive challenges under uncertainty
The current pandemic presents a variety of adaptive challenges. Most directly, people face
health risks to themselves, their kin, and others in their social network. This alone requires

managing tradeoffs between one’s own and others’ well-being. Furthermore, current
economic hardships can trigger or exacerbate food and housing insecurity, reduced
socioeconomic status, and risks to reproductive goals. Figuring out how to manage tradeoffs
across such different currencies requires people to act with incomplete information, often
under massive uncertainty. Inequality and demographic variation in disease prevalence and
outcomes (Bentley, this issue; Katzmarzyk & Heymsfield, this issue) add to this
unpredictability. Contexts like these, with high levels of uncertainty, are precisely when we
would expect people to rely most heavily on social, rather than individual, learning (Boyd &
Richerson 1995; Henrich & Boyd 1998).

2. How humans use social information
Researchers have begun to recognize the role of culture in public health, but this research
often stops at acknowledging that culture matters without explaining how and why it affects
behavior that is relevant to health (Singer et al 2016; Hruschka 2008). To answer these
questions, we must understand first how culture spreads through social learning. Being social
learners means that humans figure out the facts about their world, and how to respond to
those facts, in large part by using information transmitted through social connections. It also
means we often do not (or cannot) directly verify those facts ourselves.
Several features of this pandemic make social learning heuristics particularly useful.
First, the cost of learning through individual experience is high because of the difficulty of
direct observation (Csibra & Gergely 2011; Legare & Nielsen 2015). Not only is the virus
invisible to the human eye, cause and effect of exposure are difficult to link due to a long
incubation period and a high rate of asymptomatic infections. Second, there is no
opportunity for trial-and-error learning given people will likely only contract COVID-19
once, and the consequence of doing so is potentially quite costly. Third, given the novelty of
the virus, the necessity of behavior change before infection rates rise, and the rapidly
changing epidemiological landscape, it is nigh impossible to figure out the best course of
action on one’s own. The scientific community is actively debating basic descriptive statistics
like seroprevalence rates (Larremore et al., 2020), as well as which models and projections
best capture the pandemic’s dynamics (Ferguson et al., 2020; Eubank et al., 2020; Jones et al.,
this issue). This illustrates the difficulty of individually assessing (let alone gathering) the
empirical evidence.
In contexts of intense uncertainty, people increasingly rely on heuristics to select both
the types of information they seek out and the sources of that information (Gigerenzer &
Selten 2002; Laland 2004; Kendal et al. 2018). We describe two kinds of social learning
heuristics—learning from high status others, and learning from similar others—that help
people learn causally opaque, high-risk information.
Because of the rapid rate of epidemiological change, few people will have accurate
and up-to-date information about the best course of action. An extensive modeling literature
suggests that learning from successful or prestigious individuals is particularly adaptive
under these circumstances (Boyd & Richerson 1985). However, determining who is reliable

2

and trustworthy is no easy task (Henrich & Gil-White 2001). Potential role models may 1)
be successful for unclear reasons; 2) be expert in only some domains; or worst yet, 3) have
conflicts of interests with learners (Akerlof 1978; Sperber et. al. 2010). Learners may therefore
temper their decisions with skepticism. For example, if a model acts in conflict with their
own professed beliefs, learners may disregard their recommendations (Henrich 2009; von
Hippel & Trivers 2011) and, more broadly, dismiss that source as altogether unreliable.
Learners may view this kind of hypocrisy as breaking a social contract (Cosmides, Barrett, &
Tooby 2010), and learn to distrust institutions associated with the original violator. For
example, unethical treatment of Black men in the Tuskegee Study led to a greater distrust of
health providers in this demographic, and the extent to which Black men distrusted health
providers increased with proximity to Macon County, where Tuskegee is located (Alsan &
Wanamaker, 2018).
Based on context, people experience different challenges and tradeoffs in adapting to
the conditions of this pandemic. As a result, learners can be led astray by relying exclusively
on status when choosing from whom to learn. For example, consider whether it is useful for
the Democratic Republic of Congo, where less than 10% of the population has internet access,
to adopt online schooling strategies from richer countries with much more widely available
internet. Not surprisingly, people are more likely to adopt behaviors from others they
perceive as having similar costs and benefits (Efferson et. al. 2016). For children, this includes
selectively copying others who are similar in terms of sex, age, and accent (Schunk, 1987,
Kinzler et. al. 2010). This heuristic for learning from prestigious but similar others has been
leveraged in effective hand washing campaigns that developed cartoon role models
specifically for the local setting (Biran et. al. 2014). It behooves public health experts to
rigorously contextualize their policies and study methods (Kline et al. 2018; Broesch et al.,
2020), and consider how characteristics of the messenger might influence adoption.
While learning from high status, trusted, and similar others is generally adaptive,
there are two ways in which these heuristics can fail to change behaviors as intended. First,
pertinent public health information may fail to spread, and therefore fail to change behavior.
Second, harmful information can outcompete useful information. These two kinds of failures
have a common cause: the successful spread of information relies not only upon the quality
of the information, but upon the sources and routes of spread.
Inadequately considering transmission sources and pathways leads to the failed
adoption of health behaviors. Returning to the Tuskegee example, the distrust the study
sowed in nearby Black communities translated into their using medical services less
frequently, with disastrous consequences for their health and life expectancy. Similar distrust
of health interventions, particularly those championed by outsiders or powerful people, is
already shaping the fight against coronavirus. For example, in Chiapas, Mexico, some
communities have protested the use of anti-bacterial gel for fear that it is a medium through
which the government intentionally propagates coronavirus (Mandujano, 2020), and in the
US conspiracy theories involving Bill Gates have fueled anti-vaccine sentiments (Meisenzahl,
2020). Working with communities, rather than “on behalf of” them can strengthen trust, and

3

commitment to participate, in health interventions (Spoch-Spana et. al. 2020). Furthermore,
combating coronavirus requires trustworthy institutions. However, people’s confidence in
these varies across countries. For example, Americans’ low confidence in the national
government relative to local governments stands in contrast to the patterns in several
European countries (Perrotta et. al. 2020). This makes the maintenance of trust in global and
non-partisan institutions such as the WHO particularly important.
Perhaps more problematically, people may learn from well-regarded role models even
if the information they profess is not always accurate or adaptive (Henrich & Gil-White,
2001). To illustrate, only 20% of coronavirus-related misinformation is produced by
“politicians, celebrities and other prominent public figures” on social media, but their posts
are disproportionately liked and retweeted. As a result, the original posts represent 69% of
total social media engagement in the sample (Brennen, Simon, Howard & Kleis, 2020). When
disinformation spreads more easily through common channels—such as friends who are
generally trustworthy or prestigious partisan demagogues on social media—than does
accurate information broadcast by some other source (for example, the CDC), it can produce
clusters of people who learn and reinforce disinformation through their social connections
(Lerman et. al., 2016; Alipourfard et. al. 2020). Social media may increase this risk drastically
by enabling a few people to broadcast their opinions to millions of others (Krause et. al.,
2020; Brennen et. al., 2020), and by facilitating assortment according to shared opinions.
While learners often have heuristics for being skeptical of inaccurate knowledge, this kind of
skepticism works best when people possess an informational foothold upon which to base
their caution (Roozenbeck & van der Linden, 2019). This is problematic for contagious
diseases like the novel coronavirus because the goal of behavioral change is to protect as
many people as possible before direct exposure to the virus. Once people gain first-hand
information about the illness through exposure, it is too late for prophylactic behavioral
change. Along with the perils of social media comes the potential to harness its power for fast
transmission of useful information. This will rely on having high-status, principled, and
locally-trusted people or organizations model adaptive behaviors and share accurate public
health information.

3. Social learning happens in a group context
Groups not only affect who we have the opportunity to learn from, but also who we are
motivated to learn from. This is because groups develop social norms that govern which
behaviors are appropriate. Norms are then reinforced by the benefits of coordinating with
group members who share them (McElreath et al. 2003) or by the costs of being punished for
violating them (Boyd & Richerson, 1992). Group-level norms and enforcement translate to
individual-level motivations to adopt prescribed behaviors and signal group affiliation
(Chudek & Henrich 2010, Smaldino 2019). The individual benefits of social support, and the
costs of ostracism, loom particularly large during times of danger or uncertainty. As such,
circumstances like this pandemic tend to strengthen people’s affiliation with group identity

4

for historically adaptive reasons (Winterhalder 1986, Navarrete & Fessler 2005; Moffett
2019).
And yet, many of the norms that public health officials recommend for slowing the
spread of the novel coronavirus rely on sharing behavioral norms across regions and across
nations. This requires 1) adopting social norms that solve cooperative dilemmas, 2) doing so
in a coordinated fashion, and 3) agreeing on which values to prioritize. In other words, we
need social norms on a broad scale to help regulate behavior change.
Many recommended public health measures represent cooperative dilemmas. By this
we mean that society as a whole would be better off if everyone complied with the
recommendations, but the cost of compliance makes it unprofitable for individuals to adopt
the behavior. For example, most masks protect others more than they protect the wearer
(Keung et. al., 2020). Assuming that individuals find masks uncomfortable or inconvenient,
each individual might be best served by going bare-faced but demanding that all others cover
up. Further complicating matters, most social distancing measures do not exact the same
costs on every individual. For example, people with office jobs can work from home while
people with service jobs may find themselves unemployed. These asymmetries in individual
costs mean that shelter-in-place measures may require dramatically more costly pro-sociality
from some people in comparison with others. Despite the common refrain that “we’re all in
this together,” for some individuals what is best for the public good is also best for them (e.g.
people particularly vulnerable to coronavirus), while for others there is a direct conflict (e.g.,
performers or bar owners who cannot replace in-person business).
Heterogeneity of individual costs and the ability to incur them helps to explain why
people’s mobility dropped more in wealthier areas of the US than in poorer areas after stayat-home orders were issued (Weill et. al., 2020; Wright et. al., 2020). Still, for a large part of
the population, such as the young and healthy who are at lower risk of complications from
coronavirus (Garg et al., 2020), the proposed social distancing measures require some
willingness to pay a cost for the benefit of others. In the absence of enforcement of costly
norms, cooperative compliance can decline (Fehr & Gachter, 1999). To solve such
cooperative dilemmas, social groups often rely on coordinated sanctioning of norm-violators
(e.g. shaming, fining, ostracizing). Harnessing people’s reputational concerns can motivate
cooperation more reliably than emphasizing the individual costs and benefits of actions
(Kraft-Todd et. al. 2015). Perhaps surprisingly, framing COVID preventative measures as
pro-social rather than self-interested increases online participants’ intentions of complying
with such behaviors (Jordan et. al. 2020).
Coordination is not only critical for effective sanctioning, it is particularly important
in the context of coronavirus management. If everyone around the world self-isolated at the
same time, the pandemic would be over in a matter of weeks (i.e. however long it would take
for the last currently-infected person to recover). Suppression and mitigation efforts are
more effective when these actions are coordinated across both individuals and groups
(whether at the household, county, state, or country level) (Holtz et al., 2020). Still, the
individual motivations for non-coordination (e.g. greater profits when fewer competitors are

5

at work), make this kind of coordination more suitable to top-down institutional
arrangements. These can provide incentives that help align individuals’ best options with the
public need (e.g., expanded unemployment benefits that allow workers to stay home at a
lower cost to themselves). Strong, impartial institutions that can guarantee norm-compliance
foster prosocial behaviors at lower levels of organization (Henrich et al., 2010), even towards
anonymous strangers or those perceived to be members of an out-group (Hruschka et al.,
2014). There is a tradeoff however; relying on high-quality institutions also limits the extent
to which people are willing to incur a personal cost to punish norm-violators (e.g. ostracizing
friends who are not socially distancing or boycotting companies that do not provide
safeguards for their employees) (Stagnaro et. al., 2017). Furthermore, institutional sanctions
can lead to unexpected outcomes, such as increasing mistrust among people (Mulder et. al.,
2006), or creating an incentive to act anti-socially if people interpret paying the sanctions as
licensing the norm violation (Gneezy & Rustichini, 1999).
Finally, getting all people to agree on the values (i.e. currencies) that should be
optimized and on which groups’ well-being should be prioritized also presents a challenge.
Norms regulate not just that people should cooperate, but how they do so. The fact that
people are synchronously engaged in multiple cooperative dilemmas with different
currencies and regarding different levels of social organization (Lubell 2015; Smaldino 2019)
produces inter-group heterogeneity in which social norms and values develop. For example,
going out during a stay-at-home order to sell non-essential goods may be considered
defecting at the community level by increasing transmission risks, but it may be cooperative
at the household level if the person is taking a personal risk to provide for a financially
precarious household. Further complicating coordination, norms can develop in opposition
to those of other groups, often as signals of group membership and devotion (Iannaccone
1992; McElreath et al. 2003). The result may be opposing value judgments on the same
information, and a failure by each group to adopt beneficial behaviors that are associated
with another group (Akerlof & Kranton 2000; Smaldino et al. 2017). This has particularly
damaging consequences when public health behaviors become politicized (Smaldino & Jones
2020). For example, wearing a mask in a nearly empty park, or not wearing one in a crowded
market, can not only indicate one’s perceptions of mask efficacy, but also signal a political
affiliation. The same phenomenon affects behavior beyond pandemic policy. Political
psychologists have shown that exposure to the same stimuli can have opposite effects on
partisans’ support for specific political policies and figures (Taber et al. 2009; Abramowitz &
Webster 2016). This phenomenon can help explain why, in the context of the COVID-19
pandemic, information recommending the wearing of facial masks to promote public health
may actually decrease the intention to wear masks among political conservatives in the US
(Utych 2020).
People (even Americans) accept most scientific information with little hesitation,
even if they do not comprehend it (Kahan 2017). Similarly, a majority of norms are shared
across subgroups within nations. For example, a majority of both Republicans and
Democrats reported wearing masks outside of their homes (Gadarian et. al. 2020) and

6

supported major shutdown policies, at least early in the pandemic (Van Green & Tyson
2020). This gives hope that norms can spread without becoming partisan or markers of
subgroup identities. However, shared norms and sanctions for violations must be established
for prosocial norms to persist (Ostrom 1990). Because local informal networks are most likely
to mete out punishment for low-level violations (e.g. inappropriate social distancing), these
social ties are particularly relevant for the enforcement of norms. On the other hand,
coordinated responses to the pandemic do seem to require higher-level institutional
guidance.
4. Conclusion
Creating effective behavioral recommendations that will reduce public health fallout from
the COVID-19 pandemic, while balancing economic and social concerns, is a daunting
challenge in its own right. Obtaining compliance with those behavioral recommendations is
perhaps an even greater challenge. Homo sapiens is an inherently social and cultural
species. We are bounded in our ability to rationally process information about the world.
As such, we rely on cues from individuals in our social networks, and from prestigious
members of our identity groups. Solutions that are appealing to some will be costly or
aversive to others. There are thus major hurdles to implementing wide adoption of new
behaviors even when the science supporting the positive health outcomes is rock solid.
Increasing compliance with public health measures requires (1) identifying the
adaptive challenges and tradeoffs people are facing, (2) understanding how people use
social information to learn how to deal with these, and (3) recognizing that people adopt
social norms in a group-based context. This framework can help scientists assess the
cooperative dilemmas that are generated by public health measures at different levels of
social organization (from the household to international scales), and evaluate the
effectiveness of strategies to incentivize cooperation and deter defection at each level. This
sits in contrast with other approaches to behavioral change (such as nudging) that lack a
cohesive theoretical framework for understanding human behavior across contexts.
Dictating widespread behavioral change should not be executed lightly.
Prescriptions must be sensitive to local contexts. Are there cultural reasons why certain
behaviors are unappealing? Are there salient identities that activate an aversion to those
doing the recommending? How do existing cultural norms and psychological habits
interact within a population? Epidemiological dynamics can be incredibly complex in a
structured population, whether what spreads is an infectious disease or information. When
the spread of information and the spread of behaviors that impact disease are coupled (i.e.
mutually influence each other), the situation becomes even more complex. Appreciating
the specific challenges of behavioral change in real humans—who have evolved
psychologies for learning from others and are entrenched in social and cultural
communities—is paramount for maximizing the benefits of public health
recommendations.
