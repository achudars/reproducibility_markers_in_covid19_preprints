Abstract
Objectives. To investigate how COVID-19-related health and socio-economic vulnerabilities occur at
the household level, and how they are distributed across household types and geographical areas in
the United Kingdom.
Design Cross-sectional, nationally representative study.
Setting The United Kingdom.
Participants ~19,400 households.
Main outcome measures Using multiple household-level indicators and principal components
analysis, we derive summary measures representing different dimensions of household vulnerabilities
critical during the COVID-19 epidemic: health, employment, housing, financial and digital.
Results Our analysis highlights four key findings. First, although COVID-19 health risks are
concentrated in retirement-age households, a substantial proportion of working age households also
face these risks. Second, different types of households exhibit different vulnerabilities, with workingage households more likely to face financial, housing and employment precarities, and retirement-age
households health and digital vulnerabilities. Third, there are area-level differences in the distribution
of household-level -vulnerabilities across England and the constituent countries of the United
Kingdom. Fourth, in many households, different dimensions of vulnerabilities intersect; this is
especially prevalent among working-age households.
Conclusions The findings imply that the short- and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 crisis are
likely to significantly vary by household type. Policy measures that aim to mitigate the health and
socio-economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic should consider how vulnerabilities cluster
together across different household types, and how these may exacerbate already existing
inequalities.

Summary Box
What is already known on this topic
•

•

During the global COVID-19 pandemic, people spend much more time in their immediate
households, due to lockdown measures, the need to self-isolate, and school and workplace
closures.
Poor health and socio-economic conditions frequently co-occur at the individual level in the
general population.

What this study adds
•

•

COVID-19-specific health-risks and socio-economic vulnerabilities (financial, housing, digital
and employment) co-occur among households in the UK. However, economic vulnerabilities
cluster more in working-age households, whereas health and digital vulnerabilities cluster in
retirement-age households.
Policy measures that aim to mitigate the adverse effects of COVID-19 should not only consider
health vulnerabilities but also household structure and household-level disadvantages such as
poor housing conditions, economic insecurity, and limited access to modern technology.

Introduction
The COVID-19 global health crisis has led to the widespread introduction of physical distancing
measures that keep people in their homes, including household lockdowns, self-isolation for high-risk
individuals, and school and workplace closures. As these measures may need to remain in place for
some time, this situation leads to concerns over financial, physical and psychological effects as well as
potentially widening societal and health inequalities1. In the current situation, some household
characteristics have become elevated in importance for wellbeing, such as access to a garden or safe
outdoor space, technology and internet connectivity, and lack of household crowding, especially
because under the given circumstances, these factors cannot be mitigated by interactions with school,
work and community contexts2-5. Furthermore, global economic slowdown and rising unemployment6
may interact with these disparities and exacerbate already existing health and socio-economic
inequalities as the pandemic progresses.
Policy advice has so far been oriented towards mitigating individual health risk, without much
consideration of how old and young individuals are nested within different household structures and
how their opportunities to follow government guidelines might be limited by household and housing
characteristics. For example, the UK government has advised 'extremely vulnerable’ individuals to
shield themselves and self-isolate (often along with their entire household) for a period of 12 weeks,
but due to different household situations, this may have radically different implications for how they
can protect themselves and organise their lives. We also know from the health inequalities literature
that ill health is more common among those suffering other social deprivations, such as poorer
housing, overcrowding, financial precarities and social exclusion7 8. Therefore, self-isolation may
negatively impact other dimensions of disadvantage, not only for the ‘extremely vulnerable’
individuals but also for their household members. A much larger proportion of the population might
be considered ‘high risk’ suffering with chronic conditions that make the chances of COVID-19
complications more likely, such as severe respiratory illnesses. Even in households with no members
suffering immediate COVID-19 health vulnerabilities, intersecting social and economic vulnerabilities
might exacerbate or contribute to the development of further vulnerabilities over time1.
Understanding at-risk groups is crucial to be able to prevent a health and socio-economic crises in the
short- and long-term.
2

In this paper, we investigate household-level health and socio-economic vulnerabilities and how they
co-occur across different household types and geographic areas, using cross-sectional data from a
nationally representative household survey in the United Kingdom. Our principal aim is to identify
intersecting dimensions of household vulnerability, to investigate how they vary by household type
and region, and to determine the importance of intersecting vulnerabilities and household structure
when mitigating the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
Methods
Data
We used information from the latest available wave (wave 9) of the UK Household Longitudinal Study9
(UKHLS), from 2017-2019, which interviewed approximately 36,000 individuals nested in
approximately 20,000 households. We dropped 622 households (3%) due to missing values on the
variables used in the analyses. Our analytical sample consists of 19,425 householdsa.
Variables
Indicators of household-level vulnerability
All vulnerability indicators are calculated at the household-level. For some indicators, information is
only available at the individual level. In this case, we have calculated measures at the household-level
indicating whether at least one person in the household has a given vulnerability.
We used binary indicators to measure digital and connectivity features of the household: whether the
household reported having a home internet connection, and whether they owned a laptop, PC,
netbook, tablet, or other type of computer.
Housing conditions were captured through three indicators: whether the household lived in a flat (a
proxy for lack of access to outdoor space), whether the accommodation was privately rented, and
whether the household lived in overcrowded conditions. Overcrowding was defined as having more
than 1 person per room (excluding bathrooms and kitchens) in the dwelling; a measure shown to have
equal validity compared with more complex overcrowding metrics10.
Employment conditions of the household were captured using three dummy indicators of whether
anyone in the household was unemployed, worked part-time, or was employed on a temporary
contract.
The financial conditions of the households were measured using two indicators. First, we used a binary
variable indicating whether the household reported being in payment arrears (either being behind on
paying bills at the time of the interview or having been behind on housing payments in the last 12
months). Second, we created a dummy indicator for households with relative low income defined as
households whose net equivalized household income was lower than 60% of the median net
equivalized household income following the definition used by the Department for Work and
Pensions11.

a

Of these 19,425 households, 83% has completed interviews with all eligible household members or provided
proxy asnwers for those who did not provide a full interview. Additional analyses (not shown but available upon
request) showed that the findings are very similar if we only use information from these households.

3

We defined two health indicators. First, we derived an individual-level indicator for health conditions
indicating a higher risk of COVID-19 complications. In wave 1 of UKHLS (2009-2011) (or in case of new
entrants the first time they were interviewed), respondents report if they have ever been doctordiagnosed with a list of health conditionsb. In subsequent waves, respondents were asked about any
new health conditions diagnosed since last interview. Using the current NHS guidancec which provides
a list of conditions indicating high risk, we created a binary indicator if the respondent reported ever
being diagnosed with any of the following: asthma, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease,
angina, heart attack or myocardial infarction, stroke, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, liver condition,
diabetes, cancer, or hypertension). As these are chronic illnesses, we assumed that if an individual
reported a condition in a prior wave, the condition also persists to later waves. The prevalence of
these individual conditions at the household level is shown in Appendix Table A1. The most common
illnesses were hypertension (27%) and asthma (17%). To capture those individuals who had more
severe versions of these conditions, we combined information from this variable and one which
indicates whether individuals suffered from any long-standing physical or mental impairment, illness,
or disability. The health indicator variable takes the value of 1 if there is an individual in the household
who has ever had any of the listed conditions and who also reported to have a long-standing condition
in wave 9. The second health indicator takes the value of 1 if there is an individual in the household
who reported that their current job status is ‘long-term sick or disabled’.
Household type and area type
Based on the age of and relationships between household members, we categorised households into
five types: single-parent households with children (15 years and under), working-age (below state
pension aged) adult households with children, working-age adult households without children, multigenerational households (i.e. at least one working-age adult and one over state pension age, not
necessarily related), and retirement-age households, containing only those who are at least of state
pension age.
The area type variable divided UK households into the North of England (North East, North West,
Yorkshire and Humber, East and West Midlands), South of England (East of England, South East and
South West), London, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Analysis
After describing the distribution of household-level vulnerability indicators and household type, we
used principal components analysis (PCA) to establish different dimensions of household
vulnerability12. PCA has been widely used and validated in the multidimensional poverty literature as
a data reduction technique also when analysing a set of binary variables13. The number of principal
components was selected such that the eigenvalue was larger than 1 for each principal component14.
After applying promax oblique rotation,e we determined which indicator belongs to which principal
component by applying the commonly agreed criteria that the factor loading needs to be above 0.321517
. Then, to analyse how different dimensions of vulnerabilities are distributed across household types
b

These conditions are asthma, arthritis, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, angina, heart attack or
myocardial infarction, stroke, emphysema, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, chronic bronchitis, liver condition,
diabetes, cancer or malignancy, epilepsy, hypertension, clinical depression, and in some waves also multiple
sclerosis, HIV, and other long standing/chronic condition.

d
As state pension age varies by respondents’ birth year, UKHLS uses information on respondents’ age at the
time of interview to determine whether they were of state pension age following state pension rules applicable
since 6 April 2016.
e
Varimax rotation leads to very similar factor loadings and identical principal components.

and different geographical areas, we calculated dummy variables for the top 25% of the scores on
each principal component to indicate households who are most vulnerable on each dimension. All
estimates were weighted using cross-sectional household weights.
Results
First, we describe the indicators used in the analyses. Figure 1 shows the proportion of households
who experience different types of vulnerabilities. The most striking finding is that 32% of households
contain at least one individual with a COVID-19 high-risk condition. This was more common in
retirement-age and multi-generational households (both 49%) but ranged between 16 and 26 % in
working age households (Appendix Table A2). It was also notable that single-parent households were
the most financially precarious: approximately one third experienced payment arrears and low
income. (Appendix Table A2). Second, around 23% of households have at least one individual who is
a part-time employee. These households might be at higher risk of COVID-19-induced financial
vulnerabilities as they might have fewer savings than households with only full-time employed
individuals. Furthermore, between 10-15% of households live in a flat, live in privately rented
dwellings, has no access to the internet, and has no access to a computer, laptop, tablet or netbook
in the household. A smaller share of households experience overcrowding (3.5%), unemployment (5%)
or temporary employment (9%), have payment arrears (8%) or contains a person who cannot work
due to long-term health conditions or disabilities (6%).

Next, we show the distribution of different types of households (Figure 2). The majority of households
in the UK (40%) are working-age adult households without resident children; the next largest (30%)
type of households are retirement-age households. These are followed by working-age adult
households with resident children (18%), multi-generational households (7%), and single-parent
households (6%). In terms of household size, almost 60% of retirement-age households contained one
person and living alone was also common among working-age households without children (42%)
(results not shown, but available on request). Table A2 and A3 in the Appendix show how these
vulnerability indicators are distributed across different household types and geographic areas,
respectively.

To reduce the number of vulnerability indicators, we used PCA. The results revealed five distinct
dimensions of household vulnerabilities (Table 1): digital (access to internet, access to computer),
financial (overcrowding, unemployment, low household income, payment arrears), employment
(part-time and temporary employment), housing (living in flat and private renting), and health (COVID
health risk and long-term illness). In the following parts of the analysis, we use these five dimensions
of vulnerabilities and analyse how being in the top quartile (worst off) for these household-level
vulnerabilities are distributed across different household types (Figure 3) and different geographical
areas (Figure 4) of the United Kingdom.

Single-parent households are most likely to experience the most severe financial, housing and
employment vulnerabilities (51%, 46% and 32% of single-parent households, respectively).
Additionally, 22% of these households face severe digital vulnerabilities. Working-age adult
households with children are most likely to experience severe vulnerabilities for employment (43%),
financial (31%), and housing (24%) dimensions. Around 10% of these households face severe digital
and health vulnerabilities. Working-age adult households without children are most likely to
experience housing precarities (34%) (compared with other precarities) and are approximately equally
vulnerable on all other dimensions (around 20-25%). The most commonly experienced vulnerability
in multi-generational households is health vulnerabilities (40%), and a large share of these households
also experience severe employment-related disadvantage (28%). Around 19% of these households
experience severe digital vulnerabilities, 17% faces financial vulnerabilities and around 10% severe
housing issues. Approximately 40% of retirement-age households experience severe health
vulnerabilities and 47% digital vulnerabilities, but a large share of them also face severe financial (17%)
and housing (19%) precarities.

We find some differences in the types of vulnerabilities households experience by geography (Figure
4). Comparing the North and South of England, households in the North experience somewhat higher
levels of severe digital, financial, and health vulnerabilities whereas those in the South are somewhat
more likely to experience severe housing and employment vulnerabilities. London stands out;
households in London are particularly exposed to severe housing and digital vulnerabilities when
compared to other areas of England. Households in Wales are very similar to those in England although
they experience somewhat higher levels of digital and health vulnerabilities. Households in Scotland
are most exposed to severe digital and housing vulnerabilities whereas in Northern Ireland, digital and
financial vulnerabilities are the most prevalent.

Many households experience intersecting vulnerabilities (Table 2); this is especially prevalent among
working-age households. Among single-parent households, a large proportion (>30%) of households
who face severe health, digital, and employment precarities, also face financial and housing
disadvantage and many (54%) who experience severe financial disadvantage also experience housing
precarity. Among working-age households (with and without children), severe health and digital
vulnerabilities intersect with financial and housing disadvantage and financial precarities intersect
with housing vulnerabilities. In addition, among working-age households without children, severe
health vulnerabilities intersect with severe digital vulnerabilities. Intersecting vulnerabilities are
somewhat less prevalent among multi-generational and retirement-age households. In both, severe
digital vulnerabilities overlap with severe financial disadvantage. In addition, 42% of retirement-age
households who have severe health vulnerabilities also have digital vulnerabilities and 33% of those
who experience digital vulnerabilities also face housing disadvantage.

Discussion
Our analysis highlights four key findings. First, while COVID-19 health risks are concentrated in
retirement-age households, a substantial proportion (up to 25%) of working age households also face
these health risks.
Second, we show that all types of households are exposed to multiple, intersecting vulnerabilities.
Financial and housing precarity is most prevalent among single-parent households, working-age adult
households with children primarily face employment and financial insecurities, whereas their childless
counterparts are equally vulnerable on all dimensions. Multi-generational households are likely to
experience health and employment vulnerabilities, whereas retirement-age households are
characterised by the prevalence of digital and health vulnerabilities. This emphasises that in multigenerational and retirement-age households, health risks co-exist with socio-economic vulnerabilities.
This could mean that poor health, or the need to shield, could exacerbate existing financial precarities,
9

or indeed that economic necessity could prevent households from self-isolating appropriately.
Economic recession for households on the brink financially could worsen physical and social health
conditions, thus making people even more vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19. We show that even
in households where health-related risks are not as prevalent, different dimensions of socio-economic
vulnerabilities co-exist. This highlights the importance of intersecting precarities, which may push
vulnerable households towards poorer health outcomes.
Third, there is some variation in vulnerabilities across different areas of England and the constituent
countries of the United Kingdom. This indicates that regional approaches may be considered when
deciding on how to best mitigate the health and socio-economic consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
However, more spatial disaggregation is necessary to understand regional and neighbourhood-level
vulnerabilities.
Fourth, in many households, different dimensions of vulnerabilities intersect. Among all household
types and especially among working-age households, all dimensions of vulnerabilities intersect with
financial and housing disadvantage. Among working-age households without children and among
retirement-age households, severe health vulnerabilities intersect with severe digital disadvantage.
The results highlight the importance of household structure for the potential short- and long-term
effects of the COVID-19 crisis. Future policy measures that aim to mitigate the socio-economic and
health consequences of the COVID-19 crisis should consider the critical importance of household
structure.
Household-level socio-economic and health vulnerabilities are likely to be context-specific, and thus
the role of households for moderating inequalities might be more or less relevant in other countries.
For example, in Southern Europe with a greater proportion of inter-generational co-residence and
contact18 19, household structure might matter in different ways, by making direct transmission to high
risk individuals more likely, for example. Similarly, the types of vulnerabilities that are relevant will
vary according to context, and high and low-income settings. In the United States, multidimensional
poverty and race intersect at the individual, household and neighbourhood scales. In low income
settings, for example, household crowding and mixed generation households might pose serious
barriers to the ability to shield elderly and vulnerable people, and these are likely to intersect with
other dimensions of poverty20. Future studies should compare the importance of different dimensions
of vulnerabilities by household type across European as well as low- and middle-income countries.
This study has some limitations. First, we likely underestimate the prevalence of health vulnerabilities
as these measures are self-reported and not all members of the household have agreed to be
interviewed. Additionally, our disease identification strategy is not specific enough to capture
extremely vulnerable individuals who need to shield, because we do not know some of these precise
conditions, nor do we know the severity of the conditions included in the analyses. In addition, further
work is needed to explore patterns of multimorbidity, including mental health conditions, which are
an addititional vulnerability. Future work should repeat this analysis using linked health and
administrative data that allow for identifying very high-risk individuals. Second, our analysis is based
on data from 2017-19. However, we expect the relationships to be similar in 2020. Taken together,
our study suggests that policy measures should take better account of household structure and
dynamics for identifying vulnerabilities and advising citizens on how to deal with risk.
