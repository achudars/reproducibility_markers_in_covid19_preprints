Abstract
The contribution focusses on Covid-19 associated discrimination (CAD) in Germany
and asks whether immigrants from Asian origin are increasingly discriminated
against during the COVID-19 pandemic and whether other immigrant groups face
similar threats. Using data from the COVID-19 add-on-survey for CILS4EU-DE
(CILS4COVID), we demonstrate that immigrants from Asian origin report an
increasing CAD during the pandemic, which is more pronounced for respondents
residing in administrative districts with a more dynamic COVID-19 situation.
Similar results can be found for respondents originating from both American
continents and from countries of the former Soviet Union. Given that COVID-19
was first reported in Asia, but with rather low number of infections later on, and the
rather high infection rates on both American continents and in Russia, we conclude
that CAD experienced by these groups might happen in a reaction to both realistic
and symbolic threats posed by the virus.

Motivation

The novel coronavirus COVID-19 has not only brought the most severe challenge to the
global economy, stability and social order since the World War II, the instances of ethnic and
racial discrimination have considerably increased in many countries (Ng 2020; He et al.
2020; Pew Research Center 2020). Discrimination toward people who share social or
behavioural characteristics with COVID-19 patients but themselves may not carry the novel

virus has received a special term ‘COVID-19 associated discrimination’ (CAD) (Liu et al.
2020). Individuals of Chinese or Asian descent have primarily—but not solely—become the
targets of CAD, hate crimes, stigmatization and labelling as spreaders of disease (Coates
2020; Devakumar et al. 2020; Chung & Li, 2020; Liu et al. 2020; Pew Research Center 2020;
Tessler et al. 2020).

Since the outbreak in early 2020, numerous news outlets around the world have reported
cases of discrimination against Asians (He et al. 2020; Timberg and Chiu 2020; Kelly 2020;
Kandil 2020). Social media analyses demonstrate a surge in the use of offensive language in
social media captured by a number of tweets exclusively mentioning ‘Chinese virus’ or
‘China virus’ instead of coronavirus or COVID-19 (Budhwani and Sun 2020 for US) or any
Sinophobe speech on Twitter (Stechemesser et al. 2020 for English-language tweets
globally). Also in Germany, particularly in the beginning of the pandemic, media—including
social media—have been extensively reporting about the increase in discrimination and
instances of harassment among individuals of Asian descent (Klaus 2020; Hoff 2020).

Notwithstanding existing media reports, we still lack reliable empirical evidence regarding
the extent of discrimination related to COVID-19 pandemic among ethnic and racial
minorities in Germany based on representative data. Therefore, the first objective of the
current study is descriptive. We pursue a question whether Asian minorities in Germany
report an increase in discrimination since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We
further explore to what extent other ethnic minorities are also affected by CAD. The second
objective is more analytical. We seek to explore to what extent possible discriminatory
tendencies towards Asians and potentially other minorities originating in countries with high
COVID-19 penetration can be explained by the extent of threat COVID-19 poses to
individuals' health.

Migration and ethnic divisions in Germany

Reviewing major migration inflows to Germany, one would find little mentioning of mass
migration from the far East. The guest worker migration in the 1950–1970s to west Germany
and subsequent family reunification encompassed immigration from the Mediterranean
countries, mainly, Southern Europe (Italy, Spain and Greece), Turkey as well as former
Yugoslavia. A similar guest worker scheme with Northern Vietnam, albeit on a smaller scale,
was adopted by the eastern German socialist regime to enable Vietnamese migrants to come
and work in the GDR.

Refugee migration came predominantly from the communist Eastern Europe to west
Germany (particularly until the late 1980s), Yugoslavia (in the early 1990s) and Turkey, as
well as more recently from the Middle Eastern countries, predominantly Syria, Afghanistan
and eastern Africa (OECD 2017). Refugees’ migration from Asian countries happened
primarily from southern Vietnam in the 1970-1980s, when Vietnamese boat and quota
refugees found safe haven in west Germany.

Other more recent waves of migration originate largely in Europe and encompass free
movements within the European Union, primarily from East to West (Van Mol and de Valk
2016). The return migration of ethnic German diaspora mainly from Poland and the former
Soviet Union (Kogan 2011) is yet another within-European migration phenomenon, specific
to Germany.

Notwithstanding the distinct case of the Vietnamese migration to western and eastern parts of
Germany, there has been a steady but numerically minor migration of individuals with Asian
descent—primarily from Vietnam, China, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and the
3

Philippines—to Germany beginning from the 19th century (Gütinger 2004). More recently
these inflows come in form of labour, student and marriage migration.

As in many Western immigrant-receiving countries, in Germany minorities originating in
East Asia are integrated exceptionally well in a structural dimension. They belong to the best
performing migrant groups within the German education system (Kemper 2015: 85) and are
among the least discriminated groups in the German labour market (Koopmans et al. 2018).
Results of the recent field experiment demonstrate that German employers do not
discriminate against Western and Southern European and East Asian immigrants (ibid: 22),
whereas other origin groups, particularly Turkish-origin individuals (Kaas and Manger 2012;
Schneider et al. 2014), experience considerable disadvantages.

COVID-19 threat and CAD

This study builds upon the integrated or intergroup threat theory (ITT), widely used in
psychology and sociology to causally link (perceived) threat and between-group prejudices
(Stephan and Stephan 2000; Stephan et al. 2009). ITT is applicable to the case of any ethnic
or social group that may feel threatened, regardless of whether those threats actually exist or
are just perceived. An example would be majority ethnic group’s perception of economic
threat from ethnic minorities, who are believed to take over jobs and supress wages, even
though in reality such effects might not even exist. Just a perception of economic or any
other, e.g., security, threat might increase prejudice against the outgroup.

In the theory update, Stephan and Renfro (2002) pointed to the importance of two key types
of threat: realistic and symbolic. The realistic threat is defined as an existential danger to the
ingroup in terms of physical safety, health, well-being or economic situation (see also
4

Campbell’s [1965] realistic conflict theory). Symbolic threats arise when the lifestyle, values
and norms of an outgroup differ from those of the ingroup and therefore pose a threat to the
latter. The basic idea is that values, norms, beliefs, attitudes and lifestyles are manifestations
of one’s identity, which is likely to be threatened by socially and culturally distant outgroups.

The threat posed by COVID-19 is, on the one hand, a realistic threat of global importance,
likely to translate into the prejudice against outgroups, which are particularly associated with
the spread of the virus (e.g., because these groups originate in countries with high levels of
COVID-19 penetration). On the other hand, COVID-19 threat might be a symbolic threat, if
it pertains to ethnic groups with distinctively different life styles, habits, and norms, believed
to be somehow related to COVID-19. Following Tessler et al’s (2020) discussion, we argue,
that in eyes of the ingroup, individuals originating in China might pose both realistic (due to
the high number of COVID-19 cases particularly in the beginning of the pandemic) and
symbolic threat (due to e.g. exotic traditions and eating habits).

Therefore, and similarly to the situation in other countries, we expect Asian minorities in
Germany to report particularly high rates of CAD (Hypothesis 1). We further expect higher
rates of CAD to be reported by ethnic minorities in areas in which threat of COVID-19 is
more substantial (Hypothesis 2).

Data and Methods
The empirical analyses draw on data from the German part of the Children of Immigrant
Longitudinal Survey in Four European Countries (CILS4EU-DE; Kalter et al. 2019a; Kalter
et al. 2019b). More precisely, we rely on data that was collected during the COVID-19 addon survey (CILS4COVID) which was conducted almost parallel to the eighth wave of the
5

CILS4EU-DE survey, starting on April 22, 2020. CILS4EU-DE is a German long-term
project succeeding the international CILS4EU-survey, which was conducted between 2010
and 2014 in Germany, England, the Netherlands and Sweden. CILS4EU’s main aim was to
study the integration of 14-15-year-old students with and without an immigrant background
in the respective societies. From 2014 onwards, CILS4EU-DE continues to track the lives of
CILS4EU’s original respondents plus, starting from 2016 (wave 6), an additional refreshment
sample (for more information, see Kalter et al. 2019b).
The target population of CILS4COVID are participants of the CILS4EU-DE study who took
part in wave 7 or temporarily dropped out in wave 7 but participated in wave 6. The study
focusses on young adults born between 1994 and 1996 and aged approximately between 24 to
26 during the field work of the CILS4COVID survey. In total, 5,254 persons were invited to
participate in a web- or a postal survey. Overall, 3,472 participated in CILS4COVID as of
July 27 (response rate 66 per cent). Due to item non-response, we will consider 3,016 cases in
the analyses. Given that the aim of CILS4EU-DE is to study integration processes among
respondents with and without an immigrant background, CILS4EU-DE oversampled
respondents with an immigrant background during the original sampling process in 2010 as
well as during the sample selection of the refreshment (for more information, see CILS4EU
2016; Kalter et al. 2019b; Schiel et al. 2016). 2 This will be considered by applying design
weights to the descriptive as well as to the multivariate analyses.
Shortly after the beginning of the data collection for the eighth wave of the CILS4EU-DE
data in March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic massively hit Germany, which led to the
decision to investigate how respondents are doing during the pandemic, what their worries
are, what information they rely upon, etc. and inquiring about economic, social as well as

For our analyses, respondents are defined as having an immigrant background if at least one grandparent is
foreign born.

emotional consequences of the pandemic. Another key focus of CILS4COVID was on selfreported discrimination among immigrants. More precisely, we ask the following question:
‘Since the beginning of the Corona-pandemic, do you feel increasingly discriminated against
or treated unfairly due to your ethnic background?’ The answer categories are ‘yes’, ‘rather
yes’, ‘rather no’, ‘no’ and ‘I feel never discriminated against’. The variable is constructed in
such a way, that the last category filters out respondents who never feel discriminated. The
first four categories therefore correspond only to those respondents who actually feel
discriminated against and for whom the extent of CAD is meaningful to determine. 3
Since the dependent variable contains a substantial number of respondents who report to be
never discriminated against (see Figure 1 below), exclusion of those individuals might
introduce bias into the estimations. To address this possible selection bias, we ran the
Heckman's sample selection correction, which involves simultaneously estimating the
selection and outcome/response equations. Since the main outcome variable is measured on
an ordinal scale, we estimated an ordered probit model with Heckman selection (command:
heckoprobit in Stata 16.0).
The following variables are included into the selection equation: the highest ISEI-score in the
family (of the respondent’s father and mother), the highest educational degree of respondents,
gender (‘female’; ‘male’), whether they have a partner (‘yes’ or ‘no’), whether they have
children (‘yes’ or ‘no’) and information about respondents’ current socio-economic situation
(‘school/studying’; apprenticeship; ‘full-time or part-time work’; ‘unemployed’; ‘something
else’).
Further we control for the origin of individuals. Due to limitations in the number of cases for
specific immigrant groups, we decided to group the sample into broader regional categories,

3

For the analyses, the values of the four categories are reversed, i.e. higher values indicate an increase in CAD.

whenever this was necessary. In the following, we differentiate between respondents without
an immigrant background (‘Germany’; n=1,696), between respondents originating from
Turkey (n=277), from countries from the Former Soviet Union (‘FSU’; n=163), from Poland
(n=181), from countries from the former Yugoslav Republic (‘FYR’; n=82), from Eastern
European countries (n=120), from other European countries (n=232), from Northern as well
as Southern America (‘Americas’; n=56), from Asia (n=70), from the Middle East and Africa
(‘ME/Africa’; n=139).
Respondents’ origin is a key variable also in the outcome equation, as we seek to investigate
whether some groups are especially affected by CAD. Given that the number of COVID-19
infections increased massively during the pandemic, we also consider the epidemiological
week the respondent was surveyed. To investigate whether respondents resided in an area
where the risk of an infection was particularly high, we also merged information about the
average number of new COVID-19 cases during the last seven days per 100,000 inhabitants
of the administrative district. Given that this variable is heavily skewed to the left, we used
the natural logarithm of these values. 4 The information on the infection numbers is provided
on a daily basis by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). 5 RKI is a governmental scientific
institution in the field of biomedicine and the leading actor in the combat of the Corona
pandemic in Germany.

We added 1 to all figures before the logarithm to avoid the undefined logarithm of zero as the average
number of new COVID-19 cases during the last seven days was zero in some districts.

Results
Figure 1 provides some descriptive insights into the question whether immigrant groups in
Germany differ in their level of self-reported discrimination in general and during the Corona
pandemic in particular. For the more general account, on the left-hand side of the figure we
observe pronounced differences between the immigrant groups in Germany. While
respondents originating from Turkey, Africa, the Middle East or Asia report rather
pronounced discrimination in their everyday life, others, like respondents with a Polish origin
or from both American continents, report rather low levels of discrimination.
When focusing on the right-hand side of the figure, it becomes evident that especially one
group reports a pronounced increase in discriminatory behaviour against its members during
the COVID-19 pandemic and these are respondents of Asian origin. More than half of these
respondents report instances of CAD. This finding is particularly interesting when comparing
it to those groups which tend to otherwise report discrimination and which are identified as
the most discriminated groups in Koopmans et al’s (2018) field experiment. Only about 10
per cent of respondents from Turkey, Africa or the Middle East report instances of CAD.
Figure 1: Perception of CAD by countries of origin
- Figure 1 about here –
As outlined above, in order not to introduce bias by excluding those respondents who admit
that they have never experienced discrimination, in the multivariate analysis we estimate a
probit model with Heckman selection. We further investigate whether the CAD is more
pronounced when respondents reside in administrative districts with rather high infection
rates, i.e. where the risk of being infected is comparably high and the threat imposed by
COVID-19 is rather realistic. Model 1 in Table 1 displays the results of the initial model,
where only the country of origin and the epidemiological week (results not shown) is
9

included in the outcome equation. In the selection equation, we consider the highest parental
ISEI (HISEI) in the family, respondents’ educational background, their current situation and
gender. Focussing first on the selection equation, it becomes evident that, other things being
equal, respondents who originate in Turkey, Middle East, Africa and Asia report
discrimination, much like it has already been seen in Figure 1. However, also respondents
from the FSU and from ‘other European country’ report slightly higher rates of
discrimination in general. Regarding other covariates, respondents from families with a
higher ISEI-score report lower levels of discrimination. The same holds also true for
respondents with an upper secondary degree (as compared to those with a lower secondary
degree). Finally, unemployed respondents also report slightly higher rates of discrimination
as compared to those working full-time or part time.
- Table 1 about here –
When looking at the outcome question, we observe pronounced differences between
individuals of Asian descent and the German majority. Furthermore, also respondents from
the FYR and both American continents report an increase in discrimination during the
COVID-19 pandemic, although on a considerably lower level. 6
In model 2, we introduce the (natural logarithm) seven day-average of new cases in the
administrative district per 100,000 inhabitants. The coefficient is not statistically significant,
which suggests that residing in an area with high level of COVID-19 penetration is not
necessarily related to an increased CAD. Including this variable does not alter the results
presented in model 1.

Note that the difference between respondents of Asian descent and respondents from FYR is statistically
significant (p<0.01), while the difference between respondents of Asian descent and respondents from
Americas is only marginally significant (p=0.096).

In model 3, we interact the variable pertaining to the seven day-average of new cases in the
administrative district per 100,000 inhabitants with the country of origin variable to examine
whether the relationship between the potential threat of getting infected and CAD is origingroup specific. This interaction effect is statistically significant and positive for Asians,
respondents from the FSU and Americas, meaning that an increase in the number of new
COVID-19 cases in the administrative district is associated with an increase in reported CAD
among these groups. To visualize this interaction effect, we display predicted probabilities for
the category 4 of the dependent variable, i.e. the answer ‘yes’ to the question whether
respondents report increased discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic at different
levels of the natural logarithm of the average number of new cases during the last seven days
in the administrative district per 100,000 inhabitants. In order to keep the figure concise, we
only display the 95 per cent confidence interval for the interaction effect pertaining to
respondents of Asian origin. The three curves with a significant interaction effect are depicted
in black, while all non-significant interactions are displayed in grey. As can be seen, with an
increasing number of new COVID-19 cases in an administrative district, the probability for
respondents with Asian roots, as well as respondents from the FSU and Americas, reporting
an increased discrimination during COVID-19 pandemic increases considerably.
Figure 2: Predicted probabilities for outcome 4 (‘yes’) resulting from the interaction effect in
model 3
- Figure 2 about here However, how can we explain that interaction effects are statistically significant only for
these three groups, but not for other young people, for example those with Turkish or Polish
heritage? Figure 3 plots the development of the country-specific COVID-19 cases for
selected origin groups and—for the sake of reference—for Germany as a whole. We also

11

mark the start of the CILS4COVID study on the time axis. Based on the ITT we suggest that
both realistic and symbolic threats associated with the COVID-19 infection can explain the
increase in discrimination among some but not other groups.
As can be seen from Figure 3, the virus was prevalent in China (and some other Asian
countries) rather early but was quickly and effectively contained. From March onwards, the
number of COVID-19 cases rose tremendously in other parts of the world, surpassing the
official numbers reported in China and later on also in Germany rather rapidly in absolute
terms. This pertains to countries such as the US and starting from May 2020 also Russia.
Despite the spread of the virus, some other countries, e.g., Turkey and Poland have similar or
less pronounced dynamics (in absolute terms) of COVID-19 cases as Germany. Information
on the COVID-19 pandemic on the country level is easily accessible across the globe and
persistently communicated in the Germany media. Therefore, prejudices against respondents
originating from Americas or the former Soviet Union may be related to the realistic threat of
being infected by COVID-19, whereas respondents with Polish and Turkish roots would not
be perceived as of any particular threat, at least if compared to the rest of the German
population.
Figure 3: Development of absolute, cumulated numbers of COVID-19 cases in selected
countries
- Figure 3 about here CAD reported by Chinese and Asian immigrants in the beginning of the pandemic may have
been attributed to the perception of realistic threat of a COVID-19 contamination. But since
the absolute numbers of COVID-19 infections in China and in other Asian countries have
stagnated since early on, but the CAD did not disappear, the discriminatory behaviour against

12

respondents with an Asian background might no longer be attributed solely to the realistic but
rather to the symbolic threat.

Summary and conclusions
Using information from the add-on study CILS4COVID implemented in the course of the
CILS4EU-DE project, we have demonstrated that COVID-19 associated discrimination is
also an issue in Germany. Like in several other countries, individuals of Asian descent seem
to be particularly affected by CAD. Furthermore, we have shown that the level of selfreported discrimination depends—for some immigrant groups—strongly on the dynamics of
COVID-19 situation in the respondents’ residential area. Respondents with a (Northern or
Southern) American background, from the FSU and from Asian countries are more likely to
report CAD when the number of infections in the administrative district where they reside
increases. Given that the countries these individuals are believed to originate from have been
affected by COVID-19 (a) considerably stronger than Germany (in terms of the number of
COVID-19 cases) or (b) rather early in the pandemic, we conclude that CAD experienced by
these groups might happen in a reaction to both realistic and symbolic threats posed by the
virus.

Given the rather low number of cases for several immigrant groups and the skewed
distribution for most groups on the outcome variable, our results have to be taken with
caution. It has to be noted that the significant interaction effects for immigrants from FSU
and Americas may be driven by some few influential cases, while the interaction effect for
Asians is the most robust one. It can further be reported that sensitivity analyses with OLS
regression (and Heckman selection) confirm all three interaction effects for individuals from

13

the FSU, Americas and Asia. Still, the robustness of our findings needs to be confirmed with
larger immigrant samples, other age groups and other countries.
