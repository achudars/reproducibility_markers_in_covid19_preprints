"10" "Abstract"
"11" "Keeping p hysical  distance is  intended to mitigate the spread of  the Sars-CoV-2 virus . However, the impact  of a decrease in face-to-face interactions  on  non-physical  social contact s   of older people  remains unclear . In particular, we focus on intergenerational  contacts   that are particularly relevant  for  older people’s  mental health implications. Our analyses rely on an on-line representative survey conducted in Italy, Spain and France during April 14-24 2020. We considered the sub-sample of individuals aged 50+ (N=4,207). We calculated post-stratification weights based on official statistics and used logistic regressions to  analyse  how changes in intergenerational relationships differed by socio-economic factors in the three considered countries  and to what extent non-physical contacts (via phone, social media, etc.) have compensated the reduction in physical interactions. Finally,  changes in the use of digital devices  has  been explored as a consequence of both, decreased in physical and increased in non-physical intergenerational contacts.  Our findings are relevant to understand changes in intergenerational relationships during the pandemic and to better plan future outbreak responses."

"13" "Introduction"
"14" "I ntergenerational  contacts   an important  source of emotional and physical  support   for older people  (Antonucci et al 2007; Cooney & Dykstra, 2013) .  During the COVID-19 pandemic the possibility to meet with others has been limited due  to non-pharmaceutical interventions and guidelines devoted at fighting the spread of the  Sars-CoV-2 virus . In particular, several countries have adopted more or less stringent lockdown and physical distancing rules.  Consequently , intergenerational physical (face-to-face) contacts, as all types of contacts, have been reduced ( Del Fava et al 2020 ). This, together with other direct and indirect consequences of the pandemic, likely had a negative impact on older people’s mental health ( e.g., Brooks et al, 2020;  Sheffler  et al, 2020 ). In this context, it has been argued that non-physical intergenerational contacts  (e.g., via mobile phones)  may have played an important role in limiting the negative effects of reduced physical contacts on mental health (Arpino et al  2020 a )."
"15" "In this paper we aim at  exploring the heterogeneity  in changes in non-physical contacts according to older people’s characteristics and at  examining whether  -  and to what extent  -  older people’s non-physical intergenerational contacts have increased also to replace physical contacts with non-coresident individuals.  Finally, we study whether increased frequency of non-physical contacts stimulated an increased use of certain means of communications that are less commonly used by older people (video calls, instant text messaging, social media)."
"16" "Our research is based on a timely on-line survey carried out  in France, Italy and Spain  in April 2020,  during  the lockdown .  At the time of implementing the survey,   t hese countries  represented a  particularly interesting  setting  because they  were  the first  to be  strongly  hit by the pandemic outside Asia  ( Ceylan , 2020)  and consequently they were  the  first in Europe to lock down completely to reduce the  contagion  ( Hale et al. 2020 ). As a consequence of these strict measures, physical contacts have consistently reduced in all three countries, especially among older people (Del Fava  et al., 2020 ) ,  making  these three countries  particularly relevant for studying how and for  whom non-physical intergenerational contacts have increased during the lockdown."
"17" "Background"
"18" "The COVID-19 pan demic and changes in social contacts"
"19" "The SARS-CoV-2 virus originated in China in December 2019 and quickly spread across the globe causing more than  33  million cases and  1  million deaths up to  September  29 , 2020 . The necessity to contain the  diffusion  of the virus  and avoid over- burdening health care systems,  has raised important challenges for governments and societies that ad opted different  types of  non-pharmaceutical  responses."
"20" "A primary channel of virus transmission is through droplets expelled by infected people who  cough, sneeze, or speak   (Huang et al., 2020;  Peeri  et al., 2020) . Therefore,   physical contacts  have been considered risky and  people have been advised to keep distance from each other and stay at home (Kumar, 2020). To ensure that physical distance was respected, some  countries, as those we consider  in the empirical analyses ,  imposed different types of lockdown measures ."
"21" "According to  Evandrou  et al. (2020), the lockdown has brought disruption to daily life for the whole population and measures adopted to contain the virus are likely to leave their mark by producing detrimental effects on financial, relational, physical and  psychological domains. It has also been argued that vulnerabilities to COVID-19 are expected to be heterogeneous within the population ( Mikolai  et al, 2020)."
"22" "One of the most evident effect of interventions and guidelines to  address  the pandemic is the reduction of face-to-face (“physical”) contacts. Del Fava et al (2020) found that physical interactions have been consistently reduced in all countries  they  considered and among all age groups. However, the reduction was particularly strong in  t hose countries that adopted a full lockdown ( e.g.   France, Italy and  Spain ) .  Concerning differences  by age ,   they   found that  although  the  overall  contact  frequency   declined  across age  groups,  individuals aged 65+  we re those  experiencing a stronger reduction ."
"23" "The COVID-19 is particularly deadly for older people  (Guan et al, 2020),  especially those with  pre-existing health conditions (Clark et al 2020).  Therefore , policy and media  discourses  have  encouraged especially older people to limit their travel, movements and physical interactions (Ayalon 2020), putting them at a particular high risk of isolation.   Intergenerational relationships have been particularly accused to be potentially risk y for the transmission of the virus to older people . However,   Arpino et al . (2020 b )   argued  that evidence on the macro-level association is not clear cut and that  intergenerational relations   is a multidimensional  system  that do not exclusively involve physical contacts (Bengtson and Roberts 1991; Tomassini et al 2004).  Thus,  social contacts at a distance  may  have   become more common  during the lockdown as  an  instrument to enforce associational solidarity and as a way to deal with stress and depressive  feelings  (Arpino et al. 2020 a )."
"24" "Changes in non-physical intergenerational contacts during the COVID-19 pandemic:  Research questions"
"25" "From the previous discussion it emerges that  during the COVID-19 pandemic  older people have been invited or forced to reduce their physical contacts (intergenerational and not)   and empirical evidence  has shown  that they in fact did  so .  Our first research question is:  To what extent non-physical  intergenerational  contacts have, instead, increased?   And,  are changes in these contacts  heterogeneous?"
"26" "Previous studies have largely showed, before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, strong heterogeneities in intergenerational relationships, both within and across countries.  At the country-level, cultural norms and structural factors influence  the  size of social networks  and the frequency  of social contacts .    For example, p revious literature has  shown  the  relevan ce  of  familialisation , i.e., the strength of the normative  bonds with regard to  intergenerational  support   and care  ( Saraceno  and Keck 2010 ;  Dykstra  2018 )   by  finding   more frequent intergenerational  contact levels  reported   in  more  familialistic  countries ."
"27" "Within countries ,  differences exist by gender, age  and  socio-economic status.  For example, w omen  tend to have   more frequent s ocial contacts  than men   ( Barawnoska -Rataj  and  Abramowska‑Kmon , 2019 )  and older people’s   social contacts  tend to decline  over time  ( Barawnoska-Rataj  and  Abramowska‑Kmon , 2019 )  although  intergenerational ones  acquire a n even  higher importance  ( Antonucci et al 2014 ).  Socio-economic differences  have been  vastly  explored by existing studies ( see   Grundy, 2005 )  showing, for example, that  higher education  may be  associated with   reduced likelihood of weekly face-to-face contact with parents  ( Grundy   and Shelton ;  2001 ) ."
"28" "To what extent the known heterogeneities from the intergenerational  relationships  literature will also manifest in changes in  non-physical  intergenerational contacts during the pandemic is difficult to predict. Thus, we take an exploratory approach  but, in the analyses,  we account for most of the factors that are usually considered among the correlates of intergenerational contacts . Additionally, there is a nother reason to expect heterogeneous changes in non-physical intergenerational contacts  during the pandemic  linked   to  persistent technological divide ,  which do not only  refer  to internet access ,  but it also concerns  technolog ical   attitudes, skills and types of usage (van  Deursen  and van Dijk 201 5 ) . Our empirical analyses are based on an on-line survey, thus targeting a selected group of older people who have access to the internet. Still, within this group the frequency of use of digital communications and their type varies.  For example,  among 50+ individuals, younger age, men, high education and economic resources are associated with higher levels of  digital literacy  and  with  more regular use of internet  ( Halmdienst  et al., 2019 ; van  Deursen  and van Dijk 2015 ) ,   although these differences have somewhat reduced over time  ( Huxhold  et al. 2020) ."
"29" "O ur second research question is:  Do  reduced physical intergenerational contacts   associate with an  increase in non-physical intergenerational contacts among older people ?   Baldassar  et al. (2016) argue that  contacts  in proximate and  in  distant contexts  are not so different in terms of their power in generating  the   sense of a shared experience of everyday family  live s.  According to existing studies  on  ICT c o-presence  among transnational family members, regular non-physical contacts may  reinforce the feeling of belonging to  a  family network , and thus,  they  may decrease feeling s  of isolation  ( Nedelcu  and Wyss 2016 ;  Nedelcu  2017 ).  Thus, s ome  older people may have increased non-physical  intergenerational  contacts during the COVID-19 pandemic to (partially)  compensate for the reduction in physical interactions, which has subtracted a relevant source of emotional and practical support."
"30" "Our third question asks:  With what ties have non-physical contacts increased?   More specifically, we distinguish between contacts with children, grandchildren and (grand)parents for those who have at least one family member alive of the corresponding type of tie. The intergenerational relationship s  literature has documented continued and intensive contacts with children ( Grundy and Read 2012 ) , that also serve as a bridge for contacts with grandchildren ( Hank and Buber, 200 9).  Therefore, we may expect that especially non-physical contacts with children have raised during the pandemic to compensate for less physical interactions. Additionally, worries of risk of contagion , particularly dangerous for older individuals, may have stimulated more contacts with children and parents."
"31" "Finally, our  fourth  question is:  What type of digital communication form ha s  most often  increased ?  In particular, we investigate whether the use of  video calls, instant messaging applications and communications via social media  equally increased and whether changes in their use are associated with changes in non-physical intergenerational contacts. In other words, we are interested in understanding to what extent older people that increased their non-physical intergenerational contacts during the pandemic used all these three forms of communications or preferred some of them particularly."
"32" "Methods"
"33" "Study Population"
"34" "We implemented an online survey representative of the population aged 18 and more in France, Italy and Spain. In this study, we focus on the sub-sample of individuals aged  50+.  T he survey has been carried out through the on-line market survey platform called Lucid, that offers the opportunity to purchase samples for survey research, showing to produce high quality and rigorous data (Coppock and McClellan, 2019). More in details, Lucid  recruits  respondents following a three - step process (Callaghan, et al., 2019) starting with the collection of lists of potential survey respondents and with the request to take part in the Lucid panel. Then, on individuals who agreed to participate ,  Lucid collects a general set of variables such as gender, age, educational attainment and income and, finally, based on these information, Lucid invites individuals to participate to a particular survey using quota sampling. Namely, quota sampling implies the splitting up of the population into a number of sub-sets according to the characteristics we want to observe and in a way that the proportion of each sub-set in the sample is the same as in the population. This procedure ensures that the final sample is nearly identically distributed as the country benchmark."
"35" "As recommended in online survey research, we kept the questionnaire short to minimize non-responses and false responses (Revilla and Ochoa, 2017). More specifically, we set-up a 10-minute questionnaire focussed on changes in physical and non-physical intergenerational contacts during the lockdown. The survey was carried out in each country in the respective official language."
"36" "Since online surveys can only involve individuals who are online, agreed to become part of a sample and to take part into the specific study (Duffy et al. 2005), this   can lead to a coverage bias consisting in a misrepresentation of the target population. However, behind the fact that we had no real alternatives for data collection since face-to-face interviewing was not possible during the lockdown, Lucid targeted representativeness on age, gender, education and region of residence within each country  and we have additionally used post-stratification weights to minimize deviations from the benchmark population. Specifically, we used the STATA package “ ipfweight ” (Bergmann, 2011), to generate weights through an iterative procedure that performed stepwise adjustments of the weights until it has achieved, within countries, the margins of three population distributions: region of residence, age and gender, age and education."
"37" "The target sample was of 3,000 individuals per country. When restricting the sample to 50+ individuals, the sample size reduced to 1,473 for France, 1,511 for Italy and 1,223 for Spain. Data were collected during the lockdown, and specifically between 14th and 24th April 2020. The first nation-wide lockdown restrictions were implemented around mid-March in all three countries (Italy:  March 10, Spain: March 14; France: March 17)."
"38" "The analytic sample has been restricted to those who have not increased physical contacts nor decreased non-physical contacts during the lockdown. In fact, both groups are rather small (439 and 459 observations respectively). We also tried keeping them in the dataset and results did not substantially change."
"39" "More information on the survey  are  available at a dedicated website (https://sites.google.com/unifi.it/intergen-covid; see Arpino et al 2020c for descriptive  results on the full sample and the questionnaire)."
"40" "Dependent variable"
"41" "Individuals were asked about changes in their non-physical contacts  ( e.g.  on the phone, WhatsApp, Facebook)   during the COVID-19 lockdown with non-coresident individuals distinguishing between parents, grandparents, children and grandchildren. Our first dependent variable (Model 1 and Model 2) is a categorical variable taking value 1 if respondents increased the frequency of non-physical contacts since the entry into force  of the first nationwide restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and 0 otherwise with at least one non-coresident family member of other generations. In subsequent analyses we consider a similar categorical variable but for contacts with specific family members: children (Model 2a), grandchildren (Model 2b) and parents and/or grandparents (Model 2c)."
"42" "As an extension of the analysis, we considered if respondents increased  (=1) or not (=0)  non-physical contacts via specific means of communication: video calls (Model 3), instant messaging applications (Model 4) and social media (Model 5). Although for these variables we do not have specific information on with whom respondents have increased them, subsequent analyses have been conducted on subsamples based on whether respondents have or not specific family ties :  children (Models 3a/4a/5a), grandchildren (Model s  3b/4b/5b) and parents and/or grandparents  ( Model s  3c/4c/5c)."
"43" "Independent variables"
"44" "Similar to non-physical contacts, individuals were asked about changes in their physical (i.e., face-to-face) contacts during the COVID-19 lockdown with non-coresident parents, grandparents, children and grandchildren. In Model s  1 and 2, we included a categorical variable taking value 1 if respondents decreased the frequency of physical contacts with at least one non-coresident family member of other generations  during the  COVID-19 pandemic (“intergenerational physical contacts”, here thereafter) and 0 otherwise. In Model 2 coherently with the definition of the dependent variables, we accounted for the reduction in physical contacts specifically with children (Model 2a), grandchildren (Model 2b) and parents and/or grandparents (Model 2c)."
"45" "Other controls include socio-demographic variables such as respondents’ gender, age, country of residence,  subjective  economic situation (“living comfortably on present income”; “coping on present income”; “finding it difficult on present income”; “finding it very difficult on present income”) and the availability of kin (parents, children ,  grandchildren). We also controlled for the level of education (three levels based on the International Standard Classification of Education - “ low ”=  below secondary education, “medium” =  up to high-school and “high” =  university education or above) and for whether respondents were, or not, employed in the pre COVID-19 period. In addition, we included two health related variables with regard to the period antecedent to COVID-19 pandemic: respondents’ self-perceived health (0 = very good or good; 1 =  fair, poor or very poor) and  any reported  chronic disease (such as, heart disease, hypertension, stroke or cancer)."
"46" "In a robustness check (Table S.2 in the  Supplementary Material ) we also added variables accounting for events experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, obtaining similar results.  A set of dummy variables account ed  for whether respondents have experienced or not each of the following during the lockdown: “reduction in physical activity”; “worsened relation with partner”; “worsened relation with other people”; “suffered income loss”; “lost job”; “difficulties with organizing work or study from home”; “death of a relative or friend due to Coronavirus”; “a relative or friend was infected”; “had more time to spend with family”; “made new friends”; “re-established a relationship with a relative or friend”; “my life was not affected a big deal”. An additional variable account ed  for the severity level with which the region where respondents live was hit by the pandemic  according  to the  tertiles  of the distribution of Case-Fatality Rates (CFR) of COVID-19 at the regional level (NUTS-22)."
"47" "Statistical Analyses"
"48" "Descriptive analyses have been conducted to show the distribution of the analytic sample’s main characteristics. Then, we used logistic regression s  to examine associations between socio-demographic and health related individuals’ characteristics and the probability of increased intergenerational non-physical contacts during the lockdown (Model 1). Then, we added to the model a measure capturing any decrease in intergenerational physical contacts (Model 2). Subsequently, we differentiated intergenerational contacts into specific relationships as those with children for respondents who are parents (Model 2a; N = 2,397), grandchildren for those who are grandparents (Model 2b; N = 1,105) and with parents and/or grandparents for those who have at least one of them alive (Model 2c; N = 1,109). Then, additional analyses have been conducted to explore the association between changes in both, physical and non-physical intergenerational contacts and the use of media/digital devices such as video call (Model 3), instant messages (Model 4) and social media (Model 5). Finally, similarly to what it has been done for Model 2, estimates have been replicated for subsamples to differentiate intergenerational contacts into specific relationships as those with children (Model 3 a /4 a /5a; N = 2,397), grandchildren (Model 3 b /4 b /5b;   N = 1,105) and parents and/or grandparents (Model 3 c /4 c /5c; N = 1,109)."
"49" "Average marginal effects (AMEs) have been computed to complement estimated coefficients reported in regression tables, as well as predicted probabilities that are reported graphically in the  Supplementary Material . Post-stratification weights were used in all the analyses."
"50" "Results"
"51" "Weighted descriptive statistics for the main variables of interest are reported by country in Table 1. Concerning changes in intergenerational physical contacts,  a large share  of the respondents decreased the frequency of face-to-face contacts : about 50% in all three countries.  Physical contacts have been reduced especially with children (32%) and mainly in France (35%) compared to Italy (29%) and Spain (33%). Moreover, descriptive statistics show that a higher proportion of Italian and French respondents reported to have reduced physical contacts with grandchildren (26%) compared with Spanish ones (23%).  In all countries  the proportion of individuals aged 50+ who have reduced physical contacts with parents and/or grandparents during the lockdown  is around 18%."
"52" "Findings show that 49% of individuals aged 50+ have increased their intergenerational non-physical contacts during the lockdown displaying a slight heterogeneity by country. Indeed, an increase in intergenerational non-physical contacts was relatively more frequent in Spain (53%) and in France (49%) compared to Italy (46%, see Table 1).   With regard to contacts with different family ties, descriptive findings show that respondents aged 50+ have mainly increased non-physical contacts with children, especially in France (38%; compared with 37% in Spain and 31% in Italy)."
"53" "Finally, with respect to changes in the use of  digital forms of communications , a consistent share of respondents aged 50+ increased the use of video calls during the lockdown, especially in Spain (51%) and Italy (48%), while in France this percentage was lower (35%).  Also  the use of instant messages increased considerably and, again, this increase stronger in the two Mediterranean countr ies  as compared to France (66% in Spain, 56 %  in Italy vs 38% in France). Finally,  an  increased use of social media has been reported  by fewer  respondents (31% in Spain, 27% in Italy and 22% in France)."
"54" "< Table 1 about here >"
"55" "Table 2 displays results from logistic regression s  assessing associations between the probability of increased intergenerational non-physical contacts during the COVID-19 lockdown and individual’s socio-demographic and health characteristics (Model 1). To ease the interpretation of results, Figure S.1 in the  Supplementary Material  shows the predicted probabilities. Findings from Model 1 show that the likelihood of increased intergenerational non-physical contacts during the lockdown decreases with age (AMEs =   -0.037; p<0.1). In addition, respondents who have a medium educational level were about 8 percentage points more likely to report increased frequency of non-physical contacts with intergenerational kin compared to those with a higher educational level (p < 0.05). Individuals living in Italy and in France showed a lower predicted probability to report increased non-physical contacts of about 5 percentage points compared to their counterpart living in Spain (p < 0.001). Finding it difficult to live on present income is associated with a lower probability of increased frequency of intergenerational non-physical contacts of about 7 percentage points (p < 0.001) compared to coping on present income. In addition, respondents with a partner were about 5 percentage points more likely to have increased non-physical contacts compared to those without a partner (p<0.001; Figure S.1, Panel  a  in the  Supplementary Material ).  The probability of increased non-physical contacts during the lockdown was about 21 percentage points higher among those with at least one alive parent (p< 0.001; Figure S.1, Panel b in the  Supplementary Material ). Finally, compared to respondents having only children, those without children nor grandchildren were about 28 percentage points less likely to have  increased virtual contacts during the lockdown while those with both, children and grandchildren, were 14 percentage points more likely to have increased them (Figure S.1. Panel c in the  Supplementary Material )."
"56" "< Table 2 about here >"
"57" "Results from Model 2  (Table 3)  show that the decrease of intergenerational physical contacts - in general - during the lockdown among individuals aged 50+ was positively associated with the increased frequency of non-physical contacts. Predicted probabilities drawn from Model 2 show that respondents who have decreased face-to-face intergenerational contacts were about 34 percentage points more likely to have increased virtual contacts (p< 0.001; Figure S.2 in the  Supplementary Material )."
"58" "Subsequent models in  T able  3  show findings of logistic regressions implemented on specific subsamples to distinctly look at contacts with children (Model 2a), grandchildren (Model 2b) and parents and/or grandparents (Model 2c). Overall, the association between decreased physical contacts and increased non-physical contacts is strong and statistically significant, but it shows a meaningful heterogeneity based on with whom the frequency of contacts has changed. Specifically, we found that – among parents - respondents who decreased the frequency of physical contacts with children were about 43 percentage points more likely to have increased virtual contacts with them during the lockdown. Similar findings were found for contacts with parents and/or grandparents (AMEs = 0.420; p<0.001) if they were alive while the predicted probability of increased non-physical contacts with grandchildren was 35 percentage points higher for those who  decreased physical contacts with them if respondents were grandparents (AMEs = 0.351; p< 0.001)."
"59" "< Table 3 about here >"
"60" "Then, we have estimated the association between changes in intergenerational physical and non-physical contacts and the increased use of digital during the lockdown (Table 4). Predicted probabilities drawn from adjusted logistic regressions show that respondents who have increased intergenerational non-physical contacts were about 21 percentage points more likely to have increased video calls (Model 3; Figure S.3, Panel  a  in the  Supplementary Material ), 15 percentage points more likely to have increased the use of instant messages (Model 4; Figure S.3, Panel b in the  Supplementary Material ) and about 13 percentage points more likely to have increased the use of social media (Model 5; Figure S.3, Panel c in the  Supplementary Material ). By distinctly looking at the frequency of contacts with different family ties according to whether respondents have or not these ties, we noticed that the increased frequency of non-physical contacts with grandchildren was particularly relevant : they were  22  percentage points more likely to have increased use of video calls  (Model 3b) and   11 percentage points  more likely to have increased use of  instant messages and social media   (Model s  4b and 5b)."
"61" "Respondents who decreased intergenerational physical contacts during the lockdown were about 10 percentage points more likely to have increased video calls (AMEs = 0.088; p<0.001; Figure S.4, Panel  a  in the  Supplementary Material ) and instant messages (AMEs = 0.097; p<0.001; Figure S.4, Panel b in the  Supplementary Material ). However, a non-statistically significant association was found between having decreased  intergenerational physical contacts and the use of social media (AMEs = 0.003; p>0.1; Figure S.4, Panel c in the  Supplementary Material) . Moreover, our findings show that the predicted probability to increase video calls and instant messages was particularly high among those who have decreased physical contacts with grandchildren (AMEs = 0.085; p< 0.05 and AMEs = 0.119; p<0.001, respectively) if they were grandparents."

"63" "Conclusion"
"64" "Non-pharmaceutical interventions to contrast the diffusion of the Sars-CoV-2 virus had a strong impact on social contacts. We examined how non-physical intergenerational contacts have changed during the pandemic in three countries that implemented complete national lockdown: France, Italy and Spain. Our analyses are based on the sub-sample of individuals aged 50+ of an on-line survey carried out during the lockdown period."
"65" "Consistent with other research ( e. g.  Del Fava et al. 2020), our data show that physical intergenerational contacts have decreased during the lockdown for about 50% of older people in all three countries analysed. However, non-physical intergenerational contacts have instead increased, especially for those who decreased face-to-face contacts, which suggests a sort of “compensation” effect. This effect was particularly strong among older people who reduced physical interactions with their children."
"66" "Changes in non-physical contacts were not homogeneous. Individuals of younger age, with medium level of education, with a better (subjective) economic situation displayed higher probabilities of increased non-physical intergenerational contacts as compared to their counterparts."
"67" "A large share of older people has increased their use of video calls and instant messages, while only fewer increased the use of social media. The increased use of these digital forms of communication was  much more evident in Italy and Spain than in France. This may be due to a lower pre-COVID use of these tools in Southern European countries (see e.g.,  Vulpe  and  Crăciun , 2020). This sort of “catching-up” effect is similar to what has been observed in studies on digital divides showing narrowing gaps by age and education over time ( Huxhold  et al.  2020)."
"68" "Older people that increased non-physical intergenerational contacts as compared to those who did not , were more likely to increase the use of digital forms of communications. Although we do not have information on the persons contacted through these digital tools, the existing evidence suggests that the goal of increasing intergenerational relationships at a distance during the pandemic has stimulated a higher use of digital devices, consistently with what has been found in pre-COVID studies ( Huxhold  et al, 2020). This effect was particularly strong for those who increased non-physical contacts with grandchildren and, in terms of tools, for video calls, which may be due to the fact that video calls allow to manifest affect in a way that resembles physical contacts (Peng et al 2018;  Quadrello  2005), that had to be reduced during the pandemic.   Existing studies on the role of digital devices as a tool to shorten geographical distance between (grand)parents and (grand)children have shown that ,  although non-physical, virtual contacts may reinforce family ties ,  emotional support and solidarit y  among generations  by increasing older people’s agency with regard to family decisions and actions ( Nedelcu  and Wyss 2016;  Nedelcu  2017). While a lower increase in the use of social media as compared to other technologies may also be related to a resistance against this tool by groups of older people ( Vulpe  and  Crăciun , 2020 )."
"69" "Limitations of our study include the fact that, being based on an on-line survey, our results may not generalize to the whole population of older people.  It may be that older people that were not connected to the internet started to use digital forms of communications during the COVID-19 pandemic, so their non-physical contacts may have increased even more than their counterparts already connected. Alternatively, it may be that older people who were not internet users found it more difficult to increase their social contacts at a distance. Future studies using retrospective surveys may investigate  these relevant aspects. Another limitation is due to the need of keeping the questionnaire as short as possible for our online survey. Thus, we were not able to account for some aspects that may be explored in future studies such as, for example, the frequency of contacts before and after the lockdown."
"70" "Despite these limitations, our study demonstrates that the COVID-19 pandemic produced relevant indirect impacts on intergenerational contacts, trough the non-pharmaceutical measures to fight the spread of the Coronavirus. On the one hand, physical distancing had a negative impact on face-to-face intergenerational contacts. On the other hand, social distancing implied by less face-to-face interactions has been compensated by more non-physical  social  contacts with (grand)children and (grand)parents. Our study also highlights important heterogeneities within the older population in the increase of intergenerational contacts at a distance. These results have several important implications for researchers and policy makers. Our findings show that the COVID-19 pandemic had ambiguous impacts on intergenerational relationships. Models of intergenerational solidarity stress the importance of considering its complex and multidimensional nature. Physical co-presence is a necessary condition to realize some forms of intergenerational solidarity, such as provision of personal care, but not for others, such as provision of  emotional support. The social control function of intergenerational relations can also be exerted, at least to some extent , at a distance. Future studies will examine what the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on intergenerational relationships are, and how intergenerational solidarity and conflicts have been affected by the direct and indirect  consequences  of the pandemic."
"71" "In terms of policy implications, our study clearly demonstrates the importance of technologies that allow older people to maintain social contacts also at a distance. Other studies have found that non-physical social contacts have been crucial for reducing the negative mental health consequences of lockdown on older people (Arpino et al 2020 a ). The heterogeneity that we find in changes in nonphysical intergenerational contacts is probably in part related to technological divides in terms of age and socio-economic status (see e.g.,  Huxhold  et al. 2020). Policies and interventions devoted at reducing existing digital divides may help older  people to keep intergenerational ( and  other) contacts at a distance which is particularly relevant for older individuals who have to cope with situations of isolation and may result especially crucial in the future ,  in case similar lockdown measures will be required."
