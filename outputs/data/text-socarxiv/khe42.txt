"6" "ABSTRACT"
"7" "Little attention has been paid to   interactions between institutional-human-environment dimensions , which  are believed to impact the outcome of COVID-19 abatement. Thus,   through the diagnostic SES framework analysis ,  this paper aims to investigate what and how the multifaceted social, physical, and governance factors affect the  success level  of 7 selected Asia-Pacific countries   (namely South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia, and New Zealand) in c ombatting the COVID-19 pandemic .  Drawing on  secondary data   from February 2020 to June 2020 , t he success  or severity  level of a country was  measured   by  cumulative positive cases, average daily increase, and  the  mortality rate .  A qualitative content analysis ,  covering  cod e assignation , i.e., Present (P), Partially Present (PP) ,  Absent (A)  for each SES attribute,  as well as  rank ordering  (from 1 st  to 7 th )   and  score  calculation  (from 3 to 21)  for  the success level  between  the countries ,   was undertaken.   A ttributes (design principles) of SES factors,  such as   past experiences  facing similar diseases , facilities mobility, lockdown measures,   penalty,  and standard of procedures in public spaces  are  deemed significant  in determining the  abatement outcome or severity  of a country . The findings show  that  Vietnam  (1 st )  and New Zealand  (2 nd )  adopt ing  most of the design principles  of governance  (with the scores of 15 and above)   h ad  successfully eliminated the virus, while Indonesia  (7 th )   and Japan  (6 th )  were  deemed least  successful  (scoring between 3-9) , likely  due to  the  low presence frequency of design principles .  Not only does the study validate  SES framework  adaptability  in a health-related (non-commons) setting ,   where   some design principles used in resource /commons  governance  are  also  relevant   in explaining the  COVID-19 outcome ,  the  critical attributes of  institutional-social-ecological  factors   are  highlighted , ultimately  helping policymakers devise   more strategic measures to   address  the crisis."

"9" "INTRODUCTION"
"10" "COVID-19 was unknown to the masses prior to its first case in  December 2019   (World Health Organization, 2020b)  although there were  speculati ons that the earliest case dated  back to  November 2019  (Brynner, 2020; Li et al., 2020) . It was first regarded as viral pneumonia but was then  analysed  to be a viral infection  and  has the capability to be transmitted through human to human interaction  (Shereen et al., 2020) ."
"11" "As of June 2020, there  were  countries that had successfully mitigated the problem, while some  were  struggling and  had failed  due to countless reasons. Much emphasis  has been  put on the science and  pharmaceutical  aspect in effort to produce vaccines to cure the pandemic, although it is believed that social  behaviours , despite being intangible, indirect and qualitative,  leaning towards  prosociality ,  via  a  cooperative action can also cont ribute to curbing the pandemic  (Ling & Ho, 2020) . Through this research, an integration between health and the  systemic  institutional-social-ecological (SES) framework was carried out, apart from knowing its relevancy when applied outside its commons domain, specifically to identify answers to the following research question __  How the diagnostic IAD-SES  framework can help answer the level of success or failure of countries in curbing the pandemic? It has come to attention that there is a noticeable gap of research in exploring what and how institutional-social-ecological dimensions of the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD)  or SES   framework help  understand  the unprecedented crisis. More precisely, given with numerous exogenous factors, this study  identifies  which SES attributes (design principles) are signific ant and effective in explaining and thus curbing  the pandemic.  The framework, synonymous with commons and resource management or collective action, is rarely applied in a  health  and disease- related topic , such as COVID-19;  relationships between the transmissi on of COVID-19, socio-economic  and e nvironmental factors should be demystified  in order to devise a  holistic  strategy in mitigating the problem."
"12" "The Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD)  and  SES  framework are both founded by  Elinor   Ostrom  (1990).  The former , mostly adopted by social scientists, is  primarily  used to evaluate the effects of alternative institutional   arrangements. It was envisioned as a tool for scholars of different disciples to communicate with each other regardless of their broad pers pective to pave a way towards  better understanding   of a situation  (Cole et al., 2019) .  Within the framework , it is important to understand the  action   situation /interaction  that actors are in,  plausible choices  made by them and  how it will affect the pattern of the outcome . In order to predict choices that will be made, it is crucial to know: (1)  the resources brought into the situation , (2)  the valuation assigned by the actor to the state of the world and to  the  action;  (3)  how the actors acquire, process, retain and use the knowledge and information;  and (4 ) ways used by the actor in selecting a particular decision   (Mcginnis et al., 1992) ."
"13" "The IAD framework , however,  is  criticized as  it lacks  in terms of diversity and complexity  of natural system and processes  (Cole et al., 2019) . Therefore,  SES is an improved  version building upon the  IAD framework by  expanding the  basic  variables into more relevant categories  as shown in Figure 1 .   The SES framework provides a more  detailed variable oriented analysis  of the social-ecological system  (Cole et al., 2019) .  The community and governance attribute s  in the  IAD context have been maintained as social and  governance system s  in an SES ,  while biophysical /ecological  attribu tes converge  into two sections,  which are resource systems and resource units.  SES,  normally applied in the context of commons or CPRs governance,  is proven to be   versatile and adaptable , due to its generality. It also enables  a comparison of different settings  in a study where data are collected with the means to compare  (Partelow, 2018) ."

"15" "By  adopting the SES  framework, i t allows researchers to have an  organized variable-orient ed and process-oriented  line of arguments,  involving  systematic  networks of action situations ,   and  hence a more informed decision  (Cole et al., 2019; Tashman, 2020) . When adapted into the c ontext of COVID-19,  the instit utional-socio-ecological attributes  (e.g., penalty, lockdown, facilities, technology, and population density,  and  past knowledge) and their interaction  (e.g., monitoring, communication, swab testing, containment enforcement)  would  influence  the  number of cumulative cases ,  average daily increase , and the  mortality rate  and  thus  translate the  success level   of a country into low, medium and high,  as diagrammatized in Figure 2."
"16" "FIGURE   2.  The SES framework in the COVID-19 context. Source: Adapted from  McGinnis and  Ostrom  (2014)"
"17" "Theoretically, design principles  (DP) or critical success factors  that are present in a successful resource management should also exist in successful pandemic containment and mitigation. The hypothesis was that the higher the amount /frequency  of design principles  (successful attribute)  that  are  present or occur in countries , the higher the success level of them curbing the pandemic.  Despite all these, research focusing on socio-economic and socio-ecological drivers of  the  COVID-19 transmission remains scarce when in fact, it does hold an equal ly important role as a critical determinants  of COVID-19 transmission risks.  Although few studies link  both socio-e cological and climate factors with  transmission levels of COVID-19, a study had proven that the latter  (climatic factor)  does not affect significantly,  and  hence its absence in this paper  (Su et al., 2020) .  Therefore, this study attempts to contribute theoretically and methodologically by expanding the application of  the  SES framework and its institutional-social-ecological design principles in the COVID-19 context. Studying these factors   should also  be of practical significance because  the findings can serve as a guide/reference that helps  forecast the COVID-19 outcome more accurately as to whether a country is likely to fail or succeed in addressing the pandemic . Ultimately, this study  enables researchers and policymakers to devise more holistic and effective strategies  to  reduce  and  prevent similar incidents  in the future. T he following sections of the paper  further elaborates  the topic in terms of  ( i )  study areas,  (ii)  methods of data collection and analysis,  (iii) results,  findings,  and discussions ,  and  (iv)  lastly a conclusion."
"18" "METHODOLOGY"
"19" "STUDY AREA S"
"20" "Via a  thorough literature review a comparative study  was carried out  between the selected countries located  in Asia Pacific. This study has  enlisted  Japan ,  Korea ,  Malaysia ,  Singapore ,  Vietnam ,  Indonesia , and  New Zealand  as study areas and classified them  into three categories, namely  countries ( i ) that had successfully flattened the curve, (ii) attempting to flatten the curve, and (iii) that  failed  to flatten the curve.  Such categorization was  based on their  cumulative cases ,  daily average increase  and  mortality rate.  Table 1 illustrates an overall  data of the three crite ria for  each country. In general, Vietnam fared the best with 0.9 average cases as of 30 th  June and 0% mortality rate as illustrated in Figu re 4 and Figure 5. Figure 3 has  shown that the cumulative cases  of Vietnam were also at the lowest, i.e.,  355. The government’s swift and strict measures had proven to be  successful  as the country was one of the earliest to eliminate the virus  (Roser et al., 2020) . Meanwhile, Indonesia record ed  a cumulative case of 49 000 with a daily average increase of 1000 cases,  and these number was the  highest among the seven countries. However, its mortality rate comes second after Japan.  Next paragraph provides brief background for each country as to how COVID-19 cases started to emerge."

"61" "Cases of COVID-19 had first emerged in these countries from early January to the end of February. In some countries, COVID-19 was brought in by Chinese nationalities or i ndividuals returning from China ,   such as in Singapore, New Zealand, and Japan  (Henrickson, 2020; World Health Organization, 2020a) . Indonesia recorded its first case after a nationality came in contact with an infected person in Malaysia  (Channel News Asia, 2020b) . Even so, Japan was the first to record a human-to-human transmission as its first case did not visit the market but was in close contact with a pneumonia patient  (World Health Organization, 2020a) .   In som e countries, the first case did  not necessarily lead to a booming number of cases. In Malaysia, cases started to skyrocket  due to  a religious event in Sri  Petaling  in March, attended by almost 16000 individuals from Malaysia and others  (Free Malaysia Today, 2020) . The same phenomenon  occurred  in South Korea when an elderly woman in Daegu  was  tested positive for the virus.  She attended a 10000  member mass gathering   at  the  Shincheonji  Church   (Levkowitz, 2020) ."
"62" "DATA COLLECTION"
"63" "To execute a comparative study, we had outlined  at total of  14  attributes ,  such as  population size  and density ,  homogeneity ,  trust and reciprocity ,  local management knowledge and experience ,  foreign worker clusters  influx containment ,   mobility ,  technology ,  economy ,  local leadership ,  penalty ,  lockdown ,  standard of procedure (SOP) in public areas , and  emergency response plan . These attributes were based on the IAD-SES framework which had been localized to the COVID-19 context. This study made use of secondary sources, such as research papers, government documents, newsletters, and official websites. Keywords such as ‘IAD-SES framework’, ‘Social-ecological system’, ‘COVID-19’ were used on Google  Scholar to garner information. Other than that, we also referred to  ourworldindata.org  to collect statistical data on cumulative cases, mortality rate, testing rates,  and  daily average increase of cases.  The  Government Response Stringency Index  was also referred to as it was used as important data input for the “interaction or action arena” of the SES framework ,  prior to explaining the COVID-19 outcome of a country .  It is worth noting that  data extracted only cover  information  from the month of February 2020 to June 2020 . The specific timeline was chosen as  most country cases were at a peak  during that period."
"64" "DATA ANALYSIS"
"65" "The study employed a qualitative content analysis to study institutional-social-ecological  attributes ,   using   Ostrom’s  8 design principles ( Ostrom , 1990)  as  one of the  theoretical  underpinning s . To  aid the analysis , a coding system was used to determine IAD based SES attributes in each country.  According to suitability and relevancy, e ach  attribute   was assigned with a code  based on a ratio or percentage of DP presence/occurrence ,   i.e.,  Absent (A)  (with 0%-29%) , Partially Present (PP)  (with 30%-69%)  or Present (P)  (with 70%-100%). The coding process ,  adapted from  Gari’s  et al., (2017)  methodology,  was  undertaken  in a  rather  intuitive or subjective manner , especially when data were inconsistent and unavailable .   Ultimately,  i n line with  Ostrom’s  successful commons governance  focusing  on the importance of  the presence of design principles,   a  higher frequency /occurrence  of P indicates a better COVID-19 containment, and therefore  a  higher success rate  of  the country, while a low er  count of P  connoting a higher frequency of A or PP  means otherwise ."
"66" "At the same time, t he suc cess level of a country  was measured  and determined  based  on  the  total  score s obtained  from the three criteria, namely  the  cumulative number of cases  of each country, the  day to day average increase ,  and  the  mortality rate  of the country. More precisely, the total scores were   calculated  based on   the  ranking  (i.e., 1 st  to 7 th )  and values assigned (from 1 to 7)   to each criterion .  Table 2  summarizes the  options of  value s  for each  rank as well as  the  score range s  (from 3 to 21)  for  the  high,  medium,  and low outcome s, respectively ."

"322" "Based on a study done by  Kadi  and  Khelfaoui  in Algeria, population density indeed plays a role in the transmission of virus  (Kadi & Khelfaoui, 2020) . However, it cannot be a strong  explanatory factor as to why the number of cases are as known  (Bouba-Olga, 2020) . Among the 7 countries, Singapore has the highest population density  ( 8358 per  km 2 )  as shown in  Table 3 . Despite the  hi gh population density, the country having  adequate facilities and economic strength  managed to keep the number of positive cases and the death rate under control .  In contrast, Indonesia fumbled  despite having  a lower population density due to the shortage of  facilities and economy."
"323" "HIGH  SOCIAL  HOMOGENEITY"
"324" "Based on  Table 3  above, Vietnam, South Korea,  and Japan were justified as P because their populations appear to be  relatively   homogenous  in terms of culture and some demographic attributes  (ethnics and language) . Meanwhile ,  other countr ies were considered as  PP due to their   multicultural and racial settings ,  such as Malaysia, Indonesia, New Zealan d, and Singapore. Culturally,  Japanese had always upheld a  high standard of hygiene and obedience . They have always practiced social distancing as they respect personal space. Wearing masks when feeling sick is a norm to prevent contracting the virus to others  (Tashiro & Shaw, 2020) . Therefore, there are no objections  among its citizens when mask rules were enforced  by the government. However, to posit the  homogeneity  of a nation contributes positively  to the rate of success , it  seems  rather  farfetched as the analysis had shown that it does not play a major role."

"343" "Table  4  is an extension of  Table 3 ,  explain ing  the  level of trust and reciprocity   owned by each country .  Having trust from the people ensures that the public follows the rules undisputed ly  (i.e., higher compliance) , allowing the leaders to convince them of mass testing and q uarantines before it gets worse and  hence keeping the virus at bay earlier on  (Kleinfeld, 2020) .  In other words, having citizens’ high trust towards the government may contribute positively to the success level of a country in curbing the pandemic. T he trust level of each country  was  based on Edelman’s Barometer report 2020 and the Guardian.  For example, countries like Singapore and  New Zealand are deemed to have trust due to  transparency  and the  leader’s excellent risk communication . Meanwhile,  other countries’  government s  (Malaysia, South Korea and Vietnam)  had  constantly prove n their  competency,  hence garnering public trust in their capabilities  (Hong, 2020; Kleinfeld, 2020; Levkowitz, 2020; Tran et al., 2020; Woo, 2020) .  In Vietnam, the people believe that the government is working for the betterment of the country; the Vietnamese government is also competent in providing prompt communication and medical supplies thus allowing them to carry out strategies similar to wealthier countries despite being a lower income nation (Kleinfeld, 2020)."
"344" "Despite being  placed in the most trust category (Table  4 ), the Republic of Indonesia has been speculated to hide the real number of cases in the country by activists and political opponents  (Aljazeera, 2020) . This had led us to code Indonesia  PP  for this attribute . Japan’s government too, faced the same problem . The  government was labelled distrustful by the barometer ,  and this was further back ed up by a poll done by NHK, where the survey  stated that more than half o f the population disapproved  the  Prime Minister’s and his government’s ways in handling the pandemic  (The Economist, 2020) ."

"403" "Sufficient  l ocal management kn owledge and experience  are mostly  present in   all seven countrie s  as seen in  Table 3 .  It was found that  most countries  have  had experience s in  handling  outbreaks ,  such as SARS ,   Measles  and H1N1 (Table  5 ) .   These experience s  helped them  improve their healthcare system in infection   prevention and control ,  activate response protocol s ,  increase number of thermal scanners  at all borders and  realized the importance of isolating infected cases  and  quarantine measures   (Bernama, 2020; Hong, 2020; Rahman, 2020) .  This means that  countries  with the past experi ences in handing related pandemic contagions can better cope with COVID-19.  Contrary to other countries, Japan had opted for lesser testing based on its experience in handling a pandemic. Previous outbreaks had seen the public flock ing the hospitals to get tested increasing the transmission risks. Thus, t he Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare  was  concerned that crowded hospital lobbies would lead to a surge of COVID-19 cases  and  hence finalized their decision to limit accessibility  (Nippon , 2020) ."
"404" "EFFECTIVE  FOREIGN WORKERS  INFLUX CONTAINMENT"
"405" "Table 3  had stated that both Malaysia and Singapore had a large influx of foreign workers which leads to clusters of COVID-19 cases .  If there is a  proper con tainment system of the worker, it  would be indicated as  P. On the other hand, other countries marked N/A which means this attribute is not applicable as they did not have a huge influx of foreign workers leading to COVID cluster emergence.  A proper containment system  help s  eradicate possibilities of a surge of cases  therefore controlling the number of cumulative cases and maintaining a low mortality rate."
"406" "The rise of a foreign worker cluster in Singapore was apparent from 15 th  to 30 th  March, with almost 61% imported case s . Singapore has over a million foreign workers with most of them living in  cramped housing   (Koh, 2020) .  Both Malaysia and Singapore had cited  poor living condition as a  factor  that had sparked a widespread infection among the group  (Malay Mail, 2020b) .   The severity of cases  in Malaysia  had forced the government to employ a more stringent lockdown, called  the  Enhanced Movement Control Order (EMCO)  (Sandanasamy et al., 2020) ."

Having a n   ample  amount   of  resources (physicians and facil i ties)  allow s   more patients to be treated at one time ,  hence ensuring the best healthcare services to all. Therefore,  the  COVID - 19  mortality rate  could be lowered.   Generally, high-income countries like South Korea, Singapore and Japan  possessed   sufficient  health facilities  and  manpower (Table  6 ),  except for  New Zealand  and Japan   (Mazey & Richardson, 2020; The Conversation, 2020) .

The country’s Ministry of Health had recognized an uneven distribution of health facilities  and quality  across Indonesia  (Pisu, 2010; Setiati & Azwar, 2020) .  Some  sub-districts in Ind onesia did  not possess any health centre and lack necessities such as electricity, clean water, and proper equipment  with  limited transportation  (United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs & The United Nations Resident Coordinator Office, 2020) .  Obvious  disparity  between  rural areas  and  urban regions   is  common  in many countries   i.e.,  Kuala Lumpur.

Seen in Table  7 , most of the countries had opted for comprehensive tracing ,  while Indonesia ’s  and Japan’s testing capacity  was  limited   (Roser et al., 2020) .   A comprehensive tracing allows more cases to be detected  (or swab tested)  which can be done through  integration of an application .  The efficiency of contact tracing applications is  high  as  a  study shows that  MySejahtera  has uncovered 251 confirmed COVID-19 cases or 3% of 8308 cases as of June  (Boo, 2020) ."

Next, d rive-thru testing is proven that this system is efficient as South Korea recorded a higher testing number as 50 drive-thru testing facilities were set up as of April 20  (Hong, 2020) . In addition, most countries  produce  their own personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators as global supplies dwindl e and most manufacturing companies focused  on meeting their own country’s needs  (Nikkei Asia, 2020) .

In Vietnam, the role of the governmen t is very apparent as they were  authoritarian in handling the pandemic. The government is more aggressive in enforcing laws without any delay and public debate  (Cerre, 2020) .  The  Vietnamese government had no problem mobilizing their military for health care missions while enforcing strict restrictions publicly.

"705" "An emergency response plan in  a  pandemic situation is crucial to ensure  an  effective control of the pandemic.  Table 3   shows  that all countries had devised  their  own emergency response plan, denoted as P. Among popular forms of emergency response plan are  debt relief and income support  by the government as stated in Table 1 2 .  Having a broad relief help s  decrease the citizen’s movement as  they  can stay home without worrying much about their financial conditions. Restricting movement proves to be an excellent circuit breaker to the virus transmission."
"706" "As a step to preparing for the worse, the governments also called up for the increase of healthcare facilities by  turning buildings into quarantine  centre s , mobilizing more labs for testing and research purposes   (Abe, 2020; Ngoc Thanh & Tat Dinh, 2020; Rahman, 2020) . For example, Indonesia had repurposed a truck into a laboratory to increase testing rates  (The Jakarta Post, 2020) . The Korean and Malaysian healthcare had also transformed a few hospitals into special COVID-19 hospitals  (Elengoe, 2020; Her, 2020) ; thus,  specialized healthcare worker s  could  prioritize  treating COVID-19 patients  until recovery."
"707" "INTERACTION ARENA"
"708" "In addition to  the SES  attributes  described above ,  efficient monitoring, communication, movement restriction and  extensive contact tracing and testing  as part of the interaction   arena  (activities/process as a result of the SES attributes),  sourced from the  Government Stringency Index by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker ,  were used as  supplemental  evidence and reference   to   further  explain  th e outcome  of each country .  The same  coding system  shown in the analysis section was used, where  code  P  was  used to represent  data  with 70-100 score .  Meanwhile,  PP represents data with 40-69 score ,  while A  denotes a score ranging  0- 39 .   The data  varied  every month ;  hence ,  the highest score  was   considered  when  assigning the code .   New Zealand had recorded the highest stringency score at 96, followed by Singapore at 85,  Vietnam at 83, Indonesia at 80,  South Korea and Malaysia at 75, and Japan at 47. A high stringency reflects a n effective monitoring ,  in general.  Meanwhile,   Singapore had  the highest containment index  with a score of  86, followed by  New Zealand at 83, South Korea at 79, Malaysia at 77, Indonesia at 73 and  finally  Japan at 44.   Furthermore, Si ngapore had  the highest testing rate , followed by New Zealand, Vietnam,  Malaysia, South Korea, Japan and lastly Indonesia.  Also ,  all countries  practice a  coordinated information campaign, which  promotes effective communication between the government and citizens."
"709" "CONCLUSION  AND RECOMMENDATIONS"
"710" "The primary objective of this study  was  to explain COVID-19 from an SES perspective, hence  testing out   the framework’s adaptability in the health and medical  setting. Through the framework, seven Asia Pacific countries were reviewed for institutional-socio-ecological factors which affect their success in fighting the pandemic. Due to the adherence to  or high presence  (P)  frequency of  the design principles,  both  Vietnam  and New Zealand classified as countries with  the  high success level of COVID-19 abatement  are  coherently   explainable . Meanwhile,  Japan and Indonesia , with low presence (P) frequency,   were   deemed as  countries with   the  low success level ."
"711" "Although some countries possessed a  high number of Ps  for certain design principles /attributes , the outc ome signified that they may  not necessarily and  ideally  abate the pandemic  (e.g., South Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia)  as what have been hypothesised .  Thus, three lessons can be drawn: ( i ) having  high number/frequency of Ps for SES attributes does not always constitute them a panacea for the pandemic;  (ii)  however, although the presence of attributes may not always lead to success, it would be detrimental to a country for not having them; and lastly (iii)   some  attributes  ( mostly  from the governance factor)   may  have a heavier weigh tage  (more significant)  towards  explaining the success level. More precisely,   the c ommon effective traits (or critical succe ss factors/design principles) found in   Vietnam and New Zealand  are ultimately about the implementation of  lockdown ,  penalties ,  strict public standard of procedure s ,  strong  leadership,   trust and reciprocity  between  government and citizens,  comprehensive testing ,   efficient  mobilized facilities ,  and past  experience s in other related contagions.    The e conomic situation of a country does play a vital role in keeping the pandemic under control but  Vietnam  demonstrated otherwise or is  a n  ‘ anomaly ’   in handling their COVID-19 situation,   given its status as a  lower middle income  nation  by the World Bank . Meanwhile,  low success outcome countries such as Japan an d  Indonesia  are associated with the  lack  of   national  lockdown implementation  and   low testing   rates,  and spe cifically in Indonesia, due to its poverty and economic situations, it faced   inadequate facilities and resources,  and  manpower to contain the pandemic . Other factors such population size and  density, effective foreign workers’ influx containment, homogeneity,  and emergency response plan  are not as impactful  and significant as the above factors ."
"712" "By understanding and identifying which are the most significant SES factors, this comparative study hopes to shed light on how to leverage on those institutional-social-ecological attributes so that  more strategic economic policy  can be devised  by policymakers address  the crisis. The SES framework indeed acts as a common language among researchers, hence bridging boundaries of diff erent disciplines.  However, this research was primarily limited to literature reviews and secondary data analysis, subject to certain level of uncertainties, subjectivity and data inconsistency and unavailability. Future studies should focus on the inclusion  and further verification  of  the existing and  other SES attributes (higher-tier SES) to explain and predict the pandemic outcome, as well as the adaptation of the IAD-SES framework into other health-related topics."
