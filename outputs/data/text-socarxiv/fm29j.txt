Abstract
Limiting the spread of COVID-19 during the pandemic is a collective action
problem that calls on individuals to act, not just for their benefit but also
for the benefit of others in their community. Many environmental problems,
especially climate change, share this same characteristic. In this study, we use a
survey instrument to examine how pro-environmental attitudes and two types
of altruism relate to the tendency to follow social distancing guidelines and limit
voluntary social exposure during the pandemic. We find that pro-environmental
behaviors predict a feeling of moral obligation to reduce COVID-19 risk and
a lower level of voluntary social exposure. Voluntary, individual-level altruism
has no relationship with social exposure. These findings point to important
insights about the nuances in altruistic behavior. These insights may lead to
essential guidance for public health and environmental messaging that respects
and leverages the differences in voluntary, individual-level altruism and collective
altruism.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic is an extraordinary global event whose mitigation has
relied heavily on the will of individuals to act to protect the health of those around
them. This is especially true in the United States where tightly enforced top-down
1

mandates were largely delayed or avoided. Much of the public messaging around
COVID-19 risk management guidelines has tried to leverage values of altruism and
collectivism. Slogans or hashtags included “flatten the curve,” “stay home save lives,”
and “wear a mask. save a life.” Each of these calls on the individual to take an
action to help those around them. This call to place the greater good above one’s
own desires shares many common threads with environmental movements that call
on people to act to protect the environment even when they may incur a personal
cost.
The desire to act in a way that benefits others is called prosocial motivation.
There are four distinct forms of prosocial motivation based on the ultimate driver of
that motivation: egoism (seeking benefits for the self), altruism (seeking benefits
for another individual), collectivism (seeking benefits for a group), and principlism
(seeking to uphold a moral principle) (Batson, Ahmad, & Stocks, 2011). All four
of these forms of prosocial motivation could drive social distancing behavior during
the COVID-19 pandemic. One may make choices to avoid social contact because
they want to avoid getting themselves sick (i.e. egoism), hope to keep their family
members well (i.e. altruism), reduce the level of spread in their community (i.e.
collectivism), and adhere to the principle of the golden rule (i.e. principlism). In
this paper, we focus primarily on altruism as a potential driver of behavior, how
altruistic motivations may overlap with pro-environmental worldviews, and look for
new insights that may inform future work in both public health and environmental
spaces.
An extensive literature that seeks to understand the characteristics that are
common to those who hold pro-environmental attitudes has painted a fairly robust
portrait of the prototypical environmentalist. Some of those common characteristics
are potentially relevant for COVID-19 risk management behavior, specifically, selftranscendent values such as universalism (Schwartz, 1994), collectivism (Batson et
al., 2011), and altruism (Heberlein, 1972; Menges, Schroeder, & Traub, 2005; Popp,
2001; Stern, Kalof, Dietz, & Guagnano, 1995).
One of the early connections between pro-environmental behavior and altruism
relied on the logic that since environmental quality is a public good, contributing to
the public good required a degree of altruism (Heberlein, 1972). This concept was
further developed with the moral norm-activation theory of altruism (Schwartz, 1973,
1977). The norm-activation model states that individuals who believe that something
2

has harmful consequences for other people or other valued objects and that they
have the ability to prevent those harms, then they will feel a moral obligation to act
(Schwartz, 1973, 1977; Stern et al., 1995). This theory is particularly relevant for
individual choices in the COVID-19 pandemic, especially given the divergent beliefs
about the severity of risks (Morning Consult, 2020) and efficacy of risk management
practices (Gallup, 2021).
In addition to beliefs, values play a key role in driving decisions related to
environmental harm and COVID-19 pandemic risk. Schwartz and Bilsky define
values with the five key characteristics: “a) concepts or beliefs, (b) about desirable
end states or behaviors, (c) that transcend specific situations, (d) guide selection
or evaluation of behavior and events, and (e) are ordered by relative importance”
(1995, p. 551). The Schwartz Theory of Basic Values includes ten values that have
been found across many cultures: self-direction, stimulation, hedonism, achievement,
power, security, conformity, tradition, benevolence, and universalism (Schwartz, 1992,
2012; Schwartz & Sagiv, 1995). Benevolence and universalism are paired as defining
a higher-order value of “self-transendence” (Schwartz, 1992, 2012; Schwartz & Sagiv,
1995). Much of the early pro-environmental behavior literature uses the concept of
self-transcendence interchangeably with altruism without distinguishing between the
desire to help specific individuals and the desire to help the collective good or the
biosphere (Stern et al., 1995).
Value-Belief-Norm (VBN) Theory builds on Schwartz’s norm activation theory
and value theory, and links it to the New Environmental Paradigm (Dunlap, Van Liere,
Mertig, & Jones, 2000), a widely used measure of an environmentalist worldview,
to explain pro-environmental behavior (Stern, 2000; Stern, Dietz, Abel, Guagnano,
& Kalof, 1999). VBN theory also focuses on altruistic values as a precursor to
environmental behavior (Stern, 2000). As with norm activation theory, beliefs about
adverse consequences for valued objects (e.g., people or nature) and a sense of
self-efficacy to reduce those threats are key pieces in the causal chain between values
and action.
A separate literature on altruism has developed alongside the work on the relationship between self-transcendence and pro-environmental behavior. Interestingly, there
is very little overlap between the two literatures. In 1981, Rushton and coauthors
published the Self-Report Altruism (SRA) scale (Rushton, Chrisjohn, & Fekken,
1981). This scale has been widely used, including in recent work on COVID-19 (Head,
3

Kasting, Sturm, Hartsock, & Zimet, 2020; Kasting, Head, Hartsock, Sturm, & Zimet,
2020). The SRA scale focuses on helping behaviors like donating money or goods to
charity or lending a valuable item to a neighbor. In contrast to the self-transcendence
value cluster that is often referred to as altruism in the pro-environmental behavior
literature, it does not measure much that could be considered collectivism, except
for giving or volunteering for charities. Dietz, Fitzgerald, and Shwom (2005) is an
excellent overview of the literature of environmental values and clearly lays out the
development of the idea of altruism in the environmental values literature. However,
there is no mention of the Rushton self-report altruism scale.
Studies that look at both NEP and SRA are sparse and we found none that
directly report the relationship between these two scales (Bartczak, 2015; Randle,
Kemperman, & Dolnicar, 2019; Yuan & Bo, 2020). There are, however, a number
of studies that measure the relationship between pro-environmental measures and
SRA. A study of Japanese citizens found a significant positive relationship between
environmental awareness and altruism measured by the SRA scale (Aruga, 2020).
In a Chinese study, researchers found that higher levels of altruism, measured by
the SRA scale, led to less social discounting of environmental impacts (Guibing,
Xinwei, & Duo, 2017). Altruism, measured by the SRA, had a small positive
association with green purchasing behavior, but not green purchasing attitudes
(Yeoh & Paladino, 2013). Altruism had a positive relationship with reported proenvironmental behavior and willingness to pay to protect the environment (Naderi
& Strutton, 2015). In contrast, other studies have found no relationship between
altruism and pro-environmental behavior. In a study with young business school
students in Australia, altruism, measured by the SRA scale, had no relationship to
willingness to purchase an environmentally friendly mobile phone (Paladino & Ng,
2013). Also, a study of US consumers, altruism, measured by the SRA scale, had no
relationship to the importance of pro-environmentally certified wood (Thompson,
Anderson, Hansen, & Kahle, 2010).
In this study, we examine the relationships between pro-environmental attitudes,
altruism, and COVID-19 social distancing behavior. Using the results of an online
survey of over 600 people living in the United States, we explore whether people with
pro-environmental attitudes, measured by the New Environmental Paradigm (Dunlap
et al., 2000), exhibit a higher willingness to reduce social exposure during the COVID19 pandemic compared to those with less pro-environmental attitudes (H1). We also
4

examine whether people with higher levels of altruism, measured by the self-reported
altruism scale (Rushton et al., 1981), exhibit a higher willingness to reduce social
exposure (H2). Finally, we look at whether people with pro-environmental attitudes
have higher levels of altruism than those with lower levels of pro-environmental
attitudes (H3) and whether that altruism may drive social distancing behavior (H4).

Methods

2.1

Survey Methodology

Using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), we recruited 629 participants from October
21, 2020 to November 8, 2020. Amazon Mechanical Turks is an online workforce whose
participants have been identified as representative of the U.S. population (Paolacci,
Chandler, & Ipeirotis, 2010), and a good source of data relative to other traditional
data collection methods (M. Buhrmester, Kwang, & Gosling, 2011; M. D. Buhrmester,
Talaifar, & Gosling, 2018). We stratified the sample to draw evenly from four US
Census bureau regions (Northeast, Midwest, West, South). The survey instrument
was developed with Qualtrics, an online survey platform.
We removed participants who did not complete at least 75% of the survey, leaving
612 in the sample (97% of the sample). These remaining observations had a median
survey completion time of 23 minutes. To discard data from those who completed the
survey too quickly to have plausibly read the questions, those who spent less than
8.03 minutes on the survey were removed from the sample (5th percentile completion
time), leaving 581 observations. Basic demographic characteristics of the sample are
summarized in Table 1.
A number of questions focused on various risk factors for serious complications
from COVID-19 including age, age of household members, pre-existing conditions,
and health related financial factors. Participants ranged in age from 21 to 79, with
an average age of 38; only 3% of the sample was age 65 or older. However, 31% of the
sample reported living with at least one person who was 65 or older. While we did
not ask about specific conditions, 37% of the sample reported that they or another
member of their household had at least one of the pre-existing conditions that the
CDC has identified as placing them into at higher risk for serious complications from
COVID-19.1 Eighty-two percent of the sample reported having health insurance and
1

Including: chronic lung disease, moderate to severe asthma, serious heart conditions, compro-

5

83% reported having at least some paid sick leave (although a quarter of those had
less than one week).
The survey was conducted at the beginning of the winter peak of COVID-19
infections. Twenty-eight participants reported having tested positive for COVID-19
(4.6% of the sample). Fifty-seven percent of the sample reported knowing someone
who had tested positive.
Given that the survey was conducted in the weeks before and days just after the
2020 election, we asked about voting intentions in the presidential race. The sample
matched remarkably well with the general electorate with 48% planning to vote for
Biden/Harris and 43% for Trump/Pence.

2.2

State and Zip Code Based Data

Using participant reported zip codes, we used the zipcodeR R package to pull
population density data (Rozzi, 2020). The population density variable used in the
models is in thousands of residents per square mile at the zip code level.
We also utilize the number of daily recorded COVID-19 cases at the state level
from the CDC (for Disease Control & Prevention, 2020). We sum the number of
daily state-level cases for the week prior to the date that the participant took the
survey for the participant’s state of residence. Then we divide that case count by
the estimated 2019 population of the state to find the per capita number of cases for
the prior week (Bureau, 2019).

Survey Response Variables & Indices
Pro-Environmental Attitudes

We measure pro-environmental attitudes with the New Environmental Paradigm
(NEP), a widely used and validated fifteen question instrument (Dunlap et al., 2000).
We sum the eight NEP items and subtract the seven Dominant Social Paradigm
(DSP) items to generate a NEP value for each participant and standardize the score
to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
mised immune system, severe obesity (BMI > 40), diabetes, chronic kidney disease undergoing

Altruism

We use the Self-Reported Altruism (SRA) scale to measure altruism in our participants (Rushton et al., 1981). The scale is made up of twenty questions that
ask about different ways people have helped others without compensation such as
donating blood and helping a stranger (see Supplemental Materials). The scale has
been cited over 400 times since its publication in 1981. Participants answer whether
they have never, once, more than once, often, or very often performed each act.
These responses were coded to a numeric scale from 0 to 4 and those who chose “not
applicable” were coded as 0. The responses were summed and standardized.
2.3.3

Social Exposure Index

The social exposure index measures the extent of reported voluntary exposure to
people over the past week. We exclude relatively involuntary risk factors such as
household size, employment, working from home, etc.
The number of social contacts a person has outside of work and school is an
important determinant of COVID-19 risk (Jarvis et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). We
asked both how many people the participant had seen socially for more than five
minutes in the past 7 days, pi and the frequency of such social encounters, fi . In
addition to small social engagements, we asked a yes or no question about whether
the respondent had engaged in a variety of behaviors, ηij , that involved non-essential
contact with the community at large over the past seven days using a modified version
of questions from the USC Coronavirus Tracking Survey (University of Southern
California Center for Economic and Social Research, 2020). To test for internal
consistency among these behaviors, we estimated the Cronbach’s α. An acceptable
minimum threshold for internal consistency of a scale is 0.7 (Bland & Altman, 1997).
We include the following eight behaviors in the Social Exposure Index: going to a
bar, club, or other gathering place; indoor dining at a restaurant; visiting friends,
neighbors, or families’ houses; hosting friends, neighbors, or family at one’s house;
attending a party or event with more than ten people; attending a party or event
with more than fifty people; going to an indoor gym, yoga studio, or fitness center;
close contact (< 6ft) with non-household member (Cronbach’s α = 0.82). Following
the USC survey, we asked about the perceived risk level of a series of these activities
from extremely safe to extremely unsafe (University of Southern California Center

8

for Economic and Social Research, 2020). We converted these responses to a numeric
5-point scale with unsure as the middle value.
Indexed by individual i and COVID-19 risk-taking activity j, cij is the score
for the risk-taking behavior (‘c-score’), ηi is a binary variable for having recently
performed j, η¯j is the study population mean, σj is the population standard deviation.
γ¯j is the population mean of the perceived risk of a given activity on a 0 to 4 point
scale:
cij =

ηij − η̄
∗ γ¯j
σj

(1)

Thus, ci increases with more reported risk-taking behavior over the previous week
and risk-taking behaviors that are less common and perceived as more unsafe are
weighted more heavily than risk-taking behaviors that are common and perceived as
more safe.
To create the Social Exposure Index, Si , we combine the c-scores with standardized values of the number of social contacts, pi and frequency of social contacts, fi
and then standardize the sum. The Social Exposure Index for each individual is
given by:
χi =

X

cij +

pi − p̄ fi − f¯
+
σp
σf

(2)

Si =

χi − χ̄
σχ

(3)

j

Thus, Si has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 and is increasing with
higher levels of social exposure.
2.3.4

Additional Variables

We asked about whether the participant tested positive (5% of the study population)
or was diagnosed by a doctor as presumptive positive (additional 10% of the study
population). To understand how participants had experienced negative financial
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, following the survey questions of Niles et al.
(2020), we asked whether they had reduced income or hours, been furloughed, or lost
a job at any point during the pandemic and whether they were still experiencing
those losses today. We converted these into an ordered scale where losing one’s
job and remaining unemployed is the worst impact while having no changes to

9

one’s job situation is no impact. Then we standardized the 7-point scale to have a
mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Over half of the study population (295
participants) reported having lost their jobs at some point during the pandemic.
This oversampling of those who have experienced or are currently experiencing
unemployment is likely due to the fact that MTurk is a source of income that is
more likely to be utilized during periods of unemployment or underemployment.
For this reason, we control for these COVID-related financial impacts in a number
of our models. To better understand their financial risks of becoming ill, we ask
how many days of paid sick leave they would have available to them should they
contract COVID-19 and whether or not they have health insurance (University of
Southern California Center for Economic and Social Research, 2020). We also asked
about basic demographics, presidential voting intentions, a series of current mental
health questions (University of Southern California Center for Economic and Social
Research, 2020), perceived personal risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19
(University of Southern California Center for Economic and Social Research, 2020),
community social norms around masks and social distancing, views on vaccines
(University of Southern California Center for Economic and Social Research, 2020),
trust in medical scientists (Pew Research Center, 2019), and a multiple price lottery
designed to measure risk aversion (Holt & Laury, 2002).

2.4

Analytical Methods

To analyze the data and test our hypotheses, we employ a series of ordinary least
squares (OLS) regressions.
Indices and likert-scale variables are scaled to set the mean equal to zero and the
standard deviation equal to one. This allows for more meaningful interpretation of
model coefficients.
We use ordinary least squares regressions to evaluate the relationships among
variables. First we examine how the three measures of self-transcendence (NEP,
SRA, and MO) relate to demographic variables, voting preferences, risk preferences,
and regional variables:
N EPi = β0 + βX + γj Rj + i

(4)

where X represents a vector of demographic variables and voting preferences including
age (years), gender (male indicator variable), income, education, race (white indicator
10

variable), ethnicity (latino indicator variable), Trump-voter indicator variable, Bidenvoter indicator variable, risk preferences (higher values indicator more risk aversion),
and indicator variables for U.S. Census divisions. We repeat this model for SRA and
COVID-19 moral obligation:
SRAi = β0 + βX + γj Rj + i

(5)

M Oi = β0 + βX + γj Rj + i

(6)

Next using hierarchical multiple regression, we regress voluntary social exposure
on a series of covariates. In the first step, we use only the self-transcendence variable
(NEP, SRA, or MO). In the second step, we add demographic variables, voting and
risk preferences, and a mental health status index. In the third step, we include
a wide array of COVID-19 relevant variables such as household health and age
characteristics, subjective probabilities of infection and death, positive COVID-19
tests, estimated norms of mask-wearing and social exposure in one’s community,
number of recent cases in one’s state, health insurance and paid sick leave, trust in
medical scientists and vaccines, and concern about COVID-19.
To understand how whether the relationship between pro-environmental attitudes
and COVID-19 risk management behavior is driven by altruistic or self-transcendent
values, we use the following structural equation model (SEM) to test a mediation
model of direct and indirect effects between these variables (MacKinnon, Fairchild,
& Fritz, 2007):

Si = θ1 + cN EPi + 1i

(7)

Si = θ2 + c0 N EPi + bM Oi + 2i

(8)

M Oi = θ3 + aN EPi + 3i

(9)

where θ1 , θ2 , and θ3 are intercepts, Si is the dependent variable, M Oi is the mediating
variable, and N EPi is the predictor variable. From this model, we estimate the
direct effect of N EPi on Si as c’ and the indirect effect of N EPi on Si through the
mediating variable M Oi as ab. The indirect effect and direct effect sum to create
the total effect, c. Then we estimate the confidence intervals for these effects by
bootstrapping with 10,000 samples.

Results

We use OLS regression to examine how individual level and regional variables
correlate with pro-environmental attitudes, self-reported altruism, and COVID-19
moral obligation (Table 3). Compared to third party voters and non-voters, proenvironmental attitudes are less strong among Trump voters (p = 0.001), while
self-reported altruism is higher among Trump voters (p < 0.001). Biden voters
have stronger pro-environmental attitudes (p = 0.013) and and no strong difference
in levels of self-reported altruism (p = 0.068). A Wald test of coefficients shows
that Trump voters and Biden voters differ on both pro-environmental attitudes
(p < 0.001), self-reported altruism (p = 0.004), and COVID-19 moral obligation
(p < 0.001). Males score lower on pro-environmental attitudes than females and
other genders (p = 0.001) but do not differ on self-reported altruism (p = 0.769).
There are no major correlations between the dependent variables and race, but
those who identify as Latino report a stronger sense of moral obligation to protect
others from COVID-19 risk than do non-Latinos (p = 0.011). Higher levels of risk
aversion correlate with higher levels of pro-environmental attitudes (p < 0.001)
and lower levels of self-reported altruism (p < 0.001). Higher levels of education
correlate with higher self-reported altruism (p < 0.001) and has no relationship with
pro-environmental values (p = 0.147). There are some weak regional differences in
pro-environmental values and moral obligation, but compared to the East North
Central division, both New England and the Pacific divisions have higher levels of
self-reported altruism (p = 0.017 and p = 0.006 respectively).

H1: People with pro-environmental attitudes have a higher willingness to adhere
to COVID-19 risk reduction recommendations compared to those with less
pro-environmental attitudes.
We use a series of OLS regressions to examine the relationship between NEP
and voluntary social exposure (Table 5). There is a strong correlation between
pro-environmental attitudes and a willingness to reduce exposure to COVID-19 by
minimizing social interactions (Model 1, p < 0.001). This relationship persists after
controlling for a wide variety of variables (Models 2 and 3). The New Environmental
Paradigm (NEP) score alone explains 16% of the variation in social exposure over
the past week; one standard deviation increase in the NEP score corresponds to a
decrease in social exposure by 38.5% of a standard deviation.
Model 2 includes non-COVID-19 specific individual level variables – demographic
variables, voting intentions, risk aversion, and mental health status (Table 5). Including these covariates slightly decreases the relationship between the NEP score
and social exposure, but the relationship remains strong (p < 0.001). Education
correlates with higher levels of social exposure (p = 0.002). An experimental measure
of individual level risk aversion correlates strongly with decreased social exposure
(p < 0.001) where those who are more risk averse in a lottery game appear to be
more risk averse in COVID-19 exposure. A mental health index where higher values
correspond with increased mental distress has a strong positive relationship with
social exposure (p < 0.001). Trump voters exhibit higher levels of social exposure;
the intention to vote for Trump correlates with 49% of a standard deviation increase
in social exposure (p < 0.001).2 Age, gender, income, race, ethnicity, and intentions
to vote for Biden do not exhibit strong relationships with social exposure in this
model.
In Model 3, in addition to the variables in Model 2, a variety of COVID-19
relevant variables are included – household indicator variables regarding the presence
of seniors, young children, and individuals with pre-existing conditions; subjective
probabilities of contracting COVID-19 and, if contracted, dying from COVID-19;
indicator variables for those who have tested positive and those who know someone
who tested positive; population density in the respondent’s zip code; number of
2

Voting for a third party or not voting is the comparison group for the Biden and Trump indicator

variables.

new cases over the prior in the respondent’s state; indicator variables for those
who have paid sick leave and those who have health insurance; reported willingness
to get the COVID-19 vaccine (standardized); an index of anti-vaccination beliefs
(standardized), level of trust in medical scientists (standardized); and worry about
COVID-19 (standardized) (Table 5, Model 3). The magnitude of the relationship
between NEP score and social exposure is further reduced, but remains significant
(p = 0.007). The magnitude of the relationship between voting for Trump and
social exposure is also reduced, but remains significant (p = 0.011). Education, risk
aversion, and mental health are no longer significant, indicating a correlation with
additional included variables.
With the wide variety of COVID-19 relevant variables, some relationships emerged
that aligned with our expectations. Others were quite surprising. For example, having
already tested positive for COVID-19 is associated with increased social exposure
(p = 0.034). Either the tendency to engage in social settings during a pandemic
led to an increased likelihood of contracting COVID-19 or the positive test and the
antibodies that likely follow lead to people relaxing their social restrictions. The
number of new cases per capita in their state over the past week is associated with
a tendency to reduce social exposure (p = 0.002). However, knowing someone who
has tested positive for COVID-19 is also associated with increased social exposure
(p < 0.001). Based on the concept of the availability heuristic, we would expect that
knowing someone who contracted COVID-19 would lead one to believe that they may
be likely to get COVID-19, yet we see the opposite relationship in the data. Perhaps
if the COVID-19 case was mild, then it may have reduced their concern about the
disease, leading to more risky behavior. However, this relationship could arise from
social norms where people who are associating with others who are engaging in
risky behavior may also be more likely to engage in risky behavior. We see further
support for this explanation from the strong relationship between the estimation of
whether others in their community have reduced their social gatherings compared
to pre-pandemic levels with the tendency to increase one’s own COVID-19exposure
through optional social activities (p < 0.001).
Three household variables are included in model three. Having a person in one’s
household who has a pre-existing condition that, according to the CDC, makes
them more vulnerable to complications from COVID-19 does not affect their social
distancing behavior (p = 0.516). Having a person who is over the age of 65 in
17

one’s household is weakly associated with an increase in social exposure (p = 0.078).
And having small children in one’s household is associated with an increase in
social exposure (p < 0.001). This association may arise from the extremely difficult
childcare situation parents have found themselves in due to closures of schools and
daycare centers during the pandemic.
We asked participants to estimate their own probability, from 0% to 100%, of
contracting COVID-19 in the next three months and, if they contract it, what is their
estimated probability of dying from COVID-19 (University of Southern California
Center for Economic and Social Research, 2020). When controlling for all other
variables, the estimated likelihood of contracting COVID-19 has no relationship
with social distancing behavior (p = 0.778); the estimated likelihood of dying from
COVID-19 exhibits a weak positive relationship with social exposure (p = 0.097).
Participants who have experienced income loss due to the pandemic are more
likely to have higher levels of social exposure (p = 0.002). This could be due to
increased time available to socialize when one is not working or it could be a coping
mechanism either psychologically or logistically. However, interaction terms between
income loss and the mental health index are not statistically significant and neither
is an interaction term between the mental health index and the presence of small
children in one’s household.
We include three variables related to the trust of vaccines and medical science.
Interestingly, those who report being more likely to get the COVID-19 vaccine have
more voluntary social exposure (p = 0.004). This indicates that social exposure may
not be simply a result of rejecting the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic, but
rather a stronger desire to engage socially with one’s community making the risks
more worth the benefits of social engagement. People who score high on an antivaccination sentiment index are not more or less likely to social distance (p = 0.280).
But those who have a high level of trust of medical scientists are more likely to follow
the expert recommendations and limit social exposure (p = 0.025).
Finally, we examined whether the relationship between NEP and voluntary
social exposure would be moderated by political preferences. For Democrats, the
relationship between NEP and social distancing was strong (β = −0.400, p < 0.001)
with an R2 of 0.194. For Republicans, the relationship was weaker (β = −0.208, p =
0.053) with an R2 of 0.023. Thus, while the direction of the relationship held across
political affiliations, the NEP variable played a much smaller role in explaining the
18

variation in social distancing behavior for Republicans than for Democrats. However,
these two coefficients are not significantly different from one another at the 5% level
(p = 0.097). Similar patterns hold when looking only at Trump voters or Biden
voters.
After examining all of these different potential drivers of social distancing behavior,
we find that pro-environmental attitudes are strongly associated with a tendency
to limit social exposure. In the next model, we look to the role of altruism and
pro-social tendencies.
H2: Pro-environmental attitudes are driven, in part, by altruistic and pro-social
tendencies
The Self-Reported Altruism scale has a negative relationship with the New
Environmental Paradigm (p < 0.001). This does not support H2. However, the
belief that practicing social distancing is a moral obligation to protect others from
COVID-19 strongly correlates with the NEP (p < 0.001).3 The NEP also strongly
correlates with the worry that a family member will become seriously ill from COVID19 (p < 0.001).4 Hence, the results are mixed. It appears that people with strong
pro-environmental values show a high level of moral obligation to protect others from
COVID-19, but they are less likely to have carried out individual-level altruistic acts
unrelated to COVID-19.
H3: COVID-19 risk reducing behaviors are driven, in part, by altruistic and prosocial tendencies
In a single-variate linear regression, higher SRA scores correlate with higher
social exposure (β = 0.471, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.145),which is the opposite relationship
we expected. The relationship holds with non-COVID-19related control variables
included in the model (β = 0.273, p < 0.001), but the relationship is not associated
with all COVID-related variables included in the model (p = 0.526, Table 6, Model
5).

Feeling a moral obligation to practice COVID-19 precautions to protect those
around them has a negative relationship with social exposure in a single variate
regression but accounts for a very small proportion of the overall variation in social
exposure (β = −0.207, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.038). However, that relationship holds
when all other variables are included in the model (p = 0.050, Table 6, Model 5).
H4: The relationship between pro-environmental attitudes and COVID-19 risk
reduction is mediated by altruistic and pro-social tendencies.
NEP and MO are highly correlated (ρ = 0.44). However, a mediation model
using SEM does not show that the relationship between NEP and social exposure is
mediated by a belief in a moral obligation to protect others from COVID-19 (Figure
1).
We use a structural equation model with bootstrapped standard errors to analyze
the mediation effects. A one standard deviation increase in NEP corresponds to a
a = 0.338 (S.E. = 0.044) unit increase in the belief in a COVID-19 moral obligation,
where a unit corresponds to one standard deviation in the sample (p < 0.001).
Controlling for NEP, changes in moral obligation have no effect on social exposure
(b = −0.029, S.E. = 0.054, p = 0.591). There is no indirect effect of NEP on social
exposure through the moral obligation belief (ab = −0.011, S.E. = 0.021, p = 0.587).
However, we find that the mediation runs in the opposite direction: NEP mediates
the relationship between moral obligation and social exposure leaving no direct effect
of moral obligation on social exposure. A one standard deviation increase in the belief
in a moral obligation to protect others from COVID-19 corresponds to a a = 0.475
(S.E = 0.054) standard deviation increase in NEP (p < 0.001). Controlling for moral
obligation, an increase in NEP by one standard deviation corresponds to a change in
social exposure by b = −0.374 (S.E. = 0.043). Increases in a belief in a COVID-19
moral obligation were associated with decreases in social exposure indirectly through
increases in NEP. A bias-corrected bootstrapped confidence interval of the indirect
effect was below zero with a 95% confidence internal of [-0.244, -0.123]. Independent
of the association with NEP, COVID-19 moral obligation is not associated with
social exposure (c = −0.029, S.E. = 0.054, p = 0.591).

Discussion

In this study, people who have a more pro-environmental worldview, measured by the
NEP, have reported less voluntary social exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The drivers of that finding are, however, are less clear. We will first discuss our
initial hypotheses and then broaden our discussion to explore other potential drivers.
Contrary to our expectations, we also found a positive relationship between
altruism, measured by the SRA scale, and voluntary social exposure. This goes
against the hypothesis that people who are more inclined to help their neighbors
and acquaintances are also more willing to reduce their social activities to limit the
spread of COVID-19. However, when other variables related to pandemic beliefs,
concerns, trust in science, and community and household characteristics are included,
the relationship between altruism and social distancing disappears. Furthermore, the
SRA scale has been shown to correlate strongly with extroversion (Oda et al., 2014),
which could explain why those who scored higher on the SRA scale also were more
likely to engage in social contact despite the risks of COVID-19 infection. For both of
these reasons, we do not believe that altruism leads directly to more social exposure
as is indicated by the models without COVID-19 specific control variables (Table 6,
Model 1). Instead, it is likely that SRA simply correlates with other characteristics
that tend to increase voluntary social exposure during the pandemic.
A more direct question asking about the level of moral obligation that one feels
to take steps to protect other people from COVID-19 shows a strong relationship
with social distancing behavior. This question about the personal norm of social
distancing inherently contains the norm activation theory prerequisites. In order
to feel a moral obligation, one must believe that people around them are seriously
threatened by COVID-19 (adverse consequences) and that actions that one could
take would reduce that threat (ascription of responsibility). Given the widely varying
beliefs in the United States on both the seriousness of COVID-19 for those who
contract it and the effectiveness of recommended actions at reducing the spread of
the disease, for a subset of the sample population, this norm would not be personally
activated.
We hypothesized that the relationship between increased social distancing and
pro-environmental attitudes would be driven by a tendency for people with proenvironmental attitudes to be more altruistic than those with less pro-environmental

24

attitudes. This initial hypothesis is strongly supported by the literature when
altruism is taken to mean that they hold self-transcendent values. Yet, we find
the opposite relationship with self-reported altruism, a measure that focuses more
specifically on helping behaviors and not at all on universalist values. Much of
the literature connecting pro-environmental values to altruism uses universalism
and benevolence interchangeably with altruism without acknowledging the separate
literature on altruism as defined by Rushton (1981). Studies that focus on altruism as
universalism and benevolence elicit values that align strongly with a left-leaning world
view using terms that are widely rejected by right-leaning Americans, especially the
type of conservatism that has developed under the leadership of Donald Trump. For
example, in a simplified scale, the following three values comprise “altruistic values”:
“world at peace, free of war and conflict”; “Social justice, correcting injustice, care for
the weak”; and “Equality, equal justice for all” (Stern, Dietz, & Guagnano, 1998).
It appears that in this study, we are detecting the impacts of two different kinds
of altruism. The first is the kind of traditional acts of face-to-face altruism where one
person directly helps another. The second kind is a broader sense of moral obligation
to society (i.e., collectivism or universalism). Perhaps these two versions of altruism
are sometimes treated as substitutes. Culturally, the differences seem quite clear:
the self-reported altruism scale focuses on acts that align with the stereotypes of
small town America; it is a sort of good old-fashioned kindness.5 Conversely, a moral
obligation to protect others is a value that is sometimes rejected in conservative circles.
For example, a sign along a highway in Kansas that told drivers, “It’s your job to
keep others safe.” A number of locals were outraged (Thomas, 2020). They rejected
the idea that they were obligated to keep others safe even if they said that they work
to help others voluntarily. The difference in approach to altruism stems in part from
the choice to bestow a good act, known as autonomously motivated helping (Pavey,
Greitemeyer, & Sparks, 2012). To generalize, conservatives may value retaining
autonomy over altruistic acts and thus resist claims of moral obligations, especially
those coming from government policies or public servants. This insight might have
predicted the backlash over COVID-19 recommendations and requirements. Even
the terms that we use: “lockdown,” “mask mandate,” and “quarantine” all have
connotations of top-down authority that may have undercut a sense of autonomy
over altruistic acts of protecting one’s friends and family from COVID-19.
5

However, it is worth noting that the SRA had a positive relationship to population density.

25

Those with a pro-environmental worldview may be more predisposed to cooperate
with calls for collective action and less prone to backlash from calls to action by
community and political leaders that seek to activate the personal norm of a moral
obligation to protect people (or nature) around them. In fact, we find that a
pro-environmental worldview mediates the relationship between a feeling of moral
obligation to protect people around them from COVID-19 and social distancing
behavior.
There are other possible explanations as to why people with pro-environmental
attitudes may be more likely to social distance than those with less pro-environmental
attitudes. For example, in this study, we find that people who score high on the
NEP are also highly risk averse on the risk aversion spectrum as measured by Holt
and Laury’s (2002) multiple price lottery index (Table 3, Model 1). Risk aversion
may be a common driver of both pro-environmental attitudes and social distancing
behavior.
We also observed a very strong negative correlation between pro-environmental
attitudes and support for Donald Trump. Likely due to the strong influence Trump
had on how people viewed and responded to COVID-19 threats, Trump voters exhibit
far more voluntary social exposure than non-Trump voters. In fact, other than having
tested positive for COVID-19 already, reported intentions to vote for Trump for the
2020 election were the strongest predictors of social exposure in all of our models.
However, neither political affiliation nor voting intentions significantly moderated
the relationship between NEP and social distancing.
In future work, we will measure values directly to better understand the relationships among different types of altruism, pro-environmental attitudes, and COVID-19
risk management behavior.

Conclusions

Our study of voluntary social exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic revealed a
number of insights. First, people with pro-environmental attitudes had lower levels of
social exposure than people with less pro-environmental attitudes. We hypothesized
that altruism might be a common thread that drives both pro-environmental attitudes
and willingness to follow social distancing guidelines to reduce the spread of COVID19. We tested two different variables to understand the impact of altruism on

26

social distancing: the self-report altruism scale and a feeling of moral obligation to
protect others by social distancing. Self-reported altruism was not associated with
voluntary social exposure, but those who feel a moral obligation to protect others have
reduced their social exposure. Contrary to our expectations, the altruism score was
negatively correlated with pro-environmental attitudes. Thus a tendency to exhibit
individual level helping behaviors (person-to-person altruism) did not drive people
with pro-environmental attitudes to increase social distancing practices. Conversely,
the belief in a moral obligation to protect others from COVID-19 was positively
correlated with pro-environmental attitudes. A mediation analysis indicated that
the pro-environmental attitudes mediated the relationship between the belief in a
moral obligation to reduce others’ COVID-19 risks and social distancing behavior.
While more studies are needed to draw firm conclusions, this indicates that there
is a common driver of both pro-environmental attitudes and a moral obligation to
protect others from COVID-19. It may be the case that holding pro-environmental
attitudes predisposes one to take on additional moral obligations in collective action
problems.
As the public health community seeks to find ways to reach members of the
public and leverage an altruistic motivation to help those around us, it is critical
to recognize that for many people, there is a substantial difference between personto-person altruism and person-to-community altruism. If we try to connect to the
care that people have for those around them, then we need to know that appeals to
help the overall community or the general public may fail to resonate with people
whose altruistic values are motivated by the opportunity to help individual people
around them. Another possible driver of these findings is the role of autonomy in
altruism– many people are happy to help people around them if it is their choice
to do so but resent messages that imply they are obligated to help others. More
research is needed to understand specifically what kinds of messages are likely to be
effective depending on one’s underlying values. As we have seen during the COVID-19
pandemic, these questions have far reaching impacts for public health. Moreover,
as is shown by the relationship between pro-environmental values and feelings of
COVID-19 moral obligation, the need to understand how different types of altruistic
appeals may resonate for some and fall flat for others can also provide new and
much-needed insights to improve and broaden the effectiveness of pro-environmental
communication.

14. Humans will eventually learn enough about how nature works to be able to
control it
15. If things continue on their present course, we will soon experience a major
ecological catastrophe
