"12" "Abstract"
"13" "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic exposed  the inadequacy of  infectious disease surveillance throughout the US and other countries. Isolation and contact tracing to identify  all infected people  are key public health interventions necessary to control  infectious disease  outbreaks. However, these activities are dependent upon the surveillance platform  to identify infections quickly .  A  robust surveillance platform can  also  reinforce community adherence to behavioral interventions such as social distancing. In situations where contact tracing is feasible, all suspected cases and contacts of confirmed cases must be tested for a SARS-CoV-2 infection  and effectively isolated .  At the community level w astewater surveillance can identify areas where transmission is or is not occurring, and genetic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 can help to elucidate the intensity of transmission independent of the number of known cases and hospitalizations.  State and county public health departments should improve the infectious disease surveillance platform whilst the public is practicing social distancing.   These  enhanced surveillance activities  are necessary to contain the epidemic once the curve has been sufficiently flattened in highly burdened areas, and to  prevent escalation in areas where transmission is minimal."
"14" "Introduction"
"15" "Understanding where transmission of infectious disease  occurs  is a key  aspect of public health . With information about where infectious disease  transmission  is occurring, public health interventions can be targeted to the locations  and populations affected .  The information that  a robust infectious disease surveillance system  provides therefore  enables the control of infectious disease  transmission, even to the point of elimination  from geographic areas .   Despite global  awareness  and characterization of  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2   ( SARS-CoV-2 )  in early January 2020,  many countries’  surveillance  and subsequent public health interventions  were neither timely nor sufficiently coordinated to stay ahead of the pandemic curve.  Furthermore, o ur efforts to identify and characterize the virus and its disease have focused on symptomatic and even hospitalized cases.  Focusing on severe disease and hospitalizations   misses  the vast majority of transmission (an estimated 80% of transmission in Hubei Province). 1"
"16" "There is much that we do know about SARS-CoV-2.  The R 0   or average number of infections arising from a single infection  is around 3  (range of 1.4-6.5) , 2  with substantial pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. 3–8   Anyone can become very sick or even die from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but t hose most at risk  of  serious  illness or death  are the elderly and those with underlying health conditions such as  diabetes, chronic lung disease, and  heart disease. 9–13   The primary mode of transmission appears to be from close contacts via droplets, with perhaps some level of aerosol transmission. SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted when a person touches a contaminated surface - i nitial assessments suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is viable on wood or cloth  for  up to 2 days and on reflective surfaces (glass or steel) up to 4 days. 14   Several   investigational drugs and vaccines  are  being studied , but only non-pharmaceutical or behavioral interventions are currently available to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission."
"17" "Two  key piece s   of information  are  missing  in regards to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic . We do not know  who all of the people with a SARS-CoV-2 infection are  (who is transmitting SARS-CoV-2) , and we  do not  know  where the virus is  and is not  circulating  (where transmission is occurring) . We only know  who the people with known and confirmed COVID-19 test results are, and we only know  the locations where confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been found.  This lack of knowledge is a result both of the characteristics of the virus  ( i.e.,  pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission frequently occur) 3–8   as well as the  inadequacies  of our approach to SARS-CoV-2 surveillance  to date .  The  known cases of COVID-19  thus  only represent  a fraction of SARS-CoV-2 transmission . Should we continue in the current SARS-CoV-2  surveillance  paradigm, control of SARS-CoV-2 will be difficult if not impossible."
"18" "Surveillance  is  an intervention  to control and eventually eliminate transmission of SARS-CoV-2"
"19" "Surveillance is necessary for contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation"
"20" "Isolating people infected with SARS-CoV-2 until they are no longer infectious is the key to interrupting transmission.  Every  individual with  COVID-19 or infection of SARS-CoV-2 that is identified represents a potential chain of transmission, both forward and backward in time  (Figure  1 ) . Placing the person with a confirmed infection into isolation interrupts the chain of transmission going forward in time.  Tracing of all those who interacted with the infected person previous to their diagnosis (contact tracing)  is necessary to identify  links  in the chain of transmission going backward in time  that could potentially start different chains of transmission .  Current scientific understanding of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that key symptoms in COVID-19 (shortness of breath and fever) may appear up to 14 days after a person is infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, every contact  of the infected person  in the past 14 days must be identified and traced  in order to interrupt potential further transmission . Given the infectious nature of SARS-CoV-2 ,  failure to identify these links in the chain of transmission will mean failure to control transmission."
"21" "Figure  1 : Conceptual framework of chains of transmission for SARS-CoV-2 presuming an R 0  of 3-4. The incident case is diagnosed and isolated. Onward transmission to F 1A  to F 1C  and the subsequent transmission to the next generation of infections can be prevented by isolating the incident case  before transmission occurs . Transmission to F 1D  occurred before symptoms in the incident case. That infection must be identified through contact tracing to break the chain of transmission to the next generation of infections."
"22" "The feasibility of contact tracing and isolation  depends   up on the scale of the transmission within a community and the social network of the individual s with  infections. As transmission increases within a community,  conducting  these two key interventions can be overwhelming.  In areas   with  current low  transmission of SARS-CoV-2 , all infections and contacts  must be identified early for these key interventions to function.  In high transmission areas, social distancing makes contact tracing more feasible by both decreasing transmission but also through decreasing the number of contacts that need to be traced. And as transmission declines, these areas will benefit from a robust surveillance system  where potential links in the chain of transmission are identified early and acted upon immediately  in order to halt further transmission ."
"23" "Information from s urveillance improves voluntary behavioral interventions such as handwashing and social distancing"
"24" "The only  currents  methods of controlling SARS-CoV-2 are non-pharmaceutical , and a robust surveillance system with clear communication back to the public can improve the community’s participation in these behaviors .  The American population is inundated with messaging about the importance of  these  precautionary behaviors (e.g., social distancing,  hand washing , home cleaning, and wearing masks ) to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This messaging is likely to influence attitudes toward the effectiveness of precautionary behaviors. 15   Unfortunately, attitudes are often poor predictors of behavior, and people may believe that precautionary behaviors are effective, and still not engage in these  behaviors.  In other words  the relationship  between  public health messaging,  human attitudes ,  and behavior  is inconsistent . 16   More effective and frequently disseminated information , however  can  lead to more consistency between attitudes and behavior. 17–19   The more information an individual has with which to form an attitude, the greater the chances that they will act in concordance with these attitudes."
"25" "One mechanism through which we can understand the role of accurate information in behavior change is the Theory of Reasoned Action . 20  Fishbein &  Ajzen  suggest that decisions are a function of expectations about the consequences of performing a behavior. Individuals consider both the potential negative and positive outcomes of performing a behavior and weigh them against each other. In the case of precautionary behaviors, an individual would weigh the positive consequences of the behaviors (e.g., keeping themselves and others safe), with the negative consequences (e.g., disruption of regular activities through social distancing). Included in the evaluation would be an assessment of the relative likelihood of each consequence occurring. In the case of precautionary behaviors, the negative consequences are certain. For example, engaging the social distancing will disrupt regular activities. The positive consequences are less certain, as they hinge on knowledge of  SARS-CoV-2 transmission . If the individual  knows that  they  themselves  or others in the community are infected,  they may be more likely to be persuaded that  engaging in social distancing will have a positive consequence. Without  such  knowledge, there is less weight behind the positive consequence social distancing  and adherence to the behavior may dissipate ."
"26" "Threat  appraisal (i.e., perceived risk of vulnerability or susceptibility)  is   another  important factors in fluencing  the decision to engage in protective behaviors  such as social distancing  (Protection Motivation Theory) . 21,22   PMT suggests  that knowledge of  SARS-CoV-2 transmission and infection status  would contribute significantly to protective behaviors  and  solidify the certainty of threat.  Improved surveillance  for SARS-CoV-2 would not only provide infected individuals with more accurate information about their own risk, it would also provide the general public more accurate knowledge of the  transmission  of SARS-CoV-2 in their immediate community.  Numerous studies have shown that a wareness of disease prevalence in the community  affects risk assessment subsequently improving adherence to behavioral interventions such as social distancing . 23–26"
"27" "Accurate  information about infection status on  both the individual and community levels  will increase the likelihood of following recommended protocols  (social distancing and hand washing) . This is particularly relevant for individuals in areas where  numbers of  known   COVID-19  cases are low.  The false impression given by  low numbers  that exclude the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission  give individuals a false sense of low risk,  which could result in less compliance with  precautionary behavior  and accelerate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 transmission ."
"28" "Properties of SARS-CoV-2 that make enhanced surveillance necessary"
"29" "Three aspects of infectious disease need to be considered when designing a surveillance platform capable of  guiding  the control and interruption of  infectious disease  transmission: 1) the speed with which the pathogen spreads through populations, 2)  the  ability of the pathogen to spread in the absence of symptoms, and 3) the timing and level of illness caused by the pathogen."
"30" "As mentioned earlier, t he speed at which an infectious disease spreads through populations is measured using the basic reproductive number (R 0  or R-naught). This is a theoretical value that describes the number of secondary cases expected to be caused by a single infected individual. The R 0  provides a general description of how fast an epidemic will grow, the bigger the R 0 , the faster the epidemic will grow. The R 0  is a function of both the pathogen, but also the setting.  Such factors as  crowding, underlying health status,  age of the individuals in the community,  level of social mixing, and cultural behaviors all affect the R 0 . Current estimates place the R 0  for SARS-CoV-2 at somewhere between 2 and 4, ranging from 1.4 to 6.49. 2  With an average of approximately 3, the R 0  is higher than influenza, a little higher than SARS-CoV-1, and just about the same as Small Pox. 27"
"31" "Second, the ability of the pathogen to spread in the absence of symptoms can be estimated using a few different measures.  One such measure, the  he generation interval is the time  between  onset of infection in  person one (i.e. the “infector”) to the  onset of infection in  person two (i.e. the “ infectee ”) . This  lag time is not  easily  measured , so  instead  we often use the time from symptom onset in the infector to symptom onset in the  infectee . Estimates for the generation interval are between 3.95 and 5.2 days . 28,29  Another important parameter is the infectious period, or the time when a person can transmit an infection.  As described earlier, a  person can be infectious while they are pre-symptomatic ( ie : the symptoms have not started yet) or during an asymptomatic infection ( ie : they never  feel any  symptoms). Due to the novelty of the virus and limited testing capacity, the infectious period is not yet known for SARS-CoV-2.  V irus can be found in sputum and stool of infected patients for an average of 20 days, up to 37 days  after the end of symptoms . 30  Another study found that pre-symptomatic transmission was common, occurring in 48-62% of cases . 28"
"32" "Next  we consider the timing and level of illness caused by the pathogen . Most testing strategies globally have focused on testing the most severe patients, missing the mild and asymptomatic cases.  This failure to test the less severe cases misses up to 80% of transmission . 1   Initial reports suggest that o nly about 20% of patients will experience severe disease  and  anywhere from 18-40% of all SARS-CoV-2 infections are likely to be asymptomatic . 8,32"
"33" "Improving the surveillance platform for SARS-CoV-2"
"34" "We can improve the surveillance platform for SARS-CoV-2 with three distinct needs in mind: 1) the need to isolate infections in order to prevent onward transmission, 2) the need to improve participation in non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing when transmission is occurring within a community in order to decrease the amount of transmission, and 3) the need to identify areas where transmission is not occurring in order to safely engage in society. The current surveillance paradigm for SARS-CoV-2 does not produce data to adequately address these needs. We therefore propose  three  improvements to the SARS-CoV-2  surveillance  platform."
"35" "Expand contact tracing to all suspected cases of coronavirus   and test all contacts regardless of symptoms"
"36" "Contact tracing is the fundamental method to control outbreaks of infectious disease. It involves finding people with infections and then identifying others who have had contact with those people and testing them for infections. In this manner, not only is the forward chain of transmission interrupted from the identified index case but also any forward chains of transmission can  potentially  be interrupted from contacts (Figure  1 ). Contact tracing has been fundamental for the control of recent infectious disease outbreaks such as ebola, 33  helped to contain the first SARS epidemic in 2003 and the MERS outbreaks since 2012, and has been crucial to some countries’ approaches to containing SARS-CoV-2. 34"
"37" "The majority of  people with  COVID-19 illness  only develop  mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization. 35  These individuals typically convalesce at home. Although not requiring hospitalization, contact tracing and isolation must be conducted with these individuals in order to break chains of transmission. Furthermore, i ndividuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 are infectious before they have symptoms, 4  and a significant proportion of them will not develop symptoms. 7,36  These pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic cases are likely an important piece of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Without controlling the source of infection, which in  most  case s   of  SARS-CoV-2  is  an asymptomatic ,  pre-symptomatic , or mildly symptomatic  individual, transmission continues and the contact tracing efforts  fail  to control the outbreak . 37"
"38" "Although SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and in the absence of intervention contact tracing alone may be insufficient to interrupt transmission, 38  initial efforts to contain or slow SARS-CoV-2 transmission  in the US  and other countries  failed for  two  primary reasons , both underlined by the massive shortage and delays in diagnostic tests .  Initially, o nly  individuals fitting a strict case definition that included travel to a location with known transmission were tested for a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Once SARS-CoV-2 transmission was established in the US (likely late January or early February) this case definition missed the majority of infections  even though early cases were identified as community  transmitted .  As  it became  clearer  that SARS-CoV-2 transmission was established in the US the strict testing criteria  was expanded , but still excluded individuals  with mild symptoms or asymptomatic contacts . These approaches may have missed 80% of actual SARS-CoV-2 transmission. 1"
"39" "In order to contain outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2  infections must be isolated.  Given the substantial amount of pre-symptomatic transmission and asymptomatic  infections, there are already challenges in identifying all infections. Any inefficiencies in testing either diagnosing incident cases or during contact tracing reduce the efficiency of finding infections (Figure 2) .  In the absence of sufficient diagnostic capacity, only quarantine of all contacts would effectively isolate all the SARS-CoV-2 infections and interrupt the chains of transmission from the asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases.   Broadly shutting down certain aspects of community and businesses  are  an attempt to slow SARS-CoV-2 transmission . With better surveillance data  the community sheltering in place and closure of businesses can be more targeted and effective. Enhanced surveillance can also identify when it would be safe to gradually open businesses and allow the public to conduct more of their outside activities ."
"40" "Figure 2: Leakages in the surveillance system that can lead to missing SARS-CoV-2 infections and failing to control transmission. 1) There is a substantial amount of pre-symptomatic transmission that occurs before diagnosis of an incident case. This transmission must be contained through contact tracing. 2) A substantial percentage of cases are asymptomatic, and never seek treatment.  As it is not likely that entire chains or transmission are asymptomatic t hese infections are found through robust contact tracing where everyone is tested regardless of symptoms.  3) Inadequate testing is the most dangerous leakage in the surveillance system  – only testing symptomatic and hospitalized cases may miss up to 80% of transmission . 1  When all suspected infections are tested, then no leakages are observed here."
"41" "Institute wastewater coronavirus surveillance to determine presence or absence of community transmission in municipalities"
"42" "Human waste contains a wealth of information about diets and environmental exposures. When measured at waste treatment facilities, the contents of human waste provide a representative sample of the diets and environmental exposures of the population served by that waste treatment facilities. The information can then be used to classify communities as exposed or not. This process in epidemiology is termed environmental surveillance and forms a key pillar to monitoring polio transmission. 39  The primary symptom of polio that forms the case definition is acute flaccid paralysis; this only occurs in 0.5% of polio cases.  Thus ,  polio transmission can occur within a community without any cases being identified by a surveillance system relying on cases in the health system.  Environmental surveillance enhances identification of the presence of polio transmission in communities regardless of whether or not there are acute flaccid paralysis cases in that community. 40  Due to the rarity of acute flaccid paralysis, environmental surveillance can even detect an outbreak of polio before or without any paralysis cases. 41"
"43" "Environmental surveillance has also been utilized to identify the circulation of  other  numerous toxins and pathogens in populations. In terms of viruses, environmental surveillance has demonstrated transmission for a host of pathogens including: hepatitis E, 42  hepatitis A, 43  human bocavirus, 44   saffold  virus (an emerging cardiac virus), 45  norovirus, 46  and rotavirus. 46  Environmental surveillance has also been proposed as a method of monitoring antimicrobial resistance, 47  and been utilized to monitor the use of illicit drugs. 48"
"44" "A recent breakthrough in Holland showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the sewage system weeks before the first confirmed COVID-19 case was confirmed in the health system , 49  and a team in Boston showed an abundance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the wastewater there. 50  Two factors about the novel coronavirus provide further evidence that environmental surveillance will identify communities in which transmission is occurring. First, coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 are shed in human stool. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool from a child with an asymptomatic infection, 51  and has been found in high concentrations in the toilet bowl of hospital patients’ bathrooms. 52  Further, during the SARS epidemic of 2003 (SARS-CoV-1) the virus was excreted in human stool for a median of 27 days in a cohort of patients,  53  and was thought to be, at least in part, transmitted by fecal contamination. 54  A team demonstrated that SARS-CoV-1 RNA could be detected in sewage from hospitals. 55,56   Other  viruses of the  Coronaviridae  family have been shown to survive in water and sewage for days to weeks. 57  Second, SARS-CoV-2 RNA is able to persist for an extended period of time in the environment. SARS-CoV-2 survivability in the environment appears to be similar to the survivability of SARS-CoV-1, 58  and other viruses of the  Coronaviridae  survive for extended periods of time on surfaces, up to 28 days. 59  More important than survivability, however, is the ability of the RNA to persist and be detected. From the  Diamond Princess cruise ship SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified up to 17 days after infected patients vacated their rooms. 60"
"45" "Successful  environmental surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 will generate two critical pieces of information.  Depending  upon the limits of detection , the surveillance will  documents  the presence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission irrespective of challenges with treatment seeking behavior or diagnostic testing.  The information provided is much finer detail  than what can be collected through diagnosing treatment seeking individuals  (Figure 3).  Furthermore, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from environmental surveillance can occur before the health system surveillance detects a COVID-19 case. 49   Environmental  surveillance when coupled with a robust health system surveillance can give confidence to the suggestion that SARS-CoV-2 transmission is absent in a community.  While environmental surveillance determines viral prevalence in aggregate and is not useful for identifying infected individuals, it can be useful for ranking tested service areas by degree of concern, especially when combined with information on the degree of compliance with social-distancing guidelines, travel, average age, or access to healthcare. Such rankings would allow proper timing of the allocation of scarce resources, implementation of more strict guidelines to affected area, or other targeted public health strategies."
"46" "Although attempts have been made to link viral concentration in wastewater to the number of cases in the tested service area, 50  there are a number of  limitations with this approach . Viral particles are diluted, degraded, and deposited to an unknown degree between shedding and detection. And as mentioned previously, spotty testing of individuals likely leads to dramatic underestimates of infected individuals in an area.  Further, approximately 25% of the US population relies on onsite or clustered wastewater treatment systems instead of centralized wastewater treatment plants for wastewater disposal, limiting surveillance at  wastewater treatment plants to connected communties . 61   Therefore, direct quantitative comparison of viral concentrations between different service areas or to case counts are probably not reliable at this time. Rather, it appears the most useful quantitative inferences to be drawn from environmental surveillance would be changes in viral load within a service area over time. It is then reasonable to think that these rates of growth or decline may then be used to inform wastewater catchment-specific public health strategies."
"47" "Figure 3: Environmental surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 can potentially measure the presence of transmission at the level of the wastewater treatment plant, providing much more detailed information than the location of a known confirmed COVID-19 case. Number of known COVID-19 cases as of April 8, 2020  in New York state, USA . 31"
"48" "Institute genetic surveillance of the virus to assess level of transmission in communities"
"49" "Pathogens responsible for infectious disease replicate much more quickly  and do not have as many built-in genetic proofreading systems compared to  larger organisms,  such as human beings. Therefore,  genetic mutations  occur frequently . The vast majority of these mutations do not affect the functionality of the pathogen. But the mutations do provide clues into transmission via the genetic relationship between viruses isolated in different people and from different locations.  For example, when two patients have genetically identical viruses, they were likely in the same transmission chain. If two patients have genetically different viruses, they were likely infected from different transmission chains. 27  We can then expand this principle to populations.  When the genetic diversity of a pathogen is low in a given area or across time, we can infer that transmission is also low in that area  as there are only a few transmission chains. However, w hen the genetic diversity of a pathogen is high in a given area, we can infer that transmission is also high in that area  as there are likely multiple transmission chains ."
"50" "Virus genetics have been utilized to describe the geographic scope of emerging infectious disease for decades. In the 1990’s viral genetics were able to determine the source of various measles outbreaks and confirm that these were imported cases and subsequent outbreaks rather than community spread. 62   Researchers have been using these techniques to track the spread and transmission dynamics of influenza,  Middle Eastern Respiratory Virus (a different coronavirus), Ebola, and Zika, among others. 63–65  SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that uses an RNA dependent replication strategy. 66  Therefore, virus replication is highly error prone, resulting in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The majority of these SNPs will not affect the virus function but can be used to track virus evolution and transmission. 67"
"51" "Coupled with the number of cases of COVID-19 in an area, the genetic diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 found can be used to make inferences on the  intensity of transmission in a community . For example, in Washington state two COVID-19 cases were confirmed to be genetically identical despite being one month apart and having no traceable chain of transmission through contacts. At the time (February, 2020) it was thought that the majority of COVID-19 cases were being imported from travelers. Genetic analysis of these two isolated viruses showed that there were unknown chains of transmission from the first imported COVID-19 case into Washington and appropriate public health measures were employed. 68  On a global scale, researchers are already using genetic diversity to track the spread of SARS-CoV-2. 69"
"52" "Conclusion"
"53" "The control of SARS-CoV-2 requires intense surveillance. The key control measures (contact tracing and isolation) are impossible without knowledge of who has an infection and where transmission is occurring. Investing in surveillance platforms now, through expansion of environmental and genetic surveillance, will help build understanding of where transmission is occurring and at what intensity. The capacity for contact tracing is highly dependent on the number of  incident  COVID-19 cases that are identified. Throughout larger metropolitan areas in the US, the pandemic is in full force and contact tracing will be impossible until the number of cases declines. Should social distancing be effective, however, transmission will decline and allow for contact tracing to be recommenced. In more rural  areas  with fewer cases, enhanced contact tracing must be prioritized to prevent an escalation in transmission."
