A Guilt-Free Strategy to Increase Self-Reported Non-Compliance with COVID-19 Preventive
Measures: Experimental Evidence from 12 Countries

Abstract
Studies of citizens’ compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures routinely rely on
survey data. While essential, public health restrictions provide clear signals of what is
socially desirable in this context, creating a potential source of response bias in self-reported
measures of compliance. In this research, we examine whether the results of a guilt-free
strategy that was used by Daoust et al. (2020) to loosen this constraint are generalizable
across twelve countries, and whether the treatment effect varies across subgroups. Our
findings show that the guilt-free strategy is a very useful tool in every country included,
increasing respondents’ proclivity to report non-compliance by 9 to 16 percentage points.
This effect holds for different subgroups based on gender, age and education. We conclude
that the inclusion of this strategy should be the new standard for survey research that aims
to provide crucial data on the current pandemic.

In the fight against the spread of the COVID-19 virus, research that aims to explain compliance
with public health preventive measures is of utmost importance. The severity of virus activity is,
in no small part, a function of citizens’ behaviours (Chan et al. 2020; Haushofer & Metcalf 2020).
Therefore, much research has focused on understanding who complies, and what are the sociodemographic and attitudinal correlates of (non)compliance. Answering these questions is critical,
pushing governments and public health agencies to gather reliable data on compliance with
preventive measures (e.g. social distancing, the use of face masks, etc.). A great deal of this data
comes from survey research.

The need for high quality data on compliance with public health measures has led some researchers
to investigate the reliability of survey data more closely. In particular, some studies have examined
the possibility that public health restrictions in the pandemic context have created common social
norms for behaviours that are valued (e.g. social distancing). In turn, these norms create an
incentive for respondents to under-report behaviours that are proscribed (e.g. social gatherings).
The resulting social desirability bias can considerably affect the quality of data used by policymakers and public health officials in their decision-making, which is problematic. Both Larsen et
al. (2020) and Munzert and Selb (2020) considered the possibility that citizens’ reported
compliance with public health measures was affected by social desirability bias. These two singlecountry studies relied on a list experiment approach (also called unmatched item count technique).
Reassuringly, they failed to detect social desirability in the self-reported behaviour of Danish
(Larsen et al. 2020) and German (Munzert and Selb 2020) citizens. Findings from these list
experiments, however, stand in contrast to the results of a recent study by Daoust et al. (2020),
which tested different “face-saving” (or guilt-free) strategies designed to loosen the social norm

3

of compliance with public health measures in the context of three surveys conducted in Canada.
The goal was to reduce social desirability in respondents' answers.

When exposed to a short preamble (referring to the fact that some people have altered their
behaviours since the beginning of the pandemic, while others have continued to pursue various
activities) combined with guilt-free answer choices (including “only when necessary”),
respondents in the Daoust et al. (2020) study were substantially more likely than respondents from
the control group to report non-compliant behaviour in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
This suggests that there is a social desirability bias in citizens' self-reported behaviour when no
guilt-free option is provided. While promising, these results are based on a single country, i.e.
Canada. We do not know how effective the strategy is beyond the Canadian case. The question of
generalizability is particularly important given that the list experimental approaches used in
Denmark and Germany showed no signs of social desirability (Larsen et al. 2020; Munzert and
Selb 2020).

In this research, we extend the most effective face-saving strategy identified by Daoust et al. (2020)
to twelve countries. Doing so, we examine whether results are generalizable beyond Canada and
across different contexts. In addition, we test whether the impact of the face-saving (guilt-free)
answer option is homogenous across different subsets of the population to assess potential
differentiated effects conditional on individual characteristics (Barari et al. 2020; Brouard et al.
2020). To preview our results, we show that the guilt-free strategy is a very useful tool in every
country examined, increasing respondents’ proclivity to report non-compliance by 9 to 16
percentage points. This effect holds for different subgroups based on gender, age and education.

We conclude that this method should become the new standard for survey research of citizens’
compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures, ultimately providing higher-quality data to
governments and public health agencies.

Measuring citizens’ compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures
Social desirability bias has been a problem in survey research well before the COVID-19 pandemic
and researchers have addressed the issue in several ways. Some work suggests that survey mode
is an important factor, as the presence of a live interviewer can create greater incentives for
respondents to provide more socially desirable answers. A meta-analysis on the topic suggests that
an online mode is the best way to allow people to report undesirable behaviour (Gnambs and
Kaspar 2014). But even with online surveys (e.g. without a live interviewer), there can still be
social desirability bias. Survey researchers are therefore interested in developing additional ways
and methodological tools to reduce social desirability and obtain more accurate estimates of
undesirable behaviour (see for example Becher et al. 2020).

Focusing on the current pandemic context, some of the first experimental studies of measurement
strategies to reduce social desirability bias found limited evidence of social desirability bias when
employing the list experimental technique (Larsen et al. 2020; Munzert and Selb 2020). Munzert
and Selb (2020) report a difference in the prevalence of not following social distancing between
the treated and untreated group of 6 percentage points that is "barely significant at conventional
levels due to the vast measurement error of the list estimate." (p. 206) They also find that the
prevalence of the undesirable behavior is higher when using a multivalue response option
compared to either a simple yes-no question or the list experimental estimate. This shows that

5

dichotomous direct questions should not be taken at face value. Discussing these findings, Munzert
and Selb (2020) suggest that face-saving strategies might be a "valuable alternative" (p. 207). In
this research, we test this face-saving strategy using a comparative experimental design and our
results strengthen this conclusion.

The objective of the face-saving strategy is to reduce social desirability in respondents' answers
by adding a (short) preamble and one or more guilt-free answering options. These steps should
loosen the norm around a desirable response and make it more acceptable for respondents to admit
non-compliance with the desirable outcome. Such an approach has been applied to a wide range
of topics. For example, political scientists used it to study voter turnout (Belli et al. 2006; MorinChassé et al. 2017) where there is a clear norm that voting is the right thing to do. It has also proven
to be useful to study illicit behavior like shoplifting (Holtgraves et al. 1997), sexual/health
behaviour such as using a condom during sexual intercourse (Catania et al. 1996; Raghubir and
Menon 1996), or consumer choice in market research (Nancarrow et al. 2001).

In the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic where it is crucial to understand citizens’ level
of compliance with preventive measures, Daoust et al. (2020) applied the face-saving strategy to
analyze a potential social desirability bias. This latter work showed that face-saving strategies can
increase the proportion of citizens who self-report non-compliance with a range of public health
preventive measures in Canada. They argue that this increase in self-reported non-compliance is a
consequence of reduced social desirability. While there is no objective benchmark to compare
these estimates, they substantiate this claim by showing that a similar increase in self-reported

6

non-compliance is not observed when the same face-saving strategy is applied to a series of
placebo behaviours that are not prohibited (e.g., grocery shopping).

While promising, the results from Daoust et al. (2020) suffer from a key limitation: Their focus on
a single context, that is, the Canadian case in April 2020. In this paper, we address this issue by
implementing the authors’ approach in twelve different countries. By doing so, we can ascertain
whether results are specific to a single context and time period, or whether the effectiveness of a
face-saving answer option to reduce social desirability in self-reported compliance with public
health measures applies more generally. In the next section, we detail our data and how we
implemented the face-saving strategy.

Data and Indicators
We ran a face-saving (or guilt-free) experiment in twelve countries: Australia, Austria, Brazil,
France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Poland, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United
States. We have obtained the written consent from participants who answered the survey. The data
were analyzed anonymously. The project "Citizens' Attitudes Under COVID-19 Pandemic" has
received the ethical certificate from Science Po Paris (France). The online surveys were conducted
by three different data collection firms: IPSOS (for all countries except Australia, United States
and Spain), CSA (for Australia and the United States) and Netquest (Spain). While it does not
entail major differences, having different firms involved in data collection reduces the risk of bias
due to potential “house effects.” Data collection mainly occurred in mid- June 2020 within a period
of a few days (maximum five), producing a nationally representative sample of about 1,000

7

respondents in most of the countries.1 Countries included in the study experienced different levels
of infection and death rates (Bosancianu et al. 2020) ranging from a low in Australia and NewZealand (with less than .5 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants) to a high experienced in the United
Kingdom (with more than 59 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants). Although the countries in our sample
were similarly influenced by public health guidelines established by global health authorities, the
timing, stringency and components of public health measures adopted to combat the pandemic
also strongly varied from Sweden (the least stringent) to New Zealand (the most stringent).
Moreover, the countries in our sample also reflect different levels of politicization, with relatively
more politicization of the pandemic response in Brazil and the USA than in other countries. Table
A.1 of the Supplementary Material lists the exact dates of data collection in each country, as well
as the number of observations. Moreover, Table A.2 shows the population per country and the
death rates (per 100 000 inhabitants) as of June 15th and Table A.3. provides an overview of the
preventive measures that were recommended and compulsory in each country.

Here, we make use of the most effective face-saving strategy identified by Daoust et al. (2020),
which is also the strategy they recommend for future work (their Study 3). Extending this work to
other countries, half of each national sample was randomly allocated a direct question while the
other half received the face-saving treatment. The direct question was: “Have you done any of the
following activities in the last week?” followed by a set of four items and yes/no answer choices.2
The face-saving question preamble was:
“Some people have altered their behaviour since the beginning of the pandemic, while
others have continued to pursue various activities. Some may also want to change their

behaviour but cannot do so for different reasons. Have you done any of the following
activities in the last week?”
Respondents in the treatment group received the answer options yes/occasionally/only when
necessary/no. The first three answer choices indicated (and were coded as) non-compliance with
the items. Of these three options, ‘occasionally’ and ‘only when necessary’ were the guilt-free
answer choices. The four items, displayed in a random order, were:
•
•
•
•

Go shopping or take public transportation without a face mask or taking it off during it
Meet friends, family or colleagues greeting them by shaking hands, hugging or kissing
Have a group of friends or family over at your place
Participate in social activities (work, sport, religious ceremony…) without respecting
physical distancing

These items refer to behaviours that are known to be crucial to minimize the spread of the disease
among the population, that is, wearing a face mask and different forms of social distancing (Chu
et al. 2020; Courtemanche et al. 2020). Moreover, greeting people by shaking hands, hugging or
kissing was clearly not recommended, while hosting a gathering at one’s place was allowed though
not without some level of risk (e.g., Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2020, see the
“Hosting gatherings or cook-outs” section).

In a second step, we explore whether the effects of the treatments are heterogeneous. We consider
respondents' gender (female or male), age (treated as linear, from 18 to 91), and their level of
education. Education was measured using different categories in each country given their different
educational systems. We use a 0 to 1 “university graduate” scale in order to consistently model the
effect of having obtained a university education in each country. We also provide individual
analyses for each country. For descriptive statistics on how much these preventive measures were

9

respected in the twelve countries, see Figure B.1 of the Supplementary Material.3 Descriptive
statistics for gender, age and education, are reported in Appendix B of the Supplementary Material.

Results
Our main goal is to ascertain whether providing a short preamble and guilt-free answer options
increases citizens' likelihood of reporting non-compliance with important public health measures
like mask-wearing and social distancing. To shed light on this question, we analyze the data
discretely across the four items as well as across the twelve countries. We thus provide a complete
picture of the experimental effects and avoid pooling to ensure that the results are not driven by
certain items or countries. Figure 1 displays the proportion of non-compliers with the preventive
measures for the control (direct question) and the treatment (face-saving) groups. The treatment
group is depicted in grey, while the black bars indicate levels of reported compliance in the control
condition. With four items in twelve countries, Figure 1 plots a total of 48 effects of interest.

Figure B.2 in the appendix distinguishes between the two guilt-free answer choices (“Occasionaly” and “Only
when necessary”), showing that there are no substantial differences between them with the only two exceptions
being Brazil and Spain, where non-compliers tend to prefer the “only when necessary” answer choice.

Guilty-free treatment

Note: Means of non-compliance are shown with 95% confidence intervals included. ATE=Average treatment effect.

As clear from eyeballing the graphs, the means of non-compliance are systematically higher in the
face-saving group (the grey bars). More precisely, the impact of the treatment is positive in 47 out
of 48 cases (the single exception being Austria for the face mask item). Substantially speaking, the
average treatment effect (averaged across all countries) of receiving the treatment ranges from 9
(the face mask) to 16 percentage points (hosting at home). Greeting people with non-recommended
behaviours and not respecting physical distancing show an ATE of 12 and 14 percentage points,
respectively. While we prefer to focus on the substantive effect, we note that in most cases (45 out
of 47 positive effects), the differences are significant at p<.05 (based on two-sided t-test).
Moreover, we implemented the Romano-Wolf correction given the number of tests that we
presented (Clarke et al. 2020; Romano & Wolf 2007). Tables D.2-5 show that the differences
11

between the treatment and the control group are systematically different (that is, in 45 cases) even
using Romano-Wolf p-values.

Does the impact of the face-saving treatment differ across various subgroups of the population? In
an exploratory fashion, we look at the potential moderation effect from gender, age and education,
which are known to be linked to compliance with preventive measures (Barari et al. 2020; Brouard
et al. 2020; Galasso et al. 2020). For this analysis, we rely on a pooled dataset that includes the
information from all countries. Figure 2 shows the coefficients from logistic regressions for
different groups. The full regression outputs can be found in Table C.1-3 of Appendix C. The
results for potential heterogenous effects across subgroups based on gender, age and education are
quite clear: Based on the evidence, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no moderation effect.
The interaction coefficients never reach statistical significance at p<.05. The direction of the
effects is perfectly split for gender, three out of four coefficients are negative for age and three are
positive for education.

Note: The values of the interaction coefficients estimated in Tables C.1-3 of the Supplementary Material are shown,
with 95% confidence intervals included.

All in all, we find that the face-saving strategy is effective. In total, 47 out of 48 effects are positive,
and, their effects are substantive, ranging from 9 to 16 percentage points. Moreover, the impact of
the treatment effect is fairly homogenous. As shown in Figure 2, it does not seem to be conditioned
by peoples’ gender, age or level of education.

We made sure that our conclusions were robust in several ways. First, although we should be
cautious about randomization checks in an experimental context (Mutz et al. 2019), we verified
that both control and treatment groups were similar in terms of age, gender and education. The
average age was identical at 47 (control v/s treatment); 52% of people in the control group were
women compared to 51% in the treatment group, and means for education were the same at .60.

13

Second, using weights for age, gender, education and region does not alter our conclusions. More
specifically, we replicated Figure 1 and 2 for the weighted dataset (see Figure D.1 and D.2 in the
Supplementary Material). One interaction out of twelve reaches p<.05, that is, the interaction
between age and treatment for the ‘no mask’ behaviour. Focusing on the coefficients rather than
p-values, our findings are very similar.

Third, we made sure that our results of the tests for heterogeneous treatment effects were not driven
by particular countries by estimating the effects with a model that includes country fixed effects.
Figure D.3 and D.4 replicate and Table D.1-4. shows the results of this test and leads to essentially
the same conclusion.

Fourth, we tackle the possibility that our results in fact are a “false positive” (Hoglinger and Jann
2018). In a nutshell, our experimental design is based on the assumption that the differences in the
proportion of self-reported non-compliance between the direct and the face-saving questions are
related to a reduction of incentives to report socially desirable behaviours. While we think this is
a very plausible assumption, we also examine the possibility that another mechanism might explain
our results (for example the mere change in the number of response options) using a Canadian
survey that was in field during the same period as the twelve surveys examined here. In this
Canadian survey, we used the same face-saving strategy but with a broader battery of items, 8
instead of 4. This larger battery included behaviours that were not officially prohibited, i.e. where
there should be much less social desirability. In panel A of Figure D.4, we show that there is a
strong effect of the treatment (about 10 percentage points) for behaviours that the government
prescribed, such as wearing a face-mask in public, and that this effect is much less important in

14

panel B (average of about 3 percentage points) for behaviours that perhaps entail a risk, but that
the government did not proscribe – such as taking public transportation or shopping for nonessential products. While we do not have these ‘placebo’ items for twelve countries included in
the analyses, this result for Canada is reassuring and increases our confidence that the greater
proportion of self-reported non-compliance in the face-saving group is not a ‘false positive.’

Fifth, we also check whether or not a potential experimenter demand effect (de Quidt et al. 2018)
might drive the results using data from a survey experiment in France. The design of the
experiment is presented in the Supplementary Material. Beyond both question formats analyzed
earlier, we rely on a list experiment (and a question used by Munzert & Selb (2020)) to estimate
the levels of compliance with preventive behaviors from alternative measurement strategies.
Results are shown in Figure D.5 of the Supplementary Material. The list experiment approach was
designed to reduce social desirability bias and is usually employed for this purpose (Blair and Imai
2012). Most importantly, the risk that there would be an experimenter demand effect is very
limited. Overall, even if this experiment only includes one country, using estimates from the list
experiment as a baseline brings no evidence of an experimenter demand effect associated to the
guilt-free question format that would systematically bias our estimates.
Discussion and implications
West et al. (2020: 451) argued that “there is an urgent need to develop and evaluate interventions
to promote effective enactment of these behaviours and provide a preliminary analysis to help
guide this.” We agree with the authors and address the issue of social desirability and its impact
on reported compliance with public health measures. While the work of Daoust et al. (2020) on

15

this topic showed a face-saving strategy is a promising approach to attenuate social desirability,
evidence was lacking on whether this face-saving strategy was effective beyond Canada.

In this research, we tested the face-saving strategy using a survey experiment in twelve countries
to examine the benefits of this approach. We replicated the findings of Daoust et al. (2020) and
most importantly, did so in a diverse set of contexts, with different countries and political systems,
in different stages of the pandemic (deconfinement in most countries), with different levels of
infections, etc. Based on four public health preventive measures related to the wearing of face
masks, greetings, hosting gatherings at one’s home, and social distancing, we found that the facesaving strategy increased the proportion of citizens who readily answer that they did not comply
for 47 out of 48 cases. Most importantly, the effects were substantial. They ranged from 9
percentage points (the mask item) to 16 percentage points (hosting at home) and are robust to
several additional tests. Given that there is no objective benchmark for the four preventive
measures analyzed in our study that are readily accessible for researchers, we must acknowledge
that there is no way to compare our estimates with external measures. Altogether, our experimental
design and extensive robustness checks bolster the conclusion that the differences we find can be
at least partly attributed to a social desirability bias.
There have already been major advances in the development of observational measures of citizens’
behaviour (i.e. not from survey data). Among others, France has recently used cameras in its
subway stations to quantify the proportion of people who wear a mask when in public transport,
and several countries are developing applications to track the inter-regional movement of their
residents (Olivier et al. 2020). While very useful, we cannot rely solely on behavioral data in the
fight against the pandemic. First, observational measures are not available for several important

16

preventive public health measures, as many measures cannot be examined in public, such as the
respect of social distancing if one hosts a gathering at their private home. Second, even behavioral
data like that obtained from cameras or tracing applications have some major drawbacks. Most
importantly, due to technical and privacy constraints this approach does not easily provide
researchers important auxilliary information about who complies and what makes people comply
or not. For these reasons, we believe that survey research is a crucial complement to other data
sources.

In summary, policy-makers and public health experts require survey data, and we should aim for
data of the best possible quality. Our research confirms that using a guilt-free strategy is an
effective approach and is relevant to anyone who aims to provide data on citizens’ compliance
with COVID-19 preventive measures. This type of data is crucial for governments and public
health agencies to make enlightened decisions. Moreover, as the strategy simply implies the
addition of a very short preamble and guilt-free answer choices, there are very limited additional
costs involved to implement this method compared to a direct question. While replications would
be welcome to strengthen the validity of the approach, we believe that our comparative research
provides a firm ground for what should become the standard when measuring citizens’ compliance
with public health preventive measures.

Note: Means with 95% confidence intervals are shown. D.Q. indicates estimation from the “dichotomous” question
format; P.Q. indicates estimation from the “polytomous” question format; F.S. indicates estimation from the “face
saving” question format; L.E. indicates estimation from the list-experiment estimation strategy. Masks refers to the
following items: Go shopping or take public transportation without a face mask or taking it off during it; Greetings
refers to the following items: Meet friends, family or colleagues greeting them by shaking hands, hugging or kissing;
Activities refers to the following items: Participate in social activities (work, sport, religious ceremony…) without
respecting physical distancing. Friends refers to the following items: Have a group of friends or family over at your
place without respecting physical distancing.

Data: We ran a quota-based online survey in France that was in field from July 9-19th. As nearly
all surveys in France, sampling was done using a quota method based on age, gender,
occupation, regions and type of residential area. The sample is designed to be representative of
the electorate’s features in each of the 12 metropolitan French regions. 10,686 respondents
answered our questionnaire.
The same four items included in the survey were:
•
•
•
•

Go shopping or take public transportation without a face mask or taking it off during it;
Meet friends, family or colleagues greeting them by shaking hands, hugging or kissing;
Have a group of friends or family over at your place without respecting physical
distancing;
Participate in social activities (work, sport, religious ceremony…) without respecting
physical distancing.

We used four different strategies to address the issue of social desirability. Three approaches
focusing on the question wording and answer options, and a list-experimental approach:
• First, a set of 1343 respondents were exposed to the following “dichotomous” question
wording discussed by Daoust et al. (2020): “Have you done any of the following
activities in the last week?”. The response categories were (1) yes, (2) no.
• Second we administered to another group of 1337 respondents the “polytomous” question
used by Munzert & Selb (2020) : “How often have you done the following activities in the
last week?”. The response categories were (1) daily, (2) several times, (3) once, (4) never.
• The third type of questions included is the “face-saving” question proposed by Daoust et
al. (2020): “Some people have altered their behaviour since the beginning of the pandemic,
while others have continued to pursue various activities. Some may also want to change
their behaviour but cannot do so for different reasons. Have you done any of the following
activities in the last week?”. 1345 respondents were to choose between the following
categories: (1) Yes, (2) Occasionally, (3) Only when necessary, (4) No.
• Finally, we also embedded a list experiment (Becher 2020; Larsen 2020; Munzert & Selb
2020) in this survey. Faced with a list of items, a fourth group of respondents were asked
how many things they had done last week, but not which specific ones. Respondents were
randomly assigned to either the control group (N=1334) or one of the four treatment groups
(N=1332; N=1331; N=1335; N=1329). The treated groups received an additional item
capturing the violation of the social distancing norm. The control group received a list of
four behaviours that are generally permissible under existing health recommendations. The
question reads as follow: “How many of these things have you done last week? You do not
need to tell me which ones you have done, just how many.” The following four activities
were listed: I went to the doctor or to the hospital; I watched a movie or TV show online
using a streaming service (e.g., Amazon, Netflix); I exercised outdoors; I ordered food
using an online delivery service. In addition to these four items, the treated groups received
one of the four more sensitive items we study. The estimated level of non-compliance was
obtained from the simple differences-in-means.
Turning to the results from these different approaches, as shown in Figure D.5., for 3 out of 4 items
the level of non-compliance estimated by the face-saving question (the estimates denoted by F.S.)
is in the 95% confidence interval of the level of non-compliance estimated by the list experiment
(the estimates denoted by L.E.). For one item, the face-saving estimate is 4.5 points below and for
both other ones it is 2 points higher. For the items related to mask-wearing, greetings and socialdistancing in activities, estimates from the dichotomous questions are systematically below the
list-experiment estimates and beyond its 95% confidence intervals. The “face-saving” treatment
does not seem to induce a systematic experimenter demand effect that would inflate noncompliance, at least compared with an alternative measurement strategy - list experiment – that is
well known for decreasing desirability bias (Blair and Imai 2012) and does not appear prone to
any experimenter demand effect due to the lack of any associated framing.
The pattern described above differs only for non-compliance in social distancing while hosting
friends. In this instance, the list experiment estimate is the lowest. Only the estimate from the
dichotomous question does not statistically differ from it. Both the estimates of the face-saving
and polytomous questions are significantly higher. The polytomous question is devoid of any
framing in the wording of the question. Therefore, even if we have no explanation for this

idiosyncratic pattern, it is unlikely that the higher estimate produced by the face-saving question
relative to the list experiment is due to a potential experimenter demand effect induced by the facesaving treatment.
Overall, even if this experiment only includes France, it brings no evidence of an experimenter
demand effect that would systematically bias our estimates.
