Abstract
Canadians are using a variety of social and non-social media vehicles to gather information,
share experiences and express anxieties during the COVID-19 confinement period. The
purpose of the study is to produce a portrait of media use in Canada, paying special attention
to the typical population segments in the Canadian population differentiated by their media
vehicles and sources of information about the pandemic. The study used as its data source a
survey sample of 4,600 adult Canadians aged 15 years old and over during the period of
July 20-26 2020, and collected by Statistics Canada. Media user activities comprised a set
of 11 dichotomous scales collecting data on main sources of information such as social
media posts, online news, online magazines, video platforms, e-mails as well as non
internet-based sources. A market segmentation analysis of these scales using Principal
Components and k-means cluster analysis revealed the presence of six major population
segments: Social Media Buffs (27%), News Followers (33%), Unplugged (10%),Plugged-In
(7%), E-Mailers (7%) and Mixed Source Users (16%). The segment mottos were as follows:
"Social Media Influencers Know Their Stuff!", "Track Those Headlines!", "I’ve Got My Own
Info Sources About The Pandemic!", "Did You Read The Last Blog?" "My People Know
Better!" and "Better Info Means More Choices!". This study suggests that media users in
Canada constitute a very diverse group of individuals who are engaged in social and non
social media to obtain timely information about the pandemic. However, they can also be
exposed to inaccurate, misleading information about the virus, its transmission and its
treatments. In this light, market segmentation may be a useful tool for decision makers
to categorize population members by their typical attitudinal traits and, by doing so,
facilitate better public campaigns directed at population segments, help design messages,

and implement changes that can promote more efficient ways to deal with their target
audiences.
1.0. Background
The COVID‐19 virus has caused major disruptions across the world, after being declared as a
pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 31 2020 (WHO, 2020). This
pandemic has led to several disruptions for most of the world's population. In Canada, the first
cases of infections were observed in travellers from China 2 and reported to the press in January
2020. Given a steady climb in cases, on March 25 2020, an emergency aid bill passed and Canada
made 14-day quarantine mandatory for all arrivals. Three days later Prime Minister Trudeau
announced a ban on air travel for those with COVID-19 symptoms. Canada is presently undergoing
the so-called "second" phase. As of October 25 2020, there had been a total of 9,946 deaths
attributed to the COVID-19 virus in Canada 3. A larger number is expected in the coming
months. Most of the reported cases are in Canada's two most populous provinces, Ontario and
Quebec, which have declared different sanitary measures and confinement restrictions to deal
with virus spread in the population.
With limited opportunities for social interaction and an increase in the amount of time spent in
the home, Canadians are spending more time on the internet, watching television and closely
following on-line news 4. While both digital and non-digital media can contain inaccurate or
misleading information, the availability of such information on the internet is growing at an
exponential rate. They have become critical sources of information during crises situations such
as the current COVID-19 emergency occurring in Canada (Drouin, 2020; Weiderhold, 2020).
Through them, individuals gather necessary information, follow developments and sanitary
guidelines, seek social support and/or express anxieties about traumatic events
New
technologies now offer both younger and older audiences alternative communication
opportunities from those offered by traditional media such as newspapers, radio and T.V.
(Valkenburg and Piotrowski, 2017). The choice of a particular information vehicle (digital or a
more traditional one), however, depends on multiple factors including the appeal of a particular
communication technology, social settings and media presence, familiarity with a particular
medium and personal factors such as the generational cohort to which the individual belongs
such as Generation Z, Generation X, Baby Boomers, etc. (see WEF, 2019)
Social media vehicles, in particular, comprise a wide spectrum of possibilities in terms of
communication exchanges. Online social media news platforms, for instance, allow readers to
be informed of breaking news as well as the ability to easily and quickly share this information
with family and friends. Social media influencers make regular posts about a topic on their
preferred social media channels (e.g. YouTube, Instagram). Online magazines (also called
"Webzines") and encyclopedias distribute interesting information materials on a regular basis
in their respective areas of expertise. Podcasts (digital audio files) can also be received by
subscribers while e-mails, which are often of a more personal nature, are distributed by
electronic means from one computer user to one or more recipients via a network. Video-based

platforms such as TikTok are popular during the confinement period because they enable users
to upload, convert, store and play back video content on the Internet. Zoom, Skype and Google
Hangouts, and other real-time videoconferencing platforms have replaced in-person meetings
in professional and personal settings. Online discussion forums and online blogs (e.g. Twitter,
Tumblr, Reddit) are also popular online discussion sites allowing people to hold conversations
in the form of posted messages. It should be noted, however, that information regarding the
COVID-19 pandemic is not necessarily limited to social media vehicles as many Canadians
prefer also to use more traditional sources of news such as T.V., radio, the printed press as well
as personal contacts which are deemed as the more "reliable" sources available to the
individual.
In this study, marketing segmentation is used to identify population segments who share
commonalities in terms of the type of media use and information sources about the pandemic
situation in Canada. Market segments are groups of individuals who are very similar in their
reaction to one or more mix of environmental elements and, as such, can be targeted by public
health and communication agencies aimed at promoting social well-being (Grover and Briens,
2006). In a typical psychographic segmentation analysis, for instance, individuals are divided into
different groups on the basis of psychosocial and other behavioural characteristics (Lin, 2002). This
technique divides the market into segments on the basis of interest, values, opinion, personality
characteristics, attitudes using techniques of factor analysis, cluster analysis and canonical
correlation (Tynan and Drayton, 1987).
Using a sample of the adult population of Canada, the central objectives of the marketing
segmentation analysis undertaken here is to break down the population into meaningful clusters of
individuals (homogeneous) in terms of their psychographic traits during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Three central questions guided the segmentation analysis: 1) What information sources (from
both social and non-social media) are the most commonly reported by Canadians during the
pandemic? 2) Can groups of individuals be differentiated into attitudinal and/or behavioural
segments or clusters according to their media use preference? and 3) What are the typical
socio-demographic, residential, employment and other psychosocial characteristics of the
members of these population segments? The CPSS-Series4 survey conducted by Statistics
Canada was regarded as an ideal data source chosen to empirically explore these three central
research questions and produce a statistical portrait of typical media users during the
pandemic 5.
2.0.Sample and Measures
The Canadian Perspective Survey Series4 (CPSS Series4) entitled "Information Sources
Consulted During the Pandemic" is a voluntary online survey that collected information
on knowledge and behaviours of approximately 4,600 Canadians aged 15 years old and
over who were residents of the 10 Canadian provinces. It was administered by Statistics
Canada between July 20 2020 and July 26 2020 (the reference week). The probability
panel of the CPSS-Series1 was created by randomly selecting a subset of the Labour
Force Survey (LFS) respondents. The CPSS Series4 survey collected a wide range of
information on health impacts, checking information sources, precautions to avoid risks,
This study is the fourth market segmentation study carried out using CPSS data. The first one, focusing on
routine activities which used CPSS-Series2 data, is available at: https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6vumh/

routine activities and others 6.
A total of 11 social media use dichotomous item scales were used for this analysis. These
tapped into the usage of social and non-social media sources for obtaining information on the
COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. Scales were measured as 0=No and 1=Yes. The following
general question was asked in the CPSS Series4 survey: Since the beginning of the COVID-19
pandemic, which of the following online sources have you used to find information on COVID19? (list provided). The roster of information sources scales ranked by their average scale
scores is presented in Table 1. The most frequently mentioned sources were Online News
(63%), Social Media News (35%) and Social Media Influencers (30%). As expected, the use of
non-internet sources was negatively correlated with all items related with internet-based
social media use. Combinations of utilization of these information sources were also observed.
The highest positive correlations were found between the social influencers source and online
news use (r=.27) and online magazine and online news use (r=.17).
3.0.Statistical Methods and Segment Identification
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and k-means cluster analysis were used as the main statistical
techniques for segment identification (see detail of the methodologies followed in Punj and Stewart
(1983), Grover and Vriens (2006) and Salkind and Rasmussen (2010). In the first phase, Principal
Components (statistical technique aimed at data reduction) extracted 4 major dimensions
underlying information contained in the 11 scales of social media use related items. In the second
phase, using component scores of these dimensions capturing 51% of the total data variation, kmeans clustering analysis was applied to the CPSS-Series1 data. This clustering algorithm was
developed to sort survey respondents into a k number of clusters through assignments and reassignments based on the shortest distance between the individual and the centroid (mass centre) of
the cluster. The distance measure chosen for this purpose was the Euclidean distance squared. For
the cluster analysis k=2 to k=8 segment solutions were tested. The k=6 solution proved to be the
most valid and informative according to the parsimonious reduction of the Within Sum of Squares
(WSS) and the application of the "elbow" criteria as a stopping rule in the partition of clusters (see
technical appendix chart A-1).
The validation of the partition of the population into six clusters was verified using Analysis of
Variance (ANOVA) F tests where the cluster membership was used in the prediction of the sociodemographic and attitudinal characteristics of respondents (see table A-2 in the technical
appendix). The highest predicted power of the cluster partition was found in reference to the age
group of individuals (7% of variance explained).

Statistics Canada has already released major findings of the CPSS-Series1, Series 2 and CPSS-3 surveys
(conducted between March 29-April 3 2020 and June 15-21 2020 respectively), which include: greater
anxieties over personal health and the health of others, that most Canadians were following health guidelines,
greater time spent on the internet and watching television, women were stricter in terms of following guidelines
than men, and youth were less likely to wear masks in public. Sources : 1)

4.0. Findings
4.1. Segment Prevalence and Traits
According to the cluster analysis of the CPSS-Series4 data, six uniquely profiled groups of the
Canadian adult population respondents were identified. Their membership was distributed as
follows: 27% in segment 1, 33% in segment 2, 10% in segment 3, 7% in segment 4, 7% in segment 5
and 16% in segment 6. Based on the social media use profiles drawn from the item scales, the
segments were labeled as follows: Segment 1 – "Social Media Buffs", Segment 2-"News Followers",
Segment 3-"Unplugged", Segment 4-"Plugged In", Segment 5-"E-mailers" and Segment 6 "Mixed
Source Users”. The prevalence 7 (adult population % share) of these segments is presented in pie

A visual representation (PCA bi-plot) of the vector of social media use items and dimensions
underlying the data are displayed in chart 2. The first two components extracted by PCA
accounted for 32.1% of the variance of all items. The first dimension represented by C1 (17.5%
of the total variance of items) opposed as polar cases members of the Plugged-In to the
Unplugged segments, revealing a digital vs. non-digital divide between social media users and
those using more traditional sources of information. The second dimension, represented by C2
(14.6% of the total variance of items), opposed Social Media Buffs and News Followers’
members. This opposition reveals a dimension related to more passive involvement vs. more
active involvement with social media. The biplot also reveals some interesting intra-group
distinctions according to the specific medium used (e.g. online magazine vs. blogs vs. e-mails).

7

Statistical Note: In the Chart 2 PCA bi-plot 8, the first two principal components extracted from
the data (C1 and C2) are shown. They are the most fundamental dimensions summarizing the social
media user activity patterns reported by respondents. In the biplot, vectors represent items which
are presented as points in space. The bi-plot of the second component on the first component is
useful as it displays the correlations of variables in terms of various item vectors of different
magnitudes, directions and positions. Proximity of user activity traits to group positions in space
suggests an over-representation of these traits with respect to the composition of groups while
greater distances suggests its converse. Correlations between two indicator variables in component
space are equal to the cosines of the angles between the indicator vectors (θ), or r = cos(θ). Highly
correlated variables are located at sharp angles from each other (θ = 90 degrees or less) while those
zero correlated are "orthogonal" to each other (θ = 90 degrees). If variables are perfectly negatively
correlated, then θ = 360 degrees (vector in opposite direction).

4.2. Segment Profile Summaries: Who Are They?
The following are the summary descriptions of the population segments found in the CPSSSeries4 data:
Segment 1 – Social Media Buffs (27% representing 8.5 million adult Canadians),
Segment Motto: "Social Media Influencers Know Their Stuff!"
One in four Canadians may be regarded as a social media buff (27%). To understand the
pandemic, segment members heavily consume social media news and postings from social
media influencers (66% and 68% respectively). Social media buffs were less stringent in terms
of information verification compared to members of the other segments: only 58% consulted
other sources as information check-ups or checked information for accuracy. Of those who did
not check, 41% did not think of checking the information at the time while 38% indicated that
"did not care to check". In terms of socio-demographic characteristics they tend to have an
over-representation of younger individuals (39% aged 35 years old or younger), females (57%)
and, in particular, had a child 18 years old younger living at home (43%). About half (48%)
had attained a level of education equivalent to a high school diploma or below. About 17%
reported either a fair or poor state of mental health and 15% moderate symptoms of
generalized anxiety during the pandemic.
Segment 2 – News Followers (33% representing 10.1 Million adult Canadians),
Segment Motto: "Track Those Headlines!"
This segment is the largest (one out of three Canadians) and comprises individuals who
consistently follow news and are up-to-date on current pandemic developments in Canada and
around the world. Online news and online magazines are their preferred sources of
information (93% and 7% respectively). They are not, however, necessarily concerned with
checking the information provided by the news services: only 56% checked the accuracy of this
information. The majority of them (62%) who did not checked declared that they did not do so
because "they trusted the source". About 64% of them detected false information in social
media at least once a week and only 35% realized that the original information presented
was, in fact, false. There was a slight over-representation of males in this particular segment
(52%) as well individuals in married or common-law relationships (63%). About 13% reported
either a fair or poor state of mental health and 11% moderate symptoms of generalized
anxiety during the pandemic.
Segment 3 – Unplugged (10% representing 3.0 million adult Canadians), Segment
Motto: "I’ve Got my Own Info Sources about the Pandemic!"
These individuals are social media-"averse" and primarily obtain their pandemic information
from personal contacts and other traditional media such as printed newspapers, books, T.V
and/or radio. They tend to be a relatively older cohort (43% were aged 65 years old and over),
females (55%) and half (50%) reported having an educational equivalent to a high school
diploma or below. Rural residents were also over-represented in this segment (23%). About
61% were not employed and possibly retired at the time of the survey. About 16% reported

10

either a fair or poor state of mental health and 14% moderate symptoms of generalized
anxiety during the pandemic.
Segment 4 – Plugged-In (7% representing 2.3 million adult Canadians), Segment
Motto: "Did You Read the Last Blog?"
Members of this elite segment are the "savants" of social media and utilize it intensively
through its different forms and manifestations. They obtain and share information about the
pandemic through all 10 of the social media activities recorded in the survey. About 76% of
them reported following on-line news, 58% social media influencers and 55% social media
news. A notable feature is their subscription to podcasts (47%), video platforms (39%) and
online discussion forums (45%). Plugged-In segment members were the more stringent in
terms of information verification: 89% consulted other sources as information validation and
read thoroughly the articles presented to them (71%). They also were among the most
comprehensive in terms of detecting false information at least once a week (73%) and also in
realizing that some original information presented was, in fact, false (49%). Individuals of this
segments tend to be younger (51% were aged 35 years old or younger), single (41%) and 41%
had attained a level of education equivalent to a bachelor university or above. About 62%
were employed at work for at least part of the reference weekk. In the terms of mental health,
one in four segment members (25%) reported either a fair or poor state of mental health and
17% were classified as having moderate or severe symptoms of generalized anxiety.
Segment 5 – E-mailers (7% representing 2.2 Million Adult Canadians), Segment
Motto: "My People Know Better!"
E-mailers do not rely only on pandemic-related information originating from e-mails sent by
family and friends (62%) but also from media such as online news (72%), social media news
(45%) and online media encyclopedias (42%). Segment members were not as stringent in
terms of information validation as those in the Plugged-In segment but did some verifications
of their own: 78% consulted with other sources while 69% checked the accuracy of the
information. About 41% validated this information through family, friends and their social
network. A notable feature about this segment is an over-representation of males (58%) and
foreign-born (40%). About 12% reported either a fair or poor state of mental health while 11%
were classified as having either a moderate or severe symptoms of generalized anxiety.
Segment 6 – Mixed Source Users (16% representing 5.0 Million Adult Canadians),
Segment Motto: "Better Info Means More Choices!"
Members of this segment are similar to the first Social Media Buff segment but differ from
them because of their somewhat higher use of video-based platforms (15%) to comprehend the
pandemic. They also had some communalities with News Followers population segment:
everyone (100%) reported accessing online news while 70% reported obtaining information
from social media influencers. About 78% of mixed sources users undertook some kind of
information verification through consultation with other sources of information. In terms of
socio-demographic characteristics they display some over-representation of younger media
users (36% aged 35 years old or under), females (54%) and more educated individuals (35%
had an equivalent diploma to a bachelor university or above). About 18% of the Mixed Sources

11

segment members reported a fair or poor level of mental health while 13% were classified as
having a moderate or high symptoms of generalized anxiety at the time of the survey.

5.0. Reflections
Given that the social and non-social media use are often city or region-specific, more
geographically focused studies are desirable. It should be noted that the available public
version of the CPSS-Series4 survey, regrettably, did not contain provincial or territorial
breakdowns and was limited to individual reporting during the “second” phase of the
pandemic. In the subsequent phases of the pandemic, shifts in the share of segment
composition are likely to occur. More frequent surveys carried out by Statistics Canada and/or
other data collection agencies may yield, in the future, important information on the common
transitions of individuals from one cluster to another.
How can health and other social agencies better reach the six population segments of media
users identified in this study? The answer to this question can be framed in terms of the type
and frequency of information they receive and their exposure to inaccurate, misleading
information about the virus, its transmission and its treatments. Public health officials can
mitigate the impact of misinformation by calling attention to it and directing users to verified
sources. Previous studies have found that inaccurate and misleading health-related social
media posts have been more popular than those containing verified, factual information (e.g.
Sharma et al., 2017). This is further compounded by the presence of algorithms on social media
platforms and other platforms that push content to users based on their preferences and
previous online behaviour (Pariser, 2012). In particular, when users are unaware of the
existence or effect of algorithms and do not carefully consider the source or accuracy of the
information they access, this could lead to poor and uninformed health-related decision-making
(Holone, 2016).
For Social Media Buffs, social media is not merely a source of information, but also a primary source
of entertainment and escape from the boredom and "mundanity" that resulted from lockdown
restrictions (Presky, 2020). Among other things, it allows users to connect and share experiences
with those that they may not be able to interact with in person due to confinement restrictions
potentially reducing feelings of self-isolation. Despite their avid use of social media, Social Media
Buffs as less likely to verify the accuracy of information than other segments. This may have serious
health implications say for vaccine distribution and administration as people might refuse a vaccine
on the basis of something they’ve read online. Public health officials may need to harness the social
power of celebrities and social media influencers to effectively target this segment. 9
The psychographics of the News followers segment in Canada is also interesting to highlight.
That online news sources were more frequently consulted than Social Media News and Social
Media Influencers is consistent with findings from other recent studies (i.e. Parsons Leigh et
al., 2020). This does not, however, provide a full picture on what sources Canadians are using
to obtain information about the COVID-19 pandemic because it does not account for the
behaviour of specific age-cohorts within this population segment. For example, while in 2018
75% of Canadians over the age of 15 reported using social media applications or websites, this
For example, the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University worked with actors from
the film Contagion to release public service announcements (PSAs) about dispel misinformation about
public health measures after the onset of the virus in North America. The PSAs can be viewed at

number was higher for Canadians between the ages of 15-24 years old (92.4%) and 25-44 years
old (88.1%) and significantly lower for Canadians 65 years old or over (45.6%). 10
Traditional non-digital media continue to play an important role in the dissemination of public
health information for members of the Unplugged segment, especially for older and rural
residents. Further, a small portion of the population reported receiving regular information
updates from friends and family via e-mail. Public health officials and other social agencies will
therefore need to continue to traditional forms of digital and non-digital media. Lower internet
and social media use for the Unplugged population segment could be, at least in part, attributed to a
lack or lower level of access to such services and platforms stemming from the absence of crucial
digital infrastructure and/or lower levels of digital literacy skills. This digital divide has been
connected demographic factors such as geographic location (i.e. rural vs urban), education and age
(Haight, Quan-Haase, & Corbett, 2014), populations overrepresented in Unplugged segment. In the
absence of internet access and/or social media use, it may be difficult to communicate information to
segment members quickly. These individuals may have limited access to in-person social networks
due to quarantine restrictions, with limited opportunities for online social interaction thereby
impacting their mental health. Data collected from social media use and internet searches can be
and has been used to track disease outbreaks (Schmidt, 2012). Lower levels of social media use
could impact the ability of public health officials to predict disease outbreaks.
Members of the elite "Plugged-In" segment consulted the widest variety of internet sources for
information about the pandemic and were vigilant when it came to verifying that information. This
likely meant that they spent the most time online following news of the pandemic, putting members
in this group at a higher risk of information overload, "cyberchondria", and negative mental health
impacts (Farooq, Laato, & Islam, 2020). It also became a primary destination for education and
employments as many students and workers moved online, further increasing "screentime” and the
likelihood of information overload or screen fatigue. Similar observations can be made with respect
to the members of the "Mixed Sources" segment identified in this analysis.
Finally, with respect to E-Mailers ,this population segment relies more heavily on word of mouth
communication from peers and close contacts than others. As word of mouth communication is
perceived to be more reliable and trustworthy than other sources, it is surprising that 69% of Emailer segment members engaged in fact-checking. Public health officials may be able to capitalize
on word-of-mouth communication by encouraging readers to share the information with friends and
family not only via social media but also by e-mail and other forms of communication. Lower levels
of social media use can be linked to the reduced levels of poor mental health and anxiety reported by
segment members. They maintained contact with their network via email while minimizing the
possibility for information overload.
Overall, this study suggests that the media users in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic
constitute a very diverse group of individuals. They are constantly exposed to a steady flow of
information, opinions, advice and judgments originating from individuals and/or agencies
which attempt to make sense of the epidemic and its wider societal impacts. Members of the six
population segments of media users are unique in terms of their digital or non-digital

preferences but share a common preoccupation in making sense of the current environment
and developing coping mechanisms to survive the pandemic. In this light, market segmentation
may be a useful tool for decision makers to categorize population members by their typical
attitudinal traits and, by doing so, facilitate better public campaigns directed at the various
population segments, help design messages, and implement changes that can promote more
efficient ways to deal with their target audiences.
