"12" "Abstract"
"13" "This study examine s the impact of the Dutch  ‘intelligent lockdown ’  during  the COVID-19 pandemic  on work and family dynamics among parents .  This ‘intelligent lockdown’ rel ied  on a combination of restrictive measures and  an  emphasis on individual responsibility  as a means of  lessen ing  the  spread and health  impact of the pandemic .  However, t he COVID-19 pandemic is more than a public health crisis. Lockdown measures had substantial  societal  effects, including a significant impact on parents with (young) children. Given gender inequality  existent  prior to the pandemic, the question arises to what extent the consequences of the lockdown varied for mothers and fathers.  Using representative survey data gathered among Dutch parents in April 2020, w e explore   changes in  three areas :  paid work, the division of care and household work, and quality of life (leisure, work-life balance, relationship dynamics) .  Our linear probability and multinomial logistic models  demonstrate that the way in which families were impacted  by the COVID-19 pandemic  reflects a complex gendered reality.  We  find  that g ender inequality  patterns  in the division of paid work, care work, and housework  continue   to exist .  Moreover, the  unique situation created by restrictive  lockdown  measures magnified some  inequalities  while others were lessened. We find evidence of  increased  gender  inequality in relation to paid work and quality of life,  yet a decrease in gender inequality in the division of care and household tasks . During the lockdown, Dutch fathers reported doing more care and household tasks than before.  The  insights  provided here  offer key comparative references for understanding the broader impact  of lockdown measures  on  work and family dynamics, as well as quality of life  as we move forward in the COVID-19 pandemic."
"14" "Introduction"
"15" "Gender inequality in paid work, care  work,  and household work, is one of the most persistent social problems of the 21 st  century   (1,2) . This ongoing inequality significantly affects men and women’s quality of life, including leisure time   (3,4) , work-life balance   (5,6) , and for those in a relationship, relationship dynamics   (7,8) .  The COVID-19 pandemic and far-reaching measures taken by governments to  reduce the spread of the virus   have the potential to substantially impact these patterns of gender inequality, especially within  families with children.  Particularly in the Global North ,  the pandemic further divided an already gendered labour market.  W omen are overrepresented in public sector occupations such as health care, education, and childcare  (9) .  In the health care sector alone, three-fourths (76%) of European workers are women  (10) .  Women are similarly overrepresented in health care and community/social service sectors in the US  (11)  and Australia   (12) .  These commonly underpaid and undervalued occupations  became  essential during the  COVID-19 pandemic;   consequently,  many mothers continued to work outside the home.   Simultaneously ,  other  female-dominated industries such as retail, accommodation services, and food and beverage service activities have been disproportionately affected by lockdown measures   with  shops and services in these industries terminat ing  their services .   T herefore ,  women  more than men  are likely to see the greatest  job  losses and  reductions in  working hours during the pandemic and its aftermath  (9) ."
"16" "Attempts to slow the spread of COVID-19   has  led to office closures and a sudden increase in  working from home .  In the US, early estimates suggest half of the workforce worked  or is working  from home  full   time during the pandemic   (13) . In Europe ,  more than  one third  (37%)  of  employees  were , on average,   working from home  at the height of the pandemic  in the spring of 2020 , although this percentage varied across countries, ranging from nearly 20% in Romania to nearly 60% in Finland .  Of those who  worked from home ,  one third were  parents with children under the age of 18  (14) .  The   lockdown measures  and subsequent increase in working from home  had the potential to impact gender dynamics within families because c hildcare centres and schools  were  temporarily  closed  in most countries.  Social distancing measures discouraged others, such as grandparents, from caring for (grand)children, therefore a lternatives to formal  or parental  care  were limited .  As a consequence, care and home-schooling responsibilities shifted fully onto parents."
"17" "H ow  do  the sudden changes introduced by COVID-19 lockdown measures impact these  work and family  dynamics ?  On the one hand, COVID-19 lockdown measures potentially  magnify  structural gender inequalities, for example by reaffirming women’s caregiving role   (15,16) . Initial evidence from countries such as Australia, the UK, the US, and Germany confirm  this  effect  (17–19) .  I n these countries, women spend more time each day on care tasks than men, resulting in an increase  on  time spent on caregiving tasks during the pandemic. In Australia, Cooper and  Mosseri   (18)  suggest women experience a triple burden  during the pandemic :  many women   face stressful and risky work on  the frontlines given their overrepresentation in essential occupations,  women  are witnessing the greatest losses in jobs and hours, and  women’s  unpaid care tasks at home have increased.   On the other hand, COVID-19 lockdown measures have the potential to  reduce  existing  social  inequalities .   G iven women’s overrepresentation in essential occupations  and the concurrent push for  non-essential workers  to work from home ,  as well as the absence of care alternatives,  families  may be forced  to (re)negotiate the division of care  and/or  household work   (20) . In the US, for example, Carlson, Pepin and Petts  (19)   show that while women still do more caregiving tasks than men, men are doing more than before the pandemic, and almost no men report doing less."
"18" "For a   thorough  understand ing of   the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gender inequality ,   more evidence is needed  from  other  countries ,   as country  context  is crucial  for understanding social processes  (21) .  There is significant cross-national variation in l ockdown  measures and supportive social policies in place   (22) , making country context  vital for understanding the short and long-term impact of COVID-19 on gender inequality.  The Netherlands presents an interesting case study  for furthering this evidence base  for two reasons .  First ,  the Netherlands  was criticized internationally for  its unique and comparatively  lenient  approach to  the  COVID-19  lockdown   (23) .   Known as an ‘intelligent lockdown’  and  meant to  restrict the spread of the virus but at the same time minimize  the economic, social and psychological impact of the pandemic,  r estrictive measures  put   in place from  15 March  onwards  emphasised individual responsibility  rather than state enforcement. This approach  was viewed as  relatively  ‘soft’  compared to other European settings   (24) .  In reality, some measures were strict while others could be considered lenient. Strict measures included the closing of childcare centres, schools and universities; Online classes and homework replaced on-site education to prevent student delays. Emergency care  and schooling  for children aged 0-12 was available to workers in essential occupations (including care (both youth care and social support),  (emergency)  childcare, public transport, the food chain (e.g. supermarkets), the transport industry, waste/garbage collection/processing, media and communication, education, emergency services, necessary government processes, farming, and occupations in the funeral industry ).  Families  for whom one parent had an essential occupational while the other did  not, were   asked  to  realize  their own care arrangements; Emergency care and schooling was intended as a last resort.   Further strict  lockdown  measures included the prohibition of p ublic gatherings and events,  which  effectively clos ed  down firms and entrepreneurs in the catering and events sector.  B ars ,  restaurants,  hairdressers,  gyms ,  and saunas  were closed.  Other measures, however, were  less strict and  open to interpretation. Shops and businesses able to maintain social distancing requirements  at   work   could   choose to  continue operations –  either  from home or on-site  – at  their own discretion.  C itizens  were resolutely asked to stay at home , and all non-essential workers were expected to full-time work from home.   Y et  public spaces remained  accessible and  people  were not required to have written authorization for outings ,  travel  or use of public transport   (24) .  However, w hile f amilies retained the possibility to spend time outside in the company of other household members or one non-family member as long as social distancing was maintained (1.5 meters distance between non-family members) , social life effectively came to a standstill and leisure activities were  significantly impacted ."
"19" "Second,  the Dutch case is interesting  for investigating dynamics in gender inequality because  in comparison to other European countries, the Netherlands consistently scores high on gender equality indices in the domains of work, health and knowledge  (25) . Yet these high scores mask persistent and underlying gender inequality in multiple domains, particularly in relation to paid work and care. For nearly three decades now, the Netherlands has been dominated by its ‘one-and-a-half earner model’:  F athers work full-time,  mothers work part-time  and spend significantly more time caring for children and doing household tasks  (26–28) . To date, insufficient pressure existed to challenge the structural inequalities embedded in this Dutch work and family model   (29) . Against this backdrop, an  ‘ intelligent lockdown ’   has the potential to be  a catalyst for change."
"20" "As the strategy to move out of lockdown measures unfolds worldwide, social science insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gender inequalities in paid work , unpaid work (housework  and care ), and quality of life  are crucial for  understanding the effects of the pandemic on soci etal development and the need for short and long-term policy responses .  In this exploratory study, w e aim to provide evidence on the immediate effects of COVID-19 measures by studying how parents cope d   during   the intelligent  lockdown in the Netherlands.  We  aim to  answer the question: To what extent did the  Dutch  COVID-19  ‘intelligent  lockdown ’  increase or decrease gender inequality in work and family dynamics? We contribute to the emerging literature on the soci etal  effects of the COVID-19 pandemic by investigating three main themes  for working parents : 1) paid work (work location, working days and times,  perceived work pressure); 2) the division of care and household tasks; and 3) quality of life (leisure, work-life balance, and relationship dynamics).  Providing this exploratory evidence  will  help  inform labour market and family policies as well as broader social science debates on gender inequality  during pandemics ."
"21" "Materials and methods"
"22" "The data used here are the first of four waves of longitudinal data being collected for the COVID Gender (In)equality Study Netherlands (COGIS-NL).  Data were collected using a survey module administered to members of the Dutch Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) panel. The LISS panel is a  representative,  long-running random sample of individuals registered by the Dutch national statistics office (Statistics Netherlands). The panel consists of approximately 7,000 individuals (4,000 households). The survey was administered by  CentERdata , located at Tilburg University, the Netherlands.  Fieldwork took place between 13 and 28 April 2020, one month following the start of the intelligent lockdown."
"23" "Sample"
"24" "The requested sample frame  included  all panel members in a household with at least one member in paid employment and at least one child under the age of 18  living at home . This resulted in a selection of 1,234 panel members . W ith a  response rate  of  71.3% ,   the  final sample  consisted  of  868 respondents in 643 households.  A further  16 respondents were excluded from the final analytic sample as their registration in the panel did not match the sampling frame requirements. The final analytic sample consisted of 852 respondents, 748 of whom were in paid  work  at the time of the survey.  Most respondents were in a partnered household;  a  total of 71  single parents are included in the sample ."
"25" "Measures"
"26" "Measures for the survey were  tested and  developed  extensively  using a multi-step approach.  The first step  involved developing an initial set of questions  investigating the situation at work and home. These questions were  established  using our knowledge of the literature. Following, we focused on removing  and/or adding  questions  based on project  discuss ions, time available within the panel (7 minutes), and by comparing our question base with existing LISS modules  that can be linked to new data using unique individual and/or household identifiers . In a final step, multiple rounds of pilot testing led to the refinement  and finalization  of  the survey  questions.  During fielding, all panel respondents are asked if they have comments on the survey;  few respondents provided  these  (either positive or negative)  on our  questionnaire. The final codebook including all measures is  available from the LISS archive   (30) ."
"27" "Dependent variables"
"28" "We explore three themes  before  and  during the lockdown for both the respondent and  their  partner .  All measures  were  self-assess ed  and reported by one respondent.  First, we explore the impact on paid work dynamics by assessing changes to  work location ,  the  timing of work ,  and perceived work pressure. Work location measure d  whether respondents  and/or their partner  work ed  from hom e , work ed  at  the  usual location (required and voluntary), combine d   working from home   with  work ing  at  the  usual location,  or were temporarily furloughed (at  home because there is currently no work  to do ). The change in timing of work includes separate analyses for working more or less on  normal  workdays,  normal  days off, evenings, and weekends. Lastly, perceived work pressure measure d  whether respondents experience d  more or less work pressure during the lockdown versus prior to the lockdown."
"29" "Second, t o assess  dynamics  at home we asked respondents about the division of care and household tasks . We used  relative measures, with respondents asked to indicate, relative to their partner, how much housework  and  care giving tasks  (including home schooling and help with homework) they  did  before and during the lockdown   using  a 7-point scale ranging from  ‘ I do nearly everything ’  to  ‘M y partner does nearly everything ’ .  Third, quality of life was assessed by exploring changes in leisure time ,  perceived work-life balance, and relationship dynamics (disagreements with partners related to the  location of work, the  division of  care and household  tasks ,  and leisure time).  Leisure time  was  measured on a 5-point scale, ranging from having much less leisure time  compared to   before  the lockdown, to having much more  leisure  time.  W ork-life balance  was measured using an  adapted  measure from the European Foundation of Living and Working Conditions (EUROFOUND) Quality of Life survey ,  measuring  how easy or difficult  it was for parents   to  combin e  paid work with care (including home schooling and homework; measured on a 5-point scale from very easy to very difficult).  Lastly, we measured relationship dynamics by asking respondents how often they had disagreements with their partner before and during the pandemic about  work location, scheduling of working hours,  housework, caring for children, and/or free time."
"30" "Independent variables and controls"
"31" "We are primarily interested in  exploring  gender differences;  our gender  measure is included from  existing  LISS core modules  with a binary variable ( wo men=reference category).   We also included o ccupation  as an independent variable,  measured through self-assessment . Respondents were provided  the government list of essential occupations  and asked whether they (non-essential=reference category) and/or their partner  (partner in non-essential occupation=reference category)  worked in an essential occupation .   In addition, we  control led  for several socio-demographic characteristics, including sector ( (semi)- public, private   sector =reference category , sector unknown ) ,  age (in years , centred on the grand mean ), educational level ( low :   primary or  secondary qualifications=reference category ;  medium :   vocational qualification s ;  high :  t ertiary education ), number of children, and  school status of children  under 18 living in the household (measured here as children of primary-school age, children of secondary-school age, children of both primary-school and secondary-school age, and children  not attending school =reference category . This category includes both children under school age (0-4 )  as well as children who have already finished  secondary school ."
"32" "Descriptive data on the sample using these measures can be found in Table  S 1 a . In line with international trends  (20) , Dutch mothers were overrepresented in essential occupations. Half of all working mothers (56%) were employed in an essential occupation during the lockdown, compared to 34% of fathers. As such, mothers constituted 65% of all essential workers.  We note that based on average marginal effects, Dutch fathers were less likely (16 percentage points) to work in an essential occupation than mothers  (see Table S1b) . As to be expected, most essential workers were employed in the (semi)public sector."
"33" "Fifty-seven percent of households and 46% of respondents in the sample reported that at least one parent was employed in an essential occupation. Sixty-one percent of these households reported that one parent was an essential worker while the other was either not in employment or employed in a non-essential occupation, suggesting the other parent might potentially adjust their work and care hours to match those of the essential worker. The remaining households contained families where both parents were employed in essential occupations (28%) and single-parent households (10%).   These differences could have important ramifications for the division of paid work, household and care work, and parents’ quality of life, as measured through changes in leisure time, work-life balance, and relationship dynamics.   We also note that  almost all parents in our study (94%) indicated their children were at home either full-time (88%) or part-time (6%) as a consequence of the general closure of  schools and childcare centres  during the measurement period . The remaining  6 % of children were not at home, and thus in emergency childcare/school."
"34" "Methods"
"35" "In the results section, we report  descriptive  findings  ( percentages based on  crosstabulations ; tables reported  in online appendi ces )  supported by multivariate modelling  (tables displayed)  to  control for occupation,  partner occupation,  age, sector, education, number of children and school status of the children.  We use l inear regression modelling  for continuous outcomes and linear probability modelling (LPM)  for binary outcomes (0/1 outcomes) . These include the timing of work, the division of care work and housework, leisure time, and relationship dynamics . LPM  is a linear regression model on a binary outcome , which  is  generally  preferable to logistic regression for binary outcomes as  odds ratios cannot be interpreted as effect measures  in mediation or interaction models in logistic regression   (31,32) .  Odds ratios  reflect unobserved heterogeneity which can  make it difficult to compare across  models or groups.  LPM  yield s  unbiased and consistent estimates of a variable’s average effect on the chance that the  outcome  occurs. The b-coefficients in LPM can be  interpreted  as average marginal effects , whereby each coefficient represents  a discrete change from the base level holding all other measures constant at their means.  Note that average marginal effects report the differences in  percentage   points .  Multinomial logistic modelling is used for nominal outcomes  (three or more unordered categories in the dependent variable) . Multinomial logistic models estimate binary outcomes for all comparisons among the dependent categories, which is not possible  using  LPM   (33,34) .  We use multinomial logistic regression to explore work location , working time  and perceived work pressure , where we report the more easily interpreted odds ratios over logistic coefficients ."
"36" "Results"
"37" "Our results show that t he Dutch intelligent lockdown ,  intended to mitigate the  health,  social and economic impact of the pandemic, significantly impacted Dutch parents’ paid work patterns, divisions of care and housework, and quality of life."
"38" "The gendered impact on paid work: who works where and when?"
"39" "Work location"
"40" "Prior to the lockdown,  working from home was possible but not prevalent in the Netherlands   (35,36) .  The COVID-19 pandemic substantially impacted these  patterns .  A lmost  half ( 49 %) of the working parents in the sample reported working all (38%) or part (11%) of their hours from home  due to the COVID-19  lockdown  measures  in April 2020  (see Table S2 a ) .  However, it would be misleading to suggest  everyone worked from home.  In our sample, a small share (5%) of working parents indicated they worked most of their hours from home prior to the lockdown, and continued to do so during the lockdown. In addition,  substantial shares (42%) of Dutch parents continued to perform work tasks outside the home during the lockdown , perhaps because the Dutch intelligent lockdown allowed businesses and shops to remain open . A small group of respondents (7%) reported being allowed to work from home but chose not to do so.  The remainder of the parents not working from home (35% of working parents) indicated they worked on location because their work could not be performed from home.  Finally, 4% of parents indicated having a job but being at home without work due to the COVID-19 lockdown measures, suggesting a small proportion of parents was temporarily furloughed."
"41" "No clear gender differences  emerged from  our analyses (see table S2b.). T he multinomial logistic regressions  with regard to parents who worked all their hours from home,  which c ontrolled for  respondent and spouse’s employment in essential versus non-essential occupations , age, sector, education, number of children and school status of the children , are shown in Table 1 .  W ork location is primarily associated with respondents’ employment in essential versus non-essential occupations. Compared to the reference  category  of working all hours from home due to COVID-19, respondents in essential occupations were 3.4 times more likely to work part of their hours from home, 8.9 times more likely to work in their normal workplace by choice ,  and 4.7 times more likely to work in their usual location due to the nature of their  work . These effects are the same for mothers and fathers, as indicated by the non-significant interaction terms.  Thus, while essential workers were disproportionately women, no additional gender effect was found.  A notable  exception is that f athers were three times more likely than mothers to work in their normal workplace by choice, compared to working all hours from home , although this effect is only marginally significant ."
"42" "While the focus here is on gender differences, we note a key finding with our control variables. Variation  in work location reflect s   differences in  educational  background, which raises questions about the varying impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for lower and higher educated parents . Highly educated  parents  were substantially more likely to relocate their work to the home :  54% worked entirely from home and  13 % performed at least some of their work from home. In contrast, 65% of low educated workers reported working in their usual location because of the nature of their job; 59% of workers with a post-secondary vocational degree did as well  (see Table S 2 c ) .   Specifically, parents with tertiary education were 93.3% less likely than their low educated peers to work in their normal location because their work could not be performed from home compared to working all hours from home."

"206" "W orking  time   adaptations"
"207" "As a result of the lockdown  and  the temporary closure of schools and childcare centres , Dutch parents adapted the  days and  times at which they work ed .  Almost  two-fifths (38%)  of  Dutch  parents report ed  working less or much less  on  their  normal  wor k days  compared to  the situation prior to COVID-19  (see Table S 3 a ) .  Substantial shares of parents work ed  more or much more in the evenings (40%) and  during  weekends (31%). Mothers were more likely to adapt their work ing   times :  W hile  49 % of father s  reported  adapting the days on which they  normally  work during the lockdown, compared to situation prior to  the COVID-19  pandemic ,  61 % of mothers  adapted theirs :   Forty-one percent  worked  (much)  less   on  their  normal  work days  and  20%   reported working  (much)  more on these days .  For  Dutch  fathers, these percentages were 35% and 14% respectively.  Mothers were more likely than fathers (48% versus 31%) to work  (much) more  on days  they would normally have off ."
"208" "Multinomial logistic regressions, c ontrolled for  respondent and spouse’s employment in essential versus non-essential occupations , age, sector, education, number of children and school status of the children ,  show  that   employment in an essential versus non-essential  occupation  moderates the se  gendered   work   dynamics.   As  T able 2 shows, fathers were 5 6 % less likely to  work  (much)  less on their  normal  workdays  and 44% less likely to  work  (much)  more on their   normal  workdays. Fathers’ lower relative probability of having reduced work during  normal  working  days  does not apply to those in essential occupations, as evidenced by the positive interaction term.  M others in crucial occupations were also less likely  to have reduced working  on   normal   working days .  The reduction in work during  normal  workdays was particularly prevalent among mothers employed in non-essential occupations.  Fathers’ greater tendency to work  at  normal  times  is mirrored in their lower relative probability of increasing or decreasing work on normal days off (except for fathers in essential occupations) .   Net of gender, h ighly educated parents  also experienced  more changes   to times at which work was  done  (Table  2 ) .  Compared to low educated parents,  highly educated parents  were  3.2 times   more likely to  have  reduce d   work  and  3.6 times more likely to  have  increase d   work on their  normal   workdays .  T he multinomial logistic regressions for further adaptations in working times (working on normal days off, working during evenings and weekends) can be found in Tables S3b-S3 d."

"329" "The  data  demonstrate  the  lockdown  led to a n increase   in work pressure for  one-third (36%) of  Dutch parents ; these parents  experienced  more work pressure  in April  than prior to the lockdown  (see Table S4) . Perceived  changes in  work pressure differed significantly among mothers and fathers , both in terms of who experienced  an increase  and who experienced  a decrease in  work pressure.  Remarkably, m others were significantly more likely than fathers to experience both  more  work pressure (39% versus 31%) as well as  less  work pressure (25% versus 19%)  than before the lockdown ."
"330" "Amongst our control variables ( occupation, partner occupation, age, sector, education, number of children and school status of the children), essential occupation matters for  perceived work pressure  (see Table 3) .  P arents  in  an essential occupation  were 2.6 times more likely to report  increased work pressure  during the lockdown , compared  to  parents  not working in  an essential occupation.  As with our other analyses, we also find that educational level  matters  in relation to work pressure. Higher educated parents were more likely to experience changes in work pressure than lower educated parents, with an increased likelihood of experiencing less work pressure as well as more work pressure during the lockdown compared to before."

"442" "The gendered impact on household  work  and  care"
"443" "Whereas the lockdown appeared to magnify the inequalities in  paid work  between mothers and fathers, inequality in the division of household work and care declined.  Mothers still do the lion ’s  share  of   care and household tasks, but  the gap  between mothers and fathers  declined  some  as  fathers did more during the lockdown than before."
"444" "Car ing for children: a changing role for fathers?"
"445" "The intelligent lockdown led to a general increase in care tasks for roughly one-fifth of parents: Compared to the situation before the lockdown, 17% of parents  reported   doing a relatively higher share of  care tasks during the lockdown  (see Table S5 a ) . This share was significantly higher among fathers (22%) than mothers (12%).  We also find that a similar percentage of parents (about one-fifth) reported doing less care tasks relative to their partner during the lockdown in comparison to the situation prior to the crisis. Here there are only  negligible differences between mothers and fathers.  While  more  fathers  than mothers  reported  an increase in the  relative  share of   care tasks  performed  during the lockdown  compared to the situation before, the overall division  of care between mothers and fathers  remains unequal . A majority of mothers (60%)  still  reported doing (much) more care tasks than their partner during the lockdown  (see Table S5b) . In contrast,  only  10% of fathers reported doing (much) more care tasks than their partner during the lockdown. One- third of parents (34%)  reported  that  prior to the lockdown ,   care  tasks were divided more or less equally, during the  lockdown  this  remained  about the same (35%)."
"446" "B ased on the average marginal effects,  and controlled for occupation, partner occupation, age, sector, education, number of children and school status of the children, the increase in fathers’ relative share of care work is significant  (see  T able 4) .  Compared to mothers, f athers had a greater chance (9 percentage points) of reporting  an increase in the  relative  share of care tasks  performed during the lockdown  than before.  I n addition to gender , c hanges in  the  division of care tasks  were  clearly related to occupation .  P arents who work ed  in an  essential  occupation  had a  significantly  smaller chance (13  percentage points ) of   doing more  care tasks  during the lockdown than   before .   The analys i s of  decreases  in the relative share s  of care tasks  shows the opposite;  p arents working in essential occupations had a significantly greater chance (14 percentage points) of reporting  a decreased   relative  share of care tasks during the lockdown in comparison to parents working in non-essential  occupation s .  H aving a partner  in a non- essential occupation  did not appear to influence  whether respondents reported doing more or less care tasks during the lockdown compared to before ."

A small  proportion  of parents (12% in total)  reported  doing  more in the household  during the lockdown in comparison to before  (see Table S6a) . Fathers (17%)  reported this   significantly  more often than mothers (7%). A total of 13%  of parents  reported doing  less  household work in comparison to before  the lockdown , with only negligible differences  between fathers and mothers.  The division of tasks was and remained unequal, with mothers doing more than fathers.  Two-thirds   ( 65% ) of all mothers  reported doing (much) more household work than their partner  during the lockdown  ( see Table S6 b ).  Among  fathers,  only 10%  indicated  they did  (much) more  than their partner during the lockdown.  Similar to the division of care tasks, roughly one third (32%) of parents indicated  a more or less equal division of household tasks  during the lockdown."

Th is  decline in  leisure  time is significantly gendered. M ore than half of the mothers (57%) indicated they had less free time than prior to the lockdown ,   in  compar ison  to 36% of fathers.  These effects remain after controlling for  occupation, partner occupation, age, sector, education, number of children ,  school status of the children ,   and  for furloughed respondents who reported  “there is no work for me to do now”  (see Table 6).  The table shows that  parents with an essential occupation faced reduced free time  more often  compared to parents without an essential occupation .  Having children in primary school was also a significant  explanatory  factor for  differences in  leisure time: Parents with primary school-aged children  were significantly more likely to  experience  having less  free time  during the lockdown  than befor e, in comparison to parents with children in secondary school ."

"711" "The  intelligent   lockdown   and perceived work-life balance"
"712" "Due to the lockdown,  more  parents  face d  difficulties  in  combin ing  work with caregiving responsibilities. The deteriorat ion in  work-life balance  during the lockdown was  equally pronounced  between  mothers and fathers. Few parents (11%) indicated they found it ( somewhat  to very) difficult to combine work and care before the lockdown  (see Table  S 8 ) . During the lockdown,  however, nearly one - third (29%) of parents perceived the combination  of work and care to be somewhat to very difficult, an increase of 18 percentage points .   Looking at changes in work-life balance, o ne-third   ( 34% )  of parents  report ed  having greater difficulty combining work and care d uring the lockdown than before, and only a small group of parents (9%) perceive d  the current situation as favourable for their work-life balance  (See Table S 9 ) ."
"713" "Controlled for occupation, partner occupation, age, sector, education, number of children and school status of the children, gender  is  insignificant. Rather  than gender differences , e ducation al level  and the stage of schooling of children  appear to explain variation in perceived work-life balance during the lockdown  (see  T able  7 ). Based on the average marginal effects, higher educated parents had a significantly greater chance (1 6  percentage points) of  facing increased  difficulty combining paid work and care  during the lockdown  in comparison to parents with  low ( primary or secondary )  education.  Th is  effect is even larger for parents with  children of primary school age.  Having primary school aged children significantly increased the chance of experiencing difficulty combining work and care (by 28 percentage points)."

"798" "Relationship dynamics:  marginal  increase s  in d isagreements between partners"
"799" "Our final measure of quality of life relates to relationship dynamics:  T he extent to which partners experienced disagreements about the location of work, the division of care or household tasks, or the amount of free time.  Most parents indicated that prior to  the  lockdown , they never had disagreements  on  most of these  topics, including where they or their partner  worked ( working at the normal work location (7 9 %) ;  working from home (7 2 %) ) , or  the amount of  free time (56% ; see Table  S1 0 ).  However ,  prior to the lockdown,  about half of parents  experienced monthly (or more  frequent )  disagreements about the division of care  tasks  (51%) ,  and  60 %  quarrelled  about household tasks. The  lockdown did not change  this situation for  most parents. A  majority  of parents  ( between  62 % and  71% , depending on the measure )  reported   no change in the  prevalence of disagreements in all areas  during the lockdown  (the normal work location, working from home, caring for children, household chores,  and  leisure time ; s ee Table S1 1 ) ."
"800" "These relationship dynamics were the same for mothers and fathers, even  after  controll ing  for  occupation, partner occupation, age, sector, education, number of children and school status of the children.  The only  significant  increase  in  disagreements  was  reported  amongst a proportion of parents in relation to  the division of care tasks .   One-fifth of parents reported an increase in disagreements about the division of care tasks, with no differences related to gender  ( see T able  8 ) .  However, parents with  children in primary school   had a higher chan c e of  report ing   an increase in  disagreements about the division of care tasks  ( 13   percentage points )  than  parents  with  children in  secondary school ."

"885" "Discussion and conclusion"
"886" "The lockdown measures  taken in the  s pring of 2020  to curb the spread of COVID - 19 in the Netherlands  clearly  impact ed   Dutch  parents.  Many p arents experience d  significant changes in  paid work (including  where  and when  they work ed ,  and  subjective work pressure ) , the  division of household  and  care tasks, and  quality of life (the amount of  leisure  time , as well as the perceived ease or difficulty of combining  work and care  tasks  and  negotiating  about  these tasks  with their partner ) ."
"887" "Our study   indicates that th is  impact of  the  COVID-19 lockdown measures  on Dutch parents was  gendered.  The emergence of (and in some cases worsening) of gender inequalities is evident across  multiple areas .  M others adapt ed  the times at which they work, more so than fathers. Mothers not in essential occupations adapted their working times even more, and were more likely to experience increased work pressure during the lockdown.  At  home, the division of household and care tasks remained unequal. More mothers than fathers reported doing relatively more housework and care tasks than their partner , before  the  lockdown as well as during  the  lockdown .  We do find limited evidence of a reduction in gender inequality in the division of care and household tasks , however .  While  mothers  continued  doing  more  household and caregiving tasks  than fathers , the gap decreased somewhat as fathers  reported  do ing  (somewhat) more during lockdown.  We do not find that mothers experience d   a more pronounced  overall decline in the quality of life  in comparison to fathers.   Leisure time, an important indicator of quality of life, dramatical ly  decreased during the lockdown for mothers , yet  m others  and  fathers  equally  experience d  a worsening of work-life balance  and  an increase in   disagreements about  the negotiation of the division of housework  and  care tasks."
"888" "The changes in caregiving and household tasks  provide some reason  for optimism.  While mothers still do the lion’s share of caregiving and household tasks, the increased involvement of fathers in these tasks during the  lockdown  offers an opportunity  and potential  catalyst   for  further erosion of traditional role  patterns   in the  division of household and care tasks. Prior to the lockdown, Dutch couples routinely reported wanting an equal division of work and care, yet fathers remained more likely to participate in paid employment, with mothers taking on a higher caregiving burden  (28) .   The question now remains whether these  changes  towards  a more equal division of care  and  household tasks  will be sustained as the Netherlands relaxes lockdown measures and returns to a ‘new normal’."
"889" "Alongside the gender differences explored here, our study also raises questions about the effects of working in an essential occupation  as well as  working from home, especially with regard to quality of life. We found that  p arents  working in an essential occupation  experienced the highest levels of work pressure  during  the  lockdown ,  which can  result in health-related risks, such as burnout.  These workers  were also less likely to work from home. Workers in essential occupations, more often mothers than fathers, and the low er  educated, largely continued to perform work in their usual workplace. As a result, these  workers  face larger risks of exposure to the COVID-19 virus, especially if they work in care occupations, use public transport to get to work ,  or interact closely with colleagues."
"890" "Meanwhile, our study also indicates that working from home, largely heralded in the media and by politicians as ‘the new normal’, is reserved primarily for highly educated parents working in public sector, non-essential occupations.  These parents  face potentially larger risks related to the blurring of work and  family  time, as evidenced by their greater tendency to deviate from their  normal   work  days  and  times. Future research must consider the long-term effects of (not) working from home for mothers and fathers, especially with regard to their health and quality of life.   In particular, the future world of work is expected to enable  greater accessibility of  working from home. Based on our findings, we can speculate about what this  might  imply for gender inequalit y . On the one hand, it could be that more opportunities  to  work from home (and increased flexibility in working hours)  would  enable mothers to increase their participation  in paid work . On the other hand, unfavourable side effects can be expected when we consider our finding that fathers more often chose to go to the workplace during lockdown even when they could work from home, whereas mothers more often worked from home. In the future, such differences may result in gender inequality with mothers possibly becoming  ‘online’ workers, with potentially fewer career and networking opportunities, and a greater blurring of work and family life. Although working from home  can be advantageous to some  workers, employers need to anticipate and monitor potential  for  unfavourable side effects. Future research needs to closely  follow  the effects of  the  more intensive forms of working from home that have been introduced in many countries  as a result of the pandemic ."
"891" "The gender and educational inequalities (a proxy for class inequalities) exacerbated by or brought about by the lockdown measures are  also  cause for concern. While mothers’ greater adaptability need not be  problematic  in and of itself, the larger decrease in  free time among  mothers and  the increased  perception of work pressure  among mothers  in comparison to fathers, is. People with insufficient free time experience a poorer quality of life as well as reduced health and well-being  (3) . Greater perceived work pressure and difficulty combining work and care can also have long-term negative effects. Employees who experience high stress, high work load and time constraints for a long period of time are less productive, are more likely to suffer from burnout complaints and are more likely to switch jobs compared to employees who are feeling well   (37–39) .  This is especially true when employees have insufficient time to recover from work stress on a day-to-day basis  (40) .  High levels of perceived work pressure, both before and during the lockdown, among mothers and among workers in occupations considered to be essential for society is therefore worrisome . Particularly   as  mothers also experience insufficient  leisure time,  which  can be a sign  of insufficient recovery . These concerns are even greater when considered in relation to growing staff shortages in some of  the  occupational groups  where mothers are overrepresented  (e.g., care and education)."
"892" "We note a number of limitations of our  exploratory  study , primarily related to data   availab ility . Data on the  age  of the  youngest child  are unavailable. The  distinction  made here based on the phase of schooling addresses this issue only partially. Future research will need  to account for the age of children, particularly in order to distinguish the pressure of care tasks for children younger than school age versus children living at home, but no longer attending school. In addition, data on working hours would be useful , particularly in the Dutch case; mothers working  part-time might be the ones adapting their work situation more than full-time working mothers. Lastly,  while  we have been able to explore key changes in paid work, and the division of care and household tasks , more data on  how parents experienced the changed  division of care  and household  work  is needed . Do fathers who took on greater care or household tasks during the lockdown enjoy these new roles? Do mothers  like  these new divisions, or do some feelings of discontent arise? Questions such as these become crucial for understanding the potential long-term sustainability of such improvements in gender equality."
"893" "The strength s  of our study – a representative study among Dutch parents with a high response rate, conducted in the midst of an unprecedented lockdown – outweigh these limitations. The findings here show evidence of an international trend in which inequalities along gender and class lines are worsening , although cross-national differences  and some signs of declining inequality clearly  remain .  Job losses have been exponential, but certainly not the same across countries  (17) .   Women appear to be impacted  more  by job losses in several countries, including the  Netherlands   (41) , and also in the  US, the UK, and Australia . The latter  three countries  have  historically less generous social policies in place to mitigate the consequences of being unable to work  (17,18) .  Such variation in policy schemes available to support the temporary furloughing of employees may help explain the differing effects of lockdown measures in the long run  (17,22) . With or without government support,  the  sectors in which women work have been harder hit by the lockdown  (e.g. industries such as retail, accommodation services, and food and beverage service activities)  and it is expected that these effects will be felt far into the future  (42) ."
"894" "Studies such as ours demonstrate the need to consider the societal impact of lockdown measures on parents and families. In addition, while the closure of schools and childcare centres led to greater attention to the needs of parents and families, there is clearly a  necessity  to consider the societal impact on  all  workers affected by the lockdown measures. The class effects found here extend beyond parents. Workers on temporary contracts and the self-employed faced  and continue to face  significant work and income insecurity  (14,17) . Workers in essential occupations experienced significant work pressure.   Simultaneously, social distancing requirements caused social networks to fall away for almost everyone. The impact of these measures differs across individuals, with young people experiencing much higher levels of loneliness during the lockdown than before  (14) ."
"895" "It remains unclear whether and to what extent new lockdown measures will be implemented in the coming months. If anything, the COVID-19 virus has shown itself to be highly unpredictable. The measures taken to reduce its spread will likely  mirror this situation .  Our study suggests, however, that in potential future lockdowns,  policy and research  attention should be paid to gendered and classed differences in free time and work pressure to mitigate the adverse impact on health and wellbeing of parents, especially among mothers. Should schools need to be closed during future lockdowns, greater support for parents, and more independent assignments for (younger) children, may help to mitigate the pressure parents feel when negotiating care tasks with their partner.    In short, the soci etal  impact of the lockdown measures is great . While scientific and policy attention is logically focused on the health risks associated with the COVID-19 virus, the soci etal  implications of attempts to stop its spread must not be forgotten."
