The COVID-19 pandemic continues to alter daily life and lead to changes in the way we spend
time outside. In an effort to gather timely and relevant data on national recreation patterns
before, during, and after the pandemic, the Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics and its
academic partner, Pennsylvania State University, have been working to conduct a study that
can offer guidance to land managers, recreation providers, and outdoor enthusiasts across
the United States. Phase 1 of this assessment was conducted April 9th – 11th, 2020 (Rice et al.,
2020). Phase 2 of this assessment was conducted April 30th – May 2nd. This second phase of
research—discussed in this preliminary report— was designed to provide additional
information regarding changes in recreation trends since April 9th, which provides valuable
information for managing dynamic recreational use on public lands. In total, 823 outdoor
recreationists were surveyed through the Leave No Trace community in a 48-hour window
beginning on the morning of April 30th. The results of this second rapid assessment—
complete with comparisons to Phase 1 data—will provide valuable information for managing
the changing recreation use of public lands, predicting spikes in recreation, and offering
insight for land managers as they work to protect the natural world.
The following tables, figures, and corresponding brief descriptions are intended to provide
initial results from Phase 2 of our research effort, with comparisons to Phase 1 when
appropriate. Further results are forthcoming.
Please note that not all respondents answered all questions.

Measurement items (derived from Harper et al., 2015):

...provide me with enough information to decide what actions I
should take regarding outdoor recreation during the COVID-19
pandemic.
...provide me with the best available information regarding
outdoor recreation during the COVID-19 pandemic.
...provide me with timely information regarding outdoor

Decision-making:
...make good decisions regarding outdoor
recreation management the COVID-19 pandemic.
...follow the best available science in managing
outdoor recreation during the COVID-19
pandemic.
...properly address the COVID-19 pandemic.

Respondents are slightly more trusting of state health agencies and the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) for the dissemination of information and decision-making related to outdoor
recreation during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to state and federal public land
agencies (Table 4). Respondents who perceived themselves as at no risk of illness from
COVID-19 (Table 3) were significantly less trusting of health agencies. It is important for
public agencies to incorporate CDC recommendations in their information-sharing and
decision-making.

Implement capacity limits
Use timed entries (whether through entrance gates, trailheads, etc.)
Enforce social distancing
Require visitors to wear masks
Use body temperature checks when visitors enter the premises at
high use areas

increase in expected implementation as perceived risk increases.
Items adapted from University of Florida Tourism Crisis Management Initiative (2020)

Respondents had higher levels of expectations for public land agencies’ indirect and
workforce/facility-related management strategies than direct strategies to combat COVID19. Interestingly, respondents moderately agreed that the direct management strategies of
carrying capacities and timed entry should be implemented on public lands in response to
COVID-19. Strong agreement was found for public lands agencies providing and requiring
employees to use personal protective equipment (e.g., masks and gloves), providing hand
sanitizer to visitors, increasing sanitation practices, and communication details about
increased sanitation practices. Those at higher perceived risk of illness from COVID-19 had
significantly higher expectations across direct, indirect, and workforce/facility management.

Respondents were unsupportive, on average, of opening their communities to tourists with

The Phase 1 survey (Rice et al., 2020) revealed that frequency of outdoor recreation
participation decreased slightly among the surveyed population from March 11th to April 9th.
The Phase 2 survey revealed that participation remained nearly constant from April 9th to
April 30th (Table 7). This evidence suggests that change in frequency of outdoor recreation
has largely plateaued among the population.

The Phase 1 survey revealed that nearly half of the surveyed population changed the time of
day they participate in outdoor recreation from March 11th to April 9th in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic. The Phase 2 survey revealed that the time of participation remains in
flux, as 39.1% of respondents reported a change since April 9th (Table 8). However, this
smaller change may indicate that changes in this behavior may be starting to plateau.

Phase 1 respondents decreased distance travelled to participate in outdoor recreation from
March 11th to April 9th (Table 9). Phase 2 respondents also decreased distance traveled,
however there is an inconsistency in distance reported over largely the same time period
between March 11th and April 9th (Phase 1) and the three weeks prior to April 9th (Phase 2).
Differences in average change during Phase 1 and Phase 2 are significantly different (Table
10). The significantly smaller change in distance travelled seen in Phase 2 may indicate that
changes in travel behavior are beginning to plateau.

Similar to reported changes in distance travelled to participate in outdoor recreation (Table
9), there is an inconsistency in outdoor recreation group size reported over largely the same
time period between March 11th and April 9th (Phase 1) and the three weeks prior to April 9th
(Phase 2) (Table 12). However, it is still noted that average group size decreased in both
phases. Differences in the size of changes in Phase 1 and Phase 2 are significantly different
(Table 13). Additionally, the latter period within Phase 1 not only has the smallest average
group size, but also the smallest standard deviation. The rebound in group size during Phase
2 indicates that perhaps outdoor enthusiasts are beginning to relax their social distancing
behaviors.

In parallel to Phase 1 findings, when making outdoor recreation decisions (e.g. where to go,
group size, activity), respondents rated the importance of benefits to mental and physical
health significantly more than any of the other measured factors (Tables 16 and 17).
Developed scales were grounded in relevant academic literature on psychosocial factors
influencing outdoor recreation. This includes perceptions of risk (Green et al., 2009; Reis et
al., 2012), messages from authority (Marion & Reid, 2007), social norms (Heberlein, 2012),
health benefits (Kuo, 2015), and substitution processes (Hammit et al., 2004). Reliability
analyses during Phase 1 showed all scales were appropriately reliable with Cronbach's Alpha
scores greater than 0.65 (Vaske, 2008). Furthermore, a confirmatory factor analysis
demonstrated appropriate fit with the following statistics: RMSEA=0.079; SRMR=0.0594;
CFI=0.902. Orders from authority, both from land managers as well as from state and federal
governments, were rated significantly less important than health benefits but significantly
more important than all other factors. In contrast to previous findings, perceived risk and
substitution were not significantly different from each other but were different from all other
variables (Table 18). These two factors were rated below health benefits and orders from
authority but above social norms. Social norms had the lowest scale mean and was
significantly different than all other measured psychosocial constructs. In comparing scale
means between Phase 1 and Phase 2, there was a significant reduction in scores for the
following psychosocial constructs: perceived risk, social norms, and order from authority
(Table 19).

No statistically significant difference between surveys

Likelihood to continue or return to preferred recreation behaviors/patterns when the
perceived threat of COVID-19 becomes minimal did not significantly change between Phase
1 and Phase 2 (Table 20). The majority of respondents remain extremely likely to return to
their preferred recreation behaviors and patterns.

Respondents surveyed in Phase 2 were significantly more likely to perceive changes in their
long-term outdoor recreation behaviors than those surveyed during Phase 1 (Table 21). This
indicates that as behaviors continue to be altered due to COVID-19, the likelihood of longterm changes is likely to increase in response. Of the specific behaviors included in the
surveys, travelling further to recreate and changing types of outdoor recreation were rated
significantly higher in Phase 2 (Table 22).
