Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic brought a dramatic shift in demand for spaces for safe,
physically distanced walking, bicycling, and outdoor commerce. Cities around the world
responded by instituting a variety of policies and programs meant to address this shift, such as
carving out roadway space for non-car uses, putting pedestrian walk signals on recall, reducing
speed limits, and subsidizing bike share schemes. The extraordinarily rapid pace and global scale
of these responses—and the public’s reactions to them—suggest that the transport planning,
policy, and engineering professions may be at an inflection point with respect to equitable
accommodation of non-car transport modes. In this paper we describe an effort to support
potential shifts in practice by documenting and cataloging over a thousand COVID-19-related
mobility responses into a publicly available database. We provide detailed guidance on using the
database, along with preliminary summaries of key variables in the database. We also put forth a
research agenda intended to build understanding about the processes that led to these actions,
their implications for future efforts to design and implement pedestrian and bicycle
infrastructure, and ways in which the transport professions might evolve in response to lessons
learned during and after the pandemic.

1 Introduction & motivation
Since the earliest days of the COVID-19 pandemic, cities around the world began noticing a shift
in demand for walking and cycling. This shift was driven by loss of confidence in public transit,
closings of schools and recreational facilities, an urgent need to reduce traffic injuries in order to
lessen burdens on hospital, and dramatic reductions in driving (Abdullah et al., 2020; De Vos,
2020; Mitra et al., 2020; Slater et al., 2020; Tirachini et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2020; Wilbur et
al., 2020), among other factors. In some cases, governments and public health agencies
recognized the potential of active transport as a way to lower risks of COVID-19 contagion and
boost public health (Slater et al., 2020; World Health Organization, 2020b). Cities (and later,
state and national governments) responded swiftly to these new demands by reallocating
roadway space away from motor vehicles and toward walking, bicycling, and active recreation.
The primary aim of this paper is to inspire and support efforts to evaluate the global response to
changing demands on street space during the COVID-19 pandemic. We do this by introducing an
open-source global database—the Shifting Streets COVID-19 Mobility Database—which
documents and catalogs public sector responses to COVID-19 that affect use of and access to
transportation infrastructure in over 500 cities, states, and countries around the world. We also
summarize some of the key variables contained in the database. Finally, we advance a research
agenda to build understanding about the processes that led to these actions, their implications for
future efforts to design and implement active mobility infrastructure, and ways in which the
transportation planning, policy, and engineering fields might evolve in response to lessons
learned during the pandemic.
The Shifting Streets database contains a nonrandom sample of 1,313 discrete actions taken in
direct response to changing demands for mobility in 524 cities, states or provinces, or countries
around the world. The database consolidates, harmonizes, and builds on three independent
efforts to document responses to changing mobility demands around the world, with a focus on
public sector-led actions with direct impacts on walking, cycling, and other non-car modes of
travel. Data were collected through crowdsourcing, professional networks, and systematic
internet searches during a five-month period between March 9 and August 9, 2020,
corresponding to the first five months of the World Health Organization’s pandemic declaration.
The database is housed at the University of North Carolina’s Pedestrian and Bicycle Information
Center (PBIC) and is available for public use under a Creative Commons license. It can be
accessed at pedbikeinfo.org/shiftingstreets (Combs et al., 2020).

1.1 Background
The need to react quickly to the COVID-19 pandemic changed the pace, urgency, and priority of
creating safe spaces for physically distanced walking and cycling for governments around the
world. In many regions emergency declarations gave local leaders broad powers to bypass
conventional planning processes, which may have been a necessary enabler of their responses
(e.g., COVID-19 Presidio Order June 2, 2020). As the concept of pandemic-adapted streets
diffused across the globe, the transport sector displayed a growing tolerance for experimentation,
2

rather than strict adherence to conventional—and often car-centric—engineering standards, and a
willingness to deploy infrastructure with temporary materials. Political resistance, in many cities,
was replaced with enthusiasm to ‘get on board’ with what was rapidly becoming a global
movement, often spurred by pressure from public health and active transport advocates.
The shift in demand for walking and cycling and the rapid responses by governments ushered in
a new, if temporary, era of transportation planning: where previously pedestrian and bicycle
infrastructure projects took years if not decades to plan, fund, and build, agencies were starting to
introduce temporary measures that went from inception to installation in a matter of weeks and
sometimes days. These moves have been widely praised by advocates for active, low-carbon
mobility (Haubold, 2020; Walker, 2020), and have led to the publication of at least 220 articles,
guides, webinars, surveys, and collaborative compilations focusing specifically on these
responses in transport and how to facilitate them (Pardo & Escovar, 2020). The phenomenon has
also spawned the development of a myriad platforms to track them systematically, including
Covid Mobility Works (World Economic Forum et al., 2020), the National Association of City
Transportation Officials’ COVID-19 response (National Association of City Transportation
Officials, 2020), and the European Cyclists’ Federation’s COVID-19 cycling measures tracker
(European Cyclists’ Federation, 2020).
However, the rapid changes to how street space is allocated, designed, and in some cases planned
and funded is not without controversy. Many observers and experts have pointed out that the
transportation profession’s long history of eschewing public engagement has been further
entrenched by the pandemic and the ‘emergency planning’ mentality it has engendered
(Agyeman, 2020; Butler, 2020; Lopez, 2020; Thomas, 2020). A straw poll of North American
walking and cycling advocates and professionals by AmericaWalks in May, 2020 revealed that
over half of survey participants felt their city’s changes to street space allocation in response to
COVID-19 involved no or little public consultation (AmericaWalks, 2020). Furthermore, the
Shifting Streets data indicate that the vast majority of responses (95%) were neither called for in
relevant adopted plans, nor closely aligned with on-going planning efforts (Combs et al., 2020).
Top-down decision-making and lack of robust participatory components in the planning and
implementation process has given rise to concerns over the equity of these responses, and
backlash in many cases has been vigorous. Pop-up bikeways in Berlin were taken down after a
legal dispute (Krause et al., 2020); discussions about the right to use the space by “those who
paid taxes” became very visible in the UK (Reid, 2020) and most of Latin America. In North
America, much of the controversy has focused on how access to opportunities for safe active
mobility—before and during the pandemic—is shaped by law enforcement, land use, and
housing policies that have systematically excluded racial and ethnic minorities (e.g., Badger,
2020; Barajas, 2018; Braun et al., 2019; Seay, 2020).
There are potential benefits to be realized from this more rapid, experimental approach to
providing active transport infrastructure, including shortened implementation timelines, reduced
costs, and creation of new opportunities for improved public engagement through real-time
adjustments based on feedback. There are also deleterious impacts that can arise from rushed and

3

exclusionary planning processes. By documenting and analyzing the global “COVID-19 streets”
phenomenon we hope to support research that identifies promising best practices for inclusive
processes that maximize benefits while ensuring those benefits accrue equitably.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the data collection and
validation process for the Shifting Streets COVID-19 Mobility database and serves as an
introductory user guide to the data. In Section 3 we summarize the responses recorded in the
database along several key dimensions, including what actions were taken, where, by whom, and
why. Section 4 presents a timeline of responses, showing broad trends about what kinds of
responses were gaining traction at certain points in the pandemic. Section 5 presents key
takeaways from the preliminary analysis of the data and outlines five potential research areas to
deepen understanding of the motivations, processes, impacts, and implications of COVID-19
mobility responses in the medium and longer term. We conclude by discussing limitations in the
dataset and suggests ways it can be improved through ongoing data collection and validation.

2 Methods: developing the Shifting Streets database
2.1 Data collection
Most of the responses recorded in the Shifting Streets database come from the “Local actions to
support walking and cycling” dataset. This dataset, initiated and managed by Tabitha Combs and
supported by PBIC, documents 841 actions taken by 394 cities, states, and countries between
March 10 and July 15, 2020. These data were assembled via requests for first-hand information
distributed through social media, transportation planning listservs, webinars, and word of mouth
(these crowdsourced data were entered by contributors into either a Google spreadsheet or a
Qualtrics form); data swaps with others researchers documenting pandemic-related mobility
responses on local or regional scales; and through following Google alerts and social media
hashtags for relevant key words in English, Spanish, French, and German.
The Combs/PBIC data collection efforts focused on official responses taken at the local, state, or
national level with direct implications for walking and bicycling. Data were recorded on the
dates the response was announced and implemented, the type of response, a description of the
response, whether the response was intended to be temporary or permanent, whether the
response had already been planned but implementation was accelerated due to the pandemic,
contact info and comments from the source (where provided), and web links to news articles,
city websites, and/or social media accounts providing additional information. Sources also
provided information about adjustments to transit services, provision of non-roadway space for
outdoor dining and retail, about explicit actions to restrict walking and bicycling, and about
unsanctioned ‘tactical urbanism’ actions. The Combs/PBIC dataset is archived for public use at
the Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Center (Combs, 2020).
Concurrently, Street Plans, a US-based consultancy focusing on urban transportation planning
and design, began crowdsourcing data about street-level design changes in cities around the
world. Their “COVID19 Livable Streets Response Strategies” dataset was developed to inform

4

and support on-going implementations of roadway reallocations, and data collection was largely
limited to the first two months of the pandemic. The approximately 300 actions recorded in
Street Plans’ dataset includes many of the same responses as the Combs/PBIC dataset, but adds
critical details about physical implementation, scale, and enforcement strategies.
The Covid Mobility Works website is a collaborative effort between several organizations led by
the New Urban Mobility Alliance (NUMO) and the World Economic Forum. When consulted
for this database, this website described 556 interventions, with a focus on the drivers and
motivations behind them. The Covid Mobility Works data were drawn from other data collection
efforts and from internet searches; full methods and contributor information are available with
the data at https://www.covidmobilityworks.org/ (World Economic Forum et al., 2020).

2.2 Data integration, harmonization, and validation
During July and August of 2020, the authors integrated and harmonized these three datasets into
a single database, while continuing to add new actions through August 9, 2020. Our focus was
on developing a complete, single record for each response that included all of the variables from
each of the three original datasets, constructing and populating new variables to support a wide
range of uses and research interests, and verifying all records with available information sources.
The result was the Shifting Streets COVID-19 Mobility Database.
Simultaneously, an open-source platform and corresponding GitHub repository were developed
to produce visual summaries of actions according to the categories of the database in
coordination with Datasketch, a Colombian open data initiative. This platform is available from
https://datasketch.github.io/mobility-actions/.
The Shifting Streets database documents a wide range of aspects of mobility sector responses to
COVID-19, and contains variables recording location, start and end dates, brief descriptions,
physical, spatial, and temporal dimensions, and sources of published information about each
response. Many of these variables are closely related and, in some cases, overlapping. This
overlap—wherein different variables contain many of the same or similar values—is a product of
the original datasets used to seed the Shifting Streets database. All three original datasets
cataloged a phenomenon as it was unfolding, and each original contributor documented actions
through lenses that reflected their own perspectives and interests in the phenomenon. Most of the
original variables were constructed on the fly, with values added on an ad hoc basis as each
novel form of COVID-19 response appeared. Many of the variables were text-based, without
distinct categories into which actions could be sorted an analyzed.
As we worked to integrate the datasets into a single database, we recognized a need to
standardize the information encoded in the original datasets to facilitate analysis. However, we
also wanted to maintain all the original data as it contains valuable contextual information that
may aid other researchers’ efforts to respond to different research or policy questions.

5

We achieved both aims—creating a set of standardized variables suitable for summarizing and
analyzing the COVID-19 mobility phenomenon as a whole while maintaining the valuable
contexts and perspectives of the original datasets—using the following process:
1. Assess and harmonize all entries of the separate datasets so that each response was recorded
as a single entry, as needed (example structure shown in Figure 1a). If one city undertook
more than one kind of response, they would be recorded as separate entries.
2. Merge the three original datasets into one and add a source data variable indicating which
original datasets provided information about each response. When two or more original
datasets contained similar information about a response, merge the records into a single entry
(Figure 1b, new information shown in boldface).
3. When original datasets did not include a response recorded in another dataset, populate the
missing values with available information sources (i.e., other datasets, linked information
sources; Figure 1c).
4. Generate new standardized variables for all response, populate with available information
(Figure 1d).
5. For new response implemented after data harmonization, populate all variables with available
information (Figure 1e).
Part of the harmonization process involved identifying unique individual responses. A response
is a unique combination of key characteristics describing both the response and the manner in
which it was implemented. Unique responses are recorded as individual records. For example, a
city might enact full street closures on multiple streets. If those closures began during the same
time frame and were implemented in the same manner (i.e., no differences in times/days in
effect, intended longevity of the action, its purpose, targeted modes, or selection process), they
were considered a single response and thus recorded only once. However, if some of those
streets were closed all day every day and others only on weekends, they would be recorded as
two separate responses, each with its own entry in the database.
After harmonization and integration, the entire database was validated through logical checks
within the data and consultation of original sources to fill in gaps and resolve disagreements
between original datasets. Validation efforts were focused on essential variables, described
below. As of November 1, 2020, the full integrated database included 1,313 actions documented
between March 4 and August 9, 2020. After filtering out responses that did not have direct
implications for walking, bicycling, or other non-car uses of public roadway space, lacked a
public sector lead, and or were missing data on essential variables, we were left with a sample of
1,109 documented responses taking place across 473 cities, states or provinces, and countries.
These responses include physical changes to road space (e.g., reallocation of road space to noncar modes via signage or temporary barriers), changes to transport system operation (e.g., speed
limit reductions, adjustments to traffic signal timing), changes that directly affect transport costs
borne by users (e.g., subsidization of bicycle share schemes), and regulatory changes (e.g.,
relaxation and/or tightening of restrictions on particular transport modes, dedication of funds for
emergency planning).

Table 1 defines a selection of the variables used to describe each response, including essential
variables: those which must be present for the record to be considered complete.1 Essential
variables comprise a set of characteristics that classify the response into one of 32 categories
(action), describe the location (country, state, and city, as needed, including ISO codes where
available), physical and temporal dimensions of the action (space, time, intensity), the stated
intent of the action (purpose), alignment of the response with existing policies (policy); plus an

open-ended text description of the action (description) and at least one web link to a source of
information about the action (source). Data on the essential variables come from the three source
datasets and from the news stories, press releases, and local government webpages provided in
the source variable.
Many of the variables in the Shifting Streets database are derivations of the action variable and
are linked to each other in critical yet complex ways. Understanding the relationships among
these variables will facilitate analysis and interpretations. Table 2 shows the relationships among
four of these variables: type, space, function, and application.
A note about action: each of the source datasets included a field for categorizing responses based
on their specific nature (e.g., automation of walk signals, closing of streets to motor vehicles). As
the pandemic progressed and governments began experimenting with increasingly more novel
ways to address changes in mobility demands, the action fields in each dataset evolved,
expanded, and diverged based on the interests and perspectives of the contributors. Thus, in the
merged database, action takes on 32 different but non-exclusive values that can only be fully
interpreted in concert with other variables describing specific spatial and temporal characteristics
of the responses. We needed a new variable to describe the specific nature of the responses at a
granular level but with values that were exhaustive and mutually exclusive. Thus, we constructed
application, which is derived from but different to action. The integrated database retains the
original action variable for context, but we use and recommend application for analysis.

3 Summary of COVID-19 mobility responses
We summarize COVID-19 mobility responses along a selection of essential variables and other
variables of general interest: application, region, type, function, intensity, space, policy, and
purpose. The values in these variables have all been “armchair” validated, meaning they have
been checked for logical consistency and for agreement with news stories about the responses.
We briefly describe and present summary statistics on each of these variables below. The
information presented is not meant to provide comprehensive answers, but to introduce and share
the data and to serve as an inspiration and foundation for further research on the massive,
complex phenomenon of “COVID-19 streets.”

3.1 Application
The most common application is reallocation of some but not all traffic lanes to walking and
bicycling, representing 13% of all recorded mobility responses (application=traffic lane:
pedbike). This is followed by full and partial street closures for walking and bicycling, each with
11% of all recorded mobility responses. Partial streets closures (application=partial street:
pedbike) is comprised of ‘shared’ streets (where active transport modes are prioritized and motor
vehicles slowed or discouraged through traffic calming) and ‘filtered’ streets (where use of the
affected roadway segment by motor vehicles is restricted to local traffic only). Partial street
closures are sometimes known as neighborhood greenways, bike boulevards, play streets, healthy
streets, and low traffic streets. Full street closures (application=full street: pedbike) are complete
bans of all motor vehicles except emergency, public utility, and transit vehicles in order to create
space for walking and cycling. These are sometimes referred to in English as ‘open streets’ and
Spanish as ‘ciclovía’). They are differentiated from ‘dining streets’ or ‘streateries’
(application=full street: commerce) in that their primary purpose (as described in the variable
purpose) is ‘moving people.’
Less common values of application include reallocating the outermost portion of the roadway
(application=curb space: pedbike; 5%) and on-street parking lanes (parking lane: pedbike; 2%)
to pedestrians and bicyclists, automating button-controlled walk signals (5%), adjusting traffic
signal timing to reduce wait times for pedestrians (1%), reducing motor vehicle speed limits
(3%), changing laws limiting the use of public roadway space by pedestrians and bicyclists (legal
changes; 2%), and improving existing walking and cycling infrastructure (improved existing;
<1%). Some jurisdictions sought to improve access to bicycles through expansion or
subsidization of bike share programs (7%), subsidization of bicycle purchases or repairs
(subsidize bikes; 1%), and installation and expansion of bicycle parking facilities (bike parking;
1%). Finally, a few locations established new dedicated funding streams to support construction
and maintenance of pedestrian and bicycle facilities (new funding for pedbike; 1%) and created
or revised mobility plans to accommodate COVID-19-related changes in demand for safe
walking and cycling infrastructure (new mobility plan; <1%). The database also records 56
instances (6% of responses) in which governments restricted walking and bicycling through
11

policy, enforcement, or closures of parks, trails, and other walking and bicycling infrastructure
(restrict mobility: pedbike).
Some values of application capture supports for commerce that are not directly aimed at walking
and bicycling but nevertheless affect conditions for walking and cycling. Eight percent of
responses were full street closures to create space for outdoor dining and retail, commonly
referred to as “streateries” and market streets (application=full street: commerce). Other
commerce-related responses included dedication of curb space for short term parking to facilitate

Finally, a handful of responses targeted transit and driving, with knock-on effects for walking
and cycling: improvements in transit service frequency or reliability and/or reduction or

limited transit vehicle capacities (restrict mobility: transit; 2%), and encouraging driving by

3.2 World region and jurisdiction type
Nearly all of the recorded responses (98.5%) took place in four world regions as defined by the
United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD, 2021): East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central
Asia, Latin America, and North America. South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, and
Sub-Saharan Africa make up the rest of the responses. It is likely that the small share of
responses from these regions does not accurately reflect the efforts being undertaken there; it is
more likely a reflection of language barriers and limitations of professional networks inherent in
crowdsourced data collection efforts.
The majority of responses (95.6%) took place at the city level, driven by local government
initiatives; the rest were state/region or national-level initiatives.

3.3 Type, function, and spatiotemporal characteristics of responses
We use four variables to describe the physical and operational attributes of the responses: type,
function, intensity, and space. The breakdown of these attributes is shown in Figure 2.
Type collapses application into seven general categories: full street closures, partial street
closures, curb space reallocations, reallocation of non-street space, automation of walk signals,
legal, policy, enforcement, or funding changes, and ‘other’ mobility-related strategies. The most
common type of response is curb space reallocation, in which the outermost portion of the
roadway is converted to non-car uses (type=curb space reallocation; 24% of all recorded
responses). These can be implemented either as a reduction in the width of the outermost travel
lanes (space=curb) or conversion of outer travel lanes or parking lanes (space=one or more
traffic lanes, parking lane), and can be intended for active mobility or commerce. Other physical
changes to the roadway include full street closures for active mobility or commerce (type=full
street closure; 19%) and partial street closures (partial street closure; 11%). Partial street closures
are only used for active travel and recreation; commerce is not seen in partial street closures in
13

our data, probably due to the high likelihood of conflict between motor vehicles and stationary
retail and dining infrastructure.

commerce. The remaining response types are legal, policy, enforcement, or funding changes
(13%) and other mobility-related strategies not adequately captured by any of the other
categories (25%).

The function variable is also a collapsed version of application but seeks to integrate aspects of
the apparent intended function behind the response. For example, function differentiates between
street space reallocations to support walking and cycling and street space reallocations to support
outdoor commerce but does not distinguish between the physical implementation of those
14

reallocations (i.e., full street vs. partial street vs. curb space). Function includes ten categories
plus a miscellaneous group of 36 (3%) of one-off responses that do not readily fit into the ten
functional categories.
A plurality of responses (43%) function explicitly to create street space for pedestrians and
bicyclists (expand street space for walking/cycling). Other pedestrian/bicycle supports, such as
walk signal automation, speed limit reductions, signal timing adjustments (to reduce queuing by
pedestrians at intersections), creation of new off-street recreational space, and changes to laws to
expand protections or rights to pedestrians and cyclists, comprise 12% of the responses.
Expanding access to bicycles accounts for a further 9% of responses; this value includes
subsidization of bicycle share and bicycle ownership and expansion of bicycle parking facilities.
This preponderance of responses explicitly geared toward supporting walking and cycling is not
surprising, given that the two main data collection efforts feeding into the database—PBIC and
Street Plans—were focused explicitly on local responses to changing demand for walking and
cycling.
Eleven percent of responses dedicated street space—either the entire roadway or outer travel or
parking lanes—for outdoor dining and retail (expand street space for commerce). This sort of
response also creates de facto pedestrian space; bicycles are typically permitted as well. Other
commerce supports, including dedication of non-street space (including sidewalks) and allowing
use of curb space for short-term parking for pick-up/drop-off of goods, accounts for 6% of all
responses.
Less commonly reported functions include boosting transit service (4%, comprising
improvements to service frequency and reliability and reduction or elimination of fares),
restricting transit-based mobility (2%), restricting mobility for pedestrians and bicyclists (6%),
promoting driving (3%), and influencing transport planning (2%).
Intensity is a measure of the degree to which the access to road space by motor vehicles is
affected by each response. Intensity is only applicable for actions taking place in the roadway
(i.e., where motor vehicles are normally expected to operate), which comprise 714 (64% of) all
responses. The vast majority of these responses involved completely removing motor vehicles
(intensity=100% banning of motor vehicles; emergency, utility, and transit vehicles typically
excepted) from the space (44% of all responses, 69% of applicable responses). This includes full
street closures as well as reallocation of outer lanes and curb space, even if the response does not
result in a lane reduction. Eight percent of responses (12% of applicable responses) involve bans
of either residential or other specific vehicles, as is the case with “filtered streets” (intensity=only
resident/certain vehicles allowed). Fourteen percent of all responses (21% of applicable
responses) either create shared space (i.e., ‘shared streets’; type=no ban (shared space)) or affect
walking and cycling conditions in the roadway but do not reduce the intensity of motor vehicle
traffic (type=N/A; i.e., signal timing adjustments, automation of walk signals, and speed limit
reductions).

15

Figure 3. Application of covid19 street adaptations in space

Space identifies the specific portion of the right-of-way directly affected by each response,
regardless of its function or intensity. We were able to determine and verify space for 1,076
(97%) of the responses. Of those 1,076 responses, 866 (80%) were spatially defined (i.e., took
place on a specific area of the roadway or right-of-way). Spatially defined responses most
commonly affected the entire roadway, including full and partial street closures and speed limit
reductions (space=entire roadway; 34% of all 1,076 responses), followed by one or more travel
lanes (17% of all responses), and curb space and parking lanes (both at approximately 7.5% of
all responses). Curb space actions take place at the edge of the roadway and may result in
narrowing of traffic lanes, but not their removal). Seven percent of all responses take place in
intersections (comprising mostly walk signal automation and signal timing adjustments, though
we did see a few instances of intersection reconfigurations intended to shorten pedestrian
crossing distances). Only 1% of all responses involved reallocation of sidewalk space
(space=sidewalk), nearly all of which were intended to carve out public space for outdoor
commerce, and <1.0% occurred in off-street locations (space=other). Twenty percent of
responses did not have specific spatial component. Figure 2 provides the prevalence of responses

16

by the space affected by them; the space variable and its relationship with application is further
illustrated in Figure 3.

3.4 Drivers of responses
The last variables we discuss address why (purpose) and how (policy) responses were
implemented, rather than their mechanics and physical properties. The frequencies of the various
purposes and policies recorded in the database are shown in Figure 4.

Policy
(n=1,081)

New action
Expanding pre-covid action
Fast-track pre-covid plan
Unsanctioned
Within expected pre-covid plan

Purpose (n=1.071)

Policy captures whether the responses were called for in adopted plans but not yet implemented
(fast-track pre-COVID-19 plan), consistent with ongoing programs, policies, or planning efforts
(within expected pre-COVID-19 plan), expansions of existing activities, such as extending a
weekend Open Streets event to weekdays (expand pre-COVID-19 action), or altogether new
responses decided upon and implemented outside customary planning processes (new action).
We were able to discern policy in 1,081 instances. The vast majority of responses (95% of 1,081)
appear—based on the information available to us—to be new actions. Only in a few cases were
responses expansions of pre-COVID-19 actions (2%), fast-tracking pre-COVID-19 plans (2%),
or within expected pre-COVID-19 plans (<1%). We also recorded a few instances of
unsanctioned responses (<1%), implemented by individuals or advocacy groups and not
immediately removed by local officials.

Figure 4. prevalence of COVID-19 mobility responses by policy and purpose as specified in supporting documents

Finally, purpose records the primary intended outcome or goal of each action, as described in the
supporting information sources and according to the logic defined below. Purpose can take on
the following values: public health, safety, moving people, moving goods, economic recovery,
public engagement, equity, and ‘other.’ We were able to discern purpose in 1,071 records.
Responses involving automation were always coded as purpose=public health, as they served the
purpose of reducing wait times and/or touching shared surfaces. Other responses were coded as
17

public health if the supporting information sources mentioned ‘public health’, ‘physical
distancing,’ ‘reducing crowding,’ ‘queuing,’ or ‘reducing transmission’ (or similar phrasings) in
their descriptions of the motivation for the action. Note that this means street space reallocations
for walking and cycling could be classified as ‘public health’ rather than the perhaps more
obvious ‘moving people.’ Where purposes were described as both ‘public health’ and something
else, they were coded as ‘public health.’
All commerce supports (street space, non-street space, and other supports) were coded
purpose=economic recovery (unless the ‘public health’ code applies). All responses that created
street space for walking and cycling (i.e., function=expand street space for walking/cycling) were
coded purpose=moving people unless explicitly described as something else. Responses where
function=expand access to walking and cycling were usually coded as purpose=moving people,
but in a few cases the associated information sources described responses meant to support
moving goods instead. Responses that limited mobility via transit or walking and cycling were
always coded as public health except, in the case of transit, service reductions were due to
declining revenues or demand (in which case they were coded ‘other’). Purposes for all other
responses were recorded based on the team’s interpretation of the available information sources.
The most common primary purpose reported is ‘moving people,’ (i.e., the action’s primary
purpose is facilitating movement of people via targeted mode(s)), at 47%. This is followed by
‘public health’ (29%, primary purpose is reducing disease transmission via, for example,
enabling physical distancing, automation, contactless payments) and ‘economic recovery’ (16%;
primary purpose is supporting businesses by dedicating public outdoor space to dining and
shopping, allowing businesses to operate outdoors in other spaces, or creating loading zones in
rights-of-way for short term parking for patrons’ pickup up takeaway orders). ‘Safety,’ which
includes speed limit reductions and other explicit mentions of safety, represented 5% of the
responses recorded. ‘Moving goods’ (for example, programs in Mendoza, Argentina and
Syracuse, New York that provided free cargo bike share to local businesses to facilitate delivery
of goods to consumers) took up 2% of actions. ‘Public engagement,’ ‘equity,’ and ‘other’ all
came in under 1%.

4 Timeline of COVID-19 mobility responses
Just as our collective understanding of COVID-19 has evolved over time, so have our demands
on public space and transportation systems, and on governments’ responses to those demands.
Tracking the introduction of these responses over time suggests some patterns to this evolution.
Figure 5 shows the growth over time of seven kinds of responses based on the function variable:
street space for walking and bicycling, other walking and bicycling supports, street space for
commerce, other commerce supports, access to bicycling, influence planning, and restrictions
pedestrian and bicyclist mobility.

Figure 5. Cumulative responses over time by function

Concurrent with the World Health Organization’s declaration of COVID-19 as a global
pandemic in March 2020, we see an initial flurry of mobility responses. The first response to be
popularized is ‘other commerce supports,’ which primarily took the form of creating loading
zones for picking up takeaway orders from restaurants and stores. By late March we see a rapid
rise in creation of street space for walking and bicycling (street space for ped/bike), other
pedestrian and bicycle supports, access to bikes, and restrictions on walking and cycling. “Other
19

bike/ped supports” is comprised primarily of automation of walk signals during this time period,
reflecting both the fear that surfaces were a common form of virus transmission and the
technological ease of converting actuated walk signals to automated ones. Street space
reallocations at this stage mainly occurred through the expansion of existing open streets events
in cities that already had the equipment and knowledge required to implement such actions
quickly and with minimal public resistance. The bulk of restrictions on walking and bicycling
came during this early period as well, as city officials looked to prevent crowding of public
spaces, reduce maintenance burdens on public facilities, and police movement in cities under
lockdown. These early responses appear largely to represent low hanging fruit: relatively simple,
low-cost responses cities could implement quickly.
Early April brings a levelling off of walking and bicycling restrictions and ‘other commerce
supports,’ and a slowdown in the growth of ‘other ped/bike supports’ and actions to ‘expand
access to bikes.’ Meanwhile, reallocation of street space to walking and biking begins picking up
steam, going from 23 responses to 172 in the span of a month. At this point we see the focus shift
from open streets events (i.e., full street closures) to a mix of response types including shared
and filtered streets, pop-up bike lanes, and expansions of sidewalk areas to reduce crowding
among pedestrians. April also brings efforts to reduce motor vehicle speeds to reduce the risk of
traffic injury and support safer sharing of roadway space among modes.
We see continued growth of street space for walking and bicycling into May, as well as efforts in
a handful of cities, states, and national governments to formalize and systematize pedestrian and
bicycle interventions. This includes dedication of new funding streams for pedestrian and bicycle
planning and facility construction, the first rollouts of emergency transport plans, and new
facility guidelines focused specifically on supporting and sustaining the increased demand for
active transport.
May also marks the beginning of the era of “streateries.” The number of actions to create street
space for commerce—either full street closures or opening of curb space—grows nearly ten-fold,
from five to 49, during May. Cities also began allowing local business establishments to expand
on-site operations into sidewalks and other off-street areas during this time. This coincides with
warm weather (in the northern hemisphere), relaxation of lockdowns, and pressure on
governments to ‘re-open’ economies.
The growth of all actions appears to slow by July. At this point in the pandemic, we presume
most cities that were going to act had already done so. Also, pandemic fatigue had begun to set
in and pressure to ‘get back to normal’ overwhelmed calls by public health experts to continue
social distancing. We also saw growing impatience by motorists to reclaim street space, and even
started to see the reversal of some high-profile responses, such as the court-ordered removal of
pop-up bike lanes in Berlin in early August (Krause et al., 2020).
Despite the continued rise in COVID-19 infections around the world and broad interest in
‘COVID-adapted infrastructure,’ we ended data collection in early August. Governments have
continued to expand room and provide supports for walking, cycling, recreation, and now,
20

commerce in public spaces. However, the initial waves have passed, and as of late 2020, new
actions are largely arising not through emergency responses, but as expansions and maturations
of earlier interventions and, in some cases, in response to new, post-COVID mobility plans
(Hawley et al., 2020).

5 Discussion & planning implications
5.1 Key takeaways
Cities around the world took quick action to respond to changing mobility demands. We have
recorded responses to reallocate road space and support changing mobility demands in response
to COVID-19 in 60 countries and on all continents except Antarctica. All of these responses took
place in fewer than five months; most took substantially less time. As was seen during the oil and
manufacturing shortages in World War II, the 1970s oil embargo, and several other historical
moments, crises have generated fundamental changes in society and the economy including in
the transportation sector (Pardo, 2020; Ricci, 2020). This has evidently been the case for active
transport in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. And as the pandemic has progressed, some
governments have taken steps to anticipate and plan for future disruptions (e.g., Waka Kotahi NZ
Transport Agency; Hawley et al., 2020), suggesting that they are already looking for ways to
adapt practices based on lessons learned from this event (Flyvbjerg, 2020).
There is an appetite for new methods and new solutions. Cities clearly found workarounds to
traditional barriers to implementing infrastructure and supports for walking and bicycling, and
demonstrated a newfound tolerance for experimentation and use of temporary materials.
Emergency regulation likely helped in achieving this change in many places, which may have
implications for whether the appetite for them remains after the pandemic subsides.
Public engagement was limited, and normal public processes were often sidelined. Few of the
responses involved a robust participatory component, likely due in part to urgency of the
moment, the temporary nature of the interventions, and the logistical challenges of in-person
public engagement during a pandemic. Surprisingly, only 5% of responses appear to have been
identified in existing plans or part of on-going planning efforts, meaning decisions about their
design and implementation likely occurred outside normal public processes. While our data on
public perceptions about these temporary measures is still limited (but improving), stories about
backlash abound in the media, and it is worth considering whether and to what extent lack of
public involvement has contributed to backlash. Where the public has pushed back against
changes to the transportation network, governments have responded in some cases by rolling
actions back, and in others by working with communities to better tailor the interventions to local
interests. In a few cases, governments (e.g., Emergency Transport Plan, 2020) have rolled out
plans for monitoring impacts of the interventions to inform future decisions about their ultimate
fate, consistent with existing best practices for pilot projects (Stecker et al., 2020).
The timeline of rollouts and the increasing diversity of responses raise interesting questions
about what prompted cities to act. As of the end of March, there were only a handful of
21

interventions publicized broadly enough to be captured in our database. However, the idea
caught on quickly around the world after the pandemic declaration and the World Health
Organization’s April 29th recommendation to “whenever feasible, consider riding bicycles or
walking” (World Health Organization, 2020a). New actions were being added throughout the
middle of 2020, and these actions diversified over time; the data collection teams were
continually adding new categories and reclassifying data to keep up with the increasingly
creative and diverse strategies cities were using to respond to the pandemic. The loosening
restrictions around May and thereafter may have also prompted some of the interventions.
It would be useful to know what prompted cities to act, and to what extent cities were learning
from each other. Were their actions opportunistic (i.e., were COVID-19 and its direct impacts the
catalyst for city leaders to fast-track actions they had been wanting to do anyway, even if not
called for in an adopted plan), responsive (were cities recognizing a need for creative solutions to
meet rapidly changing demands), or reactionary (were cities simply reacting to peer pressure,
advocacy, or public input)? We include two variables in the dataset—strategy and selection—
that are intended to capture these drivers of specific changes, but these questions are likely better
addressed through in-depth case studies.

5.2 The future of transport planning and policy and agenda for further research
The transport sector’s actions in 2020 point to several issues that dominated the year’s policy
actions, in addition to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of these actions were driven by growing
recognition of climate change as a crisis. Others, by the widespread awakening about systemic
injustices in how transport networks are designed, funded, used, and enforced. All of these
separate factors have potential to cause a dramatic and overdue shift in transport policy and
planning (Flyvbjerg, 2020). However, this shift depends on timely efforts to document and
deeply analyze the changes taking place in the transport realm during the year. To that end, we
have teased out what we believe to be the most fruitful and informative lines of inquiry about
responses to changing mobility demands, based on the data and information we know to be
available about the global “COVID-19 streets” phenomenon, and shape them into an actionable
agenda for further research. These lines of inquiry are presented below as five distinct research
areas, developed along five major themes: building the COVID-19 response knowledge base,
travel behavior, safer systems, equity and mobility justice, and informing practice change.
Research area 1: How did cities’ COVID-19 responses arise?
Themes: building the COVID-19 response knowledge base, informing practice change
This research area is critical for supporting further policy evaluation of COVID-19 responses. It
also informs efforts to emulate successful COVID-19 responses by identifying how institutional
cultures, regulatory frameworks, public engagement processes, and other local factors may be
associated with particular outcomes.

22

Suggested research questions:
•
•
•
•

What enabled governments to act quickly? How did cities overcome conventional barriers to
creating spaces for walking, cycling, and recreation?
Are there institutional factors, characteristics of planning culture, and/or existing mobility
demands that influence the likelihood and nature of cities’ responses?
Where did cities go for information and guidance on their COVID-19 responses?
In what ways did cities engage the public in identifying potential actions to take,
implementing those actions, and evaluating their impacts?

Research area 2: Have cities’ COVID-19 responses led to changes in travel behaviors?
Themes: travel behavior, informing practice change
A critical measure of success for a mobility investment is usage. In the case of COVID-19
mobility projects, tracking use is necessary not just for understanding whether and when to roll
back temporary measures, but also for predicting impacts of future projects. If the increased
tolerance for experimentation we have witnessed during COVID-19 outlasts the pandemic, then
it presents new opportunities for testing and evaluating potential utility of pedestrian and bicycle
investments in situ. Tracking pedestrian and bicyclist behavior during and after the pandemic
will help determine whether COVID-19 responses released latent demand for active transport,
which will have implications for traffic impact assessment and travel demand modeling and may
indicate useful changes to policies and funding structures for active travel facilities.
Suggested research questions:
•
•

•

How have cities documented changes in travel behavior?
Did cities that undertook substantial measures to support walking and cycling during the
pandemic see an increase in use by active modes, relative to other cities and compared to prepandemic travel behavior? Similarly, did streets with temporary walking and bicycling
facilities see an increase in use by active modes, relative to streets without such facilities and
compared to pre-pandemic behaviors?
Will changes in travel behavior be sustained over time, after the pandemic has subsided? In
what contexts are changes sustained (e.g., are changes associated with planning processes,
the type of responses employed, or the longevity of those responses?)

Research area 3: How were benefits from cities’ COVID-19 responses distributed?
Themes: travel behavior, safer systems, equity and mobility justice, informing practice change
Racial and ethnic minorities and residents in lower income neighborhoods have historically had
relatively poor access to safe walking and bicycling facilities and are disproportionately
represented in pedestrian and bicycle crashes, injuries, and deaths (Barajas, 2018; Barajas et al.,
2019; Braun et al., 2019). The cost of such facilities is often held up as a barrier to more
23

equitable distribution of benefits, as is the reality that minority and lower income communities
are disproportionately located along major thoroughfares and arterials, where concerns over
mitigating traffic congestion frequently take precedence over provision of walking and bicycling
infrastructure. The precipitous drop in motor vehicle traffic seen during lockdowns and the
increased acceptability of creating facilities with low-cost temporary materials should, in theory,
have enabled a more equitable spatial distribution of pedestrian and bicycle facilities. Whether
distributions of facilities were, in fact, equitable, and whether that distribution translated to
equitable benefits in terms of how facilities were used and by whom remains to be seen.
Suggested research questions:
•
•
•

How were measures distributed across cities, and were spatial distributions of new facilities
correlated with race, income, or other sociodemographic characteristics?
For what purposes were new facilities used, and by whom?
Did new facilities and programs attract new users—individuals who did not walk or cycle for
transport before the pandemic—or increase use among those who already walked and
cycled?

Research area 4: Are pedestrian and bicycle facilities implemented quickly with temporary
materials as safe or safer than conventionally deployed facilities?
Themes: safer systems, informing practice change
COVID-19 mobility responses dramatically shortened timelines for implementation of pedestrian
and bicycle facilities. In many cities, these new facilities may also represent substantial
departures from ‘tried and true’ designs planners and engineers have conventionally relied upon.
Do these new approaches a similar degree of safety (or better yet, more safety) for users than
conventional measures? If so, then how should practice evolve to take advantage of the safety
benefits of faster, broadscale implementation of lower cost facilities even beyond the pandemic?

How many crashes or near-misses have taken place on streets with rapid rollout pedestrian
and bicycle facilities during the pandemic, compared to similar streets without such
facilities?
How closely have rapid-rollout facilities conformed to best practices for safe pedestrian and
bicycle facility design?
Assuming rapid-rollout facilities were implemented on roadways that would eventually
include conventional walking and bicycling infrastructure, how many crashes, injuries, or
deaths could be avoided by more rapid implementation?

Research area 5: How has COVID-19 shaped public engagement, and how has public
engagement shaped cities’ responses to COVID-19?
Themes: equity and mobility justice, informing practice change
Transport planning has had a poor track record with respect to public engagement in many
western countries. The compressed time frame and greatly expanded scale of and spotlight on
changes to street space during the pandemic has increased awareness of this history and its
consequences. Emergency legislation has enabled many communities to forego public processes
that might otherwise shape both implementations and outcomes. However, some cities (e.g.,
Oakland, California) have been praised for developing novel approaches to reaching out to,
learning from, and working with community members to identify and trial COVID-19 responses
most likely to benefit those communities (Logan, 2020). The ways in which the public has been
both engaged and ignored during the COVID-19 pandemic likely holds clues to the longevity of
pandemic mobility responses. Careful evaluation of cities’ planning processes may uncover new
best practices that can shorten timeframes for implementation of pedestrian and bicycle facilities
without simply replicating top-down transport planning processes that have historically
dismissed the public at best, and built and maintained structures of oppression at worst.
Suggested research questions:
•
•
•

How are regulatory, public engagement, and implementation processes related to public
acceptance, longevity, and ultimate resolution of COVID-19 mobility responses?
What novel approaches did cities employ to connect with and engage with the public during
the pandemic?
Do street-level planning and/or use of experimental designs and temporary materials improve
public engagement and allow for more responsive planning processes?

5.3 Limitations
There are many limitations inherent in a database built to record a deeply complex phenomenon
via crowdsourcing during a pandemic. We present the Shifting Streets COVID-19 Mobility
database with caveats about how we believe it should be used in light of these limitations, and
suggest ways in which the impacts of these limitations can be minimized. The data collection
efforts for the three datasets upon which the Shifting Streets database was built were not
intended to be comprehensive or even to be a representative global sample. The sample is likely
to be skewed toward the US and Europe and toward actions that support walking, bicycling, and
transit use due to the interests, language skills, and professional networks of the individuals
collecting the data. As such, we do not recommend using the data to support statistical inference;
rather, we suggest using the data to support qualitative analyses, case studies, deeper dives into
processes and outcomes.
There are several steps that can be taken to improve the database and its usefulness. In addition
to recording more actions and validating existing data on the ground, tracking the “lifetime” of
25

all actions, including how long they were in place and whether (and why) they were transformed
from temporary to permanent or removed would be a useful addition that could also speak to an
additional lesson related to the potentially ephemeral nature of many of these actions. Variables
exist to capture such information, but as yet have been lightly populated. Information on public
engagement and decision-making processes would also help, although such nuanced contextual
information is often subject to challenge (and bias) and difficult to encapsulate in a large
database.
Finally, the Shifting Streets COVID-19 Mobility Database is a living document, meaning that
numbers presented here may change as records are added and validated by local experts. The
data in the database were largely crowdsourced, and while we made every effort to track down
original news articles and press releases about each response and ensure the recorded data are
consistent with those sources, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of our information for all
responses. We are attempting to contact local experts in each jurisdiction to review and validate
the data and welcome inquiries and input from anyone with professional or personal experience
with any of the responses recorded in the database. We also encourage contributions of new
information to the database from other researchers and professionals with expertise on local,
regional, or national responses to changing mobility demand during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Instructions for contacting the database team and sharing information are available on the
Shifting Streets website.

6 Conclusions
Between March 9 and August 9, 2020, over 500 cities, states, and countries adjusted the
allocation of street space and other transport resources in response to changing mobility demands
brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. The main goals of this paper are to provide an initial
descriptive assessment of this broad array of actions, and to inspire and support efforts to
understand and evaluate the impacts and implications of these actions, with a focus on responses
intended to increase opportunities for walking and cycling. We achieved these goals in two ways.
First, we introduced and described the data contained in the Shifting Streets COVID-10 Mobility
Database, a collaborative global effort to identify and document changes to the allocation of
street space and mobility resources in direct response to the pandemic. We also explained how
others in the field can contribute to ongoing collection and validation of the data.
Second, we built on preliminary observations from the Shifting Streets data to advance a
research agenda to improve understanding on the factors shaping these responses, their
implications for sustainable, equitable mobility, and the ways in which the transportation
planning, policy, and engineering fields might evolve in response to lessons learned during the
pandemic. It is our sincere hope that the data and insights provided in this paper inform and
inspire research to identify promising best practices for inclusive transport planning and
engineering processes that create more sustainable, just, and resilient mobility systems. We
acknowledge that this paper is just a first step towards understanding this overall phenomenon.
26

More work is needed to understand the evolving nature of this phenomenon and its implications
for policy and planning.
