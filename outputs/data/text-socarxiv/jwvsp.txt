Abstract
A survey experiment exposes treatment groups to four messages supporting future vaccination against COVID-19. These treatments emphasize either the risks of the virus or the
safety of vaccination, to the respondent personally or to others. For a nationally representative sample, self-reported intent to vaccinate is not significantly different from the control
for any message. However, there is a substantial divergence between white non-Hispanic
respondents, whose response to all four treatments is close to zero, and non-white or Hispanic respondents, whose intention to vaccinate is over 50% higher in response to a message
emphasizing pro-sociality and the safety of others.

Vaccine hesitancy could make this pandemic longer and worse

The COVID-19 pandemic will only end permanently when the population reaches herd immunity.
If this is to happen without hundreds of millions of deadly and dangerous infections, a vaccine
must be developed and widely used, quickly. Each person who successfully acquires immunity
from a safe and effective vaccine not only avoids their own infection but also slows community
spread of the virus.
Even if a safe and effective vaccine is discovered and tested quickly, however, a large minority of Americans may not take it, and policies to coerce vaccination may backfire. The decentralized structure and libertarian ethos of US institutions have historically caused the US to
lag peer countries in containment of epidemic disease (Troesken 2015). Anti-vaccine activists
exploit these institutions to resist immunization mandates (Reich 2018). Furthermore, even people who are ordinarily supportive of vaccination may not want the COVID-19 vaccine, if they
do not trust that its safety has been adequately tested. For example, distrust of the American
health system in general is widespread among Black Americans as a result of historical patterns
of medical exploitation, causing reduced uptake of life-saving preventive health measures (Alsan
and Wanamaker 2017).1 Furthermore, because children and young adults are at lower risk from
COVID-19, the coercive policy most widely and successfully used in the US—school vaccination
requirements—would not directly protect the most endangered groups.
Since coercive policies are unlikely to be effective, uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in the
US may depend on finding a message that will successfully persuade the vaccine-hesitant to get
their shot. The survey experiment described in this paper tests four messages for effects on respondents’ self-reported intention to vaccinate when a vaccine becomes available.
The effect of the messages varies starkly by race and ethnicity. For the complete, nationally
representative sample, no message has a statistically significant effect relative to a control group.
This is because non-Hispanic white respondents are unresponsive to all messages, with point
estimates consistently close to zero. But for non-white and Hispanic respondents, the messages
have sizable estimated treatment effects: the most effective message, one emphasizing vaccine
safety and protection of others, increases this group’s intention to vaccinate by 50.4%.
This heterogeneous treatment effect is explained by varying reasons for vaccine hesitancy.
Non-Hispanic white respondents are more likely than others to express lack of fear of the COVID19 illness, and thus less likely to see any need for a vaccine. Non-white and Hispanic/Latino respondents are more likely than non-Hispanic whites to hesitate because of fears that the COVID19 vaccine itself will be unsafe or because it will cost too much.
This heterogeneous treatment effect is important for the general public health and for equity:
1
Herd immunity may also be difficult to reach if there are many people who would be willing to vaccinate but are
deterred by other factors. For example, cost and access to health services affect vaccination rates. While many other
preventive health measures are not cost-sensitive, (Kolstad and Kowalski 2012, table 4) find that seasonal influenza
vaccine uptake is an exception. The out-of-pocket cost of any COVID-19 vaccine may therefore also affect uptake.
Also, vaccines are contraindicated for people with immune system disorders and other health risks, which means herd
immunity must arise from coverage within the remaining population.

Black, Native, and Latino Americans exhibit higher vaccine hesitancy than other groups, and have
suffered higher infection and death rates from COVID-19 (Yancy 2020; Tai et al. 2020). A messaging campaign that increases vaccine uptake in this population could therefore have important
public health benefits without any effect on non-Hispanic white uptake.

Research Design

This study uses a survey experiment to examine the effects of COVID-19 vaccine messaging on
intended uptake. Messaging has been demonstrated to effectively increase vaccine compliance
in other contexts; for example, simple differences in the ways pediatricians frame vaccination
increases compliance with the pediatric vaccine schedule (Opel et al. 2013). Historically, public
health officials have experimented with messages emphasizing the personal benefits conferred by
vaccination on oneself and one’s family, or the social duty of vaccine compliance (Colgrove 2006;
Reich 2018), but we know little about which of these was more effective. Therefore, it is an open
question whether the kind of messages that persuade parents to vaccinate their children against
now-uncommon diseases will be the most effective in the context of a deadly viral pandemic.

2.1

A two-by-two message design

Four messages are structured to emphasize the risks of the virus or the safety of the vaccine,
from the perspective of self-interest or of social responsibility. I join these two emphases and two
perspectives into four messages using a two-by-two design. The same or similar sentences are
combined across treatments to allow for clearer comparisons.2 The Risk-to-Self message emphasizes the danger the virus poses to those who are not immune:
It is important to vaccinate against COVID-19 because it is dangerous. The virus can harm
the lungs, heart, brain, and other body systems. While elderly and ill people are at extra risk,
COVID-19 is potentially deadly for anyone. Your vaccination protects you from death or
severe illness.

It is logical that people would be more interested in vaccination when the risk of disease is
higher. Previous research has shown that parents’ compliance with pediatric vaccine schedules
increases in response to local pertussis outbreaks (Oster 2018; Schaller et al. 2019). This response
is likely driven by perceptions of risk and anticipated regret, which psychologists have found
increase vaccine uptake (Brewer et al. 2017). In the specific context of COVID-19, Shoji et al.
(2020) show that knowledge of heightened local infection risk increases social distancing behavior.
Moreover, a survey experiment by Thunstrom et al. (2020) finds that risk communication increases
intention to vaccinate against COVID-19.3 A message emphasizing the respondent’s personal risk
2
The full text of the experiment is presented in appendix A2; here I provide the messages only alongside explanations of their potential effectiveness.
3
On the other hand, Akesson et al. (2020) find that perceptions of greater infectiousness of the virus lead to lower
social distancing, apparently due to fatalism about the certainty of eventual infection.

2

may therefore increase intent to vaccinate as well.
The Risk-to-Self message emphasizes the dangers posed by the virus and avoided by vaccination. The Safety-for-Self message keeps the first two sentences of Risk-to-Self but frames the
benefit of vaccination in terms of the safety it allows, not the risk it avoids:
It is important to vaccinate against COVID-19 because it is dangerous. The virus can harm
the lungs, heart, brain, and other body systems. Vaccination gives you immunity without
illness. Your vaccination can keep you healthy and safe.

This message emphasizes a positive frame on the decision to vaccinate as well as the safety of
vaccination itself. Positive and negative framing of otherwise equivalent public-goods games can
lead to very different pro-social outcomes (Andreoni 1995), including in public goods games that
explicitly model the decision to vaccinate (Sorensen 2019). Moreover, fear of adverse vaccine outcomes drives much of vaccine noncompliance, well out of proportion to the actual risks involved.
For example, negative media coverage about the safety of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine decreased uptake not only for that vaccine but for all vaccines among Danish girls (Gørtz
et al. 2020). For these reasons, a message emphasizing safety to oneself could yield a very different
response to one emphasizing risks of viral infection, even if the factual information conveyed is
little different.
Instead of focusing on risks and benefits to individuals, successful messages may want to
emphasize the prosocial role of vaccination. The benefit of a vaccine redounds partially to the
patient, who becomes immune, and partially to society, which faces lower rates of community
spread. There is reason to think that altruism is important for vaccination against a pandemic
virus—Campos-Mercade et al. (2020) show for example that a pro-social orientation predicts a person’s willingness to wear a face covering, practice social distancing, and to donate to a COVID-19
charity. On the other hand, qualitative research finds while that anti-vaccine activists understand the “free rider” dilemma of herd immunity, they dispute that they should consider this an
important reason to vaccinate their children (Reich 2018, pp. 236–238).
The Risk-to-Others message emphasizes the dangers that low population immunity poses to
other people. The first two sentences emphasize the role of immunity in preventing viral spread.
The last two sentences are almost identical to those in the Risk-to-Self treatment, but modified to
focus on the risk to other people:
It is important to vaccinate against COVID-19 because it is contagious. When a person
becomes immune, they will not spread the virus to others. While elderly and ill people are
at extra risk, COVID-19 is potentially deadly for everybody. Your vaccination protects
others from death or severe illness.

Previous research has found that information about risks to others elicits behaviors to end
the pandemic. Sjåstad and Van Bavel (2020) find that perceptions of risk to others correlate with
greater intent to perform pro-social pandemic behaviors. Also, Abel et al. (2020) find that while
providing information about the recipient’s risk to healthy young people does not affect donations
to a COVID-19 charity, information about risk to elderly people increases giving substantially.
3

Lastly, the Safety-for-Others message combines the first two sentences of the Risk-to-Others
message with a modified version of the last two sentences of the Safety-for-Self message, to deliver
a message that emphasizes the pro-social externality of vaccination, in a frame that emphasizes
keeping others safe:
It is important to vaccinate against COVID-19 because it is contagious. When a person
becomes immune, they will not spread the virus to others. Vaccination gives you immunity
without illness. Your vaccination can keep other people healthy and safe.

After viewing a randomly assigned message and expressing whether they intended to vaccinate against COVID-19, respondents were shown a follow-up question conditional on their
answer. Respondents who indicated that they planned to get the vaccine were asked how quickly
they planned to receive it.4 Respondents who did not indicate that they planned to receive the
vaccine were asked to indicate their reason for hesitancy from a checklist of possible answers.

2.2

Survey implementation

These messages were presented to a nationally representative survey panel, administered by the
Understanding America Study (UAS), a program of the Center for Economic and Social Research
at the University of Southern California. Respondents were randomized to five experimental
arms. Four treatment arms viewed one of the messages; a control group saw no message. Each
group was then asked whether they wanted the future COVID-19 vaccine. The survey identifier
was UAS-299. The research plan was approved by the USC Internal Revenue Board with identifier
UP-14-00148-AM080. Survey responses were collected from July 13 to July 21, 2020.
The UAS survey allows researchers to link anonymous respondents across survey waves. I
oversample respondents who were previously unsure whether they wanted vaccination against
COVID-19 using a question from March 2020 survey UAS-230, which asked respondents to estimate their probability of vaccinating. The sampling design set a goal of 2200 responses, with
subgroup goals of 400 respondents with self-reported March vaccine probability of 0%, 1300 respondents between 1 and 99%, and 500 respondents at 100%. UAS panel participants who did not
answer UAS-230 were not invited to the survey. Analyses were rebalanced using survey probability weights to construct a nationally representative sample.5
The UAS survey includes demographic information gathered as part of the design of the
panel, including gender, age, race, Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, educational attainment, marital status, and US citizenship. Additionally, I add a variable for political partisanship by linking respondents to survey UAS-221, which asked respondents their registered political party in January 2020.
This method identifies partisanship for all respondents except for 314 who did not participate in
UAS-221.
4

This follow-up question was motivated by worry that people who were marginal “yes” respondents might have low
urgency, which would suggest the true effect on actual uptake might be overstated. However, there is no discernible
difference in uptake urgency across treatment groups conditional on a yes answer.
5
Additional regressions presented in appendix A1, table A1 demonstrate that the findings presented below are
qualitatively the same in an equally weighted regression.

2.3

Analytical strategy

The primary analytical method is a linear probability model where the outcome is coded as 1 for
respondents who answer “yes” when asked whether they want the COVID-19 vaccine and 0 for
answers of “no” or ”maybe / I don’t know.” Treatment effects are estimated using a weighted least
squares regression of the form
Yesi = α +

4
X

γt × 1 {Treatmenti = t} + Xi β + εi

(1)

t=1

where Yesi is equal to 1 if respondent i answered “Yes” and 0 if i answered “No” or “Don’t Know /
Not Sure.” The coefficients of interest, denoted γt , are the differences in the yes-share for treatment
t relative to the control group. Xi is a vector of control variables for demographics, education,
partisanship, and March 2020 vaccine intent included in some specifications. The constant term
α equals the yes-rate for the control group in specifications without additional controls. The
residual is denoted εi .
This research design is preregistered in the American Economic Association randomized trial
registry. Its unique identifying number is: “AEARCTR-0006133.” A power analysis conducted as
part of the preregistration suggests that the sampling design will reject the no-effect null for a
true effect of 30% of a standard deviation at the 5% statistical significance level 80% of the time
after adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing.6

Data

The survey received 2,334 complete responses and 4 partial responses from 2,905 invitations, for
a response rate of 80.34%. Total usable responses were 2,336. This exceeded the target sample of
2,200 due to a better-than-expected response rate.
Table 1 presents raw counts, weighted sample proportions, and intention-to-vaccinate rates
for the sample. Average intention to vaccinate is worrisomely low, consistent with public polling
and previous research (Thunstrom et al. 2020).7 Weighting for a nationally representative sample,
just over half of respondents definitely want to vaccinate against COVID-19. Roughly 20% do not
want to vaccinate and 30% are unsure.
This represents a decline in vaccine intent since March 2020. Of people who stated that they
were 100% sure they wanted a vaccine in March, only 72% answered “yes” in this survey. At the
other extreme, just 4% of those who expressed a 0% chance of vaccination in March answered
“yes” in July.
6

This power calculation assumed that most respondents’ probability of answering “yes” would be close to their
stated probability in the March UAS survey. This is a conservative adjustment: a power calculation assuming each
respondent would be an i.i.d. draw from a binomial distribution with 2200 identical and independent draws rejects the
null more than 90% of the time for a treatment of 25% of a standard deviation.
7
A Gallup poll administered over July 20 to August 2 found 35% of Americans would refuse a free COVID-19 vaccine.
(https://news.gallup.com/poll/317018/one-three-americans-not-covid-vaccine.aspx)

Average intention to vaccinate varies widely by race and ethnicity. 75% of Asian respondents
express intention to vaccinate, but only 25% of Black respondents and 19% of Native Americans
and Alaskan Natives. Latino and Hispanic respondents had higher intention to vaccinate than
these groups (48%), but still below the sample average. This is especially alarming considering
that Black, Native, and Latino Americans have had much higher COVID-19 population mortality
than other groups. White, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and bi-/multiracial respondents were close
to the sample average, with a bit over half of each expressing intention to vaccinate.
Partisanship is correllated with intention to vaccinate. Democrats and Independents both
express intention to vaccinate at higher rates (57% and 56%) than the sample average, while 47%
of Republicans intend to get the vaccine. Minor-party members, such as registered Libertarians
and Greens, have a low intention to vaccinate (31%), although this is based on a small sample of
just 25 respondents.
Intention to vaccinate increases in education, from 35% of respondents with less than a high
school education, to 74% of respondents with graduate degrees. Intention to vaccinate by age is
lowest for people in their 30s (42%) and increasing in age thereafter, to a nearly 70% intention
among people 70 and older. Men are more likely to plan to vaccinate than women (57% versus
44%), and married people are more likely than single people (54% versus 47%). Non-US citizens
and US citizens have similar intention to vaccinate.

Experimental Results

Before proceeding to the primary analysis, I display the distribution of responses by treatment
in figure 1, panel A. The “yes” share is lowest for the control group, although the differences
between each treatment’s yes rate and the control are visibly small. The largest mean difference
is for the Safety-for-Others message, where the yes-rate is higher than the control by just over 8
percentage points. Similarly, the “no” response rate is higher in the control arm than in any of
the treatments, although again the differences are modest.8
Regressions for the full sample are reported in table 2. None of the four messages have a
statistically significant effect on the full sample. Point estimates vary somewhat: the risk-focused
messages have estimated effect on the yes-rate ranging from slightly less than zero to just under
five percentage points across specifications, while the Safety-for-Self message has an effect of four
to six percentage points, and the Safety-for-Others treatment has point estimates of seven to eight
percentage points. However, none of these effect sizes are statistically different from the control
group, nor are they of the magnitude required for rejection of the null under the preregistered
power calculations. Further, an effect of eight percentage points on a baseline vaccination rate of
8

Respondents are offered a “maybe” option to avoid a forced decision between “yes” and “no.” I think it is unlikely
that moving subjects from a “no” answer to uncertainty predicts much actual increase in vaccine uptake rates. But
table A2 in the appendix presents an alternative regression specification where the dependent variable is equal to 0 for
“no” answers, ½ for “maybe / I don’t know” and 1 for “yes.” Estimated treatment effects are little changed compared
the binary outcome regressions.

47% would not be enough to achieve herd immunity.9

4.1

Treatment effects vary substantially by race and ethnicity

While the population-level effects are not statistically significant, they conceal important heterogeneity by race and ethnicity.
I divide the sample into two subgroups: one of respondents whose race is reported as whiteonly and of no Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, and one of respondents of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity
or indicating a non-white racial identity.10 I then reestimate the weighted least squares regression
for these two subgroups. These estimates are reported in table 3.
The effects of messaging on white non-Hispanics is quite small. Four of the eight treatment
point estimates are negative, and six of the eight estimates are between +2 and -2 percentage
points. In column 2, where the addition of control variables improves the precision of the estimates, all 95% confidence intervals exclude effects larger than 10.1 percentage points.
Hispanic and non-white respondents have much larger estimated effects for three of the
treatments. The Safety-for-Self and Risk-to-Others treatments have estimated effects over 10 percentage points, although these are not consistently different from zero at the 5% significance level.
More strikingly, the Safety-for-Others message increases the share of Hispanic and nonwhite respondents who say “yes” by 19 to 22 percentage points, an estimate that is statistically different
from zero at the 5% level in both specifications, both separately and in a joint test adjusted for
multiple hypotheses.11
These differences are clearly visible if we replot the response distribution by race and ethnicity. In figure 2B, the “yes” share among non-Hispanic whites is almost indistinguishable across
treatment arms, with the possible exception of the risk-to-self treatment, where it is slightly larger.
Contrast this with the large differences in the “yes” rate by message in figure 2C, where the
Safety-for-Others share of “yes” excluding non-Hispanic whites is much larger than for the control group’s, primarily because of a much smaller share indicating that they are unsure about their
response. The proportion of Safety-for-Others respondents who intend to get the vaccine (56.1%)
is over 50% higher than in the control group (37.2%).
Regressions dividing the sample by political party, sex, and age do not reveal any notable
heterogeneity on these dimensions. These additional regressions are reported in appendix A1.
9
A commonly cited estimate of the herd immunity threshold for the United States is 70% of the population (Kwok
et al. 2020).
10
That is, respondents are placed in the second group if they are white and Hispanic/Latino, or if they identify as
both white and another race.
11
There are too few respondents assigned to each treatment arm to test effects on particular race and ethnicity groups
with precision, but means comparison suggests that this effect is not driven by the responses of just one subgroup.
The share of respondents who answer “yes” if they see the safety-for-others message, relative to the control, is 20.5%points higher for Latino and Hispanic respondents, 18.4%-points higher for Black respondents, and 31%-points higher
for Asian respondents; this compares to a difference of 1.5%-points among white, non-Hispanic respondents. The mean
difference for Native Americans and Alaska Natives is -2.8%.

4.2

People are afraid the vaccine will not be safe

If respondents did not answer that they wanted to vaccinate against COVID-19, a follow-up question asked them to indicate the reason for their answer. Six prewritten reasons for vaccine refusal
were offered, as well as space to offer a reason not listed. Respondents were allowed to choose
more than one reason of refusal.
Table 4 reports the distribution of these responses by type of refusal and by race/ethnicity.
The primary reason for vaccine hesitancy was safety concerns. Over half of the respondents who
did not choose “yes” indicated worry that the COVID-19 vaccine would not be safe, including
nearly 70% of respondents who answered “no.” This concern was lower in white, non-Hispanic
respondents (48%) than other respondents (55%).
Other important reasons for refusal or hesitancy included lack of concern about the coronavirus (21%) and worry that the vaccine would be too expensive (19%). These two reasons were
noticeably different by race and ethnicity: lack of concern was almost twice as high among white,
non-Hispanic respondents (27%) as others (14%), while cost concerns were much higher among
non-white and Hispanic respondents (24%) than among non-Hispanic whites (16%). Respondents
who were uninterested in the vaccine because of anti-vaccine sentiments generally, preexisting
health conditions, or previous COVID infection each made up less than 7% of the non-yes responses.
A substantial number of the respondents, 29% of the hesitaters, indicated that they were
hesitant for a reason not listed, and given space to write out their other reasons. Essentially
none of these written comments suggested a reason overlooked by the prewritten responses.
Instead, these responses either clarified an ambiguous response to particular prewritten answers
(e.g. medical inability to take the vaccine only if it contains certain ingredients) or offering more
detailed versions of the prewritten answers (e.g. three respondents wrote that they distrust the
vaccine specifically because of conspiracy theories around the support of Bill Gates).

Discussion and conclusion

This study has important limitations. First, self-reported intention to vaccinate may not be predictive of actual uptake decisions (Leventhal et al. 1965; Falco and Zaccagni 2020). Yet, until an
actual vaccine against COVID is available, uptake is hypothetical anyway. It is therefore prudent
to design initial messaging based on self-reported intention-to-vaccinate surveys such as this one,
and then reassess when actual uptake can be observed.
Second, the primary positive finding of this paper — that messages emphasizing the role of
vaccines in safely protecting others is effective among non-white and Hispanic populations — is a
post hoc finding.12 A follow-up experiment designed to study this population specifically should
be conducted to confirm and better understand this effect.
12

While the pre-registered analysis described in general terms an intent to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects by subgroups including race and ethnicity, gender, age, and partisanship, it left the exact implementation to be
determined depending on the ultimate characteristics of the survey sample.

8

Despite these limitations, the effectiveness of this message for this group is plausible and, if
valid, socially important. Black Americans in particular expect mistreatment and distrust claims
of safety from the US health care system; such beliefs are predictive of dangerous underuse of
health care resources (Alsan and Wanamaker 2017). Measures to persuade this group to vaccinate
are also likely to have outsize importance given that infection and death rates from COVID-19 are
much higher for Latinos, Native Americans, and Black Americans (Yancy 2020; Tai et al. 2020),
and because vaccine hesitancy is highest for these groups (table 1). Such a strategy could potentially complement a “precision public health strategy” that implements targeted interventions for
greater overall effectiveness (Rasmussen et al. 2020).
Messaging aside, this study has also shown that people of color disproportionately hesitate
to vaccinate against COVID-19 because of concerns about vaccine safety and affordable access
(table 4). Both of these reasons can be addressed with good public policy. Given the ongoing
economic turmoil the pandemic has caused, programs to subsidize and widely distribute vaccine
doses to willing but price-sensitive groups are likely to pass a cost-benefit analysis easily. And
transparent safety testing of candidate vaccines, and effective messaging of that safety and the
role of vaccines in protecting families and communities, is likely to be critical for encouraging the
broadest possible uptake and protecting as many people as possible, particularly people of color.

Each column reports a linear probability model regressing whether a respondent
answered “Yes” regarding intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 (coded 1) or
chose “No” or “Don’t Know / Unsure” (coded 0). Demographic controls include
sex, age, race, ethnicity, political partisanship, US citizenship, marriage, and education. Vaccine intent controls include the self-reported probability of vaccination
as of March 2020 in a prior wave of the UAS survey, included as both a continuous
variable and with indicators for probabilities equal to 0 or 1. A reported p-value at
the bottom of the table is for a joint F-test that any of the four treatment variables
are significantly different from zero. All regressions are weighted using survey
probability weights.

they wanted to vaccinate against COVID-19. Respondents were permitted to indicate more than one reason and totals
sum to more than 100 percent. Respondent shares are reported separately and pooled for the 598 “no” responses and
715 “Maybe / I don’t know” responses. Proportions are weighted averages using survey weights.

This short survey will ask about your plans to vaccinate against the coronavirus that causes the
COVID-19 illness. Right now, there is no vaccine against the coronavirus. However, one may be
available in the coming months.
Do you want to get the COVID-19 vaccine?
○ Yes
○ No
○ Maybe / I Don’t Know

About the COVID-19 Vaccine
This short survey will ask about your plans to vaccinate against the coronavirus that causes the
COVID-19 illness. Right now, there is no vaccine against the coronavirus. However, one may be
available in the coming months.
The following is a potential message to promote the vaccine when it becomes available:
It is important to vaccinate against COVID-19 because it is dangerous. The
virus can harm the lungs, heart, brain, and other body systems. While elderly
and ill people are at extra risk, COVID-19 is potentially deadly for anyone.
Your vaccination protects you from death or severe illness.
Please read the message above carefully before answering the survey.
Do you want to get the COVID-19 vaccine?
○ Yes
○ No
○ Maybe / I Don’t Know
Choose One. If “Yes,” go to question 2. If “No” or “Maybe / I Don’t Know,” go to question 3.

available in the coming months.
The following is a potential message to promote the vaccine when it becomes available:
It is important to vaccinate against COVID-19 because it is dangerous. The
virus can harm the lungs, heart, brain, and other body systems. Vaccination gives you immunity without illness. Your vaccination can keep you

About the COVID-19 Vaccine
This short survey will ask about your plans to vaccinate against the coronavirus that causes the
COVID-19 illness. Right now, there is no vaccine against the coronavirus. However, one may be
available in the coming months.
The following is a potential message to promote the vaccine when it becomes available:
It is important to vaccinate against COVID-19 because it is contagious. When
a person becomes immune, they will not spread the virus to others. While elderly and ill people are at extra risk, COVID-19 is potentially deadly for everybody. Your vaccination protects others from death or severe illness.
Please read the message above carefully before answering the survey.
