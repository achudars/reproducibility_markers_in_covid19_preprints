Abstract
Neighborhoods and neighbors are important sources for people’s life chances and
well-being. Their importance is highlighted in times of crisis, such as the COVID-19
pandemic: Neighbors helped vulnerable and at-risk groups by providing small services
and a sense of community. Using panel data from Switzerland, this study investigated
how and for whom relations with neighbors changed to the better or worse during the
pandemic. In a second step, changes in subjective well-being and trust in other people,
both of which dropped considerably during the pandemic and social confinement, were
linked to changes in neighborly relations. The results show that the negative impact of
the pandemic on people’s subjective well-being and trust was much less pronounced for
those who improved their relations with neighbors during the pandemic. At the same
time, those with more resources prior to the pandemic were more likely to improve
neighborly relations. Consequently, this study finds evidence for a social gradient in
subjective well-being and trust during the crisis that partly works through changes in
neighborhood networks. Robustness analyses further show that the documented effects
are indeed attributable to changes induced by the COVID-19 pandemic and the
corresponding social confinement measures.

Introduction

1

Neighbors are an important source of everyday help and support [1–3]. More generally,

2

neighbors and neighborhoods are crucially associated with people’s well-being [4, 5].

3

While much research has focused on neighborhood effects on objective measures of

4

well-being, such as educational chances, labor market outcomes, or physical health [5–8],

5

researchers increasingly investigate the effects of neighborhood environments and

6

networks on people’s subjective well-being [9–12]. Following Diener [13], subjective

7

well-being comprises an overall assessment of one’s satisfaction with life as well as of

8

pleasant and unpleasant experiences (positive and negative affect). Given its association

9

with people’s physical and mental health status [12, 14, 15], subjective well-being can

May 18, 2021

2/35

10

also be considered an additional path through which neighborhoods and neighbors affect

11

individual life chances.

12

Several mechanisms have been suggested of how neighborhoods and neighbors

13

influence subjective well-being [16]. On the one hand, existing research suggests effects

14

of the residential environment, such as the share of public green spaces, neighborhood

15

density, or the accessibility of transport and shopping opportunities [11, 17, 18].

16

Meanwhile, rather than a direct effect, such physical neighborhood characteristics affect

17

subjective well-being through residents’ perception of their local surroundings [12, 14, 18].

18

On the other hand, neighborhood composition, for example with regard to income, and

19

especially neighborhood social capital and networks are put forward as mechanisms that

20

relate individual well-being with the residential environment. Regarding neighborhood

21

composition, neighbors with similar characteristics (education, income, ethnic origin)

22

are associated with increases in subjective well-being, although this positive effect is

23

only found for geographically small neighborhoods [19–21].

24

Finally, neighborhood influences on subjective well-being also work through localized
social capital and neighborhood networks: In addition to the influence of individual

26

resources, psychological traits, and one’s social network in other domains (friends,

27

work), subjective measures of neighborhood relations, neighborhood social capital, and

28

social cohesion increase people’s subjective well-being [10, 22–24]. In this regard,

29

Greenfield and Reyes [25] highlight that especially changes in the relation with one’s

30

neighbors are associated with individual well-being. This finding is then also in line

31

with research on subjective well-being more generally that stresses the influence of

32

perceived changes and the importance of reference points [13].

33

A related branch of research more generally looks at the formation of social capital

34

and social cohesion in the local context [26–28]. In interactions with neighbors, people

35

develop a sense of community, which supports the formation of trust at the local as well

36

as the wider, societal level [29–31]. Consequently, changes in neighborly relations and

37

neighboring not only affect subjective well-being but also other domains of life such as

38

trust in other people.

39

The importance of neighborhood social capital and neighborhood social networks is

May 18, 2021

25

40

emphasized in times of crisis: Neighbors provide shelter and help during natural

41

disasters [32–34], and they provide support to people suffering from mental

42

3/35

distress [35, 36]. This last point is then also highlighted by the increase in neighborhood

43

help during the COVID-19 pandemic [36, 37]. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic and

44

the measures to combat its spread have had a significant effect on people’s subjective

45

well-being and can undermine social cohesion and trust [38–41]. Against this

46

background, the present contribution asks to what extent neighborhood relations

47

changed in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and whether neighborhood networks

48

provided a buffer against the negative effects on subjective well-being.

49

More specifically, the present contribution pursues two goals: First, it examines how
neighborhood relations changed during the pandemic in different residential contexts

51

and how these changes vary for different social groups. Second, it relates these changes

52

to changes in subjective well-being and generalized trust. Can neighbors buffer the

53

negative effects of the pandemic? Focusing on subjective well-being on the one and

54

generalized trust on the other hand not only follows from the outlined crucial role of

55

localized social capital [26, 42, 43], but it also allows for an assessment of both individual

56

(well-being) and societal consequences (trust) of neighborhood relations in times of crisis

57

and increased strain.

58

Based on the outlined state of the art, the following hypotheses are proposed. First,

May 18, 2021

50

59

regarding the change in neighborhood networks, we expect that those who already have

60

had a larger neighborhood network prior to the crisis, regarding contact and the

61

exchange of mutual support and instrumental help, to report an improvement of their

62

relationship with neighbors during the pandemic. This can be attributed to several

63

factors. On the one hand, people who already have had a larger neighborhood network

64

prior to the pandemic are likely more strongly involved in neighborhood-based coping

65

strategies with the consequences of the pandemic, such as going shopping for their

66

at-risk neighbors. In this regard, elderly people were not only especially affected by the

67

COVID-19 pandemic and the measures to contain it [44, 45], but they are usually also

68

more attached to their neighborhood, have larger neighborhood networks, and they

69

mobilize more support from neighbors [24, 46–48]. On the other hand, although people

70

with less resources are reported to benefit most from neighborhood networks [46],

71

people with more advantageous endowments (e.g., higher educational qualifications)

72

usually have larger networks and mobilize more support through these networks [49, 50].

73

At the same time, given their relative advantage in terms of resources, they are also able

74

4/35

to provide more support to neighbors in times of crisis which can improve the

75

relationship with their neighbors.

76

Second, since locally organized instrumental and also emotional support were

77

especially important during the pandemic and social confinement [25, 36, 46, 51, 52], we

78

expect that the changes in one’s neighborhood network during that period are largely

79

independent from the size and amount of interaction prior to the pandemic in other

80

social networks, such as friends, colleagues, or online networks. Thus, while those with a

81

larger neighborhood network are expected to have improved their relation with

82

neighbors in that time, a larger network of friends and colleagues should have played

83

only a minor role.

84

Third, based on existing research [38, 40, 44, 45], a decline in people’s reported

85

subjective well-being and their generalized trust in other people due to the pandemic

86

can be expected. This average trend, however, will likely differ with individually

87

available resources to cope with the crisis. Moreover, an increase in neighboring

88

activities, solidarity, and social capital in the neighborhood strengthens community

89

resilience [12, 33, 34]. Since the formation of trust takes place in people’s immediate

90

circle of friends, family, and neighbors, an increase in neighboring activities during the

91

pandemic likely fosters trust [30]. Consequently, those who improved their relation with

92

neighbors in the course of the pandemic are expected to show a smaller decline in

93

generalized trust and subjective well-being. In other words, a COVID-19-induced

94

increase in neighboring, understood as the exchange of social and instrumental

95

support [10, 50], should buffer the negative effects of the pandemic on people’s

96

generalized trust and subjective well-being.

97

Consequently, the contribution of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, it provides
a unique and first assessment of how neighborhood relations changed in times of crisis

May 18, 2021

98

99

and how localized networks mediate the negative effects of social confinement and

100

isolation. Second, it more generally contributes to the literature on neighborhood effects

101

which is still predominantly concerned with objective measures of people’s well-being,

102

such as neighborhood effects on income, education, or physical health [4, 53–55].

103

Focusing on subjective measures of well-being not only broadens our understanding of

104

neighborhood effects on people’s lives but, given the documented effects of subjective

105

well-being and trust on, for example, labor market outcomes or health [56], also adds an

106

5/35

May 18, 2021

additional path through which the neighborhood environment and networks affect

107

objective measures of well-being.

108

Materials and methods

109

Data

110

To test the outlined hypotheses, this study uses data from the Swiss Household Panel

111

(SHP; [57]). The SHP is a representative annual, longitudinal study comprising

112

somewhat more than 7’000 households. All members of the household aged 14 or older

113

are eligible for participation, resulting in about 12’000 interviews. While data is usually

114

collected at the end of each calendar year using a mixed mode design (computer assisted

115

telephone, personal, or web interviewing), an additional data collection took place

116

between 12th of May and June 26th 2020, right after the end of the first lockdown in

117

Switzerland [58]. 67% of all invited respondents from the previous wave (2019)

118

completed a short 15 minutes, self-administered survey, either on paper or online, which

119

corresponds to 5’843 people from 4’053 households.

120

Compared to standard waves of the SHP, the COVID-19 questionnaire was

121

considerably shorter. It mainly focused on the effects of the pandemic on people’s

122

economic and social life as well as the prevalence of COVID-19 in their social network.

123

Nevertheless, there are several variables that allow for a direct comparison with previous

124

waves, namely people’s subjective well-being, generalized trust, and changes in their

125

neighborhood network. To make use of the longitudinal structure of the SHP, this study

126

uses data from the COVID-19 survey and the previous wave of data collected by the

127

end of 2019 (wave 21). Restricting the sample to adults and omitting cases with missing

128

values on any of the included variables resulted in 4’530 and 4’276 cases for the models

129

concerned with subjective well-being and trust, respectively. Respondents in the final

130

sample are between 18 and 99 years old, about one third holds a tertiary degree, and

131

about one in 20 households moved since the last wave of data collection. Additional

132

information about the sample and descriptive statistics for all the variables in the

133

models can be found in Table S1.

Measures

135

COVID-19 has had a considerable effect on people’s well-being – both objectively in

136

terms of living conditions as well as subjectively in terms of life satisfaction, positive

137

and negative affect [38, 39, 44, 45]. Likewise, home confinement and the pandemic more

138

generally have had an effect on people’s generalized trust [40, 41, 59]. Consequently, this

139

study looks at the two following outcome measures: First, subjective well-being is

140

assessed by people’s rating of the overall satisfaction with life on an 11 point scale [60].

141

Second, trust is measured by means of their subjective assessment of whether you

142

cannot be too careful in your encounters with people or whether most people can be

143

trusted on an 11 point scale [61]. Fig 1 shows the average satisfaction with life and

144

generalized trust in the years prior to the pandemic (2016–2019) and right after easing

145

the lockdown measures in 2020. While there is, on average, only a small drop in

146

people’s satisfaction with life after the end of the 41 days of lockdown in Switzerland,

147

their generalized trust decreased considerably.

148

Of primary interest is whether changes in the two outcome measures, subjective

149

well-being and generalized trust, are associated with changes in people’s neighborhood

150

network and neighboring behavior. Social networks of respondents in the panel are

151

collected only every third year, the last time at the end of 2019. The COVID-19

152

questionnaire, however, asked to what extent respondents’ relation with their neighbors

153

changed since the start of the pandemic. On the 11 point scale, about two thirds chose

154

7/35

the middling category, indicating no change, while the rest reported either a

155

deterioration or an improvement in the relations with their neighbors. Other social

156

network measures were not part of the COVID-19 questionnaire. From the previous

157

wave, however, information about the size of people’s friendship, neighborhood, and

158

online social networks is included. Given their left-skewed distributions, these variables

159

were log-transformed in the final analyses. Likewise, information on their family

160

network is included, namely whether they have a partner and/or children. All other

161

measures, if not explicitly stated otherwise, were collected in spring/summer 2020, that

162

is, after the lockdown was lifted.

163

Given the impact of social confinement on vulnerable groups, people’s self-reported
health on a five point scale is included. Also based on self reports, an additional

165

indicator captures whether respondents or somebody in their household, or somebody

166

they know personally, were tested positive for COVID-19. In the same vein, people’s age

167

is included linearly as well as a quadratic term to account for the fact that the elderly

168

were more affected by the pandemic and that they usually also rely more on locally

169

organized support, such as instrumental help from neighbors [45, 50].

170

Additionally, all models include covariates to account for people’s socioeconomic

171

situation. To this end, their occupational status was included, differentiating between

172

people who are employed, self-employed, or economically inactive (in education, retiree,

173

unemployed, housekeeper). Moreover, their highest education is controlled for and

174

distinguishes between people who completed at most compulsory schooling (up to

175

ISCED 2), upper secondary, non-tertiary education (ISCED 3 & 4), and tertiary

176

education (ISCED 5 - 8). Finally, all models account for the financial situation of the

177

households in the sample, differentiating between those who can save money, those who

178

just get by, and those who get into debt.

179

Neighborhood networks need time to evolve. Consequently, all models control for

May 18, 2021

164

180

prior residential mobility. Moreover, neighborhood effect studies often focus on urban

181

areas. Existing research [10, 19], however, stresses that the average subjective well-being

182

is usually higher in rural areas and small towns. Likewise, neighboring likely also differs

183

among urban, suburban, and rural areas. This is why the community type is controlled

184

for in all analyses. Moreover, since studies have also suggested differences according to

185

people’s gender and ethnic background [9, 17, 62], all models control for respondents’

186

8/35

gender and the duration of residence in Switzerland. Moreover, an indicator for

187

neighborhood vandalism in 2019 is included to account for differences in neighboring

188

according to perceived neighborhood disorder. When modeling generalized trust,

189

people’s self-rated religiosity and their civic engagement in form of voluntary work are

190

also included, since both have been found to be important determinants of trust and

191

social cohesion [42, 63]. Descriptive statistics of all measures used in the analyses can be

192

found in Table S1 in the appendix.

193

Methodological Approach

194

Given the aim of this study of examining how neighborhood networks and relations

195

changed during the pandemic, and how this in turn affected people’s subjective

196

well-being and trust, the analyses proceed in two steps. First, it is evaluated whose

197

neighborhood relations changed to the better or worse, allowing us an assessment of

198

how different groups of people have found or lacked support during the crisis in their

199

local environment. Second, the analyses proceed to examine the extent to which these

200

changes in neighboring and neighborhood relations buffer the negative impacts of social

201

confinement and the pandemic on subjective well-being and generalized trust.

202

Although the underlying data is longitudinal in nature, some measures, namely the

203

one concerned with social relationships in the neighborhood, were collected as perceived

204

changes compared to the last wave, rather than as absolute values on the same scale.

205

This then asks for an analytical strategy that relates these perceived changes to the

206

repeated measurement of other covariates, making the most of the underlying

207

longitudinal data. Change score analysis is a framework that enables an integration of

208

these two perspectives [64, 65]. That is, for the first analytical step, we estimate the

209

equation

210

δY = Xβ + ε,

May 18, 2021

(1)

where δY is a vector of the perceived difference in neighborhood relations during the

211

pandemic and X is a n × p matrix of observed covariates with β the corresponding

212

p × 1 coefficient vector. It is important to note, however, that δY reflects respondent’s

213

self-assessed difference of how the relation with their neighbors changed during the

214

9/35

pandemic rather than the difference of the same measure at two time points (i.e.,

215

Yt − Yt−1 ). Although calculating the difference by subtracting subsequent scores of the

216

same variable is not free from (random) error, using a self-reported measure of change

217

additionally does not come with the advantage of a true change score, namely

218

controlling for unobserved heterogeneity by means of differing out the effects of

219

time-constant unobserved influences [65]. Consequently, the results should only be seen

220

as a description of whose neighborhood relations changed to the better or worse during

221

the pandemic. Since it is possible that a covariate is associated with both a

222

deterioration as well as an improvement in neighborly relation, rather than using the

223

original 11 point linear scale, change in neighboring is analyzed as a categorical variable,

224

differentiating between relations that deteriorated, stayed the same, or improved in the

225

course of the pandemic. To this end, multinomial logit models are used and average

226

marginal effects are reported to ease the interpretation of the effects.

227

In the second step of analysis, the longitudinal nature of the data is used more

228

directly: people’s satisfaction with life as an indicator for subjective well-being and their

229

generalized trust are measured in the interim COVID-19 questionnaire using the same

230

items as in pre-COVID-19 waves. However, since the key independent variable, the

231

change in relations with neighbors, is directly measured as respondents’ perception of

232

how the relation with their neighbors changed during the pandemic, random or fixed

233

effects models are not an option. Thus, we are forced to either follow a change score

234

approach as the one outlined in equation (1) or a lagged dependent variable strategy.

235

While some have argued in favor of the robustness of a change score strategy [64, 66],

236

Morgan and Winship caution against such premature conclusion [65]. They highlight

237

that the choice between the two approaches follows from the underlying assumption

238

about the evolution of the counterfactual outcome in the treatment and control group:

239

While a change score approach assumes a constant difference, k, between the treated

240

and controls in the absence of the treatment, that is,

241

0
0
E[Yit−1
|Di = 1] − E[Yit−1
|Di = 0] = k = E[Yit0 |Di = 1] − E[Yit0 |Di = 0],

(2)

the lagged dependent variable approach, in which the outcome at time t is regressed on

May 18, 2021

10/35

242

the outcome at time t − 1 and the covariates, i.e.,

243

Y t = δY t−1 + Xβ + ε,

(3)

assumes that, in the absence of the treatment, the difference between the groups shrinks

244

by a multiplicative factor, r,

245

E[Yit−1

E[Yit0 |Di

E[Yit0 |Di

and that

246

lim E[Yit0 |Di = 1] = E[Yit0 |Di = 0].

(5)

t→∞

May 18, 2021

Given the general importance of neighborhood relations for subjective well-being and

247

the formation of trust in the local context [10, 12, 20, 26–28], there is no reason to

248

assume that trust and subjective well-being would be the same for people whose

249

relation deteriorated and for those whose relations improved if there were no pandemic.

250

However, using panel data from previous waves allows us to test this assumption more

251

explicitly using a placebo regression approach. To this end, the models will be

252

re-estimated using the changes between 2016 and 2019, allowing us an assessment of

253

whether the results can truly be attributed to the endogenously induced changes by

254

COVID-19. Moreover, the two stages of analysis make it explicit that the main

255

covariate of interest, the change in relations with neighbors, is endogenous. Thus, we

256

also need to test for potential endogeneity problems [67] in the second step of analysis.

257

Results

258

Changing neighborhood relations in the pandemic

259

How did people’s neighborhood networks and forms of neighboring change during to the

260

pandemic? Fig 2 differentiates between respondents whose relation with their neighbors

261

deteriorated, improved or stayed the same as during the pandemic. While it is apparent

262

that for most people their relations with neighbors did not change, about one in five

263

persons states that their relation improved in that time. Unsurprisingly, those who

declared that they had no contact to neighbors and those who did not receive any

265

support from neighbors prior to the pandemic almost never reported that their relations

266

deteriorated in the course of the pandemic (first stacked bar in Fig 2a and Fig 2b). On

267

the other hand, those who had had a larger network of neighbors right before the onset

268

of the COVID-19 pandemic are more likely to have experienced an increase in their

269

neighborly relations. This pattern is even more pronounced if one looks at the amount

270

of instrumental support received from neighbors prior to the pandemic (Fig 2b).

271

However, this pattern likely also reflects that people who received more instrumental

272

support prior to the crisis are those who are more affected by the pandemic and social

273

confinement, such as the elderly.

274

The differences in the change of neighborly relations might, however, barely reflect

275

unequal resources and opportunities for interactions with one’s neighbors. For a more

276

complete picture of whose relationship with neighbors changed during the pandemic,

277

Table 1 presents the results of a multinomial logit model. The effects are presented as

278

average marginal effects (AME) for all three outcomes of change in one’s neighborhood

279

network. Since the quality of ties has been shown to be more important than the

280

quantity of ties [22], the instrumental support from neighbors and the frequency of

281

contact with friends rather than the corresponding network sizes are included. For

282

respondents’ online social network, however, the number of ties is the only information

283

available.

284

Categorizing the originally 11-point scale into three distinct categories of change in

285

neighborly relations proofs to be the adequate strategy: Some measures are associated

286

with both a deterioration as well as an improvement of relations. Starting at the top of

287

12/35

May 18, 2021

Table 1, compared to those who hadn’t received any instrumental help from their

288

neighbors prior to the pandemic, the probability for an improvement of neighborly

289

relations is 10 percentage points higher for those with a lot of support from their

290

neighbors prior to the onset of the COVID-19 crisis. Likewise, those who indicated

291

moderate support from neighbors are 8.5 percentage points more likely to report an

292

improvement in their relations but also 1.4 percentage points more likely to report a

293

deterioration. Finally, compared to those who received no support from their neighbors

294

prior to the pandemic, people who received little support have a 3 percentage points

295

higher probability to report a deterioration of their neighborly relations. Once the

296

neighborhood network is accounted for, the effects of other social networks are almost

297

absent. Respondents who had weekly contact with their friends prior to the pandemic

298

are found to have a 7.6 percentage higher likelihood to improve the relation with their

299

neighbors than those who had no contact with their friends. Likewise, those who

300

reported a larger online social network in the last wave prior to the pandemic are also

301

more likely to report an improvement of neighboring during the COVID-19 crisis.

302

Regarding people’s self reported health, those in better health are less likely to

303

report that the relations with their neighbors deteriorated (by 1.3 percentage points).

304

Likewise, compared to respondents who do not know anybody with a positive

305

COVID-19 test result, people who went through a COVID-19 infection themselves or

306

with friends that were tested positive are less likely to report no change in their

307

neighborhood network (by 10.5 and 6.5 percentage points, respectively). Changes in

308

neighborly relations are also related to the resources people posses: If respondents are in

309

a tight financial situation, the likelihood that the relation with their neighbors

310

deteriorated is 2.6 percentage points higher compared to households in a financially

311

relaxed situation. At the same time, although only marginally significant at the 10%

312

level, poorer households also seem to be more likely to improve relations with their

313

neighbors. This might also reflect greater needs for help and support in their immediate

314

surroundings in times of crisis. Meanwhile, the association with education is

315

uni-dimensional: The higher respondents’ education, the more likely they are to improve

316

their neighborhood relations during the pandemic. While the probability for improving

317

relationships is 7.7 percentage points higher for those with upper secondary schooling,

318

such as an apprenticeship, those with tertiary degrees, for example, from a university,

compared to people in urban centers, respondents in other regional structures are more

324

likely to report no change in their relation with neighbors and they are less likely to

325

report a deterioration or an improvement in neighborly relations. Thus, it seems that

326

people living in urban centers experienced overall more change in their neighborhood

327

relations during the pandemic, both to the better and the worse, than did people in

328

other regions. All these effects are additionally controlled for age, age2 , partnership

329

status, presence of children, occupational status, and residential mobility.

330

Neighborhood relations, subjective well-being and trust in times

331

of crisis

332

We now move on to examine how changes in neighborly relations during the pandemic

333

are associated with individual subjective well-being and trust in others. In this regard,

334

we expected that an increase in neighboring behavior during the crisis enhances

335

individual and collective resilience, therewith buffering the negative effects of social

336

isolation and confinement. Table 2 depicts the results, using the change scores in

337

self-reported satisfaction with life and trust in others as dependent variables.

338

The first column of Table 2 gives the results for the change in people’s reported

339

satisfaction with life as one essential component of subjective well-being [13]. Positive

340

coefficients imply a higher change score, that is, an improvement (or rather less

341

deterioration – see Fig 3) of people’s subjective well-being right after the end of the first

342

lockdown in Switzerland compared to the pre-COVID-19 survey at the end of 2019.

343

Regarding the research question at hand, we note that those who report a more positive

344

change in the relation with their neighbors during the pandemic also experienced a

345

more positive change in their subjective well-being. However, this effect is non-linear

346

and inversely U-shaped, indicated by the significant, negative quadratic term. People

347

who improved their relations with neighbors a lot during the pandemic experienced only

348

a very small decline in subjective well-being compared to the pre-COVID-19 time (left

panel of Fig 3a). This effect is independent of other networks, namely the logarithmic

350

size of respondents’ neighborhood, friendship, and online social network, which, however,

351

have been found to influence the change in neighborly relations in Table 1.

352

Unsurprisingly, those in better self-reported health are more likely to experience a
more positive (or less negative) change in subjective well-being during the pandemic.

354

Also, the more days have passed between the end of the lockdown and the survey

355

interview, the more positive (or less negative) the change in subjective well-being. The

356

rest of the control variables have only a subordinate or no influence. At the 5%

357

significance level, there is no negative effect on the change in subjective well-being if

358

respondents or somebody in their close network went through a COVID-19 infection.

359

Those with more financial difficulties, however, are more likely to report more positive

360

changes in their life satisfaction. This might, however, merely reflect that they had lover

361

levels of satisfaction to begin with (floor effect). Compared to men, women seem to

362

experience less positive or, in other words, more negative changes in their life

363

satisfaction in the course of the pandemic. Meanwhile, there is almost no difference in

364

the change in life satisfaction among different regional structures. Compared to people

365

living in urban centers, those in industrial and tertiary sector communes are found to

366

have lower change scores, that is, they experience a more pronounced decline in life

367

satisfaction. For the rest of the control variables, especially those who are not in paid

368

labor report more negative changes (not reported).

369

Turning to the second column of Table 2, we observe a similar pattern for the change

May 18, 2021

353

17/35

370

in generalized trust during the pandemic. Again, those who report an improvement in

371

neighborly relations during the pandemic have a more positive change score, indicating

372

that the negative impact on trust of the pandemic (see Fig 3b) was less pronounced for

373

this group of people. Unlike in the case of people’s subjective well-being, this effect

374

appears to be linear, indicated by the insignificant effect for the quadratic term. From

375

the right panel of Fig 3, we infer that people who improved their relations with

376

neighbors a lot during the pandemic report only a small decline in trust compared to

377

pre-COVID-19 times. While most of the other network measures again show no

378

significant association with the change in trust, those with a larger neighborhood

379

network prior to the pandemic are somewhat more likely to have a more negative and

380

less positive change score.

381

Indicated by the insignificant effect of the days since the end of the first lockdown,

May 18, 2021

382

the negative impact of the pandemic and the corresponding confinement measures

383

seems to be longer lasting in the case of generalized trust than in the case of subjective

384

well-being. There is no effect of having went through a COVID-19 infection oneself or of

385

knowing someone with a positive test result in one’s close social network. Compared to

386

households who can save money, those in a tighter financial situation are somewhat

387

more likely to report more positive and less negative change. This again likely reflects

388

the aforementioned floor effect for those with less resources. In contrast to the change in

389

subjective well-being, the change in people’s trust is uniform between men and women

390

as well as among regions. Since the literature on social capital and trust also highlights

391

the importance of civic engagement and religiosity [42], the change in generalized trust

392

during the pandemic is also regressed on an indicator for voluntary work and people’s

393

feeling of religiosity. Of the two measures, only the latter is significant: More religious

394

people experienced more positive changes in generalized trust. Given that, on average,

395

there was a significant drop in levels of trust (Fig 1), this implies that for this group,

396

the pandemic had less of a negative impact on their trust in other people. With respect

397

for the additional control variables that are not reported in Table 2, only respondents’

398

age has a significant nonlinear effect: Older people generally report less negative

399

changes in their trust in other people, although this effect is heavily inversely U-shaped.

400

There are, however, no differences in the change of trust during the pandemic with

401

regard to people’s education, occupational status, residential mobility, partnership

403

Robustness

404

Table 1 demonstrates that the change in neighboring is endogenous. If the covariates in

405

Table 2 do not account for this endogeneity, results are likely biased [67, 68]. As a first

406

test, we thus need to check whether we can treat the change in neighboring as an

407

exogenous variable in the second part of analysis. This can easily be done by including

408

the residuals of a regression of the change scores on all the covariates from both models

409

in Tables 1 and 2 in the second step of analysis (Durbin–Wu–Hausman test — [68]).

410

Table 3 depicts the result of this exercise. For the sake of robust inference, the

May 18, 2021

411

test-statistic is based on 500 bootstrap samples [69]. While we clearly fail to reject the

412

null-hypothesis of an exogenous influence of the change in neighborhood relation on the

413

change in subjective well-being (χ2 (1) = 0.063, p = 0.802), the situation is less clear in

414

the case of generalized trust. With a χ2 value of 3.177 and one degree of freedom, we

415

only slightly fail to reject the null of an exogenous influence. The corresponding p-value

416

of 0.075, based on 500 bootstrap replications, indicates that the change in neighboring

417

behavior – given the set of covariates – might be endogenous when modeling the change

418

in generalized trust between 2020 and 2019. Given the 500 bootstrap replications and

419

the difficulties in finding adequate instruments to account for the potential endogeneity

420

(IV-estimation – [68]), we are confident that at most only minor bias is introduced.

421

Nevertheless, one should be cautious when interpreting the positive effect of changes in

422

neighborly relations on the change in generalized trust during COVID-19.

423

As a second, more general test of the models presented thus far, this study uses a

424

placebo regression approach to test whether the changes in neighborly relations were

425

indeed induced by the pandemic and whether improving relations buffer the negative

426

impacts on subjective well-being and trust in other people. To this end, the models are

re-estimated for the period prior to the pandemic. Since neighborhood and other social

428

networks are only inquired every third year, this corresponds to the changes in

429

neighborly relations between 2016 and 2019. Likewise, the change in satisfaction with

430

life and generalized trust is examined for the same time period. Unlike in the main

431

analyses, the change in neighborly relations has to be constructed. To this end, the

432

difference in self-reported frequency of contact with neighbors is used. Moreover, the

433

other network variables (size of one’s neighborhood, friendship, and online social

434

network) are assessed by means of the 2016 measures. All the other variables are the

435

same as in the main analyses.

436

Table 4 depicts the main results of the placebo regression approach. All the other

May 18, 2021

437

original model variables are included, but are not reported, and are mostly insignificant

438

(which makes sense, since having went through, for example, a COVID-19 infection in

439

2020 can by no means influence the change in subjective well-being or trust between

440

2016 and 2019 – see Table S2 for the complete list of results). The change in neighborly

441

relation between 2016 and 2019 has no significant influence on the change in subjective

442

well-being and trust in other people during that time period. Nor do the other network

443

measures generally have an influence. Only those with a larger online network in 2016

444

seem to experience slightly higher change scores in subjective well-being. Likewise, there

445

is a small positive effect of the size of one’s friendship network on the change in trust.

446

The absence of an effect of the change in neighborly relations, however, highlights that

447

the pattern found before is indeed attributable to the experiences made during the

448

20/35

May 18, 2021

COVID-19 crisis. Overall, the results of the placebo regression approach thus

449

strengthens the interpretation from the main analyses: The COVID-19 pandemic not

450

only led to overall lower subjective well-being and trust in other people [38, 59], but it

451

also changed the interaction with neighbors. Most importantly, having made positive

452

experiences with neighbors during the crisis increased individual and community

453

resilience, and buffered the negative impacts of the pandemic on subjective well-being

454

and generalized trust.

455

Discussion

456

There is considerable evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted

457

people’s mental health, subjective well-being, and trust in other people as well as in

458

governmental entities [38, 41, 44, 59]. At the same time, we have witnessed a surge in

459

help among neighbors to cope with the challenges imposed by the crisis [36, 52]. This

460

study examined how and who’s neighborhood relations changed during the pandemic

461

and how this change is associated with life satisfaction as an overreaching dimension of

462

subjective well-being on the one hand, and generalized trust in people on the other. In

463

line with a previous study from Wuhan that found a buffering effect of neighborhood

464

infrastructure and services against the adverse influences of the COVID-19 pandemic on

465

people’s mental health [36], this study demonstrated that an improvement in neighborly

466

relations significantly reduced the negative impact of the crisis on people’s subjective

467

well-being and trust, although in a nonlinear fashion (Fig 3). This finding is also in line

468

with work that highlights the importance of change and reference points more generally

469

for the development of individual subjective well-being [13, 25]. On average, a one-point

470

change in neighborly relations is associated with an 0.36 point increase in the subjective

471

well-being change score and an 0.29 point increase in the generalized trust change score.

472

In magnitude, these effects are comparable to the one of individual subjective health

473

and are considerably stronger than other network influences.

474

However, not everybody was equally likely to improve their relations with neighbors

475

during the pandemic. Those who had received a lot of practical support from neighbors,

476

those with more frequent contact with friends, and people with a larger online social

477

network prior to the pandemic were more likely to improve their neighborly relations.

478

21/35

May 18, 2021

Also, people who had experienced COVID-19 infections in their close social network

479

were more likely to report improved relations, while those in good health themselves

480

were less likely to report a deterioration of relations with neighbors. The strongest

481

effect, however, was observed with regard to respondents’ educational background:

482

Having completed tertiary education increased the likelihood of improving one’s relation

483

with neighbors by almost 16 percentage points. Moreover, people living in urban centers

484

rather than suburban communities and women were also about 5 percentage points

485

more likely to report an improvement in neighborly relations. Consequently, especially

486

people who entered the pandemic with more resources and support (i.e., with higher

487

educational degrees, less financial problems, more support from their social network)

488

improved their relations with neighbors during the crisis and consequently had seen

489

their subjective well-being and trust less impacted by the strain caused by the

490

pandemic. One interpretation of this finding is an increase in social inequality in terms

491

of well-being and the resources that can be mobilized from neighbors [4]. However, it is

492

possible that this pattern emerges because those with more resources were more able to

493

help their neighbors [50], experiencing a feeling of warm glow of giving in return [70],

494

which increased their subjective well-being. Irrespective of the reason, however, a social

495

gradient in the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people’s subjective

496

well-being and trusts exists [71], and partly works through the changes induced in their

497

neighborhood social network.

498

Limitations

Although the robustness checks in form of placebo regressions, that is, applying the

500

model to a pre-COVID19 period, suggest that the documented effects are indeed

501

attributable to processes caused by the pandemic, there are nevertheless several

502

limitations to keep in mind. First, the change in relations with neighbors might be

503

endogenous beyond the controls applied in this study. While testing for endogeneity

504

using a Durban-Wu-Hausman approach [68] clearly showed that the change in

505

neighborly relations during the pandemic has an exogenous effect on people’s subjective

506

well-being, the results for respondents’ trust in other people, the second dependent

507

variable in this study, was more ambiguous. Although the null-hypothesis of an

508

22/35

exogenous influence cannot be ruled out when using 500 bootstrap samples, the

509

corresponding p-value is nevertheless rather small and endogeneity might thus be an

510

issue, potentially biasing the positive effect of improving neighborly relations on the

511

change in people’s generalized trust.

512

More importantly, this study cannot use the full potential of longitudinal data to

May 18, 2021

513

assess causal effects [72]. In the data, changes in neighborly relations during the

514

pandemic were directly obtained by means of a subjective measure rather than a

515

repeated measurement of neighborly relations. The change score of neighborly relations

516

in this study thus differs methodologically from “traditional” change score analysis,

517

where the score is constructed as the difference of two subsequent measures [64, 65].

518

Consequently, the analysis of the determinants of changing neighborly relations during

519

the pandemic might still be subject to unobserved heterogeneity. Meanwhile, this is less

520

of a problem in the analyses of how improving relations with neighbors buffer the

521

negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people’s subjective well-being and trust,

522

since the dependent variables are constructed by differing the values of subsequent

523

waves. Moreover, the placebo regressions, applying the models to pre-COVID-19 waves

524

of the data, reinforce the interpretation of a pandemic-induced change in neighborly

525

relations and its buffering effect for subjective well-being and trust. Nevertheless, the

526

results of this study should be seen as a description rather than a causal analysis of how

527

the pandemic changed people’s relation with neighbors and how this in turn is

528

associated with the change in life satisfaction as an overarching dimension of subjective

529

well-being on the one, and on the change in generalized trust on the other hand.

530

Finally, the point in time and the specific national context might limit the

531

generalizability of the results. The additional data collection of the Swiss Household

532

Panel took place about one month after the end of the first lockdown in Switzerland.

533

Compared to other countries, this lockdown was not as strict (there were, for example,

534

no curfews) and lasted only 41 days. Consequently, especially the impact on people’s

535

subjective well-being might have been less pronounced than in other countries – an

536

assumption that is also supported by the observation in this study that satisfaction with

537

life quickly returns to pre-COVID-19 levels as the days pass since the end of the

538

lockdown. At the same time, however, the negative impact of the crisis on people’s trust

539

is found to be more enduring and thus might also relate more generally to other

540

23/35

national contexts.

541

Conclusion

542

Neighbors are an important source of everyday help and support [33, 35, 50]. This is

543

especially true in times of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. While previous

544

studies highlighted the importance of neighborhood resources and institutions [36], this

545

study showed how improving relations with neighbors to some extent protected against

546

the negative impact of the pandemic and social confinement on people’s subjective

547

well-being. Moreover, existing studies also looked at how social capital and generalized

548

trust affected the development of the pandemic, for example whether people complied

549

with the measures taken to control the spread of COVID-19 [73, 74]. Against the

550

background of the formation of social capital and trust in the local context [26, 42, 43],

551

this study also investigated the reverse link and demonstrated that improving relations

552

with neighbors buffer the negative impact of the pandemic on people’s trust in other

553

people.

554

The results of this study come with several implications for both research and policy.

May 18, 2021

555

First, this study highlighted the importance of investigating effects of neighborhoods

556

and neighbors not only on objective but also on subjective measures of

557

well-being [4, 10, 11, 55]. Moreover, not everybody was equally likely to improve relations

558

with neighbors during the crisis. In this regard, especially those with more resources in

559

terms of education, finances, and social networks – as well as women – were more likely

560

to report an increase in neighboring. Consequently, future research as well as public

561

policy should thus carefully consider the socially unequal impact of initiatives that aim

562

at promoting local social networks and neighborhood social capital. Second, supporting

563

community resilience at the neighborhood level can be a powerful approach to help

564

people, especially the elderly and at-risk groups, to get through times of crisis [33]. In

565

this regard, the effects of improving neighborly relations outweigh many of the

566

individual-level effects, such as the effects of one’s financial situation. Targeted

567

neighborhood initiatives might therefore not only provide everyday support to neighbors

568

but they are likely especially suited to protect against the negative impacts of social

569

confinement and isolation. Finally, given the positive association of improving

570

24/35

neighborly relations with generalized trust, such neighborhood initiatives bear the

571

potential to strengthen social cohesion beyond their local scope. Consequently, local

572

interventions that foster contact, exchange, and interactions among neighbors are of

573

value for the functioning of the whole society.
