Abstract: Little attention has been paid to the impacts of institutional–human–environment dimensions on the outcome of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) abatement. Through the diagnostic
social–ecological system (SES) framework, this review paper aimed to investigate what and how
the multifaceted social, physical, and governance factors affected the success level of seven selected
Asia-Pacific countries (namely, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia, and
New Zealand) in combatting COVID-19. Drawing on statistical data from the Our World In Data website, we measured the COVID-19 severity or abatement success level of the countries on the basis of
cumulative positive cases, average daily cases, and mortality rates for the period of 1 February 2020
to 30 June 2020. A qualitative content analysis using three codes, i.e., present (P), partially present
(PP), and absent (A) for each SES attribute, as well as score calculation and rank ordering for government response effectiveness and the abatement success level across the countries, was undertaken.
Not only did the standard coding process ensure data comparability but the data were deemed
substantially reliable with Cohen’s kappa of 0.76. Among 13 attributes of the SES factors, high
facility adequacy, comprehensive COVID-19 testing policies, strict lockdown measures, imposition of
penalty, and the high trust level towards the government seemed to be significant in determining
the COVID-19 severity in a country. The results show that Vietnam (ranked first) and New Zealand
(ranked second), with a high presence of attributes/design principles contributing to high-level
government stringency and health and containment indices, successfully controlled the virus, while
Indonesia (ranked seventh) and Japan (ranked sixth), associated with the low presence of design
principles, were deemed least successful. Two lessons can be drawn: (i) having high number of P for
SES attributes does not always mean a panacea for the pandemic; however, it would be detrimental
to a country if it lacked them severely, and (ii) some attributes (mostly from the governance factor)
may carry higher weightage towards explaining the success level. This comparative study providing
an overview of critical SES attributes in relation to COVID-19 offers novel policy insights, thus
helping policymakers devise more strategic, coordinated measures, particularly for effective country
preparedness and response in addressing the current and the future health crisis.

1. Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was unknown to the masses prior to its first
case in December 2019 [1,2], although there were speculations that the earliest case

dated back to November 2019 [3]. It was first regarded as viral pneumonia but was
then analyzed to be a viral infection that has the capability to be transmitted through
human-to-human interaction [4].
As of June 2020, there were countries that had successfully mitigated the problem,
while some were struggling and had failed due to countless reasons. Much emphasis has
been focused on the science and pharmaceutical dimensions in effort to produce vaccines
to cure the pandemic, although it is believed that social behaviors and other potential
non-pharmaceutical approaches, despite being intangible, indirect, and leaning towards
prosociality (i.e., collective interest) via a cooperative action, can also contribute to curbing
the pandemic [5]. Utilizing this research, we carried out an integration between health and
the systemic institutional–social–ecological system (SES) framework, apart from knowing
its relevancy when applied outside its commons domain, in order to specifically identify
answers to the following research question: How can the diagnostic Institutional Analysis
and Development (IAD)–SES framework help answer the level of success or failure of
countries in curbing the pandemic? It has come to attention that there is a noticeable gap
of research in exploring what and how institutional–social–ecological dimensions of the
Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) or SES framework help in understanding
the unprecedented crisis. More precisely, given the numerous exogenous factors, this study
identifies which SES attributes (design principles) are significant and effective in explaining
and thus curbing the pandemic. The framework, synonymous with commons and resource
management or collective action, is rarely applied to a health and disease-related topic such
as COVID-19; therefore, relationships between the transmission risk or severity of COVID19 and socio-economic and environmental factors via the SES lens should be explored in
order to devise a holistic strategy in mitigating the pandemic.
The Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework and SES are both
developed by Elinor Ostrom [6]. The former, mostly adopted by social scientists, is primarily used to evaluate the effects of institutional arrangements, as well as the physical
environment and local community in explaining a certain contextual outcome. It was
envisioned as a systematic tool for scholars of different disciples to communicate with each
other regardless of their broad perspectives to pave a way towards better understanding
of a situation [7]. Within the framework, it is important to understand the action situation/interaction that actors are in, plausible choices made by them, and how it will affect
the pattern of the outcome. In order to predict choices that will be made, we must know
(i) the resources brought into the situation; (ii) the valuation assigned by the actor to the
state of the world and to the action; (iii) how the actor acquires, processes, retains, and
uses the knowledge and information; and (iv) the ways used by the actor in selecting a
particular decision [8].
The IAD framework, however, is criticized as it lacks in terms of diversity and complexity of natural system and processes [7]. Therefore, SES is an improved version building
upon the IAD framework by expanding the basic variables into more relevant categories, as
shown in Figure 1. The SES framework provides a more detailed variable oriented analysis
of the social–ecological system [7]. According to Partelow, SES is “a conceptual framework
providing a list of variables that may be interacting and affecting outcomes in social-ecological systems” [9]. Via the identified SES attributes, consistent with the application spirit of IAD, we
are able to diagnose and explain the interaction (activities) and the outcome of a situation.
The community and governance attributes in the IAD context have been maintained as
social and governance systems in an SES, while biophysical/ecological attributes converge
into two sections, namely, resource systems and resource units. SES, normally applied in
the context of commons governance [10], is proven to be versatile and adaptable due to its
generality (see the complex adaptive system [11]). It also enables a comparison of different
settings in a study where data are collected with the means to compare [9].

and Cox [12].

By adopting the SES framework, researchers have an organized variable-oriented and
process-oriented line of arguments, involving systematic networks of action situations and
hence a more informed decision [7,13]. Based on the research conducted by Raboisson and
Lhermie [14] and Wilcox et al. [15] situating the SES framework in the human wellbeing
and healthcare setting, when adapted into the context of COVID-19, the institutional–social–
physical attributes (e.g., penalty, lockdown, facilities, technology, population density, and
past knowledge) and their interaction (e.g., monitoring, communication, swab testing,
containment enforcement) would influence the number of cumulative cases, average daily
cases, and the mortality rate, and thus translate the success level of a country into low,
medium, and high, as diagrammatized in Figure 2.

Theoretically, some design principles (DP) or critical success factors that are present
in a successful resource management system should also exist in successful pandemic
containment and mitigation. The hypothesis was that the higher the amount/frequency
of design principles (successful attributes) that are present in countries, the higher the
success level of them in curbing the pandemic. Despite all these factors, research focusing
on socio-economic and socio-ecological drivers of the COVID-19 transmission remains
scarce, when in fact it holds an equally important role as a critical determinant of COVID-19
transmission risks. Although few studies link both socio-ecological and climate factors
with transmission levels of COVID-19, one study proved that the latter (climatic factor)
does not have a significant effect, and hence its absence in this paper [17]. Therefore,
this study attempts to contribute theoretically and methodologically by expanding the
application of the SES framework and its institutional–social–ecological design principles
in the COVID-19 context. Studying these factors should also be of practical significance
because the findings can serve as a reference that helps provide insightful directions about
COVID-19 abatement. The following sections of the paper further elaborate the topic in
terms of (i) study areas; (ii) methods of data collection and analysis; (iii) results, findings,
and discussions; and (iv) lastly a conclusion.
2. Methodology
2.1. Study Areas
Via the above literature review of SES design principles in terms of primary attributes
and their sub-attributes in relation to the COVID-19 context, we carried out a comparative
study for the selected countries located in the Asia-Pacific region. This study enlisted
Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia, and New Zealand as study
areas and classified them into 3 categories, namely, countries that (i) had successfully
flattened the curve (i.e., high success level of abatement), (ii) attempted to flatten the
curve (medium success level of abatement), and (iii) failed to flatten the curve. Such
categorization was based on their cumulative cases, average daily cases, and mortality
rates. Table 1 illustrates overall data of the 3 criteria for each country for the period between
1 February and 30 June 2020. However, since the dates of the data are varied as displayed
in the Our World In Data website (due to the fact that each country’s first confirmed and
mortality cases were different), for better data consistency and accuracy, we processed
(standardized) the data prior to using them for the analysis. For example, since the specific
timeframe focused here was from 1 February to 30 June 2020, cases displayed in terms
of cumulative cases, daily confirmed cases, and mortality rate prior to 1 February 2020
were discounted or excluded from this study. This was important in order to reduce data
distortion that would cause imprecision of the result later. From the dataset, Vietnam fared
the best, with average daily cases of 2.34 and a mortality rate of 0%, as illustrated in Table 1.
Figure 3 shows that the linear cumulative cases of Vietnam were also the lowest, i.e., 353.
The government’s swift and strict measures had proven to be successful as the country
was one of the earliest to eliminate the virus [18]. Meanwhile, Indonesia recorded the
linear cumulative cases of 56,385 with average daily cases of 466, and this figure was the
highest among the 7 countries. However, its mortality rate came second after Japan. See
Figures 4 and 5 for graphs showing daily confirmed cases and mortality rates across the
7 countries during the period. The next paragraph provides a brief background for each
country as to how and when COVID-19 cases started to emerge.
Cases of COVID-19 had first emerged in these countries from early January to the
end of February. In some countries, COVID-19 was brought in by Chinese nationals
or individuals returning from China or Iran, such as in Singapore, New Zealand, and
Japan [19–21]. Indonesia recorded its first case after a national came in contact with an
infected person in Malaysia [22]. Even so, Japan was the first country recording a humanto-human transmission as its first case did not visit the market but was in close contact
with a pneumonia patient [20]. In some countries, the first case did not necessarily lead to
a booming number of cases. In Malaysia, cases started to skyrocket due to a religious event

in Sri Petaling in March, attended by almost 16,000 individuals from Malaysia and other
countries [23]. The same phenomenon occurred in South Korea when an elderly woman in
Daegu was tested positive for the virus. She attended a 10,000-member mass gathering at
the Shincheonji Church [24].

2.2. Data Collection
To execute a comparative analysis across the 7 countries, we had outlined a total of
13 attributes (with 5 social attributes, 3 physical attributes, and 5 institutional attributes)
and their respective sub-attributes, on the basis of the 3 primary SES factors. More precisely, the 13 exogenous factors were derived from (i) the established literature of the SES
framework in commons management (e.g., types of local leadership, homogeneity level,
resources/technology or facility availability) and (ii) the mainstream and relevant literature
and findings of COVID in terms of potential factors that affect the pandemic. Moreover,
sufficient availability of the above data or information particularly pertaining to factors
influencing the pandemic was also taken into account. At the same time, the interaction
arena attributes comprising the government stringency index, the health and containment
index, and the economic index, which are influenced by the 13 attributes, were selected as
they represent the activity levels or response effectiveness of governments that eventually
determine the COVID-19 outcome. To summarize this, Table 2 illustrates an operational
framework that classifies 3 SES factors that comprise attributes and sub-attributes (such
as exogenous variables) and their working definitions, components within the interaction arena (activities/responses), and the success level of COVID-19 abatement (as an
outcome variable).
This study made use solely of secondary sources, such as research papers, government
documents/policies, official newsletters, and websites specifically pertaining to gathering
COVID-19 data on the basis of the predetermined SES attributes across 7 countries; statistical data in terms of the number of COVID cases; and COVID-related research findings
on factors influencing COVID-19 severity or transmission risks as well as governments’
responses when dealing with the pandemic. Keywords such as “IAD-SES framework”,
“social–ecological system”, and “COVID-19” were used on Google Scholar to garner information. Other than this, we also referred to ourworldindata.org to collect statistical data on
cumulative cases, mortality rates, and the average daily confirmed cases. Moreover, prior
to explaining the COVID-19 (abatement success level) outcome of a country, on the basis of
the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) numerical data, we also
referred to the 18 policy indicators of government responses categorized into 3 main indices,
namely, the Government Response Stringency Index (on containment and closure policies,
such as school closures and restrictions in movement), the Health and Containment Index
(on COVID-19 testing regime or emergency investments into healthcare), and the Economic
Index (on income support to citizens or provision of foreign aid), as they served as an
important data input for the “interaction or action arena” (responses) of the SES framework
to ensure the coherency and validity of the data (i.e., attribute input-influencing factors).

However, it is worth noting that the data extracted only cover information from the month
of February 2020 to June 2020. The specific timeframe was chosen as most country cases
were at their peak.
Table 2. An operational framework comprising list of attributes, its working definitions, and effects towards COVID19 abatement.
Factors

Working Definitions
(Sub-Attributes)

Assumptions/Effects towards COVID-19
Abatement (Outcome)

Low population density

Number of population per land
area/size of a country [25,26]

With lower population density, it may have
a lower risk of COVID-19 transmission
considering more spacious environment for
less close human interaction. High
population density tends to be associated
with the overcrowding issue, and this may
likely lead to decreases in the quality of
living conditions and sanitation, and thus
the transmission rate may be high.

High social homogeneity

Homogeneity in terms of
socio-cultural and demographic
context (e.g., background, interest,
ethnicity, and language) [27]

With higher social homogeneity, it may
result in the higher cooperation level
among the people and less self-interest
among the community, emphasising
collective interest and thus the higher level
of COVID-19 abatement.

High level of trust
among citizens

Trust level between the community
and governments measured by
effective communication and
government’s capability [28,29]

With a higher level of trust between the
community and the government in terms
of governments’ capability in handling the
pandemic and effective communication,
there may be higher compliance to
government rules, and therefore better
COVID-19 abatement.

Sufficient local management
knowledge and experience

Taking into account previous
contagions, e.g., SARS, MERS, and
H1N1 that have similar features as
COVID-19 [30]

With the past experiences and knowledge
in dealing with previous pandemics, a
nation (the government and the people)
may have better abatement strategies.

Effective foreign
worker containment

Special containment measures and
environments in terms of
accommodation and facilities
provided for foreign workers to
avoid local cluster outbreak [31]

Effective foreign worker containment via
specific measures can have a lower
transmission risk and thus better
COVID-19 abatement.

High adequacy of
facilities [32]

This attribute covers the density
of physician
(per 10,000) and healthcare facilities

Countries with a sufficient number of
physician and healthcare facilities
signifying high mobility of those facilities
for COVID-19 treatment can better abate
the pandemic.

High technology
availability [33]

Concerning whether a country is
equipped with high technological
tools and facilities in dealing with
COVID-19, including contact
tracing application, testing policy,
test kit production,
ventilator
production, PPE production

It is hypothesized that a country equipped
with high technological facilities and tools
can cope better with the pandemic in terms
of providing timely and sufficient
treatment for patients.

High economic
performance [31]

Considering the GNI per capita of a
country, which determine the
economic status by the World Bank

High-income countries that signify high
economic performance in terms of GNI per
capita can cope better with the pandemic
by providing financial relief and more
efficient technological/facility support.

(Sub-Attributes)

Assumptions/Effects towards COVID-19
Abatement (Outcome)

Presence of top-down
leadership [34]

Measured by the Democracy Index
(based on the types of government
leadership—democratic
or authoritarian).

Countries with strong or firm (autocratic)
leadership presence can better ensure
compliant behaviours (i.e., better
cooperation among citizens) and therefore
better COVID-19 abatement.

Strict penalty [35]

Some form of punishment or fine
is imposed on several conditions,
namely, fleeing quarantine,
violating lockdown, incompliance
with the government order, not
wearing mask at public areas, and
spreading fake news

Countries with penalty imposition on
violators may have a better control of the
pandemic. It is believed that with this
stringent imposition, self-interest
behaviour of an individual can be
discouraged and thus prosocial
(compliant) behaviour towards collective
interest can be promoted, which is better
for COVID-19 abatement

Strict lockdown
imposition [36–39]

Lockdown imposition covers
school closure, border closure,
gathering bans, work from home
policy, national lockdown,
localized lockdown, and
military enforcement

Countries with strict lockdown
enforcement limiting certain non-essential
activities (lesser human interactions) can
help stem local transmission risks and
thus reduce daily confirmed cases or
fatality rates.

Strict standard of procedure in
public areas [40,41]

Mask-wearing, social distancing,
health checks and
temperature scanning

Countries with strict standard of
procedure imposition, especially in public
areas, for promoting effective monitoring
and reducing transmission risks can help
curb the pandemic.

Emergency response plan and
COVID-19 testing policy [42]

This attribute emphasizes
economy stimulus,
repurposing of existing buildings
into healthcare facilities, and the
COVID-19 testing policy (i.e.,
whether the test is required by
anyone with symptoms or
without symptoms)

Countries that provide economy stimulus
for its citizens for livelihood purposes can
help curb the local transmission risk, and
countries with a plan to repurpose some
buildings into healthcare for
accommodating and treating more
patients can help reduce transmission
risks and daily cases or mortality rate.
Countries adopting a more
inclusive/comprehensive COVID-19
testing policy can detect cases earlier and
control the spread more effectively.

Government Stringency
Index [18,43]

This index is about containment
and closure policies, such as school
closures and restrictions
in movement

Health and Containment
Index [18,43]

This is about COVID-19 testing
regime or emergency investments
into healthcare

Economic Support
Index [18,43]

This is about income support to
citizens or provision of foreign aid

COVID-19 abatement success
level for the period between
1 February and
30 June 2020 [17,18,44]

Determined by three indicators,
namely, (i) cumulative cases, (ii)
average daily cases, and (iii)
mortality rates

These three indices reflecting the
governments’ activities and response
effectiveness, determined by the attributes
define the outcome (i.e., the COVID-19
abatement level). High stringency,
containment, and economic support
indices are associated with the higher
success level of COVID-19 abatement.
The higher the number of the three
indicators (i.e., high cumulative cases,
mortality rate, and average daily cases),
determined by the abovementioned
attributes and interaction activities, the
lower the success level of COVID-19
abatement and vice versa.

2.3. Data Analysis
The study primarily employed a qualitative content analysis to study institutional–
social–ecological attributes using Ostrom’s 8 design principles [6] as one of the theoretical
underpinnings. To aid the comparative analysis, we constructed a coding system, based on
both textual and quantitative evidence, and used it to determine IAD-based SES attribute
occurrence in each country, meaning that each attribute was assigned with a code on
the basis of the ratio or percentage of DP/attribute presence/occurrence [45], i.e., mostly
absent/absent (A) (with 0–29%), sometimes/partially present (PP) (with 30–69%), or
mostly present or present (P) (with 70–100%). This coding process, particularly for the
comparative analysis of a limited number of cases where a statistical inferential analysis
is not possible, is scientifically appropriate and relevant since it is based on several SES
scholars’ systematic methodologies that have been widely applied in different resource
management contexts [46–48]. Ultimately, in line with Ostrom’s successful commons
governance focusing on the importance of the presence of design principles, a higher
frequency/co-occurrence of P indicates a better COVID-19 containment and therefore a
higher success rate of the country, while a lower count of P connoting a higher frequency
of A or PP means otherwise. Moreover, a quantitative method, apart from providing the
percentage of DP occurrence and assessing the frequency of attributes present as well as
for the purpose of calculating scores and assigning ranks was also used to supplement
the qualitative analysis. To ensure the consistency or credibility of the coding process
between two coders, we conducted inter-rater reliability of Cohen’s kappa using SPSS
for the reliability of all 12 SES attributes (excluding effective foreign worker containment)
across 7 countries where, instead of seven items per attribute which are inadequate in
terms of the minimum sample size, altogether 84 items were analyzed. The cut-off point for
substantial or good reliability/agreement is 0.61-0.80 [49,50]. Next, the 3 indices that form
the interaction arena (government responses), in terms of the scores, were assigned with
different codes, namely, high (H), medium (M), and low (L) (see Table 3). Since the data for
each index varied from time to time, the highest score was considered when assigning the
code, instead of an average score; considering the countries’ different COVID-19 severity
levels and situations that affect the indices, using the latter may not be accurate as it
probably understates the true level or index of a country.

Containment Index, and the Economic Support Index.

At the same time, the success level of a country (outcome), influenced by the above
DPs and 3 indices, was measured and determined on the basis of the total scores obtained
from the 3 criteria, namely, the cumulative number of cases of each country, average daily
confirmed cases, and the mortality rate of the country [17,44]. More precisely, the total
scores were calculated based on the ranking among the 7 countries (i.e., first to seventh)
and values assigned (from 1 to 7) to each criterion. Table 4 summarizes the options of
values for each rank as well as the score ranges (from 3 to 21) for the high, medium, and
low outcomes.

3. Results and Discussions
On the basis of the analysis, we show in Table 5 a summarized result spanning seven
countries with respective SES attributes and interactions, as well as the success level of
abatement. On the whole, with the overall kappa reliability of 0.76 where p < 0.01, the
coding of 84 items under the 12 SES attributes was considered substantially reliable. It was
found that in terms of the ranking and scoring values, only Vietnam and New Zealand,
with scores ≥ 16, were deemed successful or had high success in terms of COVID-19
abatement, while Japan and Indonesia were deemed the least successful countries in
abating the pandemic, with scores less than 10. The remaining three countries, namely,
Malaysia, Singapore, and South Korea, were considered to be at the medium level. For the
presence or occurrence level/frequency of SES attributes, New Zealand and Singapore had
the highest number of Ps, (i.e., eight Ps and one A), followed by Vietnam (with seven Ps
and one A) and South Korea (with six Ps and one A). While Malaysia had scored the most
PPs (i.e., eight), Indonesia and Japan had the highest number of As, i.e., at least two As
for the SES attributes. From this result, we found that the SES design principle/attribute
presence level appeared to be associated with the three indices on the government activity
and response level, which therefore help explain the success level of COVID-19 abatement.
Generally, countries with a higher number of Ps for SES attributes were more likely to score
at a medium or high level for the overall three indices (e.g., New Zealand, South Korea,
Singapore), except for Vietnam, with the high number of Ps having scored a low level for the
economic index. The prevalence of association between attribute occurrence and the index
level was even more prominent for countries such as Japan and Indonesia that had the
lowest number of Ps or highest number of As for the SES attributes, where this tended to be
associated with the low-level indices. The level of indices (whether it was high, medium, or
low) reasonably determined by the co-occurrence of SES attributes consequently explained
the abatement success level of a country in terms of the number of infections (daily average
and cumulative) as well as mortality rate; the higher the level of indices, particularly for
the Government Stringency Index and the Health And Containment Index, the higher the
success level of a country in abating the pandemic (see Vietnam and New Zealand) and
vice versa. More detailed explanations of results for each country in terms of each SES
attribute are provided later.
3.1. Low Population Density
In a study performed by Kadi and Khelfaoui in Algeria, the authors found that
population density indeed played a role in the transmission of the virus [51]. This is also
supported by a study done by Bhadra et al. in different districts of India [26]. However,
it cannot be a strong explanatory factor as to why the number of cases are as known [52].
Among the seven countries, based on the rank-size rule, distributing population density
into 3 categories, Singapore, coded A, has the highest population density (8358 per km2 ),
as shown in Table 5. Despite the high population density, the country, having adequate
facilities and economic strength, managed to keep the number of positive cases and the
death rate under control. In contrast, Indonesia fumbled, despite having a lower population
density; this is probably due to other SES factors, such as shortage of healthcare facilities,

weak institutional arrangement for strict enforcement, and also economic conditions as one
of the considerations.

3.2. High Social Homogeneity
As seen in Table 5 above, Vietnam, South Korea, and Japan were justified as P because their populations appear to be relatively homogenous in terms of culture and some
demographic attributes (e.g., ethnics and language). Meanwhile, other countries were considered as PP due to their heterogeneity in terms of multicultural and racial settings, such
as Malaysia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Singapore. Culturally, Japanese people have
always upheld a high standard of hygiene and obedience (compliance). They have always
practiced social distancing as they respect personal space. Wearing masks when feeling
sick is a norm to prevent passing a virus to others [53]. Hence, there are no objections
among its citizens when mask rules were enforced by the government. However, to posit
the idea that the homogeneity of a nation contributes positively to the rate of success seems
rather farfetched as the analysis showed that it does not play a major role.
3.3. High Level of Trust
Table 6 shows the level of trust among citizens towards governments of each country.
Having trust from the people ensures that the public follows the rules undisputedly (i.e.,
higher compliance), allowing the leaders to convince them of mass testing and quarantines
before things become worse and hence keeping the virus at bay earlier on [29]. In other
words, having citizens’ high trust towards the government may contribute positively to
the success level of a country in curbing the pandemic. For example, countries such as
Singapore and New Zealand are deemed to have trust due to transparency and the leader’s
excellent risk communication. Meanwhile, other countries’ governments (Malaysia, South
Korea, and Vietnam) had constantly proven their competency, hence garnering public trust
in their capabilities [24,29,31,54,55]. In Vietnam, the people believe that the government is
working for the betterment of the country; the Vietnamese government is also competent
in providing prompt communication and medical supplies, thus allowing them to carry
out strategies similar to wealthier countries despite being a lower income nation [29].

Scoring 0.486 in a public survey conducted by Fetzer et al. [56], the Republic of
Indonesia has been speculated to be hiding the real number of cases in the country by
activists and political opponents. Japan’s government too faced the same problem. The
government has been labelled distrustful by the Edelman Barometer, and this was also
backed up by the public survey, where the survey stated that more than half of its citizens
(60.2%) had perceived the government as being untruthful in containing the spread of
COVID-19 [56]. To date, all countries practice a coordinated information campaign, which
promotes effective communication between the government and citizens, allowing a twoway communication between both sides. This ensures citizens are well informed on the
current state of virus spread in the country and ways to mitigate it. In certain country, this
step helps solidify the government as a prominent leadership figure in the country.
3.4. Sufficient Local Management Knowledge and Experience
Sufficient local management knowledge and experience are mostly present in all
seven countries, as seen in Table 5. These attributes take into account each country’s
experience in dealing with similar diseases to COVID-19, which in this case are Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1704

13 of 27

Novel Influenza A (H1N1). The outbreak of SARS, H1N1, and MERS occurred in 2003, 2009,
and 2012, respectively. SARS, MERS and COVID-19 are caused by Betacoronavirus genus
while Influenza A viruses lead to H1N1. SARS and MERS possessed a lower transmission
risk but significantly higher fatality rates [57]. As for H1N1, it has been classified as having
a self-limited mild-to-moderate transmission risk, although there have been reports of
fatal outcomes [58].
These experiences helped certain countries better prepare and improve a healthcare
system in infection prevention and control, activate response protocols, increase number
of thermal scanners at all borders, and realize the importance of isolating infected cases
and quarantine measures [54,59,60]. This means that countries with the past experiences
and knowledge in handling related pandemic contagions can cope better with COVID-19.
Contrary to other countries (e.g., New Zealand, South Korea, Vietnam, and Malaysia) who
have experienced at least two pandemics, Japan has comparatively less past experiences
(i.e., as seen in Table 7, only experiencing one pandemic). For example, in terms of its onetime H1N1 experience, Japan opted for less testing in handling the COVID-19 pandemic.
This was probably due to the previous outbreak experienced by Japan that saw the public
flocking to hospitals to get tested, which subsequently increased the transmission risks.
Thus, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare was concerned that crowded hospital
lobbies would lead to a surge of COVID-19 cases and hence finalized their decision to limit
accessibility [61]. Perhaps such a decision based on its limited experience may be rather
ill-considered, since other countries that had experienced more than one pandemic took
a different course of action (e.g., South Korea instead promoted more testing in order to
curb the transmission risk). However, despite the above, in which the failure of Japan
is well justified, Indonesia, coded PP similar to New Zealand, Vietnam, and Singapore,
showed otherwise, where it also failed to control the pandemic. It can be deduced that this
seemingly significant attribute may not necessarily be critical in explaining the severity of
the pandemic.

3.5. Effective Foreign Worker Influx Containment
Table 5 shows that both Malaysia and Singapore had a large influx of foreign workers,
leading to clusters of COVID-19 cases. If there is a proper containment system of those
workers, it would be indicated as P. On the other hand, other countries were marked N/A,
which means this attribute was not applicable as they did not have a huge influx of foreign
workers leading to COVID-19 cluster emergence. A proper containment system helps
eradicate possibilities of a surge of cases, therefore controlling the number of cumulative
cases and maintaining a low mortality rate.
The rise of a foreign worker cluster in Singapore was apparent from 15 to 30 March,
comprising almost 61% imported cases. Both Malaysia and Singapore cited that poor living
conditions had sparked a widespread infection among the group [63,64]. The severity of
cases in Malaysia forced the government to employ a more stringent lockdown, called the
Enhanced Movement Control Order (EMCO) [65].
3.6. High Facility Adequacy
In terms of determining the code in Table 5, P translates to countries with high
healthcare facility adequacy, while PP translates to moderate adequacy, and A translates to
a low facility adequacy. Having an ample amount of resources (physicians and facilities)

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1704

14 of 27

translates to a better mobility, hence allowing more patients to be treated at one time.
This would ensure better healthcare services to all. Therefore, the COVID-19 mortality
rate could be lowered. Generally, high-income countries such as South Korea and Japan
possessed sufficient health facilities and manpower (Table 8), except for New Zealand and
Singapore that had a lower number in terms of healthcare facilities [66,67]. However, the
lower income country like Vietnam managed to control the pandemic, probably due to its
governments’ swift strategy as they recognized its inability to contain a high amount of
cases if the pandemic became serious [68].

Indonesia has the lowest density/number of physicians among the seven countries.
In addition, its facilities are in a dire condition [71]. The country’s Ministry of Health has
recognized an uneven distribution of health facilities and quality across Indonesia [71,72].
Some sub-districts in Indonesia did not possess any health center and lacked necessities
such as electricity, clean water, and proper equipment, with limited transportation [73]. An
obvious disparity between rural areas and urban regions is common in many countries,
including Malaysia. Facilities in these rural areas are usually government-funded with
fewer doctors and hence a lower doctor-to-patient ratio [74].
3.7. High Technology Availability
The presence of technology aids governments and healthcare sectors in devising
strategies towards the abatement of the virus. As seen in Table 5, countries with code P
have technologically advanced medical equipment production and have also developed
their own test kits. Having PP for this attribute means limited medical equipment and
lacking in test kit production. All countries had also adopted the use of a contact tracing
application (see Table 9). In Malaysia, the efficiency of contact tracing applications is
moderate, as a study showed that the application MySejahtera uncovered 251 confirmed
COVID-19 cases or 3% of 8308 cases as of June [75].

Some countries had also developed their very own diagnostic kit that can detect
COVID-19 to bolster testing rates in their respective country [26,50,85]. Indonesia’s kits
could be mass-produced with a lower budget, hence lowering expenditure [80]. Next,
drive-thru testing has proven that this system is efficient, as South Korea recorded a higher
testing number due to 50 drive-thru testing facilities being set up as of April 20 [54]. In
addition, most countries produce their own personal protective equipment (PPE) and
ventilators as global supplies dwindle and most manufacturing companies focused on
meeting their own country’s needs [92]. The amount of medical equipment should be
proportional to the country needs to ensure all patients were given the chance to be treated
and healed, thus decreasing mortality rate of the country.
3.8. Economic Performance
As seen in Table 10, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Japan were categorized
as high-income countries. Meanwhile, Malaysia and Indonesia were grouped as upper
middle-income and Vietnam as a lower middle-income country. Having immense resources
based on the economic performance/status allows the government to invest in better
facilities, technology, and remuneration packages that cover broad relief during the crisis,
as seen in Singapore [31]. In addition, this may allow the government to exercise stringent
rules and have effective enforcement. To date, Indonesia has the highest percentage of
poverty among the seven countries, with half of its population struggling to make ends
meet. A national lockdown may not be a preferred choice as it causes their economy to
collapse, affecting their livelihood and putting tens of millions of its people who worked
poorly paid informal jobs at risk [93,94]. Interestingly, despite being a lower middle-income
country, which possibly undermines COVID-19 containment strategies, Vietnam, with the
lowest GNI per capita rank i.e., 141th , managed to curb the pandemic successfully, with this
potentially suggesting that the economic enabling factor may not have direct, significant
impacts on COVID-19 outcome.

3.9. Top-Down Leadership
During the pandemic, the political system of each country plays a vital role in maneuvering the nation through the pandemic. Table 11 further elaborates on Table 5, explaining
the local leadership status where P, PP, and A translate to authoritarian, flawed democracy,
and full democracy, respectively. These labels were derived from the Economist Intelligence Unit Democracy Index, which takes into account government corruption, popular
perception of citizens’ freedom of choice, public confidence in the government, and the
government’s extent of jurisdiction [34].

In Vietnam, the role of the government is very apparent as they were authoritarian in
handling the pandemic. The government is more aggressive in enforcing laws without any
delay and public debate [98]. The Vietnamese government had no problem mobilizing their
military for healthcare missions while enforcing strict restrictions publicly. In an effort to
ensure all citizens follow the social distancing and quarantine rule, Vietnam’s entrenched
system of loyal neighborhood party cadres took the liberty to spy on residents and to
report their sightings to the superior [68]. Such an authoritarian approach, also practiced
in China, has been praised by the WHO’s director general, although it seems to contravene
the organization’s constitution with respect to the “fundamental rights of every human being
without distinction” [99]. However, New Zealand, with the Democracy Index score of full
democracy, showcased excellent COVID-19 abatement. Although Kleinfield argues that
types of regime do affect a country’s success, this alone does not sufficiently contribute
to explaining the outcome [29], and the New Zealand full democracy case is definitely
worth revisiting since many scholars discovered that countries that are pro-authoritarian
can control the pandemic better.
3.10. Penalty
Table 12 outlines the compounds imposed by the seven countries for potential offenses
committed during the pandemic period. Most of the time, the amount of penalty is high to
instill fear and compliance among the public. Thus, people are more inclined to adhere to
the outlined Standard of Procedures (SOPs), consequently curbing the virus transmission
risks. As opposed to other countries, Japan did not impose any penalty on its citizens, as
summarized in Table 5. Instead, it relied heavily on the people’s obedience [61,100]. The
Japanese law prohibited the government from enforcing stringent penalties as it was formed
on the basis of the idea that human rights should be respected. This can be linked with
incidents during World War Two, wherein Japan had memories of civil rights abuse [101].
Therefore, the government can only “request” the people to minimize their movement.
Social pressure is at work as the public averts risk of bearing responsibility for spreading
the virus as they fear social sanctions [61].

3.11. Strict Lockdown Enforcement
As cases spike, many countries resort to the implementation of lockdown to contain
the virus from spreading. Table 13 shows that although most countries employed a strict
national lockdown together with public area closures (P), only some endorsed closure
of public areas and gathering bans (PP) while others practiced little to none of them
(A). Lockdown becomes more effective especially when paired up with policies of social
distancing and mandatory mask wearing. It has been proven to be a great circuit breaker
as it restricts movement and ensures safe proximity among citizens. Therefore, possibility
of a human transmission would be low, leading to lowering cumulative cases, daily case
increase, and death tolls.

In Japan, the government is incapable of enforcing lockdown due to the Japanese
Law [53]. However, an amendment was made to allow the prime minister to declare a
“state of emergency” in areas that are heavily inflicted by the virus. In addition, although
the government had called for remote working, most companies are not equipped and
prepared for such a scheme [53]. Both South Korea and Indonesia applied a national
social distancing policy instead of a national lockdown (Table 13). Localized lockdowns
are to only be implemented in highly infected areas [94,123]. However, the amount of
comprehensive rapid testing performed by South Korea set their outcomes apart. Likely
due to the poorer state of the economy, Indonesia’s response was slow and unclear, which
in the end cost the country a spike in cases.
3.12. Strict Standard of Procedure in Public Areas
Table 5 shows that most countries were coded P, with the implementation of all
SOPs except for the mask-wearing requirement (see Table 14). Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads by water droplets that can be transmitted
through air or on surfaces. The WHO suggested mask wearing as an integral strategy to
suppress transmission coupled with other policies such as social distancing, health checks
and temperature scanning in public areas, washing hands, and sterilization. Sterilization
and fumigation procedures are vital in frequently used public spaces, such as public
transportation stations, shops, and especially in infected venues. These SOPs are crucial as
they can break the virus chain if abided accordingly, hence lowering infection cases.

Japan was assigned PP although there is implementation of SOP in public areas. This
is due to the fact that these SOPs are recommended rather than enforced [53]. As stated
previously, the unique Japanese law does not allow the government to impose their citizens
with a strict law, instead only hoping that they will adhere to the measures.
3.13. Emergency Response Plans and COVID-19 Testing Policies
An emergency response plan in a pandemic situation is crucial to ensure an effective
control of the pandemic. Table 5 shows that all countries had devised their own emergency
response plan, although some may not be as rigorous as the others’. Among the popular
forms of emergency response plan are debt relief and income support by the government,
as shown in Table 15. Most countries opted for <50% lost salary coverage with a narrow
relief, applied by Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam. The Singapore government
devised a >50% salary coverage plan with a broad relief. Having a broad relief helps
decrease the citizen’s movement as they can stay home without worrying much about their
financial conditions. Restricting movement proves to be an excellent circuit breaker to the
virus transmission.

As a step towards preparing for the worst, the governments also called for the increase
of healthcare facilities by turning buildings into quarantine centers, mobilizing more labs
for testing and research purposes [60,136,143] For example, Indonesia repurposed a truck
into a laboratory to increase testing rates [84]. The South Korean and Malaysian healthcare
systems also transformed a few hospitals into special COVID-19 hospitals [23,137]; thus,
specialized healthcare workers could prioritize treating COVID-19 patients until recovery.
Moreover, COVID-19 testing policies also play a crucial role in breaking the virus
chain as the infected can be promptly identified and isolated or quarantined. Countries
with a more inclusive and comprehensive swab testing policy, which conducted open

public/mass testing covering both symptomatic and asymptomatic testing (e.g., Vietnam,
New Zealand, Malaysia, South Korea) may have a better COVID-19 abatement outcome.
On the other hand, countries (e.g., Indonesia) with limited swab testing, probably due to
the above economic or facility availability constraints, may have a COVID-19 outcome that
will become severe since many cases, especially asymptomatic ones who are also highly
infectious, go undetected.
3.14. Interaction Arena
In addition to the SES attributes described above, activities or government response
effectiveness in terms of efficient monitoring, communication, movement restriction, and
extensive contact tracing and testing were used as supplemental evidence and references
to further explain the COVID-19 abatement/severity outcome of each country. There are
three indices referred to, namely, the Government Response Stringency Index, the Health
and Containment Index, and the Economic Support Index.
New Zealand and Vietnam recorded the highest stringency score at 96, followed
by South Korea at 82, Indonesia at 80, Singapore at 76, Malaysia at 75, and Japan at
47 [18]. High stringency, composed of indicators such as school and workplace closure,
public events or gathering restriction, and international and domestic travel controls,
reflects governments’ strict policy emphasizing effective monitoring. In terms of the
results, New Zealand and Vietnam were labelled as high, while Japan was considered
low. Other countries such as Singapore, South Korea, Indonesia, and Malaysia were
considered medium.
Meanwhile, Vietnam had the highest health and containment index with a score of 85,
followed by New Zealand scoring 79, South Korea at 74, Singapore obtaining 73, Malaysia
at 71, Indonesia at 69, and finally Japan at 41 [18], where in terms of the analysis, both
Indonesia and Japan are considered low. The Containment and Health Index measures
indicators such as testing policies (PCR tests) and extent of contact tracing. Each of these
countries has varying testing policies ranging from only available to those with symptoms
and key groups to open public testing that allows even asymptomatic patients to take part,
as shown in Table 15. Despite having a policy that allows anyone to undergo swab testing,
Japan has the second lowest swab testing frequency (of 7 days average per 1000) as of
30 June at 0.03, coming second after Indonesia at 0.04. Singapore has the highest average at
1.92 followed by New Zealand at 1.31, Malaysia at 0.32, South Korea at 0.22. and lastly, no
data are available for Vietnam [18].
Looking into the statistics of the Economic Support Index, Singapore obtained the
maximum value of 100 in providing economic support to its citizens, followed by Malaysia
and Japan at 75, New Zealand at 62, South Korea at 50, and Indonesia and Vietnam at
25. The Economic Support Index illustrates the government support in terms of covering
salaries, providing direct cash payments, or universal basic income or similar for the
unemployed, freezing financial obligations such as loans and services [18].
Due to its financial capacity, Singapore is able to allocate a huge amount of money
to ease the financial burden of its citizens. This results in having a sufficient amount of
financial aid provided by the government, which lessens the need to work amidst the
pandemic. Therefore, Singaporeans are able to comply to the government rules and stay
home unless necessary. Thus, it is appropriate to say that the indices relate and have
strong dependency with each other. This scenario differs for a country with a different
economic reality. By contrast, Indonesia and Vietnam scored 25, the lowest among other
countries. Indonesia, with almost 9.6% of its population living below the national poverty
line, is unable to cater enough financial aid to each of its citizens. Its citizens working
in informal settings with low wages are left with no choice but to work, despite stay-athome restrictions [93,94].
Although financial consideration does play a big part in determining the COVID-19
abatement level of a country, it is not a major deciding factor. As seen in Table 10, Vietnam
does not have an economy as robust as Singapore and yet the former managed to mitigate

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1704

20 of 27

the virus earlier than its counterpart due to its efficient government response policy [68].
Vietnam, scoring a high tier in both the Government Stringency Index and the Health
and Containment Index entails its government with strong leadership presence, with
strict monitoring and efficient communication skill, as well as a comprehensive contact
tracing policy [51,111,131]. Hence, citizens are well informed and possible cases can be
mitigated before emerging into a deadly cluster. Despite having the lowest score among
the other countries in the Economic Support Index, Vietnam is compensated by its strong
government response policy. A similar scenario could be seen in New Zealand, with a
financial capacity significantly lower than others. Although scoring only 62, New Zealand
successfully lowered its COVID-19 cases and mortality rate approaching 30 June 2020, as
seen in Table 5.
Therefore, it can be deduced that the level of COVID-19 abatement can be rather
directly justified by the scores reflected in the Government Stringency Index and the Health
and Containment Index. Countries scoring a high score in these indices generally have
a high cumulative score, as shown in Table 5 (Vietnam and New Zealand). Meanwhile,
countries with significantly lower scores in both indices had a low success rate in abating
the virus. This is prominently seen in Japan, which scored low in both indices. Despite
being in the medium tier in providing economic support, Japan is still struggling to control
the number of COVID-19 cases in its country.
4. Conclusions and Recommendations
Much effort has been focused on pharmaceutical aspects in combating the COVID-19
pandemic; thus, in recognizing the gap and the need in exploring non-pharmaceutical
interventions and strategies in stemming the transmission risk, this diagnostic study’s
primary objective was to explain COVID-19 severity from an SES perspective, hence testing
out the framework’s adaptability in the non-commons or health context. Through the
SES analytical framework providing a theoretical basis, we reviewed seven Asia-Pacific
countries for institutional–social–ecological factors that affect their success in fighting the
pandemic. Probably due to adherence to, or the high presence (P) frequency of, the design
principles, which subsequently reflect the high level of the Government Stringency Index
and the Health and Containment Index, both Vietnam and New Zealand were classified
as countries with the high success level of COVID-19 abatement, which is coherently
explainable. Meanwhile, Japan and Indonesia, with low presence of (P) frequency or with
the high presence of (A), were deemed as countries with the low success level.
However, although some countries possessed a high number of Ps for SES attributes,
the outcome signified that some countries (e.g., South Korea and Singapore) with the
intermediate level of success may not effectively abate the pandemic in comparison with
what has been hypothesized. Thus, two lessons can be drawn: (i) having high number of Ps
for SES attributes does not always mean a panacea for the pandemic; however, it would be
detrimental to a country if it lacks them severely, and (ii) some attributes (mostly from the
governance factor) may carry higher weightage towards explaining the success level. More
precisely, the critical success factors/design principles found in Vietnam and New Zealand
are ultimately about the strict implementation of lockdown, penalties, high trust level
of citizens towards government, highly adequate and efficient mobilized facilities, and
comprehensive COVID-19 testing policy. The economic situation of a country does play
a vital role in keeping the pandemic under control, but Vietnam demonstrated otherwise
or is an “anomaly” in handling their COVID-19 situation, given its status as a lower
middle-income nation by the World Bank. Meanwhile, low success outcome countries,
such as Japan and Indonesia, seemingly are associated with the lack of national lockdown
implementation and low testing rates, and specifically in Indonesia, it failed probably due
to its economic situation, inadequate facilities and resources, and manpower to contain the
pandemic. Other factors, such as population density, social homogeneity, past experience
and knowledge in managing an infectious disease, and local leadership regimes, are not as
impactful and significant as the above factors.

By understanding the overview of SES attributes in relation to COVID-19 and identifying which are potentially the most significant ones, this comparative study, via the SES
methodical coding framework, provides knowledge and best practice exchange between
the seven countries, shedding light on how to leverage these critical institutional–social–
ecological attributes so that more strategic policy guide and coordinated measures for
effective country preparedness and response in terms of managing and addressing the
current and the future health crisis can be devised.
Despite the above insights and contribution, this study with a rather small number of
case studies was, however, limited to secondary data and literature reviews, which were
primarily analyzed in a qualitative descriptive manner. Meaning that information and
conclusion (i.e., indicative patterns of significant SES attributes for COVID-19 abatement)
drawn from this study may not entirely be generalizable to other countries’ in curbing
COVID-19 and do not provide absolute quantitative accuracy. Therefore, for further validation of the existing SES attributes in terms of how applicable and valid these factors
are determining the COVID-19 severity level, future studies may consider extending the
SES framework application to include more geographical regions and countries. In addition, focusing on the inclusion of higher-tier SES attributes and exploration of other
non-pharmaceutical factors, cross-sectional studies via the public perception survey coupled with robust inferential statistical analyses for more accurate explanation and prediction
of the pandemic outcome are necessary.
