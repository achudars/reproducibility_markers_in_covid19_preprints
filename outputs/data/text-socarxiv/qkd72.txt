Abstract
This study aimed to investigate the instructor’s electronic feedback practices during the COVID
19 Pandemic in terms of the nature of the content of e-feedback, the formulation, the challenges,
and the multimodal nature of the instructor’s e-feedback. This study used a qualitative case study
to obtain data from the instructor’s e-feedback in three linguistic courses as delivered, practiced
by the single English language instructor. The instructor’s e-feedback via Blackboard and
WhatsApp platform and the follow-up interview were analyzed qualitatively. The findings
indicate that (1) the highest number of instructor’s e-feedback focused on global issues as
compared to local issues, (2) the instructor composed his e-feedback in the form of eight main
categories: explanations, suggestions, clarifications, questioning, repetitions, statements, praises,
and commands, (3) the instructor used more screencasts for providing e-feedback, followed by
written and audio modes respectively. The thematic analysis (4) revealed the instructor’s positive
impression on providing e-feedback through these interactive modes (written, audio, and
screencast) and a range of challenging issues such as students’ preference issues, technical
issues, timing issues, financial and areal issues. This study is significant because it provides us
with a comprehensive picture of the patterns of the feedback content, the formulation of the efeedback, the multimodality of the instructor's e-feedback, and the significant issues that
emerged from the instructor's e-feedback practices. However, further research should include a
relative group of instructors to determine the impact of e-feedback on learners.

Introduction
The outbreak of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic presents significant challenges
for societies worldwide, with significant and complicated implications for higher education
institutions, primarily in the field of English language learning and teaching (Draissi & Yong,
2020). During the outbreak of the COVID-19 Pandemic and beyond, the direct shift to online
education has fully emerged as an inevitable option in all schools and universities (Bao, 2020;
Basilaia & Kvavadze 2020). A fully online course usually requires an extensive design of the
lesson plan, instructional tools such as audio and video content, and technical support teams
(Bao, 2020).
Instructors, regardless of their level of experience and training, generally find it
challenging to produce and deliver clear, helpful, and timely feedback and actively engage
learners with it (Stern & Solomon, 2006; Lunt & Curran, 2010). The integration of technology in
the education system has broadened the way instructors provide electronic feedback (e-feedback)
to their second/foreign language learners. Computer and human generated-mediated feedback
can be delivered electronically, synchronously, and asynchronously (Ene & Upton, 2014, 2018;
Goldstein, 2006). Generally, instructor feedback has conceived as information provided in a
dialogic way by an instructor to the learners (Saeed & Qunayeer, 2020). Recent studies have
emphasized the need for e-feedback due to its effectiveness (AbuSeileek & Abualsha'r, 2014;
Ene & Upton, 2018; Henderson, Ryan, & Phillips, 2019; Lunt & Curran, 2010; Chang, Kelly,
Satar & Strobl, 2017).
Instructors are increasingly relying on various electronic tools in providing e-feedback to
their students, Google Docs (Alharbi, 2019; Saeed & Qunayeer 2020), screencasts (Bakla, 2020;
Cunningham, 2019; Tseng & Yeh, 2019), track changes in the word processor (AbuSeileek, &
Abualsha’r, 2014), WhatsApp (Susanti & Tarmuji, 2016); Microsoft word and screencast
(Cavaleri, Kawaguchi, Di Biase & Power, 2019). However, providing feedback is a complex
process; instructors need to determine if revisions are required for content or organization (Elola
& Oskoz, 2016).
Studies that explored the written and audio-visual e-feedback have received little
attention (Mahoney, Macfarlane, & Ajjawi, 2019). However, instructors are the ones who
determine how to use the e-feedback; instructors’ e-feedback has been so scarcely studied (Ene
& Upton, 2018). It suggests that instructors’ e-feedback needs to be explored in terms of the
patterns of instructors’ e-feedback during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The study is significant
because it provides us with a comprehensive picture of patterns of the feedback content, the
formulation of the e-feedback, the multimodality of the instructor's e-feedback, and the issues
that emerged from the instructor's e-feedback practices. With the growing use of distance
learning in teaching and learning of English language during the COVID-19 Pandemic, this
study seeks to answer the following questions:
(1) What is the nature of content issues addressed via the instructor’s e-feedback in the three
linguistic courses?
(2) In what ways does the instructor formulate the e-feedback in the three linguistic courses?
(3) What is the multimodal nature of instructor e-feedback in the three linguistic courses?

(4) What are the significant issues that emerged from the instructor's e-feedback practices in the
three linguistics courses?
More specifically, this case study presents findings of an analysis of one instructor’s efeedback given in three linguistic courses (sociolinguistics, phonetics, historical linguistics) in
terms of the nature of content issues addressed via instructor’s e-feedback, the formulation of the
e-feedback, the multimodal nature of instructor's e-feedback and the significant issues emerged
from the instructor's e-feedback practices.
Literature Review
Theoretical Framework
E-feedback has grounded on Vygotsky’s (1978) sociocultural theory. The sociocultural
theory sees feedback to be critical, and yet given that feedback is seen as a process of interaction
between instructors and learners (Lantolf, 2006). Vygotsky’s concept of scaffolding covers how
feedback is delivered through the dialogue between instructor and learner. Aljaafreh and Lantolf
(1994) classified some features of effective scaffolding in a second language context to help
instructors provide effective scaffolding. They suggested that scaffolded assistance should be
offered when needed and removed immediately as the student can perform the task, provided
according to changing proficiency needs of the learner, and; must be given in conversational
interaction; both instructor and student must be actively involved.
Instructor feedback is a kind of scaffold when it is offered dialogically and constructively
to the learners (Alharbi, 2019). Instructors' feedback is also known as a scaffolding mechanism
in which instructors support language learners to recognize the several issues and errors in their
tasks (Hyland & Hyland, 2006). E-feedback is known as computer-mediated corrective feedback
and technology-supported feedback refers to feedback that is conveyed using various
technological tools (Ene & Upton 2014; Saeed & Qunayeer, 2020).
Supportive Technological Tools of E-feedback in an Online Environment
Electronically providing e-feedback on student tasks via various electronic devices has
become popular among language instructors, particularly in university contexts (Ene & Upton,
2014; Hyland & Hyland, 2006; Saeed & Ghazali, 2019; Saeed & Qunayeer, 2020). The
multimodal options for e-feedback have developed from written to audio, video, and screencast
feedback on foreign and second language (Chang et al., 2017). Language instructors have a wide
range of new ways of developing and providing language learners with e-feedback, such as
Google Docs (Alharbi, 2019; Neumann & Kopcha, 2019; Saeed & Qunayeer, 2020). These
studies suggest that Google Docs can serve as an effective channel for instructor-learner and
learner-learner interactions.
Other studies reported other ways for providing e-feedback such as Blackboard LMS (Ai,
2017; Basabrin, 2019), Wiki and Facebook (Demirbilek, 2015); blogs (Arslan, 2013; Dippold,
2009; Yaku & Aydın, 2015), WhatsApp (Susanti & Tarmuji, 2016), track changes (AbuSeileek,
& Abualsha'r, 2014), discussion boards (Guasch, Espasa, & Martinez-Melo, 2018; London,
2019).

Innovative Practices in Instructor E-feedback

AbuSa’aleek & Shariq

Previous research on instructor e-feedback Ali (2016); Elola & Oskoz (2016); Harper,
Green & Fernandez-Toro (2018); and Orlando (2016) has focused on providing e-feedback via
screencast. The majority of instructors valued multimodal screencast as more detailed lends itself
to higher-level conceptual issues (Orlando, 2016), promoted more informal and supportive
communication (Borup, West, & Thomas, 2015), more time-efficient, and promoting quality
(Henderson & Phillips, 2015).
Bakla (2020) provided e-feedback via a three-format, namely screencasts, a free audio
add-on (Kaizena), Written Feedback as marginal comments. The SL learners did not favor a
particular feedback mode, but they highlighted the potential benefits and drawbacks of each
mode.
Audio feedback has proven to be favored by both instructors and students. Instructors
delivered e-feedback via recording audio to their students’ tasks on global issues rather than local
concerns since the audio mode explains macro-level issues more freely compared with written
comments (Cavanaugh & Song, 2014).
Additionally, Cavanaugh and Song (2014) reported that lack of training in using audio in
distance class generated challenges in delivering e-feedback. Higher word counts generated via
audio feedback, and more comments made for explaining misunderstanding, giving praise,
showing good practice and justification marks (Chalmers, MacCallum, Mowat, & Fulton, 2014);
providing audio feedback was found to be more detailed, supportive, and personalized compared
to the written feedback (Gould & Day, 2013).
There are also other studies (Alvarez, Espasa, & Guasch, 2012; Cavaleri et al., 2019;
Elola & Oskoz, 2016; Ene & Upton, 2014; Harper et al., 2018) that illustrated the various
patterns of instructors’ e-feedback. Shariq (2020) reported that the active use of corrective
feedback improves learners’ perception and attitudes towards the English language skills.
Cavaleri et al. (2019) employed directive, suggestion, explanation, model, question, praise, and
interpersonal feedback. Alharbi (2019) reported five types of e-feedback; question, statement,
suggestion, directive, and correction; suggestions, explanations, examples, and advice (Harper et
al., 2018), suggestions, clarifications, statements, praises, and commands (Elola & Oskoz, 2016),
directive, explicit, principled and systematic (Ene & Upton, 2014), suggestions and questions
(Alvarez et al., 2012).
Methods
The present study used a qualitative case study which is “an intensive, holistic description
and analysis of a single entity, phenomenon, or social unit” (Merriam 1988, p. 16), to obtain data
that enriches our understanding of the instructor e-feedback in three linguistic courses as
delivered, practiced by the English language instructor.
Settings and Participants
The study was conducted in the college of sciences and arts, Methnab, Qassim
University, Saudi Arabia. The instructor holds a Ph.D. degree in linguistics; he has been teaching
English and Linguistics for eight years. The instructor exchanges e-feedback with third-year
university students at the Department of English and Translation. Their ages range from 21-23

years old. As far as the number of students is concerned, there were (14) students enrolled in
Sociolinguistics, (12) in Historical Linguistics, and (25) in Phonetics.
In the current study, the same instructor taught all of the three linguistic courses, namely:
Sociolinguistics (ENG-365); Phonetics (ENG-354); Historical Linguistics (ENG-358), during the
second semester in 2019-2020 academic year. The instructor and the students belong to different
cultural backgrounds. Hence, the instructor, a native speaker of the Urdu language, whereas all
of the participants were English learners whose first language was Arabic.
After the Pandemic began to spread in the Kingdom, the online teaching sessions started
in March 2020 which ended in May 2020. Thus, the online teaching sessions ran for six weeks
(three hours a week). The electronic platform was the only solution for the academic and other
different activities during the outbreak of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic.
All three linguistics courses were delivered using Blackboard, a learning management
system. The instructor determined some delivery changes and created three WhatsApp groups
for exchanging the e-feedback due to the restricted time of online classes. The students feel
comfortable asking questions, clarifications, and exchanging e-feedback with their instructor in
the WhatsApp group. The instructor synchronically as well as asynchronically provided efeedbacks through Blackboard, WhatsApp and e-mail platforms, and he played an important role
as a facilitator, source and provider of the e-feedback.
Data Collection and Analysis
The study used two types of data: instructor e-feedback practices and semi-structured
interviews. The data was obtained from the three WhatsApp groups, e-mail, and Blackboard
platform. The data obtained from instructor e-feedback in the three linguistic courses, namely:
Sociolinguistics (ENG-365) which covers the topics related to the relationship between language
and society; Phonetics (ENG-354) which enables students to understand, describe and use all
segmental and suprasegmental features of English and Historical Linguistics (ENG-358) which
introduces students to the nature of language change during the second semester in the 20192020 academic year.
The instructor delivered e-feedback via three modes (written, audio, and screencast) in
the form of written feedback via WhatsApp messages, Blackboard chat-box and posts, and emails; audio feedbacks include WhatsApp voice messages and blackboard sessions; while
screencast feedbacks include Blackboard sessions conducted for online classes.
The data were analyzed using a qualitative analysis. The data of instructor e-feedback
was analyzed in terms of its types, content, and delivery mode. The instructor's e-feedback type
was categorized as the feedback provided (i.e., explanations, suggestions, clarifications,
questioning, repetitions, statements, praises, or commands). The instructor’s delivery mode of
the feedback was categorized as (written, audio, and screencast), whereas the content of efeedback was categorized as (global vs. local issues).
The instructor also participated in a semi-structured interview that was guided by a set of
open-ended questions. These questions addressed the issues related to the instructor's experience

in online teaching, his preference for delivery mode, and how it affected the way he constructs
the feedback, content of e-feedback, type of e-feedback as well as challenging issues emerging
from instructor e-feedback practices. Finally, categories mentioned above of instructor efeedback were measured using a simple quantitative analysis, including the number and
percentage of each category.
Findings
This section presents the findings obtained from this case study into three main
conceptual themes: the nature of content issues addressed via instructor e-feedback, patterns of
constructing the instructor e-feedback, and the multimodal nature of instructor e-feedback. In
addition, four themes emerged from the thematic analysis of the interview.
The Nature of Content Issues Addressed via Instructor E-feedback
Based on the qualitative analysis of instructor e-feedback, the instructor uses WhatsApp
messages, Blackboard chat-box, posts, screencasts, and e-mail for teaching linguistic courses and
exchanging e-feedback with his students. The analysis of the instructor’s e-feedback indicates
that he exchanged e-feedback focusing on various content issues in linguistic courses. The
qualitative study that started on the foci of feedback revealed that the different electronic
platforms such as; Blackboard and WhatsApp helped the instructor to target issues in students’
activities in the three linguistic courses at the global and local levels. The instructor e-feedback
concentrated on global (content, structure, and organization) and local issues (vocabulary and
grammar).
As shown in Table one, the nature of content issues played an important role in
promoting instructor–learner e-feedback exchange in the three linguistic courses. In other words,
the quantification of the instructor e-feedback exchanged via Blackboard and WhatsApp presents
a fascinating insight into the intensive engagement of the instructor and the learners in feedback
on linguistic courses. The instructor provided a of total 402 e-feedback comments on the three
linguistic courses; sociolinguistics, phonetics, and historical linguistics, via Blackboard and
WhatsApp.
First, the findings show that the instructor e-feedback addressing global issues (313,
78%) in students’ activities in the three linguistic courses, such as content, structure, and
organization, outnumbered the feedback focusing on local issues such as vocabulary and
grammar (89, 22%). Therefore, most of the instructor e-feedback concentrates on global issues.
Second, the below instructor e-feedback exchanges (402 total) were also quantified to
determine the amount and percentage of e-feedback exchanged in each linguistic course. The
findings show that among the three linguistic courses, the instructor provided the highest number
of e-feedback in Phonetics (206, 51%), (163, 41%) of which focused on global issues. In contrast
(43, 11%) focused on local issues in phonetics.
Furthermore, this is followed by sociolinguistics in which the instructor provided a total
number of (100, 25%) e-feedback distributed as global issues (75, 19%) and local issues (25,
6%). Finally, the Historical linguistic got the lowest e-feedback provided by the instructor as

indicated by the total number of instructor e-feedback (96, 24%) that focused on global (75,
19%) and local issues in Historical Linguistics (21, 5%).
The above findings indicate that the highest number of instructor e-feedback focused on
global issues compared to local issues in all three linguistic courses. This means that due to the
type and the content of the linguistic courses, instructor and learners tended to focus on global
issues.

Patterns of Constructing the Instructor E-feedback
The qualitative analysis of the instructor e-feedback shows that the instructor composed
his e-feedback in the form of eight main categories: explanations, suggestions, clarifications,
questioning, repetitions, statements, praises, and commands. As Table three illustrates,
quantification of the way instructor e-feedback presents a fascinating insight into the various
ways used by the instructor in replying to the comments of his students across the three linguistic
courses. The findings also show that among the three linguistic courses, the instructor
constructed the highest number of e-feedback in Phonetics (206, 51%), followed by (100, 25%)
in Sociolinguistics and finally (96, 24%) e-feedback in Historical Linguistic.
It is evident that explanations scored as the most frequently e-feedback formulated by
the instructor (68, 17%), followed by commands (57, 14%), questioning (56, 14%), repetitions
(55, 14%), praises (52, 13%), clarifications (47, 12%), suggestions (42, 10%) and finally
statements (25, 6%).
This finding clarifies how the instructor constructed and varied his e-feedback
according to the nature of the issue(s) provided by the students in the three linguistic courses.
The way the instructor composes the e-feedback plays a role in creating opportunities for
instructor-learner collaboration.

The second part of the assignment deals with the transcription of Arabic
text which you did not do carefully. You need to work more on Arabic
fricative sounds.
If you compare these Arabic sounds concerning articulation, you will
more clearly know how they are different.
Let me clarify your mistake.
English loanword in Arabic is cream, not ‘sukkar.’
Before I move to the next topic, can you tell me the difference between
accent and dialect?
Your answer is partially correct. Let me explain to you again; Historical
linguistics deals with language change over time, or we can say language
development, while the History of linguistics deals with the development
of linguistics.
Bilingualism is a language policy which enforces the status of a language
as a national or official language. False statement
Well done! Keep it up!
Transcribe the five sentences the way you transcribed the words given in
previous chapters.

The Multimodal Nature of Instructor E-feedback
The mode of delivery; written, audio, and screencast e-feedback via the electronic
platforms like Blackboard and WhatsApp used by the instructor to deliver the feedback to
students is another finding of the qualitative analysis of the instructor e-feedback, which indicate
that the instructor uses a variety of providing e-feedback in the three linguistic courses. The
instructor provided a total number of 402 e-feedback comments via three different modalities,
written, audio, and screencast, as Table five illustrates, on the three linguistic courses;
sociolinguistics, phonetics, and historical linguistics via Blackboard and WhatsApp.

First, the findings illustrate that the instructor provided screencasts e-feedback (207,
52%) in students’ activities in the three linguistic courses, outnumbered the e-feedback offered
by written e-feedback (102, 25%) and audio e-feedback (93, 23%). Therefore, most of the
instructor's amount of e-feedback was offered via screencast across the three linguistic courses.
Second, the delivery mode used by the instructor to provide e-feedback exchanges (total
402) was also quantified to determine the occurrences and percentage of the amount of the
instructor e-feedback offered through written, audio and screencast modes in the three linguistic
courses. The findings show that among the three linguistic courses, the instructor provided the
highest number of screencast e-feedback in Phonetics (108, 27%), followed by (54, 13%)
screencast e-feedback in Sociolinguistics and (45, 11%) screencast e-feedback in Historical
Linguistics. Written e-feedback was more frequent in Phonetics (50, 12%), whereas written efeedback occurred less frequently in the Sociolinguistics (28, 7%) and (24, 6%) in Historical
Linguistics.
Finally, audio e-feedback was more frequently provided by the instructor in the Phonetics
(48, 12%), whereas (27, 7%) were communicated via audio e-feedback in Historical Linguistic.
The lowest e-feedback provided via audio e-feedback indicated by the total number of instructor
audio e-feedback (93, 23%) was in Sociolinguistics (18, 4%).

The above findings indicate that the highest number of instructor delivery modes of
providing e-feedback was through screencasts mode, followed by written and audio modes,
respectively. The fact that screencast e-feedback appeared to be favor interactivity more than
written and audio e-feedback because screencasts have interactivity features such as a
combination of graphics, text, voice, mouse movements, annotations, and highlighting.
Moreover, the provided screencasts e-feedback appeared to give detailed commentary.
Therefore, the instructor may have found it relatively easy and interactive to use screencasts
mode rather than written and audio modes. Thus, the screencast is categorized as an innovative
feedback mode for use in language classes.
Findings of the Qualitative Analysis of the Interview
The researcher conducted this semi-structured interview to identify the significant issues
that emerged from the instructor's e-feedback practices in the three linguistics courses. The
researcher adopts a qualitative approach and thematic analysis to gain insight into the instructor's
perspective. Furthermore, the following four themes emerged from the thematic analysis of the
interview: instructor’s experiences in online teaching, instructor’s perception and impression of
using Blackboard and WhatsApp platforms in providing e-feedback, valuing of e-feedback
practices, and challenging concerns arising from instructor e-feedback practices.

Innovative Practices in Instructor E-feedback

AbuSa’aleek & Shariq

First Theme: Instructor’s Experience in Online Teaching
The first interview question was asked about the instructor’s experiences in online
teaching. He stated, ‘‘I attended several online training programs on online teaching using
‘blackboard collaborate ultra’ organized by the University that helped me a lot’’. He added ‘‘I
have a good experience in using computer applications’’.
Second Theme: Instructor’s Perception towards Using Blackboard and WhatsApp platforms in
Providing E-feedback
The instructor stated, “At the beginning of the task, the teaching and providing efeedback online via Blackboard and WhatsApp was challenging for me. However, it became
easier as I became engaged in doing so.” He also added, “It was a wonderful way to provide efeedback through these interactive modes that contain great tools”. He stated that “There are
several useful options such as; live sessions, screencast, chat-box, discussion forum, evaluation,
etc. in blackboard program that make teaching and providing e-feedback interesting and easy”
and “The use of WhatsApp and e-mails is not new to us, but they also play a great role in sharing
written messages, voice messages, videos, and images, etc.”
Third theme: Valuing of e-feedback practices
The instructor expressed his preference and how the various delivery modes: written,
audio, and screencast, affected the way he constructed the e-feedback on the local and global
issues. The instructor stated, “The screencast mode is preferable, of course, as it covers other
modes as well. We can share the screen, comment section, PowerPoint presentation, and ebooks. This mode provides audio-visual feedback with more detail to the students”. He also
stated, “The content of e-feedback depends more on the type of courses. Since these courses are
different from skill courses, the feedback on global issues becomes more important rather than
the local issues. Though, the serious local issues cannot be ignored as well”.
Fourth Theme: Challenging Concerns Arising from Instructor E-feedback Practices
The instructor reported various challenging issues emerging from instructor e-feedback
practices. They are discussed under the following sub-themes.
Students’ Preference Issues
The instructor showed some challenging concerns regarding the students’ preferences
while providing e-feedback. He asked the students about their preferences, and their answers
vary based on delivery mode from written, audio to screencasts. Therefore, the instructor decided
to use a mix of delivery modes in providing e-feedback that may suit the majority of the students.
He stated, “I used a variety of delivery modes: written, audio, and screencasts; while providing efeedback to meet the preference of a large majority of the learners.”
Technical Issues
The instructor reported that the technical issues faced by both the learners and the
instructor hinder the providing and receiving e-feedback. The instructor stated, “Technical
issues such as weak internet connection, unsupported file type, failure of microphone, speakers
and camera, the large size of video files, unsupported documents, technological awareness
hindered the providing and receiving e-feedback effectively.”

Timing Issues
The instructor reported challenges regards concerning the timing of providing and
receiving e-feedback. He said that he could not offer immediate (timely) feedback based on the
learners’ needs. The instructor stated, “As there was no fixed time for the students’ queries, some
students were sending questions, messages late at night which made the situation difficult to
respond at the same time.”
Financial and Areal Issues
The instructor showed challenging concerns regarding the students’ financial background
and the place they are living. He said, “Some students with low financial background face the
difficulty with managing computers, laptops, modern mobile devices and the internet expenses.”
Discussion
The present study was carried out in responding to the challenging issues in instructor efeedback and the gaps highlighted in recent empirical studies surrounding the instructor efeedback practices (Elola & Oskoz, 2016; Ene & Upton, 2018; Mahoney et al., 2019). This study
contributes to existing research by identifying the nature of content issues addressed via the
instructor’s e-feedback (global vs. local issues), presenting insight into the various ways used by
the instructor in composing the e-feedback, the multimodal nature of the instructor's e-feedback,
and the significant issues emerged from the instructor's e-feedback practices. This case study
presented significant findings indicating that the exploitation of various electronic tools to
provide e-feedback on student tasks supported the instructor's e-feedback practices.
The findings of this study confirm the results of other studies in terms of the nature of
content issues addressed via the instructor’s e-feedback on both global and local issues. The
findings show that the instructor’s e-feedback addressing global issues in the three linguistic
courses outnumbered the feedback focusing on local issues. The feedback on global issues
becomes essential rather than the local issues. However, the severe local issues cannot be ignored
(Alharbi, 2019; Cavanaugh & Song, 2014; Elola & Oskoz, 2016; Saeed & Qunayeer, 2020).
Cavanaugh and Song (2014) found that instructors provide more e-feedback on global
issues than local issues. E-feedback directed to global issues tended to generate more interaction
(Saeed & Qunayeer, 2020). The instructor provided more comments on global issues via
screencast and fewer comments via written e-feedback (Elola & Oskoz, 2016); Screencasts offer
more explanations on global issues (Bakla, 2020; Orlando, 2016; Cunningham, 2019; Silva,
2012). Video feedback was used to discuss the global issues while local issues were discussed
via written feedback in Microsoft Word (Silva, 2012).
The finding of the present study presents a fascinating insight into the various ways used
by the instructor in composing/ formulating his e-feedback in the form of eight main categories:
explanations, suggestions, clarifications, questioning, repetitions, statements, praises, and
commands. This finding also supports the finding of a few other studies regarding the effective
formulation of instructor e-feedback (Cunningham, 2017; Guasch et al., 2018; Elola & Oskoz,
2016; Harper et al., 2018; Saeed & Qunayeer, 2020). The various types of instructor e-feedback
encourage instructor–learner interaction, as learners need to react to these feedback types (Saeed
& Qunayeer, 2020).

AbuSa’aleek & Shariq

Other categories have emerged from instructor e-feedback such as directive, model,
question, suggestion, explanation, praise, and interpersonal commands were all influenced by the
instructor’s perception of the learners’ individual needs and personalities (Cavaleri et al., 2019;
Elola & Oskoz, 2016). Questions and suggestions lead to more students’ engagement as this
form of e-feedback encourages them to respond actively (Guasch et al., 2018).
However, the ways the instructor formulated and varied his e-feedback according to the
nature of the issue(s) plays an essential role in creating opportunities for instructor-learner
collaboration. The in-depth explanation is provided via screencasts e-feedback (Alharbi, 2017),
video feedback contains explanations, suggestions, and praise (Cavaleri et al., 2019). In this
regard, the instructors employed suggestions, explanations, more examples and provided advice
about the structure via screencast compared to written feedback mode (Cunningham, 2017;
Harper et al., 2018). This study also contributes to earlier research. Our findings on the
multimodal nature of instructor e-feedback suggest that screencast e-feedback appeared to favor
interactivity more than written and audio e-feedback because screencasts have interactivity
features such as a combination of graphics, text, voice, mouse movements, annotations, and
highlighting.
This finding agrees with some previous research on the multimodal nature of instructor efeedback (Alvira, 2016; Elola & Oskoz, 2016; Harper et al., 2018; Ghosn-Chelala & Al-Chibani,
2018). Screencasting encouraged the instructor to deliver more detailed feedback and
explanation than written and audio e-feedback (Ghosn-Chelala & Al-Chibani, 2018).
Due to its multimodality, screencasting can enhance students’ uptake of e-feedback. The
use of written, oral feedback is widely accepted by students, and the use of screencasting is
promising (Alvira, 2016; Stannard, 2008). Bakla (2020), in this regard, reports that the highest
number of correct revisions was made via audio mode compared to written or screencast, and the
EFL learner highlighted the potential benefits and disadvantages of each mode. The instructors
and learners valued multimodal screencast as more detailed (Harper, Harper, Green, &
Fernandez-Toro, 2012; Orlando, 2016; Silva, 2012), whereas the audio feedback is efficient,
practical, more detailed than written feedback (Lunt & Curran, 2010).
The interview analysis revealed a range of challenging issues such as students’ preference
issues, technical issues, timing issues, financial and areal issues. Although the various
technological tools of e-feedback in the online environment support and facilitate the instructor’s
e-feedback practices, it sometimes poses challenges for the instructor and the learners. This
finding is in agreement with (Alharbi, 2019; Cavanaugh & Song, 2014; Henderson et al. 2019),
lack of skills, internet connection and formatting issues (Alharbi, 2019), feedback practices,
contextual constraints, and individual capacity (Henderson et al. 2019), instructors' training
(Cavanaugh & Song, 2014).
Conclusion
The present study was carried out in responding to the challenging issues in instructor efeedback and the gaps highlighted in recent empirical studies surrounding the instructor efeedback practices. The present study found that the instructor’s e-feedback more focused on
global issues as compared to local issues. The instructor composed his e-feedback in the form of

eight main categories such as explanations, suggestions, clarifications, questioning, repetitions,
statements, praises, and commands, the instructor used more screencasts for providing efeedback, followed by written and audio modes respectively. Furthermore, a range of
challenging issues such as students’ preference issues, technical issues, timing issues, financial
and areal issues have emerged from the thematic analysis. The present study has several
implications for EFL instructors. This analysis of instructor e-feedback has enabled us to have a
comprehensive picture of the nature of content issues addressed via the instructor’s e-feedback.
How do the instructors formulate/construct their e-feedback electronically, and the various
significant issues that emerged from the instructor's e-feedback practices. The ways the
instructor prepared and varied his e-feedback according to the nature of the issue(s) play an
essential role in creating opportunities for instructor-learner collaboration. In turn, this
collaboration leads to engagement and successful revision.
In this view, instructors need to consider the learners’ individual preferences and need
concerning the delivery mode from written, audio to screencasts to help them respond, negotiate
and address the e-feedback effectively. Furthermore, the instructors need to consider the various
challenging issues that may emerge from the instructor's e-feedback practices.
This study also addresses several limitations that need to be addressed in future
investigations. First, this case study is based on analyzing one instructor’s e-feedback in three
linguistics courses that might have affected our findings. Therefore, future research should
include a relative group of instructors’ e-feedback. Second, this study involved only the
analyzing one instructor's e-feedback delivered via Blackboard and WhatsApp platforms.
Therefore, future studies are recommended to investigate the use of other electronic platforms
and explore how EFL learners respond to the instructors' e-feedback and their perception of the
e-feedback.
