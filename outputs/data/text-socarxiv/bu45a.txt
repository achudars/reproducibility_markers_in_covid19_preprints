"4" "Abstract"
"5" "Global crises provide a fertile environment for the proliferation of  disinformation, rumors, and conspiracy narratives.  Geopolitical actors can take the opportunity to disseminate self-serving theses and undermine the efforts of governments to fight a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.  Romania is one of the most pro-Wes tern countries in Eastern Europe, but its population is not immune to disinformation originating from anti-Western actors."
"6" "We investigate people's perceptions and beliefs related to COVID-19 in Romania, during the lockdown period (April 2020) and during th e state of alert period (July 2020), by fielding two surveys with different modes of collection (CATI and web). Building on measures tested in other countries, we identify the public’s vulnerability to conspiracy narratives and its willingness to comply wi th public health guidance. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we check if individuals exhibiting pro-Russian or anti-Western attitudes believe more strongly in COVID-19 conspiracy narratives compared to the rest of the population. Then, we check if those  believing conspiracy narratives are less susceptible to comply with public health recommendations."
"7" "We find in both surveys that holding conspiracy beliefs is a mediator between distrusting Western actors and noncompliance with COVID-19 guidelines. Thus, pr o-Russian and anti-EU, U.S. and NATO attitudes are linked to stronger conspiracy beliefs, which relate to lower levels of concern and knowledge regarding the virus, which in turn can reduce compliance with guidelines. This suggests that openness to anti-We stern narratives may have behavioral consequences. These findings highlight the potential sources of unsafe behaviors during the pandemic and can inform official communication strategies meant to counter both disinformation and noncompliance with public he alth policies."

"9" "Research Premises"
"10" "As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, more aspects related to public opinion and perception o f the disease start to gain focus. The public’s attitude remains essential to the management of this significant public health crisis, and special attention has to be given to the connection between acceptance of medical advice and belief in conspiracy the ories."
"11" "In the last years, growing emphasis has been placed on the issue of conspiracy theories gaining public support during significant crises or after shocking or traumatizing public events. An increasing body of literature has emerged, focusing mainly o n the psychological causes of endorsing conspiracy theories and also on the effects of these beliefs on individual behaviors."
"12" "The actual term used to describe this phenomenon has been fluid and several authors in the fields of social psychology, sociology,  political science have used various designations for it – from the more general “conspiracy theories” (Goertzel, 1994; Douglas, Sutton, & Cichoka, 2017), to “conspiracy mentality” (Imhoff & Bruder, 2014), “conspiracy worldview” (Freeman & Bentall, 2017),  “conspiracy mindset” (Imhoff & Bruder, 2014; Sutton & Douglas, 2020), “false conspiracy theories” (Sunstein & Vermeule, 2009), “conspiracy beliefs” (Allington & Dhavan, 2020), “conspiracist ideation” (Lewandowsky, Gignac, & Oberauer, 2013), “conspiracy thi nking” (Uscinsky et al, 2020). Some authors use the terms in an interchanging manner, others opt for precisely defined formulations, but they all refer to the same phenomenon – broadly defined as a set of alternative explanations, bearing no relation to ac tual facts and historical or scientific causes of events, but centered on alleged actions by powerful elites acting in the shadow and manipulating major events for self-serving purposes. We prefer to refer to “conspiracy beliefs” and “conspiracy narratives ” in the context of the COVID-19 crisis."
"13" "Previous research results show that people tend to turn to conspiracy explanations in times of great societal pressure because they satisfy several psychological needs, such as epistemic, existential or social need s (Douglas, Sutton, & Cichoka, 2017). These alternative stories fulfill needs for knowledge, control or having positive self-image, respectively, that official explanations, often complex, abstract or incomplete, cannot satisfy: “a conspiracy theory gives  believers someone tangible to blame for their perceived predicament, instead of blaming it on impersonal or abstract social forces” (Goertzel, 2010, p. 493). In some cases, either the difficulty to actually distinguish official/science-based explanations f rom other sources of information (Van Bavel et al, 2020), or „crippled epistemology” (Sunstein & Vermeule, 2009, p. 204), which refers to a scarcity of sources of information, can create the premises for accepting conspiracy explanations. Predisposition to  reject information from experts has been found to influence this tendency (Uscinsky et al, 2020)."
"14" "A solid finding confirmed by several researchers is the fact that belief in one conspiracy narrative is consistent with belief in other conspiracies (Goertze l, 1994; Swami et al, 2011; Miller, 2020), even if sometimes these theories contain contradictory elements (Freeman et al, 2020)."
"15" "The fact that conspiracy beliefs have social implications, especially when it comes to health-related issues, is already stron gly documented (Jolley & Douglas, 2014; Imhoff & Lamberty, 2020). A series of studies attempting to assess whether belief in conspiracy narratives has a negative influence on compliance with official health recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic have  already  proven that this link exists (Freeman et al, 2020; Allington & Dhavan, 2020; Allington et al, 2020; Imhoff & Lamberty, 2020; Sultănescu, Achimescu & Sultănescu, in press)."
"16" "At the same time, the effect of conspiracy worldviews on people’s politica l attitudes, mainly trust and participation in democratic processes, has also been discussed (Sutton & Douglas, 2020). Belief in conspiracy theories might be connected with lower levels of institutional trust (Kramer, 1999; Freeman et al, 2020; Sutton & Do uglas, 2020) and is associated with more negative attitude towards authority (Swami et al, 2011) and with ideological polarization (Sutton & Douglas, 2020). Furthermore, exposure to conspiracy  narratives  was found to increase feelings of political powerles sness and decrease intention of political engagement (Jolley & Douglas, 2014) – at least  for  normative forms of political participation (Imhoff, Dieterle, & Lamberty, 2020) .    Believing conspiracy narratives can  influence attitude towards democracy, by lowe ring trust in institutions (Einstein & Glick, 2015) – thus they tend to act as “drivers of societal corrosion” (Freeman et al, 2020, p. 12)."
"17" "The spread of conspiracy beliefs is not always based on a natural contagion process depending on individual predispositions. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought forth two conditions that encourage or favor their dissemination: social media usage, found to ac t as a predictor of conspiracy belief (Allington et al, 2020), and intentional spread by interested parties (Bentzen, 2020; EEAS, 2020), acting as ” conspiracy entrepreneurs  who profit directly or indirectly from propagating” these ideas (Sunstein & Vermeul e, 2009, p. 212). There is a documented interest of certain geopolitical actors such as Russia to use turbulent periods and challenging events in order to increase confusion and undermine people’s trust in national authorities and institutions, with the pu rpose to weaken their faith in the Western model, “sowing disruption and discrediting the democratic model” (Nye, 2018, para. 6)."
"18" "In recent years,  Russia has been described to project and carry out “active measures” designed to destabilize societies (Galeo tti, 2017), to increase divisions within the European Un ion  (Sherr, 2013), or to undermine NATO (Lucas & Pomeranzev, 2016). These efforts have been designated through various terms – from disinformation to cyberwar; the latter term is used by Hall Jamieson  to describe a large array of actions that go well beyond the use of hackers, that the term itself initially evokes,  and include  subtle operations taking place in the cyber sphere, with the intention to influence decision-making processes, using tools as e lusive as “semantics and the choice of terms in public discourse” (Klimburg, quoted by Hall Jamieson, 2018, p. 8). Inducing confusion and cluttering the information space is sometimes an objective in itself (Galeotti, 2017), as this leads to destabilizatio n both at the decision-making and at the public opinion level. Information operations can often have no other purpose than creating chaos and increasing uncertainty by disseminating misinformation (Lin & Kerr, 2018). Influencing beliefs and behaviours, dis crediting institutions and decreasing trust in government are all tools used by cyber operations carried out on social media today (Prier, 2017) and their impact is amplified by current media consumption patterns (Lim, 2019)."
"19" "Throughout  history, due partly to its geographical placement, Romania often found itself in the position of a symbolic battlefield of the Eastern and Western spheres of influence; while its institutional allegiance to the Western model is firm, its population’s pro-E U and pro-NATO attitudes are still among the highest in the EU (European Commission, 2018), and Russia is viewed with suspicion by most, attracting only low trust percentages (Sultănescu, Achimescu, & Sultănescu, 2016; Sultănescu, Sultănescu, & Buti, 2019) , a minority are critical of certain aspects of the influence of the West on the day-to-day lives of Romanians (ranging from economic exploitation to cultural  colonization and national identity dilution), and they are the primary target for the conspiracy  narratives currently in circulation. Some (though not all) who reject Western values believe that Russia can offer an alternative, mainly based on the shared Orthodox religion. We thus distinguish two different types of trust patterns: toward the West (by  which we mainly refer to the USA, the European Union and NATO) and toward Russia, and we measure them independently in our surveys."
"20" "Building on a previous study (Sultănescu et al, in press), where we found that the Romanian public is vulnerable to COVID-19  conspiracy narratives and conspiracy beliefs are associated with a weaker predisposition to comply with official public health recommendations, we continue to analyse the consequences of conspiracy beliefs and attempt to further test whether these beliefs  are also associated with a stronger tendency to distrust institutions, which includes a tendency towards shifting geopolitical allegiances (less trust in Romania’s strategic partners, EU, NATO and the US, and more trust in Russia), seeing as, ever since t he pandemic started, Russian propaganda messages attempted to induce distrust in European authorities’ management of the pandemic (Bentzen, 2020), as well as promote various disinformation (US Department of State/GEC, 2020) and conspiracy narratives (EEAS,  2020). There have been various reports (either by institutional reports – Pantazi & Campean, 2020 or by media – Bobei, 2020; Dădăcuș, 2020; Gradinaru, 2020; Preoteasa & Mihai, 2020) of structural campaigns of attacking EU, NATO and Romanian institutions i n connection with the COVID-19 crisis, as well as aggressive promotion of conspiracy narratives."
"21" "HYPOTHESES"
"22" "Our main research question is whether there is an indirect relationship between distrust in Western actors and noncompliance with COVID-19 regulati ons, with conspiracy beliefs playing a crucial part in this relationship. We expect that those who do not trust the West and/or trust Russia are more likely to believe conspiracy narratives (H1). Believing conspiracy narratives makes them less likely to be  correctly informed about the transmission of the virus (H2) or concerned about the seriousness of the COVID-19 crisis (H3). Being misinformed and unconcerned will translate into a lower compliance with COVID-19 regulations (H4 and H5). We represent the mo del graphically in [FIGURE 1]:"
"23" "Figure 1. The theoretical model showing an indirect effect of trust in international entities on compliance with regulations around COVID-19"
"24" "Note . Full model in black lines (H1a+H1b+H2+H3+H4+H5), run on WEB survey (July 20 20) Reduced model in dashed green lines (H1a+H1b+H7), run on CATI survey (April 2020)"
"25" "Formally, we declare all hypotheses, as follows:"
"26" "H1a. People with higher degrees of trust in Russia tend to be more susceptible to believe conspiracy narratives."
"27" "H1b. Pe ople with higher degrees of trust in the West tend to be less susceptible to conspiracy narratives."
"28" "H2. A higher b elief in COVID-19-related conspiracy narratives is associated with a lower level of correct knowledge about the  transmission and treatment of  COVID-19"
"29" "H3. A higher belief in COVID-19-related conspiracy narratives is associated with a lower level of concern about the effects of the virus on a personal and societal level."
"30" "H4. A lower level of correct knowledge about the transmission and treatment  of COVID-19 is associated with  a lower predisposition to comply with official public health recommendations."
"31" "H5. A lower level of concern about the effects of the virus is associated with a lower predisposition to comply with official public health recomme ndations."
"32" "H6. The direct effect of trust in Russia on compliance with regulations is smaller than the indirect effect."
"33" "H7. A higher belief in COVID-19-related conspiracy narratives is associated with a lower predisposition to comply with official public health recommendations. We test this hypothesis on the  simplified model , that does not include Knowledge and Concern."
"34" "Th ese hypotheses will be tested on two datasets. We will test the complete model (H1 to H6) on our web survey, and the simplified model (H1a, H1b, and H7) on our CATI survey, due to data availability."
"35" "Data and methods"
"36" "In this paper, we use data from two su rveys : a probability based telephone survey using a minimal questionnaire, and a non-probability web survey with a larger questionnaire."
"37" "CATI survey on probability sample"
"38" "The first survey was carried out by phone (Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewin g, or CATI), on a probability sample (obtained using Random Digit Dialling) of 924 adults residing in Romania, in late April 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 crisis. Post-stratification weights were applied to adjust the distribution of sociodemographic  variables (age, gender, education, occupational status, region, urbanicity) to resemble marginal frequencies from the Romanian population register. This survey contains less than 100 variables, a number designed to avoid survey breakoffs and to keep the d ata collection costs at a reasonable value. The average completion time was 13 minutes. For the SEM analysis, we retained 789 respondents that did not exhibit item nonresponse on the key variables."
"39" "From this point, we refer to this survey as  the CATI surve y ."
"40" "Web survey using online panel"
"41" "The second survey was carried out online, on 914 adults residing in Romania, in July 2020, after the end of the emergency state in Romania. The web survey was not built on a probability sample, but on an opt-in online panel . The self-administered online questionnaire was designed using  SurveyGizmo . Quotas for age, gender and region were employed, but the sample is skewed toward more educated and urban dwellers compared to population values, and all respondents are internet u sers. This survey is more complex, with over 160 variables, and a longer completion time (an average of 15 minutes). We removed all responses with low data quality (response time below 5 minutes, did not pass attention test and item nonresponse). For the S tructural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis, we retained  545 respondents with high quality and complete responses."
"42" "From this point, we refer to this survey as  the Web survey ."
"43" "Methods"
"44" "All the key concepts that we refer to in this paper (conspiracy beliefs,  trust in international actors, correct knowledge about COVID-19, concern about COVID-19 and compliance to recommendations) are latent variables, meaning that they cannot be adequately captured using a single indicator. However, they can be measured by usin g multiple indicators, based on which latent variables (factors) can be constructed. There are many ways to do this, but we choose to run Confirmatory Factor Analyses for each of our six variables (represented with ellipses in [Figure 1])."
"45" "Hypotheses 1-6 represent a path model, run on the Web survey, where direct and indirect effects can be calculated. So do hypotheses H1a, H1b and H7, in the simplified version of the model, run on the CATI survey. A path model can be conceptualized as a ser ies of regressions, where a variable can be dependent in one regression, and independent in the next. Variables can be either manifest (directly measured) or latent (measured through multiple indicators). Effects can be either direct (A influences C) or in direct (A influences B, and B influences C, so B is a mediator between A and C)."
"46" "Both confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis can be modeled together under the framework of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Structural equation models are widely us ed in social sciences to construct latent variables and to test hypotheses about relationships between latent variables (Hoyle, 1995). They are particularly useful for running mediation analysis (Gunzler et al, 2013). In our case, we want to see whether co nspiracy beliefs can act as a mediator between trust in international entities and compliance with national COVID-19 regulations."
"47" "For data processing and analysis, we used R, version 3.6.1. We used the package  lavaan  (Rosseel 2012) ,  version  0.6-6  for runni ng the Structural Equation Models. The  maximum likelihood estimator  was used to fit the models."
"48" "Measurement in the Web survey"
"49" "All the key variables from the Web survey (represented by ellipses in [Figure 1]) are latent variables. They are constructed based on indicators with 5-point, 4-point scale answers (ordinal level of measurement) or yes/no answers. We extended the level of  measurement from nominal to ordinal compared to the CATI study where possible. Indicators are formulated in both directions (some  agreeing with the main concept and some disagreeing, or some true and some false), in order to reduce the effects of  acquiesce nce bias  on measurement. Acquiescence bias is the tendency of respondents to give positive answers (agree or yes) on all questions regardless of content (Krosnick 1999)."
"50" "Briefly, the main latent variables in the Web survey are described below. Because the  survey is not run on a probability sample, frequencies are not shown, although it should be noted that most of the common items have similar levels of agreement/disagreement as in the CATI survey. Descriptive statistics of all variables can be found in the  Appendix."
"51" "CONSPIRACY beliefs about COVID-19 is a construct measured with 14 variables, all on five point scales of agreement. Eight of them are formulated to suggest different conspiracy narratives, referring to the virus: being a hoax; a deliberate atte mpt to reduce the size of the population; a pretext for mass surveillance; created by a group of powerful people to make money; created  in a laboratory; caused by 5G radiation; vaccine will contain microchips to control the people; there is a global effor t to force vaccination. There are six statements that refute conspiracy narratives: the virus is real; there is no conspiracy around COVID-19; the virus is naturally occuring; the virus spread is accidental; information from experts and scientists should b e trusted; social distancing is necessary to reduce the spread. These statements are inspired by a previous study of conspiracy narratives in the United Kingdom (Allington & Dhavan, 2020)."
"52" "KNOWLEDGE about COVID-19 was initially measured with 10 variables,  but due to the low variation or low correlations they were reduced to six true/false statements. They asked whether COVID-19 can spread through air, touch, or from one person to another (considered all true by experts), whether vitamins or drinking liquids  are known cures (false) or if there is no official cure (true at the time of data collection). They were inspired by the statements found on the WHO website in the  mythbuster   section at the time the survey was designed."
"53" "CONCERN about COVID-19 is measure d with six variables, of which two are formulated neutrally (fear about the spread of the Covid-19 and the possibility of getting the virus), two measure agreement with statements expressing concern (biggest world crisis in the last 20 years; measures anti -COVID are necessary), and two - agreement with statements expressing lack of concern (authorities are exaggerating the danger; believing that the crisis is over)."
"54" "COMPLIANCE to COVID-19 guidelines is measured using 6 variables on a five point scale (from  completely true to completely false). Three statements refer to following the guidelines: washing hands often, staying two meters away from other people when outside, using masks in closed spaces. The other three refer to ignoring guidelines: meeting peopl e as often as before, leaving home even if exhibiting symptoms, and not changing anything about their own behavior due to the virus. These statements were also inspired by Allington & Dhavan (2020), and were adapted to the Romanian context."
"55" "TRUST in intern ational actors was measured using composite indicators. We modeled two latent variables: trust in Russia, and trust in the West. By “the West” we refer to the Euro-Atlantic group formed of the European Union, the United States and NATO. We grouped the thre e together because previous studies have shown them to be strongly correlated in terms of trust and attitudes  (Sultănescu, Achimescu, & Sultănescu, 2016). Trust in the West is measured by two items directly referring to trust (in EU and in NATO), three ite ms referring to pro-West perceptions (Romania benefits from EU membership, NATO can defend Romania, the US is a strong partner for Romania), and two items referring to anti-West perceptions (the US and EU are economically exploiting Romania; the EU will di sband in the next years). Trust in Russia is measured by two items directly referring to trust (in Russia and in Vladimir Putin), two items referring to pro-Russia perceptions (Russia defends traditional values, Romania should improve relationship with Rus sia), and three items referring to anti-West perceptions (Russia is not a model worth following, Russia promotes corruption and division in the area, Russia tries to destabilize EU and NATO)."
"56" "As control variables in the Web survey SEM model we used trust i n institutions, populist (anti-elite) beliefs, religious participation, media consumption and sociodemographics, because they were linked to our main variables in previous research. A very recent study (Freeman et al, 2020) found a link between conspiracy  beliefs and mistrust in institutions. We measure trust in Romanian institutions as a latent variable containing four items about trust: in the Government, in the army, in the newspapers and in NGOs. Research also shows strong connections between conspirato rial beliefs and populist attitudes (Castanho Silva, Vegetti, & Littvay, 2017). We measure populist attitudes as a latent variable with three items about agreement with anti-elite statements (politicians ignore the people, regular people would lead the cou ntry better than current leaders, most politicians should go to prison). Religious participation was included because it has a special significance in Romania, both as a link to Russia’s soft power ambitions via the Orthodox church (Van Herpen, 2016), and  due to the fact that early into the coronavirus crisis there were discussions within the official Orthodox church hierarchy with regard to endorsing the authorities’ measures or not. We measure religious participation by church attendance on a four point s cale (from never to weekly). Differential media consumption was shown to play a part as well: one COVID-19-related study (Allington et al, 2020) found a positive relation between the use of social media and holding conspiracy beliefs, and Mitchell et al. ( 2020) found that social media as a main news source is associated with a lower level of knowledgeability about the virus. We use multiple indicators for media consumption: having different sources of information (television, radio, news websites, social me dia) as binary variables, and overall media consumption frequency (an average of tv, radio and internet media consumption, all measured on five-point scales, from never to daily). We also included the variable “trust in Facebook”, to capture a separate asp ect of relationship to media."
"57" "As sociodemographic variables, we included education,  subjective  well-being,  gender and age.  Education is a strong predictor: both earlier and more recent research (Douglas, Sutton, Callan, Dawtry, & Harvey, 2016; Freeman &  Bentall, 2017) show direct or indirect links to conspiracy beliefs. Freeman et al (2020) and  Van Prooijen (2017) found clear associations between lower levels of education and a tendency to accept conspiracy-based explanations to major events. Lower incom e was also found to be associated with conspiracy endorsement (Freeman & Bentall, 2017). Regarding gender, at least one study found women less susceptible to support conspiracy theories compared to men in the case of COVID-19 (Cassese, Farhart, & Miller, 2 020). Descriptives for all control variables in the Web survey are presented in [Appendix 1]."
"58" "Measurement in the CATI survey"
"59" "In the CATI survey, a reduced set of variables was used due to time and financial constraints. Trust in Russia, USA and the Europea n Union were measured each through one variable on a four-point  scale. For the remaining variables of interest, we used indicators already tested in one UK study (Allington & Dhavan, 2020), in order to verify the results for Romania. They were translated i nto Romanian. Belief in conspiracy narratives was measured using four items, three pro-conspiracy (lab created virus, 5G link, virus created by strong corporations or states) and one anti-conspiracy (virus appeared naturally), all binary variables (agree,  disagree) with a nonresponse option. Adherence to COVID-19 guidelines was measured using three binary items, regarding hand washing, maintaining physical distance and staying indoors. All key variables from this survey can be inspected in [Table 1]. As con trols in the CATI survey, we used age, gender, education, and subjective well-being."
"60" "Results"
"61" "Descriptives and bivariate analyses"
"62" "Aggregated results from the CATI survey ([Table 1]) shows that in April 2020, 70% of respondents believed at least one of the  three conspiracy narratives, particularly that the virus was deliberately created in a laboratory (67% of respondents). Only one third of respondents appreciated that COVID-19 appeared naturally or accidentally. Compliance to official COVID-19 guidelines w ere observed by the vast majority of respondents: 82% for washing hands, 75% for staying indoors and 92% from keeping the required distance from other people. Regarding trust in international actors, it was highest among respondents for the European Union  (54% high+moderate trust), followed by the U.S. (42%), with trust in Russia at only 22%."
"63" "Table 1.  Results from the CATI survey (N=924 respondents)."
"64" "Note.  First, the list of conspiracy beliefs (in the Web survey, the list was much larger).  Second, the  list of health recommendations (during April, the topic of wearing masks was not relevant for discussion; it was included in the Web survey).  Third, the level of trust in the countries and institutions, in late April 2020 (enhanced in the Web survey with  statements about the perception of EU, US, NATO and Russia)"
"65" "Figure 2.  The relationship between trust in international actors and several conspiracy beliefs (CATI survey)."
"66" "Note.  Percent agreement with each statement, out of subsamples of respondents wh o declared they have trust in Russia, EU, USA, and the full sample. 95% confidence bands shown."
"67" "Bivariate analyses on the CATI survey show that the public that trusts Russia is more inclined to believe conspiracy narratives, and that the public that trust s the EU and the US is less inclined to believe conspiracy narratives  (see [Figure 2]). There is a negative correlation between the number of conspiracy narratives believed and level of trust in Russia (Spearman’s rho = 0.10, p<0.001). There are positive  correlations between the number of conspiracy narratives believed and level of trust in the US (rho = -0.11, p<0.001) and EU (rho = -0.21, p<0.001). The bivariate relationship between conspiracy belief and compliance with COVID-19 guidelines suggests inver se proportionality. There is a negative correlation (rho = -0.12, p<0.01) between the number of conspiracy narratives believed and the number of COVID-19 regulations that the respondents are following. To exemplify, almost 100% of those with minimal conspi racy beliefs declare they keep the physical distance from other people, compared to 85% of those with maximal conspiracy beliefs."
"68" "In order to further explore these results, we have created a more detailed model, using the Web survey (July 2020) - with more variables and an extended level of measurement (from nominal to ordinal). We do not show point estimates regarding our variables  based on data from the web survey, because it is not representative for the Romanian population (there is coverage error due to being an online panel, and the sampling frame is limited to members of the panels). We can however use the web survey to verify  the relations between the levels of trust in West/Russia, conspiracy beliefs and compliance with regulations using a much more elaborate set of measurements."
"69" "Measurement models (CFA)"
"70" "First, we look at the results from the Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)  performed to define our latent variables. The  conspiracy beliefs  latent variable contains the largest number of items, and they load on the factor with the expected sign: the pro-conspiracy statements with positive signs, and the anti-conspiracy statement s with negative signs. The highest loading is the  powerful interests  item (0.84) and the lowest is the  5G conspiracy  item (0.57); among the anti-conspiracy statements, the strongest is the  not conspiracy  item (-0.64) and the weakest the  social distancing w orks  item (-0.49).  Because we wanted to  focus on the common variance, we also modelled some covariances between error terms that made theoretical sense to correlate (for example, that between the  virus is hoax  item and the  virus is real  items), which show  extra covariation due to the similarity of the topic. Similar covariations were modeled for  vaccine-related  items,  deliberate infection conspiracies  (laboratory creation and population reduction conspiracies), the natural/human made dichotomy and the  soci al distance  and  listening to experts  anti-conspiracy items. See [Figure 3] and [Appendix 2] for factor structure and loadings."
"71" "Figure 3.  Measurement model for Conspiracy beliefs (CFA)"
"72" "Note.   Standardized factor loadings on the arrows. Modeled covariances  between error terms on the right side. Model fit is for the full measurement model (all latent variables). Fit indices:  CFI = 0.86; RMSEA = 0.052, p(RMSEA<0.05)=0.082; SRMR = 0.07; N = 553"
"73" "All the other CFA results can be inspected in [Appendix B]. In al l cases, the sign of each loading is in the right direction. The  Trust in Russia  factor separates from the  Trust in the West  factor, and they are negatively correlated (r=-0.19, p<0.001). The strongest standardized loading (-0.82) from the  Trust in Russia   factor is the statement that “Russia is trying to promote corruption in the region”. The strongest loading for the  Trust in the West  factor is the statement that “The EU is beneficial to Romania” (+0.94). The  Compliance  factor (6 items) has the highest loa dings (in modulo) for “no change in behavior” (-0.63) and “washing hands more often” (+0.56). For the  Concern  factor,  worrying about the situation in the country has the highest loading (+0.74), while the  Knowledge  factor has lower values for all loadings,  the highest being “transmission by touch” (0.418)."
"74" "The fit of the measurement model that includes all latent variables in the Web survey is adequate (CI for RMSEA between 0.050 and 0.054, CFI=0.86). It is possible that a solution with more latent variabl es would have offered a better fit, but we wanted to keep the latent variables to a minimum, in order to focus on the path relationships. In the CATI survey, the fit of the measurement model is somewhat similar (CI for RMSEA is between 0.059 and 0.076, CFI  = 0.93). Loadings from the CATI survey can be inspected in [Appendix C]."
"75" "Structural model (SEM)"
"76" "The structural model examines relationships between the latent variables. We ran a linear regression for each of our four main key variables (Compliance, Conc ern, Knowledge, Conspiracy) to test our hypotheses. The results for the Web survey are presented in [Appendix 1] and the main results are plotted in [Figure 4b]. We present the results in order of the hypotheses, in the form of standardized regression coef ficients."
"77" "Conspiracy beliefs  increase in strength if trust in Russia increases ( β =0.116, p=0.011), all other predictors held constant, confirming H1a. At the same time, conspiracy beliefs decrease in strength when trust in the West increases ( β =-0.595, p<0 .001), the strongest effect size out of all predictors. Trusting that Romania’s international allies are strong, stable  and well intentioned reduces one’s propensity to believe in conspiracy narratives. Some controls also show non-trivial associations. Co nspiracy beliefs also tend to increase with populist beliefs and trust in Facebook, and they tend to decrease with higher education, as past research has shown. The gender effect noted in previous studies is also hinted at ( β =0.06, p=0.078), with men having a higher appetite for conspiracy theories."
"78" "Knowledge  about the spread and (lack of) treatment for Coronavirus decreases when conspiracy beliefs increase ( β =-0.273, p=0.013), thus confirming hypothesis H2. It should be noted  that when controlling for conspiracy beliefs, the effect of trust in international actors is not significantly different from 0. Knowledge increases with increased overall media consumption  ( β =0.196, p=0.007), and no other variables in the model seem to  influence it."
"79" "Concern  about the spread and seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic decreases with increased level of conspiracy beliefs ( β =-0.506, p<0.001), confirming H3. At the same time, concern increases with knowledge about the pandemic ( β =0.431, p<0.001 ). Concern also increases with trust in national institutions, which have been sending messages of caution since the pandemic began. Concern also increases with age ( β =0.124, p=0.004), which can be explained by higher vulnerability in case of infection. An  older person who trusts national institutions, is well informed about how COVID-19 spreads and does not believe conspiracy narratives is most likely to have a high level of concern. Concern is not influenced by trust in international actors when controlli ng for conspiracy beliefs."
"80" "Finally,  compliance  with official COVID-19 guidelines is positively influenced by knowledge ( β =0.422, p=0.002), confirming H4, and by concern ( β =0.639, p<0.001), confirming H5. These two variables explain a large part of the vari ation in compliance, and no other factors of the ones measured seem to have a significant influence. Compliance is not influenced by trust in international actors when controlling for conspiracy beliefs, concern and knowledge."
"81" "The most important relationsh ips in the path model for the Web survey are presented in Figure 4b. They are in the same direction as in the theoretical model in Figure 1."
"82" "In our SEM model for the Web survey, the predictors explain a large part of the variation of the dependent variable s. The highest explained variance is for the noncompliance variable (R 2 =0.896), followed by concern about COVID-19 (R 2 =0.757), conspiracy beliefs variable (R 2 =0.573) and COVID-19 knowledge (R 2 =0.334)."

The regression table can be inspected in [APPENDIX 4] and a sim plified diagram is shown in Figure 4a.  Conspiracy beliefs  decrease with trust in the European Union ( β =-0.225, p<0.001) and increase with trust in Russia ( β =0.162, p<0.001). This confirms hypotheses H1a and H1b. They also decrease with education and subjec tive wellbeing. In turn,  compliance  with COVID-19 guidelines is negatively associated with conspiracy beliefs ( β =-0.157, p=0.022), confirming hypothesis H7. When controlling for conspiracy beliefs, trust in international actors does not have a noticeable   effect (p>0.150 for US, EU, Russia and China)."

"187" "Direct and indirect effects A simple inspection of the two empirical path mo dels (Figure 4) suggests that there is no direct effect between trust in the West or Russia and compliance or noncompliance with COVID-19 regulations when controlling for conspiracy beliefs, but several indirect paths between these two variables exist. We  can test whether these paths produce relevant effects if we construct regression coefficients for the direct and indirect effects."
"188" "We start with the simpler path model for the CATI survey. The direct path from trust to compliance shows a very weak effect, not likely to be different from 0 (b = 0.001, se = 0.009 for trust in Russia, and b=0.013, se=0.009 for trust in the EU). By contra st, the indirect path from trust to compliance, via conspiracy beliefs shows a stronger effect (b=-0.004, se=0.002 for trust in Russia, and b=0.005, se = 0.002 for trust in the EU). The indirect effect is computed by multiplying the effect of trust on cons piracy beliefs with the effect of conspiracy beliefs on compliance. As the indirect effect is more powerful than the direct effect, there is support for hypothesis H6 for the CATI survey."
"189" "In the Web survey, there are several paths from trust to compliance.  Just like in the CATI survey, the direct path shows a weak effect that is not statistically significant ( b=0.016, se =0.009 for trust in Russia, and b=-0.047, se = 0.041 for trust in the West). However, the indirect path from trust to conspiracy beliefs  to concern and finally to compliance shows a much stronger effect, especially in the case of trust in the West (b=0.106, se=0.028). The fact that the effect is positive means that the more respondents trust in the West, the more they are likely to comply w ith COVID-19 regulations, due to having weaker conspiracy beliefs and more concern about the spread of the virus. The alternative path through knowledge rather than concern also shows a weaker positive effect for trust in the West."

"269" "In summary, we find support for a ll our hypotheses in both models. H1b seems stronger than H1a, and H6 has more support for trust in the West than for trust in Russia. In other words, not trusting Western actors shows a stronger direct link to conspiracy belief and indirect link to noncom pliance (especially through decreased concern) compared to trusting non-Western actors such as Russia."
"270" "Discussion"
"271" "Our initial intention was to replicate a study from the UK (Allington & Dhavan, 2020) in order to see if there is a relationship between cons piracy beliefs and lack of compliance with public health recommendation in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic in Romania. We confirmed this connection, and furthermore built a new, more nuanced model, and successfully tested it at two  timepoints in diffe rent modes (telephone and web interviewing), showing strong links between our latent constructs. Our model explains not only the direct relationship between the conspiracy beliefs and conformity to rules, but also some indirect relationships, which can off er much more insight for the future."
"272" "The first indirect connection is related to the level of actual knowledge regarding the new coronavirus, the implication here being that stronger and better-tailored communication efforts, from official and credible vo ices, can increase people’s levels of understanding of the new threat, as well as their predisposition to comply to the safety recommendations. The usual paths of institutional communication (or even regular media and communication channels - via TV or Int ernet) used by the authorities could be insufficient to reach some categories of public that are less informed and thus more vulnerable to alternative explanations."
"273" "The second indirect connection we explored is also extremely relevant for the future - peo ple that believe conspiracy narratives are less inclined to be worried about the epidemic and, furthermore, less inclined to comply with official health guidance. This means that the power of alternative explanations is quite considerable, since it can inf luence pandemic-related behaviors and thus can potentially have a significant impact on public health. In reverse, it can be inferred that, if people’s levels of concern would increase, they would become more likely to comply with the official recommendati ons and, thus, be more protected."
"274" "Therefore, access to more and better information (made available for the majority of the population, not only for the groups that are used to search for news, data or facts) is crucial, as it can lead to a greater awarenes s of the situation and consequently increase personal concern regarding the epidemic, which in turn is conducive to compliance with norms. These instruments should be used, during this difficult period, to counter the effects of conspiracy beliefs, complem entary to the effort to debunk the actual conspiracy narratives."
"275" "The model appears to explain the relationship between the geopolitical orientation (trust in international actors), conspiracy beliefs and compliance with regulations. But while distrust make s it more likely to believe false information, exposure to disinformation can also affect trust in institutions. It is likely that the current COVID-19 crisis is generating a significant effect on the levels of trust in the West. Our previous work measured  the levels of trust in the Western countries and institutions and we have noticed that this year - in both surveys - those levels are lower compared to previous years. We did not explore, in this paper, if there is a direct connection between the increase d awareness of conspiracy beliefs and this crisis of trust (for Romania, or for other Eastern European countries)."
"276" "It is true that in this study we don’t measure actual exposure to deliberate conspiracy dissemination efforts, but only the level of belief  in certain conspiracy narratives. And while we cannot attribute these beliefs directly to foreign influence efforts, we do show that there are clear vulnerabilities in groups that feel that the West is failing Romania, that EU integration was not successfu l, and that NATO does not offer the country protection. An objective for a future study is to take into consideration official and non-official anti-Western narratives that come from Eastern institutional actors and the channels through which they are tran smitted."
"277" "The results seem to indicate that the current COVID-19 crisis can indeed be used as a perfect environment for geopolitical actors such as Russia to disseminate and promote disinformation and  conspiracy narratives, meant to provoke chaos and induce doubts i n national institutions and authorities and, furthermore, weaken trust in the Western model among the Romanian population. Worryingly, people with a pre-existing affinity for Russia are also more susceptible to conspiracy narratives and (possibly as a resu lt of exposure to these narratives) tend to disregard the official public health recommendations issued by the authorities. Although the percentage of trust in Russia is currently low in Romania, the corrosive effect that the current crisis seems to have o n trust in Western actors (the US, the EU and NATO), coupled with an increased Russian aggression on the disinformation front can lead to a dangerous situation – especially if the crisis-specific confusion is maintained for a longer period of time."
"278" "What i s more worrying though is that geopolitical actors such as Russia can use such periods and contexts to indirectly influence large categories of public whom they wouldn’t be able to reach in ordinary situations (people who don’t trust Russia, but easily acc ept conspiracy explanations related to the coronavirus crisis) – by employing disinformation tactics and promoting narratives which normally would not be plausible, and thus undermining the connection between the people and their institutions. The breach t hus created can be further widened through sustained efforts in the future."
"279" "There are several other limitations of the current study. From a methodological point of view, the CATI survey is representative for the Romanian population, but it is limited to a  small list of indicators measured. At the same time, the Web survey is much more complex, with a large number of indicators, but it does not use a probability sample. The surveys offer two snapshots in a fast changing environment, where information about  the virus and official guidelines can change from one time point to the other. Constant monitoring of conspiracy beliefs, concern and compliance to guidelines could be done not only in certain states, but across the European Union, in future research on pr obability samples, to capture the cross-continental effects of exposure to false information about the virus."
"280" "Moreover, the model can be improved by including some additional variables related to media use, or general sources of information. This is someth ing that can help with a better segmentation of the population - as part of an effort to identify categories of people that are excluded from the usual flows of public communication (and, in the end, become less predisposed to comply with new health regula tions)."
"281" "This is an unprecedented crisis and it calls for unprecedented efforts to contain the danger in all its forms - and in this case, misinformation can, unfortunately, actually kill. This study, along with others published during recent months on the  subject of COVID-19 and the (both obvious and subtle) dangers of disinformation created by this global phenomenon, can help reveal threats as well as solutions. Our research points out grave vulnerabilities, which can be exploited by malign actors, generat e public health risks and even endanger the stability of democratic values in certain social groups and societies. By revealing these vulnerabilities, such studies can also become a source of solutions and help guide the tremendous effort by the institutio ns involved in the fight to combat disinformation."
