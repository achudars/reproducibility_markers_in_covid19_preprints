Abstract :
As Covid-19 spreads across the world, governments turn a hopeful eye towards research and
development of a vaccine against this new disease. But it is one thing to make a vaccine available, and
it is quite another to convince the public to take the shot, as the precedent of the 2009 H1N1 flu
illustrated. In this paper, we present the results of four online surveys conducted in April 2020 in
representative samples of the French population 18 years of age and over (N=5,018). These surveys
were conducted during a period when the French population was on lockdown and the daily number of
deaths attributed to the virus reached its peak. We found that if a vaccine against the new coronavirus
became available, almost a quarter of respondents would not use it. We also found that attitudes to this
vaccine were correlated significantly with political partisanship and engagement with the political
system. Attitudes towards this future vaccine did not follow the traditional mapping of political attitudes
along a Left-Right axis but oppose people who feel close to governing parties (Centre, Left and Right)
on the one hand, and, on the other, people who feel close to Far-Left and Far-Right parties as well as
people who do not feel close to any party. We draw on the French sociological literature on ordinary

attitudes to politics to discuss our results as well as the cultural pathways via which political beliefs can
affect perceptions of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction
As Covid-19 spreads across the world, governments turn a hopeful eye towards research and
development of a vaccine against this new disease (Yamey et al., 2020). In the past century, vaccination
has progressively been seen not only as one of “medicine’s greatest life-savers” but also as the ideal
form of intervention against infectious diseases (Allen, 2008; Holmberg et al., 2017; Moulin, 1996). The
special status of vaccination is manifest in contemporary pandemic preparedness and management as it
has been institutionalized in the past 20 years. In most countries in the global North, pandemic
preparedness plans highlight the importance of devoting special resources to vaccine research and
development as well as fast-tracking market approval procedures (Torny, 2012). The definition of the
flu as the theoretical model for thinking about emerging infectious diseases has participated in this focus
on vaccination (Buton and Pierru, 2011; Torny, 2012). Indeed, a new flu vaccine is produced every year
in just a few months by integrating virus strains to pre-tested vaccines or vaccine-related technologies
(vaccine “mock-ups”, strain-growing techniques, adjuvants, preservatives…). The hopes put in
vaccination have not been dampened by the experience of the latest main pandemic in the global North:
the 2009 H1N1 flu scare. The virus was among the ones most expected to generate the next pandemic
(the H1N1-A strain of the flu, responsible for the most studied pandemic of all time: the Spanish flu of
1918-1919) and a vaccine was made available in vast quantities before the epidemic reached its peak.
But while governments succeeded in rolling out vaccines before the main wave of flu cases hit
the Northern hemisphere, they did not obtain high vaccination coverage in the public. In most countries,
this vaccination campaign was a resounding failure. Sweden, Canada, the USA, the Netherlands,
Hungary, and Norway were the only countries to achieve more than 20% coverage. In France, only 8%
of the population was vaccinated (Setbon and Raude, 2010). It is one thing to make a vaccine available,
and it is quite another to convince the public to take the shot. In the case of a putative future COVID-19
vaccine, it is crucial to take into consideration another development of the past ten to twenty years. For
more than a decade now, public doubt about vaccines has become an increasingly important global issue
(Dubé et al., 2013; Larson et al., 2016). This has recently led the World Health Organization to include
“Vaccine Hesitancy” – i.e. negative attitudes towards vaccines that do not amount to a radical refusal of
any form of vaccination – in its list of “ten threats to global health in 2019”. When a vaccine will be
available, will it be widely used? In countries where vaccine hesitancy was widespread before the
COVID-19 epidemic, will it affect the coronavirus vaccination campaign?
In this paper, we present the results of four online surveys conducted in April 2020 in
representative samples of the French population 18 years of age and over (N=5,018). These surveys

were conducted during a period when the French population was on lockdown and the daily number of
deaths attributed to the virus reached its peak. We found that if a vaccine against the new coronavirus
became available, almost a quarter of respondents would not use it. We also found that attitudes to this
vaccine were correlated significantly with political partisanship and engagement with the political
system.
These results are interesting not only because one would expect hesitancy toward this particular
vaccine to be weak given the strength of the international mobilization, the stringency of containment
measures, and the number of deaths rising rapidly. They are also striking because, at the time, no
prominent politician had questioned the safety or efficacy of the future COVID-19 vaccine. This is in
sharp contrast with previous studies of the relationship between politicization and vaccine hesitancy
which have focused on vaccines for which there have been much political investment in mainstream
news - such as the MMR and HPV vaccines in the United States of America (Baumgaertner et al., 2018;
Featherstone et al., 2019; Joslyn and Sylvester, 2017; Kahan, 2014). We draw on the French sociological
literature on ordinary attitudes to politics (Buton et al., 2016; Fillieule et al., 2017) to discuss our results
as well as the cultural pathways via which political beliefs can affect perceptions of vaccines during the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods.
Design and sample.
During each week of April 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional online survey among a sample
representative of the French population aged 18 and over (N=1,006 from 7th to 9th April, N=1,005 from
15th to 17th, N=1,004 from 24th to 26th, N=2,003 from 30th April to 4th May, global sample N=5,018). For
each survey, participants were randomly selected from an online research panel of more than 750,000
nationally representative households of the French general population developed and maintained by
IFOP (Paris, France), a survey research firm (https://www.ifop.com/). Random sampling was stratified
to match French official census statistics for gender, age, occupation, size of the population in the area
of residence and region. The study design was approved by the ethical committee of the University
Hospital Institute Méditerranée Infection (#2020-018).

Data collected.
In addition to background socio-economic variables (gender, age, educational level), we computed each
respondent’s equivalized household income per month, taking the size and composition of the household
into account, and was calculated using the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s
scale. Then we built a three-item indicator: ‘low income’ refers to the first quartile of the household
income per consumption unit (HICU), ‘intermediate income’ to the second and third quartile, ‘high
income’ to the last quartile. Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, participants were also asked whether
they have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and to what extent they worry about being infected with it.

They had to mark their worry from 0 (not worry at all) to 10 (very high worry) and we re-coded their
answer into a binary outcome: ‘high worry’ for marks 9 and 10, ‘less worry’ for lower marks. Regarding
partisanship, respondents were asked to which French political party they felt the closest (among a quite
comprehensive list of 17 parties), and responses were encoded into a four-item outcome: Far-Left, Green
party, Left/Center/Right governmental parties, Far-Right. For those who answered they felt close to no
party, we aimed to assess their degree of distance toward the political system. We therefore considered
their voting behavior at the first round of the 2017 presidential election, and we regrouped them into
three categories: no current preference but voted in 2017, no current preference and abstained in 2017,
no preference and other (for those who did not respond to the question related to the 2017 election or
were too young to vote). Regarding vaccination, respondents were asked whether they would agree to
get vaccinated if a vaccine against the COVID-19 was available: ‘certainly’, ‘probably’, ‘probably not’,
‘certainly not’. Responses were merged into a binary outcome: ‘COVID-19 vaccine refusal’ equaled 1
if participants answered probably or certainly not, otherwise the value was 0. Finally, in case they
answered probably or certainly not, they had to indicate why. Three non-exclusive reasons were
proposed: being against vaccination in general, thinking that a vaccine produced in a rush is too
dangerous, and finally considering the vaccine useless because of the harmless nature of the COVID19.
Respondents could also elaborate about other motives.

Statistical analysis.
We first used bivariate analyses and a logistic regression to investigate factors associated with COVID19 vaccine refusal, using respondents’ socio-economic background, COVID-19 diagnosis and worry,
and political preferences as covariates. We repeated these analyses for each of the three pre-coded
reasons for refusal. As the corresponding sample sizes were smaller, we used a forward stepwise
selection method (entry threshold p<0.05) to retain statistically significant covariates only.

Results

Almost a quarter of respondents would not take a vaccine against COVID-19
Among the 5,018 individuals surveyed, almost a quarter declared that they would refuse
“certainly” (7.9%) or “probably” (16.1%) the coronavirus vaccine if it were available. First, we
compared the two groups of people who would refuse the coronavirus vaccine. No difference was found
according to gender, age, and COVID-19-related worry. However, other differences were observed as
people with an educational level under the High School degree, those with a low or intermediate level
of household income per consumption unit (HICU), and those feeling close to a Far-Right party, were
more numerous to be certain they would refuse the vaccine. Table 1. displays the results of descriptive
and multivariate analyses highlighting factors associated with refusing the coronavirus vaccine

(“certainly” or “probably”). Therefore, refusing the vaccine was found to differ according to
sociodemographic characteristics such as gender, age, and level of HICU: women, young people (aged
under 35 years old), and those with a lower level of HICU were more likely to refuse the vaccine. By
contrast, no difference was observed across educational levels. Surprisingly, no difference was found
between people who were diagnosed with COVID-19 (2,5% of our sample) and those who were not.
However, COVID-19-related worry seemed to have a strong influence on intentions to vaccinate: those
who were highly worried about being infected with the disease were less likely to refuse the vaccine
compared to others (16.9% against 25.8%, p<0.0001).
After adjustment for gender, age, education level, HICU, and COVID19 diagnosis in a logistic model,
partisan preference remained significantly associated with refusing the coronavirus vaccine. Indeed,
respondents who felt close to extreme parties and those who did not feel close to any party and did not
vote at the last presidential campaign were significantly more likely to refuse the vaccine compared to
respondents with no partisan preference but who still voted in 2017 2017 (aOR[95% CI]: 1.36[1.06 ;
1.74] for Far-Left parties, 1.59 [1.19 ; 2.12] for those with no preference and who abstained, and
1.81[1.45 ; 2.27] for Far-Right parties), and even more compared to people who felt close to governing
parties (Right, Centre and Left) (aOR[95% CI]: 0.60 [0.48 ; 0.75]).

Reasons to refuse the coronavirus vaccine
Three main, but not exclusive reasons, were given to refuse the coronavirus vaccine: being
against vaccination in general (reason chosen by 27.6% of refusers), thinking that a vaccine produced
in a rush is too dangerous (64.4%), and finally considering the vaccine useless because of the harmless
nature of COVID-19 (9.6%). Moreover, around eight percent of refusers declared another reason to
reject this vaccine, including a general lack of trust (about politics, about medicine, about science, about
the pharmaceutical industry or unspecified), doubt about the efficiency of the vaccine (because of the
mutation process of the virus, comparisons with the flu vaccine), but also the belief that the respondent
was already immunized against the virus. But these responses were too diverse to be pooled into a new
category.

Analysis of these three main reasons highlighted the differentiated effects of the factors identified as
associated with refusing the coronavirus vaccine according to the reason exposed. Table 2 shows for
instance that men were more likely to refuse the vaccine because of the harmless nature of the disease
whereas women were conversely more likely to be against the vaccine (this one specifically or because
they are against vaccination in general).
These logistic models did not identify any strongly different effects of partisan proximity according to
the reason for refusing the vaccine. However, some of those effects seem stronger according to the
reason exposed. Far-Right parties related effect was higher when people refused the vaccine because
they were against vaccination in general (aOR = 2.14 versus 1.81 in the full model), while Far-Left
parties related effect was higher when people refused the vaccine because of the harmless nature of the
disease (aOR = 2.33 versus 1.36 in the full model). Also, people who did not feel close to any party and
did not vote at the last presidential campaign were more likely to refuse the coronavirus vaccine
following one main reason: they thought that a vaccine produced in a rush is too dangerous. Finally,
people feeling close to governing parties (Left-Center-Right), were much less prone to refuse the vaccine
for the first two reasons (being against vaccination in general: aOR = 0.52; thinking that this vaccine is
too dangerous: aOR = 0.59; all reasons confounded in the full model: aOR = 0.60).

Discussion and conclusion
We showed that almost a quarter of French adults would not get vaccinated against COVID-19
and that the main reason for this reticence was the idea that this vaccine would not be safe. This result
is coherent with previous studies showing that, in France, reticence towards vaccines tends to be
vaccine-specific rather than targeted at vaccination in general (Ward et al., 2019). This tendency is not
limited to the French public as the literature on vaccine hesitancy has shown in the past ten years
(Attwell, 2018; Dubé et al., 2013). But our main finding was that partisanship was an important
determinant of attitudes to this future vaccine.
To our knowledge, this is the first study of the effect of politicization on attitudes to vaccines in
France, one of the most vaccine-hesitant countries in the world (Gallup, 2019; Ward et al., 2019). The
role of politicization in vaccine hesitancy has mostly been studied in the United States of America where
political polarization has increasingly become an object of concern in the past 10 years. Several studies
found that conservative ideology or republican partisan identity is associated with various forms of
vaccine scepticism (Baumgaertner et al., 2018; Featherstone et al., 2019; Hornsey et al., 2020; Joslyn
and Sylvester, 2017; Rabinowitz et al., 2016). Other American studies have found no impact of
politicization (Kahan, 2014; Pew Research Center, 2020). In Australia, political ideology and the party
system seem to resemble more closely to the French one in that they cannot be reduced to an opposition
between two alternatives. There, one study found little effect of partisan identity on the propensity to
believe vaccines are unsafe (only people who would vote for the green party were slightly more likely
to believe that) (Smith et al., 2019) while another found that negative attitudes to vaccines were linked
to “minor political parties” (Rozbroj et al., 2019). In our study, we found that attitudes towards this
future vaccine do not follow the traditional mapping of political attitudes along a Left-Right axis. We
found an opposition between people who feel close to governing parties (Right, Centre and Left) on the

one hand, and, on the other, people who feel close to Far-Left and Far-Right parties as well as people
who do not feel close to any party (with the highest reticence for those among them who did not vote in
2017). These results underline the two main transformations of the French political system of the past
20 years: a rise in abstention and a possible current crisis of the Left-Right partisan dichotomy.
Let us start with non-partisanship and abstention. In France, the main explanation for abstention
is not that it reflects a conscious rejection of the political system in its present form (for reviews of the
literature, see (Braconnier, 2017; Buton et al., 2016). There is evidence to suggest that dissatisfaction
toward the political system is also very prevalent among those who do vote. Abstaining would rather
reflect an absence of political socialization: the development of a taste for political issues as well as the
presence in everyday life of the type of cultural practices (such as following the news) that lead people
to maintain this interest as well as prompt them to participate in political elections. The fact that nonpartisanship is associated with refusal of a future vaccine - especially when combined with abstention –
suggests that it reflects at least some dissatisfaction and distrust of institutions. This might be because
abstention is more prevalent among poor and marginalized, groups most at risk of having difficult
interactions with the various institutions of the French State or to feel abandoned by them. This
interpretation is supported in part by our finding that refusal increases as income decreases.
Nevertheless, this interpretation is weakened by the fact that non-partisanship was such a significant
factor even after controlling for income.
As for the rift in attitudes between people who feel close to governing parties and those who
feel close to Far-Right and Far-Left parties, this could reflect an on-going transformation of the French
political landscape. This transformation is partly due to the evolution of the main Far-Right party: the
Front National (FN), renamed “Rassemblement National” (RN) in 2018. Since 2011, it has been engaged
in a strategy of normalisation or “de-demonization”. Leaders of the party have attempted to polish their
discourse, excluded the activists found making overtly racist and anti-semitic comments, rebranded their
xenophobic nationalism as a defence of women’s freedom against the purported oppression of Islam and
presented themselves as defenders of the hard workers against the pro-European elites (Crépon and
Mayer, 2015; Dézé, 2017). This strategy has allowed the FN-RN to gain in popularity to the point that
it is considered the main opposition party since the 2017 presidential election. The emergence of
Emmanuel Macron’s centrist party La Republique en Marche (LaREM) is another important evolution
for the French political landscape. François Hollande’s presidency (2012-2017) disappointed many of
the Parti Socialiste (PS- Left-wing) voters as the policies put in place seemed to bring the party closer
to the Centre. This pushed many of these PS’s Left-leaning voters towards the Far-Left party France
Insoumise, while many Centre-leaning voters moved to LaREM. France Insoumise has, therefore,
become the main political force on the Left. The emergence of LaREM and the rise of the FN-RN have
also affected the main Right-wing party Les Républicains. The strengthening of competition on both
sides exacerbated internal tensions and the party has struggled to find its voice and mobilize its activists
since 2017. These phenomena combined with the emergence of new radical political media, and with

the development of social media has led many to believe that we are witnessing a process of polarization
“à la française”: a “vertical” polarization where the opposition is not so much between the Left and the
Right but between institutionalist actors (governing parties, mainstream media…) and anti-elite actors
(extreme parties, radical social movements, radical media…) (Institut Montaigne, 2019).
But how can these political opinions affect representations of a putative future vaccine against
COVID-19? Indeed, most issues related to health are not commonly perceived as politicized. How do
individuals come to include a vaccine in the list of objects and decisions upon which they apply their
political understanding of the world? In his work on motivated reasoning, Dan Kahan suggests two
pathways via which worldviews and ideology come to play in people’s perceptions: a) the person
spontaneously perceives the issue as warranting a political-cultural interpretation, and b) the sources of
information provide cues signalling the political-cultural nature of the issue at hand (Kahan, 2012;
Kahan et al., 2017). Activists and politicians have a crucial role in foregrounding politics in people’s
perception of issues. In the case of the putative future vaccine against COVID-19, it is important to note
that, to our knowledge, at the time of writing this paper, no major political figure has voiced concern
over these future vaccines. This constitutes a sharp difference with other studies of the effect of
politicization on vaccine hesitancy which have tended to focus either on attitudes to vaccination in
general or on attitudes to intensely debated and politicized vaccines such as MMR and HPV. This
particularity suggests that the reticence we recorded is at least in part due to the spontaneous
understanding of this issue using a political lens. But the question remains of what, in this idea of a
future COVID-19 vaccine, constitutes a partisan cue for our respondents. We suggest two non-exclusive
interpretations.
Firstly, this politicized reticence could reflect the mobilizations in the past years of Far-Right
and Far-Left activists against certain vaccines or vaccination in general. These mobilisations could have
sensitized Far-Right and Far-Left leaning people to vaccine-related issues in general. But if we follow
this interpretation, we should find the strongest reticence among people feeling close to the Green party
since environmental activists have been among the most visible figures of vaccine criticism in the past
ten years (Ward, 2016). The fact that we only found a relatively small over-representation of reticence
among them could reflect the diverse activist base and electorate. The party attracts both moderate
reformers who advocate for more sustainable development and alliances with governing parties and
radical activists who advocate for a more significant overhaul of institutions (Boy, 2012; Ollitrault,
2008). The issue of vaccination seems to have fallen spot on these lines and has been the object of much
internal and public debate in the past years. Those who pushed forward the issue of vaccination could
only represent a dissenting minority within this movement.
Secondly, this reticence could reflect the increasing politicization of debates surrounding the
pandemic. During the period covered by our surveys, members of the Far-Right and the Far-Left have
severely criticised the government on many issues. This was particularly the case of the Rassemblement
National which seems to have adopted a strategy of systematic criticism, while France Insoumise has

opted for more targeted attacks1. Both have presented the various difficulties faced during this pandemic
and the errors made by public authorities as reflecting the ideology of “Macronism”. In doing so, they
may have fostered a general distrust of public health authorities and decisions regarding anything related
to COVID-19 – including future vaccines.
This brings us to our final point. The evolution of this hesitancy in the future will depend on the
evolution of knowledge on the virus and its spread in France. But it will also depend on how
governments will anticipate possible reticence in the future and whether they manage to avoid vaccines
becoming part of political debates. The choice to make the future vaccine mandatory or not is also likely
to bear on the public’s perception, as studies suggest that political polarization is stronger on the issue
of legal mandates than it is on the issue of vaccine safety (Blank and Shaw, 2015; Kahan, 2014). It is
crucial to guarantee that all the necessary precautions are taken before marketing the vaccine and to
communicate transparently on the process as we have argued elsewhere (COCONEL, 2020). In this
regard, the current emphasis of the US government on the speed at which the vaccine must be produced,
its choice of experts to coordinate vaccine research efforts2 as well as its apparent policy of lifting many
constraints on the marketing of various medical technologies in relation to COVID-19, is concerning.
Given the international nature of vaccine research, this may have repercussions in many other countries,
including France.
