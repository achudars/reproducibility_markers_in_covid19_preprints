Abstract
We conduct a large-scale survey experiment in nine European countries to
study how priming a major crisis (COVID-19), common economic interests,
and a shared identity influences altruism, reciprocity and trust of EU citizens. We find that priming the COVID-19 pandemic increases altruism and
reciprocity towards compatriots, citizens of other EU countries, and nonEU citizens. Priming common European values also boosts altruism and
reciprocity but only towards compatriots and fellow Europeans. Priming
common economic interests has no tangible impact on behaviour. Trust in
others is not aﬀected by any treatment. Our results are consistent with the
parochial altruism hypothesis, which asserts that because altruism arises out
of inter-group conflict, humans show a tendency to favor members of their own
groups.

Introduction

The evolution of altruism is one of the most studied phenomena in both natural
(Nowak et al.

2010) and social sciences (Kurzban et al.

2015).

One of the

key theories to explain altruism in humans involves group competition (Bowles
2006). Importantly, the theory predicts that this competition-driven altruism will
be intensified in critical events, such as wars, and that it is not directed universally
towards all members of the species but that it is “parochial” in nature (Choi and
Bowles 2007).1 This means that altruism is more likely to be triggered if those
aﬀected by a catastrophe share elements of the potential donor’s identity.2

In

this work we causally identify factors that enhance trust, reciprocity and altruism
towards other individuals in society. In particular, we are interested in whether
critical periods and a sense of “group belonging” induce people to display otherregarding preferences.
Previous evidence on this topic is rather mixed. Fisman et al. (2015), for
example, compare Dictator game donations before and after the Great Recession
and find that donations went down. Meer et al. (2017) also find that charitable
donations decreased in the Great Recession in ways that are not explained by changes
in income and health. And yet, Kalogeraki (2018) finds that in Greece “Since 2008
there has been a great proliferation of civil society initiatives traced in the plethora
of social solidarity networks that aim to help vulnerable social groups to cope with
the detrimental eﬀects of the crisis.” Also, Hartman and Morse (2020) show that
exposure to violence in the Liberian civil war makes individuals more likely to “host
a higher proportion of non-coethnic, non-coreligious and distressed refugees” in the
Ivorian refugee crisis. In terms of identity, Bernhard et al. (2006) show that thirdparty altruistic punishment is more common for own group members, Yamagishi
and Mifune (2008) show that dictators need to know the recipients share group
membership to enhance their generosity, and Vázquez et al. (2017) show that sharing
a sense of identity fosters altruism in twins.3
1

The robustness of this conclusion is debated in Dyble (2021).
This can sometimes lead to paradoxical results. Bernhard et al. (2006) show that because ingroup
members are punished less often for norm violations by the ingroup, the group suﬀers from more
norm violations.
3
Other studies have documented how historical experiences of cooperation (or conflict) in the face
of adversities or external threats can have a persistent impact on social preferences and social
capital (Nunn and Wantchekon 2011; Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales 2016; Buggle and Durante
2021).

Our paper contributes to this literature by exploring several factors aﬀecting
generosity simultaneously in a context where causality can be more properly attributed, and working with a representative sample of individuals from very diverse
countries in Europe.
Specifically, we present novel evidence from a large incentivized survey experiment on how trust, reciprocity, and altruism are aﬀected by a major health
crisis (COVID-19), common economic interests (EU trade), and shared values (EU
ideals). We also study how the eﬀect varies depending on whether these attitudes are
directed at individuals from the same country, citizens of other European countries,
and non-EU citizens. We conducted the survey in August 2020 in nine European
countries where the impact of the pandemic was considerably diﬀerent: France,
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and Sweden.4
The survey was organized as follows. Participants were randomly assigned into
one of three treatments or a control group. All groups were first asked a question
about a social or economic phenomenon, and were then given information about
it. In Treatment 1 (COVID-19) subjects were asked and told about the impact
of the pandemic, in terms of total deaths per million people, in their own country
relative to the EU as a whole. In Treatment 2 (EU Trade) participants were asked
and informed about their country’s share of exports going to other EU countries.
Treatment 3 (EU Values) discussed what share of respondents in the Eurobarometer
survey across all EU countries mentioned peace, democracy, protection of human
rights or equality as fundamental and highly representative of the European project.
Finally, participants in the control group were asked and informed about a neutral
fact, in this case, the population density of their country.
After the treatment phase, subjects participated in two standard incentivized
games: the Dictator game and the Trust game.5 The goal is to assess how the
decisions of individuals exposed to the diﬀerent treatments (COVID-19, EU trade,
EU values) - which are still present in their mind - diﬀer from those in the control
group.
The Dictator game aims to measure generosity towards others. Each player is
4

The survey was also fielded in two non-EU countries (Turkey and Serbia). However, this paper
solely focuses on the survey experiments conducted in the EU countries.

These games are incentivized since subjects know that their remuneration - beyond the fee they
receive for completing the survey - depends on their own decisions and those of the players they
are matched with.

given 200 points and is asked to choose how much to transfer to another randomly
matched participant. In our experiment the sender is asked to choose the size of
the transfer for three diﬀerent cases: if the recipient is from the same country,
from another EU country, or from a non-EU country. Crucially, since the receiver
makes no decision, the sender’s choice reflects unconditional altruism rather than
reciprocity.
The Trust game also involves a sender and a receiver. The sender is assigned
100 points and decides between: i) sending 50 points to the receiver and keeping 50
points for themselves, ii) sending 200 points to the receiver who then chooses how
many points (between 0 and 150) to return to the sender. From the perspective of the
sender, the second option is riskier, since they only receive a payment if the receiver
sends back points. However, it is potentially more profitable since the total points
to be split between the two players are twice as large. The decision of the sender
measures their level of trust that the other player will not behave opportunistically.
The decision of the receiver reflects, instead, their level of reciprocity towards
someone who has behaved nicely towards them. As in the dictator game, participants
are allowed to make diﬀerent choices depending on the country of origin of the other
player (same, other EU, non-EU).
After the games, participants were asked various questions about their political
orientation, the strength of their European identity, their level of income, and the
evolution of the latter during the pandemic.
It is important to note that the treatments we propose are rather mild, and
simply prime certain information which is likely already present in the respondent’s
mind.6 Hence, in the absence of other ethical ways to induce a major crisis or an
identity shock, our experiment provides a clean way to estimate the causal eﬀect
of these aspects on trust, reciprocity and altruism, which arguably represents the
lower bound of the true eﬀect.
Our results can be summarized as follows. We find that priming the COVID-19
crisis (T1) has a positive eﬀect on both altruism (that is, the sender’s choice in the
Dictator game) and reciprocity (that is, the receiver’s choice in the Trust game). The
eﬀect is sizeable (between 2% and 3%) and statistically significant regardless of the
country of the other party, though generally larger for compatriots (for reciprocity
6

Other papers use similar priming techniques to investigate various aspects of the COVID-19
pandemic. See for instance Daniele et al. (2020) and Bartos et al. (2020). Alesina et al. (2018)
use priming to investigate the eﬀect of immigration on demand for redistribution.

and altruism) and fellow EU citizens (for altruism), than for non-EU citizens.
Priming European common values (T3) also has a significant impact on both
reciprocity and altruism, but only towards respondents of the same country and
of other EU countries.

Interestingly, the eﬀect on altruism is very similar for

compatriots and other EU citizens. This patterns confirms that, indeed, the values
primed in this treatment are perceived as common to EU citizens rather than
universal.
Priming EU trade relations (T2) has a limited impact on all three outcomes,
and only displays marginally significant eﬀects on reciprocity towards compatriots
(positive) and altruism towards non-EU citizens (negative). Finally, we find respondents’ trust in others (that is, the sender’s choice in the Trust game) to be unaﬀected
by any of the treatments, with all coeﬃcients being precisely estimated zeros.
These results are consistent with the parochial altruism hypothesis: a major
crisis and a shared identity boost altruism and reciprocity in general but more
intensely for closer groups. The lack of eﬀect on trust suggests the eﬀect comes from
enhanced empathy towards others, and not by the expectation that they will behave
better.
Finally, we examine how our treatment eﬀects vary depending on the characteristics of the respondents and of their place of residence. To refine our search,
we use a causal forest methodology (Wager and Athey 2018). Six variables emerge
as most relevant from this approach: i) the strength of European identity, ii) the
incidence of COVID-19 cases in the region, iii) the economic eﬀect of COVID-19
on the household, iv) household income in February 2020 (pre-pandemic), v) age,
and vi) political orientation. We then replicate our baseline econometric analysis
including interaction terms between our treatments and each of the above-mentioned
variables. Three of them appear to be important in mediating the eﬀect of our
treatments: regional incidence of COVID-19, economic impact of COVID-19 on the
household, and political orientation.
In particular, the heterogeneity of results for the priming of COVID-19 (T1)
indicate that the positive eﬀect of the treatment on altruism is stronger for individuals that were economically hit by the pandemic, who are more generous towards
people both within and outside the EU. At the same time, when COVID-19 is
primed, these same individuals display less trust in fellow citizens. This could be
a reaction to perceived lack of support by the community. Along the same lines,

5

we find that, for individuals from regions heavily aﬀected by the pandemic, T1 has
a significant negative eﬀect on trust, this time directed towards non-EU citizens.
Finally, regarding the mediating role of political orientation, we find that the priming
of COVID-19 has a stronger positive eﬀect on trust, reciprocity, and altruism for
right-leaning respondents. However, these eﬀects are only (marginally) significant
for attitudes towards citizens of the same country, consistent with these individuals
identifying strongly with their national community. We find similar heterogeneity
in results for T2 and T3. Overall, given the large number of potential dimensions of
heterogeneity, it is reasonable to conclude that our treatment eﬀects are, to a large
extent, homogeneous.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the
survey, the experimental design, including the Trust and the Dictator game, and the
descriptive statistics. In section 3 we discuss the empirical strategy, and in section
4 we present the results. Section 5 concludes.

2.1

Survey Design and Descriptive Statistics
Data collection and the survey structure

We conducted large-scale surveys in nine EU member countries (France, Germany,
Greece, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden) and in two nonEU countries (Serbia, Turkey) in early August 2020. The surveys were designed
using an online platform and the survey participation links were distributed by the
professional survey company Respondi.7 The samples were aimed to be broadly
representative with respect to age, gender and sub-national region and with a good
spread across income classes. We designed the original questionnaire in English,
which was then translated into the major conversational languages of each country
by professional translators. To ensure the quality of translations, an independent
third party with knowledge of the survey also reviewed and revised the translation
as necessary.
In terms of recruitment of respondents, the professional survey company sent
out survey links via email to its pool of respondents. Emails informed potential
participants about the length and non-commercial nature of the survey, but they
7

6

were not told about the topic. Participation was voluntary and once respondents
agreed to take part in the survey they were directed to the consent page and asked
some initial screening questions that ensured that the quotas for age, gender and subnational region were met. All respondents in our sample fully completed the survey
and received a baseline remuneration of about 2 Euros and an extra payment, which
was based on their decisions made in the Trust and Dictator games. The average
time for completion of the survey was about 20 minutes.
Our survey consisted of four blocks: (i) initial screening questions on sociodemographic characteristics; (ii) random split of respondents into four groups (three
treatment groups and one control group); (iii) Trust and Dictator games; and (iv)
other questions used for the heterogeneity analysis (such as strength of European
identity, political preferences, economic impact of COVID-19 on the respondent’s
household).8
We adopted common practices to enhance data quality: (i) Following other
papers relying on online surveys (Prescott et al. 2016; Barrero et al. 2021), we clean
our data by dropping respondents in the bottom 10% of the survey time distribution.
These respondents completed the survey in half of the expected time which makes
it unlikely that questions were considered carefully.9 (ii) Throughout the survey, we
randomized the answer options to prevent order bias, which might arise when all
respondents view the answer options in the same order. Our final sample includes
25,720 respondents (about 2,800-3,100 participants per EU country) between 18 and
70 years of age.10

2.2

Experimental design and the information treatments

After the first set of screening questions on socio-demographic characteristics, respondents were randomly assigned into four diﬀerent groups in each of the nine
8

The main questionnaire can be found here.
We implemented an attention check at the end of the survey where respondents were asked whether
they could recall the information presented in our treatments. We find that respondents in the
bottom 10% of the survey time distribution are much less likely to recall the presented information.
The correlation between the time spent on the survey and the result of the attention check (1 if
respondents answered correctly, 0 otherwise) is positive and significant for the full sample, but
becomes insignificant once those who completed the survey speedily are dropped. It is reassuring,
however, that our results are mostly unaﬀected by the sample selection.

As explained below, respondents in the two non-EU countries participated in the Trust and
Dictator games but received diﬀerent information treatments and outcome questions whose analysis

EU member country samples. We refer to the first sub-sample as the COVID-19
treatment group (T1), to the second as the EU Trade treatment group (T2) and to
the third as the EU Common Values treatment group (T3). The fourth sub-sample
is the control group. All sub-samples contain about 700-750 survey respondents per
country.
We designed our experiments to study how various information treatments
aﬀect behavior in the Trust and Dictator games. The respondents received the
following information treatments:
1. COVID-19 treatment group (T1): Respondents were told that the COVID-19
pandemic is causing large-scale loss of life and severe human suﬀering. Next,
they were asked whether they think that the number of confirmed COVID-19
deaths per million people in their country by July 1, 2020, was higher, lower
or around the same as in the EU as a whole.
2. EU Trade treatment group (T2): Respondents were informed that exports of
goods within the EU have substantially increased in recent decades as economic
integration within the EU’s internal market has intensified. Next, they were
asked what share of exports from their country they thought went to other
EU countries in 2019.
3. EU Common Values treatment group (T3): Respondents were told that according to a recent Eurobarometer survey, European citizens consider the
following values as fundamental and highly representative of the European
project: peace, democracy, protection of human rights and equality. They
were then asked about what share of respondents across all EU countries they
believed had mentioned at least one of these values as fundamental and highly
representative of the European project.
After answering the respective question, respondents in all three treatment
groups were told the correct answer. In particular, they were provided with information on the COVID-19 death toll per capita in their country and in the EU (T1),
the export share in EU trade in their country (T2), and the share of Eurobarometer
respondents across all EU countries agreeing on the most frequently mentioned
common values in the EU (T3).
Respondents in the control group were informed about a neutral fact that
would not be expected to influence any of their later answers in the survey: we
8

asked them to guess their country’s population density in 2019 and then informed
them of the correct number.

2.3

Our outcome measures for trust, reciprocity, and altruism

After providing respondents with the respective information treatments described
above, the survey continued with the Trust game and the Dictator game which were
played in a random order.
Each game was played between two players (Player A and Player B), and
participants were informed that they were randomly matched with another survey
respondent who could either be from their own country, from another EU country
or from a non-EU country. They had to take decisions both as Player A and Player
B in the Trust game and as Player A in the Dictator game, and for each of the three
possible matches (fellow player from own country / another EU country / non-EU
country), respectively. Respondents were not informed if they were actually matched
with a person from their own country, from another EU country or from a non-EU
country.11
The order of the three decision situations was randomized. Respondents were
also told that - depending on their own decisions and those of their counterpart in
the game - they could earn points (that is, remuneration) determined by the points
they earned in the selected game. After the survey was completed in all countries,
we randomly matched participants in pairs12 and randomly decided which one is
Player A and which one is Player B. This process determined the pay-out from the
relevant game for each respondent.13
In both games, players took decisions, which determined the allocation of
points between themselves and their counterpart. In the Trust game, Player A had
to decide between two options:
11

To avoid stereotypes aﬀecting respondents’ selections in the two games, we also did not inform
them which EU or non-EU countries their fellow player could potentially come from.
12
Matched pairs are either “respondent’s country - respondent’s country”, “respondent’s country another EU country”, or “respondent’s country - non-EU country”.
13
Respondents were paid in their local currency. 100 points earned in the selected game correspond
to 1 EUR. The average pay-out in our sample amounts to 0.85 EUR. This is not a large amount,
but Camerer and Hogarth (1999) show for games as ours that behavior is not sensitive to the size
of experimental incentives.

9

1. Option A1: By choosing this option, Player A allocated 50 points to themselves
and 50 points to Player B.
2. Option A2: This option handed over the decision to Player B, who received
200 points and could decide how many points to keep for themselves, and how
many points to allocate to Player A. Player B had to keep a minimum of 50
points for themselves so that any number between 0 and 150 points could be
allocated to Player A. By choosing this option, Player A could potentially
increase their own payoﬀ, but only if they trusted in Player B to return more
than 50 points to them.
All respondents were also asked to make selections as Player B in the Trust
game for the case that Player A would choose option A2. In the Dictator game,
Player A got 200 points and decided how much to keep for themselves and how much
to allocate to Player B. Player B did not make any active decisions in this game.
Player A could theoretically keep all the points for themselves.
After getting the full schedule of allocations, we construct our main outcome
variables based on the following definitions:
Trust: We consider the choice of option A2 by Player A as a sign of trust
towards their counterpart. Our outcome variable for trust takes a value of 1 if the
Player A chose option A2 and zero otherwise.
Reciprocity : We consider Player B’s decision as reciprocal if they returned
more than 50 points to Player A. Our outcome variable for reciprocity ranges
between 0 to 150 points.
Altruism: Any positive amount of points that Player A allocated to Player B
in the Dictator game is interpreted as a sign of altruism, with the degree of altruism
increasing with the number of points. Our outcome variable for altruism ranges
between 0 to 200.

2.4

Additional data

We employ data from the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission on
the cumulative regional COVID-19 case incidence at the NUTS-2 level by 31 July
2020. As we elicited the NUTS-2 region respondents are living in, we are able to
merge the regional COVID-19 incidence to our survey data. These data are used in
the heterogeneity analysis (Section 4.2).

Descriptive statistics

Balance
Appendix Table A1 shows socio-demographic characteristics of the survey respondents in the three treatment groups and the control group. A formal balancing test
revealing that each sub-sample is balanced along observable respondent characteristics is presented in Section 4.3.
Initial beliefs
As mentioned above, before informing respondents about the COVID-19 death toll
(T1), their country’s export share in EU trade (T2) and the agreement among
European citizens on shared values in the EU (T3), we elicited their prior beliefs
about these numbers. On one hand, this was done to increase the treatment eﬀect
(if people are asked about an issue first and have to guess a number, it can generally
be expected that they think more about said issue than if they are simply presented
with information) but on the other hand it also helps us pinpoint whether our
treatments were (predominantly) “positive” or “negative” (depending on how beliefs
were corrected on average).
Appendix Table A2 reports the share of respondents in the three treatment
groups whose beliefs elicited prior to the information treatment were correct as well
as the share of respondents underestimating or overestimating the numbers.14 In
the COVID-19 treatment group, 13% (31%) of respondents wrongly believe that
the per capita COVID-19 death toll in their country by July 1, 2020, was higher
(lower) than in the EU. The information treatment therefore moves their beliefs
downwards (upwards). 47% of respondents answer the question on the incidence of
confirmed COVID-19 deaths in their country relative to the EU average correctly.
Both in the EU trade (66%) and the EU common values treatment group (52%), the
majority of respondents underestimate the correct values, that is, their beliefs about
the importance of the EU internal market for their country’s exports and about the
share of European citizens who agree on the most important common values in the
EU are moved upwards. A fifth (T2) and roughly a quarter (T3) of respondents
14

For respondents in the EU Trade (T2) and the EU Common Values (T3) treatment groups who
were asked to provide a percentage, we define a correct answer as not deviating more than +/5 percentage points from the correct value. Note that the “Don’t know” answer option was only
available for respondents in the COVID-19 treatment group.

11

overestimate the correct values and only relatively few respondents provide correct
answers.
As initial beliefs for EU trade integration and common values were below the
truth for the majority of respondents, the average treatment eﬀects can be regarded
as displaying the results of (on average) an upwards correction concerning these
beliefs. It can thus be argued that treatments T2 and T3 were on average “positive”
(pro EU) treatments.15 On the other hand, T1 was certainly not a generally positive
or optimistic treatment - in fact it was probably rather pessimistic on average,
irrespective of where countries stood in terms of COVID-19 aﬀectedness compared
to the rest of the EU, because it put the COVID-19 pandemic with all its ensuing
problems front and centre in respondents’ minds.
Appendix Tables A3–A5 report country-specific statistics on the beliefs elicited
prior to the information treatments. As shown in Table A3, Germany, Greece,
Hungary, and Poland are the four EU countries in our sample which had a COVID19 death toll below the EU average by July 1, 2020, while the number of COVID-19
deaths was above the EU average in France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and
Sweden. In the former group of countries, most respondents estimated correctly
that their countries’ death toll per capita was below EU average (except for Poland,
where people were split roughly half and half in their prior beliefs). On the other
hand, respondents in the latter group mostly underestimated their countries’ death
toll compared to EU average in all countries except Spain. Table A4 reveals that in
respondents’ beliefs about the importance of EU trade for their country varies a lot
across diﬀerent countries. While in Germany and Sweden, for example, the share of
respondents who over- and underestimate the export share in EU trade is relatively
similar, respectively, the majority of respondents underestimate the true value in
the other EU countries in our sample. In contrast, the agreement on common values
in the EU (Table A5) is underestimated by the majority of respondents in all nine
EU countries in our sample.
Outcome variables
Appendix Tables A6–A8 provide summary statistics for the selections made in the
Trust game and the Dictator game. Appendix Table A6 presents the share of respon15

At least concerning T3 this is a relatively uncontroversial claim. Concerning T2, it could be argued
that for those respondents who do not regard EU trade integration as beneficial, the treatment is
not necessarily positive.

dents in the three treatment groups (T1-T3) and the control group choosing option
A1 and A2 as Player A in the Trust game if the fellow player is from respondent’s
country, from another EU country and from a non-EU country, respectively. In the
full sample, option A1 (A2) is chosen by 59-60% (40-41%) of the respondents (see
column “Total”). There are relatively small diﬀerences in the shares across the four
sub-groups (T1-T3 and control group) and depending on whether the fellow player is
from the respondent’s own country, another EU country or from a non-EU country.
As Player B in the Trust game, the average number of points returned to
Player A amounts to 84-87 as shown in column 5 of Table A7. Diﬀerences across
sub-groups are somewhat more pronounced than for Player A in the Trust game
and, as one might expect, the degree of reciprocity is highest (lowest) if the fellow
player is from the respondent’s own country (a non-EU country).
In the Dictator game (Table A8), the average number of points Player A sends
to Player B ranges from 98-105 points (column 5). It is higher in T1 and T3 as
compared to T2. As for Player B in the Trust game, mean values are highest (lowest)
if the fellow player is from the respondent’s own country (a non-EU country).
Appendix Tables A9-A11 show descriptive statistics for our outcome variables
trust, reciprocity and altruism by country.16 There are some notable diﬀerences
across countries. The share of respondents who show trust towards their fellow
players by choosing option A2 as Player A in the Trust game is highest in Hungary,
the Netherlands and Sweden. France, Hungary, and Spain are the countries where
respondents on average reveal the highest level of reciprocity, while the level of
altruism is on average highest in Italy and Hungary.

Empirical Strategy

We use OLS models to estimate the average treatment eﬀects for ease of interpretation, though logit regression models returned similar patterns. Our models take
the following form:

information treatments presented above. Given that the information treatments are
randomized and therefore independent of all other relevant variables, their eﬀects
can be interpreted in a causal manner.

time-invariant variation in the outcome variables caused by factors that vary across
countries) and date fixed eﬀects, &t , (to capture the impact of country-level shocks

Results
Average treatment eﬀects

This section presents average treatment eﬀects of the COVID-19 treatment (T1),
the EU trade treatment (T2), and the EU common values treatment (T3) on
interpersonal trust, reciprocity and altruism while heterogeneous treatment eﬀects
are presented in Section 4.2. As described in Section 2, after the randomized
information treatments, all respondents continued the survey by playing the Trust
and Dictator game in random order, both as Player A and B in the Trust game and
as Player A in the Dictator game. We interpret the selection of option A2 as Player
A in the Trust game as trusting behavior. Reciprocity (altruism) is measured by
the number of points Player B in the Trust game (Player A in the Dictator game)
allocated to their fellow player.
We present average treatment eﬀects on our main outcomes (trust, reciprocity
and altruism) in Table 1 separately for whether the fellow player was from the
respondents’ own country, another EU country or a non-EU country. When it
comes to trust, we find that none of our treatments has a significant eﬀect on the
selections made by respondents as Player A in the Trust game on average.18 Looking
17

All our results hold when excluding these covariates (regression tables available upon request).
Table A12 in the Appendix reveals that logit regressions yield the same result. As shown in Section
4.2, there are heterogeneous treatment eﬀects on trust though which cancel out on average.

18

14

at reciprocity, we find that both the COVID-19 treatment (T1) and the EU common
values treatment (T3) lead to more reciprocal behavior if respondents assume the
fellow player to be from their own country. In this case, respondents in T1 and T3
send on average 2 points more to Player A compared to respondents in the control
group. The treatment eﬀect corresponds to roughly 2% of the average number of
points respondents in the control group send back to Player A. Moreover, we find
positive albeit somewhat smaller treatment eﬀects for T3 if the fellow player is from
another EU country and for T1 if the fellow player is from a non-EU country. The
average treatment eﬀect is weakly significant for T1 if the fellow player is assumed
to be from another EU country and for T2 if the fellow player is assumed to be from
the respondent’s own country. Apart from the latter, the EU trade treatment (T2)
does not lead to significant diﬀerences in behavior compared to the control group.
Finally, we find that both the COVID-19 treatment (T1) and the EU common
values treatment (T3) significantly increase respondents’ altruism if they make their
selection under the assumption that their fellow player is a citizen of their own
country or a citizen of another EU member state. Moreover, T1 also leads to a
higher level of altruism if the fellow player is assumed to be from a non-EU country.
On average, these treatment eﬀects amount to 2-3 points which corresponds to 2-3%
of the average number of points respondents in the control group send to their fellow
players. Again, only one of the average treatment eﬀects of the EU trade treatment
(T2) is weakly significant. Respondents in T2 allocate fewer points to Player B if
the selection is made under the assumption that the fellow player is from a non-EU
country.

Figures A1-A3 in the Appendix present average treatment eﬀects at the country level. As shown in Figure A1, the null finding for the eﬀect on trust holds across
all nine EU countries in our sample. If anything, the EU common values treatment
reduces trust towards fellow players from non-EU countries in Italy and Sweden.
For the eﬀect on reciprocity (Figure A2), we find particularly strong eﬀects from
the COVID-19 treatment (T1) in Spain, where reciprocity is positively aﬀected,
irrespective of the fellow player being from the respondent’s country, another EU
country or from a non-EU country. In a similar vein, the EU common values
treatment (T3) leads to higher reciprocity in particular in France, Poland, and
Spain if the fellow player is from the respondent’s own country or from another EU
country. For the eﬀect on altruism (Figure A3), T1 and T3 lead to strongest upward
shifts in France and Spain.19
19

After the games we also collected information about the respondent’s evaluation of how their
national government managed the pandemic, and trust in their government. In this regard, we find
that priming the pandemic (T1) led to a significant decline in respondents’ trust in the government,
though only in countries where the death toll due to COVID-19 was higher (that is, above EU
average). These additional results, available upon request, support the view that, due to poor
management of the pandemic, citizens’ perception of the competence of policy makers worsened,
fueling disenchantment and distrust in institutions.

4.2.1

Heterogeneity analysis
Selection of variables

We also look beyond the average treatment eﬀects to understand how the causal
eﬀects vary with observable characteristics. To select the variables along which to
explore treatment heterogeneity, and later on also to identify (potentially non-linear)
heterogeneous treatment eﬀects (that is, variation in the direction and magnitude
of treatment eﬀects for individuals within a population), we use Causal Forests
methodology, which provides a data-driven, less selective framework for heterogeneous treatment estimation (Athey and Imbens 2016; Athey et al. 2019).
In particular, we build regression trees that systematically split the control
variable space into increasingly smaller subsets and aim to predict an outcome variable by building on the observations with similar characteristics. When a variable
has very little predictive power, it is assigned a negative importance score, which is
essentially equivalent to low importance for treatment heterogeneity. Overall, Causal
Forest estimation combines a magnitude of regression trees to identify treatment
eﬀects, where each tree is defined by diﬀerent orders and subsets of covariates.
We consider our three information treatments for heterogeneity, namely T1:
COVID-19, T2: Trade and T3: EU Common Values and feed the Causal Forest
algorithm the full set of control variables defined in Section 3 as well as attitudinal
variables (EU identity, political orientation), indicators for economic and health
vulnerability in the COVID-19 pandemic (economic eﬀect of COVID-19 on the
respondent’s household, per capita number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the
respondent’s sub-region, whether respondent has a suspected COVID-19 infection)
and additional socio-demographic characteristics (religion, urban residency).20 Our
model takes the following form:

20

0
0
Yf
ict = ↵i (Xit ) + ⌧i (Xit )Ti + uict

(2)

As we elicit respondents’ political orientation and EU identity only after our treatments, these
variables could theoretically be aﬀected by them. Using them as controls or for heterogeneity
analysis could thus pose endogeneity problems. However, as Table A14 shows, both variables do
not seem to be significantly aﬀected by any of our treatments. We thus consider their inclusion in
our analyses as valid.

17

21
where Yf
ict is a summary index, which is constructed based on points allocated
0

in Trust and Dictator games, of respondent i in county c and survey date t, and Xit
includes the list of variables described above.22

Appendix Figures A4, A5, and A6 present the variable importance results
for the fellow player being from (a) the respondent’s own country, (b) another
EU country, and (c) a non-EU country.23 We consistently find that the following
six dimensions have the highest predictive power for our outcome variables: (i)
respondent’s age; (ii) household equivalized income quintile in February, 2020 ; (iii)
per capita number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the respondent’s sub-region; (iv)
political orientation (in terms of left–right spectrum); (v) economic eﬀect of the
COVID-19 pandemic on the respondent’s household (not at all, just a little, a fair
amount, and a great deal), and (vi) EU identity (ranging from not feeling a citizen
of EU to feeling a citizen of EU only). Therefore, we only focus on these dimensions
in the following analyses.
4.2.2

Heterogeneous treatment eﬀects: interpersonal trust, reciprocity,
altruism

We present the results from standard OLS regressions including interactions of the
above variables (which have been identified as important for treatment heterogeneity
via Causal Forest). Tables 2 to 4 show these results for regional COVID-19 case
incidence, economic eﬀect of COVID-19 on the respondent’s household and political
orientation. The regressions include the same set of control variables as before in
the analysis of average treatment eﬀects and, additionally, the interacted variables
as well as interaction terms between the treatment dummies and country dummies,
education, and gender, respectively. The latter interaction terms are included to
21

For each individual, we calculate the index score as follows: points allocated in the Dictator game
+ points allocated in the Trust game as Player B + 100 points if the choice in the Trust game as
Player A was A2 (and zero points otherwise).
22
For the sake of clarity and space, we don’t show the variable importance graphs for each outcome
separately. The variable importance results considering outcomes separately return similar patterns
and are available upon request.
23
Appendix Figures A4–A6 simplify the visualization of the control variables by reporting aggregates.
For example, the indicator “education level” includes the respective education dummies (primary,
secondary, tertiary) and describes how often one of the education dummies is used to split the
estimation sample in Causal Forests. Note also that we do not report the country fixed eﬀects and
date fixed eﬀects (although they are included in our Causal Forest models) in variable importance
graphs since our main purpose is to understand which individual observable characteristics are
important for treatment heterogeneity.

18

make sure that the interaction terms of interest included in Tables 2–4 are not
driven by single countries or the educational level or gender of respondents. We
performed the same analysis also for age, income and EU identity, but as we did not
find any significant interaction eﬀects we report these regression tables only in the
Appendix (see Tables A15 to A17).
One key result that emerges from Tables 2 to 4 is that respondents who were
economically aﬀected by the COVID-19 crisis are less trusting. The estimated
coeﬃcient terms are negative for T1 and T3, but only significantly diﬀerent from
zero concerning trust towards fellow natives in T1, and towards non-EU citizens in
T3. On the other hand, these people are more altruistic in T1 and T2. The eﬀects
are significant at conventional levels and rather high for altruism towards other EU
citizens and towards non-EU citizens. There is no corresponding eﬀect concerning
altruism in T3, the estimated interaction eﬀects are even negative (though not significant). Reciprocity doesn’t seem to vary with respondents’ economic aﬀectedness
in any treatment group.
Respondents living in a region with higher COVID-19 case incidence seem to
be less trusting, in particular towards EU and non-EU citizens, in every treatment
group. However, the eﬀects are only significant for trust towards non-EU citizens
in T1 and towards other EU citizens in T2. They seem to be more reciprocal in
all treatments, though the eﬀects are small and only statistically significant for
reciprocity towards fellow natives and non-EU citizens in T2 and towards EU and
non-EU citizens in T3. Altruism doesn’t seem to be aﬀected by regional incidence
in any of our treatments.
Respondents who describe themselves as politically right-wing seem to be
more trusting, reciprocal and altruistic towards fellow nationals in all our treatment
groups, with significant interaction eﬀects for all three outcomes if primed with
COVID-19, and also if primed with EU Common values in the case of trust and
with EU Trade in the case of reciprocity.
We also checked the existence of non-linear treatment eﬀects, for example by
looking at diﬀerent age or income groups, or by diﬀerentiating between respondents
who live in regions with high vs. low COVID-19 incidence, who have low vs. high
EU identity or who are at the left vs. right end of the political spectrum. By and
large, results do not change much when we account for the possibility of non-linear

Robustness checks

Balancing tests
The main identifying assumption of our analysis is that the randomization of our
information treatments worked properly.

Therefore, we compute diﬀerences in

mean values of key socio-demographic characteristics as well as the mean time to
complete the survey between the three treatment groups and the control group,
respectively, and test for their statistical significance. As can be seen in Table A13

22

in the Appendix, most of the diﬀerences are insignificant or only weakly significant
suggesting that the randomization worked well.

Respondents in the EU trade

treatment group (T2) completed the survey somewhat faster than respondents in
the control group. However, time diﬀerences are small which suggests that our
information treatments do not diﬀer in their complexity.
Excluding one country at a time
In Figures A7–A9 in the Appendix, we estimate average treatment eﬀects of T1-T3
on trust, reciprocity and altruism, but exclude one country at a time in order to
examine to what extent our results are driven by specific countries. The first estimate
in each panel (dark blue line) is based on the full sample and refers to the baseline
result (cf. Table 1), while the following estimates show how the baseline result
changes when one country at a time is excluded. Our baseline result for trust holds
for all sample variations. The average treatment eﬀect of the COVID-19 treatment
(T1) (the EU common values treatment (T3)) on reciprocity lose some significance
for fellow players from other EU countries when Spain, France or Germany (T1)
(Spain or Poland (T3)) are excluded from the sample. The significant eﬀect of T1
and T3 on altruism remains significant when single countries are excluded.

Concluding Remarks

Altruism, reciprocity and social trust are important determinants for prosperity
and a well-functioning society. Our paper provides causal evidence on how common
crises (in particular the COVID-19 crisis), common economic interests and common
values aﬀect these qualities among European citizens. We ran an incentivized survey
experiment in nine EU (eleven European) countries in early August 2020. Our
treatment groups were primed with their country’s COVID-19 death toll relative
to the EU average, with their country’s degree of EU trade integration and with
commonly held European values, respectively, while the control group received
neutral information unlikely to aﬀect their actions and responses later in the survey.
Afterwards, survey respondents played the Trust and Dictator games, where they
could earn an extra payment depending on their decisions and the decisions of their
matched player, who could be either a fellow citizen, a respondent from another
EU country or a citizen from a non-EU country. Subsequently, they answered a set

23

of attitudinal questions also related to their personal experience of the COVID-19
pandemic.
We show that the common crisis and the common values treatment have the
strongest eﬀects, in particular on altruism and reciprocity towards fellow natives
and other EU citizens. Interpersonal trust is not aﬀected on average. Priming
respondents with a common economic interest, on the other hand, doesn’t have
much eﬀect on any of our three main outcome variables.
Our results are consistent with the parochial altruism hypothesis that a crisis
or shared identity can enhance altruism, in particular for closer groups. In addition,
we show that reciprocity tends to work in a similar way. Interpersonal trust, on
the other hand, seems to be a more stable quality, less easily aﬀected by our
priming treatments. A shared economic interest doesn’t have a significant impact
on altruism or reciprocity, neither towards fellow natives nor towards other EU or
non-EU citizens. This result suggests that economic interests alone do not suﬃce
to build social cohesion and unity.
