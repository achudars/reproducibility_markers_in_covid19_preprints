Summary
Background: Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) combine the impact of morbidity and
mortality and can enable comprehensive, and comparable, assessments of direct and indirect
health harms due to COVID-19. Our aim was to estimate DALYs directly due to COVID-19 in
Scotland, during 2020; and contextualise its population impact relative to other causes of
disease and injury.
Methods: National deaths and daily case data were used. Deaths were based on underlying
and contributory causes recorded on death certificates. We calculated DALYs based on the
COVID-19 consensus model and methods outlined by the European Burden of Disease
Network. DALYs were presented as a range, using a sensitivity based on Years of Life Lost
estimates using: cause-specific; and COVID-19 related deaths. All estimates were for 2020.
Findings: In 2020, estimates of COVID-19 DALYs in Scotland ranged from 96,500 to
108,200. Direct COVID-19 DALYs were substantial enough to be framed as the second
leading cause of disease and injury, with only ischaemic heart disease having a larger impact
on population health. Mortality contributed 98% of total DALYs.
Interpretation: The direct population health impact of COVID-19 has been very substantial.
Despite unprecedented mitigation efforts, COVID-19 developed from a single identified case
in early 2020 to a condition with an impact in Scotland second only to ischaemic heart
disease. Periodic estimation of DALYs during 2021, and beyond, will provide indications of
the impact of DALYs averted due to the national rollout of the vaccination programme and
other continued mitigation efforts, although new variants may pose significant challenges.

Funding: This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public,
commercial or not-for-profit sectors.

Introduction
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 30th January
2020.1 It was subsequently designated as a global pandemic on 11th March 2020 by the
WHO Director General.2 Early in the pandemic the largest share of worldwide deaths
emerged in Europe, with recorded estimates of over half-a-million COVID-19 deaths in
Europe during 2020.3 In Scotland, the first confirmed case was detected in Tayside on 1st
March 2020, in a person who had recently returned from travel in Northern Italy.4 Since then
COVID-19 has had a devastating impact in Scotland in 2020 – around 127,000 positive cases
were identified, and over 6,800 COVID-19 related deaths were recorded, with deaths
occurring most frequently in the elderly, vulnerable and frail.5,6
Many efforts are being made to assess the direct impact of COVID-19, including publication of
daily numbers of suspected and confirmed positive cases, hospitalisations and
hospitalisations requiring intensive care. In Scotland, both the Scottish Government and
National Records of Scotland (NRS) have reported on the extent of COVID-19 mortality using
different definitions.5,6 All of this information contributes to building an understanding of the
direct population impact of COVID-19. Scottish and UK-wide studies have quantified the
comparative fatal population health impact through the loss of life expectancy at birth, years
of life lost to premature mortality (YLL) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).7-9 Studies in
other countries have combined the impact of morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in a
consistent and comparable way using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), to allow framing
in the wider context of other causes of disease and injury.10,11 To date, COVID-19 DALY
studies have not yet been carried out in the United Kingdom, or any of its constituent nations.
Burden of disease approaches allow estimates of the occurrence of morbidity and mortality to
be translated into a single measure facilitating comparisons with other causes of disease,
injury and mortality.12 This is achieved by standardising the effects of morbidity and mortality
as population health loss as a function of time, using the composite measure of DALYs.13 The
occurrence of morbidity is translated to estimates of years lived with disability (YLD) by
adjusting for severity and relative disability suffered due to each cause of disease or injury.
Death counts are translated into estimates of YLL, using age-conditional life tables,
recognising that deaths at younger ages have a greater impact on population health. DALYs
are estimated by summing YLD and YLL. As causes of disease or injury are measured in a
consistent way using DALYs, disease burden studies have become an increasingly popular
way to assess population health impact as a means to support and influence national, and
local, decision-making. The Scottish Burden of Disease study (SBOD) was set up to
comprehensively estimate the population health impact of causes of disease and injury
through estimating DALYs using routine data sources.14 Integration of estimates of COVID-19
DALYs is, therefore, essential to ensure that this assessment remains comprehensive across
all causes of disease and injury.
The aim of this study was to estimate the direct impact of COVID-19 on the population health
of Scotland during 2020; the first full calendar year in which COVID-19 was a globally
recognised disease entity, and contextualise its population impact relative to other causes of
disease and injury.

Method
Data
Data on death registrations was sourced from NRS.6 These data were provisional, as final
mortality statistics are updated based on results of legal enquiries into some deaths. This
mainly affects deaths from external causes, including suicide and drug-related deaths.
COVID-19 deaths were identified as those where the underlying, or any contributory, cause of
death was coded using the emergency ICD-10 codes U07.1 or U07.2, based on guidance
from the WHO.15 Deaths were included in this study if the date of death was during 2020, with
the first death occurring in mid-March 2020. The dataset was generated on 25th February

3

2021, to allow additional time to capture the later registrations of some deaths occurring
towards the end of 2020.
Case estimates were sourced from the Public Health Scotland (PHS) SEIR (Susceptible →
Exposed → Infected → Recovered) transmission model.16 The model assumptions and
approach have been described elsewhere, and the model builds upon work used in response
to the 2009-2010 influenza epidemic in Malta.17,18 Estimates from this model were used to
calculate person-years of disability for community-based (moderate) cases, and to identify the
total number of people that were infected. Person-years takes into account the number of
people that were infected and the duration of time that each person suffered health loss, and
therefore avoids the need for any assumption about assigning average durations to the
number of infections. Symptomatic infections were characterised in three ways: (i)
community-based, not requiring hospitalisation; (ii) requiring hospitalisation but not intensive
care unit admission; and, (iii) requiring intensive care. Daily data from PHS were used to
calculate the person-years due to hospitalised and intensive care unit cases.5 Estimates from
earlier in the pandemic were based on both suspected and confirmed cases. However from
22nd July 2020, data are based on confirmed cases only as suspected cases were no longer
published.
The most recent estimates of the number of DALYs due to other causes of disease and injury
in 2018 were estimated from the SBOD study, to allow the number of DALYs due to COVID19 to be framed within a ranking of causes of health loss prior to the pandemic (Table S1).14.
Additionally, estimates of health loss in Scotland derived by the GBD 2019 study were
extracted from the GBD Results Tool for 2019 by individual cause.19
Analyses
The modelling approach to calculating DALYs was based on the COVID-19 consensus model
and methods outlined by the European Burden of Disease Network and the European Centre
for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).20
Death counts were aggregated by five-year age-group and sex to calculate YLL. For the
purposes of YLL calculations, the under-5 years age-group was split into under 1 year and 1
to 4 years, and the upper open-ended age-group was set at 95 years and above. YLL
estimates were derived by multiplying the number of deaths in each age-group by the ageconditional life expectancy defined by the GBD 2019 reference life table, which assigns the
same values to both males and females.21
Daily data, on the number of COVID-19 cases, were used to compute the number of personyears for each COVID-19 health state. Person-years were calculated as the sum of the
1
number of cases reported each day, scaled by a factor of
(to reflect the contribution of
365.25
individual days to a complete year, since DALYs use year as the unit of time). To estimate
YLD due to post-acute consequences for “long-COVID” patients, we assumed that
approximately 1-in-7 patients (13.3%) that were infected would suffer post-acute
consequences for four weeks (28 days), reflecting early available transition probabilities.22
Health states were defined using descriptions and disability weights from the GBD 2019 and
European Disability Weight Study (EDWS) and are shown in Table 1.23,24 Person-years were
multiplied by disability weights for each health state to estimate YLD, and summed with YLL
to estimate DALYs.
Estimates were framed in terms of ranking of causes of DALYs using a pre-COVID-19
pandemic counterfactual ranking of the leading causes of disease or injury. All COVID-19
estimates presented are for calendar year 2020 in Scotland.

Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses
The greatest sources of uncertainty in our estimates relate to biases in the measurement of
the number of cases – particularly community infections – and the proportion of cases that
suffer from post-acute consequences of COVID-19, rather than random variation in our data
systems. Thus, we used sensitivity analyses to quantify the impact around these uncertainties
(Table S2). Sensitivity analyses related to uncertainty around the number of community cases
were based on increasing the number of moderate cases by a fixed percentage, similar to the
method adopted in another study of COVID-19 DALYs.10 Our sensitivity analyses based on
the transition from acute to post-acute consequences from infection, were based on applying
different transition probabilities in two ways, for: (i) all cases; and, (ii) symptomatic cases only.
We also varied our assumptions by providing scenarios with half or double the duration of
post-acute consequences.
For mortality, we outlined two scenarios and have presented our main estimate of DALYs as
a range based on this sensitivity. This range is based on YLL calculated using cause-specific
deaths (i.e. where the underlying cause of death was COVID-19) and YLL calculated using
deaths involving COVID-19 (i.e. where either the underlying, or any of up to 10 contributing
causes mentioned on the death certificate was COVID-19).
When framing our main estimated range of DALYs, we performed an additional sensitivity
analysis using data extracted from GBD 2019 (Table S3). This was to illustrate whether the
framing of COVID-19 differed based on whether SBOD or GBD estimates were used.

Results
Direct population health impact of COVID-19
It was estimated that 641,789 people were infected by COVID-19 in Scotland in 2020. Taking
into account the duration of infection, we estimated this reflected 7,363 person-years infected
with symptomatic COVID-19 (90.8% moderate; 8.7% severe; and, 0.6% ICU) which
generated 453 YLD from acute infection (Table 2). It was estimated that approximately 85,400
patients suffered from post-acute consequences, such as fatigue and emotional lability, which
generated a further 1,433 YLD, giving 1,886 YLD directly due to acute and post-acute
consequences of COVID-19. Around three-quarters of YLD (76.0% of total YLD) was
generated from post-acute consequences of COVID-19. Although ICU cases were the most
debilitating to individuals, their short-term population impact on total YLD was the smallest
(1.5% of total YLD) because of the relatively small number of patients who required ICU
treatment.
In 2020, there were 6,845 COVID-19 related deaths, of which 6,167 were cause-specific
deaths, with respective YLL estimates of 106,357 and 94,633. YLL per COVID-19 death
ranged from 15.3 to 15.5. Overall it was estimated that in 2020, DALYs directly due to
COVID-19 were between 96,519 and 108,243. The majority of DALYs were generated
through the impact of mortality, with YLL representing 98% of DALYs.

estimates representative for calendar year 2020.

When comparing the number of direct COVID-19 DALYs with the pre-COVID-19 leading
causes of disease and injury in Scotland, COVID-19 generated enough DALYs in 2020 to
represent the second leading cause of death and disability in Scotland (Figure 1). The
estimated lower limit of DALYs was higher than Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias,
whereas the estimated upper limit of DALYs was considerably less than the DALYs due to
ischaemic heart disease.
Sensitivity analyses
Through combinations of assumptions designed to minimise, or maximise, the impact on YLD
estimates, our estimates of YLD ranged from 632 to 6,356 YLD (Table S2). These were
largely driven by assumptions over the incidence and duration of post-acute consequences,
as undercounts of milder cases did not have a large impact on overall YLD estimates. None
of our defined scenarios changed our finding that COVID-19 DALYs likely represented the
second leading cause of death and disability in Scotland in 2020. This is because YLD only
contributes around 2% of total COVID-19 DALYs.
Ranking our range of direct COVID-19 DALYs (including incorporating results from our
sensitivity analyses) using the alternative GBD 2019 Scottish results indicated that COVID-19
would have represented the second leading cause of disease in Scotland (Table S3). This is
6

consistent with the framing in our main analyses using SBOD estimates, with DALYs falling
short of those due to ischaemic heart disease, but higher than all other individual causes of
disease and injury.

Discussion
Summary
We estimated that there were between 96,500 to 108,200 DALYs directly due to COVID-19 in
Scotland during 2020. DALYs due to COVID-19 were likely to have had the second largest
population health impact, relative to all other individual causes of disease and injury. The
combined impact of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality was lower than ischaemic heart
disease, but higher than all other leading causes of DALYs, such as: Alzheimer's and other
dementias, lung cancer, and drug use disorders. The majority of population health loss was
due to mortality, representing 98% of DALYs, and 15 YLL were estimated per COVID-19
death.
These conclusions remain consistent across our full range of sensitivity analyses, which were
designed to accommodate a range of scenarios regarding: potential under-ascertainment of
community (non-hospitalised) infections; and the transition to, and duration of, post-acute
consequences from acute COVID-19 infection. The framing of COVID-19 as the second
leading cause was also consistent in our sensitivity analysis using findings for Scotland from
the GBD 2019 study.
Although individual COVID-19 cases requiring hospital, or intensive care support, have
considerable consequences for the ill-health of individuals, post-acute consequences
7

following infection (such as fatigue or emotional lability) pose the largest cumulative impact on
population health when measured by YLD for survivors. Although evidence on the risk and
duration of post-acute consequences is highly uncertain, this conclusion remains consistent
throughout our wide range of sensitivity analyses.
Strengths and weaknesses
Although our estimates of COVID-19 mortality are based on provisional death registrations,
they are unlikely to significantly differ from final mortality estimates. The largest differences
between provisional and final cause of death estimates are in external and ill-defined causes.
During the early emergence of COVID-19 there was potential for deaths not to be certified as
COVID-19, particularly in the absence of a positive test, but it is difficult to quantify any bias
related to under- or over-recording of COVID-19 deaths.25 We believe that by presenting our
estimates as a range, we have incorporated the main factors which are likely to have the
largest impact on our estimates.
When framing the number of DALYs within a pre-pandemic cause list, there are some
potential pitfalls to consider, related to competing risk of death. It is unlikely that all COVID-19
deaths are additional, and it is likely that at least some of them replace deaths that would
have occurred due to other causes, though the extent to which this is true should not be
overstated.8 There is evidence that during the first wave of the pandemic in spring/summer
2020 there was a slight excess of deaths due to Alzheimer’s and dementia, and circulatory
causes, with much larger decreases in respiratory deaths.6 However, there have been lower
than expected numbers of deaths for non-COVID-19 reasons during the second wave
towards the end of 2020 and into 2021. Given that our results indicate that COVID-19 has had
a much larger impact on population health than chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but a
smaller one than ischaemic heart disease, it is unlikely that these sudden changes in
competing causes of death would change these conclusions. An excess of deaths due to
Alzheimer’s disease may bring DALYs due to Alzheimer’s closer, or slightly higher than our
lower limit estimate of COVID-19 DALYs, which again would not substantially alter our
conclusions.
Our disease model for health loss due to COVID-19 morbidity is based on a published
consensus method outlined by the European Burden of Disease Network and the ECDC. 20
This method can be adapted for both prevalence- or pathogen-based YLD calculations. In our
SBOD study, we largely use prevalence-based YLD calculations across our cause list, which
means that any future indirect effects from COVID-19 following infection in those with “long
COVID”, such as circulatory or respiratory conditions, would be attributed to their relevant
non-communicable disease group through prevalence estimates. As such, our range of
COVID-19 health states are fully comprehensive based on current evidence, which would not
have been the case had we adopted a pathogen-based approach to estimating YLD.
However, we acknowledge that estimates of the transition to, and duration of, post-acute
consequences remain largely uncertain.26-29 In our sensitivity analyses, we have shown that a
wide range of assumptions have a minimal impact on DALY estimates, given that YLD only
contributes around 2% to total DALYs. As further epidemiological information on post-acute
consequences emerge, they can be integrated into our estimation process to increase the
certainty of our point estimates of YLD.
There has been a debate over how values of YLL are assigned to those who have died. This
is centred on the idea that because deaths have mainly occurred in the elderly and frail,
including many care home residents, that aspirational or even average values derived from
national life tables may be unsuitable.8,30 An unrelated issue has also emerged, in that it has
been wrongly suggested that since the average age of death of COVID-19 was close to
estimates of the age of life expectancy at birth that those patients were likely to die soon.31
This overlooks the fact that remaining life expectancy increases as people survive to older
ages, so that estimates of life expectancy at birth do not apply to those who have survived
earlier mortality hazards. We have opted to use an aspirational life table for three reasons.
Burden of disease studies do not currently use lower life expectancy estimates for deaths that
8

occur in the elderly and frail, for example assigning lower values of life expectancy to
individuals with Alzheimer’s disease, so to do so for COVID-19 would be selective, and
comparability would be lost. DALYs are a measure of the health gap, rather than a health
expectancy, which by definition should be assessed relative to an aspirational counterfactual
scenario.32 Finally, as COVID-19 is a global issue there are great advantages in providing
data which is internationally comparable to facilitate reproducible research.
Implications for policy and research
The direct negative impact of COVID-19 on Scottish population health has been substantial.
Despite unprecedented mitigation efforts, a novel disease has developed from a single
identified case in the early months of spring 2020, to having the second largest population
health impact relative to all other health conditions. Unquestionably, the unprecedented extent
of mitigation approaches applied to reduce infection and death will have averted significant
further damage. Our estimates represent the actual impact on Scotland, rather than the
impact had national lockdowns, physical distancing, and other restrictive measures not been
implemented.
Burden of disease methodology offers an important opportunity for monitoring both the
indirect and direct impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of national lockdowns and
other restrictions, some factors may have improved, such as reductions in some other
infection types, or road accidents. However many will have worsened, such as mental health,
or the range of conditions impacted by reductions in physical activity. Estimation and
attribution of DALYs allows a common lens through which we can frame changes in the
population-level health impact of the pandemic on diseases, injuries and risk factors.
Due to the sensitive, and political, nature of the response to the pandemic, we advise that
countries calculate their own estimates of COVID-19 DALYs where they hold relevant data,
so that the inputs and methods are fully understood. If estimates are sourced from future
iterations of the GBD study, users must ensure that the inputs and outputs are representative
of their country-specific understanding of the occurrence, and severity, of infection, and the
number of deaths.33
As of December 2020, vaccination to tackle COVID-19 has commenced across the UK.34
Safe and effective vaccines will be the most powerful tool to tackle COVID-19 infection,
although non-pharmaceutical interventions are still required at present, and possibly in the
future. Periodic estimation of DALYs during 2021 and beyond is required. This, alongside
international comparisons, will provide indications of the fuller impact of COVID-19, and will
provide insights into the scale of DALYs, which are being averted due to the national rollout of
the vaccination programme, and other continued mitigation efforts. Furthermore, it is essential
for periodic estimation as the emergence of new variants, with at least increased
transmissibility, and their uncertainty may threaten our attempts to control infection.
Many studies have indicated that, on average, patients suffering from adverse outcomes and
death have had many prior co-morbidities. Although risk-outcome relationships have not yet
been developed, there is descriptive evidence that patients with prior exposure to metabolic
(such as obesity) and behavioural (such as tobacco smoking) risks, or with pre-existing comorbidities linked to these risks, were more likely to suffer from poorer outcomes from
infection.35,36 As such, we would expect a high proportion of COVID-19 DALYs, and YLL, to
be attributable to prior risk factors.
As the indirect harms, following attempts to control the COVID-19 pandemic, continue to
accumulate, there is an increasing need for rapid preventative action to recover and improve
population health and reduce inequalities in population health in Scotland.37 Prior to the
pandemic, improvements in population health in Scotland had faltered since 2012, with a
slowdown in the overall progress of reducing mortality and widening of socioeconomic
inequalities in mortality.38-40 Proactively building a healthier Scotland with lower levels and

9

milder forms of non-communicable disease will act as an important barrier in reducing any
direct or indirect harms from future epidemics or disasters.41-43
