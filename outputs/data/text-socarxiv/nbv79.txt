Abstract: By April 15th, 2020, more than 1.5 billion students worldwide experienced school closures in an effort to
slow the spread of a novel coronavirus, COVID-19, during a worldwide pandemic [1]. These interruptions in
formal educational experiences cause adverse consequences on school-age children’s academic outcomes [2]. We
found that the kindergarten children without formal education would gain 67% less (2.41 vs 7.23 points/100 days)
literacy ability compared to those with formal education. Compared to normal circumstances, kindergarten children
whose parents cannot read to them daily would gain 5.1 points of literacy ability from Jan 1st to Sept 1st, 2020 due
to COVID-19 school closures and lack of formal education. Our analysis showed that reading books daily to
children every day might mitigate 1.6 points or 31% of this potential loss. Educators and policy makers can
promote this simple solution to facilitate literacy ability improvement during school closures, which may be a
common occurrence as nations see the public health benefits of physical distancing for future pandemic outbreaks.

1. Introduction
To stop the spread of COVID-19, by April 15th, 91.3% of children enrolled in formal schooling - 1.5 billion
children worldwide from 192 countries - were ordered to stay home [1]. In the United States, 130,000+ school
closings impacted almost 57 million children. All fifty states in the U.S. had closed their schools for at least 3 weeks
and forty-nine states had closed all public and private schools for the rest of the 2019-20 academic year [3]. In these
unprecedented times, children will be out of school half as much as they were in school this academic year (~92
days out of 180 days) [4].
Many countries have implemented the school closure policy as an immediate response to the COVID-19
outbreak to reduce social contact [1]. The effectiveness of school closures on the spread of COVID-19 remains
unknown [5], yet the adverse consequences of school closures on children’s growth and development started to
appear soon afterwards [6–8]. Recent studies showed that children have fewer regular eating and sleeping patterns,
longer screen time, fewer physical activities, increased stress, and less social interaction during school closures,
which pose risk to their physical and mental health [8]. Among all the possible risks that COVID-19 school closures
pose on children’s physical and mental health, the United Nation Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) listed “interrupted learning” among the top adverse consequences of COVID-19 school closures [2].
Formal schooling – in person or remote - provides essential knowledge and skills for children’s growth and
development. Therefore, the interruption of formal education may cause negative impact on some children’s learning
outcomes, especially on disadvantaged children with unequal access to educational resources [2].
The effect of school closure on academic achievement has been studied in the summer months. This welldocumented, ‘summer slump’ shows that children lose the equivalent of approximately one month of literacy skills
when they are out of school during summer break [9]. The slump in literacy achievement is reduced by attending
summer school, visiting libraries, and/or participating in literacy-rich summer-based activities [9–13]. During

COVID-19 closures, these activities are not available to children so there is strong motivation to determine
alternatives that will reduce literacy loss.
A recent study predicted learning rates in reading and math during COVID-19 school closures in 3rd-7th grade
children in the U.S. [14]. They found that students only gained 63%-68% of grade-specific reading skills during the
2019-20 spring semester because of the interruption of the semester [14]. In our study, we focus on the impact of
school closures on kindergarten children because children’s formal education experience begins at kindergarten, and,
as such, children learn critical literacy skills then, such as phonological awareness and language structures, which set
the foundation for the future acquisition of literacy ability [15,16]. We use U.S. literacy scores to model the loss of
literacy skills in children during COVID-19 school closures, using data from a large national longitudinal study.
Furthermore, because of school closure and stay-at-home policies, children are spending more time at home
with their parents than they normally have [8]. Of note, the previous study on the loss of academic achievement
during COVID-19 school closures did not take mitigation strategies, such as home schooling or remote learning,
into consideration [14]. While staying at home may offer increased time to strengthen family bonds, parents are also
facing more challenges parenting full-time [8]. For example, they are not only ensuring their children’s health and
safety, but also monitoring their physical and emotional development and facilitating learning at home [17]. The
results of this study will provide parents a simple yet effective strategy to help mitigate the anticipated loss of
literacy ability of their kindergarten children. Our results will inform policy makers, educators, and parents as they
make decisions about how best to stimulate literacy skills during school closures, a likely staple of formal education
during future pandemics.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Data and sampling
The data used in this study were drawn from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of
2010-11 (ECLS-K:2011), sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The ECLS-K:2011 was
a longitudinal study of 18,170 children who started kindergarten in the 2010-11 school year from both private and
public schools. The same children were followed from kindergarten to fifth grade (2015-16 school year). Data from
multiple sources (e.g., child, family, school, and community) were collected through direct assessments, interviews,
and questionnaires. Multi-stage sampling design was used to determine a nationally representative sample [18,19].
During data screening and cleaning, we excluded the participants that had incomplete key information (e.g., scaled
scores, parent questionnaire answers, etc.).
The sample used in the current study had 3,170 children (Table 1). The scores we used in our analyses were
drawn from kindergarten fall, kindergarten spring, 1st grade fall, and 1st grade spring reading scaled score. Data on
reading-related summer activities were collected through the 1st grade fall semester parent questionnaire.

2.2 Literacy outcome measures

The ECLS-K:2011 used a screening test and two-stage assessment to measure reading and language skills
[18,19]. The purpose of the two-stage design was to optimize measuring accuracy and administration time. The
reading assessments were based on the 2019 National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) Reading
Framework. Each child completed a thirty-minute computer-assisted language screening and reading assessment.
The language screener included two tasks from the Preschool Language Assessment Scale task (preLAS 2003) that
measured receptive and expressive language proficiency. Students who passed the language screening or who spoke
English as home language proceeded to the reading assessment. The reading assessment tested children’s ability in
basic reading skills (e.g., phonological awareness, familiarity with print, letter/word recognition, and sight word),
expressive and receptive vocabulary, and reading comprehension (e.g., recalling, interpretation, and evaluation).
Language and literacy assessments used in the ECLS-K:2011 besides preLAS were Peabody Picture Vocabulary

Test – 3rd Edition (PPVT-III), Test of Early Reading Ability – 3rd edition (TERA-3), and Test of Preschool Early
Literacy (TOPEL) [18,19].
The ECLS-K:2011 used the item analyses to calculate composite scores to quantify literacy abilities, so that the
scores were comparable between children [18,19]. Because this process comprised a battery of assessments of
reading and language, we refer to the composite as “literacy abilities”.
2.3 Data analysis
2.3.1 Rates of literacy ability changes
We used the multivariate linear regression with the ordinary least square method [20] to obtain the rates of
literacy ability changes using the literacy scale score from the four assessments taken during kindergarten and 1st
grade (Section 2.1). The linear model was interpreted as

y! i = β0 + β1 x1i + β2 x 2i + β3 x 3i + εi
or

y! = X β + ε
where i! represented the individual participant, y! i was the literacy scale score, β
! 0 was the reference level of literacy
activity score at the first assessment (i.e., intercept of the linear model), x! 1i and β
! 1 were the number of days and the
rate of literacy ability gain in the kindergarten after the first assessment, x! 2i and β
! 2 are the number of days and the
rate of literacy ability gain during the summer vacation between kindergarten and 1st grade, x 3i and β3 were the
number of days and the rate of literacy ability gain during the 1st grade, εi was a random error.
The rates of literacy ability gain and corresponding covariance matrices were estimated as:

^ = (X′ X )−1 X′y

Figure 1. The number densities of literacy scale scores are shown as the colored hexagons. The red line represents
the fitted literacy scale score changes using all available data.

2.3.2 Differences between rates of literacy ability changes
The differences between the rates of literacy ability changes during summer and kindergarten (!β2 − β1) and the
differences between the rates of literacy ability changes during summer and 1st grade (β2 − β3) are then calculated
using the corresponding vectors a
! 1 = [0, − 1, 1, 0] and !a 2 = [0, 0, 1, − 1] such that a
! 1 β = β2 − β1 and
!a 2 β = β2 − β3. Let z! 1 = a1 β and z! 2 = a 2 β, we have

^
!z^1 = a1 β
^ a′
! r (z^1) = a1Va r (β
Va
) 1
^
!z^2 = a 2 β
^ a′
! r (z^2) = a 2Va r (β
Va
) 2
Furthermore, let !t1 =

z^1

Va r (z^1)

and t! 2 =

z^2

Va r (z^2)

, t! 1 and t! 2 should both follow a t-distribution with

degrees of freedom of n-4 and we can then derive the p-value from the t-distribution.
2.3.3 Rates of literacy ability changes from different factors
To assess the effects on the rate of literacy ability changes from different factors (e.g., reading frequencies), we
partitioned the data by the factor categories, and calculated the rates of literacy ability changes in each partition of
the data, respectively, as follows:

y! ij = β0j + β1 j x1ij + β2 j x 2ij + β3j x 3ij + εij , j = 0,1, 2,…
or

y! j = Xj βj + εj , j = 0,1, 2,…
where j! represents the specific category (e.g., reading to child every day).
3. Results
3.1 Loss of literacy score gain due to COVID-19 school closures
We used the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010-11 (ECLS-K:2011) data [18,19]
to assess the effect of school closures on the rates of literacy ability changes of kindergarten children. Using a
multivariate linear regression model (Section 2.3.1), we calculated the rate of literacy ability change, measured by
literacy scale scores, during kindergarten spring semester as β1 = 7.23 ± 0.19 points per 100 days across the nation
(Table 2). During the summer vacation, children received no formal education from schools and the rate of literacy
ability change decreased to β2 = 2.41 ± 0.55 points per 100 days, significantly lower than the rate during
kindergarten (p<0.001, Section 2.3.2). Assuming that the rate of literacy ability change of kindergarten children

during COVID-19 school closures is the same as that during the summer vacation between kindergarten and 1st
grade (i.e., β2), the rate of literacy ability gain would decrease from 7.23 by 67% to 2.41 points per 100 days.

Without COVID-19 school closures, the averaged literacy ability in kindergarten children would improve by
13.9 points from Jan 1st to Sept 1st, 2020 (the approximate start of 1st grade fall semester). To control the spread of
COVID-19, most of the states have enforced school closures starting the week of March 16th. Assuming that there
were no effective alternatives of formal education since then, the averaged literacy ability gain for these
kindergarten children (dotted line in Figure 2A) would change to 9.5 points from Jan 1st to Sept 1st, 2020, decreased
by 32% than that without COVID-19 school closures (grey line in Figure 2A).

kindergarten spring semester, COVID-19 school closures, and 2020 1st grade fall semester. Panel B shows the predicted

change of literacy scale score since Mar 16th, 2020 during school closures of children whose parents read to them at
different frequencies.

3.2 Effect of reading books to children every day on literacy ability improvement
Many activities proven to mitigate literacy loss during school closures – summer school, library visits, and
summer literacy activities – are not available because of COVID-19 closures [9–11,13]. Therefore, we investigated
on the effect of reading books to children at home on literacy ability improvement, which is an activity that can be
accomplished during COVID-19 closures. The ECLS-K:2011 data set included parents’ estimates of how frequently
they read to their child during the summer months. They were given four options in the questionnaire: not at all,
once or twice, 3-6 times per week, and every day. Results from the linear model (Section 2.3.3) showed that the
more frequently children were read to, the more literacy abilities they gained during summertime school closures
(Table 2 and Figure 2). Children whose parents read to them every day had the highest rate of literacy ability change
of β2 = 2.94 ± 0.83 points per 100 days, 47% higher than the children whose parents cannot do so
(β2 = 2.00 ± 0.47 points per 100 days) (Table 2 and Figure 2b). Children whose parents never read to them had the
lowest rate of literacy ability change (β2 = − 1.42 ± 4.83 points per 100 days, note that the large uncertainty was
due to its small sample size).
Based on these results, we predicted that children whose parents read to them every day will gain 10.4 points
from Jan 1st to Sept 1st, 2020 despite COVID-19 school closures. In comparison, children whose parents cannot read
to them every day and those whose parents never read to them will gain 8.8 and 3.9 points during the same period,
respectively (Figure 2). Compared to the business-as-usual scenario without COVID-19 school closures, children
whose parents read to them every day would gain 3.5 points less while those whose parents cannot do so would gain
5.1 points less. This suggests that the parents’ efforts in reading to child every day may mitigate about 31% (or 1.6
points) of the potential loss in literacy ability gain.
4. Discussion
We used data from a large, U.S. longitudinal study to predict that kindergarten children will have 67% less
literacy ability gain during COVID-19 school closures than they would normally have. Our results are consistent
with previous studies on summer slump. Cooper et al. revealed that, at best, students showed no loss during summer,
but at worst, they lost one-month of grade level equivalent literacy skills, which is consistent with the worst-case
scenario (never read to child) in this study [9].
Past studies showed that literacy loss over the summer can be mitigated by educational efforts such as intensive
summer instructions and frequent library visits [11]; however, those options are not available during COVID-19
closures. Even though many school used distant learning, limited resources for this type of learning (e.g., computers,
tablets, education applications, remote learning platforms, quiet space, internet access) are more likely than lack of
books for daily reading, especially for children living in low social-economic status families [21,22].
Two recent studies examined the impact of COVID-19 school closures on academic outcomes in various
subject, grades, and countries from different perspectives [14,23]. Kuhfeld et al. showed that 3rd-7th grade students
will loss approximately 35% of reading learning gains compared to they would have had gained in a typical school
year [14]. They suggested that the loss in reading ability is unbalanced among students, with the top students losing
less [14]. Azevedo et al. predicted academic outcome from a financial perspective in different school closure
scenarios (schools closed for 3, 5, and 7 months with various levels of effectiveness of the mitigation strategies)
[23]. They concluded that when schools are closed for 5 months, primary and secondary school students in the
current cohort will loss on average ~ $900 yearly income individually, which equals to a present value of $10 trillion
worldwide [23]. They suggested that governments should take actions to build and implement safe and effective
post-COVID education plans to ensure the continuity of the formal education in schools and at home [23].

Besides estimating the loss of literacy ability, our study also provided evidence that reading daily to young
children may help mitigate literacy loss during COVID-19 school closures. Our recommendation of reading to
children is supported by previous studies, which showed that book reading can mitigate summer slump [12,24].
Reading to children daily is a low-tech strategy to prevent the adverse consequences of COVID-19 school closures
while strengthening family bonds. Kindergarten children, who have limited ability to read independently, depend on
adults to provide access to books through read-alouds. These read-alouds provide, ‘book-language,’ which is higher
in sentence complexity and school vocabulary than conversations and oral storytelling [25,26]. Reading-aloud also
provides an opportunity to practice word reading and interaction with text around letters and sounds, even if reading
the same book multiple times [24].
There are two limitations worth noting in the current study: First, previous studies have shown that the
interruption of formal education has unequal effect on children with or without disadvantages (e.g., poverty and
disability) [23,27,28]. However, to provide a big picture estimate of the impact of school closures, our analysis
included kindergarten children from all social-economic status in the sample. Future researches are needed to
examine the degree of impact of COVID-19 school closures on children living in different socioeconomic
backgrounds. Second, since the start of school closures, parents and educators are actively seeking the best way to
facilitate learning remotely [29]. Many studies have reported on the pros and cons of remote learning [29–31].
Therefore, in this study, we considered the effectiveness of an alternative – reading books at home - for mitigating
literacy loss, which is especially valuable for children and families who have limited access to remote learning
resources.
With an anticipated “second-wave” of COVID-19 cases, many states have slowed down or paused their
reopening plans [32]. Our study predicted that kindergarten children would generally have 32% loss of literacy
ability gain from Jan 1st to Sept 1st, 2020, assuming schools will reopen in the fall semester. However, if schools
remain closed or reopen partially, based on our current prediction, the adverse effect of school closures will be more
pronounced. Formal schooling through active online learning will likely yield the greatest maintenance of literacy
skills but until schools have robust, evidence-based systems for delivering high-quality online learning, reading to
children is an effective low-tech alternative, which could also promote a love of books and social-emotional
connections between parents and children.
5. Conclusions
In an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19, 192 countries ordered school closures, which impacted more than
1.5 billion students worldwide [1]. In our study, we used longitudinal data to quantify literacy ability loss during
COVID-19 school closures. We predicted that kindergarten children will have 67% less literacy ability gain during
COVID-19 school closures than they would have had without the school closures. We estimated that the average
gain of literacy score in kindergarten children during Jan 1st – Sept 1st, 2020 will decrease from 13.9 to 9.5 for lack
of formal education. Many activities have shown to mitigate literacy loss during school closures (e.g., summer
school, summer literacy programs, visiting libraries) are not available because of COVID-19 closures [9,13]. Our
analysis showed that reading books to children every day – a simple home activity - can mitigate 31% of the loss.
Reading books to children is commonly used as a mitigation of literacy loss [22]. We recommended this low-tech
and effective solution to prevent the adverse consequences of school closures while promoting a love of books and
social-emotional connections between parents and children. We hope that our results will inform policy makers,
educators, and parents as they make decisions about how best to stimulate literacy skills during school closures, a
likely staple of formal education during future pandemics.
