Abstract
Background. This study aimed to determine whether crime patterns in Mexico City changed due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, and to test whether any changes observed were associated with the disruption of
routine activities.
Method. The first objective was assessed by comparing the observed incidence of crime after the COVID-19
pandemic was detected in the country with that expected based on ARIMA forecasts based on the prepandemic trends. The second objective was assessed by examining the association between crime incidence
and the number of passengers on public transport using regressions with ARIMA errors.
Results. Results indicated that most crime categories decreased significantly after the pandemic was detected in the country or after a national lockdown was instituted. Furthermore, the study found that most
of the declines observed were associated with the reductions seen in public transport passenger numbers.
However, the declines predicted by the changes in mobility were not always consistent nor as large as those
observed.
Conclusion. The findings contribute to the global evaluation of the effects of COVID-19 on crime and
propose a robust method to explictily test whether the changes observed are associated with changes in
routine activities.

Introduction
In an effort to counter the spread of COVID-19 governments and communities around the
world have implemented local, regional and national ‘lockdowns,’ in which non-essential
activities have been severely curtailed and people have been ordered to stay at home. Lock∗

downs are an extreme measure used to enforce social distancing, and research has shown that
they have been effective in slowing the pandemic (Flaxman et al., 2020; Lau et al., 2020).
Because lockdowns have radically and drastically changed most social aspects of human
life, it is widely assumed that they also have affectted other social phenomena. The shift
of activity from public to private places drastically affects the opportunity structures of
many crime types. For example, street robbery is less likely to occur if streets are empty,
shoplifting is impossible if shops are closed, and burglary involves greater risks if homes are
always occupied. On the other hand, the confinement of people in a household can increase
the risk of other crimes; in particular, diverse forms of domestic violence may be more likely,
as victims cannot escape abusive partners.
The potential effects of pandemic-related lockdowns on crime have generated much academic
interest. However, to date little research has been conducted outside of a few select countries
that tend to be over-represented in criminological research: the US (Ashby, 2020a, 2020b;
Campedelli, Aziani, & Favarin, 2020; Mohler et al., 2020; Piquero et al., 2020; Shayegh
& Malpede, 2020), Europe (Buil-Gil, Miró-llinares, Moneva, & Dı́az-Castaño, 2020; Gerell,
Kardell, & Kindgren, 2020; Halford, Dixon, Farrell, Malleson, & Tilley, 2020), and Australia (Payne, Morgan, & Piquero, 2020).
Though, overall these studies have generally found decreases in crime associated with the
pandemic, it is unclear if these patterns have also been seen in regions with vastly different
criminogenic conditions. For example, the incidence and prevalence of crime in Latin America
and the Caribbean is much higher than in the rest of the world (Muggah & Tobón, 2019), and
crime phenomena occur in a context where governance is contested between non-state violent
actors and the state (Müller, 2018). Furthermore, it is expected that the pandemic will wreak
havoc in the economy and stability of countries in the region. The UN Economic Commission
for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) estimates that the pandemic “will cause the

2

greatest economic contraction ever,” cause unemployment to increase to 38 million, and
drive 30 million people to poverty in the region (ECLAC, 2020). The combination of high
crime rates, deteriorating social and economic conditions, as well as changes in illicit markets
and criminal governance prompted by the crisis (Asmann, Dalby, & Robbins, 2020; FelbabBrown, 2020) beg the question of whether crime phenomena will react in the same way in
Latin America as in the rest of the countries studied.
Studying the effects of the pandemic on crime in Latin America and the Caribbean is important for two main reasons. First, crime is a highly salient issue in the region and it is
relevant to study if any changes observed during this period are related to the pandemic. For
example, on July 28, 2020, Mexico’s security ministry claimed that they had achieved a 22%
reduction in robberies against businesses during the first six months of the year, without
acknowledging that during three of those months most businesses were closed or had gone
out of businesses due to the lockdown.1 Second, the lockdown is the “largest criminological
experiment in history” (Stickle & Felson, 2020), and thus represents a golden opportunity
to test whether the theories that have been developed to explain crime in the ‘developed’
world are also suitable to explain crime in other regions.
Focusing on Mexico City, this study aims to determine if crime patterns changed due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, and to test whether any changes observed were associated with the
disruption of routine activities. The study proceeds as follows: In the next section I present
a brief overview of the theoretical framework that motivates the study. Then I describe the
data and methods used in the study, and follow with the results. This is followed by the
discussion and conclusions.

Routine activities, lockdowns and crime
Cohen and Felson (1979) proposed the routine activity approach to explain the increase
in crime in the United States after WWII—when improvements in social conditions would
have predicted crime to decrease—noting that the dispersion of activities away from suburban
households in the postwar period generated many crime opportunities for property crime (see
also, Felson, 2017). Drawing on Hawley’s (1950) human ecological theory, the routine
activity approach did not see crimes as indicators of a malfunctioning society, but rather as
a feature of everyday life.
The fundamental premise of this approach is that crime events are the product of crime
opportunities, which occur when a likely offender converges with a suitable target in the
absence of a capable guardian. In turn, the rate at which crime opportunities occur is
a function of the routine activities that structure everyday life—e.g. work, leisure, school,
family, etc. It then follows that social changes that alter routine activities can have dramatic
effects on crime, even if the social factors that presumably drive criminal motivation (such
as poverty and unemployment) remain stable.
While it was originally proposed to explain a crime increase, the routine activity approach
has also been useful to explain the crime drop seen in many developed countries since the
turn of the 21st century, as security improvements reduced target suitability for several types
of predatory crime (Farrell, Tilley, & Tseloni, 2014; Farrell, Tilley, Tseloni, & Mailley, 2010;
Farrell, Tseloni, Mailley, & Tilley, 2011; Farrell, Tseloni, & Tilley, 2011; Tilley, Farrell, &
Clarke, 2015).
The most noticeable change in routine activities due to COVID-19 is a dramatic reduction in
activity levels in public spaces, as people were mandated to stay at home to reduce contagion.
This reduction in mobility is unlikely to affect all crime types in the same way. Crimes that

4

take place in public (e.g. street robberies) are likely to decrease, as there are fewer likely
offenders and suitable targets on the street due to the lockdown. On the other hand, crimes
that take place inside households (e.g. domestic violence) may increase, as victims are less
able to escape offenders living in the same household.
To date there have been a few studies of the effects of COVID-19 related lockdowns on crime.
Ashby (2020b) used ARIMA forecasting to compare the estimated incidence of crime given
pre-COVID-19 trends with the counts in 16 US cities after COVID-19 was detected in the
country. The study found no significant changes in serious assaults, reductions in burglary
in some cities, little change in non-residential burglary (except in one city), decreases in
thefts from vehicles, and diverging effects on thefts of vehicles. Halford et al. (2020) used
a similar modeling approach to estimate the effect of COVID-19 lockdowns on crime in one
UK police area, and found that all crime had declined dramatically by one week after the
lockdown. Similarly, Payne et al. (2020) used ARIMA forecasting to estimate the effect
of lockdowns on crime in Queensland, Australia, and found significant declines assault and
sexual assault, though domestic violence patterns were not affected. Campedelli et al. (2020)
used Bayesian structural time-series models to estimate the effect of social distancing policies
on crime in Los Angeles and found significant decreases in overall crime, robbery, shoplifting,
theft and battery. Mohler et al. (2020) used regression analysis to estimate the difference
in mean calls for service before and after COVID-19 related lockdowns in Indianapolis and
Los Angeles, and found modest reductions in some crime types, though not consistently
across places. In contrast, Shayegh and Malpede (2020) used an econometric time series
model to estimate the effect of lockdown orders in San Francisco and Oakland, finding a
large 40% reduction in crime in both cities, though they found no reduction in domestic
violence. Specifically regarding domestic violence, Piquero et al. (2020) used regressions and
ARIMA forecasting to analyze the effect of lockdowns on domestic violence in Dallas. Their
study found short-term increases in domestic violence in the two weeks after the lockdown,
5

though the increases appear to predate the policy (possibly due to people reducing their
mobility before official lockdown orders were issued). Gerell et al. (2020) used monthly
crime projections inferred from previous years and found that total crime, assaults, pickpocketing and burglary decreased significantly in Sweden, though reductions were somewhat
modest.
All of the studies cited consider the changes in crime observed to be (at least partially)
associated with the shifts in mobility following lockdowns, as predicted by the routine activity
approach. However, most studies did not explicitly examine the association between changes
in mobility and changes in crime, and instead used discrete before and after periods to identify
changes in crime patterns. Two exceptions are Mohler et al. (2020) and Halford et al. (2020),
who in addition to using discrete time periods, also examined the relationship between crime
and a mobility index. Both of these studies used Google’s COVID-19 Community Mobility
Reports as a measure of the change in routine activities due to COVID-19 related lockdowns
(as well as capturing voluntary reductions in mobility prior to lockdowns being officially
mandated). Mohler et al. (2020) used a regression model to explicitly estimate the effect on
crime of a change in daily mobility, while Halford et al. (2020) used total changes in mobility
observed for the study period to calculate the ‘Mobility Elasticity of Crime’ (MEC)—which
captures the proportional change in crime for a one percent change in mobility.
There are, however, important limitations to these studies. The first is that the Google
mobility indices are only available from early 2020, thus it is not possible to examine the
relationship between crime and mobility over a longer time period. The second is that the
the indices do not reflect absolute changes in mobility, but rather are deviations from the
median values for each day of the week between Jan 3 and Feb 6, 2020 (Halford et al., 2020),
making interpretation less transparent. Lastly, the methods used by Mohler et al. (2020) and
Halford et al. (2020) to quantify the relationship between crime and mobility did not take

6

into account the time series structure of the data, which can lead to spurious results (see
Box-Steffensmeier, Freeman, Hitt, & Pevehouse, 2014). Thus, estimating the relationship
between mobility and crime, in the context of COVID-19, requires a longer mobility time
series, a more transparent mobility measure, and a more sophisticated modeling approach.

Data and methods
The data used in this study was obtained from Mexico City’s open data portal.2 Crime
incidents were classified into six broad categories—as well as an “all crimes” category—and
aggregated by date of occurrence to construct 7 time series of daily crime counts covering
the period from Jan. 1, 2017 to May 24, 2020.3 The crime categories used were:
• All crimes.
• Violent robbery,
• Non-violent robbery.
• Robbery against residence.4
• Serious violent crime (non-sexual).5
• Sexual violence.6
• Domestic violence.
The crime categories were chosen in an attempt to capture how the changes in routine activities prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic could affect the different opportunity structures
underpinning various crime types. In particular, it was hypothesized that crimes that tend
to disproportionally affect women more than men (i.e. sexual and domestic violence) were
likely to increase as people were confined in their homes (and thus victimized women were

more likely to be trapped with their abusers). However, as sexual and domestic violence
tend to be underreported, I used calls to a women’s helpline operated by the Mexico City
government to triangulate the amount of violence against women (VAW).
Though the helpline advises women on a range of issues, I selected only those calls that were
related to gender-related violence7 and constructed time series with daily counts of calls from
Jan. 1, 2017 to May 24, 2020.
Lastly, to estimate the changes in routine activities associated with the pandemic, I used
figures on the daily number of passengers on two of Mexico City’s largest public transport
systems: the Metrobus bus rapid transit (BRT), and the Metro (SCT). Though there are
additional public transport systems in the city (including several light rail, bus, tram and
bike sharing systems), passenger data for the entire period studied was only available for
BRT and SCT. After excluding passenger numbers for lines opened after Jan. 1, 2017,
passenger numbers from both services were combined into a daily time series.
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the period before COVID-19 was detected in the
country (Jan. 1, 2017 to Feb. 28, 2020), after COVID-19 was detected (Feb. 29, to May
24, 2020), as well as for the entire period. Figure 1 plots the time series for each variable
from Jan. 1 to May 24, for 2017 to 2020. The plots also feature dashed lines indicating two
significant dates: the day the first COVID-19 cases were reported in the country (Feb. 29,
2020), and the day the national mandated lockdown began (Mar. 23, 2020).
All crimes, all robbery types, and serious violent crimes experienced marked declines after
the pandemic began in Mexico. As Table 1 indicates, these crimes decreased by between
29.1% and 52.6%. In contrast, sexual and domestic violence increased by a small amount,
and VAW helpline calls appear to have jumped by 84.8%. The time series in Figure 1 for
all crimes, robberies, and serious violent crimes suggest that the declines for these crimes

were associated with the pandemic, as the downward trends begin about two weeks after
the first cases were detected in the country and they stabilise at a low level about 3 weeks
after the lockdown. In contrast, the time series for sexual and domestic violence, and for
VAW helpline calls suggest that these crimes were trending upward before the effects of
the pandemic would be expected (late January and early February). Sexual and domestic
violence peaked in the last weeks of February and in early March, remained at an elevated
level through March, and declined after the lockdown (though they remained at roughly the
same levels seen in 2017-2019). VAW helpline calls peaked in late February, remained at an
elevated level the first half of March, and experienced two further peaks in the second half of
March. Calls then dipped following the lockdown for about two weeks, and in April they rose
to the level seen in late February (a level higher than that seen in previous years). Lastly,
Table 1 and Figure 1 also show how daily passenger numbers changed in response to the
pandemic: the mean daily number of passengers using Mexico City’s BRT and SCT systems
decreased by 53.8% compared with the period from Jan. 1, 2017 to Feb. 28, 2020. The
patterns suggest that the decline in urban mobility began about a week before the official
lockdown was mandated and stabilised below 2 million passengers per day from mid April
onward.
While the exploratory analyses suggest that the declines seen in all crimes, robberies and
serious violent crimes were likely to be associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, they do
not unambiguously suggest that the increases in sexual and domestic violence, and VAW
calls were causally associated with the pandemic, as they predate the first cases of COVID19 in the country. According to González Schont (2020), the increase in VAW calls (and
presumably in sexual and domestic violence crime reports as well) before the pandemic could
be explained by the fact that it coincided with events related to International Women’s Day
(March 8th), which included publicity campaigns to increase awareness of domestic violence
as well as massive protests staged by women in response to government inaction to counter
9

rising levels of femicides and violence against women (Averbuch, 2020; Phillips, 2020). Thus,
it is possible that the increases reflect women’s heightened awareness of the VAW helpline
and more willingness to report abuse, or they could also reflect true increases in the incidence
of violence against women associated with a backlash effect, as a deeply patriarchal society
responds violently to the feminist movement (González Schont, 2020).
In any case, these exploratory analyses do not take into account the complex time series
patterns present in the data which require more sophisticated modeling approaches outlined
in the following sections.

ARIMA forecasting
As Ashby (2020b) notes, determining the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on crime requires
comparing the observed incidence with that expected in the absence of the pandemic. However, because the pandemic is by definition a global event, there are no suitable locations
that could be used as controls as is common in natural experiments. Thus, to estimate a suitable counterfactual expectation, I used autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)
forecasting models with seasonal components. Time series forecast models are based on the
fundamental notion that past observations of a phenomenon are generally good predictors
of future observations (Box-Steffensmeier et al., 2014). Because the past tends to affect the
future in complex (sometimes simultaneous) short, medium and long term dependency pro-

cesses (Box-Steffensmeier et al., 2014), ARIMA models seek to capture this complexity by
specifying the number of non-seasonal and seasonal autoregressive, integration, and moving
average parameters—denoted as ARIM A(p, d, q) × (P, D, Q)period —required to reduce the
time series to a white noise process.
In this study, and following Ashby (2020b), ARIMA parameters were automatically selected
using an algorithm outlined by Hyndman (2010), which selects the parameters that minimize
the Akaike information criterion (AIC), using the ‘fable’ package (O’Hara-Wild, Hyndman,
& Wang, 2020) in R (R Core Development Team, 2015). ARIMA models were trained
using the period before the pandemic (Jan. 1, 2017 to Feb. 28, 2020). Most crime types
were adequately modelled by a pure ARIMA process with a stochastic trend, though a
deterministic trend (i.e. a dummy time counter) offered a better fit for sexual and domestic
violence, and VAW helpline calls (see Table 2 for the final specifications used). Because
the variables used are counts with a lower bound of 0, the dependent variable was logtransformed.
The models were then used to forecast the values and 95% confidence intervals expected
for all days between Feb. 29 to May 24, 2020. To summarize the effect of the pandemic,
I calculated the percentage change between the observed and forecast values. To calculate
confidence intervals for these estimated changes, I also calculated the percentage change
between the observed value and the upper and lower bounds of the forecast confidence
interval.

Crime-mobility models
Estimating the relationship between two longitudinal variables without adequately accounting for their time series properties can easily lead to a ‘spurious regression’, where it is
falsely concluded that there are significant relationships between unrelated non-stationary

12

variables (Box-Steffensmeier et al., 2014). Furthermore, the presence of autocorrelation in
the error terms can bias infrences. Thus, to estimate the relationship between crime and mobility, I used linear models with non-seasonal and seasonal ARIMA errors (Hyndman, 2010;
Hyndman & Athanasopoulos, 2019). The general form of the models used (in backshift
notation) is:

log(yt ) = βlog(xt ) +

θ(B)Θ(B 7 )
zt
φ(B)Φ(B 7 )

where yt and xt are the time series of the dependent and independent variables, β is the coefficient estimate quantifying the relationship between yt and xt , φ and θ are the non-seasonal
autoregressive and moving average terms, while, Φ and Θ are the autoregressive and moving
average terms for weekly seasonal effects, B is the backshift operator, and zt are the white
noise residuals. If differencing is required to control for (non-seasonal) integration,8 φ(B) is
replaced by ∇d φ(B), where ∇ is the differencing operator (1−B) (Hyndman, 2010; Hyndman
& Athanasopoulos, 2019). It is relevant to note that this differencing procedure is equivalent
to fitting a model with ARMA errors to differenced time series of yt and xt (Hyndman, 2010).
Selection of the number of ARIMA error terms followed the same automatic approach as
that outlined in the previous section. Similarly, I also tested whether deterministic trends
were required. After an initial estimation, residuals were checked for autocorrelation using
the Ljung-Box test (Ljung & Box, 1978) at 21 lags, and for stationarity using the KPSS
test (Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt, & Shin, 1992). These tests revealed that the automatically selected ARIMA parameters for all crimes, violent robbery, serious violent crime,
domestic violence, and VAW helpline calls were inadequate, as the residuals were autocorrelated and there were indications of non-stationarity. Thus, I fitted further ARIMA models
8
As the models with ARIMA errors estimated did not exhibit seasonal integration, only the non-seasonal
case is described here.

13

manually selecting parameters for these crime types until the residuals resembled a white
noise process.
As the dependent and independent variables are log-transformed, the mobility coefficient is
approximately the percentage change expected in y for a 1% change in x (Wooldridge, 2013),
and it thus represents a more robust measure of the Mobility Elasticity of Crime reported
by Halford et al. (2020). For example, if the mobility coefficient were 1.5, it would mean that
crimes increase (decrease) 1.5% for a 1% increase (decrease) in mobility. To estimate the
effect for different magnitude (for example for a 50% reduction in mobility), the following
expression can be used: 0.5β . Thus, for a hypothetical mobility coefficient of 1.5, crimes
would be expected to decrease by 55% for a 50% reduction in mobility (0.51.5 = 0.45).
The crime-mobility models with ARIMA errors were fitted to the entire observation period
(Jan. 1, 2017 to May 24, 2020), though additional models fitted to the pre- and post-COVID19 periods were estimated to check if the relationship between crime and mobility was robust
to the effect of the pandemic.

Results
ARIMA forecasting
The specifications and accuracy measures of the ARIMA forecasting models are shown in
Table 2, while the forecasts and confidence intervals are shown in Figure 2. Looking at
the results shown in Table 2 first, the (in-sample) accuracy measures for the pre-COVID-19
period suggest that the ARIMA models captured the complexity of the time series to a
reasonable extent. In contrast, the (out-of-sample) accuracy measures for the post-COVID19 periods provide a first estimate of the effect of the pandemic: The mean error for all

14

variables (except VAW helpline calls) is negative, indicating that the observed values were
consistently smaller than those expected before the pandemic.
While the overall patterns shown in Figure 2 broadly agree with those shown in the exploratory analysis presented earlier (see Figure 1), the 95% confidence interval permits making a more robust comparison to the counterfactual. The aggregated “all crimes” variable
began gradually declining about two weeks after the first COVID-19 cases were detected in
Mexico, though the decline was only significantly different from the forecast from about 3
days after the lockdown began and remained at a significantly low level for the duration of the
study period. Violent robbery similarly declined significantly for the majority of the study
period, though the decline began about a week later—after the lockdown was instituted—and
was statistically significant from early April onward. In contrast, the decline in non-violent
robbery appears to have started about a week before the lockdown, and was similarly significant from early April throughout the rest of the period, except for one day. Robbery
against residence followed a very similar pattern, though there were more days in which
the decline was not significant, and the last days of the period suggested a slight upward
trend. In contrast with most other crimes, serious violent crimes declined more abruptly in
early April after remaining fairly stable during March. Furthermore, while serious violent
crimes remained at a low level throughout the rest of the period, many observations were
not significantly lower than the expected incidence.
Sexual violence appeared to have declined gradually from about a week before the lockdown
and stabilized at a low level from early April onward. While many observations were significantly lower than expected, the observations were generally close to the lower bound of
the expected threshold. Domestic violence had a significant peak right after the first cases
of COVID-19 were detected in the country, though as stated earlier, this is unlikely to be
causally related to the pandemic. The incidence of domestic violence remained at the ex-

15

pected level through March, began declining after the lockdown, though the declines were
only consistently significant until late April onward. The forecast for VAW helpline calls
suggests that the peaks observed before COVID-19 cases were detected in the country, and
which continued through March, were anomalous and unlikely to be related to the pandemic.
The incidence of VAW calls appears to have dropped to the expected levels after the lockdown, dip for about a week in late March and early April, and increase to a level higher
than that expected afterwards—though observations were consistently within the expected
forecast intervals.
The final plot in Figure 2 shows the effect of the pandemic on urban mobility. The observed
number of passengers using public transport shows a gradual decline about two weeks after
the first cases of COVID-19 were detected in the country when compared with the forecast.
The decline became statistically significant around the date of the lockdown and remained
at a stable and statistically significant low level for the remainder of the study period.

can be found in the Appendix) for two periods: The ‘post-COVID-19’ period from Feb. 29
to May 24, 2020; and the post lockdown period from Mar, 23 to May 24, 2020. All crimes
declined by 30.6% during the post-COVID-10 period, and by 42.7% after the lockdown,
and as the confidence interval did not cross 0%, the declines were statistically significant.
Similarly, violent robberies declined significantly by 31.0% and 42.7% during the two periods.
The overall decline for non-violent robbery during the entire post-COVID-19 period was
30.9%, though the confidence interval suggests that this decline was not significant. However,
if we only consider the post lockdown period, the 42.2% decline was statistically significant.
Robbery against residence decreased significantly by 45.6% and 58.6% during the postCOVID-19 and post lockdown periods, respectively. While the total incidence of serious

violent crimes decreased by 27.1% and 39.0% during both periods, the declines were not
statistically significant, as the confidence intervals cross 0%.
Sexual violence declined by 53.3% during the post-COVID-19 period (though it was not
statistically significant), and by a statistically significant 66.5% after the lockdown. Similarly,
domestic violence was down by a non-significant 26.0% during the entire post-COVID-19
period, and by a (marginally) significant 36.5% after the lockdown. In contrast with all
other crimes, total VAW helpline calls increased by 27.6% and 18.15% over the expected
during the two periods, though these increases were not statistically significant.
Lastly, the number of passenger numbers using the BRT and SCT public transport systems decreased by 53.3% and 68.1% during the post-COVID-19 and post lockdown periods,
respectively. Both estimates were found to be statistically significant.

Crime-mobility models
The main results of the crime-mobility models with ARIMA errors are shown in Table 3.
Overall, all models were reasonably accurate and achieved a good fit. Ljung-Box Q statistics
suggested autocorrelation was not significant overall for most crimes. The only exception was
VAW helpline calls, where the Q statistic indicated (marginally) significant autocorrelation
(p = 0.048), despite attempts to eliminate it trying different ARIMA specifications.9 This
means that, for VAW helpline calls, the standard error for the mobility coefficient may be
somewhat biased—though the coefficient is correctly estimated—thus interpretation should
be conducted with caution. On the other hand, the errors for all variables showed no signs
of non-stationarity as all KPSS test statistics were not significant.

9

An inspection of the VAW helpline calls residuals indicate that there was a cluster of significant lags
at days 7 to 10, which could indicate a complex process of event dependence: for example, victims may be
asked to call again in 10 days time for follow ups.

KPSS

In general, mobility coefficients were significantly and positively associated with crime incidence, with the exception of robbery against residence and domestic violence, as their
mobility coefficients were not statistically significant. Nonetheless, the association between
mobility and crime was inelastic. A 1% increase in mobility was associated with a 0.16%
increase in all crimes; a 0.30% and 0.37% increase in violent and non-violent robbery, respectively; an essentially negligible 0.08% increase in non-sexual violent crime; a 0.22% increase
in sexual violence; and a 0.14% increase in VAW helpline calls.
Though these effects appear small, they can be better appreciated by calculating the predicted change expected given the dramatic reduction in mobility observed during the pandemic. Considering only significant coefficients, a 50% reduction in mobility (close to the
53% reduction observed), predicts a 10.9% reduction in all crimes. Similarly, violent and
non-violent robberies would decline 19.0% and 22.8%. Serious violent crimes would decrease
5.4%, sexual violence 14.3%, and VAW helpline calls 9.0%.
Lastly, to check the robustness of the results, Figure 4 presents the predicted change for
a 50% reduction in mobility using coefficients from models estimated with different subsets of data (full period, pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19). In general, most coefficients
were reasonably robust to the effects of the pandemic, though uncertainty was greater for
post-COVID-19 estimates.10 The coefficients for all crimes and violent robbery were consistent insofar as the three models predicted statistically significant declines; however, the
post-COVID-19 estimates suggest that the effect of mobility on crime was greater during
the pandemic. In contrast, the mobility coefficients for non-violent robbery were notoriously
robust to the effect of the pandemic, as predicted reductions were remarkably similar for the
three models. The mobility coefficient for robbery against residence was inconsistent in the
three models, reinforcing the conclusion that there is no relationship between the variables.
10

The greater uncertainty is expected given that the post period is much shorter.

21

Similarly, though the full period model had suggested that there was a small positive and
statistically significant relationship between mobility and serious violent crime, the coefficients from the pre- and post-COVID-19 models were not significant, suggesting that the
relationship is unlikely to be significant. The coefficients for sexual violence were consistent
in terms of direction, magnitude and significance. Similarly, the mobility coefficients for
domestic violence were consistent with the result of no significant relationship. Lastly, the
relationship between mobility and VAW helpline calls was consistent for the three models.

Discussion
Overall, the results of the ARIMA forecasts suggest that Mexico City experienced sizeable
and significant reductions in incidence for most crime categories after COVID-19 was detected in the country. Estimates from the crime-mobility models with ARIMA errors suggest
that part of the declines for some crime categories were likely due to reductions in urban
mobility.
An aggregated measure of all crimes saw statistically significant reductions after the pandemic, and the mobility coefficient was significant and positive (suggesting all crimes decreased in line with urban mobility). This suggests that at least part of the reduction observed in all crimes was likely associated to the change in routine activities captured by the
reduction in mobility. However, it is relevant to note the strength of the association between
all crimes and mobility appeared to increase after COVID-19 cases were detected in the
country, which suggests the presence of an interaction between mobility and an unobserved
variable related to the onset of the pandemic.
Similarly, violent and non-violent robberies experienced significant reductions during the
pandemic (though the reduction in non-violent robberies was only significant for the period
after the lockdown), and the mobility coefficient suggested that part of these declines can be
explained by the reductions in public transport mobility. Like for all crimes, the association
between mobility and violent robberies appeared to strengthen after COVID-19 cases were
detected in the country—suggesting the presence of an interaction. In contrast, the relationship between non-violent robberies and mobility was robust, as the association was constant
throughout the periods analyzed.
Though robberies against residences experienced a significant decline during the pandemic,
the mobility coefficient was not significant, which suggests that the decline observed in this

23

crime type is unlikely to be explained by the change in mobility patterns and may instead
be driven by other changes in routine activities associated to the pandemic.
Serious violent crimes experienced non-significant reductions during both post-COVID-19
periods. This was consistent with the mobility coefficient which did not suggest a relationship
between urban mobility and serious violent crime.
I had hypothesized that crimes that disproportionately affect women would increase during
the pandemic as women would be less able to escape their potential abusers (and hence
would have a negative relationship with urban mobility). For sexual violence this expectation was informed by global patterns suggesting that the majority of sexual violence occurs
in homes rather than in public places (Jewkes, Sen, & Garcia-Moreno, 2002, p. 161). Domestic violence, by definition, is expected to occur mostly in homes. However, contrary to
expectations, sexual and domestic violence crimes decreased during the pandemic (though
this was only significant for the post-lockdown period). The results of the crime-mobility
models help clarify these findings.
The mobility coefficient for sexual crimes was significant and positive, suggesting that as
mobility decreased, the incidence of sexual crimes decreased as well. This surprising finding
may be explained by the fact that sexual assault is extremely common in Mexico City’s
public transport: 80% of female users reported being a victim of sexual violence on public
transportation in the past year (Zermeño Núñez & Plácido Rı́os, 2009). Thus, it is quite
likely that the decrease in sexual assaults during the pandemic was a direct result of fewer
women using public transport.
In contrast, the mobility coefficient for domestic violence was not significant, which suggests
that the decline observed for this crime type cannot be explained by the reduction in mobility.

24

On the other hand, while VAW helpline calls increased during the post-COVID-19 and
post-lockdown periods (though not significantly), the mobility coefficient was significant and
positive. This suggests the presence of an omitted variable exerting upward pressure on
VAW helpline calls during the pandemic, as the reduction seen in mobility would have been
expected to drive VAW downwards (given the positive and significant mobility coefficient).
The unexpected positive relationship between mobility and VAW calls may be explained by
two main reasons. First, VAW calls are grouped by the date the call took place, whereas all
other crime incidents are grouped by the date of occurrence. It is quite possible that VAW
calls reporting violent incidents take place some days after the incident occurred, for example,
once the victim is alone. This would explain why days with more mobility also experience
more VAW calls: victims may have more opportunities to call the helpline on days when
victims or their abusers are not home. Second, if most calls are related to sexual rather than
domestic violence, the significant association between mobility and VAW calls may reflect
the widespread prevalence of sexual violence on public transport mentioned earlier. However,
in their aggregated form it is not possible to establish this.
While the reductions estimated using ARIMA forecasts for all crimes, violent and nonviolent robberies, and sexual violence were consistent with the reductions predicted by the
mobility coefficient, the changes predicted by the latter were substantially smaller than those
predicted by the former. For all crimes, the reduction predicted by a 50% drop in mobility
was 74% smaller than that estimated using the ARIMA forecast. For violent and nonviolent robbery, the mobility-predicted reductions were 39% and 27% smaller, respectively,
than those estimated using the ARIMA forecasts. For sexual violence, the mobility-predicted
reduction was 74% smaller. These discrepancies suggest that the changes in routine activities
(as estimated by reductions in public transport mobility) may only be responsible for a
fraction of the reductions observed.

25

One possibility to explain the discrepancies is the presence of an unobserved variable associated with the onset of the pandemic. For example, the willingness (or ability) to report a
crime may have decreased during the pandemic, thus part of the reductions not explained by
changes in mobility may reflect an increase in under-reporting, rather than changes in the
‘true’ incidence of criminal phenomena. This may be exacerbated by the fact that the crime
incidents reported by Mexico City’s government are crime investigations recorded by Mexico
City’s prosecutor’s office, rather than crimes recorded by the police. While the authorities
made important efforts to facilitate crime reporting and kept prosecutor’s offices working
with reduced staff during the lockdown, it is likely that some victims may have avoided
reporting crimes due to fear of contagion or faced other lockdown-associated hurdles.
The corollary to this limitation is that the reductions in crime seen in ARIMA forecasts
supported by reductions predicted by the mobility coefficient are more likely to reflect (albeit
partially) reductions in the true incidence of crime.

Conclusions
This study sought to determine if crime patterns in Mexico City changed due to the COVID19 pandemic, and to test whether any changes observed were associated with the disruption
of routine activities. The first objective was achieved by comparing the observed patterns
for seven crime types, as well as an aggregated all crimes category, with those expected
using ARIMA forecasts. The second objective was achieved by examining the relationship
between the different crime categories and the number of public transport passengers, using
regressions with ARIMA errors.
The analyses were consistent with findings reported in other countries, insofar they suggested
that most crime categories decreased during the pandemic. Decreases were not statistically
significant for serious violent crimes. While sexual violence and domestic violence exhibited
26

significant declines after the lockdown was instituted, calls to a violence against women
helpline did not reveal significant changes during the pandemic.
Furthermore, the study found that most of the declines observed were associated with the
changes in routine activities as measured by the number of passengers using public transport.
However, the declines predicted by the changes in mobility were not as large as—nor always
consistent with—those observed, which suggested that additional processes could have affected crime incidence during the pandemic. In particular, the role of changes in reporting
behaviour was discussed.
The study contributes to the global evaluation of the effects of COVID-19 on crime rates
in two ways. First, it focuses on a different context outside of the countries where criminological research has traditionally been carried out. And second, it proposes a robust
and explicit approach to examine the association between changes in crime with changes in
routine activities in the context of the pandemic.
