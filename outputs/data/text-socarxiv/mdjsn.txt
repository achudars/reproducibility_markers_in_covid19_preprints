"10" "Abstract"
"11" "Objective"
"12" "Educational provision changed during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK (20 th  March to 31 st  May 2020) with schooling moving online. The Prime Minister announced a timetable for partial reopening of school on 10 th  May. With the return to partial schooling imminent, the views of year 10 and year 12 students were surveyed."
"13" "Design"
"14" "Cross-sectional web-based survey  disseminated via closed social media fora."
"15" "Setting"
"16" "A structured questionnaire hosted on Google Forms™ and disseminated via two Facebook™ fora in the week prior to the original stated date of return to partial schooling for year 10 a n d year 12 students (20 th     to  27 th  May  2020)."
"17" "Participants"
"18" "United Kingdom school students in year 10 (age 14 to 15 years old) and year 12 (age 16 to 17 years old)."
"19" "Main outcome measures"
"20" "Views of year 10 and year 12 students on returning to schools with a focus on their opinions on government guidance, impact on their future, and how remote learning has impacted on their education."
"21" "Results"
"22" "1534 students (yr10 n= 1007 66%, yr12 n=527 34%) completed the questionnaire."
"23" "Students were equally divided in opinion with 781 (51%) preferring to return to partial schooling with limited educational contact and 753 (49%) preferring to remain isolated at home with remote schooling, when an unsure option was removed."
"24" "A majority (73%, n=1111) of students feel unsafe or unsure that Government guidelines will be enough to protect them from COVID-19 in a school environment. 79% (n=1205) of students felt that COVID-19 has impacted on their future. 15% (n=231) of students said they have had no additional support or guidance from their school during remote learning."
"25" "Conclusions"
"26" "Year 10 and 12 school students  were  divided equally in their preferences about returning to partial school. Exploration of their uncertainty by thematic analysis revealed the source to be anxieties around safety. Students feel they are being put at risk and  because  guidelines will be impossible to enforce in a school environment. Some students recognised a need to return to education despite  this  perceived risk. An inequity in the standard of education was identified with 15% (n=231) of students reporting that they did not receive any support during the 87 days of lock down.  School students expressed desire that their concerns be heard by the Government. Better consideration needs to be taken of the concerns of these year groups in the future."
"27" "Introduction"
"28" "On May 10 th , 2020 the UK Government announced that Secondary Schools, Sixth Forms and Further Education Colleges could provide some face-to-face support for year 10 and year 12 students after June 1 st  2020, though this was subsequently deferred to start on 15 th  June (1) . Students in these year groups have national exams in Summer 2021."
"29" "Government guidance to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in schools consists of regular cleaning of frequently touched surfaces, minimizing student contact by changing classroom layouts and timetabling staggered breaks (2) ."
"30" "It is not apparent that the Government has engaged with the school students affected most by this decision. Students have not been given a platform to raise their concerns about returning to education. Their voices have not been heard."
"31" "It is important to involve  young  people in decisions that affect their situation so that they engage with the policy (3) . Yr 10 and yr 12 students are of an age where their opinions should be taken into account."
"32" "This study was conducted to explore the opinions of year 10s and 12s concerning returning to partial school after the first wave of the covid-19 outbreak in June 2020. The aim was to provide a voice to young people on returning to partial schooling in June 2020. Students were invited to express their preferences on returning to school; their views about safety with respect to government guidance on return to school and how they feel COVID-19 will impact on their future. This study will inform members of the public and policy makers about the opinions of year 10 and 12 students returning to school in the UK at the end of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak."
"33" "Methods"
"34" "Study design and setting"
"35" "Qualitative research using a prospective survey was conducted during the time period of concern. Participants are year 10 (age 14 to 15 years old) and year 12 (age 16 to 17 years old) school students in the United Kingdom."
"36" "Data Collection"
"37" "A  12-question  survey was compiled on Google Forms™ with 9 close-ended questions and 3 open-ended questions. The survey was distributed to the students via two online Facebook™ forums specific to their year groups:  The A  level Forum (6,500 members) and a GCSE forum (36,000 members). The survey was accessible on multiple platforms (computers and smartphones) and multiple web browsers."
"38" "The survey layout can be found in appendix A."
"39" "Sample Size"
"40" "The intended convenience sample size was 200  participants but  adjusted to 1534 due to the rapid uptake of the questionnaire by students.  The survey was available for 7 days."
"41" "Outcomes"
"42" "Outcomes included: school year of students; student preference to return to school; explanation of previous choice (open question); student expression of reassurance by government guidelines; explanation of previous choice (open question); student expression of how well their school has supported them whilst in lockdown; student expression on methods schools have used to support students remotely; student expression of how effective remote learning is and whether it is a good substitute for face to face lessons; student expression of desire to spend face to face contact time socialising or being delivered curriculum; students view on whether the pandemic has affected their future; explanation of previous choice (open question); students preference to return to school or remain isolated."
"43" "Statistical analyses"
"44" "Open questions were subject to  themed analysis using  Braun and Clark Framework to identify recurring themes in the data, otherwise analysis was limited to summary descriptive statistics."
"45" "Braun and Clark’s framework is a qualitative linear six-phased method of analysis."
"46" "Familiarisation. The responses to the three open-ended questions were read, and general ideas of the data were noted."
"47" "Generating initial codes. NVIVO software (v12) was used to manually produce initial codes from the patterns recorded in the familiarising phase. The codes created were data driven. A systematic approach was used to ensure rigour."
"48" "Searching for themes: Codes were organised into groups. During this stage discussions with my supervisor in making sense of the significance of individual themes took place."
"49" "Reviewing themes: NVIVO nodes were reviewed and discussed with my supervisor to reflect that the themes were purely data driven, and not influenced by opinion."
"50" "Defining and naming themes. The ‘story’ of each theme in relation to the research measures were identified. This provided clarity to what the themes were."
"51" "Producing the report. The final opportunity to analyse data."
"52" "Patient and public involvement"
"53" "This is action  research;  the author is a year 12 student.  A pilot run of the study was shared with a peer group of 10 students  in the same school as the author. Unanimously positive feedback was received, and no changes were made to the survey. The survey sought the views of year 10 and year 12 students throughout the UK."
"54" "Results"
"55" "1007 year 10 and 527 year 12 students participated in the study (figure 1). There was a rapid positive response from the group forums with many students commenting that they were glad to voice their views and to get their “strong opinions” across. More year 10s responded to the study probably because the GCSE forum had approximately six times more members than the A level forum"
"56" "Figure 1. School student participants by year group."
"57" "Attitudes towards returning to school"
"58" "When students were asked if they wanted to return to school, more students 41% (633/1534) preferred not to return, 36% (544/1534) did want to return and 23% (357/1534) were unsure (figure 2)."
"59" "Figure 2. School students ’  preference s  on returning to school"
"60" "Students were offered the opportunity to expand on the reasons why they chose to answer the previous question. There were 577 qualitative responses recorded including anomalies and discarded results. Themed analysis identified the reasons behind the answers given (figure 3 and 4)."
"61" "101 students said they would not feel safe to return to school. 61 students said the risk of infection would be too high. Respondent 11 said “ It isn’t yet safe. It puts teachers at risk and risks the R number to rise again.”  An additional 15 people said public transport will risk too much exposure to COVID-19."
"62" "Figure 3. Ranked frequency distribution of reasons not to return to school."
"63" "Respondent 36 said “ The bus is always busy and overcrowded even if people  were  wearing masks, I don’t not think it would be safe”.  23 students said guidelines would be impossible to adhere to in a school environment. 16 students said they would prefer to protect themselves and their families, with an additional 11 students shielding for themselves and 38 opting to shield for vulnerable relatives. 6 students said it would be unfair to return to a school environment before being able to see family members at a distance. 17 respondents expressed anxieties around returning to school after the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. An additional three students described that they felt like “guinea pigs”."
"64" "34 students said there was no need to return. For example, respondent 106 said “ I have finished most of this year’s work and I am managing to do the rest online so see no need to go back to school”. Respondent 122 commented that “ With schools only offering a few hours (at most) each week, it seems pointless to return when additional support and guidance could be provided online.”  An additional 11 students said the time put into facilitating the guidelines would outweigh the benefit of face to face teaching and 8 said the hostile environment would be difficult to learn in."
"65" "21 students said their decision to return would depend on the guidelines and whether they were carried out sufficiently. An overarching theme was that students would be happy to return if their safety could be guaranteed."
"66" "117 respondents said face to face teaching is a necessity, with an extra 36 students wanting to return due to fear of failing exams. Respondent 237 said, “I want to go back because I’m  failing,  and I need to talk to my teachers and get back on track before next year”."
"67" "Students addressed that returning to school would provide routine, where home learning does not. 27 want to return to some sense of normality. An extract from respondent 147 said “ I would like to return so I can regain some normality, see my friends and have some proper learning time”."
"68" "Figure 4. Ranked frequency distribution showing the reasons why students want to return to school."
"69" "20 students said online learning is not effective and 9 students said their home is not a learning environment. 11 mentioned the impact that working from home has had on their motivation to study. For  example,  respondent 210 said, “I’m finding it a lot more difficult to learn with online teaching and harder to self-motivate.” 27 students want to return to socialise and improve their mental health."
"70" "V iews on whether Government Guidelines were sufficient to reassure students that returning to partial schooling will be safe."
"71" "When asked 53% (811/1534) of students did not feel reassured that the guidelines the Government has advised schools on returning to school would be safe . 28%(423/1534) of students felt assured that Government guidelines would protect them in the school environment. 20%(300/1534) of students were unsure the guidelines would be enough (figure 5)."
"72" "Figure 5. School students' decision on whether Government Guidance for schools reassures them that their school will be a safe environment."
"73" "Students were given the option to expand on their previous answer. 903 qualitative responses were recorded including anomalies and discarded results. Themed analysis shows the reasoning behind their choice. (Figure 6, figure 7)"
"74" "Figure 6. Ranked frequency distribution showing the reasons students are reassured by the guidance."
"75" "Guidelines are perceived as adequate by 92 respondents. Of these 29 would be happy to return if social distancing is applied and 6 want rules to be enforced. 48 believe the guidelines will be sufficient. 8 specified they would be happy to return if classes are small whilst 7 said regular hand washing/cleaning must be enforced. 5 said they trusted the government and scientific advice. Respondent 419 stated “These are perfectly acceptable measures to ensure safety. As long as I am able to learn I don’t mind.”"
"76" "Some mentioned students are a low risk group with 25 stating age is low risk and 7 stating students are mature enough to apply the measures themselves. For example, respondent 151 said “ I think a lot of it is down to personal responsibility. You yourself should know to not be in close contact with people, wash your hands etc”.  21 addressed a need for education which outweighs safety and 21 said there is no alternative.  Respondent 323 said, “There’s not much else that can be done, and I think these steps will  ensure everyone remains as safe as possible.”"
"77" "Figure 7. Ranked frequency distribution showing reasons students do not feel reassured by guidance."
"78" "Schools have poor facilities and “ schools aren’t designed for social distancing” to quote respondent 170.   This means student safety cannot be guaranteed if schools partially reopen. 242 students said facilities are too cramped to allow social distancing. 63 said facilities had poor hygiene, mentioning issues with toilets and access to soap. For example respondent 874 said “ I don’t think my school has the money or the facilities, all the bathrooms are unhygienic and are usually locked because of breakages”.  24 students said transport to school is overcrowded and cramped meaning guidelines would be impossible to adhere to. 11 said they would want the wearing of personal protective equipment to be part of the compulsory guidelines. 5 addressed the issue of schools not having the resources and funding to implement the guidelines adequately."
"79" "149 students said the enforcement of such guidelines in a school environment would be impossible. Teachers will not be able to discipline students who break the guidelines. Respondent 155 mentioned  “We have immature students who would mess about with the rules”  and respondent 423 said “teenagers are not sticking to lockdown rules outside of school so why would they do it in school?” .  23 said it will be impossible not to socialise and not habitually interact via hugging or sharing phones. Respondent 528 commented “I t's going to be hard to not hug a friend”."
"80" "Students said the virus has too many unknowns. For example, 65 students said the death rate from COVID-19 is still higher than when schools closed and therefore said it is too early to open schools. Additionally, 54 said the virus will spread in a school environment. Respondent 191 said, “ The virus is not just spread through touching infected surfaces. It is spread through droplets in the air so I fear that I can still catch it despite all the rules and measures taken”.  23 students said the virus is asymptomatic for 5 days so it will be impossible to prevent infectious students entering the school environment."
"81" "Some students feel safer at home, with 31 students wanting to shield for vulnerable relatives and 9 opting to protect their families. 6 addressed concerns that attending schools will enable mixing of many households."
"82" "10 students shared they had mental health issues, worrying about considering returning to a potentially infectious area. An additional 13 students said this new school environment will be unpleasant."
"83" "Do you think this pandemic has impacted your future?"
"84" "When asked, the majority of students (78%, 1205/1534 ) felt COVID-19 has impacted on their future. This is the most united response of all 12 questions. 11% (165/1534) of students did not feel COVID-19 has impacted at all, with 11% (164/1534) students being uncertain."
"85" "Figure 8. School students view on the impact of COVID-19 on their future."
"86" "Students were given the option to expand on their previous answer. 417 qualitative responses were recorded including anomalies and discarded results. Thematic analysis revealed key reasons behind each answer (figure 9 and 10)."
"87" "The main concern from students was the impact remote learning will have on grades with 125 stating this. Respondent 151 said, “My grades may be lower because the quality of learning isn’t as high, and we’ve missed a lot of school time”. Additionally, 117 specified that they were struggling to learn the course including 34 requesting special consideration to accommodate for this. 24 respondents were concerned they had lost lesson time or would now have less time to learn the course next year."
"88" "The second main theme addressed is that opportunities have been limited or cancelled. 65 respondents said work experience has been cancelled. 57 said careers fairs, open days and extracurricular activities have been cancelled. This has left them feeling unsupported and unprepared for the future. Respondent 213 said, “We can’t go to open days or complete work experience so our insight to make considered choices about our future has been impacted”."
"89" "Figure 9. Ranked frequency distribution showing ways COVID-19 has impacted on students' futures."
"90" "This links to 69 students who feel COVID-19 has directly impacted on University, College and Apprenticeship applications. Respondent 269 said “I have had no support for university applications, no help in writing a personal statement and no information on what grades will be used to apply for universities”. An additional 7 students have changed career choices due to closure of apprenticeships and uncertainty in their previously chosen career path. 12 students commented on how COVID-19 has impacted on their mental health, making them feel stressed about the future."
"91" "Figure 10. Ranked frequency distribution showing the reasons students do not feel COVID-19 has impacted their futures."
"92" "17 respondents said remote learning is fine, with an additional 5 saying it has motivated them to work harder. Respondent 1035 said “Personally, if I keep on top  of  all my work, I’m learning the same amount as I would in lessons. Plus, it gives me time to do extra revision.”"
"93" "8 people said everyone is in the same position. 2 students said it has had a limited impact with 6 saying opportunities are the same however manifest differently now."
"94" "5 people said only time can tell the impact of COVID-19 on their future. “I think it’s too early to tell if it’s had a lasting effect.”"
"95" "Perceived impact of remote online learning on education"
"96" "Students were asked “How well do you think your school/college has supported delivery of the curriculum to you during lockdown?” (figure 11)."
"97" "Figure 11. Distribution of responses on a five point scale to “How well do you think your school/college has supported delivery of the curriculum to you during lockdown?” where 1 = No support in place through to 5= the course has continued to be covered to a very high standard."
"98" "37% (573) students held no strong views or were uncertain on whether schools had supported delivery of the curriculum. This data is skewed to the right suggesting the majority of students believe they have received a good standard of support and continued their education remotely. However 21.4% (328/1534) of students chose level 1 or 2 showing they have had no support or limited support with remote learning."
"99" "Students were given options to express how remote learning was supported (figure 12)."
"100" "Figure 12. Frequency distribution of modes of support for remote learning"
"101" "The main method of support has been setting work via an online classroom system against a deadline. Some 34% of students have received frequent virtual lessons, but 15% (231) of students state they have received no additional support or guidance."
"102" "Students were asked “How effective do you think remote learning is? Or put another way do you feel remote learning is a good enough substitute for contact time in lessons?”. They were asked to score supported delivery using a 5 point scale with  1 =  it does not suit you at all to 5= remote learning is just as effective as usual lessons (figure 13)."
"103" "Figure 13. Distribution of responses to “How effective do you think remote learning is?” on a five point scale where 1 =  it does not suit you at all to 5= Remote learning is just as effective as usual lessons."
"104" "The data is skewed to the left showing students feel remote learning cannot be a long term substitute  for face to face education. Only 20.2% (310/1534) of students feel remote learning is an adequate substitute (grouped responders scoring 4 or 5)."
"105" "Figure 14. Bar chart distribution of how students would prefer to spend partial school contact hours."
"106" "This question identifies what students want from face to face learning. 64.8% (812/1534) of students want to have some time or spend all contact time socialising with friends."
"107" "23.3% (357/1534) of students want school contact time to be kept solely for learning. 23.8% (365/1534) of students do not know how they want to spend school contact time."
"108" "Do students in Year 10 and Year 12 want to return to partial schooling on June 15th?"
"109" "Students were asked “Do you want to return to partial schooling on June 15th as proposed by the government or maintain isolation and continue with remote schooling at home (figure 15)?"
"110" "Figure 15. Proportion of students who would prefer to return to remote learning or maintain isolation."
"111" "51% (781/1534) of students  preferred  to return to some partial schooling as proposed by the Government. 49% (753/1534) of students prefer to remain isolated at home and continue remote learning. This question forced students who previously were uncertain on their view of returning to schools to choose. Interestingly the initial 23% (357/1534) of uncertain students divided evenly, meaning the equal split in opinion remained."
"112" "Discussion"
"113" "Principal findings"
"114" "78.6% (1205/1534) of students said that COVID-19 has impacted on their future. Students shared that they fear failing their exams or that they are struggling to learn content remotely. Others commented on limited opportunities and concerns with further education applications. This suggests many students are concerned about the impact of COVID-19 and future measures should be put in place to support them. This may consist of extra support groups for recapping content taught during lockdown and special consideration for students during this period."
"115" "Whilst most students felt their school provided a good standard of support during in COVID-19 pandemic, 15% (231/1534) of students selected that they have received no support from their school during lockdown. A further 24.2% (371/1534) of students gave the lowest level rating 1 saying that remote learning did not suit them at all. This is an outstanding proportion of the  population and  suggests COVID-19 is causing an educational divide. In question 11 (comment on the impact of COVID-19 on your future), 34 mentioned that special consideration should be given to those sitting examinations in Summer 2021."
"116" "Alternatively,  this divide may indicate the importance of returning to school soon to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on students’ education and close any educational divide due to lockdown.  However,   eight  students said having some schools returning in June disadvantages those students whose schools are not returning to partial schooling (answers to question 3). Perhaps returning to school may cause a further educational divide and instead all students should be treated the same, with the same educational opportunities. If remote learning is to continue instead the Government should construct standardised requirements for schools to follow. This baseline will standardise the level of education students receive in the lead up to examinations. These remote learning guidelines should be added to plans for future preparedness for other pandemics. This may bridge this educational divide."
"117" "There was an even split in opinion on whether students wanted to return to schools after the peak of COVID-19. This strong divide in the student community reflects that there is an uncertainty between students in the year 10 and year 12. This shows more needs to be done to address student concerns and inform them on Government actions. The Government needs to engage with young people and get them on board with guidance. 72.5% (1111/1534) of students do not trust or feel uncertain that the guidelines set by the UK Government will be enough to protect them from COVID-19 in a school environment. This is a very large proportion of the school population. Young people’s concerns should be listened to and acted  upon, so   young people can have more input on the measures, can improve the guidance and consequently trust in it more."
"118" "64.8% (812/1534) students want to spend at least some time at school socialising. Conceding to this and making socialising a part of contact time at school will allow students to catch up in a controlled environment. It will remove incentive to meet up outside of school and potentially break Government Guidelines. This may reduce the spread of COVID-19 and stop socialising being tabooed."
"119" "Strengths and limitations of project"
"120" "1500 responses were recorded within the first 80 hours of the survey opening. This rapid and high response shows young people are eager to voice their opinions and be heard. Students commented that they thought this survey was important as they have had no say in Government decisions concerning students, and this provided an opportunity for their opinions to be shared. The high uptake demonstrates students have valid contributions to make."
"121" "More year 10 students (66% responded than year 12s (34%). We did not examine differences in opinion between year groups."
"122" "The study depended on social media and access to information technology. It is possible that some students do not have access to computers or smartphones, which may introduce bias in the respondents’ socioeconomic status , however research by Office of National Statistics in 2018 states that only 1% of  16year old do not have regular access to the internet (4) ."
"123" "Conclusions and policy implications"
"124" "Year 10 and 12 school students are evenly divided in opinion about whether they should return to school on 15th June. This uncertainty appears based on the majority of students having concerns about schools' ability to comply with government guidance, particularly around social distancing and the risk of transmission. This uncertainty could be addressed by better engagement from policy makers with school students. They should address students’ concerns and better explain the reasoning behind returning certain students to school at this time whilst other members of the community continue to isolate."
"125" "Policy makers should standardise remote learning. This will ensure all students receive some educational support during pandemics, ensuring the educational divide caused by a lockdown is minimized."
