Abstract
COVID-19 pandemic is affecting mental health and wellbeing across populations. The continued
burden of psychosocial stressors in different contexts necessitates multipronged interventions that
address mental health problems and associated disparities. Global evidence suggests that social
capital plays a critical role in determining mental health outcomes in communities, which can be
leveraged for improving mental health in COVID-19. As communities with better social capital is
likely to have a lower burden of mental disorders, it is necessary to assess potential measures to
use social capital for mental health promotion in vulnerable populations. The existing forms of
social capital may provide social support within and between communities that are critically
affected by COVID-19. Alongside faster recovery from socioeconomic challenges, social capital
interventions may strengthen the social determinants of mental health and empower communities
to alleviate the psychosocial consequences of this pandemic.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has critically impacted mental health and
wellbeing globally (Hossain et al., 2020b; Rajkumar, 2020). Since the beginning of this pandemic,
unpredictability and uncertainty regarding infection prevention, clinical care, and health outcomes
have affected psychosocial health across populations. Moreover, preventive strategies like
lockdown and physical distancing might have led to social isolation, unemployment, loneliness,
and inadequate access to essential commodities, which have impacted psychosocial wellbeing
(Hossain et al., 2020b). The mental health impacts of this pandemic are more severe among
individuals with existing mental health problems or those who were already exposed to
psychological risk factors. As most health systems are poorly equipped with mental health services
and resources, there is a growing concern on strengthening mental health through socio-ecological
approaches that may alleviate the increasing burden of mental health problems in this pandemic
(Hossain et al., 2020a; Rajkumar, 2020; Sentell et al., 2020). Global evidence supports that social
capital plays a critical role during public health crises as well as contributes to better mental health
in communities and populations. In this article, we briefly discuss social capital and mental health
in the context of COVID-19 that may inform psychosocial policymaking and practice in this
pandemic.

Social capital and mental health: an overview of the evidence
Social capital is a well-researched concept that emphasizes social and cognitive constructs like
social cohesion, trust, norms, and networks (Ferlander, 2007). Two major forms of social capital,
namely bonding capital (social ties within a community) and bridging capital (social ties between
communities), may provide critical support that is essential for improving and sustaining social
determinants of health (Chen and Meng, 2015; Ferlander, 2007). The fundamental constructs of
social capital work together in communities and contribute to collective efficacy leading to better
health and wellbeing among individuals. Previous research has explored how social capital is
associated with mental health in different contexts. A systematic review of 55 studies found that
family and community social capital were associated with behavioral and mental health in children
and adolescents (McPherson et al., 2014). Another review of 39 studies reported that individual
social capital had protective roles against developing common mental disorders (Ehsan and De
2

Silva, 2015). A similar review by De Silva and colleagues evaluated 21 studies and reported that
individual and ecological social capital might have an inverse relationship with mental health
problems across populations (De Silva et al., 2005). The role of social capital is also examined in
vulnerable populations who may have poor psychosocial health and associated risk factors. For
example, Nyqvist and colleagues systematically assessed 11 studies that reported positive
associations between social capital and mental health in older adults (Nyqvist et al., 2013). While
most of the research syntheses highlighted the roles of social capital in improving mental health,
Noel and colleagues reviewed 15 studies that evaluated the association between social capital and
mental health in public health crises like disasters and conflicts (Noel et al., 2018). This review
suggested that cognitive social capital had an inverse association with mental health problems,
including post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression. The available evidence informs
the potentials of social capital for ensuring optimal mental health and wellbeing in normal
conditions as well as in crises, which should be examined in the context of the COVID-19
pandemic.

Social capital and COVID-19: implications for mental health
COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the closure of public places, whereas lockdown and stay-athome orders have decreased social gatherings and connectedness. These factors may affect social
capital as well as mental health among the affected individuals. Nonetheless, the worsening
economic indices with no foreseeable end, individual and collective helplessness, negative
emotions, and other psychosocial challenges are thriving around the world (Aluh and Onu, 2020).
In this scenario, the relationship social capital can be affected in three major ways. First, existing
means of social support originating from bonding social capital may not be leveraged effectively
during this pandemic, which may affect psychosocial wellbeing in individuals. Second, as most
communities remain isolated and disconnected, leveraging bridging social capital remains equally
challenging in this scenario, which may further affect the social determinants of mental health.
Lastly, institutional efforts for facilitating social capital remain suboptimal as most health systems,
clinical and social care providers continue to struggle for preventing the spread of COVID-19 and
providing clinical care to infected individuals. Therefore, the use of existing social capital or
deployment of social capital interventions from external sources can be inadequate in this
3

pandemic, which may impact mental health and wellbeing at individual, community, and
population levels.
A growing body of literature indicates that social capital is critical for the psychosocial wellbeing
in COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study of 170 self-isolated individuals in China has
reported that a low level of social capital was associated with elevated risks of anxiety and stress.
Moreover, a higher level of social capital was positively associated with the quality of sleep in
those participants (Xiao et al., 2020). Moreover, in the United States, a higher social capital was
found to be positively correlated with decreased mobility (Borgonovi and Andrieu, 2020),
highlighting the reduction of community transmission, better self-sustenance, improved health
outcomes, and associated psychosocial impacts. Similar studies suggest that social capital is
negatively associated with COVID-19 growth rates and retail/recreational movements, and
positively associated with residential movement (Varshney and Socher, 2020). This indicates that
communities with high social capital may respond more efficaciously than those with low social
capital (Pitas and Ehmer, 2020). Such responses may range from providing social support at the
individual level to ensuring optimal social determinants of mental health in communities, which
may subsequently result in a lower risk of mental health problems and improved mental wellbeing
across populations.

Setting global health priorities for enhancing social capital and mental health
It is essential to adopt several strategies ensuring evidence-based practices to leverage social
capital for improving mental health during COVID-19. First, the existing social capital and the
burden of psychosocial problems in a community should be analyzed, which can be very much
different across communities depending on psychosocial dynamics and how those are impacted by
this pandemic. Such analyses would inform the community stakeholders, including mental health
providers and social workers, to assess how social capital is organized in that community and what
approaches may deploy them in promoting mental health and wellbeing. Secondly, mapping social
and mental health resources may facilitate engaging those resources in crisis management and
linking social capital and mental health in a community. Thirdly, social capital measures often
target the social determinants of health through addressing unemployment, promoting education,
and other means of empowering individuals and communities. As macroeconomic changes during
4

COVID-19 are likely to affect individuals and communities, predominantly the marginalized ones,
it is imperative to identify those vulnerable populations and prioritize such interventions for them.
Fourth, psychosocially vulnerable individuals (for example, homeless people or those who have
preexisting mental health problems) may have a higher need for psychosocial care, who might
need integrated social capital interventions alongside specific care for mental health problems.
Fifth, the use of digital media like the internet and social media is likely to influence the formation
and utilization of social capital among individuals. As little research has been conducted on how
social capital works within the digital ecosystem, a better understanding is needed to make
informed use of such platforms aiming for psychosocial wellbeing. More research is needed in this
domain to address the knowledge gap and use the same for improving mental health outcomes.
Sixth, individuals may be exposed to misinformation and disinformation in social media that may
affect mental health. It would be helpful if social networks are supported with such information
that may reestablish trust among individuals and foster psychosocial solidarity (Tasnim et al.,
2020). Lastly, systems-level measures like policies, programs, and proactive leadership would be
needed to engage institutions and communities for effective development of social capital as well
as mental health resilience in this pandemic.

Conclusion and way forward
Social capital can play critical roles in preventing mental health problems and promoting positive
mental health across populations. With the growing psychosocial problems associated with
COVID-19, communities and institutions are experiencing remarkable challenges to mitigate the
consequences of this pandemic. In this scenario, the healthcare providers and policymakers may
need to devise sustainable and evidence-based strategies minimizing the psychosocial impacts of
this pandemic and promoting resilience across communities. Social capital research and practice
may inform how public mental health can be strengthened using community resources. The
ongoing approaches must incorporate strategic measures such as social capital interventions and
evaluate how they work in different contexts, which may strengthen global psychosocial responses
to the COVID-19 pandemic and future public health emergencies.
