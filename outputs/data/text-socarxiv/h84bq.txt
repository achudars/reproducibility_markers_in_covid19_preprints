Abstract
The world history has been witnessed of number of pandemics including
Russian flu in 1889, Spanish flu in 1918, Asian flu in 1957, HIV/AIDS
(human immunodeficiency virus, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) in
1981, and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2003. Now, the
human community is struggling against transmitting disease called COVID19 (coronavirus disease). Many countries, including China, Italy, the United
States of America, Spain, France and Iran, etc. experienced catastrophic
COVID-19 attack and lost the lives of their many citizens. India, the world's
second-largest population, has not yet experienced the outbreak of corona
disease on a community level, but India is most likely to be affected. This
paper presents a countryside discussion on the process and importance of a
quick response of India as a remedy against COVID-19. This paper is based
on secondary data from various resources of world health organization
(WHO), the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India and
other research documents. The analysis demonstrates the decline in the
percent of COVID-19 infected people after proper social distancing
implementation among the human community.

Introduction
Almost every year, the world suffers from an influenza outbreak in several
forms, although its severity varies widely with the circumstances. In the last
120 years, the world underwent many pandemics- the 1889 Russian flu, the
1918 Spanish flu, the 1957 Asian flu, the 1981 HIV/AIDS (human
immunodeficiency virus, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), and the

2003 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). Each of the outbreaks has
different ramifications in terms of the severity and spread of the disease as
well as responsible pathogens among the community (Kilbourne, 2006).
Among all, the 1918 Spanish flu has been the most pervasive and acute, which
was caused by the H1N1 virus. The outbreak accounted for approximately 40
million deaths and affected one-third of the world's total population.
The SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for the
current outbreak coronavirus disease (COVID-19), was first reported in
November 2019 in Wuhan, China (Lai et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) and
rapidly outspread in different parts of the world within a short span. The world
health organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a
pandemic on 12th March 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020a). The WHO
has delineated the symptoms of COVID-19 as fever, dry cough, tiredness,
nasal congestion, pneumonia, and sore throat (Chen et al., 2020; Wang et al.,
2020; Yang et al. 2020). As of June 30, 2020, there have been 10,185,374
confirmed cases including 503,862 number of deaths (World Health
Organization, 2020b). The United States of America (USA) is the most
affected country in the world, with 2,537,636 number of total reported cases,
including 126,203 deaths. The conditions are getting worse day by day as a
4% to 5% increment can be recorded in daily new cases since March 16, 2020
(Government of New York City, 2020).
The country, like China, with 1.3927 billion of the population, has fought
actively against COVID-19 and succeeded in the containment of the disease
within geographically defined locales. Earlier, a few studies have predicted
that 40% of China’s population (500 million people) would be infected if no
containment efforts will be taken. However, the combined measures of early
detection, isolation, and intercity travel bans helped to a drop in people to
people contact and resulted in a reduction in transmission of disease.
Together, these efforts succeeded in preventing the increment of cases by 67
fold (Lai et al., 2020). The other countries took a lesson from China and
ordered a nationwide lockdown to encourage social distancing between
people. The most prominent example is India, with 1.3526 billion population
announced the 21 days nationwide lockdown on March 25, 2020, and
extended further till May 3, 2020. The WHO has already mentioned their
concerns regarding the spread of COVID-19 in highly dense populated India
(450 people per km2). On the contrary, India’s early call for nationwide
lockdown kept away from stare of the peak cases. A study by the Indian
Council of Medical Research (ICMR) showed that if India had not

implemented the lockdown on time, by April 15, 2020, there would have been
820,000 cases in India (Koshy, 2020). This study focuses on the relevance of
initiatives taken by the Government of India against COVID-19. Moreover, it
aims to explore and to understand the relevance of social distancing as a
remedy to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In particular, this study conducts
the analysis of the consequences generated by the pandemic in India.

Research Methodology
The methodology used in this study is the content analysis, which equipped
the researcher to offer scientific evidence currently. The investigation is
presented by utilizing the secondary data retrieved from various reports
published by WHO, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and the
Government of India. The study was conducted between March 03, 2020, and
June 30, 2020. In this vein, the study examines India's challenges and
responses during a pandemic by exploiting the secondary data. Furthermore,
the study has used Google Trends to assess the disease's influence on society.
Google Trends can be used as an efficient tool for documentation and
scientific review. In the current situation, the whole world is engaged in a
single direction to research, management treatment to control pandemic
COVID-19, and vast amounts of data being collected and archived by
international, national, and regional bodies available in the public domain.
Therefore, the practicality of utilizing existing data for research is becoming
more prevalent (Andrews et al., 2012). Hence, the reports from leading
organizations during a pandemic and other related documents have
incorporated in this study. The data analysis enables the researcher to argue
on certain aspects of India's measures during the pandemic of COVID-19.
Mitigation Strategies
In India, a female student at Wuhan University, China, was confirmed as the
first case of COVID-19 on January 30, 2020 in the southern state of Kerala
after returning to India. As of June 30 2020, a total of 566,840 cases have been
confirmed with 16,893 deaths (Government of India. Ministry of Health and
Family Welfare, 2020). India tested approximately 10,473,771 samples,
which is lowest in the world for a highly populous nation, and epidemiologists
suggest increasing the testing as the number of infected cases could be higher
(“Coronavirus: India defiant,” 2020). However, India manages to keep the
average positivity rate at 8.29, which is significantly lower than other severely
infected countries (Sinha, 2020). The Government of India requested a 14hour voluntary public curfew on March 22, 2020, which was followed by

lockdowns in 75 districts, including major cities where infections were
reported. Furthermore, the Government of India announced a 21 days
complete nationwide lockdown on March 24, 2020, affecting the 1.3526
billion population and extended the complete lockdown further till May 3,
2020. The WHO praised the efforts taken by India and said that with this
“tremendous capacity”, India can fight actively against this pandemic (“India
has tremendous,” 2020). India has scored with a “100” for its stringent action
against COVID-19 by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker
(OxCGRT) report, which was prepared based on the data collected from 73
nations (“India beats other,” 2020; “India scores high,” 2020). This report
appreciated the quick response of the government taken in the fields of
emergency policy making and emergency investment in healthcare. On the
contrary, some economists expressed their concerns about the economic
catastrophe caused by the lockdown, which has impacted a large number of
people involved in micro and small enterprises as informal workers as well as
farmers due to unavailability of transportation and no access to markets
(Kishore, 2020; Ray, 2020). The situation in India is different from other
countries. 27.3% of the Indian population is lying below the poverty line. The
survival of 33% of the total population depends on daily wages.
After 3 cases reported in February 2020, no significant rise in cases was
observed in India till the end of February. On March 4, 2020, 22 new cases
were reported, out of which 14 infected members were Italians. The rapid
escalation in the cases was reported throughout the March. Most of the cases
were people with a travel history to affected countries or people having
contact with infected people. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
analyzed the data of age-wise corona patients and showed that 42% of patients
belong to the age group of 21-40 while the ages between 41 to 50 compromise
with 33% of total infected cases. However, only 17% cases were reported
from the age group (60+) at high risk, while the rest 9% cases have been found
in the ages below 20 years. The graphical representation of age-wise
distribution of cases is shown in Figure 1. It can be noted that 83% of total
cases are under the age of 50 years. The reason for the high percentage under
the age of 50 is that a high number of Indians from this age group are working
or studying in the other parts of the world, including the USA, Italy, France,
UK, and China, etc. They returned to India after an escalation of infection in
those countries. The Government of India shared the data received from the
Bureau Of Immigration and revealed that more than 1.5 million international

air travelers entered into India between January 18, 2020, to March 23, 2020
(“15 lakh air,” 2020).
India’s efforts to combat COVID-19 has many dimensions. However, the
situation in India is different from other countries. 27.3% of the Indian
population is lying below the poverty line. The survival of 33% of the total
population depends on daily wages. Despite all these issues, India took many
measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, which are discussed following.
Lockdown
On March 22, 2020 the Government of India requested all citizens to
cooperate in volunteer “Janta curfew” and also decided to lockdown in 82
districts of 22 states and union territories where COVID-19 cases were
confirmed. On March 24, 2020 the Government of India announced a
complete nationwide lockdown, starting from midnight for 21 days
(“Narendra Modi announces,” 2020). As a result, India had succeeded in
slowing the growth rate of the pandemic of doubling the case in every 3 days
to doubling the case in 6 days (Ramesh, 2020). On April 14, 2020 the
Government of India reviewed the situation and decided to extend the
nationwide lockdown till May 3, 2020, with conditional guidelines to relax
the lockdown for the areas that would be able to contain the spread from April
20, 2020. The Government of India has directed its citizens not to leave the
house without doing the necessary work, and if it is very necessary to get out,
then make a distance of at least 1 meter from other persons. In addition,
citizens should avoid public meetings where there is a high risk of the
infection spreading. We should not personally meet our immediate relatives
and take their skills through technology. Today, there are many technical
mediums such as mobile, WhatsApp, and Facebook, through which we can
connect with everyone even by staying in our homes.

Welfare, 2020).
Travel and entry restrictions
India has stopped issuing new visas from March 3. Also, the Government
of India suspended previously issued visas to the nationals of Italy, Iran, South
Korea, and Japan. All types of new visas were suspended from March 13,
2020 to stop the traffic from infected countries. On March 20, 2020 India
banned international flights to curb the corona outbreaks. To prevent the
intercity movement of people, the Government of India suspended the Indian
railway's services and domestic flight services from March 24, 2020.
Aarogya Setu
India launched an android based mobile application called Aarogya Setu
to help in "contact tracing and containing the spread" of COVID-19 pandemic
in the nation, which was developed by the Ministry of Electronics and
Information Technology. The World Bank already asked countries to deploy
the technologies to combat the pandemic. Google and Apple companies
announced on April 11, 2020 to develop similar software for mobile phones
as the Aarogya Setu application, which would help in tracing people's contact
with infected people.
Testing
Initially, India allowed testing of those people who visited 12 high-risk
countries or those who have come into contact with infected people or those
who have pneumonia symptoms as per government guidelines. After a sudden
increase in cases on March 20, 2020, the government ordered the testing of all
pneumonia cases regardless of their travel history or contact history with
infected people. These tests are provided free of cost by the government to all
corona patients. In March start, only 51 government laboratories were
authorized for corona testing. The number of government laboratories was
extended up to 121 government laboratories by March 27, 2020. Later on, 35
private laboratories have been approved by ICMR for conducting corona
testing with a testing capacity of 12,000 tests per day. At present, about 1000

testing laboratories are functioning with a testing capacity of 250,000 teste per
day. Moreover, the cost of sample testing by private labs was capped by the
government at ₹4,500 (US$ 58.78). Additionally, the Institute of Genomics
and Integrative Biology, Delhi, had succeeded in developing a rapid paperstrip test kit in which each test would cost around ₹500 (US$ 6.53). In spite
of all, there are concerns that corona testing in India is being inadequately
conducted and the need for ramping up the scale of testing is a necessity to
understand the real scope of the number of people affected.
Treatment
Rajasthan state became first state in India to treat 3 corona patients with
the combination of anti-malaria, anti-Swine flu and anti-HIV drugs. On March
23, the National Task Force for COVID-19 constituted by ICMR approved
the use of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of high-risk corona patients.
Furthermore, India banned the export of hydroxychloroquine on March 24 to
keep the buffer in case of a rise in the number of corona patients. India is the
largest producer of hydroxychloroquine and captures 70% of the world's
supply chain, according to the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance. Many
countries like the USA, Spain, Germany, Bahrain, and Brazil, etc. requested
India to release the hydroxychloroquine tablets in this pandemic situation. On
April 11, India lifted the partial ban from the export of hydroxychloroquine
and approved to supply the hydroxychloroquine to 13 countries. Besides, the
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare informed the nation that India had
sufficient stock of 32.8 million hydroxychloroquine tablets, while India will
require only 10 million hydroxychloroquine tablets in the coming weeks
(Saha, 2020).
Ration
In India, approximately 139 million migrant workers work away from their
home town in other parts of the country. Corona pandemic left tens of millions
of migrant workers unemployed. On March 25, 2020, the Government of India
had announced that the government would provide wheat at the rate of ₹2
(US$ 0.026) per kg and rice at ₹3 (US$ 0.039) per kg to 800 million people.
Besides, three months ration would be given to all in advance. Furthermore,
the government credited ₹500 (US$ 6.53) each to over 40.7 million “Jan
Dhan” accounts of women as relief package during corona outbreaks by April
2, 2020. The Rural Development Ministry said that by the end of April, the
ministry would credit more than 203.9 million women accounts.

Hospitals and Isolation Beds
India has not experienced corona pandemic related shortages of equipment
or hospitals so far. As per the National Health Profile-2019, India has 713,986
total government hospital beds with 40,000 ventilators (Ministry of Health
and Family Welfare, 2019). This availability of beds per 1000 population is
0.55 beds. The fragile healthcare infrastructure of the country will be
inadequate to cope with such an outbreak. So, the Ministry of Health and
Family Welfare decided on a pronged strategy to build new hospitals and
isolation beds in a short span. According to the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare, a total of 586 hospitals are recognized as COVID-19 devoted
hospitals with a capacity of over 100,000 isolation beds and 11,500 ICU beds
reserved for coronavirus patients (“586 COVID-19 hospitals,” 2020). The
government will import 10,000 ventilators from China-based manufacture and
has placed orders of 40,000 ventilators to Indian manufactures. Furthermore,
the Indian Railways converted 20,000 coaches into isolation beds, which can
accommodate 320,000 corona patients. Additionally, Indian Railways had
produced a total of 200,000 masks and 25,000 sanitizers.
Countryside’s situation and Discussion
A total of 566,840 confirmed cases with 16,893 deaths were considered for
this study. The mortality rate due to COVID-19 is 3.3%. The Maharashtra
state is highly impacted due to the corona outbreak with 174,761 number of
reported cases, while Delhi state is the third highly influenced state of India
with 87,307 cases. Significantly more cases have been seen in these states
because Maharashtra state is an economic hub of India, while Delhi is the
political hub of India, and both the locations have maximum movement of
aircraft to other countries. According to the Ministry of Civil Aviation,
460,429 number of aircraft movements have been recorded from Indira
Gandhi International Airport, Delhi, during the fiscal year 2018-19. As a
protective measure, India started the thermal screening of foreign travellers
since January 2020 at different airports throughout the country. Till March 4,
2020, 589,000 people were screened at airports. The Government of India
instructed them to quarantine themselves for at least 14 days at their homes.
On the contrary, a few of them violated self-isolation and became the carrier
of the coronavirus. This situation forced the government to call nationwide
lockdown on March 24, 2020. The nationwide lockdown helped India to slow
the stare of corona spread at 8% to 10% increment in daily cases, which was
in between 20% to 30% before complete lockdown. The cumulative new cases

reported daily now stood at 1684, and it has been projected that if a similar
trend continues, then the country will have zero cases by May 16, 2020
(Sharma, 2020).
A study by the ICMR explored the significance of complete lockdown in
the corona epidemic and showed that by April 15, 2020, India would have
seen a peak of 820,000 corona cases without a lockdown. Contrariwise,
migrant workers in large numbers thronged to Delhi interstate bus terminal to
reach their home town during the amid of lockdown on March 28, 2020,
notwithstanding the threat of the spread of the coronavirus disease (“India
lockdown: Migrant,” 2020). Most of them were from Uttar Pradesh state. The
Government of Uttar Pradesh arranged 1000 buses to ferry them to their home
towns. To prevent repetition of such incidents, the Government of India
ordered the state governments to set up immediate relief camps for the migrant
workers returning to their native states. On March 29, 2020, the Government
of India issued sweeping orders directing that the landlords should not demand
rent during the period of the lockdown and that employers should pay wages
without deduction. The people that violated the lockdown were to be sent to
government-run quarantine facilities for 14 days. A similar incident was
repeated in Mumbai on April 14, 2020, where approximately 3000 migrant
workers gathered outside the Bandra railway terminal get back their home.
The police forces controlled the crowd after resorting to the lathi-charge
(Mengle, 2020).
Developing countries like India have to fight on two fronts: first against
corona disease and second against misinformation. During “Janta curfew”,
one misinformation went viral on all social media that the government is
spraying "anti-corona" drug through helicopters in the country (Sengupta,
2020). Another viral message shared by many people, including few film
actors that the vibration generated by clapping together during "Janata
curfew" will kill the virus (“Mohanlal, many others,” 2020). One fake news
claims that staying home for 14 hours during “Janata curfew” break the chain
of transmission as the lifetime of coronavirus is only 12 hours (Ratna, 2020).
This message also claimed that “Janata curfew” will result in the reduction of
coronavirus cases by 40%. Indian film actor Rajinikanth has been taken down
by Twitter for violating the guidelines by sharing misinformation in which it
was claimed that a 14-hour stay home could stop the coronavirus disease
going from "stage 2" to "stage 3" (“Twitter takes down,” 2020). Another fake
news claims that doctors and health workers are the carriers of the corona
infection, which results in attacks and discrimination with them. There have
also been some incidents where health workers and police personnel were

abused. Those who are determined to be life-saving in the face of this
pandemic should criticize this kind of abuse and should raise their voice
against it on a personal level. The Government of India has embellished all
such workers with the name of Corona warrior. The government evicted them
from their homes over fears they may be carrying coronavirus. In cases
reported across the country, healthcare professionals described the growing
stigma they are facing from their neighbors and landlords, resulting in many
being refused taxis, barricaded from their own homes, or made homeless
(Datta, 2020; Sankar, 2020). The tourists from high-risk countries such as the
USA, UK, and Israel were facing hostility, including evictions from rented
homes due to misinformation (Purohit & Mukherjee, 2020).
A staggering case came into light on March 31, 2020, where after a 36hour operation, the government rescued 2300 people from a building of an
organization called Tablighi Jamaat. Out of them, 617 were having corona
symptoms and hospitalized in different hospitals in Delhi. After
investigations, the government revealed that this group organized a religious
gathering on March 13-15, 2020, in which approximately 5000 participated,
and many of them left for their home town before March 20, 2020, with corona
infection. Nearly 40,000 people were traced and quarantined who were in
contact with members of this group. In a shocking revelation, the Ministry of
Health and Family Welfare explored that nearly 30% i.e., 4291 cases of the
total coronavirus cases, were caused due to the gathering event in Delhi by
Tablighi Jamaat. This organization has been seen as a hotspot of a spike in
the corona cases in India with an increment rate of 20% in between April 1,
2020, to April 4, 2020. Despite the one or two incidents of nationwide
lockdown violations, most Indians have followed this nationwide lockdown.
As a result, India has succeeded to some extent in preventing the spread of
this disease. Home delivery arrangements of essential goods were made by
the government in big cities so that people came out of the houses in small
numbers. Along with this, the government issued e-passes to the persons
involved in essential services so that the essential services keep running
smoothly. The government increased awareness against COVID-19 in public
through various advertising mediums and also decided their participation in
this fight. People were educated about social distancing by the government so
that they do not come in contact with an infected person knowingly or
inadvertently. Till now, there is no cure for this disease in the world, so for its
prevention, keeping people away from each other is the only cure. If we do
not follow this social distancing, then this disease will spread in India like

other countries, which will create a terrible situation. Because a single infected
person can infect 2 to 3 people and those 2 to 3 people will further infect 4 to
6 people. This way, this sequence will go on, and it will become impossible
for any government to stop it. Additionally, personal hygiene has also
emerged as a major weapon in the fight against COVID-19. The WHO has
issued a guideline that if we want to stop this epidemic from progressing, then
we have to take special care of hygiene at the individual level. Every person
should wash his hands for at least 20 seconds. If we go outside the house for
any urgent work, then we should clean our hands with an alcohol-based
sanitizer at the time of time. The use of masks should be mandatory for every
person so that the disease does not spread from one person to another.
During this pandemic, surprisingly, a spike in cases of domestic violence
has come into the light. A study revealed that in the first 11 days of the
lockdown, 92,000 calls reporting domestic violence and abuse. The Ministry
of Child and Women Development explained the reason as it could be because
of the presence of abusers around the victim (Rukmini, 2020). As of June 30,
2020, the National Commission for Women informed that a 48% rise is
recorded in the cases of domestic violence in between March 23, 2020, to June
30, 2020. The commission has been reported a total of 587 cases of domestic
violence during the first phase of lockdown while they had received 396
complaints in the previous 25 days before lockdown (“Cases of domestic,”
2020). On April 20, 2020, the Delhi high court ordered the central government
on hearing public interest litigation filed by non-government organizations
that the government must take strict actions to curb the domestic violence in
lockdown (“Implement steps to,” 2020). Accordingly, the government started
a 24x7 helpline and constituted teams to rescue victims whenever a complaint
is being received.
With the development of the COVID-19 outbreak, India has strategized at
various levels to encounter it rapidly. Emerging state emergency situations
stipulated the public role and state responsibility. The state's initial responses
put the COVID-19 cases as low as 594 cases per million with such a large
population. The consequences of a pandemic can be noted in community
health, economy, and society. The increasing mortality or morbidity
heightened mental stress levels, which led to depression, fear, anxiety, and
emotional imbalance among the people and incited them to suicide. During
the lockdown, more than 300 people were committed suicide due to mental
torment in India. According to the data, out of these 300 “non-coronavirus
deaths,” 80 people ended their lives due to the fear of being infected and
loneliness. Furthermore, the wider consequences of a pandemic can be

observed in the social system, interpersonal relations, elderly issues, child
abuse, and violence against women.
Conclusion
Preventive measures to shape the actions government take prior to and during
an epidemic, we need to comprehend and captivate with the perspectives of
those actions. Viewed from the outside, the approach of the government
towards the pandemic can be presented as proactive. However, viewed from
the perspective of ordinary people involved in anticipating and responding to
infection, it is clear that the public has faced some problems with the complete
lockdown. During the pandemic, there are many challenges on different fronts
before the government, which the government can only face with the help of
the public. Decisions taken by the Government of India at the right time
prevented the spread of the disease to the third stage. The country, with a
population of 1.3526 billion, has proved that they are ready to make every
kind of sacrifice against this epidemic, whether it is at the economic level or
social level. According to one study, at least 136 million Indians will be
unemployed during the epidemic (Das, 2020). At such a time, every person
should come forward according to his ability to help all those who have
suffered the most outbreak of this epidemic. We can collectively deliver these
people with food and the items of their needs. At this time, according to
Mahatma Gandhi's principle of trusteeship, every competent person or group
should be led to meet the needs of the needy, which will collectively help in
defeating this epidemic. At the same time, the extent to which India has
expanded its health services on a war footing in such a short time has aroused
faith in the people.
