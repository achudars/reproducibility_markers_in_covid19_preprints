Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has limited individuals’ possibility to meet and socialize with others
due to the state of emergency restrictions to movements, events and relations imposed in different
countries. Most shops and restaurants have been closed and some economic activities have been
seriously damaged. This significant disruption may have contributed to a deterioration of
people’s mental health on top of other negative consequences of the pandemic.
To better understand the indirect consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak on people’s
lives

we

have

designed

the

intergen-COVID

online

survey

(https://sites.google.com/unifi.it/intergen-covid), carried out in France, Italy and Spain between
the 14th to the 24th of April 2020. Quota sampling on the population 18-plus and post-stratification
weights were used to achieve the alignment between the sample (N = 9,056) and the total
population on important socio-demographic characteristics.
We collected information on four key domains of individuals’ lives: intergenerational
(and other type of) relationships (physical and non-physical; means of communication;
frequency, etc.); living arrangements; mental health; events experienced during the lockdown
(e.g., income loss, death of relative/friend due to COVID-19, worsened partner relationships,
time spent with family); intentions for the future 3 years (e.g., fertility, living parental home,
marriage, cohabitation, divorce/separation, retirement).
In this paper we provide the main results from this survey, focusing on the first three
domains abovementioned. The fourth domain consists of questions applicable to different subgroups of the population and will be analyzed in separate papers. We show that, despite the
general reduction of physical contacts, with low educated people reporting a lower reduction in
all kinds of physical contacts, non-physical contacts have significantly increased, especially
among women. About 50% of respondents felt sad or depressed more often than usual during the
lockdown, but mental health deterioration was found to be heterogeneous and vary with
respondents’ age, gender and country. Job and income loss, and worsening of relationships
quality were other negative consequences often experienced during the lockdown, especially by
younger individuals. Finally, although maintaining physical distance, during the lockdown
people have experienced a high level of social connection, emotional support and practical help.

1. Introduction
The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) originated in China in December 2019 and quickly spread across the globe causing more than
9 million cases and about half a million deaths up to June 25, 2020 (WHO 2020). The necessity
to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has raised important challenges for governments
and societies that adopted different policy measures. As physical contacts are a necessary
condition for SARS-CoV-2 transmission (Huang et al., 2020; Peeri et al., 2020), under the
coronavirus state of alarm people have been advised to keep ‘distance’ from each other and stay
at home (Kumar, 2020). To ensure that physical distance was respected, some governments
imposed different types of lockdown measures (such as prohibition of public events, the closure
of schools, universities and non-essential workplaces, limiting public transportation, travel and
movement restrictions and limiting physical interactions). France, Italy and Spain were
particularly damaged by the virus (Ceylan, 2020) and were among the first countries in Europe
to lock down completely to reduce the contagion.
Social scientists have been focusing on understanding the unequal spread and lethality
COVID-19 across countries and age groups (Arpino et al., 2020; Dowd et al., 2020; Esteve et al.,
2020). The indirect impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, e.g. due to lockdown restrictions, are also
expected to be serious and broad in terms of life domains involved including fertility plans (Luppi
et al, 2020) and economic conditions (Bonaccorsi et al, 2020). According to Evandrou et al.
(2020), the lockdown has brought disruption to daily life for the whole population and measures
adopted to contain the virus are likely to leave their mark by producing detrimental effects on
financial, relational, physical and psychological domains. It has also been argued that
vulnerabilities to COVID-19 are expected to be heterogeneous within the population, so that the
short- and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 crisis are likely to vary (Mikolai et al,
2020).
The unprecedent situation created by the outbreak responses makes urgent to understand
how lockdown measures have affected individuals’ lives. To this end, we have designed an online
survey administered by the Lucid company on a total sample of 9,186 individuals living in Italy,
Spain and France conducted in April 2020. The survey targeted people aged 18+. We used quota
sampling and post-stratification weights to better achieve the alignment between the sample and
the population on the distribution of key socio-demographic characteristics.
In this paper we aim at contributing to shed light on the indirect consequences of COVID19 on people’s lives posing particular attention on social relationships, mental health, but also on
other events, such as income and job loss and having experienced the death of relatives or friends
due to COVID-19. Moreover, we examine whether the lockdown had an unequal impact on
2

groups of the population defined by key socio-demographic characteristics, i.e., age, gender and
education, as well across the three considered countries.

2. Data and Methods
We carried out a survey named intergen-COVID. The data have been collected through the online market survey platform Lucid, that offers the opportunity to purchase samples for survey
research, showing to produce high quality, representative samples (Coppock and McClellan,
2019). More specifically, Lucid recruits respondents through a three steps process (Callaghan, et
al., 2019): (1) suppliers collect lists of potential survey respondents and invite them to take part
in the survey; (2) Lucid administers a general set of variables such as gender, age, region,
educational attainment and income to be submitted to individuals who agreed to participate; (3)
based on information collected in step (2), Lucid invites individuals to take part to the survey
using quota sampling, namely splitting up the population into as many sub-sets as the
characteristics we want to observe and in a way that the proportion of each sub-set in the sample
is the same as in the population. This procedure ensures that the final sample is nearly equal to
the country benchmark.
Through the intergen-COVID survey we collected information on four key domains of
individual’s life: intergenerational (and other type of) relationships (physical and non-physical;
means of communication; frequency, etc.); living arrangements; mental health; events
experienced during the lockdown (e.g., income loss, death of relative/friend due to COVID-19,
worsened partner relationships, time spent with family); intentions for the future 3 years (e.g.,
fertility, living parental home, marriage, divorce, retirement). The survey was carried out in each
country in the respective official language. Most of the questions were drawn from validated
European surveys1 and the full English questionnaire is reported in Appendix A.
The target sample was of 3,000 individuals per country. Data were collected between
April, 14th and April, 24th 2020. Although the sampling was not probabilistic, Lucid targeted
representativeness on age, gender, education and region of residence within each country.
Moreover, we used post-stratification weights to minimize deviations from the benchmark
population. The post-stratification weights are obtained by following the European Social Survey
procedure (ESS, 2014). More specifically, this procedure adjusts the weights in such a way that
they replicate the distribution of three population distributions (so called Control Data): one for
the cross-classification of age and gender (AG), one for the cross-classification of age and
education (AE) and one for the region of residence (R). The population distributions of the

and Retirement in Europe (SHARE).

adjusting variables are obtained from the national statistical offices (respectively: INSEE for
France, ISTAT for Italy and INE for Spain and). Unavailable population statistics from the
national statistics offices were obtained using EUROSTAT data. The weighting procedure used
has the great advantage to allow the achievement of the alignment between the distribution of
key socio-demographic characteristics in the sample and that in the known population.
The method of calculating post-stratification weights was based on the STATA package
“ipfweight” (Bergmann, 2011). More specifically, this method generates weights through
iterative procedure that performed stepwise adjustments of the weights until it has achieved the
margins of Control Data, as defined by the three weighting dimensions defined above (AG, AE,
R). The procedure of deriving post-stratification weights has been applied country-by-country.
The following section reports descriptive statistics on the first three domains of the
intergen-COVID survey listed above. Estimates are obtained using the post-stratification weights
and are presented by age, gender, education and country. As for age we generally consider five
age groups: 18-25, 26-35, 36-49, 50-64, 65+. Gender is a dummy variable taking value 1 if
respondent was a woman and 0 otherwise2. Education is re-coded into three categories based on
the International Standard Classification of Education, where a “low” educational level is defined
as below secondary education, “medium” as up to high-school and “high” refers to a university
education or above. Finally, country is a 3-level categorical variable indicating the country where
respondents were living at the time of the survey (France, Italy or Spain).

3. Results
3.1 (Intergenerational) Relationships during the lockdown
Figure 1 reports weighted descriptive statistics of the decreased level of physical contacts during
the COVID-19 pandemic by age (Panel a), gender (Panel b), country (Panel c) and education
(Panel d). Overall, almost 75% of the respondents reported a reduction of physical contacts
during the lockdown. Although we did not find noticeable differences by gender and age, we
observe that low educated people reported a lower reduction in all kinds of physical contacts
compared with both medium and high educated people. Finally, a higher proportion of
individuals living in Spain and Italy reported a decrease in all types of physical contacts (about
80%) compared with those living in France (63%).
Intergenerational physical contacts have been reduced particularly among younger adults
aged 26-35 (57%) and 36-49 (56%) compared to the oldest one (48%). This could be due to the
need or wish to avoid contacts of grandchildren with older people and it is supported by looking
2

Gender was assessed in the questionnaire as follow: male, female, other. However, since the number of respondents
indicating “other” as response were few (N = 56; 0.61% of the sample), we dropped them from the study.

at individuals in this age range with at least one parent alive and distinguishing between
respondents with and without children (Figure 2). Figure 2 shows weighted descriptive findings
of decrease in physical contacts between respondents and their parents by own parenthood status:
a) by gender and age groups (26-35 vs 36-49) and b) by country and age groups (26-35 vs 3649). Overall, we notice that a reduction of physical contacts with parents was less frequent among
childless respondents, especially among men and in the youngest age category considered (2635). A cross-country comparison (Panel b) shows similar percentages of individuals that reduced
physical contacts with their parents among childless respondents when comparing France, Italy
and Spain; instead, among parents we observe a higher prevalence of individuals that reduced
contacts with their own parents in Italy and Spain, where intensive grandparental childcare is
more common. The reduction of contacts between individuals with children and their parents
may have followed the initial hypothesis that children were “superspreaders” of SARS‐CoV‐2,
like they are for other respiratory viruses, which was then not supported by the evidence
(Ludvigsson, 2020).
Yet, while most of the individuals reported a reduction in physical contacts, non-physical
contacts have increased in all countries and for the sociodemographic characteristics considered
(Figure 3). Particularly, over 50% of the respondents in each age group reported increased nonphysical intergenerational contacts, with young adults reporting it in the highest proportion (61%
of respondents aged 26-35; Panel a). With regard to gender (Panel b), we found that 75% of men
and 78% of women reported an increase in all kind of non-physical contacts. In a cross-country
comparison (Panel c), Spain is the country showing the highest prevalence of respondents who
increased their non-physical intergenerational contacts. Low educated respondents were those
reporting in a lower prevalence an increase of intergenerational non-physical contacts (47% vs.
57% and 56% of those with a medium and high level of education, respectively; Panel d). Overall,
findings on non-relatives, other relatives and all type of relationships were strongly in line with
those commented above.
More specifically, 48% of the respondents reported an increase in non-physical contacts
with friends (Figure 4, Panel a). Among those aged 65+, an increased in non-physical contacts
with children was reported by more than 45% of respondents and an increase in non-physical
contacts with grandchildren by about 30% of them. Men and women reported similar percentages
of increased relationships with children, grandchildren and parents while a slightly higher
proportion of women reported to have increased – during the COVID19 pandemic – their nonphysical contacts with grandparents (11% vs 9% of men), other relatives (44% vs 39%) and
friends (52% vs 45%). Overall, Spain is the country with the highest prevalence of respondents
reporting any kind of increased non-physical contacts (82% vs 73% in Italy and 71% in France).
5

Figure 5 shows changes in non-physical contacts by video calls (Panel a, b), social media
(Panel c, d) or instant messages (Panel e, f) by age groups and education level. Although the clear
age gradient of having never used video calls (Panel a), social media (Panel c) and instant
messages (Panel d) – reported by about 30% of 65+ vs 8% of 18-25 – we notice that more than
half (55%) of the respondents showed an increase in video calls and instant messaging. Overall,
73% of the respondents increased daily non-physical contacts, especially women (75%).

3.2 Mental health during the lockdown
About 47% of respondents reported to have felt sad or depressed more often than usual during
the lockdown (Figure 6) revealing a great heterogeneity by age, gender and country. Depression
and feeling of sadness were relatively more frequent among individuals aged 26-35 in all three
countries (Panel a). Moreover, a higher prevalence of reported depressive symptoms were found
for women as compared to men (58% vs. 46%) in Spain (Panel b) and among medium and high
educated respondents as compared to their lower educated counterparts

both in Italy

(respectively: 49% and 44% vs. 41%) and Spain (53% and 48% vs. 38%; Panel c). Similarly,
about 35% of respondents declared to have felt lonely more often than usual during the pandemic
and in all three countries the prevalence of respondents who felt lonely was highest in the age
group 26-35 (between 39 in France and 44% in Spain), although a non-negligible percentage of
respondents aged 18-25 also reported to have felt lonely more often than usual during the
lockdown (up to 38% in Italy). A wider gender gap was found in Italy with 40% of women (vs
29% of men) reporting to have felt lonely more often than usual (Panel e). Finally, although in
Italy similar percentages of loneliness were reported across educational levels, inconsistent
results were found for Spain and France in this respect (Panel f).

3.3 Events experienced during the lockdown
Figure 7 shows weighted descriptive statistics for other important consequences of the COVID19 pandemic that individuals may have experienced. Apart from the expected reduction in
physical exercise, also income, job and quality of relationships have been significatively affected
during the pandemic. A noticeable variation by age has been observed (Panel a), especially with
regard to income loss. Indeed, weighted descriptive statistics show that it was particularly
frequent among individuals aged 26-49 (about 40%). Moreover, it is interesting to note that 31%
of respondents aged 18-25 experienced difficulties in studying/working from home. Overall, men
and women did not significantly differ in terms of main reported consequences of COVID-19 on
daily life (Panel b) except for income loss which was reported by a slightly higher proportion of
women (33% vs 29%).
6

We detect a reduction of physical activity in each country (Panel c). Interestingly, a
reduction in daily life domain was among the most reported with the highest percentage found in
Spain (63%), followed by Italy (47%) and France (40%) according to where the measures to limit
outdoor sport activities have been the most restrictive. The second most commonly reported
domain of change was the income loss which has been respectively reported by 35% of
respondents in Italy and Spain and by 24% in France. On the other hand, a high percentage of
respondents reported to have spent more time with their family. Specifically, it has been reported
by 44% of respondents in Italy, 36% in Spain and 21% in France. However, overall, 11% and
13% of respondents reported worsened relationships with partner and other people, respectively.
With regard to education (Panel d), we detect that events experienced during the lockdown were
– overall – less reported by lower educated people compared with both, middle and highly
educated.

3.4 Help and support received during the lockdown
Overall, about 53% of respondents reported to have received some kind of help from others
during the lockdown (Figure 8). Panel a presents weighted descriptive findings by age groups
showing that a higher proportion of younger respondents reported to have received emotional
support compared with the older generations, with the lowest percentage reported by the age
group 50-65+ (about 37%). Moreover, we notice that older generations were also those showing
the lowest percentage of received financial help (2% among 65+).
A wide gender gap was found for emotional support which was reported by 38% of men
and 50% of women (Panel b). With regard to differences across countries (Panel c), we found
the highest percentage of emotional support received in Spain (53%), followed by France (41%)
and Italy (37%). Finally, an educational gradient has been found for emotional support which
was most frequently reported by higher educated groups (Panel d).

4. Conclusion
The significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality and morbidity is already evident.
This paper has focussed on the indirect consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak due to the
policy responses, that although necessary to contrast the diffusion of the virus, have imposed
restrictions to contacts, movements and economic activities. These indirect effects are expected
to be substantial and broad in terms of involved life domains. To understand the indirect
consequences of COVID-19 outbreak, we presented results from an online survey conducted in
France, Italy and Spain in April 2020. This survey provide timely insights on how the outbreak
responses are affecting individuals lives in four domains: intergenerational (and other type of)
7

relationships (physical and non-physical; means of communication; frequency, etc.); living
arrangements; mental health; events experienced during the lockdown (e.g., income loss, death
of relative/friend due to COVID-19, worsened partner relationships, time spent with family);
intentions for the future 3 years (e.g., fertility, living parental home, marriage, cohabitation,
divorce/separation, retirement).
Our intergen-covid online survey was conducted in the three European countries that first
implemented nationwide lockdown measures in March 2020. Data have been collected between
the 14th to the 24th of April 2020, i.e. about 1 month after the entry into force of the restrictive
measures. Quota sampling on the population 18+ and post-stratification weights were used to
achieve the alignment between the sample (N = 9,056) and the total population on important
socio-demographic characteristics.
In this paper we report the main descriptive results from the intergen-covid survey.
Additional findings and publications based on this survey will be listed on the dedicated website:
https://sites.google.com/unifi.it/intergen-covid.
The analyses in this paper generally point at considerable effects of the lockdown on
relationships, mental health, income and employment. We also found that these consequences
vary according to individual characteristics and among the considered countries.
We show that, as a consequence of the lockdown, the great majority of individuals in all
countries reduced physical contacts. Both intergenerational and other types of contacts have been
reduced. Intergenerational physical contacts have been limited particularly between younger
individuals with children and their parents, suggesting the need or wish to avoid contacts between
children and their grandparents. This is also consistent with the finding that a higher prevalence
of reduced contacts with parents was found among individuals with children in Italy and Spain,
where intensive grandparental childcare is more common.
On the other hand, our results also demonstrate a high degree of interpersonal
connectedness and solidarity. In fact, the reduction in physical contacts has been accompanied
by a similar increase in non-physical relations. Therefore, physical distancing has been
compensated by social contacts at a distance. The increase in non-physical contacts was
particularly evident in Spain, the country that experienced the most stringent lockdown measures
among the three considered and where physical contacts were reduced the most. Men and women
reported similar percentages of increased relationships with children, grandchildren and parents
while a slightly higher proportion of women reported to have increased their non-physical
contacts with grandparents, other relatives and friends. We also document an increase in digital
communications: more than half of the respondents reported an increase in video calls and use
of instant messaging to keep contacts at a distance.
8

Not only non-physical contacts have increased during the lockdown; a considerable
percentage of individuals also received emotional support and practical help during this period,
with strong heterogeneities within and between countries. Received emotional and financial
support was lowest among individuals aged 65+. Emotional support was also more likely to be
received by women and individuals with higher levels of education. Comparing the three
countries we analyzed, the highest percentage of emotional support received was in Spain.
The impact of lockdown measures on mental health is worrying. About 50% of
respondents felt sad or depressed more often than usual during the lockdown. Mental health
deterioration was found to meaningfully vary by age, gender and country. Increased feelings of
depression and sadness were relatively more frequent among individuals aged 26-35, among
women (especially in Spain), and among medium and high educated people.
Finally, our results demonstrate that other frequently reported significant negative
impacts concern the economic sphere and labor market, especially for younger individuals.
About 40% of individuals aged 26-49 reported an income loss and almost 10% of them lost their
job during the lockdown. These negative consequences were particularly strong in Spain and
Italy, and slightly more often experienced by women than men.
All in all, our study demonstrates strong and broad negative consequences of the
lockdown on mental health, income and employment. On the other hand, while physical contacts
have been considerably reduced, solidarity has been maintained by increasing non-physical
contacts and by provision of emotional and instrumental help.
