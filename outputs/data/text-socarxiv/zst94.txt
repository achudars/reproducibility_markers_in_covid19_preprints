"10" "Introduction :  Willingness to participate in COVID-19 testing and tracing programs  has potential to exacerbate health disparities due to systematic variation  by  social determinants of health . This study evaluates  socio demographic, economic, and psychological factors  associated with COVID-19  testing motivations."
"11" "Methods :   We use d  data from the Person to Person Health Interview Study, collected by telephone in April and May 2020 , using  a representative sample of Indiana residents (n=943). Testing intentions  we re assessed across  six motivations: treatment affordability, ability to work if positive, hospital effectiveness, symptom severity, proximity to infected, and risk of transmitting to others.  Bivariate analyses and ordinal logistic models  were used to assess  the influence of race/ethnicity, education, financial strain, and COVID-19 worries on each outcome."
"12" "Results :   Respondents strongly agree that  symptom severity, proximity to infected, and risk of transmitting to others   would be   important   considerations  in  COVID-19  test decisions.  Black and Latino respondents  were  more likely than white respondents to agree that ability to work if positive ( b  = 0.48 and 0.96) and hospital effectiveness ( b  = 0.92 and 0.96) would influence their decision to get tested.  T est affordability ( b  = 2.80), hospital effectiveness ( b  = 2.00), and risk of transmission ( b  = 0.99)  were considerations among participants reporting financial strain .  Desire to  reduce transmission ( b  = 1.49) and  concern about  proximity to infected ( b  = 2.66)  were reported among those who expressed COVID-19 worries ."
"13" "Conclusions :   In a representative sample in Indiana , p eople consider their own and others’ vulnerability to COVID-19 in testing decisions .   Lower-SES groups and  Black and Latino people were more likely to cite resource constraints. Policies expanding financial assistance and prosocial message framing may increase testing rates, particularly among vulnerable subpopulations."
"14" "Strict  COVID-19 social distancing measures  have been effective worldwide in reducing the spread of the virus, but are not a feasible long-term solution given the enormous cost to social and economic wellbeing. This has prompted  research on   “exit  strategies ”  that would permit activities and economies to remain open while still protecting healthcare resources and  reduc ing viral transmission.  Developing reliable models to guide such strategies requires  a better understanding of key parameters ,  leading to calls for   information on  social and behavioral heterogeneities that impact transmission. 1   Epidemiologists have advocated for robust testing and contact tracing as a potential solution to balance   public health and economic priorities , with research suggesting that an optimal system could prevent up to 80% of all transmission. 2  However, the success of testing and tracing efforts hinges on minimizing the delay between  symptom onset  and testing  and isolation of index cases , 3  with  a gap of 48 hours or less being critical for reducing the reproductive number. 2"
"15" "Though willingness of people experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 to participate in testing and tracing programs is likely to be an essential determinant of their efficacy, few studies have examined factors contributing to testing  intentions . 4,5   Initially ,  healthcare providers  served as gatekeepers , but a s test s have  become more readily available, patient self-selection i s becoming increasingly   important .  In the current pandemic, we have seen numerous examples of widespread testing refusal, and up to 30% of people report that they would not take a free COVID-19 test if it were offered to them. 5,6   Emerging  evidence suggests that perceptions of infection risk , 7,8   desire to avoid infecting others, 5   and  anticipated   financial  costs associated with testing ,  treatment , and quarantining may affect willingness to be tested for COVID-19. 4,9   However, to date, there have been no representative studies of motivations affecting  COVID-19  testing intentions."
"16" "Some  individuals, whether symptomatic or not, may not want to know their COVID-19 status. A growing literature on strategic ignorance suggests that people often ignore medical diagnoses or refuse testing despite being at risk. 10,11  There are  at least t hree  possible motivations for strategic ignorance :   1)  I nstrumental  f utility  occurs when  having the knowledge  will  not improve one’s ability to achieve a better outcome ;   2 )  Conflict avoidance  occurs when  having the knowledge would produce conflict between competing needs or values ; 5,11   and 3)  Hedonistic utility  occurs when remaining ignorant produces better psychological outcomes than having the knowledge (i.e., blissful ignorance)."
"17" "This knowledge gap regarding testing intentions is significant because unwillingness to be tested is likely to vary systematically across social determinants of health.   Specifically , the ability  of an individual  to successfully prevent or treat COVID-19 ( instrumental futility )   likely varies by  race and ethnicity, immigration status, socioeconomic status  (SES) , and other factors that are correlated with insurance  status , ability to pay for treatment, and access to well-resourced hospitals. 12,13  Likewise ,  these same social determinants are associated with the presence of competing demands, including  disproportionate  potential for job loss, inability to work from home, and inability to absorb income shocks associated with quarantine ( conflict avoidance ). 14–16   Conversely, having an understanding of  medical  risk  factors  and identifying with a COVID-19 high-risk group may work in the opposite direction, allaying psychological concerns related to stigmatization, ageism, and fear of the unknown ( hedonistic utility )."
"18" "Group  differences in testing intentions due to systemic inequalities have the potential to exacerbate  economic and health disparities in the US.  Transmission models that do not account for testing intentions and behavior are likely to  poorly estimate   the efficacy of testing and tracing strategies.   Moreover, u nderstanding motivations for testing intentions across different social  status groups is essential for developing effective and equitable strategies to prevent transmission, hospitalization, and mortality. In the current paper, we use data from a state representative panel study of Indiana residents  (N=9 43 ) to examine  demographic, economic, and psychological  factors influencing  six motivations for testing intentions: treatment affordability, ability to work if positive, hospital effectiveness, symptoms severity, proximity to infected, and risk of transmitting to others. We find significant and meaningful  variation  across social groups, who report differential social, economic, and psychological motivations for knowing (or not knowing) their COVID-19 status."
"19" "Methods"
"20" "To  understand   which factors influence COVID-19 testing  considerations ,  we use data from  a panel study,  the Person to Person Health Interview Study (P2P).  The  P2P contains  detailed  information about the demographics, health, economic status , and COVID-19 experiences  of  a  household-based stratified probability  sample of residents across the state of Indiana . Respondents participated in interviewer-administered surveys at two points in time, in the year prior to the pandemic (via face-to-face interview) and  during  stay-at-home orders in  the early stages of COVID-19  ( via phone interview;  between 2020-04-03 and 2020-05-30) .  We  include in our analysis sample those  respondents who answered all questions in our models (n =  943 ; original sample  n = 1026 )  and we adjust estimates with post-stratification weights to account for the P2P's oversample of demographic minorities."
"21" "Measures"
"22" "O ur outcome s   assess  whether  respondents ’   decision s  about  whether or not to be tested for COVID-19 would be affected by   one of the following six factors:   T he affordability of treatment if the respondent tested positive ( treatment affordability ),  whether  testing positive would require respondents to stop working ( ability to work if positive ) , whether  “ hospitals have what they need to treat ”   individuals who  test positive   for COVID-19  ( hospital effectiveness ) , the severity of respondents’ symptoms ( symptom  severity ), whether respondents had been around someone who had been tested positive   for  COVID-19  ( proximity to infected ), and  the risk  that respondents could infect other people ( risk to transmit to other ) , with response options  0 = strongly disagree, 1 = disagree, 2 = agree, and 3 = strongly agree."
"23" "We  choose predictors that can help us identify  how demographic, economic, and psychological factors  influence COVID-19 testing  considerations .   Among our demographic measures, we include  four  exclusive/nonintersecting  race  variables  ( W hite ,  B lack ,  Latino , and  other ),  four  dichotomous  measures of  educational attainment  ( bachelors or higher ,  some college ,  high school , and  less than high school ),   t hree dichotomous age variables  ( age 15-34 ,  age 35-54 ,  age 55+ ; in years ), and   one  dichotomous  sex  variable  ( female ).  We examine e conomic factors that contribute to testing decisions via respondent’s insurance status ( uninsured ), and  with a  financial strain  index   (Cronbach's alpha = 0.76 ; range 0-1 )   based on  each  respondent ’ s agreement to questions regarding their food, financial, and ho using  insecurity . Finally, we measure how psychological factors contribute to COVID-19 testing considerations with  three indicators:  (1)  A  COVID worry index   (Cronbach's alpha = 0. 8 4 ; range 0-1 )  based on the extent  that  respondent s   agreed that they worry  about   catching COVID -19 ,  worry about  getting severely ill from COVID -19, worry about COVID-19 prevention, worry about  friends and family catching COVID -19 , and  worry about friends and family becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 ;  (2) A   dichotomous variable  tracking  whether respondents have  had  any  COVID symptoms ;  (3) A  dichotomous measure of  know ing  someone   with   COVID-19  indicates  whether  the   respondents  knows someone personally, regardless of relationship, who has contracted the virus .   We  also estimated  models with indicators for health (physical health, diabetes, smoking behavior), but these were excluded from our final analyses due to their poor predictive power."
"24" "Statistical analyses"
"25" "First, we used descriptive statistics   to estimate the association of each outcome with race, education, age, financial strain, and COVID-19 worries  to establish easily interpretable ground-truths about these bivariate relationships . Next, we  used a series of regression models to estimate how  multiple factors work in tandem to influence COVID-19 testing considerations . Specifically, we  used  ordinal logistic regression models  for  each  outcome .   A ll models  include d   the  same set of predictors  and the same sample of respondents .   W e  also  adjusted  each  model with post-stratification weights and clustered all standard errors by shared county.  We provide graphical tests that each ordinal logistic regression fulfil l s the proportional odds assumption in  Appendix A ."
"26" "Results"
"27" "Table 1 provides univariate descriptive statistics  for  all variables . Overall, the  demographic characteristics of the weighted P2P sample are  in line with those of  Indiana  residents as a whole , with half ( 0. 50) of the respondents identifying as female,  0. 81 of respondents identifying as white, and the mean age of respondents at 45.79 years .  Rates of agreement  with  each outcome var y  widely, with  only  0. 23 of  respondents agreeing that their  decision to test for COVID-19 would be influenced by their ability to work if tested positive and  a majority ( 0. 84 )  of respondents agreeing that their proximity to people infected with COVID-19 would influence their decision to get tested.  In general ,  respondents  are  less likely to agree that  resource  considerations  (treatment affordability, ability to work if positive, and  whether their  hospital  is adequately resourced )  would influence their decisions to get tested for COVID-19  than  other types of   motivations ."
"28" "Figure 1 illustrates the percentage of  respondents from  each racial,  educational , and age group  that  reported agreement or strong agreement to  each outcome  that  a ffects their decision to get tested for COVID-19 .  There  are  stark demographic disparities  in how  resource  considerations affect COVID-19 testing decisions.  People  who identify as B lack  or  L atino ,  with  less than high school education, and below  the age of  35 reported  substantially higher levels of agreement that  treatment affordability, ability to work if positive, and hospital effectiveness would influence  their treatment decision s than did other racial /ethnic , educational, and age groups .  In other words, COVID-19 testing considerations among people in these demographic groups were more highly influenced by   resource  considerations  than individuals in other demographic groups .   The  remaining  outcomes (symptom  severity , proximity to infected, and risk to transmit to others) had relatively  limited associations with race, education, and age. However, people of other racial backgrounds had lower  agreement that the severity of COVID-19 symptoms would affect  their decision to get tested for  COVID-19 ."
"29" "The demographic groups that were most likely to agree that  resource  considerations would influence  their  decision to get tested for  COVID-19  are those that are, on average, less socioeconomically advantaged .  We  test this association directly  in  Figure 2, which  displays  survey-weighted  LOESS curves  for  each  outcome  by the   financial strain  index  and COVID  worry index. Consistent with our demographic findings, we see a linear association between   financial worry  and   each  resource consideration . For example, the average financial strain  index among people w ho  strongly disagreed that treatment affordability would influence their decision to get tested for COVID-19 was 0.35 , whereas individuals who  strongly agreed  had an average financial strain index of  0.5 2 .  On the other hand, t he COVID worry index had a slight positive association with most outcomes ;   COVID-19  worries only  had a clear positive association  with  testing considerations for questions pertaining to respondent’s p roxim i t y  to  individuals who tested positive with COVID-19 ."
"30" "Figure 3 displays parameter estimates from ordinal logistic regression  models  predicting a greement that  different  criteria would affect  respondents’  decision s  to get tested for COVID-19 .   Full t ables of these models with  parameters  for model  intercepts are reported in  Appendix B .  Parameter e stimates  in Figure 3  are reported in log odds , with   e stimates  above zero indicat ing  factors that increase  the  odds  of agreement to each outcome and  estimates  below zero indicat ing  factors that are negatively associated with  agreement to each outcome .  E stimates that are not statistically significant are colored grey."
"31" "Results from  multivariate models  presented in  Figure 3  are   largely   c onsistent with  bivariat e  findings  reported in Figure 1 .   Compared to  W hite  respondents ,  B lack  and Latino respondents  had significantly higher  log  odds  of   agree ing  that their testing decisions would be influenced by their ability to work if tested positive   ( b  =  0 . 48 and 0.96 )  and  by  the ability  of   hospital s   to  effective ly treat  COVID-19 symptoms  ( b  =  0 . 92 and 0.96 ) . Black  respondents  were also more likely to agree that the affordability of treatment would influence their decision to get tested for COVID-19   ( b  =  0 . 52 ) . On the other hand, people of other  racial groups  were significantly less likely to report that treatment affordability  ( b  =  -0 . 90 )   or severity of symptoms  ( b  =  - 1. 61 )   would influence their decision to get tested for COVID-19.  In comparison to people with a bachelor’s degree, i ndividuals with less than a bachelor’s education were  significantly  more likely  to state  that  treatment affordability and hospital effectiveness would influence  their COVID-19 testing decisions.  Compared to people aged 55+, younger people reported  a significant ly higher agreement that considerations of all types except  risk to transmit to others  would influence their decision to become tested for COVID-19.  Sex had a relatively limited association with treatment decisions; women only differed from men in their  propensity  to report the severity of their symptoms  ( b  =  0 . 33 )   as  a n important   consideration  in  their decision to get treated  for COVID-19 ."
"32" "Economic and psychological factors  also  had  significant associations with  treatment  considerations . Respondents who were uninsured were more likely to agree that treatment affordability would influence their decision to get tested for COVID-19   ( b  =  0 . 83 ) .   E xperiencing financial strain was strongly associated with agreement that treatment affordability   ( b  =  2.80 ) , ability to work if tested positive   ( b  =  2.23 ) , hospital effectiveness   ( b  =  2.00 ) , and risk to transmit COVID-19 to others ( b  = 0.99)  would influence  respondents’  decisions to get tested for COVID-19.  P sychological factors often had a n inverse association with outcomes that  were  highly  influenced by  resource  factors .  For example,  knowing someone that  tested positive for COVID-19 was negatively associated with the impact of treatment affordability on testing considerations  ( b  =  -0 . 33 ) ,   and experiencing COVID-19 symptoms oneself was negatively associated with the impact of hospital effectiveness on  testing considerations  ( b  = -0.61) .  However,  the  COVID worry index had a large positive association with the extent to which recent proximity to infected individuals  ( b  = 2.66)  and one’s risk to transmit COVID-19  ( b  = 1.49)  to other individuals would influence their propensity to be treated."
"33" "Discussion"
"34" "The goal of this study was to understand factors that influence people’s decision to be tested for COVID-19, and to examine how these considerations vary across social, economic, and psychological conditions.  We find that a strong majority of people would consider their own and others’ vulnerability to COVID-19   in making decisions about testing , including the severity of their symptoms, proximity to someone infected, and the risk of infecting others. In contrast, resource  considerations , including ability to pay for treatment, ability to work if positive, and the hospital’s capacity to treat them, are less salient to Indiana residents overall."
"35" "Though less commonly reported , resource  motivations  are  socially   stratified  such that historically marginalized groups are disproportionately likely to  consider  these factors in their decisions.   In particular,  Black and Latino respondents were  significantly  more likely to cite resource constraints as a consideration in testing decisions, even after controlling for being uninsured and experiencing material hardship and general financial strain.  Consistent with prior research, the basic survival needs of individuals and families often outweigh other considerations in healthcare decision-making, including prosocial motives like avoiding transmission to others . 17,18"
"36" "This  pattern of findings  has critical implications for population health and health disparities. Specifically,  even brief delays in testing can  have dire consequences for  the efficacy of contact tracing strategies  in  transmission  reduction . 2   If people in racial and ethnic minority groups and those in the lower socioeconomic strata  avoid or delay testing due to inadequate resources, public health programs will be less effective in these populations. Given observed patterns of segregation and homophily in the US, this may contribute to higher transmission rates  and the disproportionate burden of  COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and mortality in historically marginalized groups. 19–23"
"37" "Additionally ,  our  results are broadly supportive of research on strategic ignorance. 5,10,11  Reporting that testing decisions would be based on ability to pay for treatment or the capacity of hospitals to provide treatment may reflect instrumental utility, wherein knowing about being COVID-19 positive does not improve one’s ability to achieve a more positive outcome. Likewise, those who would consider their ability to continue working if they tested positive may avoid testing because it would produce a conflict between their personal  financial security and the prosocial benefit of protecting others from contracting the disease. For those in precarious economic conditions, knowing about COVID-19 positivity could threaten their ability to provide for the basic material needs of themselves and their families. Finally, among those who have an immediate vulnerability to COVID-19, because they have been exposed, are experiencing severe symptoms, or might infect loved ones, having certainty about COVID-19 status, one way or the other, may reduce psychological distress. Under these circumstances, the need to know and the fear of adverse outcomes may outweigh the psychological comfort of remaining ignorant."
"38" "Implications for public health policy and practice"
"39" "Absent readily accessible, compulsory testing strategies, factors that influence decisions to get tested will likely lead to disproportionate testing in specific groups. People who report more worry about COVID-19 are more likely to seek testing. These people are likely to be taking COVID-19 protective measures, resulting in routine under estimation of incident COVID-19 cases. Testing strategies that target representative samples help with estimating the impact of this bias on existing case counts and shape which populations would benefit most from interventions  to reduce COVID-19 transmission. Similarly, resource constraints more strongly influence testing decisions among those who report financial strain. This group is less likely to have the resources to be able to take COVID-19 protective behaviors. Policies targeted to alleviate financial strain, minimally including paid time off from work if sick or awaiting test results, may have impacts on testing behavior as well as more broad social benefits."
"40" "Coupled with these policies, an opportunity exists to frame testing messages to leverage concerns for COVID-19 vulnerability. Emphasizing the prosocial benefits of testing within an identifiable frame instead of in comparison to distant, general statistics would appeal to the overwhelming concern for the vulnerability of oneself and others. Content may include highlighting the extended work hours lost from untreated COVID-19 or the heightened risk for oneself and close others (friends and family). Especially when COVID-19 unequally impacts social and economic groups, focusing the on loved ones and the currently available options to reduce financial strain addresses likely cognitive dissonance."
"41" "Conclusions"
"42" "The most important finding to emerge from this study is the potential of economic inequalities to exacerbate health disparities.  The  COVID-19  virus  has disproportionately affected historically marginalized populations in the US , with the highest rates of infection, hospitalization, and mortality in racial and ethnic minority and lower-SES groups. 19–23   In parallel ,  public health measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission  have led to devastating economic consequences that are also unequal in their impact . E stimates of unemployment and income shocks due to  the partial closings of the economy  have been  most pronounced  in  Black and Latino  communities,  and among the less-educated and those living at or near the poverty line. 16,24–26   In turn, we find that social determinants of health – such as race and ethnicity, financial insecurity, employment,  and access to health care – shape variation in testing motivation and intention, which may accelerate transmission in these populations and impede public health interventions.   In short, social, health, and economic  stratification processes are  likely to be  mutually reinforcing in the current pandemic."

Estimates reported in log odds , a positive log odds indicates higher endorsement of a factor as an influence on future testing decisions .   Colored dots indicate statistically significant parameter estimates  and  grey dots indicate non-significant parameter estimates.  Estimates without easily observable lines have very small confidence intervals.  All models estimated with ordinal logistic regression ,  adjusted by sample weights ,   have  standard errors clustered by shared county , and are adjusted for all other covariates listed .
