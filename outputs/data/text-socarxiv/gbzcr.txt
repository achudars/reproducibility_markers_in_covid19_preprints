Abstract
The Coronavirus pandemic differentially impacted older adults in comparison to other
age groups, creating extended time at home and even limiting interaction with others. In order
to understand how individuals are coping with extensive time at home, we used a
representative sample of community-dwelling adults to examine how home experiences and
personal worries during the COVID-19 pandemic may differ across age groups, including
among older adults. Overall, we find fewer older adults experienced home-based stressors
(e.g. household conflict, lack of personal space) and fewer worries (e.g. related to finances or
boredom) that may arise during a disease outbreak with lockdown measures. Those ages 70+
who were living alone also faced fewer negative home experiences and worries than
individuals 60-69 years old living in single-person households. Supportive services to manage
such home stressors and worries might benefit all age groups.

Hunsaker & Hargittai: Age-Related Covid-19 Experiences 2

As the SARS-CoV-2 (or COVID-19) spread across the globe, older adults were
especially hard hit. This age group was at greater risk of having a more difficult illness
trajectory and faced higher mortality rates from COVID-19 than other age groups (T. Chen et
al., 2020; Garg et al., 2020; Garnier‐Crussard et al., 2020; Heymann et al., 2020). Guidelines
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2020) recommended strict adherence to
safety measures for individuals 65 years and older. These additional precautions intended to
protect older individuals from contracting the illness, including staying at home and isolating
oneself from others, constitute an especially drastic potential change in behavior and social
context, beyond the behavior expectations for all ages. Additionally, stay-at-home precautions
that single out older adults – while direly critical – mask the evident heterogeneity in the
health and well-being of this age group (Lowsky et al., 2014) that underlie assertions to limit
using chronological age as a sole measure of one’s risk for adverse health effects from
COVID-19 (Ayalon et al., 2020) or as a criterion for triaging care (Swiss Academy of Medical
Sciences, 2020).
Heterogeneity among older individuals and the high likelihood of extended time at
home may result in varying home experiences and life stressors during lockdown measures.
On the one hand, this time may create positive and productive moments, as well as the
opportunity to connect with loved ones (GlobalWebIndex, 2020, p. 11; Nguyen et al., 2020).
On the other hand, extensive time at home during quarantine can also lead to social isolation,
loneliness, and feeling confined (Brooks et al., 2020), while greater time for interaction with
others may lead to feelings of being overwhelmed and missing personal space (The Harris
Poll, 2020, p. 144). Older adults already experience social isolation and loneliness more than
other age groups, feelings that lockdown measures may exacerbate (Holt-Lunstad, 2017),
although younger people report feeling more socially isolated during lockdown measures than
older adults (GlobalWebIndex, 2020, p. 9).

Hunsaker & Hargittai: Age-Related Covid-19 Experiences 3

Across age groups, the psychological impact of quarantining during disease outbreaks
can be extensive and enduring (Brooks et al., 2020; Gardner & Moallef, 2015). Opinion
articles on the Coronavirus pandemic suggest older adults may be particularly at risk of
negative psychological effects and increased stress in both the short and long-term from
isolation measures (Galea et al., 2020; Steinman et al., 2020). In order to understand how
individuals are coping with extensive time at home, this paper uses data collected among a
U.S. national sample to examine how time spent at home experiences and worries during the
COVID-19 pandemic may differ across age groups. We specifically compare adults ages 60+
to adults ages 18-59 and consider the situation of people 70+ in particular. We also examine
whether people living alone experience lockdown measures differently from others. By
exploring the implications of COVID-19 and how they may uniquely impact older adults, we
may be able to improve decision-making approaches for how to support older adults through
isolation measures, including when isolation orders are relaxed.
Home Experiences and Worries
When hardships or life-changing events occur, individuals initiate coping strategies to
get through and manage their new life circumstances (Folkman, 1984). Past research shows
that older adults may differ from other age groups in how they perceive stress as well as how
they cope during stressful times (Folkman et al., 1987; Hamarat et al., 2001), variations that
extend to different older adult age groups (Aldwin et al., 1996; Hamarat et al., 2002). During
the COVID-19 pandemic, different age groups may have wide-ranging experiences related to
being at home (The Harris Poll, 2020, p. 144), as well as differing worries resulting from a
prolonged amount of time isolating (Barber & Kim, 2020).
Stressors that occur during isolation measures in previous disease outbreaks include
feelings of boredom, frustration, and social isolation that resulted from the loss of routine and
reduced in-person social contact, as well as fears of infection that can lead to lasting

Hunsaker & Hargittai: Age-Related Covid-19 Experiences 4

psychological distress (Brooks et al., 2020; DiGiovanni et al., 2004; Hawryluck et al., 2004).
A survey of the mental health of different generational groups during COVID-19 found that
similar percentages of baby boomers reported anxiety, stress, and depression in comparison to
Generation X and Millennials (GlobalWebIndex, 2020, p. 12). However, more Millennials
reported a greater connection to others (31%) in comparison to Baby Boomers and Generation
X (24% and 21%, respectively; GlobalWebIndex, 2020, p. 12). This suggests that older adults
might be more at risk for social isolation, and may therefore experience differing
psychological responses or display varying coping mechanisms during disease outbreaks.
Some studies have examined psychological responses to disease outbreaks among
older adults (Yeung & Fung, 2007; Yip et al., 2010), including research on the experience of
older adults during COVID-19 (Losada-Baltar et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). In fact, these
studies of psychological reactions to stay-at-home orders during the Coronavirus pandemic
found that older adults may be coping fairly well. Italian adults under stay-at-home orders
during the COVID-19 pandemic expressed more resiliency (less distress) than people of other
ages (Losada-Baltar et al., 2020). In China, older age during COVID-19 was associated with
greater life satisfaction (Zhang et al., 2020) although this may just reflect the general pattern
that older adults tend to have higher life satisfaction than their younger counterparts (Thomas
et al., 2016). A study comparing the emotional responses and coping strategies of different
adult age groups during and after the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong found that older adults
were better at managing their emotional response to the crisis and adjusting their coping
approaches over time (Yeung & Fung, 2007). This finding suggests that older adults who may
have past experiences dealing with chronic health management or previous traumatic
experiences viewed the situation as more manageable.
Given the extreme circumstances of staying at home during the Coronavirus epidemic
and that these circumstances may differentially impact older adults and other age groups, we

Hunsaker & Hargittai: Age-Related Covid-19 Experiences 5

explore the experience of coping with being at home during these times and the stressors that
can occur during disease outbreaks. We specifically focus our examination on the home
experiences and life stressors for older adult age groups (60-69 years, 70+ years) in
comparison to younger ones. We address the following research questions:
RQ1: Are older adults reporting similar/different home experiences compared to other
age groups and are experiences different among the younger versus the older old?
RQ2: Do older adults indicate different worries about varying life aspects compared to
other groups and are experiences different between the younger and the older old?
While social isolation emerges as a key concern across age groups during the
Coronavirus pandemic, a significant portion of older adults already experienced social
isolation or a lack of social connectedness prior to this disease outbreak (Holt-Lunstad, 2017).
Living alone – the home situation for over one quarter of U.S. older adults (27% for ages 60
years and older; Ausubel, 2020) – can put one at risk of social isolation (Iliffe et al., 2007;
Victor et al., 2000), especially with lockdown measures in place. A body of studies report that
social isolation and loneliness are risk factors for depression, low quality of life, and mortality
(for a review, see: Courtin & Knapp, 2017). Whether individuals are living alone may indeed
impact how one experiences sheltering in place, which can have dire consequences. A
qualitative study of suicide notes left by older adults during the SARS outbreak found that the
reasons given for suicide alluded to both suffering from and anticipating social isolation,
loneliness, and being confined at home, as well as fear of contracting SARS (Yip et al., 2010).
Since living situation (whether one lives alone or with others) can impact how individuals
both experience and cope with such extended time at home, we also examine this factor
during COVID-19. We ask the following research questions:
RQ3: Do home experiences differ across age groups for those living alone?
RQ4: Do worries differ across age groups for those living alone?

Hunsaker & Hargittai: Age-Related Covid-19 Experiences 6

Overall, we explore the heterogeneity that may occur in how different age groups,
including age groups comprising older adults, experience a disease outbreak and related
isolation measures. We additionally examine whether living alone exacerbates negative home
experiences or worries for these age groups.
Data and Methods
Data collection
We contracted with the Cint survey firm to administer our online survey using the
Qualtrics platform (other examples of using Cint’s panel for scholarly research include: De
Choudhury et al., 2014; Hunsaker et al., 2020). Cint uses a double opt-in procedure to recruit
people to its panels. First, people sign up to request participation in survey studies and then
they have to confirm that interest when they are sent an email confirmation. They then opt
into specific studies by responding to email invitations. This is the extent to which we
obtained consent, a double opt-in to the panel and then an opt-in to the study itself. In order to
achieve a diverse sample of community-dwelling adults, we applied quota sampling on age,
gender, education and region according to U.S. Census data. All 50 U.S. states, as well as
Washington, D.C., are included in the sample. We received 1,441 responses of which we
discarded 67 (4.6%) that failed on two or more attention-check questions, resulting in a total
of 1,374 valid responses which form the basis of our analyses. The sample includes valid
surveys from 316 older adults (ages 60+ years, 105 of whom are 70+) and 1,053 younger and
middle-aged adults (ages 18-59 years).
Measures: Independent variables
Sociodemographics. We measured age according to birth year and created the age
groups, 18-59, 60+ and 70+ for age-related comparisons. Gender options were female, male,
and other from which we created a gender dummy for female (=1). Race and ethnicity were
collected using questions similar to the U.S. Census by first asking whether the respondent

Hunsaker & Hargittai: Age-Related Covid-19 Experiences 7

was of Hispanic or Latino descent, followed by asking about race with the categories: White,
Black or African American, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or
Pacific Islander, and/or other; we created dummies for all of these categories. We collected
education level by asking participants to indicate their highest level of school completed and
then recoded to high school or less, some college, college or more. We measured employment
status and collapsed working full-time or part-time, being self-employed, and being in the
military to indicate being employed. To measure living situation, we asked separate questions
about whether respondents lived with other adults and if they lived with children under age
18. We combined these questions to one variable indicating whether one lives alone or with
others (other adults or children).
COVID-19-related medical experiences. To establish whether participants are highrisk of complications from COVID-19, we asked about the following medical conditions: high
blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease/heart disease, chronic respiratory disease,
lung disease (such as asthma, COPD), cancer, conditions and therapies that weaken the
immune system, taking an immunosuppressive medication, and being pregnant. These were
collapsed into a binary variable to indicate the presence of any such pre-existing conditions.
We also asked whether respondents had a positive test for COVID-19 and whether they knew
someone who tested positive. We additionally included a question about knowing someone
who had died from COVID-19.
Measures: Dependent variables
Home experiences during COVID-19. To measure how individuals are experiencing
home life during COVID-19, we asked: “How does the current Coronavirus pandemic affect
your circumstances at home? Check all that apply.” Participants could check any of the
following positively-worded items: (a) more calmness and relaxation; (b) strengthened
family/partnership; (c) more personal time; and any of the following negatively-worded items:

Hunsaker & Hargittai: Age-Related Covid-19 Experiences 8

(d) tensions and conflicts in the household; (e) feeling trapped; (f) lack of personal space or
alone time. These items were presented in randomized order. In addition to reporting findings
item by item, we aggregated positive statements and negative statements separately to indicate
whether respondents reported any of these item groups, respectively.
Worries during COVID-19. We measured worry during the disease pandemic with
the following question, “Since the Coronavirus outbreak, have any of the following been
worrying you more than usual, even if only in a minor way? Check all that apply.” Options to
check off included: ሺaሻ finances; (b) getting food or medication; (c) your own safety /
security; (d) Internet access; (e) boredom; and (f) future plans. We additionally created a sum
of worries, ranging from 0-6, as an indicator of amount of COVID-19-related worry overall.
The sample
Table 1 provides the descriptives of our sample by age group, including
sociodemographics and medical experiences with COVID-19. Briefly, those ages 60 and older
had a mean age of 67.91 (SD = 5.56, the oldest respondent age 82) while those ages 18-59
averaged 38.93 years (SD = 11.20). Each subsample had somewhat more women than men
(59% for those 60+ and 53% for those 18-59, one 20-year-old indicated “other” for gender).
Older adults are not as diverse racially and ethnically as the younger group (83% of those 60+
are white compared to 59% of those 18-59) reflecting wider societal patterns in the United
States regarding racial and ethnic diversity (Vespa et al., 2020, p. 4). About half of people of
all ages have no more than a high school degree and under a third have a college degree. Not
surprisingly, considerably fewer older adults (24%) were employed compared to 60% of
others. While about a third of older adults reported living alone, this was under a fifth for
those 18-59.
Over half of older adults (57%) reported health conditions putting them at risk for
developing severe illness from COVID-19, while this was true for 31% of individuals ages

Hunsaker & Hargittai: Age-Related Covid-19 Experiences 9

18-59. Fewer older adults (13%) knew someone who had tested positive for COVID-19 while
19% of 18-59 year-olds knew someone with a positive test. Of note, none of the older adults
in our sample reported having a positive case of COVID-19 while 2% of the younger
subsample did so. This could reflect the fact that older adults diagnosed with COVID-19 may
not be in a position to respond to a survey. Five percent of older adults and 6% of the younger
sample reported knowing someone who had died of Coronavirus complications.
Analysis
We completed a series of t-tests to compare older adults (ages 60+) to younger age
groups (18-59), as well as individuals ages 60-69 to those ages 70+, on home experiences and
worries. To examine whether home experiences and worries differ within each group (ages
18-59, 60+, 60-69, and 70+) according to whether one lives alone or with others, we
additionally ran t-tests to analyze comparisons within groups.
Findings
Home Experiences
We found no difference in experiencing any positive home circumstances when
comparing those 60+ years to individuals ages 18-59 (see Table 2). However, significantly
more individuals ages 60-69 reported positive home experiences in comparison to those 70
and older. When turning to specific positive home experiences, significantly fewer people
ages 60+ reported strengthened family and partnerships, but that was the only statistically
significant difference for positive experiences. Significantly more people ages 60-69 reported
strengthened family and partnerships and more relaxing moments compared to people ages
70+ but there was no difference in having more personal time.
Regarding negative experiences, significantly fewer people ages 60+ reported them
than the younger age group. We found no difference between the older age groups in
experiencing negative home circumstances, including for item-level measures. For specific

Hunsaker & Hargittai: Age-Related Covid-19 Experiences 10

negative experiences, household conflict was much less common among older adults
compared to younger adults, as was feeling trapped, and lacking personal space.
When examining home experiences within each age group by whether one lives alone
(see Table 3), significantly fewer older adults (60+ years) living alone reported any positive
home experiences compared to older adults living with others, although it is worth noting that
the types of experiences we measured were likely going to change more for those who live
with others (see more on this in our discussion of the paper’s limitations). The same findings
resulted when comparing living situation among people 60-69 years and 70+ years; fewer
people living alone reported any positive home circumstances. For individuals 18-59 years, as
with older adults, fewer people living alone reported positive home experiences. In comparing
home experiences item by item and for each within age group comparison, significantly fewer
people living alone reported strengthened relationships.
There was no difference in whether those ages 60+, 60-69 years, or 70+ years reported
any negative home experiences overall by living alone versus living with others. Unlike older
adults, however, fewer adults ages 18-59 and living alone experienced any negative home
circumstances compared to those living with others. When looking at specific negative home
experiences, fewer people 60+ years who were living alone reported household conflict and
lack of personal space, compared to those living with others. Among those 60-69 years, fewer
of those living alone reported household conflict while no other items differed by living
situation. We also found no differences in specific negative home experiences by living
situation for individuals 70+ years. Younger adults ages 18-59 living alone reported fewer
negative home experiences for all specific items.
Worries
Older adults ages 60+ reported fewer worries than those ages 18-59 (see Table 4). In
teasing out difference among older adults, we found those ages 70+ years reported

Hunsaker & Hargittai: Age-Related Covid-19 Experiences 11

significantly fewer worries than individuals ages 60-69. When examining worry item by item,
we found fewer people ages 60+ reported worries regarding finances, Internet access,
boredom, and future plans compared to younger age groups. Of note, more people ages 60-69
years worried about finances and future plans compared to those ages 70+.
When examining worry within each older adult age group (60+, 60-69, 70+) and
according to whether one lives alone (Table 5), we found that older adults do not differ in
amount of worry by living situation. However, for individuals ages 18-59, people living alone
reported fewer worries than those living with others. When examining specific worries,
significantly fewer individuals ages 60+ and ages 70+ who were living alone reported worry
about safety/security than those living with others. Older adults ages 60-69 did not differ in
worry about safety/security according to living situation. Among individuals ages 18-59
years, significantly fewer people living alone reported worry about getting food and medicine
as well as safety/security compared to individuals living with others. No other worries
significantly differed by living situation within these age groups.
Discussion
This study explored how time spent at home and personal stressors during the
COVID-19 pandemic may differ across age groups, comparing older adults ages 60+ to
younger adults ages 18-59 as well as examining differences between older adult age groups
(60-69 versus 70+ years). Overall, it was less common for older adults than younger ones to
experience potentially stressful home circumstances (e.g. household tensions, feeling trapped,
lack of personal space and time) that can occur as a result of movement restrictions during a
disease outbreak (The Harris Poll, 2020, p. 144). However, similar numbers of older adults
and younger individuals benefitted from sheltering in place through increased moments of
calmness, strengthened family connections, and more personal time. This mirrors past
research on social connection during times of crisis that found no difference across age groups

Hunsaker & Hargittai: Age-Related Covid-19 Experiences 12

with regard to interest in creating connections with loved ones (Fung & Carstensen, 2006),
and differed from times of “normalcy” where older adults tend to seek out such connections
more than younger adults (Fung et al., 2001).
That fewer older adults reported strengthened partnerships than younger individuals
might be accounted for by stage of life. For older individuals, strong ties to others, developed
over a lifetime, may already exist, and leave less room for enhancement during lockdown
measures. Indeed, previous life transitions, such as retirement and bereavement, can
strengthen social connection for this age group (B. Cornwell et al., 2008) meaning that
developing such connections during the extreme experience of a disease outbreak is less likely
to occur. Older adults may also be less prone to turn to digital media to create connection with
others when movement restrictions are in place (Nguyen et al., 2020).
Fewer more mature older adults reported strengthened relationships than the youngold. Previous work comparing old-age groups found that lack of social support was actually
beneficial to life satisfaction for the oldest-old yet detrimental for those in the young-old age
range (J. Chen & Jordan, 2018). The young-old may place more value on relationships with
family, while those in older age may derive more satisfaction from autonomy and
independence (Carstensen, 2006). Therefore, the older-old may not necessarily be missing out
on strengthened bonds with loved ones.
When examining the role of living situation, we found that across all age groups more
individuals in multiple-person households reported strengthened family and partnerships
during the lockdown measures than individuals living alone. However, this may well be due
to the measures we employed for assessing positive changes, as some of these focused on
social connection specifically within the household. For older adults, living alone is not
entirely indicative of social isolation (E. Y. Cornwell & Waite, 2009). Future work might

Hunsaker & Hargittai: Age-Related Covid-19 Experiences 13

examine how people perceive social relationships beyond their own households and during
times of crisis, particularly with regards to one’s living situation.
Stressful home experiences occurred more often for adults 18-59, which may be
because the particular stressors brought on by lockdown measures affected such people more
as they faced the extra likelihood of job loss, transitioned to working from home, and/or
managed childcare responsibilities. Indeed, we asked about time spent on homeschooling,
which we do not discuss in detail in this paper since it does not concern most older adults, but
it is clear that for people with multiple-person households, including children, such
responsibilities highly affected their home circumstances.
Older adults also reported fewer worries than younger adults, mirroring past studies
reporting on worries within different age groups both during COVID-19 (Bruine de Bruin,
2020; GlobalWebIndex, 2020, p. 12) and in studies overall (Basevitz et al., 2008; Hunt et al.,
2003). Our findings also support previous research on specific worries during COVID-19
reporting that older adults have similar amounts of concern as other age groups about securing
food and medicine, but less worry regarding finances (Barber & Kim, 2020).
When comparing different older adult age groups, we found that the young-old have a
greater number of worries than those in more mature ages. This follows past research
reporting lower anxiety among the older-old than the young-old (Byers et al., 2010). Our
findings also mirror previous studies showing that older adults may manage stress and
psychological distress better than other age groups in the times of a disease outbreak (Bruine
de Bruin, 2020; Losada-Baltar et al., 2020; Yeung & Fung, 2007; Zhang et al., 2020). Past
research reveals that older adults may implement methods to manage stressors more
proactively than other age groups, so that these stresses do not grow (Neubauer et al., 2019).
Shenk and colleagues (2009) suggest that older adults bring resilience to crisis situations that
come from their own lifetime of experience. That older adults experience fewer stressful

Hunsaker & Hargittai: Age-Related Covid-19 Experiences 14

home moments may point to notion that older adults are managing home life in such a way
that small aggravations do not develop into major stressors.
Of note, fewer older adults living alone reported worry about safety and security than
those living with others, implying that older adults with other people in their households feel
less safe. Those who are self-isolating and living alone may feel more assured that they are
limiting virus exposure, while individuals living with others may view this contact as creating
a risk for contracting the Coronavirus. When looking at the relationship between anxiety and
living alone more generally, anxiety tends to relate to living alone for this age group (Sun et
al., 2011). Our finding regarding less worry in relation to safety and security may be
indicative of the unique experience of living during a pandemic, where sense of safety from
living alone may be heightened because of one’s reduced viral exposure.
This study benefits from using a large representative sample to examine home
experiences and worries arising during a disease outbreak when to our knowledge often
studies rely on convenience samples for reporting on wellbeing and home life. One limitation
of our study is that the kinds of experiences that differ for people who live alone compared to
those who live with others may not have been captured in our measures. For instance, we did
not collect data on family caregiving responsibilities, which may indeed differ for those who
live alone in comparison to individuals living with others, and warrants examination.
Nonetheless we believe our measure captures some of the more universal home experiences
that occur during lockdown measures.
Conclusions
Overall, we find fewer older adults experienced home-based stressors and worries that
may arise during a disease outbreak when movement restrictions are in place. The older-old
also faced fewer worries than the young-old. Whether one lives alone seems to relate
differently to home experiences and worry within different age groups; older adults living

Hunsaker & Hargittai: Age-Related Covid-19 Experiences 15

alone experience fewer negative home experiences and less worry than their younger
counterparts whereas that comparison is different for those 18-59. Similar numbers across age
groups do benefit from the positive times offered by sheltering in place. Support in managing
stressors and worries that can arise during a disease pandemic might benefit all age groups,
including those living alone, as well as individuals who may be facing difficulties negotiating
life with others in close quarters.
