Abstract
Policy makers responding to COVID-19 need to know people’s relative valuation of
health over wealth. Loosening and tightening lockdowns moves a society along a (perceived) health-wealth trade-o↵ and the associated changes have to accord with the
public’s relative valuation of health and wealth for maximum compliance. In our
survey experiment (N=4,618), we randomize information provision on economic and
health costs to assess public preferences over this trade-o↵ in the UK and the US.
People strongly prioritize health over wealth, but the treatment e↵ects suggest these
priorities will change as experience of COVID-19 deaths and income losses evolves.
Information also has heterogeneous/polarizing e↵ects. These results encourage policy
caution. Individual di↵erences in health-wealth valuation highlight this study’s importance because they map onto compliance with current lockdown measures.
Keywords: Covid-19, health-wealth trade-o↵, information, value of life, lockdown,

At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and in the absence of medicine-based responses,
policy makers had to rely on behavioral interventions to slow the spread of the virus [1]. They
restricted individual freedom in many countries to prevent deaths through the transmission
of Covid-19. The reduction in deaths came, however, with an economic cost: the lockdown
restricted economic activity and led to falling output and income [2]. In e↵ect, policy makers
opted for health over wealth in what was a health-wealth trade-o↵ at the beginning of the
pandemic. They now face a similar trade-o↵ over how quickly and comprehensively to loosen
the lockdown. The quicker and more complete, the stronger the initial economic recovery but
also the greater the risk that COVID-19 deaths will increase again. Indeed, such trade-o↵s
are likely to be a recurring feature of the foreseeable future until medicine-based responses
are developed. When deciding where to position on such (perceived) trade-o↵s, policy makers
need to take account of the extent to which people think health matters more than wealth.
This is not just for the politics of these decisions but also for their efficacy: people tend
to comply with policies they agree with [3]. Policy makers also need to know how such
valuations might change as events unfold. For these reasons, it is important to understand
the public’s current valuation of health versus wealth and how this might change with new
information. This paper reports on a survey experiment designed to address these questions
in a representative sample of the UK and the US.
The survey consists of a sequence of binary choices between pairs of health and wealth
outcomes. Figure 1 shows the actual sequence of eight decisions between these pairs given
to UK and US respondents. If a person values both life and income and has a preference
ordering [4] over their various combinations, they should choose option A in Decision 1 and
option B in Decision 8. This is because, in Decision 1, A dominates B in both the health
and wealth outcomes, whereas in Decision 8, B weakly dominates A as both have the same
death outcome, but B is better on income loss. In the intermediate Decisions 2-7, option
A has the better health outcome and option B has the better wealth outcome. As subjects
move through Decisions 2-7, the health advantage of A over option B becomes progressively

1

smaller in terms of death avoided per unit of income lost. In this way, a person with a
preference ordering will switch from option A to B as they progress through Decisions 1-8.
Where they switch indicates how strongly they prioritize health over wealth: the later the
switch, the stronger the preference for health over wealth [5], [6].
Figure 1: Decisions for preference elicitation

The experimental element of the survey comes from our test of the stability of these
revealed preferences for health versus wealth. We asked respondents to make these decisions
a second time. After the first round of these decisions, they engaged in an unrelated task
and answered questions regarding their likely estimates of COVID-19 deaths and income loss
given the current lockdown. They were then divided randomly into 3 sub-groups and, before
the second round of decisions, one sub-group received information about predicted COVID19 deaths and another received information on predicted income losses due to COVID-19
mitigation measures. The final sub-group was our control and they heard a short piece of
instrumental music instead of information. If individuals change how they prioritize health
over wealth in one or both information treatments, this suggests priorities will change in
certain predictable ways as the experience of death and economic loss unfolds in the coming

2

weeks and months. In so far as there are no treatment e↵ects and individuals do not change
their revealed priorities significantly between the first and second round, the results point to
stability in priorities in the face of changing information.
Finally, we asked a series of demographic and attitudinal questions. This enabled us to
assess whether individual compliance with current lockdown measures is indeed predicted
by individual di↵erences in the valuation of health over wealth. We also tested for what
individual objective characteristics (e.g., age and income) and subjective ones (e.g., risk
tolerance and their perception of the threat of COVID-19) help predict these individual
di↵erences in the valuation of health versus wealth.
The survey was conducted between Friday 17 and Tuesday 21 April 2020: at the end of
the week when both the UK and the US were predicted to hit peak deaths [7], [8]. 2385 and
2233 respondents participated in the UK and the US respectively. The survey was conducted
using Prolific Academic and was pre-registered with EGAP [9]. We present full details on
sampling, the survey instrument and our estimation strategy in SM (section S1 and S4).
Figure 2 reports on the distribution of switch points in the UK and the US for those
switching only once in both the first and the second round, disaggregated by treatment and
control. The majority in both countries switch at Decision 8 in both rounds, indicating a
very high valuation of health over wealth for the majority. Based on such high valuations,
the original lockdown measures, that may have saved several hundred thousand lives in both
countries at the loss of perhaps as much as 10% of GDP, were consistent with the public’s
preferences for health over wealth. This, in turn, fits with the high trust and approval ratings
that governments enjoyed when the lockdown measures were introduced [10]. However, if
these high valuations remain [11], policy makers have a daunting task in calibrating the
relaxation of the lockdown. If the relaxation is accompanied by relatively modest increases
in deaths, then it will not be popular with the majority of the population in both countries,
even if it restores income losses. Therefore, it is important to assess this interpretation of the
survey results and the likely stability of this apparent high valuation of health over wealth.

3

This is what we do next.
Figure 2: Percentage of those who switch once, by decision switch point

On the interpretation of the evidence, a high valuation of health over wealth comes from
the analysis of those who had a single switch point and so behaved in a manner consistent
with having a preference ordering. This was the case for most observations: 75% fall into this
category. 15% showed multiple switch points; hence, though revealing a preference in their
individual decisions, these decisions do not cohere to form a preference ordering over health
and wealth. Such a proportion is typical [4]. The remaining subjects have no switch points:
respondents either always chose A, favoring health independently of the wealth consequences
(9%), or always B (1%). The preponderance in this group of non-switchers of those who
have a strict preference for health, whatever the wealth cost, reinforces the conclusion that
health is highly valued over wealth.
On the stability of this high valuation, we first analyzed the constancy of individual
behavior in the control group across the two rounds decisions are made (SM, section S3a).
Although some respondents change their switch point, most people in the control group
plausibly exhibit a stable preference ordering across the two rounds. With this result for
the control group, we now turn to the possible treatment e↵ects. We examined whether the
changes in respondents’ switch point between the two rounds are significantly di↵erent in
either of the treatments as compared to the changes observed in the control group. The
4

changes in switch point are, importantly, within-subject and we therefore make comparisons between-subjects in a treatment and the control group with treatment dummies in the
regressions in Figures 3-4 (also see SM section S2b-c).
We have three treatment e↵ects to report. First, an unconditional COVID-19 death
information treatment e↵ect in the UK: there is a significant increase in the number of
subjects who switch from having a single switch point on the first occasion to always choosing
option A (see Panel A in Figure 3). That is, they shift from having a preference ordering
over health and wealth to a strict preference for health, whatever its wealth cost.
Second, Panel B in Figure 3 shows a significant conditional treatment e↵ect in both the
US and the UK. Those in the income loss information treatment group who learned that they
underestimated the income loss are significantly more likely to move down from the Decision
8 switch point. 60% of the population switch at Decision 8 and 28% underestimated the
income loss. These e↵ects are very robust: they are supported by the between subject
analysis when comparing across the two treatment groups and the control (we report ATEs
in SM, section S3f). The last two plots in Panel B suggest that this treatment e↵ect, however,
does not occur throughout the range of possible switch points (i.e., for the other 40% of this
group).
These two treatment e↵ects suggest that people’s relative valuation of health over wealth
will change in predictable ways as the experience of death and income loss unfolds. In
particular, the longer the lockdown in both countries, the bigger the income losses and
the less likely are these losses to have been anticipated, leading to a reduction of the high
relative valuation of health over wealth. This has important policy implications. The public
will likely become more willing to countenance increases in deaths as the lockdown is relaxed,
the later and the slower is the loosening. This message is reinforced in the UK where this
valuation is likely to tilt in the opposite direction if COVID-19 deaths are salient, which is
more likely under an earlier relaxation of the lockdown.
The third treatment e↵ect can be seen in the second plot of Panel B. It is conditional

5

Figure 3: Treatment e↵ects

6

and qualifies the first e↵ect for those who underestimate COVID-19 deaths in the death
information treatment of the UK. Those who underestimate go in the opposite direction
to the general treatment e↵ect: they are less likely to move up to the maximum relative
valuation of health over wealth than in the control group. Examining the possible reasons
for this, we find that it is associated with individual respect for authority (SM, section S2e).
Those who have less respect for authority are, it seems, more likely to react perversely to
the death information by becoming less likely to value health relative to wealth so highly. It
is ‘as if’ they respond to information about the death toll being worse than anticipated by
‘refusing’ to update and decide instead that lives matter less: an informational backlash. This
treatment e↵ect—together with the first one—has the important implication that unexpected
deaths will polarize the UK public: death information generally increases the valuation of
health, but the reverse is true for those who underestimate the deaths.
Finally, in Figure 4, we present the regression results testing whether individual di↵erences in the valuation of health versus wealth are likely to influence policy efficacy because
they help predict di↵erences in individual compliance with the current lockdown in both
countries. They do indeed. Those who choose the maximum valuation of health over wealth
are twice as likely to strictly comply with lockdown guidelines in the UK and 1.5 times as
likely in the US compared to everyone else (see SM, section 2d). Thus, policy makers must
pay attention to the public’s valuation of health over wealth not only for electoral reasons
but also for reasons of policy efficacy.
We also considered whether any objective or subjective characteristics of an individual
help predict their relative valuation of health over wealth (SM, section S2g). In the US, the
key objective characteristic is voting for Trump, which is associated with an earlier switch
point and a lower relative valuation of health over wealth. By contrast, in the UK, voting
for Brexit does not help predict individual valuations, but age and education do. They are
associated, respectively, with higher and lower valuation of health over wealth.
We conclude that caution in relaxing the lockdown will allow the public’s currently high

7

Figure 4: Health over wealth preference and lockdown compliance

prioritization of health over wealth to evolve in ways that make compliance with a relaxation
more likely. Furthermore, as there are individual di↵erences that are also sensitive to information (see also SM, section 2h), policy makers need to be aware that the communication
of policy changes could polarize these di↵erences.

1. Materials and methods
a. Data and sampling
To conduct the online experiment, we teamed up with Prolific Academic, a web-based panel
with about 35,500 participants in the United States (US) and 44,600 participants in the United
Kingdom (UK) as of May 2020. Our quota-based sample was recruited between the 17th and
21st of April 2020. To generate samples for the US and the UK, we used the US Current
Population Survey (1), the 2011 UK Census (2), and the Scotland s Census 2011 (3). We
excluded Northern Ireland from the survey. We created a total of 170 subgroups weighted
based on age, gender, region and work status. Table 1 and 2 are the stratification tables for the
United Kingdom and United States, respectively, assuming a total (targeted) sample size of
2,500 respondents in each country. Table 3 reports the subgroups that we could not fill our
quotas completely on Prolific and thus weighted accordingly in our analysis to ensure
representativeness.
The average completion time was 33.58 minutes and respondents earned on average £3.08 for
their participation. The full survey instrument that we used is available in Section 4 of this SM
appendix. The data and code used for the analysis will be made available online at Harvard's
Dataverse for replication purposes upon acceptance for publication.

the age of 65, e indicates “employed” and u indicates “unemployed”.

b. Experimental design
Our survey experiment consisted of a sequence of eight binary choices between pairs of health
and wealth outcomes. Respondents read a short text on how restrictions on personal movements
help contain the spread of coronavirus and save lives but with a cost of disrupting and lowering
economic activity. They were then presented with eight decisions with each option giving a
12

combination of ‘lives lost per 1 million of the population through Covid-19 over the next 3
months and ‘the average loss of household income due to measures to prevent transmission of
Covid-19 over the next 3 months. In each of the eight decisions, they clicked on the option that
they think has the best combination.
We asked respondents to make these decisions a second time after engaging in an unrelated
task. Prior to repeating the task, respondents were divided into three groups. One treatment had
information about COVID-19 deaths; the other had information on income losses due to
COVID-19 lockdown. A control group heard a short piece of music instead of information.
Prior to treatment, they were further asked to provide their estimates of the (expected) number
of lives and amount of income lost due to COVID-19 and the associated lockdown.
Treatment information: Our treatment consists of two types of information prompts that are
shown to the survey respondents. The first prompt provides information about estimated lives
that will be lost (in the US and the UK) by August 2020 according to the IMHE (4). The second
prompt provides respondents with information on expected income (GDP) loses based on
estimates presented by the IMF (2). We present the exact wording of the two information
treatments in Section 4 of this SM appendix.

c. Empirical strategy
To estimate our main treatment effects, we analysed the data using two statistical forms – an
ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and a logistic regression – in order to identify the
causal effects of our treatment and how they interacted with respondent i s estimate of deaths
and income lost. Treatment assignment to one of the two groups (plus the control group) was
fully randomized. Such analysis allows us to understand which of the variables has a significant
impact on health-wealth prioritization.
We estimated the following two basic empirical models, whereby 𝐻𝐿𝑖 is the change (between
the two rounds) in respondent i s preference over health and wealth, 1 is the treatment effect,
2 the effect of respondent i s estimate of deaths interacted with the health treatment (T1), 3
the effect of respondent i s estimate of the income loss interacted with the wealth treatment
(T2) and 𝜀𝑖 the error term. In all our main specifications we used population weights (as
specified in Section 1a above) in order to able to make inference for the general US and UK
populations. We also clustered our standard errors at the regional level (US States and UK
NUTS-2 areas). Formally, we estimate the following equations:
(1)

𝐻𝐿𝑖 = 𝛽 + 𝛿1 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖

(2)

𝐻𝐿𝑖 = 𝛽 + 𝛿1 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 + 𝛿2 𝑡1 𝑥 𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖 + 𝛿 𝑡2 𝑥 𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖

Given that we are interested in within subject changes between pre- and post-treatment
preferences we do not control for demographics in our main estimation. Section 3b includes
the main treatment effects with demographic controls. Parameters 𝛿1 , 𝛿2 , and 𝛿 capture the
causal estimates of our treatment effects. Random assigned to treatment ensures the causal
interpretation of OLS estimates. The results of our main analysis are reported in tables 4-7
below.

Outcomes: Our outcome variable HL is measured in five different ways. We have two
categories of outcomes: a) binary ones (Switching Up; Switching Down; Down from maximum
value of life (VoL); Up to maximum VoL) and b) a continuous one (VoL). We detail each one
of them (and how we computed them) in S2a. In order to collect the outcome information, we
simply analyzed the responses that subjects gave in the two parts of the survey that contained
the eight binary decisions. The exact phrasing of those binary decisions and the questions used
to collect the outcome data can be found in Section 4 of this SM appendix where we have
included the full survey instrument.

Continuous variable capturing respondent i s minimum value of life elicited by the implied
value of life of respondent i s switch point. Section 2f lists the implied value of life for each
switch point in the UK and US, respectively.
Death estimates
Categorical variable equal to 0 if respondent i s estimate of deaths due to covid-19 is within a
range of +/- 5,000 relative to the IMHE estimate at the time of surveying, equal to 1 if above
and equal to -1 if below the range.

14

Income estimates
Categorical variable equal to 0 if respondent i s estimate of the income loss due to covid-19 is
within a range of +/- 1% relative to the IMF estimate at the time of surveying, equal to 1 if
above and equal to -1 if below the range.

All A

group

A significant proportion of respondents (12% pre-treatment and 9% post-treatment) chose
option A for all eight decisions. Given that these respondents chose a weakly dominated option
(the same number of deaths for a higher income loss), we do not include these subjects into our
main treatment effects analysis. Instead, we analyzed separately how our treatments affected
respondents move to and from choosing option A for all decisions. Table 8 reports the
treatment effects on this particular group of respondents.

d. Health-wealth preferences and compliance with guidelines
To assess the likelihood of compliance with government guidelines, we use pre-treatment
question 3 (“How likely are you to follow the government s guidance for reducing the spread
of Covid-19?”) and regress our outcome variables on the answer respondents gave to this
question. Specifically, we formally estimate the below model, whereby Compli is measured as
1) a categorical variable, ranging from 1 to 5, equal to the value respondents selected on pretreatment question 3 with a higher value indicating a higher likelihood of compliance and 2) as
a binary variable equal to 1 if respondents selected the answer “Very likely” and equal to 0
otherwise. As we are estimating the pre-treatment relationship, we include a vector of controls
𝛾𝑖 .
(3)

𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑖 = 𝛽 + 𝛿1 𝐻𝐿𝑖 + 𝛾𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖

Table 9 reports the results using the categorical outcome variable and table 10 reports the
results of the binary outcome variable. Both, choosing the maximum value of life and the
switch point, excluding the maximum value of life, affect compliance with government
guidelines in the US; yet, only the maximum value of life affects compliance in the UK. This
finding further emphasizes the importance of our main treatment effects, as these are all related
to the maximum value of life and not to the switch point people have more broadly.

e. Respecting authority in the UK
As can be seen in table 6, UK respondents who underestimated the number of deaths and were
assigned the Covid-19 deaths treatment were less likely to move to the top value of life posttreatment. This surprising result can be explained by people s respect for authority as table 11
19

reports below. The higher people scored on demographic question D9 (a higher score indicating
a preference to question authority), the more likely people who underestimated deaths and were
assigned the deaths information treatment were to reduce their likelihood of choosing the
maximum value of life. We interpret this result as an information backlash. People who
question authority are sceptical of the information we provide them with and subsequently do
not update their preferences on the health-wealth trade-off in response to our information.
Table 11 also indicates that including this interaction switches the signs of the interaction
between death treatment and underestimate of deaths without authority into the ‘correct
direction, further supporting the explanatory power of including respect for authority into the
analysis.

f. Estimation of implied value of life
Further to our main analysis of individuals switch points we estimated their implied minimum
value of life. Table 12 lists the implied value of life for the UK and the US given the decision
at which subject i switched from A to B.

g. Individual characteristics on health-wealth trade-off
To assess the impact of demographic variables on individuals perceptions of the health-wealth
trade-off, we regressed our set of demographic variables on the estimated minimum value of
life implied by people s choices in the preference elicitation task. Table 13 reports the results
for the United Kingdom and table 14 the results for the United States.

h. Additional subgroup analysis of main treatment effects
In addition to the analysis of our main treatment effects, we tested for interactions of treatment
effects with demographic variables. Table 15 and table 16 report two significant interactions.
Table 15 reports treatment effects in the UK interacted with age and table 16 reports treatment
effects in the US interacted with redistributive preferences. In the UK we find that respondents
over the age of 50 who were assigned to the wealth treatment were more likely to move away
from the maximum value of life post-treatment. In the US we find that people who support
more redistribution significantly reduce their implied value of life when assigned to the health
treatment. This effect is driven by those who underestimate deaths.

standard errors are presented in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. The categorical redistribution
variable is based on demographic question D9 and coded as “more redistribution” if respondent i indicated a value
of below 5, as “less redistribution” if respondent i indicated a value of above 5 and as “indifferent” for a value of

3. Robustness
a. Preference stability in control group
To have a preference ordering, there must be only one switch point each time a person faces
the eight binary decisions. There are some people who exhibit more than one switch point,
either the first or the second time they confront the binary options. We typically ignore a
person s choices when this happens. Those respondents – as well as those who did not choose
a switch point in either the first or second round of the experiment – are coded as missing in
our main variables.
To interpret our treatment effects as effects on preferences, it matters whether we can
reasonably assume that people who have a single switch point on each set also have a
29

preference ordering. This is not necessarily the case because anyone who chose a switch point
randomly would satisfy the condition of only switching once. And if random selection
explained their switch point then the treatment effect would be better interpreted as some
interaction with the randomization process. To test for this possibility, we analyze the stability
of preferences in the control group where no treatment effect could occur. We have evidence
of such consistency of choice between the first and second time these decisions are made, and
this would be unusual if people chose the switch point randomly (805 of 1,006 control grouprespondents who chose a switch point both pre- and post-treatment expressed stable
preferences). In fact, the probability of choosing the same switch point twice if the choice of
switch point on each occasion was random would be 1/8 (i.e. 8x 1/64), while we have 80%
consistent choices.
The number of preference-based choosers might be plausibly calculated in the following way
by allowing for strict preference followers, ‘fuzzy ones (defined below) and random choosers.
‘Fuzzy preference followers are people that know the region they like but not the precise point:
they cannot distinguish between adjacent switching points and so toss a coin. For example, if
someone thinks they should switch at decision 6 or decision 7, they toss a coin and might
choose 7. When asked again they toss the coin again and there is a 50% chance they choose 7
again and a 50% chance they now choose 6. Thus, there is a 50% chance that we observe one
downward movement. Alternatively, they could have chosen 6 in first place; then they have an
equal chance of staying at 6 or moving up to 7 in the second decision. For this person there is
a 50% chance they pick the same, a 25% chance that they move up and a 25% chance that they
move down. We have 136 respondent who change by one decision point, which would arise if
there were 272 people who had fuzzy preferences as defined above.
However, some people who just choose randomly would also change their switch point by one
position = 7/32. Since 1/8 of these random choosers would select the same point, it follows that
21/32 of the random choosers would move their decision by more than one point. We have 65
choices that move by more than one switch point. This would imply 99 random choosers in our
sample. This being the case, the random choosers would also account for 22 of the observations
of one switch point changes. We had 136 observations with one switch and so that leaves 114
of these choices to be accounted for by respondents with fuzzy preferences.
These overall 228 respondents with fuzzy preferences would produce 114 of the consistent
choices we observe (and we would expect 12 of these observations to come from the random
choosers). Thus, our residual number of genuine preference-based choosers is 679, with 228
fuzzy preference choosers and 99 random choosers. Overall, our sample therefore consists of
90% either consistent or fuzzy preference-choosers.

b. Main treatment effects with demographic controls
To further test the robustness of our results we estimated all our main treatment effects with
the within subject analysis and additionally included our demographic covariates. The results
of this analysis are reported in tables 17-20. All our main treatment results hold.

c. Main treatment effects with alternative coding of outcome
variables
Our main analysis coded each of the main outcome variables as 0 if either, subjects did not
move from their original switch point post-treatment or, if they moved in the opposite direction
to the captured direction of the outcome variable. To check the robustness of our estimates we
estimated our models included outcome variables only then equal to 0, when subjects did not
move from their original switch point post-treatment. Tables 21-24 report the main treatment
effects with this alternative coding of the outcome variables. The main results of our analysis
hold.

d. Main treatment effects with continuous death and loss
estimates
As we are primarily interested in how people respond to either underestimating or
overestimating the death and income loss of the pandemic, we used a categorical variable that
classified people as either underestimating, overestimating or having a correct estimate for both
variables. For robustness, we also ran our main analysis with a continuous variable for people s
estimates. The results of this test are reported in table 25. Unsurprisingly, the results of this
analysis differ from those of our main analysis and there are no significant interactions between
the treatments and continuous estimates of death and income loss. This result indicates that the
magnitude of respondents estimates does not affect their change in preferences over health
and wealth but rather whether these estimates over- or underestimate the impact of the
pandemic.

e. Main treatment effects with alternative coding of death and
loss estimates
As outlined in section 1c of this SM appendix, we generated the categorical over- and
underestimate of death and income loss variables by using the IHME and IMF estimates at the
time of surveying. A respondent s estimate is thereby categorized as correct if it falls within a
range of +/- 5,000 deaths or +/- 1% income loss, respectively, relative to the IHME and IMF
estimates. An estimate below the specified range is categorized as an underestimate, an
estimate above the specified range is categorized as an overestimate. In this subsection we ran
our main analysis with an alternative range to test for robustness. Table 26 reports the results
of the main treatment effects with interactions for a range of +/- 2,500 deaths and +/- 0.5%
average income loss. The main treatment effects hold. Additionally, the health treatment now
increases the likelihood of subjects in the UK to move away from the maximum value of life
post-treatment. Given that this effect does not hold in our models with the original range of
death estimates, we did not include this effect in our main analysis.

f. Average treatment effect using post-treatment data
Due to our survey design, we were able to conduct a within-subject analysis of respondents
change from pre- to post-treatment. As a robustness check, we additionally ran our main
analysis on the post-treatment data to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) between
treatment and control groups. Table 27 reports the ATE for both the US and the UK, without
death and income estimates; table 28 reports the ATE including interactions with those
estimates. Our treatment effects do not survive this alternative estimation, suggesting that our
demographics do not capture all differences between the control and two treatment groups.
Given that our within-subject analysis indirectly accounts for such differences, the results from
these models (tables 4-7) are less biased than those reported in table 27 and 28.

PART I

Preference elicitation

When the restrictions on personal movement are increased, coronavirus spreads more slowly
and so causes less loss of life because there is less peak pressure on the healthcare system.
However, increasing the restrictions on personal movement also tends to disrupt and lower
economic activity and this is associated with loss of income and jobs and some psychological
and health costs.
It is difficult to put numbers on these. Nevertheless, we present 8 decisions below and ask you
in each case to choose between two options. Each option has a combination of ‘lives lost per 1
40

million of the population through Covid-19 over the next 3 months and ‘the average loss of
household income due to measures to prevent transmission of Covid-19 over the next 3
months . In each of the 8 decisions, click on the option that you think has the best combination.

PART I

Preference elicitation

When the restrictions on personal movement are increased, coronavirus spreads more slowly
and so causes less loss of life because there is less peak pressure on the healthcare system.
However, increasing the restrictions on personal movement also tends to disrupt and lower
economic activity and this is associated with loss of income and jobs and some psychological
and health costs.
It is difficult to put numbers on these effects. Nevertheless, we present 8 decisions below and
ask you in each case to choose between two options. Each option has a combination of ‘lives
48

lost per 1 million of the population through Covid-19 over the next 3 months and ‘the average
loss of household income due to measures to prevent transmission of Covid-19 over the next 3
months . In each of the 8 decisions, click on the option that you think has the best combination.

The Washington-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) predicts that – with
the current government guidance in place – about 68,841 people in the US will have died due
to the coronavirus by August 4. This means that the number of Covid-19 deaths per one million
people would be 210.
