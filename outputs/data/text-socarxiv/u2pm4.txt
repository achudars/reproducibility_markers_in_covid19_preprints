"3" "Abstract"
"4" "The  latest   National Family Health Surve y (NFHS 5) ,  indicates that even before the pandemic ,   child stunting  in India  was  severe and  has been  deteriorating  since 2015 . But after the stringent lockdown, there  has been  a n  acute  increase in impoverishment as governmental food policies have  further  exacerbated rather than mitigated inequalities. Families eligible under the National Food Security Act (NFSA, 2013)  have been  provided with double food grain rations during t wo  waves of the pandemic . B ut   nearly  45  percent of  India’s  population  without these ration cards  have been excluded from any additional food relief from the central government.  Simultaneously , India’s  food grain stocks in government granaries  have  accumulated  manifold with  two years of  bumper harvests.  Therefore, in  light  of the  acute distress faced by marginalised communities due to the  pandemic  and  unprecedented economic recession,  th is  paper analyses the availability of adequate  foodgrain  stocks and contends that the time is ripe for the universal expansion of the public distribution system."

"7" "Introduction"
"8" "India has the world’s largest undernourished population  (FAOSTAT 20 21 ) . In 20 20 , the country ranked  94  of 1 07  countries on the Global Hunger Index   (GHI, 2020) . Further, children belonging to marginalised castes and tribes are more likely to be underweight  (NFHS, 2017) . In this scenario, the imposition of one of the most stringent COVID-19 lockdowns in the world  (Hale et al., 2020) ,  has  acutely exacerbated structural inequalities of caste, class, ethnicity and gender and intensified hunger amongst vulnerable communities.   The second wave of the pandemic has  been  particularly  catastrophic ,  for  both  lives and livelihoods."
"9" "The National Food Security Act , 2013  (NFSA)  guarantees  subsidised food grains  to  two of every three Indians   each  month .  Nevertheless, in  the last few years despite burgeoning food grain stocks in government warehouses,  there have been  a series of starvation deaths , especially  amongst marginalised castes and tribes  (Bhatia, 2018) . Further, since the abrupt lockdown in March, more than 200 people have reportedly died of starvation, financial distress and exhaustion  (Aman et al., 2020) .  Most  of these families, did not have functional ration cards to purchase subsidised food grains  to prevent starvation .  The latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS) ,  also indicates that in  13 of 17 Indian states the scale of stunted children has worsened or stagnated from 2015 to 2019   (IIPS and MoHFW, 2020) ."
"10" "Theoretically, the capabilities approach  analyses  th e  paradoxical phenomenon of ‘hunger amidst plenty’ due to acute inequalities in food distribution  (Drèze & Sen, 1991; Sen, 2003) . Based on this conceptual framework, this  analysis  seeks to  scrutinise  two elements of India n  food policy in the context of the pandemic. On the supply side, this  research  will  estimate projected  stocks in  government  warehouses ,  based on   information from government datasets. Then on the demand side,  this  analysis  will  examine  the implementation of food security measures ,  especially in terms of the capability of vulnerable communities to mitigate the impacts of  repeated  lockdowns .  In the context of the pandemic and unprecedented global economic recession, this research  contends   that the time is opportune for the universal expansion of food security protections, to  prevent  the  exclusion of  marginalised communities."
"11" "Intersectional Vulnerabilities and Universal Entitlements"
"12" "In  1996, economists  Jean  Drèze  and Amartya Sen in their book Development and Participation highlighted the jarring contrast in India,   ‘ of particular concern is the scandalous phenomenon of mounting food stocks against a backdrop of widespread hunger ’   (Drèze and Sen 2002:336) . More than twenty years later, despite  enactment of  a series of legislative  entitlements , in the midst of the pandemic ,  unfortunately this ignominy of ‘hunger amidst plenty’ has reemerged."
"13" "The  strident national and state lockdowns  have particularly  aggravated   multi-dimensional  inequalities.   Davies defines intersectional vulnerabilities as,  ‘ the interaction between gender, race, and other categories of social difference in  individual lives, social practices, institutional arrangements, and cultural ideologies and the outcomes of these interactions in terms of power ’   (Davis, 2008) . Therefore, especially given the gravity of undernutrition in India, the pandemic has amplified food insecurity amongst vulnerable communities."
"14" "However, social crisis as periods of accelerated change often function as policy levers to open unprecedented political windows of opportunity to bolster welfare systems  (Beresford, 2016; Hemerijck, 2011)  for their inherent value as  ‘ automatic stabilizers ’   (Ocampo & Stiglitz, 2018) .   The historical legacy of the post-war Keynesian welfare state, for example, have established the intellectual framework for the policy implementation of ‘cradle to grave’ social protection welfare measures  (Esping-Andersen 1989) .  World over, the pandemic has necessitated a fundamental rethink of citizen-state relations and the need for  ‘ radically transformative, egalitarian and inclusive ’  policies  (Leach et al., 2021) ."
"15" "In India the impact  of the contagion  has been so severe, that irrespective of the scenario of recessionary contraction of the economy, the pandemic is expected to contribute to half the estimated additional poor globally  (Sumner et al., 2020) .  Estimates indicate that  230 million Indians may have  already  fallen into poverty   (APU, 2021) .  Even before the pandemic, the Indian economy was experiencing the highest levels of unemployment in 45 years. Therefore, given the severity of  a series of national and state-level  lockdown s,  coupled with the existing depth of poverty and malnutrition in India, there is an acute need for a shift in the welfare regime towards universal food entitlements."
"16" "Before  1997, India’s subsidised public distribution system (PDS) was universally accessible to the entire population  through a well-established network of  more than 1 million fair price shops. Thereafter, the targeted regime  introduced  differential prices and entitlements  (Khera, 2009) . For nearly a decade, the selection criteria  to identify  eligible families officially as ‘Below the Poverty Line’ remained unaltered ,  despite  significant  inclusion and exclusion errors  (Hirway, 2003; Khera, 2009; NCAER, 2015; Sundaram, 2003; Madura Swaminathan & Misra, 2001) . With the  legal  enactment of the NFSA in 2013, the targeted approach continued albeit with a change in nomenclature and substantial expansion of eligible ‘priority’ families  to include  two-thirds of the population. Nevertheless ,  though exclusion errors declined overall, they remained substantial in backward states such as Bihar and Jharkhand  (Drèze et al., 2015) . The  series of starvation deaths  after the enactment of the law,  also,  indicat e  the inherent flaws of  restricted  targeting .  Marginalised communities w ith intersectional vulnerabilities  and weaker socio-political clout  are  invariably  at greater risk  of exclusion , despite their   legal  eligibility . With the pandemic, not only have millions been impoverished but the  targeted  exclusion errors ha ve  been  further  amplified.  O ddly ,  as a relief measure the  central  government  has provided an additional 5 kilograms of free  foodgrain   under the  Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana ( PMGKAY )   only  for  families with NFSA ration cards identified as  ‘ priority ’,  for a limited period  of a few months  both  in the first wave and second wave  of the pandemic . However,  families  without  these  ration cards have been  largely  excluded from  central government  food security protections.   Therefore, t his   targeted  food  policy has exacerbated inequalities."
"17" "Instead , especially in  a  scenario of mass impoverishment ,  universal programmes are  preferable  and considered to be more effective  (Ocampo & Stiglitz, 2018) . First, the equity argument intrinsic to the rights-based perspective assumes that  universal ly   justiciable legislative protections would be more inclusive  (Drèze & Sen, 1989) . Second, since universal programmes would include wealthier households, it is expected that their greater political clout will improve accountability  (Hirschman, 1970; Sen, 1992)  of the public distribution system. On the other hand, programs with limited beneficiaries often have weaker political bases and are more susceptible to rationalisation  (Skocpol, 1991) . Third, targeted systems are also invariably more predisposed to elite capture  (Bardhan & Mookherjee, 2005)  and exclusion of poor households  (Madura Swaminathan & Misra, 2001) . Fourth, information asymmetries invariably plague targeted programmes  (Madhura Swaminathan 2002) . Empirical research also indicate that,  ‘ take-up rates by poor households increase with benefits provided to nonpoor households ’   (Kochar 2005:233) . Expansion and universalisation of the PDS by several Indian states such as Tamil Nadu  (Chaudhuri et al., 2015) , Odisha  (Chatterjee, 2014)  and Andhra Pradesh  (Dutta & Ramaswamy, 2001)  have also proven to be superior in terms of the inclusion of poor households.  Further, in states with relatively well-functioning PDS, lower caste households tend to benefit more  (Das & Basu, 2014) .  Alternatively , geographical targeting to ensure universal coverage ,  at least in hunger-prone districts ,  is also a potentially viable strategy which in the Kalahandi- B o langir -Koraput (KBK) region of Odisha  ensured  improvement in both  household food intake and diet quality  (Rahman, 2016) ."
"18" "Demand Side:  Chronic  hunger and vulnerable communities"
"19" "In 2013, the  food  law  provided subsidised food grains to 800 million Indians  or two-thirds of India’s population .  However, due  to  rapid  growth , India’s   population  is  projected  to  have reached  1.3 6  billion by 202 1 .  Further, in the last decade,   despite economic growth since ration cards lists  were not updated, at least  100 million  persons  have  been excluded due to this anomaly alone   (Scroll, 2020) .  Of these missing ‘beneficiaries’ , the majority  may be  children  under the age of 10 years  born after the  2011  Census.   Further,  the process of selection of beneficiaries has always been  plagued  with targeting errors  (Drèze et al., 2017; Khera, 2015) . The insistence on linkage with the national unique identity number ,  a adhaar ,  has also deprived scores of  genuine beneficiaries  (Muralidharan et al., 2020) ."
"20" "Further due to rapid population expansion without commensurate increase in NFSA ration cards,  b ased on population projections  for 2021 it can be estimated that ,   45  per   cent of India’s population is  currently  effectively excluded from NFSA  ration cards   ( Table   1 ) .  U rbanised   and wealthier states  such as  Goa  and those in north-east India, have the largest proportion s  of left-out populations.   However,  poorer states such as Bihar and Jharkhand  have greater  exclusion s in terms of the  absolute  number of people   outside the  NFSA  ambit ."

"296" "Further, only some states such as Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh have invested  their own  state finances to expand  or universalise  coverage. However, populous states with high levels of poverty such as Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have not been able to effectively expand  their  food distribution systems . D uring  different phases of  lockdown s  their  populations  without  any  ration cards ,   have been  the most affected."
"297" "In this context,  amongst the  many  excluded population s ,   two   communities  most impacted by the lockdown  have been   internal  migrants  and  vulnerable  women. In most cases, within these  broader categorizations,  marginalised  castes, tribes, ethnicities and religions have been the most affected."
"298" "3 .1 Internal Migrants"
"299" "In the first wave  of the pandemic , t he Prime Minister announced the abrupt nationwide lockdown from 25 th  March 2020 with only four hours’ notice and unilateral cessation of all public modes of transportation with stay-at-home advisories. This triggered unprecedented distress-induced reverse migration from cities to villages, the largest in the country’s history since the 1947 Partition.  M ore than ninety percent of India’s labour force is employed in the informal sector. Therefore, millions of migrant labourers who depend on daily wages found themselves stranded in their places of work without income, employment, food, social protection or familial support. Consequently more than 20 million internal migrants  (Singh & Magazine, 2020)  are estimated to have defied lockdown orders to traverse hundreds of kilometres from industrial cities to distant villages.  No other country has witnessed a humanitarian crisis of this magnitude, due to a mismanaged lockdown."
"300" "Thirty-six hours after th is   hasty  shutdown  the government introduced  a few  food security  initiatives   under the  PMGKAY . However, the package increased entitlements only  for  existing beneficiaries of welfare programmes.  But most migrant labourers either do not possess ration cards or leave them  behind  in their villages for the benefit of their families.  After another inexplicable delay of three months, the government  finally  announced  t he  Atma   Nirbhar  package aimed to provide a one-off grant of 10 kilograms of food grains to 80 million migrant labourers without ration cards. But  due to excessively  centralised quotas  and insistence on identity proof,  only 12.5 percent of eligible migrants received  this  additional food grain  before  the deadline  (PIB, 2020) .  Despite an extension , only 33 per cent of the allocated  foodgrain s  for migrants was distributed  (Sharma, 2020) ."
"301" "Several surveys have  studied  the extent of their impoverishment both in cities where they work and, in  the  villages where they returned  (Table 2) .  In the first three weeks of the lockdown,  50 per cent of migrant workers  who reached out to helplines in distress  had rations left for less than a day   (SWAN, 2020) .   A survey by a consortium of civil society organisations in June-July 2020 found that  29 percent of migrants had  already  managed to return back to industrial cities for want of  skilled work in villages and 45 percent of those in rural areas were also equally eager to return  (VAF & Samboodhi, 2020) .   Pertinently, migrants from marginalised castes and tribes are more likely to engage in short-duration circular migration for survival  (Nayyar & Kim, 2018) .   However, in stark contrast to the central government, some states such as Rajasthan  did  provide universal   free rations to all residents  without need for any identity proof  which  ensured sustenance for  millions of stranded migrants."

"352" "Lastly, the most publicised initiative was the ‘One Nation One Ration’ (ONOR) scheme which  is supposed to enable migrants  to purchase subsidised food grains in any destination. However, this  policy  is restricted to only those  whose names have been included   in NFSA  ration cards .  Further ,  since biometric authentication has been suspended in several states to prevent the spread of infection,  the scheme has not been of much   utility  in the midst of the pandemic. As per the government’s  Integrated Management of Public Distribution System  (IM-PDS) database, in  May  202 1  nationwide less than  12 , 000   ONOR  ration cards  (0.005 percent of the total NFSA ration cards)  were processed.  In the second wave the situation has become so dire, without the early  announcement of a relief package for migrants ,  that the Supreme Court  on 13 May 2021  has ordered three states Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh  to  provide dry ration  and  set up  community  kitchens for migrants .  A few days earlier, t he Karnataka High Court ha d  also issued a similar order to open Indira Canteens to provide free food for all vulnerable people including migrants and the homeless."
"353" "3 . 2   Vulnerable  Women"
"354" "More than half of Indian women are anaemic  (NFHS, 2017) . Typically, the intra-household distribution of food acutely discriminates against women who eat last at family meals  (Coffey et al., 2015; Narayan, 2018) . Especially during times of food scarcity, nutritional consumption of women deteriorates  with  age within  Indian  households  (Shivkumar & Kerbart, 2004) . However, the lockdown policies initiated by the government  were  restricted to a modest cash transfer ($6.7 per month only) in 200 million  women’s  Jan  Dhan   bank accounts for only three months.  However ,  40 percent of women surveyed across 1 5  states in April and May reported that they were either not able to access the cash transfer or were unaware of its status   (Indus Action, 2020; Patel et al., 2020) . Two months after the lockdown, a phone survey by SEWA, a union of self-employed women workers across 12 states also found that 91 percent of their women members had borrowed money from extended family, 78 percent had completely depleted their savings and only half had received food rations from the government despite 70 percent being in possession  of a ration card  (SEWA Bharat, 2020) .  Similar to international trends, the number of domestic violence complaints received by the National Commission for Women (NCW)  in India  also doubled since the lockdown  (Nagpal, 2020) ."
"355" "Further, a meticulous survey by the NGO YUVA in Mumbai city in the early days of the pandemic found that as economic activity diminished and the spread of infection increased, homeless and trans people who depended on alms for a living were being increasingly shunned, discriminated against and were more impoverished than  before   (YUVA, 2020) .  Only some state governments such as West Bengal, Bihar and Telangana often on the directive of High Courts extended free rations to all transgender people.  In Delhi the All India Network of Sex Workers (AINSW) estimated that by the third month of the lockdown 60 percent of registered sex workers had returned to their villages as they faced imminent starvation without work or access to any form of government social security nets or food entitlements.  Eventually in September 2020, the Supreme Court based on a petition by the oldest sex workers collective,  Durbar  Mahila   Samanwaya  Committee (DMSC)   ordered that  all states  should  provide rations, without insisting on identity proof, to all sex workers identified by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and district authorities."
"356" "The network of women farmers,  Mahila   Kisan   Adhikaar   Manch  (MAKAAM) in a survey of 700 members  across Maharashtra also  found that 30 percent of single women  especially  those from particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs) and  denotified  and nomadic tribes (DNTs) were excluded from the PDS as they did not possess ration cards  (Kulkarni, 2020) . The monies offered under the government scheme Pradhan Mantri  Kisan   Samman  Nidhi (PM-KISAN) for farmers was also largely inaccessible to women farmers, tenants and landless labourers engaged in agriculture as eligibility depends on  ownership of land, which women are typically deprived of.  The Hunger Watch survey conducted in October 2020 also  found  that 56 per cent of  single women-headed households went to bed without a meal at least once in that month  (RTFC & CES, 2021) ."
"357" "Thus ,   internal migrants  vulnerable  women and marginalised communities   were   the  least likely to have access to targeted food rations  as  government entitlements, when they need ed it  the most during the pandemic lockdown."
"358" "Supply Side:  Foodgrain  mountains in government  granaries"
"359" "On the other hand, on the supply side, s ince the green revolution  in the sixties , India has  attained self-sufficiency  with   surplus food grain production.   India’s cereal production has increased 500 percent in seven decades from 48 million tonnes in 1951 to 292 million tonnes in 2019-2020. However, some states such as Kerala remain deficit states due to their limited sowing area and focus on cash crops.   Therefore, since its inception in 1965, the Food Corporation of India (FCI) has been procuring cereals from farmers at minimum support prices (MSP) in order to re-distribute them at subsidised prices to impoverished consumers and deficit states."
"360" "After the harvest, in June 2020 food grain stocks with the FCI were at an all-time peak of 97 million tonnes and exceeded its storage capacity of 75 million tonnes (Figure 1). Therefore, the prime minister’s announcement of free food   grains for 800 million Indians  with NFSA ration cards,  was also a  calculated measure  to offset rotting of food grains in  granaries in  the monsoon months  (Drèze, 2020) .  In June 2020, t he food minister h ad  admitted that the government, already ha d   ‘ sufficient stocks of food grains for two years to ensure food security for the whole country ’ ,  aside from  additional  future procurement at forthcoming harvests  (Agarwal, 2020) .  T he n, the   stocks  were  so excessive, that the  government has even  permitted diversion of  rice  for the production of  ethanol  for use in  alcohol-based hand sanitisers  (Hussain and Ranade 2020) .  Even in May 2021,  foodgrain  stocks  were 3.5  times more the buffer norm   (Hussain & Mohapatra, 2021) ."
"361" "Source: Based on FCI data on  stocks in Central Pool for the years 2005-2021"
"362" "https://fci.gov.in/stocks.php?view=46  (last accessed 12 April 2021)"
"363" "*Converted Paddy is Custom Milled Rice  that can be derived with an out-turn ratio of 67 percent from  unmilled  paddy as the norm specified in the FCI monthly  Foodgrain  Bulletins . The data on paddy procured has not been made available on the FCI website before 2013"
"364" "Instead, t he  additional  food grain requirement for universal expansion of the PDS at 5 kilo gram s per person per month, assuming even an exceptional ly high  99 percent offtake (except for 1 percent of income tax payers in the country) can be  estimated at approximately  30  million tonnes annually. With the existing stock  of 78 million tonnes  in g overnment warehouses  in April 2021 this target can be easily achieved. The  average  annual  government  procurement in 2019 was  86  million tonnes   in a year of  normal harvest s  and 95 million tonnes in 2020 with bumper harvests .  Further ,  even if the government were to extend the PMGKAY which provides 5 kilograms of additional free  foodg rains  to current NFSA ration cardholders for 6 months  in 2021  (from the current commitment of only 2 months)  and also simultaneously universalise the public distribution system to provide 5 kilogram s  of  foodgrains  for those without ration cards,  foodstocks   would  still be  more than  sufficient  (Table 3) .   W ith exceptionally good rains and despite the lockdown, a  bumper  harvest is also expected May 2021 .  On 3 May 2021 ,  itself ,  the  government had already procured 29  million  metric tonnes of wheat, which was 70 percent higher than the corresponding period the previous year  (PIB, 2021) .  Nevertheless , the  foodgrain  availability projections for 2021 and 2022 are  extremely   conservative in terms of availability of  foodgrains ,  to avoid unrealistic expectations .  Further ,  the government  always  has the possibility ,  in future ,  of increasing  the  minimum support  price  (MSP) provided to farmers  to  increase  procurement . F rom 2017 to 2020 , FCI procurement  average d  at around 32-37 per   cent of the annual harvests , with ample scope for expansion ."

However  the procurement in 2020-21 and 2021-2022 is expected to exceed these estimates substantially .   On 3 May 2021, itself, the government had already procured 29 million metric tonnes of wheat . By 18 May, procurement has increased to 37.6 million metric tonnes, with a government estimate of 42 million metric tonnes from the  rabi  harvest  (FCI, 2021) ."
"491" "** Estimated NFSA distribution includes  allocation for the  PDS along with  foodgrain s  for  the  Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), Mid-day Meal (MDM) and other legal commitments under the law  (Monthly Food Grain Bulletin,  ."
"492" "*** In April 2021, the government announced that 5 kilograms of free  foodgrain  would be provided to all NFSA beneficiaries for two months under the  PMGKAY  in May and June 2021. This estimate assumes that this initiative will be extended for at least another 4 months."
"493" "# Population projections for 2021 and 2022 indicate that 597 and 611 million Indians respectively, would be without NFSA rations cards unless there is an upward revision of population figures.  The assumption for universal coverage is that each excluded person will be provided with 5 kilograms of  foodgrain  each month   from  June  2021 ."
"494" "## Only for April 2021, the current FCI stock is calculated as the existing stock of rice, wheat and paddy in the FCI  godown  at the beginning of the month as per the FCI website. For  unmilled  paddy CMR is calculated based on an out-turn ratio of 67%."
"495" "Summary and Conclusion:  Time  for  universal food entitlements"
"496" "One of every four of the world’s undernourished people live in India  (FAO, 2020) .   In no other country in the world has an mismanaged COVID-19 lockdown, triggered a humanitarian crisis with an exodus of migrants. Besides, even before the pandemic, in 2019-20 India was already experiencing the  unprecedented  levels of unemployment and recession."
"497" "T he pandemic has exposed  and exacerbated  the inequalities in India’s food entitlements infrastructure. India  also is expected to have the  largest  population  impoverished due to the pandemic  (World Bank, 2020) . However, the central government is estimated to have spent less than 3 percent of GDP as a fiscal stimulus for food subsidy. This  minimalistic  support has also proven to be sorely inadequate to protect vulnerable communities  from food insecurity ."
"498" "Therefore, a perceptible need exists to universalise food entitlements to ensure that acutely marginalised populations especially migrants,  children  and women (including trans gender peoples  and sex workers) and those from disadvantaged castes, tribes and minority religions are effectively protected from impoverishment.  Even before the pandemic, studies had recommended universal allocation of a 40 kilograms of cereal per household with 5 kilograms of millets each month (Jha and Acharya 2013)."
"499" "Now, w ith more than three times the buffer storage norm of food grains currently in government granaries, the  time is opportune for the  central government  to  efficiently universalise the public distribution system  to prevent exclusion ."
