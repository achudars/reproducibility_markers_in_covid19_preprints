bibliometrics, COVID-19 pandemic, education, responses, synthesis, teaching

Synopsis Educators and teachers are often front-line responders with children and families in a crisis. The
COVID-19 pandemic was no exception. An effect-response model with adaptation can be applied to this
multi-role challenge that educators faced to educate, protect, connect, and foster the well-being mentally and
otherwise for students. This evidence can be used to explore the hypothesis that educators are high-performers
and functionally elevate their performance under duress to serve the public. The relative importance of
teacher performance during the COVID-19 pandemic was examined using scientific synthesis tools. An
effect-response-adaptation model was used to model all research, and the relative importance of various
responses implemented by teachers was explored. Research gaps and opportunities to better support and
enable education in future are proposed.

Viewpoint
A pandemic by definition has global global reach and thus dramatic ecosystem-level effects. The COVID-19
pandemic shifted every dimension of human endeavors including education. There was a demand and call for
emergency remote teaching (1), and in many regions of the world, this process shifted from extemporaneous
emergency education to persistent and sustained practice (2). At least 1.6 billion learners and 97% of the
students globally were impacted (3). Educators and teachers are often front-line responders with children
and families in a crisis (4). Teachers support and interact with children and their families. Schools define
the local community and neighborhoods. Universities and colleges can define the character, culture, and
economy of towns and cities. Thus, education is a fundamental component of human society (5, 6), and
the performance and action of educators can dramatically influence societal good, function, and many other
outcomes (7-9). The COVID-19 pandemic was no exception in its far-reaching effects as a crisis from
individuals to communities, and educators were impacted and forced to respond and adapt.
Human performance is defined in many domains of research. In the field of social sciences that directly
examines this concept, performance is a behavioral construct that is associated with a an individual (or team)
with outcomes driven by both personality and net cognitive abilities that are in turn dependent on context
and task (10). This complexity is not superfluous. The traits and skills of an individual are the starting point
or substrate for models of performance, and the cognitive abilities inform capacity to utilize these assets
in meeting specified outcomes. These processes of leveraging traits and skills do not happen in isolation
of context or from the challenge of a specific task. Consequently, routine performance in exceptionally
challenging circumstances or for particularly demanding tasks is exceptional. This premise is fundamental to
educators supporting learning and providing instruction throughout a pandemic. Stoicism or self-efficacy in
spite of incredible adversity has been proposed as the foundation that defines human performance (11), and
many other disciplines of performance research echo this sentiment (12-15). The wellbeing and performance
of teachers is thus a critical form of human capital in education and society (16) and a potentially important
metric of educational integrity (17). Furthermore, we propose that this resilience in crises is a critical lever in
maintaining a functional society.
A model that supports this starting point for educator performance in crisis contexts is needed. An effectresponse model with long-term adaptation can be applied to this multi-role challenge that educators face to
educate, protect, connect, and foster the well-being mentally and otherwise for students. We can borrow
from the competition and stress theory in the environmental sciences to structure an analysis of education
research here. Effects are external drivers on our focal subjects, i.e. educators, that can be contextual or from
other subjects (18, 19). This can be more simply conceived of as stress (20, 21) - here from the pandemic and
emergency-to-sustained remote teaching in addition to health and safety challenges to educators and students.
Responses can include the strategies, solutions, and behaviors of individual educators to these stressors.
Finally, adaptations are the potential population or society-level institutional strategies that collectively
evolved throughout this crisis in schools or universities to address the stress and challenges of pandemic
teaching at scale. This model can be applied to the contemporary and ground-breaking research in education
to explore the hypothesis that educators are high-performers and functionally elevated their performance
under duress to serve the public in the last 16-18 months. The implication of this approach is that we can
learn from educational research right now to inform and develop more resilient and long-term strategies for
both conventional and remote teaching in future.
The extent of published, peer-reviewed research associated with the COID-19 pandemic is nothing short
of staggering. Conservative queries for key terms in Google Scholar and The Web of Science returned over
200,000 papers from the start of 2020 to now (explored June 2021). This does not include archived preprints.
It has been estimated that ~137 papers per day were published on COVID-19 since February 2020 (22).
Productivity rates in academia vary based on discipline and topic specificity, but this volume and rate of
research publication is likely an order of magnitude greater than precedents for most if not all other previous
human endeavors shared in journals (23, 24). Terms directly associated with teaching and education were
scoped, and at least 2154 papers have been published (Table 1). In academic research, it is not uncommon for
scientific synthesis papers such as reviews, systematic-reviews, and meta-analyses to aggregate and compile
findings from individual, primary studies to explore larger, consistent patterns in research when sufficient
evidence has accumulated (25, 26). More research is not necessarily ideal or critical for discovery, but this

corpus of work does provide a needed opportunity to examine the responses of educators to the pandemic
through scientific synthesis. Introspection of collective work at key points can also lead to novel directions of
research and identify gaps.
Review of syntheses
A set of queries were first scoped using The Web of Science bibliometrics engine to explore and aggregate the
peer-reviewed, indexed research from 2020 to June 2021 on education and the pandemic (27). The number of
meta-analyses, reviews, and systematic reviews totaled 99 instances (Table 1). These synthesis, higher-order
studies were then reviewed for relevance to education and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, and all
remaining studies were classified using the effect-response-adaptation model proposed above. Adaptation or
institutional and organization-level strategies comprised the least significantly synthesized form of COVID-19
pandemic education research followed by pandemic effects on educators (Figure 1). The response of educators
to the pandemic in their teaching was the most studied comprising 57% of all studies. A total of 7039
individuals were collectively summarized in these studies.
A more detailed analysis was applied to the response literature using the R programming language (28)
on the text and tabular frequencies, and when reported, quantitative estimates. The relative frequency of
teaching responses by individual educators were summarized (Figure 2). A total of 11 distinct generalized
responses were reported in the synthesis literature, and the mean success rate describes the frequency that
these interventions or strategies were implemented during the pandemic (Figure 2). Success was defined in
terms of frequency of study and application by educators, i.e. the sign of positive and negative reciprocal
effects on students was not summarized in these syntheses. These findings do strongly suggest that some
strategies with relatively higher frequencies, i.e. arbitrarily greater than 50% of the time for instance, were
amenable to future introspection, innovation, and potentially reflect efficacy estimates for emergency and
remote instruction. In a perfunctory analysis to examine high-level trends, these relative occurrence data
were used to calculate a weighted-effect size estimate using the escalc function in the metafor package in R
(29). The proportion of strategies implemented by educators were thus converted to incidence rates weighted
by the relative sample sizes, i.e. an intervention tried 50% of the time with a small class for a few students
is not weighted equivalently to a study tried with several hundred individuals. The mean incidence effect
sizes were effective and positive (Random-effects meta-analysis, Chi-square value = 1.69, p = 0.0001) whilst
the various strategies reported significantly differed from one another (Random-effects meta-analysis with
strategy as moderator, F value = 2.86, p = 0.008). Similar to the raw implementation success rate data,
teaching strategy and instruction emerged as frequent response mechanisms used by educators during the
pandemic.
Implications
The conceptual model of effect-response-adaptation successfully described and classified the corpus of
peer-reviewed, indexed research literature published on education during the COVID-19 pandemic to date.
Response by educators was frequently examined, and these findings strongly suggest that virtually every
single component of remote, distributed learning and educator performance expressed a deep and meaningful
change. In particular, the human factors in this crisis such as teaching strategies, instruction, and flexibility not the new technology nor novel technique strategies - were the most fluent and significantly diverged from
the previous educational norms suggesting a critical research gap in supporting e-learning and educators in
future can be better enabled by developments in these specific fields. Professional development, mindfulness
training, and efficacy also emerged as salient issues for innovation in the future of performance for educators
and institutions or schools that support instruction. A recent survey published responses of ~6000 teachers in
the USA strongly suggested that their sense of efficacy at the tail of the pandemic was significantly eroded
(30). This evidence underscores the importance of population, societal, and institutional-level adaptations
now desperately needed to reduce impacts on the sustained performance of educators. Individual responses
and routine teaching in adverse conditions, i.e. exceptional performance, can only get us so far, and as a
society, we must globally consider deep and novel investments in this form of human capital. Education
is a pillar of society that buttresses our collective wellbeing, and attention to the efficacy of educators as
responders to change in all contexts will provide resilience in remote and many other future teaching contexts.
