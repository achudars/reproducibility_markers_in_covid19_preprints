Abstract
This study offers an overview on changes in fertility plan during the COVID-19 crisis of a
representative sample of the young population (18-34) in Italy, France, Germany, Spain and UK. Data
were collected between March 27 and April 7, 2020. Our results show that fertility plans have been
negatively revised in all countries, but not in the same way. In Germany and France fertility plans
changed moderately, with many people still planning or postponing their decision to have a child
during the 2020. In Italy, instead, the proportion of abandoners is much higher than in other countries,
while comparatively it shows a lower proportion of those deciding to postpone their plans. Moreover,
the demographic characteristics of the individuals seem to be associated with fertility plans in
different ways across countries. In Italy, abandoners are common among individuals younger than 30
and those without a tertiary education. In Germany, abandoners are slightly more prevalent in the
regions most affected by the COVID-19. In UK, fertility plans have been most frequently abandoned
by individuals that expect the worse impact of the crisis on their future income. Finally, in France and
Spain we did not observe a clear pattern for revision of fertility plans. These results suggest that
different mechanisms are at work, due to the different economic, demographic and policy pre-crisis
background and post-crisis prospects. Low-fertility contexts, in particular, appear to be more at risk
of a fertility loss due to the crisis.

Introduction
Historically, economic crises have never been the preferred period for a couple to decide to have a
baby. The millions of jobs lost in that circumstances, even when a couple is not directly affected,
create a climate of great uncertainty, which depresses family projects (Adsera 2011, Goldstein et al.
2013, Matysiak et al. 2018). Therefore, we may expect the economic crisis due to the COVID-19
emergency to produce similar demographic outcomes. However, the fertility consequences of the
crisis are not expected to be equally distributed across countries. Demographic, as well as economic,
contextual features may support or further reduce individuals’ pre-crisis fertility plans, by reducing
(or not) the uncertainty derived by the negative economic trend (Adsera 2004, Kreyenfeld 2016,
Caltabiano et al. 2017, Vignoli et al. 2019). In Europe, the climate of uncertainty caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic might have been stressed by the still ongoing effect of the 2008 financial crisis,
especially in Southern European countries where young people and women’s employment indicators
and fertility rates are the lowest (Matysiak et al. 2018). Additionally, the physical distancing required
by the COVID-19 containment strategy imposed also restrictions to (physical) intergenerational
support and this might affect more strongly fertility plans in those countries, such as Italy and Spain,
where grandparental childcare is more intensive (Bordone et al, 2017; Price et al, 2018), also due to
a lower availability of childcare services.
One of the distinctive characteristics of this economic crisis compared to others has been the clear
perception of its huge impact on everyday life since the first days of the lockdown, but also on the
constraints and opportunities of one's life choices. This means that, since the very beginning, people
had the perception that things would have been changing, and that many of their future life plans
needed to be revised accordingly. The aim of this study is to investigate the very first effect of the
crisis on young people fertility plans compared to their pre-emergency plans, by comparing European
countries among them (i.e. Italy, France, Germany, Spain and UK), and within them by comparing
groups based on key socio-demographic characteristics, i.e. age, education, expectations on future
income, residence in a region with high rate of COVID-19 cases.
Data and method
We use data from the survey “Rapporto Giovani” carried out by Istituto Giuseppe Toniolo and IPSOS.
As far as we know, this is the first international survey on the COVID-19 impact on young generations
fertility plans. It has been conducted between March 27-31, 2020 in Italy and April 2-7, 2020 in the
other countries. Interviews were conducted using CAWI (Computer Assisted Web Interviewing)
2

administered questionnaire on a representative sample - at the country level - of the young population
(18-34 years old individuals; 6000 respondents overall). The individuals were chosen with a quota
sampling technique: the representativeness is given by a significant set of different variables (gender,
age, geographical origin, education, marital status, etc.) on which the quotas sample have been
defined (more information available at: https://www.rapportogiovani.it/osservatorio/). Respondents
answered to a question about their fertility plans at the beginning of the 2020 (before the start of the
COVID-19 emergency). A further question on their fertility plans at the time of interview has been
asked only to those who answered to have had some intention to conceive a child during the 2020. In
particular, this last question asks: “Did the coronavirus emergency interfere in any way with this
program?” with three possible answers: [1] “No, the program remains confirmed for 2020” (“still
planners”); [2] “The program remains confirmed but I had to postpone it” (“postponers”); [3] “For
now I have quitted the program (“abandoners”)”, from which we derived three possible groups of
respondents.
We accounted for heterogeneities in fertility plans by gender, age (18-24, 25-29; 30-34), education
(tertiary vs lower); expectations about future income and living in a region strongly hit by the COVID19 pandemic. More specifically, to account for the possible economic effect of the crisis, we
considered the individuals’ perceived uncertainty about their income. This is likely to be a projection
of both their occupational (in)security and the indirect expected effect of the crisis on the economic
system and labour market. The question is asked as “Thinking about your future, do you think the
current coronavirus emergency will have a positive or negative impact on your (personal) income?”
Answers were given on a scale from 1 (much negative) to 5 (much positive). The variable has been
dichotomized, taking value 0 if the respondent is not expecting any effect or a positive effect (values
3, 4 and 5), and value 1 if the respondent is expecting negative income shocks (values 1 and 2).
Finally, we considered a possible context effect due to living in a region which has been strongly
affected by the diffusion of COVID-19 cases. Data have been obtained at the regional level (NUTS2
or NUTS1 according to the available level of aggregation in the survey) in the period between the 9th
and the 14th of April 2020 (from https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/reuses/carte-de-levolution-du-covid-enfrance/, https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/#regions, https://github.com/open-covid-19/data#metadata).
We considered the cumulated number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per 1000 inhabitants. We
calculated the tertiles of the distribution of this indicator within each country, and we generated a
dummy variable for living in a region with high number of the COVID-19 cases (regions above the
third tertile).

3

We calculated the adjusted proportions (i.e., predicted probabilities) for the three alternative fertility
plans by using multinomial models and including one by one the socio-demographic variables of our
interest and controlling for gender. Because of the relatively low sample sizes, some clear trends in
our data did not result in statistically significant differences. When significant results are commented,
the corresponding p-value has been added in parentheses.
Results
Just few days after this survey has been conducted, the scenario about the COVID-19 was the one
described in Table 1. The country-level count of the number of positive cases gives a rough idea on
how the pandemic affects countries differently. The same table reports the distribution of other
indicators (previous to the pandemic) at the country-level and at the regional-level for regions with a
high number of COVID-19 cases (aggregated). Across countries, Italy and Spain show the worst
scenario in terms of both labour market and fertility indicators. Generally, the regions most affected
by the COVID-19 are those where women and young people show (on average) better conditions in
the labour market compared to the country average. For fertility indicators, only for Italy and Spain
we can observe a higher fertility rate in the most affected regions compared to the country average.
The proportion of individuals who were planning in January to conceive a child during the 2020 is
roughly the same across countries, but slightly higher in Italy and France (26.6% and 27.5%
respectively) than in Germany, Spain and UK (respectively 21.4%, 21.6% and 23.6%). However, the
consequences of the crisis seem unequal across them. Three alternative patterns appear from our data
(Table 1). First, there are countries where the impact seems to be (relatively) less dramatic: in France
and Germany the emergency has produced a quite high number of postponers, but a relatively small
number of abandoners; more than the 30% of the plans are still ongoing. The second is observed for
Spain and UK, where still-planners are about 20% (less than in France and Germany), but most of
the others are more prone to postpone than to abandon (even though in Spain the proportion of
abandoners is 10 percentage points higher than in UK). Finally, in Italy the percentage of stillplanners is in between the two previous groups, but with an equally high proportion of postponers
and abandoners. In particular, the prevalence of abandoners in Italy is substantially higher than in the
other countries.

Fertility plans have not changed in the same way across age groups both within and between countries
(Figure 1). A common cross-country tendency is represented by the increasing proportion of stillplanners with age, which is higher among individuals aged 25-29 and 30-34, as compared to their
younger counterpart (18-24).

Given that a high proportion of individuals aged 18-24 in our sample is still enrolled in
school/university, we restricted the sample to individuals aged 25-34 to examine the role of education.
More specifically, we explored whether having a higher education might be protective with respect
to the pre-crisis fertility plans (Figure 2). Higher education might be associated with a higher socioeconomic status: this might reduce the uncertainty derived by the economic crisis. A positive
tendency appears only for Italy (p-value: 0.045) and UK, where having a tertiary degree is associated
with a higher prevalence of still-planners, while a lower prevalence of abandoners (only in the Italian
case). In Spain, having a tertiary education is associated with a higher proportion of postponers
compared to those who do not have an academic degree, while in Germany (p-value: 0.024) and
France with a slightly higher proportion abandoners. Across countries, it seems that having a tertiary
6

education tends to level off the probability of abandoning the original fertility plans, while among
lower educated great cross-country differences exist.

The more individuals expect their income in the future to be insecure due to the current economic
crisis, the greater might be the probability that their fertility plans will change. This tendency appears
in our data for UK (p-value: 0.063). In these cases, in fact, those perceiving their personal income as
at risk show a lower propensity to be still planning a child, a higher proportion of postponers in Spain
and of abandoners in Italy and UK.

Finally, those living in regions characterized by high diffusion of the COVID-19 seems to change
their fertility plans only in Germany (p-value: 0.076), France and UK (p-value: 0.092). In these
countries, in fact, in “red” regions as compared to the others, we observe a lower proportion of still
planners and in Germany a higher proportion of abandoners, while this is not the case in Spain and
Italy, where the pattern seems to be reversed (Figure 4).

Discussion
Our study provides evidence of how fertility plans of young people in five European countries have
changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Differences arise between and within countries according
to the socio-demographic characteristics of the individuals. In countries where the previous economic
and labour market situation was more positive (i.e. Germany and France) the proportion of those
abandoning the fertility plans for 2020 is much lower than in the other countries; these countries,
instead, show the highest proportion of people still planning a child for the 2020. On the contrary, in
Southern European countries, and more dramatically in Italy (the first country affected by the
pandemic and with a more strict lockdown), people are more often abandoning – and not simply
postponing – their pre-crisis fertility plans.
The only recurrent result within countries is the “protective” effect of age in maintaining the original
fertility plans. A possible explanations can be the fact that those in their 30s - and especially women
- are more prone to preserve their pre-crisis fertility plans at least at the beginning of the crisis
9

(Sobotka et al. 2011), which seems to be consistent with the lower tendency to postpone the decision
among those who are 30-34 compared to the other two groups. In Italy also the tendency to abandon
is lower for the oldest, while in the other countries there are no differences with the group 25-29. This
very unique path might be due to higher mother’s age at first birth in Italy compared to the other
countries; thus, among those who are 30-34, childlessness may be more prevalent in Italy than in
other countries (Sobotka and Beaujouan 2018). As shown by previous research, at least in Italy the
Great Recession did not change the propensity to have the first child for women in their last years of
the reproductive period (Caltabiano et al. 2017), while at younger ages (below 30) fertility has been
more affected (Goldstein et al. 2013).
The economic uncertainty derived by the crisis is not instead clearly associated with a higher
probability to abandon or postpone fertility plans within countries, except in the case of UK. In this
case, in fact, those perceiving higher income related risk from this crisis have the same probability to
abandon their original fertility plans as in Spain and Italy. The fact that UK is the only country in the
sample with a liberal welfare state – i.e. where policy measures to protect the personal income are
less developed than in other types of welfare states – might explain why expectations on personal
income are so relevant in determining fertility decision.
Even the prevalence of COVID-19 cases in the region does not suggest a consistent path of association
with the change in fertility expectation across countries. Only in Germany, France and UK, the “red”
regions show a higher prevalence of abandoners or postponers. In Italy and Spain for example, the
probability to abandon is lower in the regions most affected by the pandemic. In these cases, at least,
the most affected regions are also among the most economically performant of the country, and those
with a fertility rate higher than the country average.
Our results suggest that the possible effect of the COVID-19 epidemic and the subsequent economic
crisis cannot be merely interpreted under the same mechanisms in all European countries. Previous
economic and demographic conditions (as arguably the type of welfare state), at least in part inherited
by the Great Recession, seem to shape the fertility plans of the young population across countries.
