Older and ‘staying at home’ during lockdown: informal care receipt during the
COVID-19 pandemic amongst people aged 70 and over in the UK
Maria Evandrou1,2, Jane Falkingham1, Min Qin1 and Athina Vlachantoni1,2
Abstract
On 23 March 2020 the UK went into lockdown in an unprecedented step to attempt to limit
the spread of coronavirus. Government advice at that time was that all older people aged 70
and over should stay at home and avoid any contact with non-household members. This study
uses new data from the Understanding Society COVID 19 survey collected in April 2020,
linked to Understanding Society Wave 9 data collected in 2018/19, in order to examine the
extent of support received by individuals aged 70 and over in the first four weeks of
lockdown from family, neighbours or friends not living in the same household, and how that
support had changed prior to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. The research
distinguishes between different types of households as, given with guidance not to leave
home and not to let others into the household, those older people living alone or living only
with a partner also aged 70 and above are more likely to be particularly vulnerable. The
results highlight both positive news alongside causes for concern. The receipt of assistance
with Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs), especially shopping, has increased
particularly among those living alone or with an older partner, reflecting the rise of
volunteering and community action during this period. However, not all older people reported
a rise, and the majority reported ‘no change’, in the support received. Moreover, amongst
those older people reporting that they required support with at least one Activity of Daily
Living (ADL) task prior to the pandemic, around one-quarter reported receiving no care from
outside the household and one-in-ten of those with two or more ADL care needs reported
receiving less help than previously. Although formal home care visits have continued during
the pandemic to those who have been assessed by the local government to be in need, it is
important to acknowledge that some older people risk not having the support they need.

Older and ‘staying at home’ during lockdown: informal care receipt during the
COVID-19 pandemic amongst people aged 70 and over in the UK

Background
Since December 2019 a new coronavirus has emerged, resulting in a global pandemic. At the
time of writing (June 2020), there have been more than 8.5 million acute respiratory
syndrome (COVID-19) cases recorded, with 460,000 deaths in 188 countries (Johns Hopkins
University, 2020). The epidemic has led to a range of public health actions being taken to
control the spread of the virus (Bavel et al., 2020). Amongst these, the single most critical
measure has been to foster a degree of physical distancing, reflecting the fact that the
coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets with the virus into the air.
On 23rd March 2020 the UK went into lockdown in an unprecedented attempt to limit the
spread of coronavirus, with the Government mandating all those who could, to work at home,
closing all but essential shops and advising the population to stay at home and limit contact
with other people outside their household. Individuals with specific medical conditions were
identified as clinically extremely vulnerable and strongly advised to stay at home at all times
and ‘shield’, avoiding all face-to-face contact. All older people aged 70 or older, regardless of
medical conditions, were deemed to be clinically vulnerable and advised to stay at home as
much as possible (Public Health England, 2020; Cabinet Office, 2020).
Lockdown has brought disruption to daily life for the whole population. Individuals aged 70
and over have, however, faced particular challenges in navigating how to secure food and
other essentials and manage their health and care needs without leaving their home (AgeUK,
2020). In the UK, as in other countries, the support received by older individuals living in the
community is provided from a range of sources, including informal sources such as one’s
family and friends, formal statutory sources such as the local council, or formal paid sources
such as a privately paid carer. Historically, family members have provided the majority of
informal care in later life, with much lower proportions of older people receiving regular help
from friends or neighbours (Vlachantoni et al., 2015; Maplethorpe et al., 2015). During the
COVID-19 pandemic, the printed press and media has cited many positive news stories
highlighting how communities have come together to provide support to those shielding or
isolating (e.g. BBC, 25th May 2020).
Meeting older people’s needs for social care is crucial for maintaining older people’s mental
and physical health, wellbeing and dignity (Allen et al., 2014). Compared with older adults
receiving adequate care, those reporting ‘unmet needs’ face greater challenges and
vulnerabilities associated with their daily living activities, including a higher risk of falls, and
a higher mortality rate (Komisar et al., 2005; Momtaz et al., 2012; He et al., 2015). In-depth
interviews with individuals uncovered that unmet need for care is also associated with poor
mental health and anxiety for some people, often associated with a sense of frustration and
the daily struggle to meet their basic needs (Ipsos MORI, 2017).

2

Whether older people with difficulties in daily living receive needed care has been found to
be determined by the type and level of an individual’s need, as well as their demographic,
socio-economic and health status characteristics (Vlachantoni et al. 2011). In the UK context,
according to Health Survey for England 2018 (Marcheselli and Ridout, 2019), 22 percent of
men and 31 percent of women aged 65 and over needed help with at least one Activity of
Daily Living 1 (ADL) and 20 percent of men and 32 percent of women respectively needed
help with at least one Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL). Many of these needs are
however ‘unmet’, meaning that individuals do not receive any support associated with a
particular need. From the same survey, it is reported that 19 percent of men and 28 percent of
women aged 65 and over had some unmet need for help with at least one ADL, and 12
percent and 15 percent respectively had an unmet need for help with at least one IADL (ibid).
The study found that the living arrangements of older people matter, with those living alone
being more vulnerable to not receiving the care needed compared to cohabiting individuals
(Löfqvist et al. 2016; Ipsos MORI, 2017).
Other research (Vlachantoni et al., 2015; Marcheselli and Ridout, 2019) highlights that
receipt of support among older people increases with age. Care needs and receipt of help also
vary according to household income, with those in the lowest income tertile both reporting
the greatest need and the highest proportions receiving help. The number of IADLs an older
person reports having difficulty with, followed by the number of ADLs, are the strongest
determinants of receiving support from any source (Vlachantoni et al., 2015). Older people
reporting poor health were most likely to report that they received care. Furthermore,
different kinds of impediments in everyday life are associated with receiving support from
different sources (Ibid).
It is important to note that social care needs and the likelihood of receiving assistance with
such needs are not static but dynamic, and can shift as a result of the conditions through
which the older person has lived, the challenges they have faced, and the resources available
to them (Godfrey and Callaghan, 2000). The COVID-19 pandemic and the strict rules of
staying at home are likely to have a significant impact on such dynamics, raising important
policy concerns about the provision of social care to those who need it the most. This study
aims to examine the extent of support received by individuals aged 70 and over from family,
neighbours or friends not co-residing in the same household in the first four weeks of the
COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, and how that support changed compared to prior to the
outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. The research distinguishes between different types of
households, as those older people living alone, or living with a partner also aged 70 plus,
might be thought to be particularly vulnerable, with the entire household having been advised
to ‘stay at home’.

Activities of daily living (ADLs) include everyday tasks generally involving functional mobility and personal
care, such as bathing, dressing, toileting, and eating. Instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) include
those life functions necessary for maintaining a person's immediate environment e.g. shopping, cooking,
laundering, housecleaning, gardening.

Data and methods
This study uses data drawn from the first wave of Understanding Society COVID-19 Study,
conducted in April 2020 (University of Essex, 2020). Fieldwork was completed on 29th April
and thus covers the first month of lockdown. The data are linked to Wave 9 of Understanding
Society conducted in 2018/19, providing information about the respondents prior to the
outbreak of the pandemic. The analytical sample used here is restricted to all respondents
aged 70 and over, constituting a sample size of 2,597. The characteristics of the sample are
shown in Table 1 2.
The key outcome variables include whether the respondent has received care in the last four
weeks, as well as perceived changes in receiving such care as compared with the situation
prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The specific question wording is presented in the text box
below.

Respondents were able to provide more than one answer to the question on how help and
support has changed, as the answer codes are not mutually exclusive. The majority of
respondents selected only one answer. However, amongst all the respondents aged 70 and
over, 44 reported that they had received more help from some people who previously helped
and also received support from family, friends or neighbours who did not previously help;
and seven respondents reported receiving less help from some people who previously helped
but had also received support from family, friends or neighbours who did not previously help.

Women seem slightly underrepresented among the total population aged 70 and above in the Understanding
Society: COVID-19 Study, compared to the Understanding Society Wave 9, where women were accounting for
54.4%, and the mean age of both sexes was 77.6 (SD=6.2).

4

Therefore, in the following analysis we have treated each specific change as an individual
outcome variable; coded '1' if reporting this change and '0' otherwise.
A range of explanatory variables are of interest, capturing different dimensions of ‘need’.
The first of these is the type of household, with four categories: living in a single household,
only with a partner aged 70 and over, only with a partner aged under 70 years, and living with
an adult or others. Given the advice to ‘stay at home’, households containing only individuals
aged 70 and over may be postulated to have a greater need for support for activities such as
shopping.
In order to capture ‘needs’ unrelated to the pandemic itself and the associated lockdown, we
have also included information on difficulties performing ADLs and IADLs as reported in
Wave 9, collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 2,528 respondents aged 70
and over had full information in both Wave 9 and the COVID-19 module. An individual’s
difficulty in performing an activity reflected either only being able to perform that activity
with help from someone else or not being able to manage at all. Twenty-two percent of
respondents with complete information reported difficulty with at least one ADL. This
included difficulty in managing stairs (3.6%), getting around the house (0.9%), getting in/out
of bed (0.9%), cutting one’s toenails (17.8%), bathing/showering (2.1%), using the toilet
(including getting up and down) (0.7%), eating (including cutting up food) (0.8%), washing
one’s face and hands (0.5%), getting dressed and undressed (2.8%), and taking the right
amount of medicines at the right times (5.8%). In terms of difficulties in performing IADLs,
17.7 percent of respondents aged 70 plus reported difficulties with at least one IADL. This
included doing the shopping (9.6%), housework or laundry (9.1%), paperwork or pay bills
(8.9%), and walking down the road (5.0%).
Other control variables include the respondents’ demographic characteristics, for example
their age, sex, and ethnicity, housing tenure and whether the respondent reports any current
chronic health conditions.
Results
Receipt of support from family, neighbours or friends in the past four weeks
Amongst respondents aged 70 and over, two-thirds (66.7%) reported that they had received
support from family, neighbours or friends who did not live in the same house during the last
4 weeks (Table 2). A higher proportion of older women (70.1%) than men (63.3%) received
care from outside the household. Not surprisingly there was also a gradient by age, with
three-quarters of those in the oldest age group (aged 80 and over) reporting having received
help and support in the last 4 weeks, but there was no significant difference by ethnicity.
The proportion of respondents receiving care varied according to the type of household
(p<0.001), with four in five (80.1%) of those older people living alone reporting having
received support, and 70.0% among those living only with a partner aged 70 plus. This fell to
just over half of those living with a partner younger than 70 years old (53.7%) and those
living with other (51.5%). Although this paints a positive picture, it nevertheless illustrates
5

that one in five people aged 70 and over living alone did not receive any support from
informal sources (Figure 1).

Turning to look at how this varied according to physical need, there is a clear association
between difficulties in performing activities of daily living and receipt of support, with those
respondents who reported difficulties in performing two or more ADLs or IADLs prior to the
pandemic, being much more likely to receive help than those with no such difficulties (Figure
2).

Table A1 in the appendix provides further insight, presenting information on the receipt of
help and support by reporting of difficulty with ADLs and IADLs within each household
type. Amongst those older people aged 70 and over reporting difficulty with two or more
IADLs, 94.4% of those living alone received support from outside the household, compared
to 88% of those living with a partner also aged 70 and over (who technically should also be
shielding), 69.2% of those living with a partner aged under 70 and just 44.4% of those living
with other adults. Thus, it appears that those ‘most in need’, i.e. living alone and with ‘need’,
were most likely to receive help with instrumental activities of daily living. However, 17% of
those older people living alone who reported two or more difficulties with personal care
tasks, i.e. with ADLs, did not receive any external informal assistance, pointing to potential
unmet need for such tasks.
This is borne out by examining the type of care provided. Of those 1,685 respondents
receiving support from family, friends and neighbours outside the household, assistance with
shopping (including going to the shop or ordering an online delivery) was by far the most
common task, experienced by over nine out of ten older people (91.2%). This contrasts
sharply with the pre-COVID situation where just 9% of the respondents reported that they
needed assistance with this IADL. Around one-in-ten older people receiving support reported
assistance with online or internet access (10.6%), cooked meals (9.6%), decorating,
gardening or house repairs (9.0%). Many fewer respondents reported receiving support for
more personal tasks such as washing, ironing or cleaning (6.8%) and dealing with personal
affairs, such as paying bills and writing letters (4.5%). Just 1.1% reported receiving help with
basic personal needs like dressing, eating or bathing; tasks which involve individuals
accessing the respondents’ home.
Some types of help received during the pandemic differed according to the type of household,
with those living alone being more likely than the average to report having received cooked
meals (15.6%), support with decorating, gardening or house repairs (13.9%), assistance with
online or internet access (15.4%), and support for dealing with personal affairs (7.5%).
The main sources of care were adult children, including in-laws (67.7%), neighbours
(37.0%), friends (20.1%), non-co-residential spouse or partner (8.4%) and siblings (7.6%).
The distribution of caregivers was different according to the type of household. The
proportion of adult children, including in-laws, reported as the caregivers was the highest
among older people living only with a partner aged 70 and over (72.3%) and the lowest
among older people living alone (60.6%) (see appendix Table A2). There was no difference
in the proportion receiving care from neighbours and friends between different household
types.
Changes in receipt of care from family, neighbours or friends since the COVID-19
pandemic
When asked to compare their current help and support with that received prior to the outbreak
of the coronavirus pandemic, just over a quarter of respondents aged 70 and over (27%)
reported receiving help from family, friends or neighbours who did not previously provide
help and just under a fifth (17.7%) reported receiving more help from some people who
7

previously helped; only a small minority (4.1%) reported receiving less help; and around a
half (51%) reported no change in care receipt (Table 2). Once more, there were significant
differences by household type.

Older people living alone or only with a partner aged 70 and over were more likely to report
receiving support from family, friends or neighbours who did not previously help, or
receiving more help from someone people who previously helped. It should also be noted,
however, that older people living alone were also most likely to report receiving less help
than that of those from other households. More worryingly, one-in-ten of those who reported
two or more difficulties in performing ADLs prior to the pandemic reported receiving less
help.
The results discussed so far have explored associations between characteristics individually.
Results from the multivariate analysis (Table 3) confirm that individuals living alone or only
with a partner aged 70 and over, were more likely to receive care from outside the house, as
were those aged 80+, with at least one chronic condition, and women. Living alone and
having at least one chronic condition was also associated with being more likely to receive
more help from some people who previously helped. Household type was not however
statistically significantly associated with the receipt of help from a new source.
Interestingly the only group which was likely to receive less help were those older people
who reported difficulty with two or more IADLs prior to the pandemic. There was also an
elevated odds ratio of receiving less help amongst those older people with two or more
difficulties in performing ADLs, although this was not statistically significant due to a low
sample size. Nevertheless, it is indicative that there may be a small but vulnerable group
of incapacitated older people whose needs for daily living are not being met during the
pandemic. Amongst the 511 respondents who had reported difficulty in performing at least

8

one ADL prior to the pandemic, just 7 respondents reported receiving help with basic
personal needs like dressing, eating or bathing during the first 4 weeks of the lockdown.
Discussion and Conclusion
This paper provides the first insight into the receipt of help and support amongst older people
aged 70 and over during the first 4 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown when this
group had been explicitly advised to stay at home and minimise contact with others. We
contrast elderly couples where both are over 70 and compare these with couples where one is
aged under 70 years and thus not classified as clinically vulnerable unless they have other
underlying conditions. This help us to understand how ‘extreme social distancing’ has
impacted upon the health and well-being of older people.
The good news is that these research results indicate that the majority of older people
received support from the broad community. Apart from families living outside the house,
neighbours and friends have played an essential role in providing support to this vulnerable
group. Since the pandemic, a significant proportion of older people received an increased
level of help from existing caregivers or received support from new caregivers. This was
especially the case amongst those living alone or with a partner aged 70 and over. However,
there is also evidence that older people with difficulties in performing key activities of daily
living, faced a higher risk of receiving less care and support during the lockdown, raising the
spectre that some older people are not receiving adequate social care.
One of the features of the Government advice to tackle COVID-19 has been the use of the
age cut-off of 70 years and over to define those who may be clinically vulnerable and
therefore need to take extra precautions including ‘shielding’ at home. For those who live
alone, this has presented additional challenges around undertaking IADLs, such as shopping
and taking physical exercise. The research here indicates that assistance with such tasks
seems to have increased, reflecting the rise of volunteering and community action during this
period (Booth, 2020; Local Government Association, 2020; Van Bavel et al. 2020), although
not all older people living alone reported a rise and the majority reported ‘no change’.
However, the fact that this group have been asked to isolate also means that the need for help
with basic personal needs is more likely to go unmet as the advice has been not to allow
people from outside the household into your home. Our results seem to confirm this. The
social policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic needs to pay explicit attention to older
people who have difficulties with multiple IADL and ADLs in order to ensure that their
needs are being met. Previous research has shown that statutory social services are being
increasingly concentrated on those with the highest level of need (Vlachantoni, 2019). There
is a danger that during the pandemic those older people with more moderate needs may slip
under the radar of the formal safety net, and with informal carers unable to fulfil these needs,
unmet need may rise, resulting in a heightened risk of falls and other unanticipated visits to
hospital A&E.
This paper provides an important first contribution to our understanding of the dynamic of
social care receipt from the community during the COVID-19 pandemic amongst individuals
with major vulnerabilities. The authors acknowledge that this paper has the following
9

limitations which should be taken into account. Firstly, given the data constraint, the need for
care associated with ADLs and IADLs is not measured contemporaneously but rather inferred
from previous reports. It may be that someone who reported difficulty with an ADL in 2019
had recovered, whilst another older person who previously did not report a difficulty, now
does. It may be the case that some individuals not receiving care do so because they no longer
require it. It would strengthen the understanding of the extent of unmet need if future rounds
of the COVID-19 module study collected information on ADLs and IADLs. Secondly, it is
not possible to link the type of carer, for example the adult child or neighbour etc with the
provision of assistance with specific tasks. Previous research has shown that formal support
tends to be used for more basic and personal tasks, while informal support tends to be used
for more instrumental tasks (Vlachantoni et al., 2015). Including such information would
help us better understand ‘who helps with what tasks’ and thus which care needs remain
unmet and how these can be best addressed – informing policy debate.
