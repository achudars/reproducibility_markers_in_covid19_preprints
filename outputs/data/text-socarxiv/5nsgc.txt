Abstract
The spread of COVID-19 has prompted governments to implement a range of restrictions to public life and the economy (broadly, “lockdown policies”). We evaluate the shortand medium-term impacts of lockdown policies on civic attitudes relevant for the health
of democracy. Using survey data collected daily between March and May 2020 in the
United States and four European countries from 27,317 respondents and a difference-indifferences design, we document that lockdown policies give rise to authoritarian values
and, to a lesser degree, support for autocracy. We find little evidence that lockdown policies affect satisfaction with democracy and the government, out-group hostility, and generalized trust. Additional analyses reveal that the effects on authoritarianism and support
for autocracy persist for at least seven weeks, that the lifting of lockdown policies does not
have a countervailing effect away from authoritarianism and support for autocracy, and that
economic support packages have limited ability to alleviate the negative consequences of
lockdowns on civic attitudes. Together, these findings confirm the existence of lockdowns’
political repercussions, but show the need for a nuanced assessment of their scope. We
discuss the implications of our findings for how governments might need to accompany
lockdowns with measures that strengthen civic culture.

The COVID-19 pandemic has quickly become the largest public health crisis in living memory for countries across the globe. Governments’ priority has been to contain and slow the
spread of COVID-19 through the implementation of a range of lockdown measures that are
extraordinary, at least for democratic countries. While recent evidence points to the effectiveness of lockdown measures in decreasing COVID-19-related infections and deaths [2, 19], these
restrictive policies also have the potential to exacerbate the economic [8], social [18], and psychological [26] ramifications of the pandemic.
These developments—the public health crisis, the economic recession, and the lockdown
measures—have the potential for major and lasting political repercussions. Already during the
first wave, newspapers, public intellectuals, and governments have voiced concerns that the
COVID-19 outbreak could trigger a democratic backslide, fuel the rise of populist leaders, and
foster authoritarian values and out-group hostility [12, 31, 24].
Evidence from past health crises confirm that these concerns are not unfounded. Research
documents that the Black Death pandemic (1346–1353) in Europe fueled antisemitism and the
persecution of Jewish minorities [27], that the 1918 influenza pandemic decreased generalized
trust in the US [1], that the 2014 Ebola outbreak triggered anti-immigrant attitudes [3] and an
analysis of several past epidemics finds negative effects on confidence and trust in the government [4].
This evidence from historical health crises is joined by a rapidly growing literature on the
political repercussions of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A sizeable number of surveys
document that support for democracy has been eroding [6, 9], while support for autocratic
rule, illiberal policies, and outgroup hostility have been increasing during the first wave of the
COVID-10 pandemic [11, 13]. Note, however, that several studies suggest that this skeptical
view of democracy is often joined by “rally ’round the flag effects” leading to higher support
for the incumbent government [17, 20, 35, 38, 40].
We contribute to this research on the general political consequences of COVID-19 by providing causal evidence on the specific impacts of lockdown policies. Understanding the repercussions of these policies is important because, for those citizens not directly affected by
COVID-19, lockdown policies are some of the most directly visible consequences of the pandemic. Furthermore, understanding the effects of lockdown policies matters because governments have control over their introduction and removal; in contrast, policymakers can only
indirectly influence COVID-19’s spread. Our design, described in more detail below, not only
estimates the effects of introducing lockdown policies, but allows us to examine whether their
2

effects dissipate after their removal, at least in the short- and medium-term. The effects of removals are relevant for both theoretical and policy reasons, yet have not been well covered in
the existing literature on COVID-19’s political repercussions.
Two inferential challenges stand in the way of estimating effects of lockdown policies. First,
to disentangle the effects of lockdown policies from those of COVID-19’s spread, researchers
need a credible control group of similar areas, ideally within the same country, with less stringent lockdown policies (or no lockdown at all). The few existing studies of the effects of lockdowns address this challenge by resorting to survey experiments that ask respondents to react
to hypothetical policy scenarios [11] or general-purpose surveys that were already in the field
at the onset of the pandemic, and which allow for before-and-after comparisons of real-world,
national-level policies using interrupted time-series model in a single country [35, 39] or panel
data models covering several countries [17].
The second inferential challenge to comprehensively assessing the political impact of lockdown policies is accessing a broad range of attitudinal measures—particularly those that past
research has identified as relevant for the health of democracy [5]. Ideally, these measures not
only cover satisfaction with and support for democracy as a form of government (two questions
covered by some general-purpose surveys) but also attitudinal foundations of civic culture, including authoritarian values, generalized trust, and out-group hostility.
Our tailored survey allows us to overcome both inferential challenges. To leverage subnational variation in lockdown policies, we fielded cross-sectional surveys in France, Germany,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States every day for two months, from March
19, 2020, near the pandemic’s onset in Europe and the US, until May 19, 2020. During our field
period, we interviewed roughly 80 respondents per day and country, which provides us a sample
of 27,317 respondents in total. In selecting countries for our study, we prioritized the largest
countries in Europe as well as federal countries (e.g., Switzerland) with subnational variation
in lockdown policies. These daily interviews allow us to compare the attitudes of respondents
sampled from the same population before and after the introduction (and removal) of lockdown
measures while using similar respondents in other regions of the same country that introduced
(removed) lockdown policies later on as a control group.
Our survey enables us to overcome the second challenge and to comprehensively trace the
political effects of lockdown restrictions for three dimensions of support for democracy and
three dimensions of civic attitudes that are foundational for democracy. To capture regime support, we use a battery of standard questions to measure “diffuse” support for democracy as a
3

principle (as well as its main alternatives: autocracy, technocracy, and military rule) and “specific” support for how democracy works in practice [32]. We complement these with measures
that capture respondents’ satisfaction with and support for the incumbent government and parties.
We also measure three attitudes that existing research has identified as main pillars of the
civic culture that sustains democracy [5]. We measure right-wing authoritarianism using the
scale by [15]. To capture out-group hostility, we take the difference between the average feeling
thermometer score of the “native” in-group and the ethnic minority out-group [25]. Lastly, we
measure generalized trust, an essential lubricant for the functioning of societies and democratic
political institutions [34]. The Materials and Methods and SI section 1 provides further details
on the measures, their theoretical grounding, the wording of the survey questions, and their
aggregation using principal component analysis.
We combine these outcome data with information on the extent and timing of lockdown
policies. For each of the studied countries, we collected data on the announcement and implementation of the governments’ policies at the national and subnational level. Using these data,
we construct a six-point cumulative Lockdown Index (LI) that measures the strength of the restrictions setup by government on the federal and local level on a daily basis. This six-point
index considers forced closures of businesses, closures of schools and daycares, restrictions on
gatherings, and general “lockdown” or “stay-at-home” orders. A value of six corresponds to the
strict lockdown enforced in France, while a value of three would correspond to closed schools,
restrictions on events, and the ”safer-at-home” orders that some US states enacted (see SI 1.2
for details).

Results
Trends in Europe and The United States
Figure 1 shows the developments of our outcome measures and the Lockdown Index over the
study period. Over these two months, support for democratic principles among respondents in
the United States declined and support for authoritarianism increased. Among the European
respondents, support for democracy increased slightly while authoritarian values declined. Respondents’ satisfaction with how democracy functions in the United States increased between
March and April while it declined to some degree in Europe; government satisfaction followed

Figure 1: Estimates for survey items and scales between March 19 and May 19, 2020 for
respondents located in the United States and Europe. The lines describe the trend based on a
generalized additive regression with shrinkage cubic regression splines fitted on daily survey
estimates displayed as dots. To ease interpretation, estimates and trend lines are rescaled to
zero for March 19.
Are these trends shaped by how governments on the local and federal level respond to the
pandemic? While at the beginning of our field period, about an equal share of respondents in
the United States and Europe reported being affected by government restrictions, the shares
diverged considerably throughout the field period. The share of respondents in the US reporting
to be affected by restrictions grew substantially while it remained generally steady early on
5

and before dropping in Europe. The co-occurrence in trends in attitude and the exposure to
government tougher COVID-19 response policies suggests that the two are connected. We next
present evidence that there is, indeed, a causal relationship.

Effects of Lockdown Policies
To assess the effects of COVID-19-related lockdown policies, we take advantage of the staggered imposing and lifting of restrictions in the regions of the surveyed countries and compare responses before and after changes in restrictions. This approach follows a difference-indifferences (DID) design [10], estimating differences in outcomes between regions with varying
levels of restrictions net of any pre-existing differences between regions. We estimate effects
with the standard DID model specification of linear regression with fixed effects for regions and
days (see Materials and Methods for details).
To obtain a balanced panel of average survey outcomes across regions and days, we use
Bayesian multilevel modeling with post-stratification [23, 33]. Post-stratifying the data allows
us to address any imbalance in the panel resulting from the fact that due to random sampling, we
are not surveying respondents from all (small) regions every survey day, and to simultaneously
adjust for demographic differences between our sample and the population. See Materials and
Methods for details on the post-stratification procedure.
Figure 2 reports our main results. Beginning with panel (A), we find mixed evidence for
the effects of lockdown policies on the three scales measuring support for democracy. On the
political system scale, which captures preferences over regime types, we see that increasingly
severe lockdown policies raise support for autocracy (here and below, we report the posterior
poster probability p that the effect is smaller than zero: p < 0.02). The effect, however is
small: each additional point up the Lockdown Index (e.g., going from no restriction on event
size to limiting events to 10 or fewer people) leads to an increase in support for autocracy by
1% of a standard deviation. For both satisfaction with democracy and the government, we find,
on average, small positive effects—roughly 0.5% of standard deviation—but we cannot reliably
conclude that these effects are positive (p = 0.15 and 0.11, respectively). Together, these results
suggest that the restrictive measures introduced at the height of the first wave of the COVID-19
pandemic had only marginal effects on support for democracy.
We now turn to three measures of attitudes reflecting the health of a civic culture: authoritarianism, generalized trust, and hostility toward outgroups. The analysis reveals that increasingly

(N = 7, 254).
strict lockdown policies fuelled authoritarian attitudes. The estimates allow us to confidently
conclude that this effect is positive (p < 0.01) and substantively meaningful: the estimates suggest that going from no restrictions to a full lockdown, e.g., as occurred in France, increases
authoritarian values by 10.2% of a standard deviation. We do not find any reliable effects on the
other two measures of the attitudinal foundations of democracy. For both generalized trust and
relative outgroup hostility, the estimated effects of restrictive policies are centered at zero.
The final panel of Figure 2 presents the results of a manipulation check that supports the
validity of our difference-in-differences design. We estimate the effect of lockdown policies on
the rate at which citizens report that current government policies restrict their movement. If our
design works as intended, we would expect restrictive policies to have a strong positive effect
on this outcome. Such a pattern is already visible in the bottom row of Figure 1; our formal
estimate confirms this relationship. The analysis indicates that an additional restrictive policy
increases the share of citizens reporting a restriction by about 3.5 percentage points (p < 0.01).
Next, we consider the dynamics of lockdown policies’ impact on civic attitudes: How soon

7

after these policies were introduced did attitudes harden? When governments removed restrictions, did citizens subsequently decrease their support for autocratic government and their endorsement of authoritarian values? The analyses reported in Figure 3 shed light on these questions. These analyses recode our measure of lockdown policies into a binary variable and then
estimate the effects of restrictive policies in the days immediately before and after their introduction or removal.
For the political system scale (panel A), we see that 5 to 6 days prior to the introduction
of restrictions, there are no differences between regions that will and will not implement restrictions. Once the restrictions are introduced, attitudes only gradually shift towards autocracy,
peaking five days after policies are implemented and then staying at roughly that level afterwards. Shifting the focus to the effects of lifting lockdown policies, the analysis uncovers no
evidence that removing these restrictions led citizens to move back towards favoring democracy.
The results for authoritarianism tell a largely similar story, although there are two relevant
differences. First, we identify an anticipation effect of lockdown policies on the day before they
are announced, which likely result from reports of impending restrictions in the press. Second,
the effect on authoritarianism more resembles a one-time shift rather than a gradual change.
Turning to the effects of lifting lockdown policies, we find no evidence that removals led to a
decline in authoritarianism.
The supplementary materials provide several additional analyses and robustness tests. We
present effects separately for all of the survey items comprising our scales (Fig S.10) as well as
the main results fit to the raw survey data, i.e., without post-stratification (Fig S.11). We additionally show that the effects are robust to controlling for the daily number of COVID-19-related
deaths per region (Fig S.6). Complementing Figure 3, we further present these specifications
for our other outcome variables (Fig S.1) and also show overall effects of introductions (Fig
S.3) or reversals (Fig S.4) using the binary version of our restriction measure.

Discussion
Our results show that the introduction of restrictive policies increased authoritarianism and support for autocracy, but had few consequences for other civic attitudes. Together, they suggest
a concentrated impact of restrictive policies during the first wave of COVID-19 on attitudes
underpinning pluralistic and democratic societies: while we uncover a turn toward authoritarianism, this is not accompanied by scapegoating of out-groups, a loss of generalized trust, or
diminished satisfaction with government performance.
Our dynamic analysis in Figure 3 reveals important asymmetries in the effects of the introduction and lifting of lockdowns: governments’ decisions to implement lockdown measures

9

have deleterious effects for civic attitudes that are not simply remedied by their removal. To
explore whether these effects decay over longer periods of time, with or without removals, we
refit the “restriction introduction” models from Figure 3 to estimate the effects of policies on a
weekly basis for up to seven weeks post-lockdown. The results, shown in Fig S.9, indicate that
even seven weeks after the introduction of lockdowns, the effects on regime preferences and
authoritarianism persist. These persistent effects, combined with the fact that subsequent waves
of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to the reimposing of lockdowns, raise the specter of compounding effects that substantially erode some relevant domains of democratic civic culture.
In their efforts to fight the pandemic, governments often combined lockdown policies with
supportive measures to strengthen the economy and aid particularly affected business and workers. Can these supportive policies dampen the harmful effects of lockdown policies on civic
attitudes? To investigate this possibility, we augment our baseline DID models by interacting
lockdown stringency with a measure of the number of economic support packages announced
by the government (see SI section 1.2 for details on this measure). The results of this analysis,
shown in Figure S.7, provide little evidence that economic support packages dampen the effects
of lockdown policies on either the political system scale (one-sided interaction p = 0.31) or the
authoritarianism scale (one-sided interaction p = 0.34). Though targeted support packages are
important for lightening the economic burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, these results point to
the need for governments to consider other approaches to soften the repercussions of lockdown
policies on civic attitudes. We discuss this point in the concluding paragraph.

Conclusion
Our findings of immediate and, at least over the short- and medium-term, persistent effects of
lockdown policies on two domains of civic attitudes essential for the functioning of democracy—
authoritarian values and support for non-democratic forms of government—establish empirical
foundations for concerns voiced by commentators and governments about the possible political
repercussions of the pandemic [12, 31, 24]. Yet, our findings do not paint an entirely bleak
picture, since other important correlates of a healthy civic culture—from evaluations of government performance to generalized trust and out-group hostility—were not eroded by lockdown
policies during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the effect we find on
preferences for non-democratic regimes is small in magnitude.
While these mixed findings require a nuanced assessment of the political repercussions of
10

lockdown policies so far, they warn that the pandemic has the potential to catalyze the receding
public support for democracy in Europe and the United States [22]. Our study serves as a
reminder that, in the face of the twin threats of public health and economic crises, support
for liberal democracy is not inevitable and cannot be taken for granted—even in consolidated
democracies [36].
In the public and scholarly debate surrounding the effectiveness and drawbacks of lockdown
policies, the trade-off between the economy and public health has been extensively discussed
[2, 8]. Our study points to separate collateral damage inflicted by extensive lockdown policies
that, to date, has received little attention: the erosion of liberal democracy. While its harder
to quantify the costs of an eroding civic culture vis-a-vis, for example, GDP output loss, the
potential long-term consequences are no less concerning. These concerns grow even larger in
light of our finding that government aid distributed to particularly affected industries and workers seems ineffective in reducing the political repercussions of lockdown policies documented
here.
Given the strong evidence on the effectiveness of lockdown measures in containing the
spread of COVID-19 (see, e.g., [19]), the lesson for policy-makers from our study is, of course,
not to prematurely lift measures for concerns about eroding civic attitudes. Instead, our findings
point to the importance of coupling restrictive policies with measures that counteract the rise in
authoritarian values and support for autocracy in liberal democracies. In addition to more longterm measures shown to strengthen civic culture such as civic education programs for students
[28, 29] and adults [16, 21], accompanying lockdown measures with public communication
about the evidence base, purpose and timing of the various restrictions [14] might be particularly
effective in mitigating some of the negative repercussions documented here. We hope that our
study can sound a clarion call for more research into actionable and scalable interventions that
effectively strengthen civic attitudes in the post-COVID world.

Materials and Methods
Survey data collection
To measure how public attitudes shift in response to governmental policies, we fielded daily
surveys in France, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. In Europe, we use the Respondi online panel while we recruited respondents from Amazon MTurk
11

in the US. In total, we surveyed 27,317 adult respondents with about 90-100 respondents daily
per country. Median completion time for our survey was about 5 minutes. In addition to sociodemographic characteristics including age, sex and place of residence, we collected information
on the outcome measures described below.

Outcome measures
We collected information on the following six dimensions of civic attitudes. First, we measure
two dimensions of support for democracy [30]: support for democracy as a principle, i.e., diffuse support, and satisfaction with how democracy works in practice and with the government,
i.e., specific support. We build our measure of diffuse support for democracy on [32] and ask respondents to indicate their preferences on a 4-point scale over four political regimes: autocracy,
technocracy, military rule, and democracy. We aggregate these survey questions into a single
scale using polychoric principal component analysis (PCA); we also apply PCA to all other
outcomes discussed below. To measure respondents’ satisfaction with how democracy works,
we use a direct, standard 4-point question as well as respondents’ intentions to turnout in the
next general election, treating the intention to engage with democracy as implicit approval of it
as a system of government[22]. Attitudes towards the incumbent government are elicited using
a direct question about respondents’ satisfaction with the government as well as respondents’
intention to support the incumbent parties or candidate in the next general election.
We supplement these measures of support for democracy with three civic attitudes that extant research has identified as relevant foundations [5]. First, we use the scale developed by
[15] to measure two facets of authoritarianism: authoritarian aggression and authoritarian submission. The view that authoritarianism impedes a democratic culture goes back to Altemeyer,
who contends that people scoring high on authoritarianism are ”easily frightened, which makes
them vulnerable to precisely the kind of overstated, emotional, and dangerous assertions a demagogue would make” [7, p. 101]. Second, to measure out-group hostility, we adapt standard
feeling thermometer questions [25], and take the difference between the feeling thermometer
toward co-citizen (in-group) and the average feeling thermometer toward three immigrant outgroups differing in their origin and cultural distance. Among these out-groups, we deliberately
choose origins that were not directly connected to the COVID-19’s origin, as our intent was
to not to measure scapegoating of a particular group that politicians or the media may tie to
the pandemic, but rather, more generalized hostility towards outsiders that was unrelated to

12

COVID-19’s spread. The third element of civic culture that we capture is generalized trust.
Extant research has documented the importance of generalized trust for the functioning of societies, economics and political institutions [34, 37]. We measure this concept with standard
generalized-trust survey item and feeling thermometer ratings of co-citizens.

Data on government policies
We collected information on national and regional government policies restricting citizens’ behavior from official government websites covering the two-month study period in the five surveyed countries. Based on this information, we construct a six-point Lockdown Index. For each
of the following three policies in place, we added one to the score: closures of non-essential
shops and non-take-out service at bars and restaurants; closures of schools and/or daycares; forbidding of public and private events of 50 people or more. If there is a recommendation to stay
at home and/or shelter in place, we also added one. If these is an order to stay at home and/or
shelter in place but if that order has several exceptions for essential activities, we added two.
Finally, if there is a stay at home and/or shelter in place order with only very limited exceptions
and/or strong enforcement, we added three. We use the same coding when it comes to government policies reversing previous restrictions but instead of adding the value, we subtract it from
the index. The final index encodes the strength of national and regional government restrictions
in each region and each day during our study period.

Multilevel regression and post-stratification
During our field period, we interviewed about 90-100 respondents per day and country. While
this approach provided us valuable continuous measurement of attitudes throughout the first
wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, it meant that, by random chance, we did not interview respondents from every (small) region during every survey day. Consequently, our survey data is
an imbalanced panel. This imbalance leads to noisy estimates when zeroing in on the withinregion variation in our DID regressions. Post-stratifying the data allows us to address this
concern and simultaneously adjust for demographic differences between our sample and the
population. To estimate daily regional averages from individual-level survey responses, we use
multilevel regression with post-stratification (MRP) [23].
First, we construct a Bayesian multilevel model that predicts a survey response as a function
of respondents’ place of residence, survey day, their age (in 10 age groups) and sex. We estimate
13

separate models for each survey outcome with a linear predictor taking the following form:

age-sex x cntry x week
day x reg
age-sex x reg
+ αa,c[r],w[d]
µd,r,a =α0 + αd,r
+ αa,r

The parameter αday,reg captures the mean on each survey day in each region net of all regional differences in the age-sex distribution (captured by the parameter αage-sex,reg ), shifts in the
country-specific age-sex distribution across the survey weeks (αage-sex, cntry, week ) and the grand
mean (α0 ). We use r to index a region, d a survey day, c a country and w a survey week. We
model all the three parameter batches hierarchically:

day x region
day x ctry
2
αd,r
∼ N (αdday + αrreg + αd,c[r]
, σday
x reg )
day x ctry
2
αd,c
∼ N (αcctry , σday
x ctry )
age-sex x reg

x reg )
age-sex x ctry x week
week
2
αa,c,w
∼ N (αw
, σage-sex
x ctry x week ).

The most important feature of this hierarchical structure is that it shrinks the daily regional
mean toward the sum of the daily mean, the regional mean and the country-specific, daily
deviation. This shrinkage allows to reduce noise in our post-stratification estimates originating
in regions with few daily observations. To complete the model we follow standard practice and
assign weakly informative prior densities. For more details, see SI Section 2.
Our post-stratification estimate θd,r —the average survey outcome in region r on survey day
d—is constructed by summing over a draw from the posterior predictive density for each agesex group in each region and on each survey day (µpred
d,r,a ), weighted by the relative size of the
age-sex group in a particular region, i.e.:

θd,r =

X

d,r,a

Nr,a

To construct the weights, we rely on data from Eurostat (European Statistical Office) and the
US Census Bureau. We construct 1,000 balanced panel datasets with these post-stratification
estimates by repeatedly drawing from the posterior predictive density.
14

Difference-in-difference analysis
To estimate the effect of the introducing and reversing restrictions, we combine our poststratification estimates with the Lockdown Index (LI). Our baseline specification, used for the
results in Figure 2, is a two-way fixed-effect estimator:

θd,r = γ0 + γd + γr + δLId,r + d,r
where γd and γr denote the day and regional fixed-effect. We estimate the model on each
of the 1,000 balanced panel datasets and summarize the posterior distribution of the δ using the
95% quantile and the mean.
In additional specifications we study of the effect of introducing and reversing severe restrictions (LI > 3). These specifications follow a difference-in-difference design with lead and
lags for the treatment to study the evolution of the treatment effect (Figure 3). Our specification
for introducing severe restrictions takes the following form:

θd,r = γ0 + γd + γr +

6
X

βm D(m)d,r + d,r ,

m=−6

where m is the day before/after a policy change and D(m)d,r it is the treatment indicator that
takes on the value one on day m for those regions that introduce restrictions (except for D(6)d,r
which takes the value one on day 6 and every day thereafter). In this way, the coefficients
on the indicators D(1)d,r − D(6)d,r measure the effect of restrictions on day one to six (and
thereafter) while the coefficients on the remaining indicators (D(−6)d,r − D(0)d,r ) are placebo
checks to test if there are non-parallel pre-treatment trends. The specification for the reversal of
restrictions is the same except that D(m)d,r encodes a reversal.
To estimate the effect of introducing (and reversing) severe restrictions, we fit the DID model
to each of the 1,000 balanced panel datasets but we subset to regions that introduced or reversed
restrictions during the study period (switcher regions). We remove all regions that either always
had restrictions or that never introduced them. When estimating the effect of a reversal, we also
remove all days prior to the introduction of the restriction, so as to not violate the parallel trends
assumption by construction.

Data Collection and Preparation

1.1

Survey

The target population for our daily, cross-sectional surveys included all adult residents that
are at least 18 years old and were living in France (excluding overseas territories and Corsica), the United Kingdom (UK; excluding Northern Ireland and British overseas territories),
Switzerland, Germany and the United States (US; excluding Alaska and Hawaii).
The daily target sample was N = 75 per country for the four European countries and
N = 100 for the US. We realized, on average, 85 survey completions (per country) in Europe
and 104 in the US. Field work began on March 16, 2020 in the US and on March 19, 2020 in
Europe. We ended field work on May 19 in Europe and continued surveying in the US until
July 9. Our analysis sample is the common field period from March 19 to May 19.
We conducted our surveys online using existing respondent pools. We used online surveys
as they pose no health risks to enumerators or respondents. For the four European countries,
we contracted with the survey company Respondi, and for the US, we recruited respondents
from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Extant research shows that the online survey
providers with which we contract, provide samples that allow for inferences (see Berinskey
et al., 2012 for MTurk and Bansak et al., 2016 for Respondi).
All adults (of least 18 years of age) that lived in the five study countries were eligible to
participate. Participants were informed by our online survey providers that they had been
invited to participate in a social science study. Participants had the opportunity to decide
to click or not on an invitation link. Participants that wished to participate clicked on the
invitation link and were directed to the survey landing page provided by the survey software
Qualtrics.
On average, respondents received 0.70 Euros for completing our survey. The survey data
collection was approved by the Ethics Commission of ETH Zurich (EK 2020-N-43).
Our survey included a series of survey items to measure the concepts described in the
main text. We describe these survey items below. We additionally collected some basic
demographic information about respondents, including their region of residence.
The first dimension of civic attitudes that our survey captured is regime support. We
elicited respondents’ support for different regimes using the following survey prompt: “Below,
we describe various types of political systems. For each one, would you say it is a very good,
fairly good, fairly bad or very bad way of governing?” The associated items read as follows:
• Having a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament

2

• Having experts, not government, make decisions according to what they think is best
for the country
• Having the army rule the country
• Having a democratic political system
We next asked respondents about their satisfaction with the performance of democracy
in their country and the current government. We asked “How satisfied are you with the way
democracy works in [Respondent’s country]?” and “How satisfied are you with the way the
people now in national office are handling [Respondent’s country’s] affairs?” Respondents
could answer with a four-point scale ranging from very satisfied to very dissatisfied.
In addition, we asked respondents about whom they intended to vote for in the next
general election. In the US, the survey question read as follows: “If there were a presidential
election tomorrow, would you vote for the Democrat, the Republican, or another candidate?”
(followed by the items “Democrat”, “Republican”, “Another candidate” and “I wouldn’t
vote”). In Europe the survey question read: “If there were a national election tomorrow, for
which party would you vote?” We list all major parties as well as the items “Other (please
specify)” and “I wouldn’t vote” as response options.
The second dimension of civic attitudes our survey aimed to capture gauge the attitudinal
foundations of regime support. To measure authoritarian attitudes, we asked respondents to
indicate agreement or disagreement with the following statements using a seven-point scale
ranging from very strongly agree to very strongly disagree:
• It’s great that many young people today are prepared to defy authority.
• What our country needs most is discipline, with everyone following our leaders in unity.
• Our society does NOT need tougher government and stricter laws.
• The facts on crime and the recent public disorders show we have to crack down harder
on troublemakers, if we are going preserve law and order.
To measure generalized trust we used the survey question: “Generally speaking, would
you say that most people can be trusted or that you can’t be too careful in dealing with
people?” Respondents were presented an 11-point scale with poles labeled “0 - Can’t be too
careful” and “10 - Most people can be trusted.”
We used feeling thermometer questions to measure outgroup hostility. The survey prompt
read as follows: “We would like to get your feelings toward a number of groups on a feeling
thermometer. A rating of 0 degrees means you feel as cold and negative as possible. A rating
3

of 100 degrees means you feel as warm and positive as possible. You would rate the group
at 50 degrees if you don’t feel particularly positive or negative toward the group.”
• How do you feel toward [demonym for people from respondent’s country]?
• How do you feel toward Immigrants from Europe?
• How do you feel toward Immigrants from Syria?
• How do you feel toward immigrants from Australia?

1.2

Government Policies

Our data on governments’ policy responses come from official government websites and
media outlets. We collected this information at the national level for all five countries, and
across various regional level: states (Germany and the US), cantons (Switzerland), regions
(France), and constituent countries (UK). Our data collection covered all policies issued
by governments in responses to the pandemic up to May 19. We focused on measures,
guidelines, laws, and ordinances that aim to contain or slow the spread of COVID-19 and/or
compensate citizens and business for the hardship due to COVID-19. In addition, we also
collected information on the lifting of restrictions.
In total, we collected information on 2,961 policies across all survey countries (US: 1,364;
UK: 123; France: 57; Germany: 874 and Switzerland 543).
Based on information about the date of announcement and content of each policy, we
constructed a six-point Lockdown Index. For each of the following three policies in place, we
added one to the score: closures of non-essential shops and non-take-out service at bars and
restaurants; closures of schools and/or daycares; forbidding of public and private events of 50
people or more. If there is a recommendation to stay at home and/or shelter in place, we also
added one. If this is an order to stay at home and/or shelter in place but if that order has
several exceptions for essential activities, we added two. Finally, if there is a stay at home
and/or shelter in place order with only very limited exceptions and/or strong enforcement,
we added three. We used the same coding when it comes to government policies reversing
previous restrictions but instead of adding the value, we subtract it from the index. The final
index encodes the strength of national and regional government restrictions in each region
and each day during our study period. Figure S.1 shows the average Lockdown Index across
five countries.
For additional analysis reported below, we also collected data on the number of economic
support packages announced by the government. Our Economic support index (ESI ) is

constructed by summing the number of support packages enacted by the government along
three dimensions: rent and/or mortgage forbearance; small-business loans; direct monetary
transfers to citizens (e.g., unemployment and direct cash transfers). For each new package
announced, we added one to the index on the day it is announced. For example, the government announces a stimulus package that increases unemployment benefits and offers loans to
small business. The index goes from zero to two. One week later, the government announces
support for rent payments and additional small business loans—the index then rises from
two to four. We collected this data at the national and regional levels.
Our data collection and measurement strategy for the Lockdown Index is distinct from
the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) and the CoronaNet Research Project, which focus primarily on measuring the stringency of COVID-19 response
policies on the national level (Hale et al., 2020; Cheng et al., 2020). The OxCGRT recently
began to also release data on policies at the subnational level in the US and construct a

subnational stringency index (Hale et al., 2020). Their stringency index is made up of eight
indicators: School closures; closings of workplaces; cancellations of public events; limits on
private gatherings; closing of public transport and orders to “shelter-in-place” and otherwise
confine to the home; restrictions on internal movement between cities/regions and restrictions on international travel. Each of these indicators is ordinal and they are summed to
construct the additive Stringency Index.
We here compare our Lockdown Index with the OxCGRT stringency index, by regressing
the OxCGRT stringency index on a series of indicators for the Lockdown Index levels. Table
S.1 demonstrates that there is a robust positive correlation despite only partial overlap
between the constituting indicators. The six-point Lockdown Index explains about a quarter
of the variation in the near-continuous OxCGRT stringency index. When we add fixed effects
for each state and each day, this correlation persists and the R2 increases to 0.81. This means
that state-specific changes of the Lockdown Index —the variation used by the difference-indifferences (DID) models in our analysis—are strongly associated with the state-specific
changes in the OxCGRT stringency index.

COVID-19 Death Counts

Data on the number of COVID-19 related deaths come from public health officials (e.g., the
Swiss Federal Health Office or the Robert Koch Institute) whenever possible. We supplement
the public health data with information from public health researchers when necessary. We
focus on deaths due to COVID-19 in favor of cases for two reasons: first, the number of
deaths is less likely to also depend on a country’s testing regime, and second, France did not
report case totals at the subnational level for the period covered by our data.

1.4

Data Preparation

We realized a gross sample of 30,200 survey responses. From those, we remove everyone that
did not consent to the survey terms or that was a minor at the time of survey (N = 274
survey responses). In Europe, some respondents started the survey, closed it and restarted
a few hours later (N = 70 individuals). We deal with these as follows: We first remove all
survey participations with a completion rate of less than 10%, then chronologically order each
respondents’ attempts, and keep the first response. This removes N = 73 survey responses
from the gross sample. Lastly, we remove all survey responses outside the common field work
period of March 19 to May 19 (N = 2, 457 survey responses). The final net sample includes
27, 317 survey responses. Table S.2 shows the descriptive statistics for our survey sample.

Outcome Coding

We next describe the outcome measures that we construct from the survey items. In the list
below, outcome measures used in the main analysis are in italic and survey items are in bold

7

(see above for descriptions of our survey items). With the exception of the outcome Relative outgroup hostility, we construct outcome scores by fitting principal component analyses
(PCA) with polychoric correlations on the pooled data. We standardize the PCA scores to
mean of zero and standard deviation of one.
• Political system scale: Scores from the first component of a PCA of Democracy best,
Technocracy best, Stratocracy best, Autocracy best.
• Democratic satisfaction scale: Scores from the first component of a PCA of Democratic satisfaction and responses of “I wouldn’t vote” to Vote choice.
• Government satisfaction scale: Scores from the first component of a PCA of Government satisfaction and reported intention to support the incumbent parties/candidate
Vote choice.
• Authoritarian attitudes scale: Scores from the first component of a PCA of Defy
authority, Follow leaders, Strict laws, and Crackdown.
• Trust scale: Scores from the first component of a PCA of Interpersonal Trust and
Feeling Thermometer: Natives.
• Relative outgroup hostility: The difference between Feeling thermometer: Natives
and the respondent-level average of Feeling thermometer: Europeans, Feeling
thermometer: Australians, and Feeling thermometer: Syrians.
• Restricted movement: Indicator for a response of “Yes” to the item “Due to Coronavirus/COVID-19, do you face any restrictions in leaving your home today?”

Methodology

In this section, we describe how we construct the daily, regional estimates using multilevel
regression with poststratification (MRP; Gelman and Little, 1997; Park et al., 2004). We
use these estimates as inputs for the difference-in-differences (DID) models that allow us to
estimate the effect of government restrictions.

2.1

Multilevel regression with poststratification

In a first step we construct a Bayesian multilevel model that predicts a survey outcome as a
function of respondents’ place of residence, survey day, their age and sex. We then use the

8

posterior predictive density of this model to form an estimate for all age-sex groups in all
regions and across all survey days. By summing over all age-sex groups within a region and
per survey day, we obtain an estimate of our target quantity.
Using multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP) allows us to obtain daily estimates across all regions that are more efficient as compared to raw survey means. Simultaneously, MRP allows us to account for i) potential differences between the age-sex distribution
in the sample and the population as well as ii) potential shifts in the age-sex distribution
over time.
2.1.1

Bayesian Multilevel Model

For each survey outcome, we estimate a separate multilevel model. The linear predictor of
all models takes the following form:

day x reg
age-sex x cntry x week
age-sex x reg
µd,r,a =α0 + αd,r
+ αa,r
+ αa,c[r],w[d]

The parameter αday,reg captures the mean on each survey day in each region net of all
regional differences in the age-sex distribution (captured by the parameter αage-sex,reg ), shifts
in the country-specific age-sex distribution across the survey weeks (αage-sex, cntry, week ) and
the grand mean (α0 ). We use the Gelman-Hill notation (Gelman and Hill, 2006) to let r
(region) or d (survey day) select the corresponding index c (country) and w (survey week).
We model all the three parameter batches hierarchically:

day x region
day x ctry
2
αd,r
∼ N (αdday + αrreg + αd,c[r]
, σday
x reg )
day x ctry
2
αd,c
∼ N (αcctry , σday
x ctry )
age-sex x reg
2
αa,r
∼ N (αaage-sex , σage-sex
x reg )
age-sex x ctry x week
week
2
αa,c,w
∼ N (αw
, σage-sex
x ctry x week ).

The most important feature of this hierarchical structure is that it shrinks the daily
regional mean toward the sum of the daily mean, the regional mean and the country-specific,
daily deviation. This shrinkage reduces noise in our poststratification estimates originating
from regions with few daily observations.
To complete the model we assign prior densities to all parameters. We follow standard
practice and assign weakly informative prior densities (Gelman et al., 2014). For all groupspecific parameters we use normal densities:
9

2
)
αrreg ∼ N (0, σreg
2
)
αcctry ∼ N (0, σctry
2
)
αdday ∼ N (0, σday
2
week
)
∼ N (0, σweek
αw
2
αaage-sex ∼ N (0, σage-sex
).

We use a unit-exponential density as prior for all five scale parameters of these normal
densities and another a zero-centered normal density for the grand mean:

σ.2 ∼ Exp(1)
α0 ∼ N (0, 10).
We implement this model using the R package rstanarm (Goodrich et al., 2020) which is
specifically tailored to estimate Bayesian multilevel models using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
(HMC) and the No U-Turn Sampler (Hoffman and Gelman, 2014). The generic syntax for
our model with a continuous outcome takes the following form:
mod <- stan_glmer(formula=
outcome ~ (1|country) + (1|region) +
(1|svyweek) + (1|svydate) +
(1|ageg_sex) +
(1|svydate:country) +
(1|svydate:region) +
x(1|ageg_sex:region) +
x(1|svyweek:ageg_sex:country),
family = gaussian(link = "identity"),
na.action = "na.omit",
prior = default_prior_coef(family),
prior_intercept = default_prior_intercept(family),
prior_aux = exponential(autoscale = TRUE),
prior_covariance = decov(),
prior_PD = FALSE,
10

chains = 8,
cores = 8,
iter = 2000,
algorithm = "sampling")
We use 8 chains and iterate each chain 2,000 times. Half of the samples for each chain
are used as warm-up to tune the sampler and the other half are taken as samples from
the posterior density. Table S.1 reports a series of standard HMC diagnostics (Betancourt,
2017). All of those suggest that the estimates are reliable.

2.1.2

Model Selection

We explored two competing specifications for the multilevel model. One featured a less
day x ctry
complex hierarchical parameter structure that does not include the term αd,c
. This
simplified parameter structure implies that the daily regional mean is not shrunken toward
the daily country mean but only toward the sum of the regional mean and the daily mean.
age-sex x cntry x week
Another more complex specification included replacing the term αa,c,w
with
age-sex x cntry x day
which allows for daily shifts in the country-specific age-sex distribution.
αa,c,d
This additional flexibility could accommodate potential differences, for example, in the agesex distribution among participants at weekends and weekdays.
We compared all three specifications using Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation as
described in Vehtari et al. (2017) and implemented in the R package loo. Table S.2 lists
the expected log pointwise predictive density (ELPD) for each model, the difference between
the two largest ELPD and the associated standard error of this difference. The ELPD
is a measure of a model’s of-sample predictive performance. Models that have a better
out-of-sample predictive performance (a higher ELPD) are generally preferred. The ELPD
11

is estimated based on Pareto smoothed importance sampling. All estimation diagnostics
suggest that the reported ELPD estimates are reliable.
Table S.2 demonstrates that for 5 out of 7 survey outcomes, our preferred specification
has the highest ELPD. Further, it shows that the difference in ELPD between our preferred
specification and the alternative with highest ELPD for these three outcomes is always less
than two standard errors. These results give us confidence in our specification selection.

2.1.3

Poststratification

Our poststratification estimate measures the average survey outcome in region r on survey
day d, and is denoted by θd,r . We construct it by summing over the posterior predictive
values for each age-sex group in each region and on each survey day (µpred
d,r,a ), weighted by the
relative size of the the age group in a particular region:
θd,r =

X

µpred
d,r,a

a

Nr,a
.
Nr

We construct 1,000 poststratification datasets by drawing parameters tuples from the
posterior predictive density.
The age-sex distribution for each region (Nr,a ) comes from Eurostat and US Census
Bureau. More specifically, we construct a population frame by age group, sex and subnational region that includes all adults (18+ years) living in France (excluding overseas
territories and Corsica), the UK (excluding Northern Ireland and British overseas territories),
Switzerland, Germany and the US (excluding Alaska and Hawaii).

12

2.2

Difference-in-Differences

To estimate the effect of the introducing and reversing restrictions, we combine our poststratification estimates with the Lockdown Index (LI). Our baseline specification, use for the
estimates in Figure 2, is a two-way fixed-effect estimator:

θd,r = γ0 + γd + γr + δLId,r + d,r
where γd and γr denote the day and regional fixed-effect. We estimate the model on each
of the the 1,000 poststratification datasets constructed above. We summarize the posterior
distribution of the δ using the 95% quantile and the mean.
In additional specifications we study of the effect of introducing and reversing severe
restrictions (LI > 3). These specifications mimic a DID design (Angrist and Pischke, 2009)
with lead and lags for the treatment to study the evolution of the treatment effect. Our
specification for introducing severe restrictions takes the following form:

θd,r = γ0 + γd + γr +

6
X

βm D(m)d,r + d,r ,

m=−6

where m is the day before/after a policy change and D(m)d,r it is the treatment indicator
that takes on the value one on day m for those regions that introduce restrictions (except
for D(6)d,r which takes the value one on day 6 and every day thereafter). In this way, the
coefficients on the indicators D(1)d,r − D(6)d,r measure the effect of restrictions on day one
to six (and thereafter) while the coefficients on the remaining indicators (D(−6)d,r − D(0)d,r )
are placebo checks to test if there are non-parallel pre-treatment trends. The specification for
the reversal of restrictions is the same except that D(m)d,r encodes a reversal of a restriction.
We estimate these DID specifications on each of the balanced panel datasets constructed
above, but we subset to regions that introduced or reversed restrictions during the study
period (switcher regions). We remove all regions that either always had restrictions or that
never introduced them. When estimating the effect of a reversal, we also remove all days
prior to the introduction of the restriction, so as to not violate the parallel trends assumption
by construction.

Additional Results

Table S.1 gives the estimates from our baseline specifications as displayed in Figure 2 in
the main text. Figure S.2 replicates this baseline specification using the binary version of
Lockdown Index (i.e., the version of the index used in Figure 3 of the main text). Figures S.3
and S.4 show the estimates separately for the introduction of restrictions and their reversals
again using the binary version of Lockdown Index and on the subsets we use for Figure 3
of the main text. Figure S.1 replicates Figure 3 from the main text for all other outcomes.
Figure S.9 uses weekly instead of daily lag indicators.
Figure S.5 shows the estimates from an extended baseline specification in which we add
the number of COVID-19 related deaths at the regional level to the model (Figure S.6 adds
the square root of the death counts as well). This helps us ensure that our comparisons focus
on respondents facing similar conditions but with divergent policy responses. However, the
spread of COVID-19 may be influenced by local policies—making it a post-treatment variable
that could introduce bias. For this reason, we prefer to fit models both with and without
this variable.
We next report the results of an extended baseline specification in which we add the
running daily count of economic support packages announced by the government and interact
this measure with the binary version of the Lockdown Index. Figure S.7 displays marginal
effect estimates from these models, i.e., the effect of lockdown policies conditional on a given
amount of economic support packages. This simple specification allows us to explore if
there is an indication that economic support package moderate the effect of the Lockdown
Index. That does not seem to be the case. For only one of our measures—the Government
satisfaction scale—is the interaction statistically reliable. For Political system scale and
Authoritarian attitudes scale, the two measures where we find reliable effects in our baseline
specification, the effects of lockdowns vary little across amounts of economic support.
In Figure S.8 we report the estimates from a specification in which we interact the binary
version of the Lockdown Index with an indicator measuring if a region was above/below
the median outcome on March 19/20. We find little evidence for substantial heterogeneity.
If anything, the estimates suggest that regions with a higher prevalence of authoritarian
attitudes are, on average, more affected by lockdowns.
Figure S.10 shows the estimates when we fit our baseline specification for each survey
item separately rather than combining them into a single score. To obtain these estimates
we proceeded in the same fashion as with our survey outcomes: We estimated a series of
Bayesian multilevel models, then post-stratified the survey responses and finally fitted the
DID models. The only difference is that we used a standard ordinal regression model (also

14

sometimes called a cumulative model) instead of a linear regression model to predict the
survey responses. Figure S.10 demonstrates that the effect on our Authoritarian attitudes
scale is primarily driven by respondents being more likely to agree with the statements
that it is important to follow leaders and to crackdown on troublemakers. The effect on
the Political system scale seems to be mostly driven by an increase in support for military
rule—potentially pointing to respondents’ desire for swift actions to combat the pandemic—
although there are also small (but unreliable) negative effects on support for democracy and
small (unreliable) positive effects on support for autocracy.
Figure S.11 replicates the pattern of our baseline estimates using an alternative estimation
methodology. For reasons described above, we prefer to first post-stratify the data via
Bayesian multilevel modeling, but we here show the results of estimating the DID models
directly on the “raw” survey data. We use the same baseline specification as in section 2.2
but also show models with age, gender, and the interaction between the two as covariates.
To account for potentially correlated errors within regions, we cluster the standard errors of
the coefficients by region. To account for missing values in the outcomes, we imputed the
data via multiple imputation using the R package mice and pool the regression estimates
according to Rubin’s rules (Rubin, 1987).
