"14" "ABSTRACT"
"15" "Objective:  To describe the methodology and baseline cohort characteristics of the COVID-19 Coping Study, a longitudinal mixed-methods study of US adults aged ≥55."
"16" "Methods:  Participants were recruited through online multi-frame non-probability sampling in April and  May,  2020. The baseline questionnaire focused on the effects of COVID-19 on daily life and mental health. Monthly follow-ups will be conducted for one year."
"17" "Findings:  In total, 6,938 adults participated across all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico (mean [SD] age: 67.3 [7.9]; 64% female). Two in three adults reported leaving home only for essential purposes in the past week (population-weighted proportion: 69%; 95% CI: 68%-71%). One-quarter of older adults in work before the pandemic reported reduced work hours or income (25%; 95% CI: 22%-27%). One in three screened positive for depression (32%; 95% CI: 30%-34%) and anxiety (29%; 95% CI: 28%-31%)."
"18" "Conclusions:  We observed substantial self-reported effects of COVID-19 on daily life and prevalent mental health symptoms in this cohort."

"21" "INTRODUCTION"
"22" "The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has dire immediate and long-term consequences for population health and well-being. Older adults are not only at elevated risk for severe morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, but may also be vulnerable to psychological, social, and economic harms associated with the pandemic. 1–3  Physical distancing, a necessary intervention to reduce transmission in the absence of a vaccine, was enacted through shelter-in-place orders and social distancing recommendations across most of the United States (US)  beginning in mid-March  2020. 4  At the same time, a deep economic recession took hold ,  with a 9.2% increase in unemployment recorded by the end of May 2020. 5  Older adults became a key population group of concern during this time, with public health reports identifying the highest rates of COVID-19  morbidity and  mortality in older adults. 6   As the United States struggled to control the pandemic, some s ubsequent   political and popular media  discourse  ha s   depicted “the elderly” as frail, burdensome, and disposable . 7"
"23" "The potentially complex mental health effects of  social and economic upheaval during  the COVID-19 pandemic  is unknown among  older  US  adults. While there is relatively little literature on this topic, self-isolation and quarantine during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) pandemics were associated with adverse mental health outcomes . 8 , 9   T hese pandemics were short-lived and less severe in scale than COVID-19 ,  with minimal impact in the United States . Emerging evidence  from the COVID-19 pandemic  indicates that shelter-in-place orders are associated with increased anxiety and loneliness in younger adults in the US, yet evidence among older adults   remains s parse . 1 0  Older adults may need to physically distance more intensely and for longer than younger population groups in order minimize COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, and may experience prolonged periods of isolation that health systems need to be equipped to handle. 3  However, the current lack of evidence on older adults’ mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic limits the development of targeted , equitable  public health strategies to support their short- and long-term health outcomes in the wake of this crisis."
"24" "We launched the COVID-19 Coping Study in order to investigate how  social and economic changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic are affecting the mental  health and well-being of older adults.   The purpose of this study is to provide data to inform public health strategies and policy interventions to support the  complex  needs of older adults.  We employed a longitudinal parallel convergent mixed-methods design to capture dynamic changes in the experiences and mental health of older adults throughout the pandemic. The objective of the present report is to describe the study methodology, recruitment, and baseline cohort characteristics."
"25" "METHODS"
"26" "Study Design and Eligibility"
"27" "The first upswing of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US happened  quickly , with rapid changes in vir al  transmission rates, governmental responses, and economic and social conditions.  Thus,   we  aimed to rapidly enroll a cohort of older adults into a national longitudinal study to assess effects of these changes on the mental health and well-being of this population. Eligible participants were adults aged ≥55 who resided in the US  ( including Puerto Rico )  and who were able to access and complete the online survey in English or Spanish. "
"28" "Study Recruitment"
"29" "We used a multi-frame online recruitment strategy to enhance coverage of diverse populations and geographic locations. This resulted in two study samples. The first was the “snowball sample”, which was recruited through social media including Facebook and Instagram advertisements, organizational mailing lists, the NIH  ResearchMatch  database, the  University of Michigan (U-M) Health Research  database, and word-of-mouth snowball sampling in English and Spanish. Because older adults may be harder to  recruit  online and through social media, snowball sampling was a key aspect of our recruitment strategy. 1 1 ,1 2  We encouraged study participants to recruit others through word-of-mouth, and we promoted the study to prospective participants as a way of understanding how older adults are coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. The second was the “panel sample”, which was recruited from an existing online research panel maintained by the professional survey company Dynata. We used sampling quotas for age, gender, race, ethnicity, and education that matched the general U.S. population aged ≥55 based on CDC WONDER data. 1 3 ,1 4  The panel sample was included to  increase sampling coverage and size, and to ensure inclusion of a sampling frame that socio-demographically r eflected  the general US population aged ≥55."
"30" "The snowball sampling frame launched on April  2 nd , 2020, with a target sample size of  n =1,254. This sample size was rapidly achieved, with high enthusiasm and strong snowball recruiting from study participants, local news outlets, and organizations working with older adults. We thus elected to keep baseline enrolment open until May 3 1 st , 2020,  and ultimately enrolled  n=6,938  participants  over   these  two months. The panel sampling frame had a target sample size of  n =2,500 and  ultimately enrolled n=2,485  participants from April 1 7 th  to May 1 5 th , 2020. The snowball sample participants did not receive compensation, while panel sample participants received a nominal amount."
"31" "Data Collection"
"32" "Baseline data were collected through an online questionnaire designed to take approximately 17 minutes, administered through  University of Michigan (U-M) Qualtrics . The questionnaire was designed for computer, tablet, and smartphone interfaces. The baseline questionnaire was developed in consultation with survey methodologists at the  Survey Research Center at the U-M Institute for Social Research . All participants provided online informed consent  before beginning the questionnaire . Participants in the snowball sampling frame were invited to provide their email addresses if they consented to be contacted for follow-up surveys. A total of 4,211/4,45 3  eligible respondents (95%) provided their email addresses for longitudinal follow-ups. Participants will be invited via email to complete 10-minute follow-up questionnaires monthly for one year. Beginning in October 2020 (approximately 6 months following the baseline), a sub-sample of 100 snowball sample participants will complete 45-minute, semi-structured in-depth interviews by telephone or secure video call."
"33" "Measures"
"34" "The baseline questionnaire assessed sociodemographic factors,  personal  COVID-19 testing and symptom history, social network burden of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality (family and friends with symptoms, positive tests, hospitalization, and death due to COVID-19), worry about COVID-19, attitudes towards governmental responses to COVID-19, self-isolation, frequency and types of contacts with family members and  friends, changes in daily behaviors, social media use, use of mobility aids, housing conditions, and  residence  zip code.  Racial and ethnic group categories were assessed according to US Census definitions . They   are  presented in this report according to categories of racialized identity, whereby  those who identified as multiple races were grouped to a single racial-ethnic category based on the social processes of US racialization  and  heightened racial sensitivity and hostility amid the COVID-19 pandemic . 1 5 ,1 6   We assessed the following mental health and self-rated health outcomes: depressive symptoms (8-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; CES-D), anxiety symptoms (5-item Beck Anxiety Inventory), loneliness (3-item UCLA loneliness scale), life satisfaction (scale of 0 through 10), and self-rated general health and self-rated memory (both 5-point Likert-type scales). 1 7 – 19"
"35" "We assessed self-reported pre-COVID-19 covariates: employment status ,  job industry according to the International Standard Classification of Occupations, smoking status, alcohol consumption ,  moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, physician-diagnosed health conditions, degree of social isolation (using the 5-point social isolation index from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing 20 ), usual mode of transportation ,  and  usual  household  co-habitants . Open-ended qualitative measures inquired about strategies that respondents  we re taking to help  them  cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, and any other experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic that they wanted to share. The  full  questionnaire is available  in the Supplementary Material and at  https://www.covid19copingstudy.com/."
"36" "Population Weights"
"37" "Given the non-probability nature of this  sample,   we developed  population weights to reduce potential selection and other non-sampling biases, such as coverage and nonresponse. The sample data w ere  calibrated to population totals estimated by the 2018 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year  e stimates with respect to selected sociodemographic dimensions.  T o maximize potential bias reduction and improve standard errors, these dimensions were selected by analyzing which main effects and interactions were most predictive of  the key mental health  outcomes  (depression, anxiety, and loneliness) .  This analysis  identified  that the main effects of age group (55-59 ;  60-64 ;  65-69 ;  70-74 ;  75-79 ;  80-84 ;  85+), education ( l ess than high school ; h igh  school diploma or equivalency ;   s ome college or 2-year associate degree ;   f our-year college or university degree ;   p ostgraduate or professional degree), race/ethnicity ( n on-Hispanic: White ;   n on-Hispanic Black ;   n on-Hispanic: Asian ;   n on-Hispanic:  o ther  r aces ;  Hispanic: White ;  Hispanic:  o ther  r aces), Census division (New England ;  Middle Atlantic ;  East North Central  –  MI ;  East North Central  –  Others ;  West North Central ;  South Atlantic ;  East South Central ;  West South Central ;  Mountain ;  Pacific), and the interaction between  sex  ( f emale ;   m ale) and marital status ( s ingle, never married ;   s ingle, divorced/separated ;   s ingle, widowed ;   m arried or in a relationship) would accomplish the goals  of population weighting .  The  East North Central  census  division was sub-divided into the state of Michigan and other states ,  given  the  over-representation of  Michigan  due to the recruitment in the snowball sample. Missing values on  sex , marital status and Census division were imputed through multivariate imputation by chained equations using age group, gender, education ,  and race/ethnicity  as covariates. 2 1   The calibration was conducted using a raking procedure over the selected dimensions listed above . 2 2 , 2 3"
"38" "Planned Analyses"
"39" "Planned analyses are quantitative and qualitative in nature, both  stand-alone  and combined following a parallel convergent mixed-methods design (Supplementary Figure 1). 24"
"40" "Quantitative analyses will investigate whether local neighborhood characteristics such as population density, poverty, racial residential segregation, access to services, and availability of parks and trails may modify  the  risk s  for poor mental health and  level of  social network COVID-19 burden during the pandemic. We will examine the relationships between physical distancing behaviors ;  loss of employment or income ;  and changes in depression, anxiety, and loneliness over time. Within-person assessments of these mental health outcomes will also allow us to investigate whether symptoms observed early in the pandemic are transient and improve over time, or if they persist and are potentially indicative of longer-term, clinical mental health implications as the pandemic progresses.  Qualitative thematic analysis of interview transcripts and interviewer fieldnotes will consider how older adults react to and engage  in local public health efforts, community infrastructure, social support networks, and economic activities to support their well-being throughout the pandemic."
"41" "In planned mixed-methods analyses, we will investigate whether particular coping behaviors such as exercise, alcohol consumption, virtual social connections, and mindfulness are associated with mental health outcomes, and will compare these findings to qualitative thematic analyses of  how  and  why  participants perceive that these activities may or may not help minimize psychosocial burdens during the pandemic. Other planned mixed-methods analyses will investigate changes in sources of worry and stress over time, associations with mental health outcomes, and  will gather  detailed qualitative insights into how thes e  responses vary by person and by context."
"42" "In the current report, we present the study recruitment details and baseline characteristics of the COVID-19 Coping Study sample, overall and according to sampling frame, with and without population weights applied. We further present the  population- weighted distributions of key exposure and mental health outcome data that will be used in future planned analyses, overall and by age group (55-64 years, 65-74 years, and 75+ years). The map of participant responses was created using ArcGIS Online (Redlands, CA), and all other statistical analyses were conducted using StataSE  16.0  (College Station, TX)  and R  4.0.0  ( Vienna, Austria)."

"46" "RESULTS"
"47" "A total of 4,453 participants were recruited into the snowball sample, with 4,401 questionnaires completed in English and 52 in Spanish. A total of 2,485 were recruited into the panel sample, for a total N of 6,938 (Figure 1). Participants were in all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico (Figure 2). Mean age of the total sample was 67.3 (SD: 7.9; Range: 55-110), 64% were female (4,437/6,938), 84% were Non-Hispanic White (5,858/6,938), 6% were Non-Hispanic Black or African American (383/6,938), 5% were Hispanic or Latinx (349/6,938), 2% were East Asian, Native  Hawaiian, or another Pacific Islander (165/6,938), and 3% were of another racial or ethnicity minority group (183/6,938; Table 1). Half of respondents were retired (3,598/6,933; 52%), one-quarter lived alone (1,799/6,880; 26%), nearly half owned their home outright (3,239/6,938; 47%), one in ten used a mobility aid (578/6,778; 9%), and 51% had at least one diagnosed chronic health condition (3,521/6,938; Table 1)."
"48" "Table 2 describes  the population-weighted  self-reported impacts of COVID-19 on daily life and personal circumstances ,   and their distribution by  age group.  The corresponding unweighted distributions are shown in Supplementary Table 2.  The majority of  older adults  were “moderately” or “extremely” worried about the COVID-19 pandemic (Table 2). Less than 1% reported testing positive for COVID-19, while  8 %   of those  aged  55-64  (95% CI: 7%–10%) , 8%   of those  aged  65-74  (95% CI: 7%–10%) , and  3 %   of those  aged  75+  (95% CI: 2%–4%)  report ed  recently having COVID-19-like symptoms (Table 2). Respondents’ social network burdens of COVID-19 infection and mortality were higher in the younger age groups, with approximately twice as many people in the 55-64 age group as in the 75+ age group reporting  having  friends or family with COVID-19 symptoms, a positive test, hospitalization, or mortality (Table 2). Among those who were working prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the reported effects of the pandemic on employment were strongly graded by age (Table 2).  Approximately two in three  older  adults  across all age groups reported leaving their home only for essential purposes every day in the past week (Table 2)."
"49" "The baseline prevalence of  each of  depression, anxiety, and loneliness was strongly graded by age (Table 2). The prevalence of depression declined from 41% in the 55-64 age group  (95% CI: 38%–44% ) to 20% in the 75+ age group ( 95% CI:  17%–23% ). Anxiety prevalence declined from 3 6 %  of those aged  55-64 ( 95% CI:  33%–38% ) to 19%  of those aged  75+ ( 95% CI:  16%–23% ). The prevalence of ‘high’ loneliness declined from 3 5 %  of those aged  55-64 ( 95% CI:  33%–38% ) to 20%  of those aged  75+ ( 95% CI:  17%–24% ). All three scales had good internal consistency, with  Chronbach’s  alpha of 0.82 for the 8-item CES-D (depression), 0.75 for the 5-item BAI (anxiety), and 0.77 for the 3-item UCLA loneliness scale."
"50" "DISCUSSION"
"51" "Older adults may be at risk not only for the direct effects of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, but also adverse psychological, social, and economic consequences of the pandemic. 1,2, 7 ,1 0  We established the COVID-19 Coping Study to provide data on the mental health and well-being of older adults as affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 6,938  study participants aged ≥55 took part across all 50 US states,  DC , and Puerto Rico. This study will provide rich longitudinal quantitative and qualitative data on social circumstances, living conditions, economic impacts, COVID-19 symptom and testing history,  health behaviors,  geography , and a range of mental health and well-being outcomes .  These  data will be made publicly available.  The COVID-19 Coping Study may provide timely evidence to inform policy interventions to support older adults’ mental health and coping throughout the pandemic, such as  digital technologies for connectivity, enhanced mental health service provision, public education campaigns, and socially supportive municipal infrastructures. 2"
"52" "Pre-pandemic data from the nationally-representative US Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and National Social Life, Health and Aging Project (NSHAP) indicate a slight U-shaped pattern in depressive symptoms and loneliness with increasing age beyond 50 years and 65 years, respectively. 2 5 ,2 6  We observed decreased prevalence with increasing age, but had limited ability to stratify at the oldest age groups. In the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions  (NESARC)  in 2004/05, the prevalence of any anxiety disorder according to DSM-IV criteria among adults aged  ≥ 55 was 11.39% . 2 7  Prevalence  in the NESARC  declined with age, consistent with our data, although we observed a higher prevalence of anxiety symptomology at all ages  in this study . A recent meta-analysis of anxiety disorder prevalence among older adults indicates under-diagnos is  in this age range. 2 8  Longitudinal data from our study will be valuable for assessing the effects of specific pandemic-related exposures on changes in mental health symptomology and outcomes, and can be triangulated in the future against data from ongoing aging cohort studies like the HRS and NSHAP. 2 9"
"53" "Strengths of this study include its national coverage, large sample size, quantitative and qualitative mixed-methods approach, and ability to longitudinally track within-person changes in  mental health and well-being among  older adults during the  COVID-19 pandemic. Individual-level data are linked to geographic identifiers, which enables future analyses of area-level exposures including racial residential segregation, poverty, service access, COVID-19 burden, and COVID-19 control policy changes. Our  monthly  follow-up data collection period overlap s  with  the  nationwide Black Lives Matter protests against racism and police violence sparked by the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and  Ahmaud   Arbery   between February and May 2020 . 30  While not presented in this report, we  have  observed in-depth reactions to these events in the open-ended questionnaire responses  regarding  worries and stressors. We will analyze these qualitative data in relation to changes in mental health outcomes following these events. The merits of mixed-methods studies are increasingly recognized in health research, as they facilitate the combination of  standardized measures with  subjective insights on individuals’ realities. 3 1  Integrating different types of data can generate novel inquiry and understanding of  how the complex and evolving  social, political, economic, and public health circumstances in the US  are affecting  older adults’ mental health. 25, 3 2"
"54" "As evidenced by the  Domestic Public Health Response to COVID-19, public health interventions often support the interests of  population groups  who are likely to fully recover from COVID-19. 3 3  This excludes the specific needs of older adults who are at higher risk of severe morbidity and mortality due to the virus, and may perpetuate age-based health disparities. The present study collects open-ended participant reflections on factors that are influencing their mental health, and how they are addressing  stressors  and life changes related to the ongoing pandemic. This in-depth qualitative data recognizes that identity markers, such as ethnicity, race, gender, income, and language are not independent of one another, but rather can create a complex convergence of oppression and disparity if left unacknowledged. 3 4  Effective interventions must address multiple intersecting dimensions of identity, positionality, and social systems. Evidence on how these intersections are related to health inequities brought about and exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic will strengthen efforts to support diverse older adults throughout and after the pandemic."
"55" "The COVID-19 Coping Study has some important limitations. This study was launched during the first upswing of a major pandemic, and did not capture people who may have been too sick to take part in the study, such as those who were hospitalized  with COVID-19 or other health conditions. In our upcoming reports, we will compare our study sample prevalence of COVID-19 to published population data to evaluate and correct for any bias this may introduce into our estimates, as appropriate. Men, older adults from racial and ethnic minority groups, Spanish speakers, and those with high school education or less were under-represented in the snowball sampling frame relative to the general population. This may limit sample size for some stratified analyses, and may affect internal validity for certain analyses if these factors are correlated with a given exposure and outcome under study.  The population weights we generated   using the American Community Survey data  should  reduce  any potential selection bias due to these and other sociodemographic factors in estimates of the primary mental health outcomes under study. However, the weights may not account for unmeasured drivers of sample selection, and  may not necessar il y allow the estimation of population-representative prevalence estimates ."
"56" "All study data were self-reported  and  subject to recall error, which may bias results towards the null if non-differential according to the outcome(s) of interest, or in a direction away from the null if differential according to the outcome(s) of interest. Missing data  among completed questionnaires  were uncommon, with most variables being complete or having less than 5% of observations missing. We recruited for this study and collected data using online methods, so our findings may not be generalizable to non-internet users. Although internet use is high among older adults in the US,   especially when considering access to mobile data through smartphones, individuals unable to use the internet during the recruitment period due to barriers such as illness, disability, or financial access could not participate. 35  However, the online modality allowed us to rapidly conduct this research at a low cost  during  a rapidly unfolding pandemic that limited physical interaction and affected people’s lives in dramatic ways."
"57" "Conclusion"
"58" "The COVID-19 Coping Study is a nationwide,  longitudinal mixed-methods  study that aims to identify  personal and contextual influences on  psychosocial and behavioral  changes among older US adults   as a result of the  COVID-19 pandemic.  It recognizes that the experiences of older adults are not monolithic, and integrates in-depth  qualitative methodology to enhance standard epidemiological questionnaire measures.  This study will provide needed empirical evidence on the specific challenges and resiliencies of older adults  during the pandemic , and is intended to inform targeted and equitable public health and community interventions  to support their mental health and well-being."
