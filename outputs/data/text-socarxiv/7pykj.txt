Abstract
During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, citizens and governments across the globe relied heavily
on the legacy media: Not only to inform people about fast-paced developments in the midst of a
crisis, but also to stimulate compliance with strict interventions. Prospect theory postulates that
gain versus loss framing may affect preferences for different interventions. In a conceptual
replication of Tversky and Kahneman’s seminal prospect theory, findings from surveys in the US
and the Netherlands (N = 1,121) demonstrate that gain frames of the coronavirus promote
support for risk-aversive interventions, whereas loss frames result in more support for riskseeking alternatives. Beyond these preferences, gain frames yield slightly more support for strict
interventions such as a lockdown than loss frames. Loss frames elicit stronger negative emotions,
such as frustration and powerlessness. The experience of powerlessness, in turn, mediates the
effects of loss versus gain frames on support for stricter interventions. Together, these findings
indicate that framing the pandemic in terms of gains may be most effective in promoting support
for the strict preventative measures that have been taken throughout the globe.

During the pandemic coronavirus in 2020, global media coverage mostly focused on the
loss of lives and the uncontrolled spread of the virus. Framing the pandemic in terms of losses
may foster panic and anxiety, which, in turn, can motivate behaviors related to the crisis (Van
Bavel et al., 2020). In their seminal prospect theory experiment, Kahneman and Tversky (1979)
demonstrate that people’s preferences for risk-seeking versus risk-aversive options can be
influenced by exposing them to logically equivalent information framed in terms of gains versus
losses. More specifically, people have a tendency to prefer a risk-aversive options when they are
confronted with gains, whereas they are more willing to select the risk-seeking option when
logically equivalent information emphasizes losses. This pattern has been replicated in many
different settings, such as health communication and economics (e.g., Meyerowitz & Chaiken,
1987; Quattrone & Tversky, 1988). In this paper, we aim to replicate the findings in the setting
of the global coronavirus outbreak in 2020. By asking people about their preferences for
hypothetical interventions to prevent the spread of the virus within the timeframe of this actual
crisis, we aim to test the effectiveness of gain versus loss framing in a setting where the
equivalent information presented resonates strongly with reality. Are gain frames more effective
than loss frames in promoting support for strict preventative interventions such as a lockdown?
The outbreak of the coronavirus in 2020 sparked heated debates on the global treatment
of the issue, and the measures taken by different governments have been received with mixed
support (Van Bavel et al., 2020). Many countries enforced strict rules and restrictions on public
life: universities and schools were closed, people were ordered to avoid crowds and social
interactions, and many countries enforced a lockdown on public life. In times of this global
crisis, it is important to investigate the role of communication on people’s support for different

PROSPECT THEORY IN TIMES OF A PANDEMIC

measures and policies: Do people comply more with strict interventions when certain aspects of
the pandemic’s consequences are made more salient?
Literature on media dependency theory demonstrates that people rely more on media
coverage in times of crisis or novel developments (e.g., Boukes et al., 2019) – people may thus
be susceptible to the specific ways in which the coronavirus is framed by the media at times
when the crisis surrounding the outbreak is novel and rapidly developing. Importantly, media
dependency has been found to positively predict compliance with pro-social behavior (Ho et al.,
2015). In this paper, we specifically focus on the role of equivalency framing in communicating
policy alternatives in times of crisis. Although emphasis frames present different interpretations
of events by making salient different interpretations of problems, causes, moralities, and/or
treatments (e.g., de Vreese, 2005; Entman, 1993; Scheufele, 1999), equivalency frames present
information that is logically equivalent, but organized or presented in a different way (e.g.,
Druckman, 2001; Tversky & Kahneman, 1981).
The most well-known application of equivalency framing is prospect theory or gain
versus loss framing (e.g., Tversky & Kahneman, 1981). It has been found that presenting the
same information in a way that focuses on gains results in a stronger preference for riskavoidance policies, whereas the emphasis on losses results in preferences for riskier policies.
Tversky and Kahneman tested prospect theory by referring to a potentially lethal Asian disease.
In the conceptual replication presented in this paper, we aim to assess whether the same effects
of logically equivalent gain and loss-framed information on policy preferences can be identified
when the threat is not hypothetical, but part of a global crisis situation. In addition, we explore
the role of discrete emotions in promoting policy preferences and compare two most-different

PROSPECT THEORY IN TIMES OF A PANDEMIC

national settings in which the outbreak has had different ramifications for policy making: the US
and the Netherlands.
This paper aims to offer unique insights into the effects of gain versus loss framing in a
natural experimental setting. In times of crisis, information is oftentimes conflicting, fast-paced,
and surrounded by inconsistencies and confusion. Yet, the demand for information is high. In
such a communicative setting, it is important to assess how the different presentation of the same
information may result in different levels of compliance with interventions proposed by the
authorities.
Equivalency Framing and Prospect Theory
There are different approaches and conceptualizations of framing. For this reason, it is
important to explicate how framing is conceptualized in this study (e.g., Cacciatore, Scheufele &
Iyengar, 2016). Frames can be understood as patterns of interpretation that give meaning to
issues and events. Frames emphasize some aspects of reality, whereas other aspects are made
less salient (e.g., De Vreese, 2005; Entman, 1993; Gamson & Modigliani, 1987; Scheufele,
1999). On the most general level, we can distinguish equivalency and emphasis framing (e.g., de
Vreese, 2005). Emphasis frames do not present equivalent information, but emphasize different
aspects of reality by focusing on different problem definitions, causal interpretations, moral
evaluations, and/or treatment recommendations (Entman, 1993). Equivalency frames, in contrast,
organize or present events and situations differently, but rely on logically equivalent information
(Druckman, 2001; De Vreese, 2005). This paper focuses on such equivalency frames: We aim to
investigate how different emphasis on logically equivalent information on the spread of the 2020
coronavirus can affect people’s policy preferences and emotional states.
We specifically look at gain versus loss framing – a particular application of equivalency

PROSPECT THEORY IN TIMES OF A PANDEMIC

framing (Druckman, 2001; Tversky & Kahneman, 1981). Gain and loss framing research has
mostly been conducted on health communication (e.g., Meyerowitz & Chaiken, 1987) – and
applied to behavioral intentions toward prevention and detection behavior, for example, skin
cancer protection or screening. The main thesis guiding gain versus loss framing research is that
when gains of a certain targeted behavior are emphasized (i.e., if you quit smoking, you will
have a better condition), people tend to prefer risk-aversive or cautious behaviors (Rothman &
Salovey, 1997). However, when losses are emphasized (i.e., you may get sick if you do not quit
smoking), people have a tendency to prefer riskier options.
Prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1981; Tversky & Kahneman, 1979) postulates
that presenting or framing issues in terms of gains motivates people to play it safe, and thus to
prevent harm and protect the status quo. However, when people are framed with dooming losses,
people have the motivation to take a risk in order to not let the worst-case scenario happen. In
other words: positive outcomes should be protected (even if this means that an even more
positive outcome cannot be achieved), whereas the threat of being worse off sparks the
motivation to avert losses, even if this means that there is a possibility that the situation is getting
worse.
Although prospect theory has been tested in numerous studies on economic,
environmental, and health issues (e.g., Loroz, 2007; Segev et al., 2015), to the best of our
knowledge, there has been little evidence on the prospect theory in the real-life setting of a
global health crisis. Hence, it can be argued that gain versus loss framing has different effects
when people are asked to ‘imagine’ a crisis situation compared to when this crisis is actually
occurring. The more personally relevant the outcome is, the stronger the effects of gain versus
loss framing may be. Against this backdrop, we aim to replicate findings on prospect theory in

PROSPECT THEORY IN TIMES OF A PANDEMIC

7

the midst of the global outbreak of the coronavirus in 2020. In line with the premises of prospect
theory, we hypothesize that: Framing the coronavirus in terms of losses promotes support for
risk-seeking treatments (H1a), whereas framing the coronavirus in terms of gains promotes
supports for risk-aversive treatments (H1b).
The Effect of Gain versus Lost Framing on Policy Preferences
In line with Tversky and Kahneman’s (1981) findings, and replications of prospect
theory, it can be expected that framing the corona outbreak in terms of gains may motivate
people to prefer risk-aversive or preventative policies, whereas the emphasis on losses should
result in the preference for risk-seeking options. Beyond giving people the option to indicate
their preference among two alternative programs, we aim to assess the extent to which gain
versus loss frames correspond to more specific policy preferences that have been used to deal
with the crisis.
Here, we follow prospect theory literature in the field of health communication (e.g.,
Rothman & Salovey, 1997). Gain frames should promote relatively more support for prevention
behaviors than loss frames (Rothman & Salovey, 1997), which translates into support for
measures that fight the coronavirus by staying at home, for example (i.e., self-isolation prevents
the spread). Overall, gain frames have been found to be more effective under conditions in which
the elimination of risk is the desired outcome (e.g., Dijkstra, Rothman, & Pietersma, 2011) –
which corresponds to the strict preventions to fight the pandemic proposed by governments
throughout the globe (Van Bavel et al., 2020). Against this backdrop, we propose the following
hypothesis: Gain frames are more effective in triggering support for stricter preventative
measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus than loss frames (H2).

The Effects of Gain versus Loss Framing on Emotions
In the midst of a pandemic, people’s responses may be informed by negative emotions,
such as fear and anxiety (e.g., Mobbs et al., 2015; Van Bavel, 2020). Applied to the effects of
gain and loss frames in the context of a severe global crisis surrounded by threats and insecurity,
people’s support for different policies and treatments of the crisis may be informed by the
emotional evaluation of the crisis situation. We specifically rely on emotional framing effects
literature (e.g., Gross & D’Ambrosio, 2004; Druckman & McDermott, 2008) which uses
appraisal theory to understand how different frames elicit different emotional states by triggering
different cognitive evaluations of events.
Gain and loss frames may present equivalent information, but arguably present
alternative lines of reasoning that strongly diver in valance. Hence, they may promote different
appraisals that may correspond to different emotional states (Druckman & McDermott, 2008).
Gain focuses on hope, positive outcomes, improvement, and the potential alleviation of the
crisis. Loss, in contrast, emphasizes a negative future situation in which the crisis will intensive.
Appraisal theory postulates that the experience of emotional states – such as hope, fear or anger
– can be seen as the outcome of people’s cognitive evaluations of events or phenomena (e.g.,
Gross & D’Ambrosio, 2004; Lazarus, 1991). Events or phenomena, such as the outbreak of the
coronavirus, elicit discrete emotions that are in line with an individual’s evaluation of that event
or phenomenon (e.g., Gross & D’Ambrosio, 2004). In other words, specific events, issues or
situations by themselves do not triggers emotions, but the specific interpretation or framing of
these issues and situation elicit emotional responses.
In appraisal theory, discrete emotions are associated with specific appraisal patterns,
which can be understood as the subjective interpretation or evaluation that corresponds with

PROSPECT THEORY IN TIMES OF A PANDEMIC

9

specific emotional states such as anger or fear (Lerner & Keltner, 2001; Nabi, 2003). Fear has,
for example, been associated with uncertainty and uncontrollability, whereas anger corresponds
to more controllability, certainty, and the reliance on existing evaluations (e.g., Lerner &
Keltner, 2001). Roseman (1991) offers a more elaborate overview of the different appraisal
patterns that can be associated with a wide range of positive and negative discrete emotions. In
an uncertain situation (such as the outbreak of the coronavirus), the presence of punishment and
absence of reward may cause frustration or fear. Yet, the absence of punishment and the
presence of a reward can cause hope. When outcomes are more certain, dooming losses (the
absence of rewards or punishment) may cause anger.
Applied to gain versus loss frames of the coronavirus, we specifically focus on six
discrete emotional responses that correspond with the different patterns of interpretation caused
by logically equivalent frames. Building on Roseman’s (1991) framework, we believe that gain
frames should cause more hope than loss frames. Specifically, in uncertain times of crisis, gain
frames highlight the potential absence of punishment, and the presence of rewards (people will
be saved). Loss frames, in turn, should cause the experience of negative emotional states: Anger,
fear, frustration and powerlessness. Hence, these emotions correspond with the negative prospect
of punishment/losses and the (un)certainty that many people cannot be saved and will die.
Together, we formulate the following hypotheses on the emotional responses caused by gain
versus loss framing of the corona crisis: Gain frames should elicit more hope than loss frames
(H3a); Loss frames should elicit more anger (H3b); frustration (H3c); fear (H3d), pity (H3e) and
powerlessness (H3f) than gain frames.
It has been argued that people rely on their emotional state to assess risks and motivate
behavior (Loewenstein, 2001; Van Bavel et al., 2020). Specifically, applied to the outbreak of

PROSPECT THEORY IN TIMES OF A PANDEMIC

10

the coronavirus, Van Bavel et al. (2020) argue that negative emotions may promote the approach
of more negative information, and promote behaviors that are both desirable in the context of the
spread of the virus (i.e., social distancing, washing hands) and less desirable for society (i.e.,
hoarding). They argue that the media have disproportionally focused on negative sides of the
pandemic (people who die) and less on a positive outlook (people who recover), and that these
negative frames are more effective in promoting action and negative emotions than positive
framing (also see Peters et al., 2006).
Emotions have been regarded as important mediators of framing effects (Lecheler,
Schuck, & de Vreese, 2013). Exposure to news frames is argued to cause emotional responses,
which motivate behaviors and attitudes subsequently (Lecheler et al., 2013). Especially when
looking at support for stricter policy measures in response to gain versus loss framing of the
coronavirus, it can be argued that people’s emotions drive their support for strong preventative
measures (Van Bavel et al., 2020). In line with the premises of appraisal theory, emotions are
experienced because people evaluate situations and events cognitively (e.g., Roseman, 1991).
These emotional states, in turn, may motivate support for policy preferences.
Extrapolated to the framing of the 2020 corona crisis, we expect that loss frames have an
effect on preferences for policy preferences via discrete emotional responses that correspond to
uncertainty and a lack of control. More specifically, the appraisal patterns associated with fear,
powerlessness and pity in particular relate to a lack of control as well as less reliance on existing
attitudes and motivated search for novel information (Roseman, 1991). We therefore postulate
the following hypotheses on the mediating role of emotions in promoting policy support in
response to loss versus gain frames: Loss frames promote support for stricter interventions to

PROSPECT THEORY IN TIMES OF A PANDEMIC

11

combat the coronavirus via the activation of the negative emotions fear (H4a), pity (H4b), and
powerlessness (H4c).
The Role of Perceived Relevance of the Coronavirus Threat
It may be argued that the effects of gain and loss frames are conditional on the perceived
susceptibility to the threat of the coronavirus. Messages emphasizing threats may be more
influential when they resonate with people’s perception of losing out because of the coronavirus,
and messages emphasizing gains may be more persuasive when people actually have hope that
the threat can be averted. In line with this, as argued by Mahoney et al. (2011), there may be
individual-differences that predict the susceptibility to the effects of gain versus loss frames.
In the context of the highly salient global issue of the coronavirus at the time of data
collection, we in particular zoom in on individual-level differences in the perceived personal
relevance of the issue. It may be argued that when people care more about an issue and its
potential implications for them personally, attitudes are more easily accessible than when an
issue is less relevant (Krosnick, 1989). In line with this, people have the tendency to accumulate
more information on issues they care about most compared to less personally relevant issues
(e.g., Krosnick, 1989). Applied to framing effects, the role of issue importance can be interpreted
in different ways. Lecheler, de Vreese, and Slothuus (2009) find that low-importance issues yield
stronger framing effect than high-importance issues. They explain this effect as a consequence of
the more accessible and fixed attitudes people have for issues they care most about: These
perceptions are thus more resistant to framing effects compared to issues that are lower on
people’s personal agendas – and for which people did not yet develop strong opinions.
For the specific case of the corona crisis, we expect a reverse effect of perceived personal
relevance. The pandemic is an issue high on the media and political agenda all across the globe,

PROSPECT THEORY IN TIMES OF A PANDEMIC

12

and citizens across the globe are constantly exposed to information on the developments on the
‘corona crisis’. As predicted by media dependency theory, media coverage has a stronger effect
on people for new situations that people have less knowledge about (Ball-Rokeach & DeFleur,
1977). As the coronavirus was novel and uncertain at the time of data collection, and as new
developments related to the crisis followed each other at an extremely fast pace, it is not likely
that people had already formed strong opinions on the coronavirus. Hence, people’s evaluations,
behaviors, and opinions in times of an emerging crisis are likely to be strongly dependent on the
information they receive from the media (Boukes et al., 2019). In this setting, it can be argued
that the more people perceive they are personally susceptible to the virus, the more likely they
depend on new information to form attitudes and behaviors to avert the threat. In other words, we
expect gain and loss frames to have the strongest effects on policy preferences among people that
perceive that they are vulnerable to the threats of the coronavirus framed in the message. Against
this backdrop, we formulate the following hypotheses: Loss frames have a stronger effect on
policy preferences among participants that feel susceptible to threats associated with the
coronavirus (H5a). Likewise, we effect that emotions in response to gain versus loss frames are
more pronounced among participants that perceive the threat as personally relevant (H5b).
In this paper, we assess the effects of gain versus loss framing of the corona virus in two
different national settings: the US and the Netherlands. These two cases were selected to
investigate whether framing effects differ in strength across settings facing different
consequences of the corona outbreak, different policy actions to avert the crisis, and different
distances to the epicenter of the outbreak (Europe was in the epicenter at the time of data
collection, and the US banned all travel from Europe as they were not facing severe
consequences of the virus at that stage). We do not specifically focus on national-level

PROSPECT THEORY IN TIMES OF A PANDEMIC

13

differences, but rather ask to what extent gain and loss frames have similar effects across settings
that differ in the national-level salience of the crisis.
Method
To test our hypotheses, we rely on a survey study with a between-subjects experiment
component among a diverse sample of participants in the US and the Netherlands. We exposed
people to either a gain-framed message of the coronavirus outbreak or a loss-framed message of
the outbreak.
Sample
Participants were recruited from mixed-resources panels of Dynata (N = 1,121. All
surveys were computer-assisted: in the US and the Netherlands, participants entered the digital
survey via an online invitation with a link to the study. As developments surrounding the virus
moved at an extremely fast pace during data collection (March 16, 2020), we made sure that all
valid completed responses were collected within 24 hours. The sample includes 50.9% female
participants (49.9% male, 0.2% other). 20.1% was lower educated, 42.7% finished a moderate
level of education, and 37.2% was higher educated. The average age was 42.46 (SD = 13.82). In
the US, the sample included 38.5% Democrats and 35.3% Republicans (26.2% Independent).
These proportions were reflected in the ideological self-placement of Dutch participants.
Although this national setting does not allow us to categorize people into bi-partisan preferences,
we see that 36.6% is more left-wing oriented, and 38.2% right-wing oriented (25.2%
undecided/in between).
Independent Variables
We followed the classical prospect framing approach (e.g., Tversky & Kahneman, 1979)
and randomly exposed participants to a gain-framed versus a loss-framed message and asked

PROSPECT THEORY IN TIMES OF A PANDEMIC

14

their preference for equivalent risk-seeking and risk-aversive programs. The classical ‘Asian
disease’ message was adapted to fit the context of the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. We
did not mislead participants, and clearly noted that we would like to present them with a
hypothetical example of different ways to deal with the crisis.
As developments surrounding the coronavirus developed in a rapid pace at the time of
data collection, we did not use actual numbers or statistics on the crisis, but presented
participants with a hypothetical situation in which different treatment programs could be
selected. The wording of the gain-frame condition was as follows: “Recently, there have been a
number of concerns about the treatment and spread of the coronavirus in the US/the Netherlands
– and there are many different opinions and perspectives on how we should deal with it. What if,
hypothetically speaking, there are two potential strategies to deal with the outbreak: Program A
and program B. Program A has the consequence that 65% of all contaminated people can be
saved. Program B has a 65% likelihood to safe all contaminated people, and a 35% likelihood to
safe none of the contaminated people.”
The loss-frame condition used equivalent statistics, but presented the treatments in terms
of losses: “Recently, there have been a number of concerns about the treatment and spread of the
Corona virus in the US/the Netherlands – and there are many different opinions and perspectives
on how we should deal with it. What if, hypothetically speaking, there are two potential
strategies to deal with the outbreak: Program A and program B. Program A has the consequence
that 35% of all contaminated people will die. Program B has a 65% likelihood that none of the
contaminated people will die, and a 35% likelihood that all of the contaminated people will die.”
Measures
Right after exposure to the gain or loss frame, participants were asked to indicate their

PROSPECT THEORY IN TIMES OF A PANDEMIC

15

preference for program A or B (“Which program has your preference?” ). A more elaborate
battery of specific policy preferences was asked after this question, in which we specifically
asked people to indicate they support and compliance for stricter measures that could be taken by
the government to fight the outbreak of the coronavirus. The following three items, all measured
on 7-point disagree-agree scales, were used: “It is important to lock down our country to prevent
the spread of the virus further”, “We need to take even more extreme measures to fight the
coronavirus”, and “I am afraid that we don't do enough to prevent the virus from spreading.” (M
= 4.78, SD = 1.44, Cronbach’s α =.79). These measures can be seen as indicators of people’s
support for more disruptive and strict interventions to prevent negative consequences of the
outbreak.
To measure the discrete emotions people experienced related to the coronavirus, we
formulated the following question, which was asked after the stimulus and before measuring
people’s support for stricter governmental interventions: “And can you now indicate what
emotions you experience when thinking about the impact of the coronavirus?” The following
emotional states were asked with single-item measures on 7-point scales (1 = I do not feel this
emotional at all, 7 = I experience this emotion very much): anger (M = 3.89, SD = 1.87), fear (M
= 4.28, SD = 1.75), pity (M = 4.27, SD = 1.73), hope (M = 4.57, SD = 1.62), frustration (M =
4.61, SD= 1.73), and powerlessness (M = 4.89, SD = 1.70).
Manipulation Checks
After exposure to the stimuli, we asked participants to rate the credibility of the different
gain and loss-framed messages, as well as to remember the statistics they were exposed to, and
which program entailed which consequences. Both the gain and loss frame were perceived as
relatively credible examples of information on the coronavirus outbreak (Gain: M = 4.87, SD =

PROSPECT THEORY IN TIMES OF A PANDEMIC

16

1.51 ; Loss, M = 5.01 , SD = 1.48). In addition, loss frames were significantly more likely to be
perceived as emphasizing deaths and losing lives (86.6%) compared to gain frames (29.6%),
which were more likely to be seen as focusing on saving lives (89.5%) than the loss frames
(34.7%).
Results
The Effect of Gain and Loss Framing on Policy Preferences
We first of all hypothesized that loss framing would promote support for risk-seeking
programs, and that gain frames promote support for risk-aversive programs (H1). Our data
supports this expectation in both countries (see Table 1). Overall, support for the risk-aversive
program A mostly comes from people exposed to gain frames: 63.9% of its support is found
among participants exposed to the gain frame, whereas only 36.1% comes from people exposed
to the loss-framed condition. For program B, we see the reversed pattern: 76.0% prefer this
program when exposed to the loss frame, and 24.0% of its support comes from the gain frame.
We thus find convincing support for H1a: framing the coronavirus in terms of losing lives
enhances strong support for a risk-seeking program that has a good chance of saving all people,
which comes at the risk of saving none. H1b is also supported: When emphasizing that people
can be saved by an intervention, people mostly support the risk-aversive option that can protect a
large proportion of all people. In this condition, participants refrain from taking the risk to safe
all at the cost of saving no one.
But what if we look at the effects of gain versus loss framing on less clear-cut binary
decisions? Hence, in real life, policy measures and interventions to fight the coronavirus are less
explicitly referring to consequences in terms of risking or saving lives. In Table 2, the effects of
gain and loss framing on support for the specific (strict) policy measures that have been taken at

PROSPECT THEORY IN TIMES OF A PANDEMIC

17

the time of the coronavirus are summarized. We see that there is only a marginally significant
effect of gain versus loss framing on support for stricter governmental interventions. As
hypothesized (H2), gain frames yield more support for preventative measures to fight the
coronavirus than loss frames. Yet, as the effect is only marginally significant, we only find
limited support for the expectation that gain frames are more effective in promoting support for
intervention than loss frames.
The Effects of Gain and Loss Frames on Discrete Emotions
We hypothesized that exposure to a gain frame would elicit hope (H3a) whereas loss
frames correspond to negative discrete emotions (H3b-f). The results are depicted in Table 2.
First of all, the results indicate that exposure to a gain versus loss frame does not elicit different
levels of hope, which does not support H3a. However, we see a marginally significant negative
effect of gain versus loss frames on anger, which in support of H3b indicates that loss frames
yield higher levels of anger than gain frames. A similar effect is found for frustration:
participants exposed to a loss framed message of the corona virus experience more frustration
than participants exposed to a gain frame – which supports H3c. However, as can be seen in
Table 3, gain versus loss frames do not elicit different levels of fear (H3d) or pity (H3e).
However, the results do offer support for H3f: loss frames result in higher levels of
powerlessness than gain frames.
Taken together, we find partial support for the expectation that gain versus loss frames
activate differential emotional responses. Although gain frames do not promote more positive
emotions than loss frames, we do see that the negative loss frame elicit more anger, frustration,
and powerlessness than gain frames. But to what extent do these emotional responses mediate
the effects of gain versus loss framing on support for stricter governmental interventions?

PROSPECT THEORY IN TIMES OF A PANDEMIC

18

We estimated mediation models using the R-package mediation (Tingley et al., 2011),
with robust standard errors and 1,000 simulations and Quasi-Bayesian Confidence Intervals. For
fear, the ADE (Average Direct Effect) and ACME (Average Causal Mediation Effect) are not
significant – indicating that fear does not mediate the effects of gain versus loss framing on
support for stricter measures, which does not support H4a. The same results were found for pity
(H4b). The results do indicate that the mediation model for powerlessness yield a significant
ADE (B = 0.18, 95% CI [0.03, 0.34], p = 0.016) and ACME (B = -0.07, 95% CI [-0.13, 0.00], p
= 0.038). We thus find support for a partial mediation effect of powerlessness: loss compared to
gain frames yield higher levels of powerlessness, which, in turn, promote support for stricter
interventions. This supports H4c.
In sum, when we do not take emotions into account, gain frames are more effective in
promoting support for stricter interventions than loss frames. However, when we include the role
of powerlessness, we see that loss compared to gain frames indirectly promote support for
preventative measures via the activation of powerlessness. These effects are similar across the
different national settings.
The Role of Perceived Relevance on the Effects of Gain versus Loss Frames
The results of Table 2 summarize the effects of gain versus loss frames for participants at
different levels of personal relevance. First of all, it can be seen that the more people perceive the
threat of the coronavirus as personally relevant, the more likely they are to support stricter
preventative measures (Table 2, Model I). We also see that support for such measures is stronger
in the US compared to the Netherlands. However, we do not find support for H5a: there is no
significant interaction effect of perceived relevance and exposure to gain versus loss framing on
policy support (Table 2, Model III). In other words, individual-level differences in the perceived

relevance of the threat posed by the coronavirus does not correspond to different effects of gain
versus loss frames.
We do, however, see that perceived personal relevance significantly moderates the effects
of gain versus loss frames on anger and powerlessness (Table 3, Model III). This means that the
more personally relevant the threat is, the stronger the effects of loss versus gain frames on anger
and powerlessness. Participants that acknowledge the coronavirus as a stronger threat are thus
more likely to experience anger and powerlessness in response to loss versus gain frames. This
only provides limited support for H5b: Personal relevance of the corona virus threat moderates
the effects of anger and powerlessness, but not hope, fear, pity, or frustration.
Discussion
Social sciences may play an important role in understanding people’s responses to
pandemics such as the 2020 coronavirus outbreak (Van Bavel et al., 2020). Governments around
the globe rely heavily on their citizens to take proposed measures to fight the pandemic
seriously, and to engage in specific behaviors that contribute to the alleviation of the crisis. As
people are susceptible to media coverage on novel situations characterized by uncertainty and
threat (Boukes et al., 2019), the ways in which governments – or the media – communicate about
the coronavirus may thus have important ramifications for the extent to which people support
proposed policies and strict interventions requested by the authorities. Against this backdrop, this
paper presents the findings of a conceptual replication of Tversky and Kahneman’s (1979)
prospect theory in the setting of a crucial stage of the coronavirus outbreak in two different
settings: the US and the Netherlands. We specifically look at the effects of loss and gain frames
on (1) preferences for risk-seeking versus risk-aversive interventions; (2) stricter interventions to
fight the virus, and (3) discrete emotions, which in turn, mediate support for policy preferences.

The main findings provide convincing support for prospect theory in the midst of a real
crisis – the outbreak of the coronavirus that has claimed many lives across the globe.
Specifically, support for risk-aversive programs is about twice as strong under the condition of
gain than loss frames, and support for risk-seeking programs is three times stronger when people
are confronted with logically equivalent information that focuses on losses instead of gains. In
addition, looking at the more specific dependent variable tapping support for stricter
governmental interventions to combat the pandemic, our findings show that exposure to gain
frames yield more support for stricter interventions than loss frames.
These findings are in line with the findings of gain and loss framing effects in health
communication, which indicates that support for preventative measures or screening behavior
can be stimulated by using messages that emphasize the gains of preventions (Rothman &
Salovey, 1997). An important practical implication of these findings is that if governments want
to motivate support or policies and preventative measures that have more certain outcomes (i.e.,
preventions such a social isolation or a shut-down of social life), they should rely on gain frames
instead of loss frames (i.e., focusing on the amount of lives that can be saved if citizens
incorporate the advice to integrate preventative behaviors in their daily routines). Yet, daily
media coverage may impede this goal – as most legacy and alternative media coverage about the
corona crisis contains a strong negativity bias (Van Bavel et al., 2020). If media coverage wants
to promote support for the preventative measures suggested by many countries across the globe,
it is thus advised that they report more on the gains that can be achieved when people engage in
preventative behaviors, for example by staying at home, rather than the losses of not engaging in
this behavior.

Emotional responses play an important role in framing effects, and the way that people
feel in response to frames may affect their subsequent cognitions and behaviors (e.g., Brewer,
2001; Gross, 2008; Nabi, 1998; Powell et al., 2015). Crisis communication, and information
about pandemics in particular, may yield strong negative emotions (Van Bavel et al., 2020),
which may be instrumental in promoting desired behaviors as well as less constructive actions
(i.e., hoarding). Taking these emotions into account, the clear-cut difference between the effects
of gain and loss frames on promoting support for interventions may change. Indeed, our findings
illustrate that loss frames promote more negative emotions than gain frames. However, the
emotional states elicited by these frames only motivated support for stricter interventions for
powerlessness. This means that loss frames can promote compliance with strict governmental
measures, but only when they elicit feelings of powerlessness among receivers. These feelings
are reconciled by supporting strict interventions that may mitigate the threat.
In light of these findings, the relative persuasiveness of gain versus loss frames to
communicate (governmental) interventions to combat the 2020 coronavirus pandemic can be
understood as following: In the different national settings of the US and the Netherlands, which
were at different stages of the pandemic’s curve as well as governmental schemes at times of
data collection, gain frames that emphasize the number of lives that can be saved are slightly
more effective in promoting support for stricter interventions than loss frames that highlight the
number of cases that will die. However, loss frames may be effective in promoting support for
strict measures when the successfully mobilize a sense of powerlessness. Overall, compliance
with interventions may be most successful when governmental communication emphasizes the
gains that can be achieved when performing pro-social behavior, while at the same time

PROSPECT THEORY IN TIMES OF A PANDEMIC

22

emphasize efficacy beliefs (i.e., performing this behavior can successfully secure the gains
promoted).
Despite offering important insights of the implications of prospect theory for compliance
in the midst of an actual pandemic, this study has a number of limitations. First of all, the
experimental set-up did not include different factors that may have an impact on the
effectiveness of gain and loss frames. For example, we only focused on gains and losses in terms
of survivors and victims, whereas the actual debates surrounding the pandemic also involves
more indirect losses for the economy and the disruption of social life (i.e., loneliness, job
insecurity). Follow-up studies may take the differential consequences of the crisis situation into
account more explicitly. Second, as coronavirus-related information changed every hour during
data collection, we refrained from using real numbers in the gain and loss scenarios – even
though we emphasized that this was a potential scenario of the outbreak, it may be important for
future research to relativize these findings with the actual number of victims, which may only be
established in the aftermath of the outbreak. Related, although the experimental set-up aimed for
internal validity whilst optimizing realism of the information offered, our findings are still
collected in an artificial online experiment in which people make decisions about scenarios that
they would normally not encounter in this way.
Despite these limitations, we do believe that these findings have important implications
for understanding the effectiveness of using gain versus loss frames when aiming to promote
support for preventative measures when stakes are high: During the 2020 outbreak of the
coronavirus, governments and citizens throughout the globe relied heavily on the authorities’ and
media’s information, not only to inform them about what was going on, but also to guide
behaviors that would prevent negative outcomes.
