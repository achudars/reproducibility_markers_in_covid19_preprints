Perceptions of Inequality During the Coronavirus Outbreak

Abstract. It is known that Americans’ preferences for redistribution are generally not very elastic in
relation to their perceptions of inequality. Even localized crises such as Hurricane Katrina that lay bare
existing inequalities in society seem to do little to nothing in moving public opinion on this matter.
However, the coronavirus pandemic presents a new opportunity for social scientists and policy experts to
test whether large-scale national crises can lead to changes in people’s opinions. What is the impact of a
crisis of this proportion on Americans’ attitudes towards inequality? More specifically, is there an “added
value” to being informed about class inequalities ​in the context of the coronavirus outbreak compared to
being informed about such inequalities in general terms without reference to this extraordinary event?
This study answers these questions using an online experiment that manipulates the information
respondents receive prior to answering survey questions. I find that receiving information about class
inequalities ​specifically in relation to the outbreak tends to be much more effective in moving people’s
opinions compared to receiving that information in a way that does not directly relate it to coronavirus.
This suggests that attitudes can be moved by something as widespread and salient as the pandemic.

Perceptions of Inequality During the Coronavirus Outbreak
Introduction
Attitudes towards inequality is a key component of Americans’ distributional preferences, which
have been shown to affect their political and voting behavior (​Fisman, Jakiela, and Kariv 2017​).
We know that Americans generally prefer ​economic regimes that are at least somewhat unequal
(​Norton and Ariely 2011​, ​Norton 2014​), and that they are not particularly supportive of ​policies
intended to address inequality, at least traditional government redistributive policies (​Dallinger
2010​, ​McCall 2013​, ​McCall et al 2017​).
Evidence suggests that even large events such as the Hurricane Katrina disaster that
struck New Orleans in 2005 and exposed racial and class inequalities in the US (​Bobo 2006​,
Belkhir and Charlemaine 2007​) might not be enough to change Americans’ attitudes towards
inequality and redistribution. For example, ​Grusky and Ryo (2006) found that Hurricane Katrina
did not have much of an impact on raising awareness and activism in relation to inequality and
poverty in the US. Similarly, ​Sweeney (2006) found that even after Hurricane Katrina, most
Americans remained “color-blind” towards inequality.
Part of the reason why ​Americans’ views about inequality are generally not very elastic
to information is that inequality (un)awareness is rarely the main driver of those views. In
particular, it has been shown that low levels of support for redistribution are due not so much to
unawareness or indifference as to the failure to connect social issues and public policy (​Bartels
2005​, ​Kuziemko et al 2015​). Furthermore, given America’s entrenched political divide, most
Americans end up interpreting the information they receive in a way that aligns with their

pre-existing views, and so a “liberal” message about inequality is unlikely to change the opinions
of conservative Americans (​Grusky and Ryo 2006​, ​Sweeney 2006​).
Given this background, is there reason to believe that the coronavirus outbreak might
have an impact on Americans’ views about inequality? The coronavirus pandemic that we are
currently in the midst of resembles the natural disasters of the recent past, including Hurricane
Katrina in New Orleans and Camp Fire in California, in terms of disproportionately affecting
low-income people (​Pirtle 2020​, ​Ray and Rojas 2020​, ​Von Braun, Zamagni, and Sorondo 2020​).
However, the current situation is unique in terms of its scope: as opposed to the localized crises
of the past that primarily affected particular sites or states, the current crisis is a truly national,
even global, one. This is important because opinions are more likely to move when people are
directly affected by a given situation or when the concrete implications of the situation are made
clear to the people (​Connell et al 2006​, ​Lowe et al 2006​), and the coronavirus crisis has had a
direct impact on the lives of almost everyone in the country.
What is the impact of a crisis of this proportion on Americans’ attitudes towards
inequality? ​More specifically, is there an “added value” to being informed about class
inequalities ​in the context of the coronavirus outbreak compared to being informed about such
inequalities in general terms without reference to this extraordinary event? This study answers
these questions using an online experiment that manipulates the information respondents receive
prior to answering survey questions. I find that receiving information about class inequalities
specifically in relation to the outbreak tends to be much more effective in moving people’s
opinions compared to receiving that information in a way that does not directly relate it to

coronavirus. This suggests that attitudes can be moved by something as widespread and salient
as the pandemic.
The paper is organized as follows. The next section sets up the theoretical background
underlying the study and fleshes out the hypotheses being tested. The section after that describes
the methodological aspects of the study including experimental design, implementation, subject
recruitment, measures, and analytical strategy. The following section presents the main results of
the study related to inequality perceptions and redistributive preferences. Finally, the last section
discusses the main findings of the study and mentions ideas for future research.

Theoretical background
Inequality is high and on the rise in many countries around the globe, including the US ​(​Piketty
and Saez 2006​, ​McCall and Percheski 2010​, ​Alvaredo et al 2018​). One of the most tangible
consequences of inequality is health disparities within and between countries (​Murray, Kulkarni,
and Ezzati 2005​, ​Adler and Rehkopf 2008​, ​Braveman et al 2010​, ​Marmot 2015​). Disease
outbreaks such as the new coronavirus pandemic that we are currently in the midst of make
health inequalities all the more apparent (​Quinn and Kumar 2014​).
In the US, while governors around the country issued shelter-in-place and stay-at-home
orders in an attempt to “flatten the curve” (​Thunstrom et al 2020​), only some people are lucky
enough to be able to follow these orders; others have to go out everyday due to the nature of their
work or their financial status (​Valentino-DeVries, Lu, and Dance 2020​). Relatedly, minorities
such as African Americans and low-income people in general are reported to have higher risks of
mortality during the outbreak (​Dyer 2020​).

How is this situation affecting Americans’ attitudes towards inequality? In particular,
does becoming sensitized to class disparities “open people’s eyes” to inequality and make them
more supportive of redistribution? Or, does inequality awareness lead to a sort of “victim
blaming” whereby the disadvantaged groups are blamed for their situation? Preferences for
redistribution ​has been studied extensively in the social science and policy literatures, where
scholars have identified numerous factors that could affect these preferences and the demand for
more equal incomes.

Perceptions of inequality
The first set of factors is related to actual and perceived levels of inequality in the country,
including whether inequality is rising or not. The median voter hypothesis stipulated that as
inequality rises, support for redistribution rises as well (​Meltzer and Richard 1981​). While
Kenworthy and McCall (2008) found little empirical support for this hypothesis, ​Engelhardt and
Wagener (2014)​, ​Niehues (2014)​, ​Hauser and Norton (2017)​, and ​Gimpelson and Triesman
(2018) all make the same point -- and support it with empirical evidence -- that what matters
when it comes to policy preferences is not actual but ​perceived​ inequality.
McCall (2013) too investigates the relationship between perceptions of inequality and
support for government action against inequality but finds only weak evidence for this, at least in
the US. In a similar vein, ​Kuziemko et al (2015) finds that while information about inequality
has a significant effect on Americans’ views on inequality, such information is mostly ineffective
in moving policy preferences, with the exception of estate tax. On the other hand, ​McCall et al

(2017) finds that exposure to information about rising inequality actually has a significant effect
on respondents’ support for policies that reduce economic inequality.

Perceptions of opportunity and related concepts
Parallel to this research that studied the effect of inequality perceptions on preferences, and
inspired by some of the evidence that found weak to no inequality effect in this regard, other
researchers started instead from the premise that people may care more about ​something other
than economic inequality, such as economic mobility, opportunity, or simply a general sense of
fairness (​Starmans, Sheskin, and Bloom 2017​) -- these constitute the second set of factors to be
discussed. In particular, ​Alesina and Angeletos (2005) proposed a model that claimed that
societies where it is believed that individual effort -- as opposed to luck, family, connections, and
so on -- determines income tend to favor low redistribution and low taxes.
In line with this model, ​Alesina and La Ferrara (2005) found that Americans who believe
in the existence of equal opportunity are more likely to be against redistribution. ​Krawczyk
(2010) reached a similar conclusion that people are less willing to give to others when the
community rules emphasize effort as opposed to luck. Similarly, ​Bjornskov et al (2013)
discovered that there is a negative association between fairness perceptions and demand for
equal incomes. Finally, ​Shariff, Wiwad, and Aknin (2016) found that perceptions of upward
mobility​1 make people more tolerant of inequality, while ​Alesina, Stantcheva, and Teso (2018)
found that receiving pessimistic information about mobility makes respondents more supportive
of redistribution.​2

Inequality and government
The third set of factors relates specifically to Americans’ perceptions of government and its role
in society. As discussed in ​Kuziemko et al (2015)​, and before that in ​Bartels (2005)​, one possible
reason why Americans might not support government action on inequality is that they fail to
make the connection between social issues and public policy. Another reason, also discussed in
Kuziemko et al (2015)​, could be related to Americans’ low trust in government. Both of these
ideas would explain the apparent discrepancy between Americans’ concern for inequality and
their unwillingness to do much about it ​(​Bartels 2005​, ​McCall 2013​).

Socio-demographic factors
Beyond the three sets of core factors just discussed, many socio-demographic factors have also
been claimed to influence preferences for redistribution. In particular, researchers have shown
that high income is associated with less support for redistribution, while low income is
associated with more support (​Corneo and Gruner (2002)​, ​Alesina and La Ferrara 2005​, ​Steele
2015​). As discussed in ​Corneo and Gruner (2002)​, such a negative association between income
and support for redistribution can be explained in reference to self-interest -- they call this the
“homo oeconomicus effect.”
In addition to income, political orientation has also been shown to influence redistributive
preferences. The literature is in agreement that conservative people and Republicans are much
less likely to support redistribution (​Chambers, Swan, and Heesacker 2015​, ​Reynolds and Xian
2014​, ​Alesina, Stantcheva, and Teso 2018​). Furthermore, as the debate on whether Americans
over- or under-estimate mobility show (​Chambers, Swan, and Heesacker 2015​, ​Davidai and

Gilovich 2015​, ​Kraus and Tan 2015​, ​Swan et al 2017​), perceptions of mobility in the country are
divided along political lines -- with conservatives being much more optimistic about the state of
mobility -- which means that the effects of political orientation and mobility perceptions on
redistribution are very much connected.
Finally, while income and political orientation emerge as the key socio-demographic
predictors of redistributive preferences, other factors have also been found to be correlated with
this outcome. For example, educated people are generally less supportive of redistribution, and
females and minorities seem to be more supportive (​Corneo and Gruner (2002)​, ​Alesina and La
Ferrara 2005​, ​Steele 2015​).

Hypotheses
The fact that the coronavirus outbreak made existing inequalities in society all the more apparent
provides social scientists with a unique opportunity to understand how awareness of these
inequalities shapes Americans’ attitudes towards such inequalities and preferences towards doing
something about them. Based on earlier findings related to perceptions of inequality discussed
above, it is reasonable to predict that:

Hypothesis 1a—
​ Awareness of existing class inequalities in society will make Americans more
concerned about inequality and more sympathetic to the situation of the disadvantaged.

On the other hand, while a positive outcome such as this is expected based on the
literature, it is still possible that awareness of inequality will have the opposite effect through a

mechanism such as victim blaming whereby the weak is blamed for their unfortunate situation
(​Martin 2001​, ​Greenbaum 2015​):

Hypothesis 1b—
​ Awareness of existing class inequalities in society will make Americans less
concerned about inequality and less sympathetic to the situation of the disadvantaged.

Regardless of which way the effect moves people’s attitudes towards inequality, based on
the important point from the literature that concern does not necessarily equal willingness to take
action ​(​Bartels 2005​, ​McCall 2013​), it is crucial to have separate hypotheses for preferences
towards redistribution and reducing inequalities:

Hypothesis 2a—
​ Awareness of existing class inequalities in society will make Americans more
supportive of redistribution and reducing inequalities.

Hypothesis 2b—
​ Awareness of existing class inequalities in society will make Americans less
supportive of redistribution and reducing inequalities.

Once again, while the former hypothesis (​2a)​ is more plausible based on the literature,
the latter one (​2b)​ is nevertheless listed to be explicit about the possibility of the victim blaming
mechanism mentioned above. Finally, information about inequality specifically in relation to the
coronavirus outbreak -- a potential “rupturing event” -- may lead to a sense of urgency on the
side of the receiver (​Hedge and Yousif 1992​), which could in turn strengthen or amplify the

effect of inequality on the outcome. Similar to the previous two sets of hypotheses, we can write
down two separate hypotheses to remain agnostic to the possible direction of the effect. The
following hypotheses argue that coronavirus will amplify effects related to concern for
inequality:

Hypothesis 3a—
​ Awareness of existing class inequalities directly in relation to the outbreak will
make Americans even more concerned about inequality and even more sympathetic to the
situation of the disadvantaged compared to awareness of these inequalities in general terms.

Hypothesis 3b—
​ Awareness of existing class inequalities directly in relation to the outbreak will
make Americans even less concerned about inequality and even less sympathetic to the situation
of the disadvantaged compared to awareness of these inequalities in general terms.

And, the last set of hypotheses argue that coronavirus will amplify effects related to
support for redistribution and reducing inequalities:

Hypothesis 4a—
​ Awareness of existing class inequalities directly in relation to the outbreak will
make Americans even more supportive of redistribution and reducing inequalities compared to
awareness of these inequalities in general terms.

Hypothesis 4b—
​ Awareness of existing class inequalities directly in relation to the outbreak will
make Americans even less supportive of redistribution and reducing inequalities compared to
awareness of these inequalities in general terms.

Methods

Experimental design
The study is designed as a between-subjects survey experiment. ​Given that (i) any discussion of
the outbreak may or may not touch upon inequality, and (ii) any discussion of inequality may or
may not relate to the outbreak directly, the experiment randomized each respondent into one of
six conditions -- three of them having coronavirus-specific primes and the other three having
general primes (​Table 1​).
The three coronavirus conditions correspond to the three possible framings of the
pandemic: ​(1) the “equal pandemic” that is affecting all of us (coronavirus control); (2) the
unequal pandemic that is especially hard on poor and low-income communities, minorities in
particular (“coronavirus class inequality”); and (3) the unequal pandemic that is especially hard
on the elderly and those with medical conditions (“coronavirus natural inequality”). Directly
parallel to these are the three general conditions: (4) a brief history of the internet (control); ​(5)
class inequality without any reference to coronavirus; and ​(6) ​natural inequality without any
reference to coronavirus.​3

The experiment flows as follows. First, respondents are recruited into the study and asked
to give their consent. (At this stage, respondents are told that the goal of the survey is to
“understand the public’s opinions regarding important societal and economic trends in the US.”
This general wording is chosen over using specific words such as coronavirus and inequality in
an attempt to make sure respondents are not primed to think about these issues from the start.)
Second, they are asked to watch a short clip with subtitles and told that the purpose of showing
this video is to assess their comprehension skills; the content of the clips depends on the
experimental condition respondents are in.
Third, right after watching the video, they are asked to briefly describe the content of the
video using their own words. Fourth, they answer a series of questions related to their attitudes
towards inequality, opportunity, deservingness, and redistribution. Fifth, the respondents answer
a series of demographic questions, including their income and political orientation. Finally,
respondents answer questions that are specifically related to the coronavirus outbreak.​4

Implementation and subject recruitment
The survey experiment is implemented using Qualtrics. The videos presented to respondents as
part of the experiment are prepared using iMovie and subsequently uploaded to a YouTube
channel created by the researcher (videos are “unlisted”, have comments disabled, and show
subtitles by default). All videos showed an Adobe Stock licensed image in the background
related to the content of the narrated text. The experimental texts themselves are written by the
researcher after a careful reading of relevant news articles and scientific communications.

The texts narrated to respondents in the videos are recorded by a young female in her
20’s speaking Standard American English. Female voice is chosen over male voice due to
evidence that shows that people tend to find the female voice to be more credible (​Siegel,
Breazeal, and Norton 2009​). The narrated text is also displayed as actual text under the video in
case the respondent experiences a problem watching the video or chooses not to watch. (As
discussed later under Results, the researcher confirmed that most respondents watched and
understood the videos.)
Data collection took place on ​Lucid Theorem​. This platform gives researchers access to
cheap, fast (thousands of responses within hours), and high quality data that is also nationally
representative based on age, gender, ethnicity, and region. A recent scholarly work validated the
quality of Lucid samples (​Coppock and McClellan 2019​). The experiment is run on a total of
5,249 Lucid respondents with approximately 875 respondents in each condition. The conditions
appear to be balanced on the socio-demographic covariates, which gives us confidence that
randomization worked as expected.​5 All analyses are conducted on a dataset with the following
simple structure: one row per respondent and as many columns as there are variables.
Respondents are required to be US residents and 18 or older. The project has IRB approval. (All
code, materials, and de-identified data will be made public once the study is over.)

Measures
The study has a large number of outcomes that capture respondents’ opinions regarding
inequality, redistribution, and related concepts including opportunity, determinants of success,
and deservingness. Outcomes related to attitudes towards inequality are (i) whether the

respondent thinks income inequality is a serious problem; (ii) whether the respondent thinks
poverty is a serious problem; and (iii) whether the respondent thinks unequal access to healthcare
is a serious problem. All three of these outcomes are measured on a scale of 1 to 5 with higher
values denoting more seriousness.
The study also has outcomes that capture respondents’ preferences towards redistribution.
One set of outcomes asks respondents to report how effective they think certain tools are to
address inequality. The relevant outcomes here are (iv) whether the respondent thinks
government regulation is effective; (v) whether the respondent thinks government transfers are
effective; (vi) whether the respondent thinks progressive taxes are effective; (vii) whether the
respondent thinks education policies are effective; and (viii) whether the respondent thinks
private charity is effective. All three of these outcomes are measured on a scale of 1 to 5 with
higher values denoting more effectiveness.
Respondents are also asked (ix) whether they think the government should reduce
inequalities; (x) whether they think major companies should reduce inequalities; and (xi) who
they think has the greatest responsibility in reducing inequalities. The first two outcomes are
measured on a scale of 1 to 7 with higher values denoting more support for reducing income and
pay differences. The third variable is a forced choice question, which allows us to create separate
binary variables for: income differences do not need to be reduced; low income individuals
themselves; high income individuals themselves; private charity; major companies; and
government.
In addition to these outcomes directly related inequality and redistribution, the survey has
several outcomes that help us capture respondents’ opinions towards related concepts. The

opportunity outcomes are (xii) whether the respondent thinks Americans today have enough
opportunities (on a scale of 1-3) and (xiii) whether they think Americans today have more or less
opportunities compared to their parents (on a scale of 1-3). The main outcomes related to
determinants of success are (xiv) whether the respondent thinks hard work or luck is more
important for success (on a scale of 1-7) and (xv) whether they think people are poor because of
laziness or because of an unfair society (on a scale of 1-7). The study also has two deservingness
outcomes, which are (xvi) whether the respondent thinks high earners deserve their income
incomes (on a scale of 1-5) and (xvii) whether they think low earners deserve their low incomes
(on a scale of 1-5).
The main predictor in the study is the informational treatment. It can be thought of as a
single variable with six levels, or it can be viewed as the combination of two separate variables,
namely (1) whether the treatment relates to coronavirus or not, and (2) whether the treatment
provides any information about natural or class inequalities. In addition to the main predictor, the
survey includes a large number of socio-demographic covariates, including household income,
political orientation, level of education, gender, and race, among others.

Analytical strategy
The main statistical model fit to data is a linear regression of the outcome on the experimental
condition treated as a categorical variable with six levels. The general control condition is used
as the reference category to be able to get estimates for coronavirus and inequality conditions. In
other words, this model allows us to separately estimate effects associated with each of the five

non-control conditions. Estimates presented in Tables 3 and 4 are based on this model. The
general form of the model is described in Equation 1.

y = β 0 + β 1 cor_control + β 2 class + β 3 cor_class + β 4 natural + β 5 cor_natural + ε

(1)

In addition to this main model, separate models are fit when appropriate to estimate
effects associated with (i) receiving any kind of coronavirus information, that is, all three
coronavirus conditions viewed as a whole, and (ii) receiving any kind of information about
inequalities, that is, the two class inequality conditions and the two natural inequality conditions
viewed as wholes. Estimates presented in Table 2 are based on these models. The general form
of the models are described in Equations 2 and 3, respectively.

y = γ 0 + γ 1 coronavirus + ε

(2)

y = δ 0 + δ 1 class_ineq + δ 2 natural_ineq + ε

(3)

In the case of all three of these models, results both with and without socio-demographic
covariates are presented for the sake of transparency (​Lenz and Sahn 2020​). In general, given
that the independent variable is randomly assigned to respondents, the two results are very
similar.

Results

Does the informational treatment sensitize people to inequality?
Results show that respondents who received one of the coronavirus treatments were significantly
less likely to say that high earners deserve their high incomes (coefficient estimate = -0.077,
p-value = 0.002) (Table 2, ​high deserve​). On the other hand, no significant treatment effects were
observed with the outcome related to whether low earners deserve their low incomes (coefficient
estimate = -0.022, p-value = 0.425) (Table 2, ​low deserve)​ . While the effect sizes are
substantially small, these results suggest that the coronavirus treatments could have slightly
increased sensitivity towards inequality among respondents.
The class axis was also influential in moving people’s opinions towards inequality. In
particular, receiving one of the two class treatments made respondents significantly less likely to
say that income differences do not need to be reduced (coefficient estimate = -0.0341, p-value <
0.001) (Table 2, ​don’t reduce​). Once again, the substantive effect here is small (around 3-4%).
While the class treatments were able to slightly move attitudes towards income differences, no
significant effects are observed regarding support for government or major companies actually
reducing these income differences. In this case, the coefficient estimates are 0.018 (p-value =
0.792) for support for government reducing income differences (Table 2, ​govt reduce​) and 0.071
(p-value = 0.258) for major companies reducing pay differences (Table 2, ​comps reduce)​ . These
results suggest that while the class treatments were able to make people slightly more concerned
about inequality, they might not have been strong enough to move people’s opinions towards
redistribution.

Table 2 About Here

Overall, based on the results presented in this subsection, we have some evidence to
support ​Hypothesis 1a over ​Hypothesis 1b​. On the other hand, the evidence is not strong enough
to support either ​Hypothesis 2a or ​Hypothesis 2b​, but the former one seems more likely given the
direction in which the treatments moved preferences for reducing inequalities.

Does coronavirus amplify class effects?
Digging deeper into effects associated with each specific experimental condition showed that in
most instances the general class treatment was not strong enough to move respondents’ opinions,
while the coronavirus class treatment led to significant shifts in opinion. First of all, as far as
opportunity perceptions are concerned, the general class treatment failed to move either of the
two opportunity outcomes. The coefficient estimates here are -0.004 (p-value = 0.887) for the
enough opportunities question and -0.012 (p-value = 0.747) for the opportunities compared to the
parents question. On the other hand, in both of these instances, the coronavirus class inequality
conditions led to larger shifts in opinion, making respondents’ opportunity perceptions more
pessimistic. The corresponding coefficient estimates are -0.060 (p-value = 0.052) and (-0.089,
p-value = 0.024) (Table 3, ​enough opps,​ ​better opps​).
Similarly, the coronavirus class inequality condition moved respondents’ inequality
perceptions towards thinking that inequality is a serious problem, while the general class
inequality condition was generally not strong enough. In particular, the coefficient estimates for
inequality being a serious problem, poverty being a serious problem, and unequal access to

healthcare being a serious problem are 0.155 (p-value = 0.006), 0.127 (p-value = 0.012), and
0.164 (p-value = 0.003) for coronavirus class inequality, while the estimates are 0.136 (p-value =
0.016), 0.069 (p-value = 0.169), and 0.073 (p-value = 0.185) for general class inequality. It is
also important to note here that even the coronavirus control condition, which doesn’t explicitly
refer to inequality in any way, was able to significantly move respondents’ inequality
perceptions, with the corresponding coefficient estimates being 0.149 (p-value = 0.008), 0.119
(p-value = 0.018), and 0.134 (p-value = 0.016) (Table 3, ​ineq problem,​ ​povty problem​, ​hcare
problem​). These results suggest that coronavirus, with or without a direct reference to inequality,
made respondents more conscious of inequality.

Table 3 About Here

As far as opinions regarding concrete government tools to address inequality are
concerned, results show that receiving information about class inequality in the context of the
outbreak made respondents more likely to say that government transfers are effective (coefficient
estimate = 0.209, p-value < 0.001). There is also some indication of a similar effect for
government regulation being effective (coefficient estimate = 0.100, p-value = 0.081), while no
significant effects were observed for progressive taxes being effective (0.075, p-value = 0.183).
The general class inequality condition is not significant in either of these cases, with coefficient
estimates being 0.066 (p-value = 0.247), 0.088 (p-value = 0.125), and 0.011 (p-value = 0.843),
respectively (Table 4, ​transfers eff,​ ​regulation eff,​ ​prog taxes eff​).

On the other hand, both class inequality conditions lead to significant increases in
thinking that education policies and private charity are effective tools. In fact, the general class
inequality condition actually has stronger effects in these areas with coefficient estimates being
0.124 (p-value = 0.018) and 0.132 (p-value = 0.014) for general class inequality and 0.103
(p-value = 0.051) and 0.093 (0.086) for coronavirus class inequality (Table 4, ​educ pols eff,​ ​priv
charity eff)​ .

Table 4 About Here

Results presented in this subsection support ​Hypothesis 3a​. Furthermore, if we interpret
opinions regarding how effective certain tools are in addressing inequality to reflect preferences
for redistribution, ​Hypothesis 4a is supported as well. That said, the latter statement should be
interpreted with caution since, as the previous subsection showed, the treatments were generally
not strong enough to move preferences for reducing inequalities.

Discussion
It is known that Americans’ preferences for redistribution are generally not very elastic in
relation to their perceptions of inequality (​McCall 2013​, ​Kuziemko et al 2015​). Even localized
crises such as Hurricane Katrina that lay bare existing inequalities in society seem to do little to
nothing in moving public opinion on this matter (​Grusky and Ryo 2006​, ​Sweeney 2006​).
However, the coronavirus pandemic presents a new opportunity for social scientists and policy
experts to test whether large-scale national crises can lead to changes in people’s opinions. What

is the effect of discussing inequality in the context of coronavirus on Americans’ attitudes
towards inequality and redistribution?
The most interesting pattern observed in the results presented above is that being
informed about class inequalities ​in the context of the coronavirus outbreak tends to be much
more effective in moving people’s opinions compared to being informed about such inequalities
in general terms without reference to this extraordinary event. For example, while general
information about inequality has no statistically detectable effect on whether respondents think
unequal access to healthcare is a problem or not, information that explicitly connects inequality
to coronavirus makes respondents significantly more likely to think that unequal access to
healthcare is a serious problem.
Similarly, only when inequality is discussed in conjunction with the outbreak were the
informational treatment strong enough to move respondents’ opinions regarding whether
government transfers are an effective tool to address inequality. On the other hand, no matter
how the inequality information is presented -- with or without any reference to coronavirus -- the
experiment did not have any detectable effects on concrete opinions as to whether the
government, or major companies, should actually reduce income differences or not. This is
perhaps not surprising given how entrenched Americans’ redistributive preferences are.
Together, these findings suggest that the debate revolving around the coronavirus
outbreak, especially when connections to inequality were made explicit, could increase concern
about inequality among the public, and perhaps even shift opinions regarding specific
government tools to address inequality -- government transfers in particular -- even if opinions
regarding reducing inequalities remain entrenched. All of this implies that crisis times such as

this one could present fruitful opportunities for politicians and opinion leaders to reframe the
inequality debate in the country and get the message across to more Americans that inequality is
a problem.
This study helps answer important questions about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak
on the public’s attitudes towards inequality, but it also raises new ones. In particular, it is unclear
which of the effects observed in this study will persist over time. For example, it could simply be
that the observed effect on preferences towards government transfers is special to the given
situation when many people have been directly affected by the coronavirus stimulus checks. Will
the coronavirus outbreak lead to a long-term increase in the belief that government transfers are
effective? Even more fundamentally, will Americans maintain a higher level of concern for
inequality once the coronavirus situation goes back to normal, or will everyone simply revert
back to their old opinions? The answers to these questions will no doubt depend on how opinion
leaders end up framing the debate.

See ​Benabou and Ok (2001) and ​Cojocaru (2014) for more information on the influential “prospect of upward

mobility” (POUM) hypothesis.

Beyond perceptions of mobility, the actual mobility experience might also influence preferences for redistribution

through mechanisms such as upward mobility making an individual more effort-oriented and more likely to
subscribe to the idea that income and position need to be earned, not handed out by others (​Piketty 1995​). Note that
while there are several empirical findings related to mobility effects in the literature (​Alesina and La Ferrara 2005​,
Corneo and Gruner 2002​, ​Clark and D’Angelo 2009​, ​Siedler and Sonnenberg 2012​, ​Steele 2015​, ​Gugushvili 2018​,
Jaime-Castillo

and

Marques-Perales

2019​),

the

identification

problem

inherent

to

estimating

origin-destination-mobility effects, which is practically identical to the age-period-cohort identification problem,
makes this exercise very tricky (​Fosse and Pfeffer 2019​, ​Fosse and Winship 2019a​, ​Fosse and Winship 2019b​).

The two natural inequality conditions are included here for the sake of completeness since they were part of the

experiment that was run; however, results pertaining to them are not directly relevant to the main focus of this paper.

Appendix A: Experimental texts, images, videos, and other related content
Those interested in seeing how the survey looked like from the respondents’ perspective can take
the survey for themselves by going to this link [LINK REMOVED FOR BLIND REVIEW]. The
complete set of texts and figures as well as links to the videos used in the experiment are
provided below.
Many of the questions and text used in this survey are taken directly or adapted from
Kuziemko et al (2015) and ​McCall et al (2017)​. Other questions are based on existing survey
questions from the ​General Social Survey (GSS)​, ​World Values Survey (WVS)​, ​Polish Panel
Survey (POLPAN)​, or are written by the researcher.
Welcome to our survey!
The goal of this survey is to understand the public's opinions regarding important societal
and economic trends in the US.
At no point in the survey should you feel obligated to answer in a particular way; the most
important factor for the success of our research is that you ​answer honestly​. Anytime you
don’t know an answer, just give your best guess.
It is also very important for the success of our research project that you ​complete the
survey until the end​, once you have started. This survey should take (on average) about
10 to 15 minutes to complete.
Notes:
Your participation in this study is purely voluntary, and you may withdraw your participation or your data at any time without
any penalty to you. Your name will never be recorded. Results may include summary data, but you will never be identified. If

IF CONDITION = Control
The internet that many of us now take for granted came into existence less than forty
years ago. In fact, it did not start taking its familiar form as a collection of web pages
until thirty years ago. Since then, the internet has become an integral part of many
aspects of our lives, including information gathering, banking, and entertainment.

IF CONDITION = Natural inequality
Millions of Americans have serious medical conditions, including heart disease,
cancer, and diabetes. The risk of having a medical condition increases with age. In
addition, elderly people usually have weakened immune systems. While the elderly
are at greater risk, millions of younger Americans also suffer from these conditions.

IF CONDITION = Class inequality
Millions of Americans live in poverty. Many more make less than twice the poverty
threshold. The fraction of low-income households is higher among minorities such as
blacks and Hispanics. Low-income people face difficulties in many areas, including
food, housing, and healthcare, that high-income Americans take for granted.

IF CONDITION = Coronavirus control
We are in the midst of a global disease outbreak. Within a few months after its
emergence, the new coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread to almost every country on
earth, including the US. Very few events in history have impacted the entirety of
humanity in this way, regardless of sex, race, or cultural background.

IF CONDITION = Coronavirus natural inequality
The new coronavirus (COVID-19) is not affecting everyone in the same way. The
elderly and those with underlying medical conditions such as heart disease, cancer,
and diabetes have been disproportionately affected. The number of infections and
deaths are significantly higher among this group compared to the rest of the
population.

IF CONDITION = Coronavirus class inequality
The new coronavirus (COVID-19) is not affecting everyone in the same way. Poor
and low-income communities, particularly minorities such as blacks and Hispanics,
have been disproportionately affected. The number of infections and deaths are
significantly higher among this group compared to the rest of the population.

Appendix B: Sample size calculations and sample characteristics
Sample size calculations
Sample size calculations were made with the aim of being able to detect a small effect in
one-way ANOVA. The ​pwr.anova.test function in the ​R package ​pwr was used for this end.
Using this function, and assuming a small effect size (Cohen’s ​d = 0.05), a total of 5,200
respondents gives us more than 80% power to be able to detect the effect of interest. (Note that
Cohen’s ​d is defined as m
​ u/sigma​, where m
​ u is the raw effect size in the original scale and
sigma is the standard deviation of the outcome variable.) The specific function that was run was
this: p
​ wr.anova.test(k=6,f=0.05,sig.level=0.05,power=0.8)​.
