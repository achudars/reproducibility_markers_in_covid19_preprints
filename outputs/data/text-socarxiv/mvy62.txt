Abstract
Past evidence on fertility responses to external shocks, including economic recessions and the
outbreaks of infectious diseases, show that people often put their childbearing plans on hold in
uncertain times. We study the most recent data on monthly birth trends to analyse the initial fertility
responses to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our research, based on new Short-Term
Fertility Fluctuations (STFF) data series (https://www.humanfertility.org/cgi-bin/stff.php), embedded
in the Human Fertility Database (HFD), shows the initial signs of the expected “birth recession”.
Monthly number of births in many countries fell sharply between October 2020 and the most recent
month observed, often bringing about a clear reversal of the previous trend. Across 17 countries with
lower fluctuations in births, the number of births fell on average by 5.1% in November 2020, 6.5% in
December 2020 and 8.9% in January 2021 when compared with the same month of the previous
year. Spain sustained the sharpest drop in the number of births among the analysed countries, with
the number of births plummeting by 20% in December 2020 and January 2021. The combined effect
of rising mortality and falling birth rates is disrupting the balance of births and deaths in many
countries, pushing natural population increase to record low levels in 2020 and 2021.

This report presents results from the new Short-Term Fertility Fluctuations (STFF) data series
(https://www.humanfertility.org/cgi-bin/stff.php), embedded in the Human Fertility
Database (HFD).
The outbreak of COVID-19 was associated with an accelerated decline in the number of
births in most of the 22 analysed highly developed countries in November 2020 – January
2021.
Across 17 countries with lower fluctuations in reported births, the number of births fell on
average by 5.1% in November 2020, 6.5% in December 2020 and 8.9% in January 2021 when
compared with the same month of the previous year (January 2021 data are available only
for nine countries).
In 15 analysed countries of the European Union, the year-on-year number of births plunged
by 3.0% in October 2020, 5.0% in November 2020 and 8.1% in December 2020.
Similar downturn in births is observed in the United States, with year-on-year decline of 7.7%
in December 2020.
Births in Russia dropped by 10.3% in January 2021, whereas births in France were down by
13.5% in January 2021 when compared with January 2020.
Spain sustained the sharpest drop in the number of births among the analysed countries:
births plummeted by 20.4% in December 2020 and by 20.0% in January 2021.
There was no country with a sustained trend towards an increase in the number of births,
indicating that the COVID-19 pandemic has not led to a baby boom.
Births in Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, and Norway remained stable until December
2020 or January 2021, so far unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In Bulgaria, Slovenia,
and South Korea, the ongoing decline in the number of births during 2020 has continued
without further accelerating in the most recent months.
The decline in the number of births is likely to accelerate in the first months of 2021, with
record-low number of births and Total Fertility Rate expected in many countries in 2021.
A combination of increasing number of deaths and plunging number of births has negatively
affected natural population increase, leading to its sharp downturn in many countries.

1 Introduction

The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has profoundly affected every aspect of our lives,
including family-related behaviours (Settersen et al. 2020). Initially, attention to the demographic costs
of the pandemic was concentrated on deaths and excess mortality due to COVID-19. As data on births
in late 2020 and early 2021 become available for many countries, it is possible to get a first look at an
initial impact of the pandemic on births and fertility trends. Some early media accounts suggested that
the lockdowns may lead to a baby boom as couples spend more time together. However, past evidence
on fertility responses to external shocks, such as economic crises and financial turbulences (Sobotka
et al. 2011; Comolli 2017) as well as on the outbreaks of infectious diseases such as the Zika infection
in Latin America (Rangel et al. 2020; Marteleto et al. 2020) show that people often postpone or revise
their childbearing plans in uncertain times (Vignoli et al. 2020). These responses result in considerable
short-term fluctuations in fertility (e.g., Comolli and Vignoli 2021). Indeed, surveys on fertility
intentions in Europe and in the United States during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spring
2020 revealed that many women decided to delay or even give up their childbearing plans (Lindberg
et al. 2020; Luppi et al. 2020).
Especially in the highly developed countries, where couples have access to reliable birth control and
most women are employed, the pandemic is expected to depress fertility rates as many people
struggle with economic uncertainty, worries about the health consequences of the pandemic and
stress related to lockdowns and restrictions to everyday life (Aassve et al. 2020; Settersen et al. 2020;
Kearney and Levine 2020a). The pandemic has also affected reproductive behaviour in more subtle
ways: marriages were postponed, younger people and couples not living together had fewer
opportunities to meet, some couples reported less frequent sexual intercourse (Lehmiller et al. 2020
for the United States), families struggled to accommodate to home schooling and other needs of their
children staying at home, and contact with grandparents—important providers of childcare—was
often interrupted for many months. The actual impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on birth trends could
not be studied until recently. Considering time needed to get pregnant and the duration of pregnancy,
which is close to 9 months from ovulation to delivery (266 days or 8.7 months on average; Jukic et al.
2013), the onset of the pandemic in March 2020 would first affect births in November and December
2020.1
In the absence of actual data, Wilde et al. (2020) used data on Google searches for 40 fertility-related
keywords to predict short-term trends in the birth rates in the United States in the wake of the
pandemic. They projected that births would start dropping in November 2020 and this fall would
accelerate until February 2021, with about 15% fewer births expected compared to October 2020.
Outside the United States, media in many countries drew some evidence from hospital records and
preliminary, often local and small-sample, datasets, which reported fewer pregnancies and births in
the last months of the year. An early evidence mostly supported the notion that the COVID-19
pandemic would bring about a sharp decline in the number of births and pregnancies and the initial
speculations about possible baby boom have largely vanished, with many reports of the looming
COVID-19 “baby bust” (Pinsker 2020) and “baby crash” in 2021. Among the more systematic efforts to
analyse first data on birth trends, Philip N. Cohen (2021) reported a substantial decline in the number

This assumption excludes preterm births and the possibility that some women, who were pregnant at the time
of the COVID-19 outbreak, might have decided for an abortion in the early stage of the pandemic.

of births in some states of the United States in December 2020, reaching around 10% in Arizona,
California, Ohio and Florida.
Beaujouan (2021) argued that to properly research the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on population
trends we need to develop robust, cross-nationally comparative data sets. As first data on births in late
2020 and early 2021 became available, researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic
Research (Rostock, Germany) and Vienna Institute of Demography (Austrian Academy of Sciences,
Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital) developed a new data series on
trends in monthly number of births, the Short-Term Fertility Fluctuations (STFF) data series
(https://www.humanfertility.org/cgi-bin/stff.php), which is incorporated in the Human Fertility
Database (2021). This report gives a first overview on birth trends in the highly developed countries
covered by the STFF dataset, focusing on countries with available data until at least December 2020.
We focus especially on the dynamic of trends in the monthly number of births since October 2020 and
at the relative changes in the number of births compared with the same month in the preceding year.
Our report first provides a detailed picture of birth trends in East Asia, the United States, and in broader
European regions. Then we summarise the available evidence for the highly developed countries.
Overall, most of the evidence suggests that recent birth trends have been negatively affected by the
COVID-19 pandemic and many countries are likely to see their period fertility rates plummeting to
record-low levels in 2021.

2 Data and methods
Our report draws from the Short-Term Fertility Fluctuations data series launched on 12 March 2021
and embedded in the Human Fertility Database (HFD) website. The dataset features data on the
number of live births per month since January 2000 in highly developed countries with good quality of
vital registration data and almost complete coverage of births in their vital statistics. The main purpose
of the STFF data is to provide a timely information on the recent monthly trends in the number of
births, prior to the publication of more detailed final data on births and fertility rates, which are often
published with considerable delay. The STFF dataset is therefore especially suitable for studying birth
and fertility fluctuations that arise in response to external shocks—such as an outbreak of the COVID19 pandemic or economic shocks and turbulences—or in response to significant changes in familyrelated policies.
As of 12 March 2021, the STFF data series covers data for 32 countries, most of which has been
released and published by national statistical offices. In this report we focus on a subset of these data,
covering all countries for which data were available at least until December 2020, when the early
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on births conceived in March 2020 should have become clearly
visible. These data include ten countries with the birth data available until December 2020 (Austria,
Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Republic of Korea (hereafter South Korea), Latvia, Norway, Romania,
Ukraine and the United States), ten countries for which the data are available up until January 2021
(Croatia, Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary, Netherlands, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden) and two
countries with data reported until February 2021 (Lithuania and Taiwan). Altogether, we cover 19
European countries, two countries in East Asia (South Korea and Taiwan) and the United States (see
Appendix 1 for more details on the countries included in the STFF database and those covered in this
report).
There are considerable challenges when analysing monthly data on births. The first challenge concerns
data quality and definitions. Often, initial data that are reported within a few months are preliminary
and are subject to subsequent revisions and adjustments. These adjustments might eventually
4

increase the reported number of births in the most recent months, possibly turning what appears as
considerable fall in the number of births to a small blip in a few cases. In addition, some countries
report monthly birth data by month of registration rather than month of occurrence, which might be
an issue in times when data collection and reporting are disrupted, as was often the case during the
early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, monthly birth data for some countries suffer
substantial fluctuations, which might also affect birth numbers reported in the final month of the year,
when some of the late-reported births are added to the database. This factor probably explains a
sudden and unexpected spike in the number of births in December 2020 reported in some countries
with a “suspicious” time-limited sharp fall in the reported births in March-May 2020, including
Lithuania, Romania, Russia, Ukraine, and Taiwan (Appendix Figure AP-1). To filter out these
fluctuations, we exclude these countries from parts of our comparative analyses.2 Although we do not
have space to address country-specific data issues here, we strive to provide up-to-date information
on data definitions and data quality issues on the HFD website, specifically in the STFF Methodological
Note (https://www.humanfertility.org/DOCS/STFFNote.pdf) and in the STFF Metadata file that covers
data
definitions,
data
sources
and
data
issues
for
individual
countries
(https://www.humanfertility.org/DOCS/STFFmetadata.pdf).
The second challenge of working with monthly data pertains to the seasonality of births. In most
countries, births display a seasonal cycle during the year. While this seasonality often changes in time,
even contemporary societies with high levels of contraceptive use display a seasonal pattern of
conceptions and births (e.g., Régnier-Loilier and Divinagracia 2010; Dahlberg and Andersson, 2019).
Without filtering out the effects of seasonality as well as uneven length of calendar months and uneven
number of weekdays in different months, monthly birth trends cannot be simply compared between
adjacent months as most of these monthly fluctuations might be driven by these effects rather than
by genuine changes in reproductive behaviour. To address this issue, our analysis of birth dynamics
focuses on relating monthly number of births to the same month in the previous year rather than to
the preceding months.
The third issue pertaining to working with absolute numbers is well known to demographers: numbers
of births, deaths and other vital events are crude indicators that are not adjusted for the changing size
of population in a given country or region and its changing age and sex composition. Therefore,
numbers of births may change over time due to such compositional factors that are normally
controlled for in the standard demographic indicators, such as the Total Fertility Rate. Therefore, our
main focus is on relatively short period of time, during which changes in population size and
composition should have a relatively minor impact on the observed number of births.
In particular, our analysis puts a spotlight on changes in birth trends between October 2020—the last
month when births were relatively unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic as most were conceived
prior to March 2020—and, depending on data availability, December 2020 to February 2021. Our main
indicator of interest is the relative monthly change in the number of births compared to the same
month in the previous year and its dynamics in the observed period, including during the whole year
2020. As births often showed dynamic and often declining trajectory during the year 2020, observing
a relative decline in the number of births in the most recent period is not sufficient to suggest a
negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on births. As we show below, some countries, including
Lithuania, South Korea and Slovenia, displayed a stable trend of declining number of births throughout
the year 2020 and in January 2021, indicating that their downward fertility trend has not yet been
driven or accelerated by the pandemic. Therefore, only when the most recent trends are compared
2

In addition, data for two regions, Scotland and Northern Ireland, where births are reported by month of
registration, were not even included in the STFF data series as the reported number of births plummeted close
to zero during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in April-May 2020.

5

and contrasted with the “yardstick” of the birth trends prior to November 2020, it is possible to assess
an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on births.

3 Different birth trends across countries and regions
As we show below, birth “responses” to the COVID-19 pandemic differed widely across countries.
Often, countries in broader geographical regions displayed similar shifts and trends in time. This
section analyses data by broader regions, looking at the changes in East Asia, the United States,
Western Europe, Nordic countries, Southern Europe, Central Europe, Eastern Europe and SouthEastern Europe. We provide illustrations of birth trends in selected countries, with Appendix figures
giving more detailed evidence for many countries. Key findings are then summarised in the next
section.

3.1 East Asia
Birth data for South Korea and Taiwan depict a continuing downward trend throughout 2020. In South
Korea, this shift is a continuation of a long-standing fertility decline towards extreme low levels, which
until December 2020 does not appear to be further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure AP2 in Appendix and Figure 2).3 By contrast, data for Taiwan, which are available until February 2021,
show a steep fall in relative birth numbers in January-February 2021 peaking at 23% in January (Figure
1). Despite huge fluctuations in Taiwanese monthly birth data (Figure 2), this gives a signal of an
accelerated birth decline following the COVID-19 outbreak. Data for Japan are not yet available for the
whole year, but media reports based on pregnancies reported to local health authorities expect a
downward trend in the number of births (Ryall, 2020).

3

According to preliminary data the Total Fertility Rate in South Korea plunged to 0.84 birth per woman (Statistics
Korea, 2021), the record-low level in the country and the lowest level globally in 2020.

the United States. Five countries with unstable monthly data and a peak in December 2020 were excluded
(Lithuania, Romania, Russia, Taiwan and Ukraine).

3.2 United States
Multiple sources of data and information—including surveys of reproductive preferences (Lindberg et
al. 2020), surveys on sex lives (Lehmiller et al. 2020), data based on Google searches (Wilde et al. 2020),
initial evidence from selected states (Cohen 2021), diverse media accounts (Pinsker 2020), and expert
predictions (Kearney and Levine 2020)—all pointed in one direction: an expected downturn in births
in the United States resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Preliminary vital statistics data, available
for the period through December 2020, broadly conform this expectation: number of births has been
declining in late 2020 and this decline has been sharpest when compared with the 2019 figures (by
7

7.7%) in December 2020. This is in line with the predictions by Wilde et al. (2020). The only unexpected
feature of the birth decline in the United States is that it has been building up gradually throughout
the spring and summer months, i.e., before the COVID-19 pandemic could have impacted pregnancies
and births (Figure 3a). At the same time, the birth trend in the US followed relatively closely the
average trajectory of birth decline across 17 analysed countries (Figure 3b). If the expected future
impact of the COVID-19 materializes, US births will fall yet much deeper in the first months of 2021.

3.3. Western Europe
Except in the Netherlands, data on birth trends in three Western European countries—Austria, Belgium
and France—are broadly in line with the trajectory of births in the United States and with an average
trend across all analysed countries, showing an accelerated decline in the final months of 2020
(Austria, Belgium), which is further continuing in January 2021 (France). In these three countries, births
were down by 5.5% (Austria) to 7% (Belgium and France) in December 2020 when compared with
December 2019 and this fall deepened to 13.5% in France in January 2021 when compared with
January 2020 (Figures 4-6, Appendix Figure AP-3).
By contrast, data for the Netherlands show a stable level of births throughout 2020 and in January
2021, so far uninterrupted by the pandemic (Figure 6, Appendix Figure AP-3). This puts the country’s
experience close to that of several Nordic countries, which—with the exception of Sweden—did not
see any obvious pandemic baby bust until December 2020 or even January 2021 (see below). Possibly,
8

a yet sharper downturn in births might occur in Switzerland, where data available until November 2020
show a year-on-year fall in the number of births by 13.8% in that month (Appendix Table AP-2).

3.4. Nordic countries
In contrast to most of the Western European countries, Nordic countries have not recorded steep falls
in the number of births so far and the broader picture for the region seems to suggest no impact of
COVID-19 on fertility trends in the initial months until December (Figure 8). Two countries, Finland and
Sweden reported data until January 2021. Finland shows a continuation of a stable trend of a slight
increase in the number of births compared with the same period in the previous year, whereas Sweden
displays a clear downturn in births (-6.4%) starting in January (Figure 7). Denmark and Norway display
no clear trend until December, when both show a small uptick in the number of births compared with
December 2020 (Appendix Figure AP-2).

3.5 Southern Europe
The only Southern European country for which the birth data are currently available until at least
December 2020 is Spain. Preliminary birth trends in Spain until January 2021 reflect most closely the
idea of a sudden shock, a “baby crash” in response to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which hit
the country hard during its first wave in Spring. It further worsened the relatively challenging economic
and social conditions for childbearing and parenthood in the country (Adserà 2011; Barbieri et al.
2015). Compared with the same month in the previous year, the number of births fell by 6% in October
2020, by 11% in November, and then plummeted by 20.4% in December 2020 and by 20.0% in January
2021 (Figures 9a and 9b), the sharpest decline among the analysed countries (see also Figure 17
below). As a result of this sharp downturn in late 2020, births in the whole year 2020 fell by almost
10% and yet a steeper fall is likely to take place over the whole year 2021. An early evidence for Italy
suggests a similar sharp fall in births: in November 2020 (the latest available data), the number of births
was down by 8%, showing a clear acceleration compared with the previous months. Preliminary data
on births in 15 large Italian cities, comprising over 10% of the population in the country, show a fall in
the number of births by 8.2% in November (identical as the data for the whole country), accelerating
to 21.6% in December—almost the same value as in Spain (Blangiardo 2021).

3.6 Central Europe
We cover Central European countries together with the Baltic countries. Birth data for some of these
countries suffer considerable fluctuations, which introduce additional “noise” into the time series and
make the trends over time more difficult to interpret. Birth data for the three Baltic countries, Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania, as well as the data for Croatia, have displayed much higher instability than the
data for most other countries (Figure 11), with the exception of Taiwan and the countries of Eastern
and South-eastern Europe discussed below.
However, in most of the analysed countries, births have been falling after October 2020. The trend
reversal is most obvious in Hungary, where the number of births had been rising until November 2020,
possibly propelled in part by extensive pronatalist policies in the country (Makay 2019). The “surplus”
of births quickly melted away after October 2020, with the relative increase of +3% in October falling
over the next three months and reaching -9.8% in January 2021 (Figures 10 and 11). Data for Estonia
suggest that, despite fluctuations, birth trends turned sharply negative in December 2020 and January
2021, falling by 15% and 17%, respectively, when compared with the same month in the previous year
(Figure 10). Data for Croatia (Appendix Figure AP-3) and Latvia (Appendix Figure AP-2) also appear to
be heading downwards in December 2020 and January 2021 (only Croatian data available), but given
their fluctuations, only the data for more recent months will provide a more solid evidence to confirm
the downturn. By contrast, data for Slovenia (Figure AP-3) show that after a sharp drop in November
2020, births in December 2020 and January 2021 were falling by a similar pace as over most of the
year 2020, suggesting that the pandemic has not sped up the established trend. Recent Lithuanian data
also do not display any downward trend; the sharp upturn in December was probably due to delayed
registration of births that took place during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spring 2020,
when a notable dip in the number of reported births is apparent in the data (Figure 11).

3.7 Eastern and South-Eastern Europe
Among the four analysed countries, Bulgaria, Romania, Russia and Ukraine, the latter three suffer from
sharp fluctuations in the reported number of monthly births (Figure 13), similar to Lithuania and
several other countries in Central Europe discussed above. The peculiar pattern of seemingly
recovering birth trends in Romania is likely caused by a late registration of births that were “missing”
in Spring 2020, when the number of registered births plummeted by 21%-27% for four successive
months, from February to May (Appendix Figure AP-2). Similarly, the sharp peaks in births in Russia
and Ukraine in December 2020 (Figures 12 and 13) are probably linked to delayed reporting of births
that took place earlier in the year. Regional data for Russia indicate that the December peak has been
unevenly distributed across the country and that especially more remote and peripheral regions
reported the largest uptick in births; these include Far East region (+16%) and Northern Caucasus
region (+27%) (Rosstat 2021).
Only the data for Bulgaria display more stable pattern over the year 2020, with no change in the pace
of relative decline in the number of births in October-December 2020 (Appendix Figure AP-2). Among
the other three countries, only the data for Russia are available for January 2021, when births fell by
over 10% compared with January 2020 (Figure 12), the largest year-on-year fall since Summer 2019.
This indicates that fertility trends in Russia have been negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic,
but only the data for the subsequent months will show, whether this trend continues.

The emerging negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on birth trends: a summary

Our analysis of recent birth trends revealed considerable diversity between countries and regions. In
this section we summarise main findings across countries. First, we provide a summary picture of birth
trends across 17 countries, excluding those with high volatility in monthly births, especially in the most
recent period, including December 2020. Next, we summarise the evidence on regional and crosscountry differences. Then we provide additional analysis of most recent birth trends in the subset of
countries with the data available for January 2021.

4.1 Birth trends since January 2020
Figure 14 summarizes births trends from January 2020 until January 2021 across the analysed
countries, excluding five countries with unstable trends and with a spike in births reported in
December 2020. The average trend in relative year-on-year change in the number of births shows an
expected downturn after October 2020, first gradual and accelerating only in January 2021 (when data
for fewer countries are available). On average, births fell by 5.1% in October 2020, by 6.5% in December
2020 and by 8.9% in January 2021.4 The change from October to December 2020, while fitting the
expected trend, is not unusual when compared with the birth trends earlier in 2020. It is only in January
2021 when the birth decline appears to accelerate, with widening differences across countries: some
countries like Estonia, Spain and Taiwan see their birth rates plunge, while other countries like Finland
and the Netherlands do not show any significant change in birth trends.

4

The shift from December 2020 to January 2021 is not affected by the smaller number of countries covered in
January 2021: it remains almost identical, from -6.7% to -8.9%, when the average values for December 2020 are
computed only for these nine countries.

Note: The figure is based on data for all countries covered in this report except for five countries with unstable
trends in births (and with the December 2020 peak)— Lithuania, Romania, Russia, Taiwan, and Ukraine. The data
for January 2021 cover the following nine countries: Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Finland, France, the Netherlands,
Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden.

4.2 Regional and cross-country differences
Figure 15 summarizes changes in relative births in selected countries and regions. This is a preliminary
evidence, based on limited data past December 2020. When findings for broader regions are
considered, two main regional contrasts can be highlighted: Spain, the only country representing
Southern Europe in this report, shows the sharpest fall in the number of births across the analysed
countries and regions. By contrast, the Nordic countries display very limited changes in birth trends
until now. In between these two contrasting patterns, Western Europe, United States, and Central
Europe show an expected trend of accelerating birth declines. Russia displays an unstable (though
declining) pattern, also typical for some other countries in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe. Table 1
provides a more nuanced summary of regional and country trends, categorising birth trends across all
analysed countries into broader categories. This is a preliminary and simplified picture that will be
revised as more recent data (and for more countries) become available. The table puts twelve
countries, i.e., over a half of all analysed, into a category with discernible trend towards falling number
of births past October 2020. Among them, eight display an acceleration of the previous decline in the
number of births (United States, Taiwan, Belgium, France, Latvia, Russia, with further two countries,
Spain and Estonia, showing a sharp downward drift), three countries show a shift from relatively stable
to declining births (Austria, Croatia, Sweden) and Hungary displays a trend reversal from increasing to
declining births.
18

Seven countries display relatively stable trend past October 2020, either with relatively stable or
slightly rising births (Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway), or with a longer-term trend of
declining number of births established throughout 2020 (Bulgaria, Slovenia, South Korea). Finally,
monthly births in three countries, Lithuania, Romania, and Ukraine, have been too unstable to discern
a consistent trend.

4.3 Latest evidence: trends in January 2021
The analysis above revealed that a sharp downturn in the number of births is often observed only since
January 2021. Therefore, we provide an additional analysis of birth trends in twelve countries, for
which birth data are available for January 2021. When we select nine countries without December
spike, the data reveal a shift towards a stronger year-on-year decline (over 10%) in two countries in
November-December 2020 and in four countries in January 2021 (Figure 16). Figure 17 ranks all twelve
countries with available data by the pace of their birth decline in January 2021 compared with January
2020. This graph gives the clearest picture of the magnitude of recent birth declines: two countries
display a decline of 20-25% (Spain and Taiwan), further six show a fall in births by 10% to 17% and only
one, Finland, shows an increase in the number of births. The downward dynamics in birth trends is
apparent when contrasting the latest birth trends in January 2021 with those in January-September
2020, still reflecting pre-pandemic conceptions: eight countries show a clear downward shift in birth
trends and only four, Lithuania, Slovenia, the Netherlands, and Finland, show a similar birth dynamic
in both periods.

Concluding discussion: falls in fertility rates will lead to population decline in many countries

Broadly in line with the expected “birth recession” induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, monthly
number of births (as compared with the same month in the previous year) in many countries fell
sharply between October 2020 and the most recent month observed, often bringing about a clear
reversal of the previous trend. Remarkably, there was no single country reporting a sustained increase
in births in the analysed period, which suggests that some earlier media speculations and popular
21

imagination about covid-driven baby boom were misplaced. In some countries, including Bulgaria,
Netherlands, Finland, Norway, and Slovenia, birth trends remained flat in the wake of the pandemic.
Our analysis is based on preliminary data and reflects the pregnancies started in the initial months of
the pandemic. Therefore, we reiterate the often stated “mantra” that more data are needed to provide
a more solid evidence on the emerging fertility downturns.
Most countries with available data for January 2021, reflecting pregnancies started in April and early
May 2020, show a deepening baby bust. If the drop in the number of births suggested by the data for
January 2021 prevails over the next months, many of the analysed countries will experience a fall in
fertility rates to extreme low levels, often reaching the lowest level on record. A wider “return” of
“lowest-low fertility” (a Total Fertility Rate at or below 1.3), which had been prevalent in many rich
countries in the late 1990s and early 2000s (Goldstein et al. 2009) is likely across Europe and East Asia.
Italy, Spain and Taiwan are likely to see their period Total Fertility Rate plunging to or below 1. In the
United States, the TFR may fall below 1.5, a record low, and in Russia it may drop to around 1.3.
The downturn in the number of births will also have a strong impact on short-term population trends.
The combined effect of rising mortality and falling birth rates in the wake of the pandemic will disrupt
the balance of births and deaths in many countries. Often, these effects are already visible in 2020
(Figure 18). As a result, some countries, including Austria and Belgium, saw their initially positive
balance of births and deaths turn negative. Countries with initially higher fertility, like France and the
United States, saw their positive natural population growth plummet in 2020. Finally, countries with a
negative natural population balance, including Russia and Spain, saw the gap between the number of
births and deaths widening further.
As the COVID-19 pandemic continued strongly affecting most of the highly developed countries, with
the second wave hitting in October-December 2020, and as the new peaks in the reported cases were
often reached in the first three months of 2021, the pandemic will cast a long shadow on birth trends
throughout the whole year 2021 and probably beyond. This may push natural population increase to
yet lower levels. In the next 35 years, economic and labour market uncertainty are likely to continue
exerting negative pressure on fertility plans, even if the waves of infection eventually subside. This
implies that different scenarios of post-pandemic fertility recovery (e.g., Goldstein 2020), especially of
a rapid V-shaped baby boom, are unlikely to materialise soon. This is especially true in countries with
weaker family policies, more disadvantaged position of young adults, higher gender inequalities,
deeper economic recession and dysfunctional labour market, including Southern Europe and much of
Eastern and South-Eastern Europe.
