ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic closed schools and childcare centers across the U.S., forcing many
parents to care for children at home. While parents generally enjoy time with children and want
more “family time,” evidence also suggests that substantial, unanticipated increases in parenting time
may negatively impact at least some mothers’ well-being. We investigate this possibility using surveys
(N=139) and in-depth interviews (N=65) with mothers of young children in Southern Indiana
conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic (April-May 2020). We find that mothers who have
greatly increased the time they spend caring for their children also disproportionately report
increased stress, anxiety, and frustrations with their children. Our qualitative data reveal that
disruptions in childcare arrangements, particularly when coupled with intensive work and/or
intensive parenting pressures, exacerbate the negative impact of increased parenting time on
mothers’ well-being. Meanwhile, other mothers (including mothers with undisrupted childcare,
mothers facing less intensive pressures, and some mothers who lost jobs) have experienced
increased parenting time as a source of joy in otherwise difficult times. We discuss the implications
of these findings for research on mothers’ health and labor force participation, for children’s health
and well-being, and for policies to support families during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

INTRODUCTION
As the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the U.S., schools and childcare centers abruptly
closed, forcing many parents to spend more time caring for their children at home (Carlson, Petts,
and Pepin 2020; Collins et al. 2020; Krentz et al. 2020; Landivar et al. 2020). Given prior research on
the benefits of “family time” (Flood, Meier, and Musick 2020; Meier et al. 2016; Milkie et al. 2004;
Milkie, Nomaguchi, and Schieman 2019; Musick, Meier, and Flood 2016; Offer 2014), we might
anticipate that pandemic-related increases in parents’ time with children would improve parents’
well-being. That said, and given the stress of balancing paid work and parenting in a country with
weak family support policies (Christopher 2012; Collins 2019; Damaske 2011; Dow 2019; Gerson
1985; Glass, Simon, and Andersson 2016; Nomaguchi and Milkie 2003) there is reason to suspect
that some parents may experience substantial, unanticipated increases in their time with children as
detrimental to their well-being.
Using a mixed-methods study involving surveys (N=139) and in-depth interviews (N=65) with
Southern Indiana mothers with young children, we examine how increases in parenting time are
related to changes in mothers’ stress, anxiety, and frustrations with their children. We then identify
factors that exacerbate or alleviate the impact of pandemic parenting on mothers’ well-being.
Specifically, we consider the possibility that disruptions in mothers’ childcare arrangements,
particularly when coupled with intensive work pressures and/or intensive parenting norms, will
intensify the negative impact of increased parenting time.
This study offers important insights for researchers and policymakers. Given that mothers’
stress, anxieties, and frustrations have consequences not only for their own health (Pearlin et al.
2005; Read and Gorman 2010) but also for their children’s health, relationships, behavior, and
school outcomes (Augustine and Crosnoe 2010; Morgan, Shaw, and Forbes 2014; Turney 2011,
2012), it is critical to understand how unanticipated increases in parenting time are influencing
mothers’ well-being. By examining these processes, this study has the potential to inform policy
interventions aimed at alleviating mothers’ stress, anxiety, and frustrations with their children and
better supporting families through difficult times.

BACKGROUND
COVID-19 and Parents’ Time with Children
The COVID-19 upended normal paid work and parenting routines, leading many parents to
spend more time with their children (Carlson et al. 2020; Krentz et al. 2020). Some of these changes
reflected disruptions in childcare and children’s schooling. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, about
60% of young children regularly received childcare from a preschool, childcare center, home
daycare, extended family member, babysitter, or nanny, and schools were the primary source of
daytime supervision for older children (Modestino, Ladge, and Lincoln 2020). In light of pandemicrelated childcare disruptions, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act mandated extended
family and medical leave for ten weeks (Modestino et al. 2020). And yet, many schools and
childcares remained closed much longer, forcing many parents to find alternative childcare

2

arrangements or assume primary supervision of their children (Garbe et al. 2020; U.S. Department
of Labor 2020).
Disruptions in paid work also led many parents to spend more time at home. Following stay-athome orders, some workers were allowed to work remotely (especially highly educated
professionals), while others were left furloughed or unemployed (especially in the retail and service
sectors) (Dey et al. 2020; Lyttelton, Zang, and Musick 2020).
These disruptions appear to be taking a heavy toll on parents, especially mothers. Many mothers
are reducing their paid work hours (Collins et al. 2020; Landivar et al. 2020). Meanwhile,
telecommuting mothers are also reporting increased anxiety, loneliness, and depression (Lyttelton et
al. 2020). Such findings raise important questions about how mothers are experiencing pandemicrelated increases in time with their children. Focusing specifically on mothers, we ask:
1. Which mothers have increased the time they spend caring for their children?
2. How is increased time with children related to changes in mothers’ well-being?
3. What factors exacerbate or alleviate the impact of increased time with children on mothers’
well-being?
While prior research has not explicitly answered these questions, it does offer insights into what we
might find.

The Potential Benefits and Drawbacks of Increased Time with Children
Given prior research on the benefits of “family time,” we might anticipate that pandemicrelated increases in parenting responsibilities will positively influence mothers’ well-being. For
parents, spending time with children is generally an enjoyable activity associated with high levels of
well-being (Flood et al. 2020; Meier et al. 2016; Musick et al. 2016; Nelson et al. 2013; Offer 2014).
As a result, many parents (including roughly half of employed parents) want to spend more time
with their children (Milkie et al. 2004, 2019). Based on these findings, we might anticipate that
pandemic-related increases in parenting time would be beneficial for parents’ well-being. Those
benefits, however, may not be automatic or equally distributed.
Instead, research on the stresses of parenthood suggests that increased parenting time will be
detrimental to at least some mothers’ well-being. Parents (especially unpartnered parents) have
higher rates of depression and anxiety than non-parents, reflecting the time constraints and
economic costs parents face (Evenson and Simon 2016; McLanahan and Adams 1987). Mothers also
benefit less than fathers from time with children and experience parenting time as more stressful
than fathers do (Damaske, Smyth, and Zawadzki 2014; Musick et al. 2016). This reflects the fact
mothers do more “routine childcare” (Bianchi et al. 2012; Bittman et al. 2003; Ciciolla and Luthar
2019; Craig and Mullan 2011; Daminger 2019; Musick et al. 2016; Sayer, Bianchi, and Robinson
2004). Childcare is less enjoyable than others parenting activities (Craig and Brown 2017; Musick et
al. 2016; Offer 2014) and, when unequally distributed, is a key source of stress for mothers (Ciciolla
and Luthar 2019). Building on these findings, we can consider how the increased time demands of
pandemic parenting may have negatively impacted mothers’ well-being.

3

Pandemic-Related Disruptions and the Consequences of Increased Time with Children
First, increased time with children may have been detrimental for mothers whose access to
childcare (either through schools, centers, babysitters/nannies, or family members) was disrupted by
the pandemic. The U.S. lags far behind other countries in ensuring universal access to affordable
childcare (Collins 2019; Glass et al. 2016). Affordable childcare is critical for mothers’ employment
(Cascio and Schanzenbach 2013; Collins 2019; Hofferth 1999; Ruppanner, Moller, and Sayer 2019;
Steiber and Haas 2012) and beneficial for mothers’ well-being (Glass et al. 2016). Thus, mothers
experiencing childcare-disruption-related increases in time with children likely experienced increased
stress, anxiety, and frustration with children.
Second, increased time with children may have been particularly detrimental for mothers
engaging in “intensive” work while caring for their children at home. Pre-pandemic, many U.S.
mothers were already struggling to balance parenting and paid work (Christopher 2012; Collins
2019; Damaske 2011; Gerson 1985; Glass and Estes 1997; Nomaguchi and Milkie 2003; Stone
2007). Remote work is generally thought to facilitate that balance (Munsch 2016). Nevertheless,
pandemic research shows that telecommuting mothers experienced heightened anxiety, loneliness,
and depression (Lyttelton et al. 2020). This may be because pandemic-related shifts to remote work
were most common in professional and managerial jobs (Dey et al. 2020; Lyttelton et al. 2020).
These jobs require high levels of commitment (Clarkberg and Moen 2016; Glass and Estes 1997).
Such commitments create considerable stress and time pressures for workers (Craig and Brown
2017; Damaske 2011; Kleiner 2014; Milkie et al. 2004, 2019; Ruppanner, Perales, and Baxter 2019),
increase work-family conflict (Clarkberg and Moen 2016; Glass and Estes 1997), and push some
mothers to scale back their work or opt out of the workforce entirely (Becker and Moen 1999; Cha
2010; Stone 2007). If mothers are attempting to engage in this type of intensive work without
childcare, the time pressures and stresses are likely to be even more pronounced.
Third, increased time with children may also be particularly detrimental for mothers who hold
themselves to the standards of “intensive” parenting, even while weathering substantial disruptions
to their normal parenting routines. Mothers in the U.S. face pressure to engage in “intensive”
parenting (Bianchi et al. 2012; Hays 1998; Ishizuka 2018; Lareau 2011; Milkie and Warner 2014),
which is “child-centered, expert-guided, emotionally absorbing, labor intensive, and financially
expensive” (Hays 1998: 8). Many U.S. mothers also blame themselves if they struggle to parent
intensively, either because of paid work responsibilities or because of limited financial resources
(Christopher 2012; Collins 2019; Damaske 2011; Elliott, Powell, and Brenton 2015; Romagnoli and
Wall 2012). As a result, mothers who ascribe to intensive mothering ideologies and mothers who
struggle to meet the demands of intensive mothering also report higher levels of anxiety and stress
(Henderson, Harmon, and Newman 2016; Rizzo, Schiffrin, and Liss 2013). During the pandemic,
mothers who have lost access to childcare (through schools, centers, or individual care providers)
may find it especially difficult to maintain the high standards of intensive parenting and may
therefore experience increased time with their children as detrimental to their well-being.
Fourth, mothers whose employment has been disrupted by the pandemic may also be
experiencing increased time with their children, and they may also be experiencing increased stress.

4

For these mothers, however, the relationship between changes in parenting time and well-being may
be less straightforward. Unemployment creates tremendous stress for families, especially if families
are struggling to make ends meet (Pugh 2015; Rao 2020; Villalobos 2014). Women, however,
respond to unemployment (their own or their partner’s) by taking on more housework and childcare
and focusing on their relationships with their children (Pugh 2015; Rao 2020; Villalobos 2014). Such
findings suggest that while unemployment is likely to be a serious source of stress for mothers, some
unemployed mothers may experience the resulting increases in time with children as a silver lining to
their loss of paid work. That more positive experience, however, may be more common among
mothers who feel financially secure despite disruptions to their employment, either because they
have a partner whose salary provides sufficient income or because they are receiving support from
the government (like the payments provided to families and unemployed workers through the
CARES Act) that is sufficient to make ends meet.
Of course, it is important to note that parenting roles, norms, pressures, and disruptions may be
experienced differently by mothers from different racial and ethnic groups as well as by mothers
from different socioeconomic backgrounds (Collins 2005; Damaske 2011; Dow 2019; Elliott et al.
2015; Pugh 2015; Villalobos 2014). Research on middle- and upper-middle-class Black mothers, for
example, finds that these mothers often resist hegemonic ideas about motherhood and experience
their roles as workers and caregivers as more integrated than do white mothers (Blair-Loy and
Dehart 2003; Dow 2016, 2019). Research also shows that lower-income mothers and mothers of
color tend be more embedded in extended kin networks, which help mothers with childcare and
other forms of support (Dow 2016, 2019; Gerstel 2011; Lareau 2011; Sarkisian and Gerstel 2004).
Despite these potential variations, however, evidence suggests that unanticipated increases in
time with children may be harmful to at least some mothers’ well-being. Specifically, we anticipate
that unanticipated increases in time with children may be detrimental for mothers experiencing
disruptions in childcare, particularly when coupled with intensive work pressures and/or pressure to
follow intensive parenting norms.

METHODS
Data Sources and Samples
Our data come from Wave 1 of the Pandemic Parenting Study (PPS), a novel mixed-methods
longitudinal study conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The PPS builds off a pre-pandemic
study of mothers of young children, the Social Networks and Parenting Study (SNAP). SNAP began
in 2018, recruiting pregnant women through prenatal clinics in Monroe County, Indiana and
following them from pregnancy for two years postpartum (N=250). All mothers from the SNAP
study were invited to participate in the PPS, though a few are no longer living in Southern Indiana.
We use two types of data from PPS Wave 1: surveys and in-depth interviews. All mothers
included in our analyses completed the survey; some also completed interviews. Participants received
payments for each part. 139 mothers completed the Wave 1 survey, which was fielded between April
1 and April 15, 2020 and asked mothers about their experiences during the pandemic and the impact
of the pandemic on their day-to-day lives, including employment, childcare, relationships, routines,

5

decision-making, and well-being. In-depth interviews with 65 mothers were conducted from April
15 through May 7, 2020 and asked mothers to discuss in more depths their experiences, challenges,
and coping strategies during the pandemic.
Data collection began in the early stages of COVID-19’s spread across the U.S., when there had
been only 30 confirmed cases in Monroe County (Indiana State Department of Health, 2020). At the
time, however, Indiana’s residents were already subject to stay-at-home orders, which remained in
place until just before our last week of interviews (Chapman, 2020). As a result, businesses and
services (including childcare centers) were closed as we conducted our research, and local schools
were implementing remote learning (Thompson, 2020). While variations in state and local policies
make it difficult to describe an “average” policy response to the pandemic, Indiana’s policies do not
appear notably different from other nearby states’ (Moreland, 2020).

Dependent Variables. Our quantitative dependent variables measure changes in mothers’ wellbeing during the pandemic. To measures change in stress, we asked: “Compared to how much stress
you felt before the COVID-19/Coronavirus pandemic, how is your stress level now?” For anxiety,
we asked: “Compared to how often you felt worried or anxious before the COVID19/Coronavirus
pandemic, how often do you feel worried or anxious now?” And for mothers’ frustrations with their
children, we asked: “Compared to how often you felt frustrated with your child(ren) before the
COVID-19/Coronavirus pandemic, how often do you feel frustrated with your child(ren) now?”
With each of these questions, mothers had five possible responses ranging from much more to
much less than pre-pandemic.
Independent Variables. Our key independent variables include measures of changes in mothers’
time with their children and measures of pandemic-related disruptions in mothers’ employment and
childcare that might produces those changes in time. To measure changes in mothers’ parenting
time, we use the question “How, if at all, has the Coronavirus pandemic affected the amount of time
you spend caring for your children?” Mothers could indicate that they are spending a great deal
more time, somewhat more time, the same amount of time, somewhat less time, or a great deal less
time caring for their children than they were before the pandemic.
To measure paid work disruptions, we asked how the pandemic has affected mothers’ paid
work and income and whether they have worked remotely during the pandemic. We recode these
answers into five categories: 1) employed, same income, working remotely; 2) employed, same
income, not able to work remotely, 3) employed, income reduced because of the pandemic (e.g.,
furloughed or hours reduced), 4) unemployed, and 5) stay-at-home parent (pre-pandemic). Due to
small cell sizes, we do not differentiate between remote and non-remote workers among those who
are still employed but whose incomes have been reduced during the pandemic.
To measure childcare disruptions, we asked whether mothers had children attending school or
receiving childcare pre-pandemic and whether their children were attending school or receiving
childcare during the pandemic. We recode these responses into two categories: 1) childcare not
disrupted (no loss of care), and 2) childcare disrupted (loss of care).

Data Analysis
Quantitative Analysis. Using mothers’ responses to Wave 1 survey questions, we first examined
which mothers have increased the time they are spending caring for their children, focusing on
differences related to disruptions in mothers’ employment and childcare. Next, we examined how
increased time with children is associated with changes in mothers’ stress, anxiety, and frustrations
with their children. Given the sample size, we present a series of crosstabulations identifying the
proportions of mothers reporting each level of frustration. For some key comparisons, we also
calculated and present z-scores to test the statistical significance of differences between groups.
Qualitative Analysis. Using our interview data, we ask why increases in mothers’ time with
children influence mothers’ well-being and what factors may exacerbate or alleviate that influence.
We coded transcripts using Excel. Each respondent represented a row in the spreadsheet. While
reading each transcript, we entered codes in the spreadsheet for the presence/absence of relevant
themes (e.g., frustration with increased parenting time, enjoyment of increased parenting time,
frustrations with lack of childcare, frustrations with remote work, frustrations with remote learning).
We also included relevant portions of each transcript in the spreadsheet to illustrate coded themes.
After coding the transcripts, we then sorted coded entries by disruptions in childcare and paid work
arrangements. We then reread the grouped, coded entries and wrote memos describing the patterns,
illustrating those patterns with examples, and discussing key exceptions to the patterns.

Sample
Our sample includes all mothers who participated in the PPS Wave 1 Survey (N=134). Some of
these mothers also participated in in-depth interviews (N=65). Demographic data for the Wave 1
PPS participants are included in Table 1.

PPS demographics are consistent with those of Southern Indiana, where initial recruitment took
place (U.S. Census Bureau, 2019). Monroe county is roughly 83% white, non-Hispanic; surrounding
counties, where some respondents live, are up to 95% white, non-Hispanic. 46% of Monroe County
residents ages 25 and over have at least a Bachelor’s degree, and 60% of women ages 16 and over
are in the labor force. 21% of Monroe County residents live in poverty, and the median household
income (in 2018 dollars) is $47,075. Monroe County is home to Indiana University, with other major
industries including healthcare, medical device manufacturing, military, and mining. While the PPS is
not representative of the U.S. population, its mixed methods data and its focus on mothers with
young children makes it useful for understanding how some mothers are experiencing increased
time with children and for identifying key factors that may exacerbate or alleviate the influence of
that added time on mothers’ well-being.

CHANGING TIME WITH CHILDREN IN THE WAKE OF COVID-19
In our sample, 42% of mothers reported spending a great deal more time with their children
during the pandemic than pre-pandemic, 25% reported spending somewhat more time, and only 2%
reported spending less time. These changes appear to be driven, at least in part, by disruptions in
mothers’ paid work and childcare arrangements. Looking first at mothers whose incomes were not
disrupted and who were able to work remotely during the pandemic, and as shown in Table 2, we
see that the proportion reporting greatly increased time with children is significantly larger (p<.05)
among those whose childcare arrangements were disrupted (85%) than among those whose
childcare arrangements were not disrupted (50%). Similarly, among stay-at-home mothers, the
proportion reporting greatly increased time with children is significantly larger (p<.05) among those
whose childcare arrangements were disrupted (33%) than among those whose arrangements were
not disrupted (7%). Regardless of care disruptions, a large proportion of unemployed mothers
reported greatly increased time with their children (55%). Similarly, and regardless of care
disruptions, a large proportion of employed mothers whose incomes were disrupted (e.g., because of
furloughs or reduced work hours) reported greatly increased time with children (52%). Meanwhile,
among mothers whose incomes were not disrupted and who have not been able to work remotely,
only a small proportion reported greatly increased time (9%). Taken together, these patterns suggest
that mothers whose childcare arrangements were disrupted by the pandemic are now spending a
great deal more time with their children, especially if they were also working remotely or spending
more time at home because of unemployment or reduced work hours.

CHANGING TIME WITH CHILDREN AND MOTHERS’ WELL-BEING
Having established that the pandemic led many mothers to spend a great deal more time with
their children, we consider how these unanticipated increases in parenting time may have impacted
mothers’ well-being.
As shown in Table 3, mothers experiencing increased time with children disproportionately
report increased stress. The proportion of mothers reporting much more stress during the pandemic
is significantly greater among mothers spending a great deal more time with their children during the
pandemic than among mothers whose time with children was unchanged (42% vs. 16%; p<.05). The
same is true for mothers spending somewhat more time with their children (36% vs. 16%; p<.05).

We find similar patterns with respect to mothers’ anxiety. As shown in Table 4, the proportion
of mothers experiencing much more anxiety is moderately significantly greater among mothers
spending a great deal more time with their children than among mothers whose time with children
was unchanged (36% vs 18%; p<.10).

We also find similar patterns with respect to mothers’ frustrations with their children. As shown
in Table 5, the proportion of mothers experiencing much more frustration with their children is
significantly greater among mothers spending a great deal more time parenting than among mothers
whose parenting time was unchanged (11% vs. 0%; p<.05). More broadly, the proportion of
mothers reporting any increase in frustration with their children is significantly higher among
mothers who spending more time parenting (either a great deal or somewhat more) than among
mothers whose parenting time was unchanged (50% vs. 27%; p<.05).

HOW CHILDCARE DISRUPTIONS AMPLIFY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF INCREASED PARENTING TIME
Building on these quantitative findings, our qualitative data reveal that childcare disruptions
amplified the negative impact of increased parenting time. This was especially true for mothers
whose disrupted childcare arrangements were coupled with intensive work pressures and/or
pressure to follow intensive parenting norms.

“I'm not doing a good job of either”: Working Remotely without Childcare
In the wake of the pandemic, some mothers in our study were pushed into telecommuting
without childcare. Consistent with national trends (Dey et al. 2020; Lyttelton et al. 2020), these were
primarily highly educated mothers in professional or managerial roles. Thus, these mothers also
faced pressures to demonstrate high levels of commitment to their jobs (Clarkberg and Moen 2016;
Glass and Estes 1997) and also typically held themselves to intensive parenting standards (Collins
2019; Damaske 2011; Gerson 1985; Hays 1998; Lareau 2011).
For these mothers, increased parenting time was often a tremendous source of stress and
anxiety. Gina (white, advanced degree) works full-time in university administration and her husband
(white, bachelor’s degree) is a teacher. Both Gina and her husband worked remotely during the
pandemic while caring for their 17-month-old daughter, whose childcare center closed. Asked what
the biggest challenges were for her during the pandemic, Gina pointed to the challenges of balancing
paid work with parenting:
I think that's been the hardest thing, is just suddenly feeling I'm not getting any work
done. Somehow I'm not getting any work done, but also [my daughter] is not getting
the best mothering she could be getting. It's like wait a second. Where did all that

12

energy go, if it's not going into work and not going into her? All of a sudden I’m not
doing a good job of either.
Gina went on to describe the toll that this sense of failure has taken on her well-being, noting:
[My mother-in-law] is very much a “Oh, you have to cherish these special times.”
And it’s like, okay, but let’s not pretend it’s fun... Our lives, the quality of all three of
our lives would get better if daycare opened.
Mothers like Gina, who were pushed into telecommuting without childcare, often described feeling
as though they were failing at both work and motherhood. They also worried about how those
failures might impact their children’s well-being. As a result, these mothers tended to experience
increased time with children as a source of stress, not a source of joy.
For mothers pushed into telecommuting without childcare, increased parenting time also led to
increased frustration with their children. Erica (white, advanced degree) works part-time as a
computer scientist, and her husband (white, bachelor’s degree) is a full-time office manager. They
both telecommuted during the pandemic, with Erica also providing care for their first-grader,
preschooler, and toddler whose schools and childcare centers closed. As Erica explained:
My husband’s job is very demanding, and they talk a lot about flexibility, but at the
end of the day if [his boss] sets a meeting, he sets a meeting. You can’t not go, even
during a pandemic, if you want to keep your job…. [So] it’s primarily me.
Although she only worked two hours a day during the pandemic, being the primary caregiver made
it difficult for Erica work:
Those two hours [a day], my [one-year-old] son is into everything. He climbs, so
you’re up and down and up and down, and he’s really fast. So, today I was nursing
him and trying to read something at the desk, and he swung his leg, and it somehow
landed in my tea, and it kicked the teacup over. Tea all over both of us, all over the
desk, all over the chair, all over the wall, and then he bit me at the same time because
I went “Ahh!” when he [kicked the cup]… And then I had to get us both cleaned up,
clean up everything and then keep nursing him. So, definitely those two hours, they
feel like an eternity.
For Erica, pandemic parenting also led to more frustrations with her children:
I think I’ve definitely been the one that’s been more frustrated and a little less patient
with the kids. I know they get up early, so by 8:00, that’s hour 13 nonstop
togetherness, and I think at that point I’m done.... I feel like my patience with the
kids, there’s been days where it’s really good and days when it just hasn’t been great
at all, and I just feel like oh my gosh, I can’t believe we have to do this for how many
more months. It’s that every day the house gets destroyed, toys everywhere, and
then we’ve got to clean it all up.
Reflecting on why she has been so frustrated, Erica added:

13

Doing it without childcare is really hard, even if it’s just part-time…. I can’t imagine
the families where both parents are working fulltime, and the kids are at home. The
kids just must be so bored and the parents so frustrated. It’s a hard time and so hard
on working parents.
During the pandemic, families like Erica’s faced intensive work demands that made it difficult to
combine telecommuting with full-time caregiving, and those difficulties often led to increased
frustration with children.
For mothers pushed into telecommuting without childcare, increased parenting time also led to
guilt. Laura (white, advanced degree) works full-time in marketing, and her husband (Hispanic,
bachelor’s degree) is a PhD student and instructor. They have a six-year-old, a three-year-old, and a
one-year-old whose schools and childcare center closed. Asked about the biggest challenges she has
faced during the pandemic, Laura noted: “The biggest thing really is just trying to work from home
with kids.” Elaborating, she explained:
It’s a day by day thing, trying to get it figured out, having to work in the evenings, on
the weekends. I mean, it definitely does stink. On the one hand, it’s kind of fun
being home and being around the kids more often, but yeah, like I said, it’s tough.
You use childcare for a reason so that you can get things done. I don’t know. It’s
just difficult. It is difficult to get it figured out. I mean, maybe you feel like you’re a
little bit less patient or that you have to do a little bit more of compartmentalizing
your time, I guess, to be able to get your work done. You kind of have to send kids
off to do their own thing more often than you would want, but that’s the thing
though. As parents, you always feel guilt about when you’re with your kids, not
spending time with them, doing stuff with them.
Like Laura, many mothers pushed into working from home without childcare felt guilty both for
being “less patient” with their children and for not spending more time actively engaging with their
children at home.
To alleviate their guilt, some mothers telecommuting without childcare tried to plan fun-filled
activities for their kids. In many cases, however, those extra activities became a source of stress in
themselves. Vanessa (white, advanced degree), who was working from home as a mental health
counselor while caring for her one-year-old daughter, noted: “I would love to just take [my one-yearold daughter] out of the house and go do something fun, instead of trying to Pinterest all of these
ideas, and they’re always epic fails.” While mothers like Vanessa wanted to enjoy the added time they
were spending with their children, the pressure they felt to make that time fun and engaging
ultimately seemed to reinforce the disappoint they experienced when that time was not as joy-filled
as they planned.

“She’s Been Challenging my Authority Left and Right”: An Intensive Approach to Remote Learning
During the pandemic, some mothers’ children transitioned to remote learning. Consistent with
prior research on intensive parenting (Collins 2019; Damaske 2011; Hays 1998; Ishizuka 2018;
Lareau 2011), many of these mothers approached remote learning with a high level of intensity. That
14

meant doing the work (if any) required by their children’s schools and supplementing that work with
additional instructional activities.
For these mothers, increased time with children was often a source of stress and anxiety.
Sabrina (white, advanced degree) works in sports medicine; her husband (white, bachelor’s degree) is
a non-profit manager. The preschool/childcare center Sabrina’s four-year-old and one-year-old
attended remained open during the pandemic, but Sabrina kept them home because of the health
risk. That meant helping her preschooler learn from home:
Sabrina: So I get up and get the kids ready for the day. And it depends on the day. If
I do morning or my husband does the morning school with our daughter... So we'll
do little lessons for 45 minutes or whatever and then she'll do art, she'll play.… And
then we'll switch after lunchtime. And like I said on Sundays, sometimes even midweek we have to sit down and reassess our schedule. But we really try to map it out
and make sure we know who's with the kids and who's working.
Interviewer: Is [four-year-old]’s school providing resources for you?
Sabrina: They did. They gave her, gosh, maybe 25 worksheets or something, but she
sat down and just flew through them. So we have some other workbooks and things
that we have for her too. We got two preschool books that she's doing.
Interviewer: And how is your daughter doing with all this?
Sabrina: She actually is struggling… She had a little bit of a breakdown Friday
morning about, “I don't know what my preschool looks like and I don't remember
what my teacher looks like.”… She’ll say, “This isn't fair and I don't understand.”
And so that's been hard and it's kind of heart wrenching.
Like many mothers, Sabrina was anxious about the impact that transitioning to remote learning was
having on her daughter. Sabrina dealt with that anxiety, in part, by trying to make home as schoollike as possible, even when that meant doing more than what the school required. That pressure to
do more, in turn, created stress for Sabrina and her husband in trying to balance their daughter’s
schooling with their work.
Being pushed into remote learning also led to increased frustrations with children, particularly
when mothers took an intensive approach. Janice (Asian/white, bachelor’s degree) is a stay-at-home
mom with a one-year-old and a seven-year-old. Her husband (white, bachelor’s degree) is a digital
artist who worked from home during the pandemic. When Janice’s seven-year-old’s school closed,
Janice was dissatisfied with the quality of remote instruction provided by the school and thus began
providing supplemental instruction and activities:
[My daughter’s] school district was not doing any kind of e-learning at first. They just
kind of took the 20 days waiver from the state and just said “we're not going to be
doing anything.” The e-learning through her school just started a week ago. And
since her teacher is a substitute… and the work he was assigning the kids, it's been
really boring. I don't want her entire school day to be just what he's assigning…. [So]

15

I've just still been trying to have her engage in fun things for school... I feel like what
I'm doing is the main thing and what he's assigning is some supplements stuff.
Janice went on to describe the schedule she created for her daughter:
We did a homeschool schedule. And it works around my baby's nap schedule so I
can give attention to both of them and make sure everybody knows what they're
supposed to be doing at any given hour. One of the first things I did was teach her
how to read a clock so that she knows what is going on at what time… All in all, she
gets four-and-a-half hours of school time. And it's broken in between a lot of
different things. We don't have a printer, so there's no worksheets in our house.
Most of it's online or journaling or different art projects…. We never told her it was
spring break. We just kept on doing homeschool.
While this intensive schedule worked well at the beginning, Janice told us that her daughter
ultimately began resisting Janice’s authority as a teacher, which then led stress, frustration, and
anxiety for Janice:
She was doing really well with homeschool for a few weeks. And I was like, wow, I'm
really on top of it. This is awesome. And then I feel like the last week she's been
challenging my authority left and right…. [Like] when she doesn't want to do
something or she keeps on talking and she's not getting anything done. I tell her she
needs to be silent until she finishes writing. Today it was the months of the year. I
was like, “No, you're going to have to raise your hand if you have anything to say.”
She just was like giving the, “Mo-om.” I was like, “Nope. Not your mom, teacher.” I
just left the room and had her do that. But yeah, it's things like that which happens
every five minutes.
Janice worried that her daughter’s resistance to learning from home might have a long-term negative
impact on her daughter’s desire to learn.
I feel like for a long time I was coping with everything really well. Now, I'd say
honestly the biggest [challenge] is just arguing with [my daughter]. Trying not to
argue too much that she gets burnt out. I want her to still want to learn. So, it's
mostly just coming up with new fun ways to engage her and learning without tiring
her out…. I know it's challenging for her in ways that she doesn't even know how to
verbalize. I think she is missing her friends and it's starting to affect her even though
she doesn't know it.
Essentially, and as for other mothers who took an intensive approach to remote learning, Janice’s
increased time with her children created anxiety and stress as well as frustration with her daughter.
Faced with the stress, anxiety, and frustration of remote learning, mothers like Janice and
Sabrina often described turning to food or alcohol to cope. Sabrina, for example, noted:
My group of coworkers that all have little girls, we kind of send each other little
messages like… What was it the other day? Oh, I said ‘Yeah, I just locked myself in

16

the bathroom and ate an Oreo cookie. How’s your day going?’ You know? Because
we have those moments. This isn’t all perfect.
Similarly, when asked about coping, Janice noted:
I have a lot of friends with young kids and we try to mostly make light of it just
because humor is how most of us get through our days with little kids, babies and
everything. It's just a lot of meme sharing and joking around about our wine supplies
and things like that.
Food and alcohol were common coping mechanisms for pandemic parenting stress. As Betsy (white,
bachelor’s degree), who has been working from home without childcare and helping her preschooler
transition to remote learning, noted: “We’ll say probably alcohol consumption’s up a little bit.”

HOW SOME MOTHERS AVOIDED THE STRESS OF INCREASED PARENTING TIME
While some mothers experienced the time demands of pandemic parenting as a source of
increased stress, anxiety, and frustrations with their children, others managed to avoid those
outcomes. That included mothers whose childcare was not disrupted, either because their prepandemic caregivers remained accessible or because they were already providing full-time care at
home. It also included mothers experiencing less pressure toward intensive work and intensive
parenting. And it included mothers for whom time with their children offered a welcome distraction
from other stresses, anxieties, and frustrations they were experiencing in their lives.

“I like being with them more”: Remote Work/Learning with No Disruptions in Childcare
Some mothers in our study were able avoid disruptions in childcare, even while they
transitioned to remote work. As shown in Table 2, many of these mothers (50%) still reported
spending a great deal more time with their children than they did pre-pandemic. And yet, these
mothers tended not to experience increased time as a substantial source of stress, anxiety, or
frustration with their children. Lauren (white, advanced degree), for example, is a university
professor, and her husband (white, advanced degree) works in healthcare. As she did before the
pandemic, Lauren’s mother-in-law continued to provide childcare for Lauren’s four-year-old
daughter and one-year-old son. Even with childcare, telecommuting still created some stress for
Lauren, but she ultimately appreciated the extra time at home:
I enjoy staying home and working so I can see them grow and do new things that I
would miss when I’m at work in the office environment. My son is starting to talk
more, so I get to hear him say new words and try new words out. Going to get the
mail, my daughter will ride her scooter, and she’s doing more advanced tricks on it,
and it’s fun to see her gain more confidence. I like being home. I like being with
them more. Even if I’m working, just being around them is great. It’s challenging to
work though when they want me. [But] I think I’d rather have that challenge than be
in the office environment.

17

Like Lauren, Ruth (white, bachelor’s degree) also transitioned to remote work (as a researcher),
while her husband (white, high school diploma) continued working outside the home as a truck
driver. Ruth’s nanny continued to provide full-time childcare and remote learning support for her
one-year-old, three-year-old, and six-year-old. As a result, Ruth had time to find and enjoy activities
with her children. As Ruth told us:
We’re not doing our extracurriculars that we normally would do, like we’re not doing
swim class or dance class or anything like that. So we’ve been trying to do some of
that stuff at home with the kids. Like, we have a little dance class where we do
TikTok dances together. And I’m trying to work on kind of more school work stuff
with my 6-year-old. We do her e-learning but we’re trying to do other learning stuff
throughout the day too like if I find a fun science experiment on Pinterest then we’ll
do that in the evening when I’m off work or something like that.
For mothers like Lauren and Ruth, maintaining access to childcare allowed them to enjoy their
increased parenting time, even with the added stress of telecommuting with children at home.
Even before the pandemic, some mothers were telecommuting without childcare or
homeschooling their children. Many of these mothers still reported increased parenting time (i.e.,
because their children were no longer participating in extracurricular activities or playdates), but they
tended not to experience that increased time as a substantial source of stress. Pre-pandemic, Lisa
(Hispanic, advanced degree), was homeschooling her kindergartner and preschooler and working
remotely part-time without childcare. She continued doing so during pandemic:
I'm the one that's primarily at home. I'm the one that's educating the children and
things like that, doing most of that work. It hasn't changed a whole lot. In fact, that's
good in general, and on purpose to kind of keep the routine and keep the structure
and not just turn everything upside down for the kids. In some ways, it's nicer having
my husband at home because if there is something, then he's right there. I do teach
online on Mondays and so it's been really nice. Before I had to be like, “Okay, let's
set up a video for the kids to watch,” or put the kids down for a nap so that I can go
teach my class, and now it's like, [to my husband]: “Okay, you got them? You can do
whatever you want. I'll see you later.”
The increased time demands of pandemic parenting did create some stress for Lisa, but the added
support she received from her husband (white, Advanced degree) was enough to help her cope:
Without having things like play dates and things like that, where I would get out of
the house more, I think maybe two or three weeks in and there was one day where I
was just like, “Ahh! I need to have some space!” And so since then [my husband has]
been really conscious to [step in]. Like, there was one or two nights where he was
like, “You know what, I'll just take the kids out for a walk and then you can have
some time alone, things like that.” Like I said, in general I'm used to it and it's fine,
but still, nevertheless, not having those normal outlets that I do to have small breaks
from the kids, yeah, after a couple of weeks that kind of builds up. You're like, okay,
I need a little break, just little one.

18

For Lisa and other mothers who were already homeschooling or working remotely without
childcare, the pandemic has made parenting more difficult, but the added time they are spending
with their children has not been a substantial source of stress, particularly if they have partners who
are now more able to help at home.

“The Most Important Thing is Just Not to Stress About It”:
Rejecting Intensive Parenting to Reduce Pandemic Stress
Given the added time demands of pandemic parenting, and to reduce the stress of those
demands, some mothers rejected pressures toward intensive parenting and scaled back the
intensiveness of their approach. That included mothers who allowed their children more screen-time
than pre-pandemic. Denise (white, advanced degree) and her husband (white, advanced degree)
found that being “laxer” with screen-time allowed them to more easily meet their work demands (as
university professors) while caring for their one-year-old son:
Denise: Screen time, I have been laxer with screen time, but he still is a little too
young. He doesn't seem to care all that much, so I don't know to what extent that's
actually affecting him.
Interviewer: Why do you think you're more lax about it?
Denise: Because I just feel everyone's in survival mode, and if what I need is 15
minutes of downtime… and the way that that comes is by him staring at Moana,
then that's fine.
Like Denise, some mothers reported scaling back the intensiveness of their parenting to reduce the
stress of increased parenting time.
Some mothers also scaled back the intensity of remote learning to reduce the stress of
pandemic parenting demands. Heather (white, some college) is a stay-at-home mom with five kids
ranging from one year old to sixteen. Her husband (white, some college) works in construction. Prepandemic, Heather was homeschooling all her children, and when the pandemic hit, she decided to
take an even more relaxed approach to instruction:
I’ve kind of just eased up on school stuff for a while because I know that they’re
worried about what’s going on right now, and I figure we have time to worry about
all of that…. The most important thing is just not to stress about it. The biggest
mistake I made when I first started homeschooling was to try to make home like
school, and homeschool isn’t really like school. It’s hard to explain, but I tried to be
very on a schedule and do all the different subjects. Now, we do more of the childbased learning. Whatever they’re interested in, we’ll let them learn that. Let them
just read books for fun and play outside…. We have chickens and goats, and [after
feeding the animals] they come in and pick up and do all of their chores, and they
kind of are just free to do what they want to do until lunch. Then sometimes they
choose a time to play video games or watch TV. Sometimes they’ll color or do art
projects, especially the little ones. My older two, they have Khan Academy, so they

19

get online and do some lessons and stuff. We’re planting a lot of stuff like seeds and
planting seasonings and stuff. We’re working on our garden.
Like Denise and Heather, some mothers recognized that intensive parenting might be untenable in
the wake of pandemic-related disruptions. Thus, they opted to scale back the intensity of their
parenting to reduce stress.

“I didn’t have enough time to be with my son”:
Pandemic Parenting as a Welcome Distraction from Other Stressors
For some mothers, time with children was a welcome distraction from other pandemic-related
stress. That included mothers who could not work remotely. Jillian (white, advanced degree), for
example, works as an ICU nurse, and she has seen patients die from COVID-19. Jillian’s in-laws
continued providing regular childcare for her one-year-old daughter while she and her husband
(white, high school diploma) worked. Parenting, however, has not been a primary source of stress
for Jillian during the pandemic. Instead, when asked about the most difficult challenges she has
faced, Jillian talked at length about her job and her fears of getting her family sick:
I’m exhausted, just mentally and physically exhausted and trying to just stay awake so
I can spend time with [my husband and my daughter]. Now that we’ve got showers
at work I at least can shower before I come home and pick up [my daughter] because
before it was like “I don’t want to really pick you up here right now.”
Essential workers like Jillian faced tremendous stress during the pandemic, but with childcare in
place, mothers like Jillian did not always experience time with their children as a source of strain.
Instead, many looked forward to time with their children at the end of a long day.
For some mothers unemployed during the pandemic, added time with children also served as a
respite from the other stress they faced. Sierra (Black, high school diploma) is a single mother with a
one-year-old son. Pre-pandemic, Sierra worked full-time in retail—she never got to take time off,
even after her son was born. Just before the pandemic, however, Sierra had moved away from
Indiana to live closer to (though not with) her baby’s father (Black, high school diploma). Sierra had
just found a room in a shared apartment and was looking for work when the pandemic hit. Because
of the pandemic and its impact on the local community (COVID-19 outbreaks at a local factory led
to widespread layoffs), however, Sierra could not find a job. As a result, Sierra was finally able to
spend time with her son:
I’m enjoying it because when I used to work a lot, I used to complain how I didn’t
have enough time to be with my son. That’s one of the good things about it that I
can spend a lot of time with him now. We do finger painting. I got the big white
boards, and we just color. I just let him scribble and stuff, and we play Connect
Four. I taught him how to play that. We do that and watch TV.
Sierra went on to explain that she has only been able to spend more time with her son because of
the financial assistance she has received during the pandemic, including economic relief through the
CARES Act, WIC benefits, and rent waivers.

20

The only thing that was helping me lately was the stimulus check, so that helped a
lot. At first, I didn’t believe it. I did not believe it because I’m like that’s not true for
them to give us money, but when I got it, I was just so happy. I paid my car
insurance, and I had got my son a lot of clothes because he’s growing, and he needs
some more shoes. I put some in my savings account. I’m just not trying to touch it
because I never know what will happen if, I don’t know. I’m just using the money as
a backup. [And] where I’m at, they stopped us from paying rent for right now,
because they know a lot of people lost their jobs and stuff like that [when a local
factory laid off workers], so I’m really okay about my utility bills and my rent because
the place where I’m staying at, they just waived it. They said until further notice, so
every month they’ll let us know if they want us to pay something off or they’re just
going to work with us. That’s a good thing. [And when I first heard it] I didn’t
believe that either. When that happened, I was just a happy person. I don’t have a
job right now, so that was a blessing.
Without that financial support, the pandemic would likely have taken a much bigger toll on Sierra
and her son. When asked how things would have been different without the Economic Relief
payments and the rent and utility waivers she received, Sierra explained:
It probably would have been even harder because I know I can’t really ask a lot of
people for money because a lot of people that I know, their jobs laid them off, so I
don’t know. It’s getting hard out there for a lot of people. I know a lot of people
that were working at the chicken plant. They lost their jobs. So, it was a lot of cases
of the coronavirus in it, and those are like the good paying jobs, and they have kids,
so I know that was hard for them. And they used to get paid every week, and now
that they don’t get paid, and they already got their last check, now they’ve got to
apply for unemployment. You never know how long that will take.
Of course, even with the economic relief payments and the rent and utility waivers, Sierra has found
that, without income from a paid job, it is difficult to meet all her son’s needs. Sierra, for example,
receives support with groceries through WIC, but because people are stocking up on supplies, she
has not always been able to find the products she can purchase with her benefits. As she explained:
Not having a job, it’s not easy to get all of the products that I need. Trying to get
food from the grocery stores. A lot of people buy all the meat, all milk and cheese
and eggs, and it’s been hard to get stuff like that lately. When we eat breakfast, we
eat in every day, and [my son] needs milk because he drinks whole milk, and I get it
from WIC, but it’s been hard because a lot of people’s just been buying it up. [And]
my son is only one, so he needs the Pampers and wipes, and it’ll be hard to get it
because a lot of people go in, like I feel like they’re sending all their family members
out to go get all the supplies. Then when it’s time for us to go in at 9:00, there won’t
be no Pampers, no wipes. So, I have to order online, and then when I try to go
online, it’s out of stock because people are just stocking up. That’s been the hard
part for me and my son. There’s a church that’s giving out products or whatever.
They’ll be giving out Pampers, but sometimes they don’t have his size, so I don’t

The struggle to meet her son’s needs has taken a toll on Sierra. And yet, because of the financial
support she received, Sierra was able to enjoy extra time with her son that she previously desired but
was unable to afford.

DISCUSSION
In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, schools, childcare centers, businesses, and services
closed, forcing many U.S. parents to spend more time with their children. These disruptions raise
questions about how unanticipated increases in parenting time might impact mothers’ well-being.
We answer these questions using a mixed-methods study involving surveys (N=139) and in-depth
interviews (N=65) with Southern Indiana mothers, conducted in the early stages of COVID-19’s
spread across the U.S. (April-May 2020).
We find that, because of pandemic-related disruptions to paid work and childcare routines,
many mothers greatly increased their time with their children. These increased time demands were
also associated with increased stress, anxiety, and frustrations with their children. Our qualitative
data reveal that childcare disruptions amplified the negative impact of increased parenting time. This
was especially true for mothers whose disrupted childcare arrangements were coupled with intensive
work pressures and/or pressure to follow intensive parenting norms. Meanwhile, other mothers did
not experience increased time with their children as a substantial source of stress, and some even
experienced increased parenting time a source of joy in the face of other pandemic-related stresses.
Ultimately, these findings suggest that pandemic-related disruptions in mothers’ childcare and
paid work routines led many mothers to experience increased stress, anxiety, and frustration with
their children. Thus, there is reason to believe that pandemic-related disruptions are threatening not
only mothers’ health (Pearlin et al. 2005; Read and Gorman 2010) but also children’s well-being, as
well (Augustine and Crosnoe 2010; Morgan et al. 2014; Turney 2011, 2012).

Limitations
Of course, this study is limited in that the data are not nationally representative—PPS mothers
are disproportionately white, partnered, and highly educated. Because COVID-19’s impact on
communities of color, both health-wise (Pirtle 2020), and in terms of unemployment (Moen, Pedtke,
and Flood 2020), there is reason to suspect that Black mothers, Indigenous mothers, and other
mothers of color have experienced different pandemic-related challenges than white mothers. These
different challenges, in turn, may shape how mothers experienced unanticipated increases in
parenting time.
Another limitation of this study is that it relies on mothers’ reports of changes in the time they
spend caring for their children. Time diary data would offer a more accurate picture of changes in
mothers’ parenting time (Belli, Stafford, and Alwin 2009). That said, perceptions of time use may
matter more than actual time use in determining mothers’ experiences of that time (Christopher
2020). Furthermore, and as we see here, perceptions of changes in parenting time may matter for
mothers’ well-being, regardless of the actual magnitude of the change in mothers’ time.

22

Implications
By revealing the added stress, anxiety, and frustrations that some mothers are experiencing
during the pandemic, and by linking those changes in mothers’ well-being to changes in mothers’
parenting time, this study offers important insights for research and policy. First, these findings
clarify our understanding of the consequences of parents’ time with children. Prior research finds
that “family time” is beneficial for parents (Flood et al. 2020; Musick et al. 2016; Offer 2014) and
that most parents would prefer more time with their children (Meier et al. 2016; Milkie et al. 2004,
2019). As we see here, however, and consistent with research on the impact of parenthood on
parents’ mental health (Glass et al. 2016; Nomaguchi and Milkie 2003), substantial, unanticipated
increases in parenting time can, at least for some mothers, be detrimental to well-being. Such
findings highlight the importance of considering not only the amount of time parents spend with
their children but also changes in parenting time and the contexts in which those changes occur.
To that end, and consistent with research on the link between childcare and mothers’ well-being
(Glass et al. 2016), our study emphasizes the importance of childcare access for mothers’ enjoyment
of time with their children. Childcare disruptions amplified the stress, anxiety, and frustration that
mothers experienced in managing increased pandemic parenting demands. To avoid those
outcomes, many families had to rely on nannies or grandparents for care. These options, however,
are not universally accessible, given the high cost of professional care (Malik 2019) and the risks that
COVID-19 poses to elderly individuals (Jordan, Adab, and Cheng 2020). From a public policy and
public health perspective, then, these findings illustrate the need for universal access to affordable
professional childcare centers (Hofferth 1999; Ruppanner, Moller, et al. 2019). And they emphasize
the necessity of funding these facilities to safely remain open, even amidst public health threats.
Our study also reveals how intensive work and parenting demands can lead mothers to
experience more stress, anxiety, and frustration in navigating disruptions to normal routines. These
findings are consistent with pandemic research linking telecommuting to stress for mothers
(Lyttelton et al. 2020) and with previous research showing how intensive work demands exacerbate
work-family conflict (Clarkberg and Moen 2016; Collins 2019; Damaske 2011; Gerson 1985; Glass
and Estes 1997) and hurt workers’ well-being (Craig and Brown 2017; Damaske, Zawadzki, and
Smyth 2016; Kleiner 2014; Milkie et al. 2004, 2019; Ruppanner, Perales, et al. 2019). They are also
consistent with research showing how intensive parenting norms generate guilt and stress for
mothers who (because of paid work responsibilities or limited resources) struggle to meet those
demands (Christopher 2012; Collins 2019; Damaske 2011; Elliott et al. 2015; Gerson 1985; Hays
1998; Nelson 2010; Rizzo et al. 2013; Romagnoli and Wall 2012).
Mothers, however, should not be blamed for attempting to remain engaged in intensive work or
intensive parenting. For mothers working remotely during the pandemic, a failure to meet intensive
work demands could put their careers at risk (Munsch 2016). Meanwhile, and because of strong
normative pressures toward intensive parenting (Ishizuka 2018; Romagnoli and Wall 2012), mothers
who struggle to follow intensive parenting norms may experience the kind of scrutiny (Edwards
2004; Elliott and Bowen 2018; Elliott et al. 2015; Romagnoli and Wall 2012) that further undermines
well-being (Link and Phelan 2001).

23

On a policy level, then, our findings highlight the need not only for universal access to
affordable childcare but also for interventions reducing intensive work and parenting pressures and
ensuring that all mothers have the resources they need. Thinking of mothers like Sierra, our study
reveals how having sufficient financial resources allows mothers to enjoy time with their children.
Without the support Sierra received through the CARES Act, WIC benefits, rent and utility waivers,
and diapers and wipes from a local church, and as Sierra was quick to acknowledge, it would have
been far more difficult to enjoy that time. Ultimately, then, our study supports calls to extend the
expanded federal unemployment benefits put in place during the pandemic and to ensure that all
families have access to sufficient financial resources, regardless of their ability to find work and
regardless of whether we are in crisis or in “normal” times.
