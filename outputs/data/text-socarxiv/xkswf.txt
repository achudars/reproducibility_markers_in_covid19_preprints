Abstract
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the worst pandemic since the Spanish flu, has
spread rapidly across the world. This study investigates this pandemic from the
perspective of government responses. The analyses are not limited to the effect of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on deaths, but also cover the effect of confirmed
COVID-19 cases and deaths on NPIs using daily cross-national data. This paper also
shows the precise timing in which NPIs have a reduced effect on deaths. The results
indicate that confirmed cases are more positively correlated with NPIs than deaths, and
NPIs show a strong positive correlation with deaths in the short run and a negative
correlation in the long run. The turnaround time is about 25 days. This means that NPIs
take about one month to reduce the number of deaths.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the worst pandemic since the Spanish flu, has
spread rapidly across the world. Initially, China reported many deaths but after a short
time, European and North and South American countries became the major battlefields
of COVID-19 infections. Scholars have debated the factors behind this huge difference
between these countries. This study investigates this pandemic from the perspective of
government responses and analyzes the relationship between confirmed COVID-19 cases
or deaths and government responses.
Using daily cross-national data, scholars have reported that governments’ strict
measures to prevent the spread of pandemics, called non-pharmaceutical interventions
(NPIs), can effectively reduce the growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths
(Hsiang et al. 2020; Dergiades et al. 2020; Hale et al. 2020c)1. Case studies in China also
reached a similar conclusion, that the lockdown of the city of Wuhan effectively
prevented the disease from spreading throughout the country (Fang et al. 2020; Lai et
al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020). A study in Scandinavian countries reported that stricter
lockdown policies are associated with fewer COVID-19 deaths (Conyon et al. 2020).
Other studies in the United States also argued that the social distancing ordered by the

government lowered the growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths
(Courtemanche et al. 2020; Lyu et al. 2020)2.
Most aforementioned studies reported the reduction effect of NPIs on confirmed
COVID-19 cases and deaths. However, the causality between these variables was not
necessarily taken into consideration. The government usually takes strong measures
after confirmed cases start to increase. This response is likely to affect the numbers of
confirmed cases and deaths. If the causal direction between confirmed cases or deaths
from COVID-19 and government response is disregarded, the effects of NPIs or
confirmed cases and deaths may be inaccurately estimated. For example, Hale et al.
(2020c) provided one of the most comprehensive studies using cross-national data of 170
countries. However, the authors only considered the effect of NPIs on the number of
deaths from COVID-19. On the other hand, the current study considers bidirectional
causality to understand the dynamic relationship between the variables.
Figure 1 shows the trends of the confirmed cases, deaths, and NPIs in Japan, which
have puzzled Western countries because of the success in preventing the disease from
spreading throughout the country. Figure 1 helps us understand the causality. In the

lasting economic damage (Correia et al. 2020).

beginning, COVID-19 cases were reported, and NPIs were conducted by the Japanese
government immediately after reporting. After sometime, deaths from the disease began
to be reported. This clearly suggests that the government took measures to combat the
pandemic, paying special attention to confirmed cases. However, once confirmed cases
increase, successive deaths cannot be avoided. Thus, COVID-19 deaths would naturally
increase even after the government takes measures, irrespective of whether they are
smoothly and successfully introduced. This may lead to spurious correlations between
NPIs and COVID-19 deaths, even if there may not have a direct relationship. It is for
this reason that this study takes into account this potential problem in the analysis.

Statistical Analysis
The effect of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths on NPIs
First, this study analyzes the effect of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths on NPIs
using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. The number of confirmed COVID-19
cases and deaths are obtained from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at
Johns Hopkins University 3 . Hale et al. (2020c) operationalizes government NPIs by

creating NPI scores. They measure a composite Stringency Index (SI). It is composed of
nine relevant policy response indicators each of which range from 0-100. It averages
these nine scores (Hale et al. 2020c: 6). The data is extracted from Hale et al.’s (2020c)
study, on which Hale et al.’s (2020a) research is based4. The data cover 151 countries in
which at least one death was reported between January 22, 2020 and July 9, 2020. The
first analysis uses NPIs as the dependent variable and confirmed cases and deaths as
the independent variables. The independent variables are transformed into a five-day
moving average5. This study takes the first difference in logs of the confirmed cases and
deaths to capture the growth rate of infections based on Hsiang et al. (2020) and Hale et
al. (2020c) and the first difference of the NPIs. The number of days since the first
confirmed case was reported in a country is included in the analysis to control for the
linear time trend. The study takes lags from day 0 to -70, with five-day intervals of the
independent variable to consider the lagged effects of the variable6.

Figure 2 shows confirmed cases (the right bars of the pair variables) are consistently
more likely to affect NPIs than deaths (the left bars of the pair variables). The result
implies that the government usually takes measures to stop pandemic and pays special
attention to confirmed cases before reported deaths start to increase. This result is highly
intuitive. The bar on the extreme right (0 confirmed) shows that many countries respond
immediately after confirmed cases increase (see Figure 2). This positive relationship at
the time between confirmed cases and NPIs, however, seems too strong. This may be
because the government sometimes predicts the upsurge of cases in the near future and
takes preventive measures beforehand. Even if the estimation result in Figure 2
captures this exaggerated effect, it does not matter for the relatively stronger effect of
confirmed cases on NPIs than deaths.

The effect of NPIs on COVID-19 deaths
The study further analyzes the effect of NPIs on COVID-19 deaths. The regression
models are basically the same as in the above analysis. The following are just Slightly
different points: In this analysis (see Figure 3), the study calculates deaths from COVID19 per 100,000 people to estimate the real effect7. The confirmed cases are excluded from

the analysis. Figure 3 shows the regression results.

Figure 3. The effect of NPIs on COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people

Figure 3 illustrates a strong positive correlation between NPIs and deaths in the short
run (15 days before). However, the positive sign of the coefficient suddenly changes in
the other direction. After 25 days, the two variables were negatively correlated. At first
glance, the results seem quite odd because NPIs have an increasing effect on COVID-19
deaths. Here, refer to Figure 1 for the Japanese case, which may be helpful in resolving
9

this discrepancy. The Japanese government took measures to combat the pandemic
immediately after COVID-19 cases began to be reported. However, regardless of whether
the government took immediate appropriate measures, the number of deaths without a
“silver bullet” or vaccine inevitably increased once confirmed cases began to rise. The
strong positive effect in the short run within 20 days is likely to capture spurious
correlations, as mentioned above8. NPIs taken more 20 days before can have a reducing
effect on the number of deaths. This means that NPIs take about one month to reduce
the number of deaths.
This finding is consistent with Hale et al.’s (2020c), who took six-week lags of the
NPI variable rather arbitrarily and reported that NPIs reduce COVID-19 deaths.
However, their study analyzed the effect of NPIs on COVID-19 deaths and took the
pinpoint lag only. On the other hand, this study explores the effects of confirmed COVID19 cases and deaths on NPIs and of NPIs on deaths. This study also takes different lags
to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the variables.
These two points are the main contributions of this study to past research.

NPIs are such stringent measures. The idea may not be totally rejected that NPIs
confuse the society, which lead to the growing number of deaths.

Conclusion
This study explores the relationship between confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths and
government measures to combat the pandemic. The analyses are not limited to the effect
of NPIs on deaths, but also cover the effect of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths on
NPIs using daily cross-national data. This paper also shows the precise timing in which
NPIs have a reduced effect on deaths. The results indicate that confirmed cases are more
positively related to NPIs than deaths, and NPIs have a strong positive correlation with
deaths in the short run and a negative correlation in the long run. The turning point is
about 25 days. This means that NPIs take about one month to reduce the number of
deaths. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report such findings.
