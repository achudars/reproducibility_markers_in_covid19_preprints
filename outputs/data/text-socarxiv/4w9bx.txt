Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic is causing substantial increases in mortality across populations,
potentially causing stagnation or decline in life expectancy. We explored this idea by
examining the impact of excess mortality linked to the COVID-19 crisis on life expectancy in
the region of Madrid (Spain). Using data from the Daily Mortality Surveillance System
(MoMo), we calculated excess mortality (death counts) for the weeks 10 th to 14th in 2020
using data on expected and observed mortality, assuming no further excess mortality during
the rest of the year. The expected annual mortality variation was +6%, +21% and +25%
among men aged under 65, between 65 and 74 and over 75, respectively, and +5%, +13%,
and 18% for women, respectively. This excess mortality during weeks 10 th to 14th resulted in
a life expectancy at birth decline of 1.6 years among men and 1.1 years among women.
These estimates confirm that Madrid and other severely hit regions in the world may face
substantial life expectancy declines.

Main text
The COVID-19 pandemic is causing substantial increases in mortality across populations
worldwide. According to the WHO, by April 20th more than 157,000 confirmed COVID-19
deaths have occurred worldwide, more than 103,000 of these in Europe (1). The pandemic
has overwhelmed health systems in many countries, potentially leading to increases in
morbidity and mortality beyond the direct impact of COVID-19 infection. These increases in
mortality, both direct and indirect, have the potential to cause stagnations or declines in life
expectancy.
We explored this idea by examining the role of COVID-19 crisis on life expectancy levels in
the region of Madrid, the most affected region in Spain (2,3). We do so by estimating
expected changes in annual life expectancy accounting for the excess mortality in the five
COVID-19 weeks for which data are available and nearly complete at this moment.
We used data from the Spanish Sistema de vigilancia de la mortalidad diaria (Daily Mortality
Surveillance System, MoMo, updated April 21st) (4). We calculated excess mortality (death
counts) for the weeks 10th to 14th in 2020 (from March 2nd to April 5th, 2020) by subtracting
observed minus expected mortality by age group (<65, 65-74 and 75+) and sex. We
estimated the expected annual increase in age- and sex-specific mortality by using the
estimated excess mortality in the five weeks and assuming no other changes in mortality in
the other days/weeks of the year. For the younger age group (age <65), excess mortality
was distributed according to the distribution of COVID-19 deaths for Spain (3). We used the
life tables for Madrid in 2018 from the Instituto de Estadística de la Comunidad de Madrid
(Statistics Institute of the region of Madrid) (5) to estimate counterfactual life expectancies by
age and sex in 2020.
During weeks 10th through 14th, 2020, there were 11,852 observed deaths in Madrid,
resulting in an absolute excess mortality of 7,811 deaths. The highest excess mortality
occurred in week 13th (March 23rd to March 29th), where the mortality ratio between observed

3

and expected deaths at age 65 and over ranged between 5.0 and 5.5 among men and
between 4.1 and 4.2 among women. Assuming no further changes in mortality, the expected
annual mortality variation for men was +6% for those under the age 65, +21% for those aged
65-74 and +25% for those aged 75 and over. For women, the annual mortality variation was
+5%, +14%, and +18%, respectively.
We estimated a decline in life expectancy at birth of 1.6 years among men and 1.1 years
among women (Figure 1). The declines in life expectancy at age 65 were 1.5 years among
men and 1.1 years among women, while the declines in life expectancy at age 75 were 1.3
years among men and 1.0 years among women (Supplementary Figure). These observed
potential declines in life expectancy would bring back the life expectancy at birth of 2020 in
Madrid to the levels of 2009/10.
Our estimates are potentially conservative, as we have assumed that mortality for the rest of
the year would follow the expected mortality for previous years. There are reasons to believe
that there will be excess mortality, at least in the following weeks, as the COVID-19 epidemic
is still on-going in the region. Moreover, the significant medium-term impact of the disruption
of the healthcare system could result in a higher death toll in the following months due to
chronic conditions that have not been controlled during the peak of the pandemic. On the
other side, a culling effect, similar to that observed after severe flu seasons, where mortality
decreases in the following months, is also possible. The relative strength of both phenomena
will determine whether the life expectancy decline we have estimated will be more or less
intense by the end of the year.
In conclusion, we have shown that the COVID-19 crisis has the potential to severely affect
annual life expectancy in Madrid, bring back life expectancy of 2020 to the levels of 10 years
ago. Whether this pandemic will have long-lasting effects on life expectancy is to be seen,
but continuing to monitor trends in life expectancy in Madrid and worldwide will provide
valuable evidence on this regard.
