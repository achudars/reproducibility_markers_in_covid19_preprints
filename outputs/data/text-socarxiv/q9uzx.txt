Abstract
In the US, new vaccines are banned until accepted as safe and effective by the
FDA. But the approval process is slow and cautious. The faster, but perhaps
riskier, Russian system (like the Chinese) produced an approved coronavirus
vaccine months more quickly, leaving Americans at risk of dying for months
longer than Russians. Despite widespread fears that many would be hesitant to
accept vaccination at all, and understandable doubts about vaccine approval
processes outside the US, data from two national surveys in September 2020
show, very surprisingly, that a majority of Americans at that time would have
willingly taken the Russian vaccine. Moreover a two-to-one majority of
Americans – rich and poor, young and old, Democrat and Republican alike –
believed that they ought to be allowed to buy it. Based on those figures, we
1

estimate that making the Russian vaccine (or the Chinese) immediately
available would have saved 70 or more American lives each day in the autumn
of 2020 and the beginning of 2021. To put that in context, US government
prohibitions on Russian and Chinese vaccines cost more lives each day than the
roughly 45 people killed daily by all American murderers combined. For the US
government, a less authoritarian domestic policy, and a clearer appreciation of
the globalization of medical technology, would seem to be indicated.

1. Introduction
There are widespread fears that many – even well educated, well informed people in
developed nations like the USA, Britain, and the EU – would be hesitant to accept
vaccination against coronavirus.1 Indeed WHO has "vaccine hesitancy" among its top
"ten threats to global health in 2019", The US is no exception (Lin, Tu and Beitsch
2021; Pew 2020a); nor is Europe (Warren and Lofstedt 2021).
There are also doubts, perhaps understandably, about medical technology and vaccine
approval processes outside the US. The consequences of any widespread reluctance or
delay in vaccinating against the highly contagious coronavirus could be dire, as both
practical experience with past epidemics and theoretical modeling of the current
coronavirus pandemic show (for example IHME 2021). All this is well known.
But there is another very salient fact, not so well known, that this paper seeks to
document and analyze in the hope that insights from the social and behavioral
sciences can offer valuable insights to help curb this pandemic (and its successors) by
better understanding the sources of people’s behavior and developing evidence-based
strategies to modify it (Bavel et al. 2020).
Based on data from two large national surveys, this paper shows that, contrary to
widespread fears about vaccine reluctance, the American public was surprisingly
willing to be vaccinated in September of 2020, months before US, British, or EU
approved vaccines were available. Moreover Americans were willing to accept vaccines
from Russia (its "Sputnik V" vaccine, in use in July, described in a peer-reviewed
article in The Lancet and approved by the Ministry of Health of the Russian
Federation [Minzdrav] in August). This is also true of vaccines from China (in use in
China beginning around the same time). For many Americans there was still some
hesitance and intention to delay to see how things worked out, but about 20% were
willing to be vaccinated immediately, and more to be vaccinated in subsequent
months. Indeed they were almost as willing to take the Russian (or Chinese) vaccine
as to take a then hypothetical US approved vaccine.
2

Medically, this was a great opportunity. In the autumn of 2020 with vaccines as yet
unavailable in the US, deaths from coronavirus ran somewhere around 700 to 900 per
day (CDC figures), and went even higher in the winter. Vaccines to reduce the toll
were not approved by the American authorities until the very end of the year and it
still seems likely take some months beyond that for sufficient vaccine to be available,
and for there to be sufficient experience with it to persuade everyone who is
persuadable to get vaccinated.
All this leaves Americans at risk for months longer than necessary. This paper shows
that the risk could have been substantially reduced without a miracle, and without a
change in public opinion. This paper addresses the possibility that Americans might
have taken advantage of the Russian vaccine to reduce the period they would
otherwise be at risk of infection and possible death while awaiting slow-moving
American developments.
Data from two national surveys in September (combined N=2,280) show that about
one American in five was already ready, even eager, to use the existing Russian
vaccine immediately. Most of the rest said they would be ready to use it after it had
been available for a few months. Each of those "vaxers" would not only reduce their
own risk of death, but would reduce the risk of infection throughout their social
network and transitory contacts, saving the lives of others, as well.
If use of the Russian coronavirus vaccine were permitted in the US, we conservatively
estimate that approximately 40 to 100 US lives would have been saved each day after
the first month of availability. Many more would have been saved subsequently, both
from the on-going immunity among the first wave vaccinated, and from subsequent
cohorts accepting vaccination. The benefits would continue at least until US vaccines
become fully available and fully accepted – assuming that earlier vaccines continue
effective against any widespread new variant of the virus, which may be problematic
in the future (IHME 2021) but was not a problem in 2020.
(An earlier version of this paper was published on SocArXiv in October 2020, but the
simple policy change described there – individual freedom of choice – was not adopted
by the US government.)
2. Data
Data are from the International Social Science Survey (ISSS), Round 21, Cohorts 7
and 8. These are separate internet samples fielded beginning September 13 and
September 27 respectively, with almost all completions within a few days of entering
the field. The surveys are part of an ongoing ISSS research project on the coronavirus
pandemic.
All of the surveys so far are Amazon 'Mechanical Turk' internet-based samples. These
can be conducted without risk of contracting coronavirus and, moreover, are swift,
convenient, and cost effective. Internet samples of this sort have been widely used
during the pandemic (Cornesse and Blom 2020; Graham et al. 2020; McFadden
2020).
3

Extensive research shows that Mechanical Turk samples have proven remarkably
accurate for multivariate analyses (Clifford, Jewell and Waggoner 2015; Springer et
al. 2016; Weinberg, Freese and McElhattan 2014), specifically for political affiliations
and attitudes (Clifford, Jewell and Waggoner 2015) and for science-related issues
(Evans and Kelley 2011). We have found that as well, comparing our 2017-2019
internet samples to face-to-face samples in the US and many other countries (from the
International Social Survey Programme's highly regarded "Inequality" series).
A disadvantage is that estimation of population means in internet samples and
predicted values in regression analyses may need to be adjusted because they typically
over represent younger and highly educated people. For the present analysis, such
adjustments make no practical difference because the issues dealt with here are not
much related to age or education (as we show below). Moreover, estimates from Pew's
carefully curated internet sample and our MTurk samples match closely on many
COVID-related questions.
A reanalysis of these data weighting the sample to reflect the joint distribution of age
and education (benchmark: US Census) and the univariate distribution of religious
background (church attendance in childhood: benchmark International Social Survey
Programme 2008) leads to the same conclusions (details available on request).
3. Findings: Widespread acceptance of the Russian coronavirus vaccine
(For clarity, we write in the "ethnographic present" of September 2020 when
respondents were surveyed. At that time Russian and Chinese coronavirus vaccines
were already approved by their national authorities but US, British, and other
vaccines were not yet available or approved by their national authorities.)
Willingness to take the Russian vaccine was assessed by a straightforward direct
question (preceded by an image of two vials of the vaccine ):

The Russians have created a coronavirus vaccine "Sputnik-V" which
has been approved by their Ministry of Health and described in the
respected international journal, The Lancet. If it becomes
available here in November, would you...
8% Certainly take it right away
[scored 1.0]
18% Probably take it right away
[scored .67]
20% Wait and see for a month or so
[scored .67]
23% Wait and see for several months
[scored .67]
14% Probably never take it
[scored .33]
15% Certainly never take it
[scored .00]
2% (I'm already immune, no need for vaccination) [missing]
(100% Total; 2,234 cases; early & late September 2020)
(Scoring reflects estimated probability of vaccinating.)
(Estimated probability of vaccinating: mean .55; s.d. .28)

The percentages on the left in green are the percent distribution of the answers
(respondents did not see them, nor the other material in green). Just 2% believe they
are already immune, although actual immunity is probably closer to 5% or 10% (Anad
et al., 2020). So the risk of infection and the issue of vaccination are actually relevant
to 90% of the population and subjectively and behaviorally relevant to 98%.
Americans were already in September surprisingly willing to accept the Russian
vaccine. Some 8% say they would "certainly" take it right away. Another 18% would
"probably" take it right away.
More, 20%, would "wait and see for a month or so". Yet more, 23%, would wait and see
for several months. The delay is presumably to see whether all goes well for those who
took the vaccine right away.
Finally, fewer than a third of all Americans expected that they would "probably" (14%)
or "certainly" (15%) refuse to take the Russian vaccine.
Thus, there is surprisingly widespread acceptance of the Russian 'Sputnik V' vaccine.
Assuming that around two-thirds of the "probably take it right away" group would
indeed take the vaccine in the first month or so, that suggests that around 20% of
5

Americans would take the Russian vaccine in the first month or so after it becomes
available in the US (8% + [2/3]*18% = 20%). We will see that that would imply a
tremendous savings of American lives.
This 20% acceptance of the Russian vaccine is only a little lower than a CBS/YouGov
poll (CBS 2020) found in the first week of September for a US vaccine (21% say they
would get vaccinated "as soon as possible") with outright rejection (21% "never")
perhaps a little lower than our 15% "never" and 14% "probably never" for the Russian
vaccine. Pew Research Center results for September are similar (Pew 2020). Similar
results have been found in many other nations (for example France: Ward ,Alleaume.
and Peretti-Watel 2020) and for other viruses (Larson, de Figueiredo A, Xiahong, et al.
2016).
Those figures are for taking the Russian vaccine "right away". Many more say they
would wait and see for a month or two. Taking that into account and making some
plausible guesses as shown above (viz that two-thirds of those who "probably" would
take it would eventually do so; and that one-third of those who say "probably never"
would eventually switch and take it) we get an overall estimate of some 55% of
Americans sooner or later taking a Russian vaccine if it were available.
A hypothetial American vaccine
We also asked about a hypothetical American vaccine available at the end of the year,
our results suggesting 27% of Americans would take it in the first month, compared to
the 20% we have seen for the Russian vaccine:
Americans are developing several coronavirus vaccines but none are
available yet. If one becomes available early in November, would
you...
12% Certainly take it right away
22% Probably take it right away
22% Wait and see for a month or so
25% Wait and see for several months
11% Probably never take it
8% Certainly never take it
2% (I'm already immune, no need for vaccination)
(100% Total; 2,347 cases; early & late September 2020)
(Scoring as for the Russian vaccine question above.)
(Estimated probability of vaccinating: mean .61; s.d. .24)

This means that first month uptake intentions for the Russian vaccine are around 26%
lower than for an American vaccine (viz 20% for the Russian vaccine, 27% for the US
vaccine; 1 – (20/27) = 26% lower). Our subsequent data from late 2020 and January
2021 surveys suggest these estimates for the US vaccines turned out to be
substantially correct.
The only other analysis of American intentions to take the Russian vaccine of which
we are aware comes to a similar conclusion about the US-Russia comparison. A careful
analysis of variance based on a late August survey estimated Americans would be 18% less
6

likely to take a Russian vaccine than to take an otherwise similar American one (Motta 2020,
Figure 1).
Taking the "wait and see" answers into account gives a rough estimate of 61% of Americans
willing to eventually take an American vaccine. This is compared to a similar rough estimate of
55% eventually taking the Russian vaccine if it were available.
Broad acceptance of existing Chinese vaccines
Surprisingly, opinion on the existing Chinese vaccine is very similar to that on the
Russian 'Sputnik-V'. This question was asked in our two national surveys in
September, 2020 when the vaccine was already in use in China:

The Chinese have developed a coronavirus vaccine which they are
already giving to their military and people in public contact jobs.
If it becomes available here in October, would you...
10% Certainly take it right away
20% Probably take it right away
22% Wait and see for a month or so
25% Wait and see for several months
12% Probably never take it
10% Certainly never take it
2% (I'm already immune, no need for vaccination)
(100% Total; 2,349 cases; early & late September 2020)
(Scoring as for the Russian vaccine question above.)
(Estimated probability of vaccinating: mean .54; s.d. .28)

Americans are (in our "Ethnographic present" of September 2020) surprisingly willing
to accept the Chinese vaccine: Some 10% say they would "certainly" take it right
away. Another 20% would "probably" take it right away. This is similar to their views
on the Russian vaccine, or even slightly more favorable. Only 12% would "probably
never take it and 10% "certainly" not.
In the only other data about American acceptance of foreign vaccines of which we are
aware, a large national poll in late July 2020 (N=1997) asked about vaccine uptake for
hypothetical US and Chinese vaccines (Morning Consult+Politico, 2020). They also
found substantial willingness to take both. Specifically, 27% "would be among the
first to get vaccinated" for the US vaccine and 19% for the Chinese. Only 17% "would
7

not get vaccinated" with the US vaccine and 23% for the Chinese. The rest would "be
in the middle to get vaccinated" or "be among the last to get vaccinated", in all some
45% for the American vaccine and 41% for the Chinese.
In sum, most Americans would accept Russian or Chinese vaccines.
Broad acceptance of an English vaccine as well
Given that Americans mostly would accept existing Russian and Chinese vaccines (in
our "Ethnographic present" of September 2020) it is hardly surprising that they also
accept the prospect of vaccine from England, a more familiar and more scientifically
advanced nation:
The English are developing and testing a coronavirus vaccine. It
might be approved by the government health authority in England and
become available here in January next year. If you weren’t already
vaccinated would you...
12% Certainly take it right away
20% Probably take it right away
24% Wait and see for a month or so
24% Wait and see for several months
11% Probably never take it
8% Certainly never take it
2% (I'm already immune, no need for vaccination)
(100% Total; 2,365 cases; early & late September 2020)
(Scoring as for the Russian vaccine question above.)
(Estimated probability of vaccinating: mean .62; s.d. .24)

Americans find a hypothetical English vaccine just as acceptable as a hypothetical American one,
roughly 62% willing to take the English and 61% the American. Both of these are only fractionally
more acceptable than the existing Russian and Chinese vaccines.
In short, vaccine globalization.
While globalized preferences are the main story, some people have specific preferences, shown by a
greater willingness to take one nation's vaccine than another nation's. Some prefer the Russian
vaccine to the Chinese (12% of the population) or vice-versa (also 12%). Interestingly, some prefer
the Russian vaccine to the American (also 12%), Some of this may be random measurement error,
an inevitable but familiar complication (
Strikingly, a few who say they would not take the US vaccine at all would probably (7%) or
definitely (1%) take the Russian vaccine right away. So too for probably (6%) or definitely (2%)
taking the Chinese vaccine right away. So making the Russian and Chinese vaccines available in the
US would get a few Americans vaccinated who would not accept vaccination if only an American
vaccines were available.

4. Who would willingly take the Russian vaccine?
Consistent with research on other vaccines in general and COVID vaccines in
particular (Nexøe, Kragstrup and Søgaard 1999; Salmon et al. 2005; Siddiqui, Salmon
and Omer 2013; Vermandere et al. 2016; Freeman et al. 2020; Wong et al. 2020),
demographic and socioeconomic differences in willingness to take the Russian vaccine
are mostly modest (Table 1, column 1). (We are speaking still in the "ethnographic
present" of September 2020).
Older people are a little less willing to vaccinate, other things equal (standardized
effect of -.10, p<.001). The largest differece, one rarely noted in the literature, is that
devout church goers are substantially more willing to vaccinate (standardized total
effect of .20, p<.001); about half of that comes about because their personal life style
and health beliefs (column 1 - column 2 = .20 - .11 = .09, or about half of .20).
Married people, Democrats, and those at the top of the occupational hierarchy (higher
professionals like professors, lawyers, and engineers) rather than those at the bottom
of the hierarchy (like unskilled laborers and farm workers) are all slightly more
inclined to vaccinate (standardized effects around .06 or .07, p<.01). This is in good
part because of their personal life style and health beliefs (compare column 1 and
column 2). Similar age and political differences are found in France (Ward, Alleaume
and Peretti-Watel 2020: Table 1).
All in all demographic, socioeconomic status and political differences are small,
altogether accounting for a paltry 8% of the variance.

Willingness to be vaccinated with the Russian 'Sputnik V' vaccine is widespread
throughout American society (speaking still in the "ethnographic present" of
September 2020) with no statistically significant difference between young and old,
rich and poor, or (more surprisingly in a generally politicized pandemic) between
Democrats and Republicans (Table 1).

Consistent with past research on vaccination for other diseases (Siddiqui, Salmon and
Omer 2013), background and demographic differences are small. Men are fractionally
more accepting (4% more likely to be vaccinated; t=2.29, p<.05). Blacks are 8% more
likely (t=3.98, p<.001) and Hispanics about 10% less likely (t=-2.13, p<.05). The young
are not significantly different than the middle aged; nor (more surprisingly) are the
old. Well educated university graduates are not significantly different from high school
dropouts. Perhaps surprisingly in an otherwise politicized epidemic, political
differences are negligible (in line with other research on vaccination: Motta et al.
2020).
The one socioeconomic difference that clearly matters is occupation: those at the top of
the hierarchy (higher professionals like professors, lawyers, and engineers) are around
12% more likely to accept vaccination than those at the bottom of the hierarchy (like
unskilled laborers and farm workers).
In all, demographic and socioeconomic differences explain only a paltry 2.6% of the
variance. We find the same pattern for potential uptake of Chinese, English, and
future American vaccines (results not shown but available on request and confirmed
by results from our subsequent surveys).
This near randomness in the potential uptake of the Russian (and other) vaccines has
an important implication for understanding vaccination's impact on the epidemic. It
means that those who get vaccinated promptly will be a more or less random sample of
the population and so would be just as likely (or unlikely) to get infected as anyone
else. And so just as likely or unlikely to die as anyone else.
So, for example, if vaccination reaches 20% of the population and protects (say) 50% of
those vaccinated from subsequent infection, then it reduces the rate of infection – and
presumably also the death rate – by 10% (viz .20 * .50 = .10).
This is the basic assumption in our model.
6. The Russian vaccine's potential reduction in American coronavirus deaths
6.1. Estimation
We model the Russian vaccine's possible effect on America's coronavirus death rates
simply and straightforwardly (further details in Appendix 1). There is at present no
other vaccine available in the US, nor any likely to be available for some months, so
we begin with a vaccine tabula rasa (recall that we are still speaking in the
"ethnographic present" of September 2020 and that events are indeed bearing out
these expectations).
Deaths from COVID-19 in September were running around 700 to 900 a day. Death
rates were higher earlier in the epidemic, lower for a while in the summer, and higher
in the winter. We take 700 a day as a plausible ballpark figure to work with.
Increasing it by (say) half (as in fact happened late in 2020), or reducing it by half,
would change our estimates in proportion.
12

For simplicity and clarity, we consider only the first month's uptake of the Russian
vaccine, drawing on the estimates from our survey with specifically 20% following
through with their expressed intention of taking the vaccine "right away" when it
becomes available. We assume this is a random 20% of the population with respect to
the risk of infection and the subsequent risk of death. We assume that a quarter get
vaccinated in the first week, another quarter the second week, another in the third
week, and the rest in the fourth week of availability. The result is shown in Figure 1,
which illustrates only the first couple of months. The pattern shown there would, we
predict, continue as long as immunity from the vaccine lasts and until alternative
vaccines become readily available, perhaps three or four months from the beginning.
Uptake of the Russian vaccine in the second and subsequent months would follow the
same pattern, with everything starting a month or two later (but likely ending a
month or two sooner as alternative vaccines become available in late 2020 or early
2021). How many would take up the Russian vaccine in the second month of
availability is not easy to know, perhaps two-thirds of the 20% who now say they
would "Wait and see for a month or so". So too for the third month for the 23% who
now say they would "Wait and see for several months". A few, perhaps a third, of the
14% who now say they would "Probably never take it" might relent at some point. All
this would protect an additional 33% (viz [ 2/3]*20% + [2/3]*23% + [1/3]*14% = 33%),
bringing the total protected to 53%. This second wave would save more lives, perhaps
as many again as saved by the first month's cohort. For simplicity we do not graph
these possibilities in Figure 1.
We assume that some people would have a bad reaction to the vaccine, pessimistically
taking the worst recent experience as our model, namely the 1976 swine flu vaccine.
Approximately 45 million people were vaccinated then, resulting in 53 deaths due to
the vaccine (Millera et al. 2015). Scaling that up to the current US population of 300
million, that corresponds to some 350 vaccine-related deaths. This in a coronavirus
epidemic which had already killed some 200,000 as of September 2020 (and more
subsequently). So even under these pessimistic assumptions, vaccine-caused deaths
are small in the big picture, almost negligible – indeed orders of magnitude less than
coronavirus-caused deaths (Figure 1, in red).
With the wisdom of hind-sight (as of early 2021), deaths from the various vaccines
eventually approved in Russia, China, Canada, Britain, and the EU have been vastly
safer than the US 1976 swine flu vaccine, killing few if any of those vaccinated. So
fears of the dangers of coronavirus vaccines have turned out to be grossly exaggerated
(although not uncommon in the lay public and not unknown even in medical circles).
6.2. Implications
The results of our rough and ready calculations are shown in Figure 1. If use of the
Russian coronavirus vaccine had been permitted in the US, our analysis implies that
at least 40 to 100 US lives would have been saved each day after the first month of
availability. The benefits ramp up in the first month, as vaccination proceeds
throughout the month. (This is again the "ethnographic present" of September 2020; in
the event, the Russian vaccine seems to be even more effective than our most
13

optimistic estimate, and so the number of US lives that could have been saved would
be even more than our 100 per day.)
Many more lives would be saved subsequently, both from the on-going immunity
among the first wave vaccinated, and from subsequent cohorts accepting vaccination.
The benefits would continue at least until US vaccines become fully available and fully
accepted, perhaps sometime in 2021.
Figure 1.
Estimated American lives saved each day (shown in green) or lost each day (shown in red) if
use of the Russian coronavirus vaccine was permitted in the US in the autumn of 2020
before US vaccines are available. Vaccine uptake estimated from two national surveys in
September (International Social Science Survey, Round 21, US Cohorts 7 & 8; combined N=
2,280). Vaccine risks are worst-case estimates based on what was known in September
2020. Vaccine effectiveness (% of infections prevented) is estimated alternatively as very
low (25%), low (50%), or good (75%). Deaths in the absence of vaccination are estimated as
700 per day based on rates observed in the autumn of 2020. Estimates shown are for the
approximately 20% of Americans who say they would take up the Russian vaccine "right
away". The 30% or 40% who would "wait and see" for a month or more are not included;
their outcomes would be in similar in pattern but starting a month or more later.

How many lives would be saved depends heavily on how effective the vaccine turns out
to be in preventing COVID-19 infection. But even if it is a very poor vaccine,
preventing only 25% of infections (far below what the FDA considered adequate), it
would still save a lot of lives. The reason is that "getting vaxed" hardly ever kills
anyone (the red line in Figure 1) so that almost any prevention a vaccine gives is a
gain. Saving some lives while waiting for a better alternative to emerge is better than
our current policy of doing nothing, which saves none and costs many lives.
A vaccine that is 50% effective in preventing infection (the minimum the FDA
considers adequate) would do much better, saving around 70 lives per day after the
14

first few weeks (solid green line in Figure 1). And that protection would continue
months into the future, assuming that immunity once established continues for at
least some months (as is usually the case for vaccines against other coronaviruses).
And all this comes from vaccinating just 20% of the population; vaccinating more
would save more.
Finally, a vaccine that is 75% effective (good but not unusually good – and probably
even less that 20-20 hindsight reveals) would, we estimate, save something like 100
lives per day after it has been deployed for a while (Figure 1, dashed line in green, for
weeks 5 onward).
What, then, do the American people think about this?
7. A two-to-one majority believe Americans should be allowed to buy the Russian
vaccine
The question, asked in our two September surveys:
In the US, well-meaning government regulations ban new medicines –
including coronavirus vaccines – until the FDA approves them as
"safe and effective". But the FDA is slow and cautious. The faster,
but slightly riskier Russian system has a vaccine available months
before the USA, leaving Americans at risk of getting coronavirus,
and dying of it, for months longer than Russians...
Should Americans be allowed to
want?
15% Yes!!
36% Yes
24% ??
15% No
10% No!!
(100% Total; mean=.58; 2,355

cases; September 2020)

The percentages on the left in green are the percent distribution of the answers.
Scoring for the regression is shown on the right, also in green (it approximates
probabilities). Respondents did not see any of the material in green.
A majority of Americans believe they should be allowed to buy Russian vaccines if they
want, 51% (viz 15% + 36% ). Only 25% are opposed (15% + 10%), so that is a two-toone majority in favor (recall this is still the "ethnographic present" of September,
2020).
Quite a few are, however, undecided, 24%. If the question were put to a referendum
where the undecided had to make up their mind one way or another, or abstain
altogether, the likely result would be 58% in favor and 42% opposed.
All this is equally true of the Chinese vaccines (the question was asked immediately
following the Russian question):
15

. . .
Should Americans be allowed to
want?
13% Yes!!
35% Yes
23% ??
17% No
12% No!!
(100% Total; mean=.55; 2,348

(scored 1.00)
(scored 0.75)
(scored 0.50)
(scored 0.25)
(scored 0.00)
cases; September 2020)

So Chinese and Russian vaccines are viewed in much the same way. Perhaps
surprisingly since Russia is more developed economically although not more advanced
scientifically. And Americans are quite accustomed to buying things from China.
Demographic and socioeconomic differences in opinion
Demographic and socioeconomic differences of opinion about buying foreiign vaccines
are small (Table 3). Men are a trifle more in favor of being allowed to buy the Russian
vaccine (3% more t=2.36, p<.05). Blacks are 9% more favorable (t=5.22, p<.001) and
Hispanics are not (t=-0.26, n.s.). Neither young nor old are significantly different than
the middle aged. Nor are well educated university graduates significantly different
from those with less education. Income is irrelevant.

The only real socioeconomic difference that is that those at the top of the occupational
hierarchy (professors, lawyers, engineers and other higher professionals) are around
8% more supportive than those near the bottom of the hierarchy (like unskilled
laborers; t=2.76, p<.01). Concretely, 62% of typical higher professionals believe they
16

should be allowed to buy the 'Sputnik V' vaccine while only 55% of otherwise similar
unskilled workers think that – hardly a big difference. Notice that these are
differences only in the size of the majority.
There are no significant partisan differences either (t= -1.68, p=.09). This is unlike
many other aspects of the coronavirus epidemic where partisan differences are strong
and often heated.
So far as we are aware, these question have not previously been asked.
8. Conclusion
We have argued that making the Russian coronavirus vaccine 'Sputnik V' immediately
available in the US would have saved approximately 40 to 100 American lives each
day after the first month of availability. Many more would be saved subsequently,
both from the on-going immunity among the first wave vaccinated, and from
subsequent cohorts accepting vaccination. The benefits would continue at least until
US vaccines become fully available and fully accepted. The benefits of allowing
Chinese vaccines to be bought in the US would be similar. Allowing both would be a
little better (a few Americans would use one but not the other and supply of the two
would probably be less of a constraint).
Making the Russian vaccine immediately available for Americans to buy if they want
to is a policy supported by a two-to-one majority of the nation. That is a policy
supported by rich and poor, young and old, Democrat and Republican alike. Public
opinion is no hindrance to adopting it. Only the US government is a hindrance.
Recall that we are still speaking in the "ethnographic present" of September 2020.
Evaluating a public policy on the basis of 20-20 hindsight is neither a fair nor an
informative way of judging the actions of the time. Suffice it to say that applying 20-20
hindsight (as of April 2021) amply confirms conclusions from September 2020.
Leaving the "ethnographic present" of September 2020 for the benefits of hindsight
note that current US government policy still prevents Americans from getting the
existing Russian vaccine, or indeed from getting vaccines already approved and
widely distributed in China, Canada, Britain and the EU.
By forcibly preventing Americans from buying the vaccines early on, the US
government puts itself in an untenable moral position by most tenants of moral
philosophy (Bentham, Kant, Locke) and political philosophy ("We hold these truths to
be self-evident ... unalienable Rights ...").
To put the matter bluntly, American policy has killed many dozens of people each day
for months toward the end of 2020 and early in 2021.
To put that in context, all American murderers combined kill about 45 people each
day.
One key issue is a moral one: Is it better to be almost absolutely safe for those who
eventually take the FDA-approved vaccine at the cost of deaths every day to people
who today would have taken Sputnik-V and other vaccines that have not completed
17

the FDA approval process? Does the tiny risk of a bad vaccine reaction causing death
justify preventing people from making up their own minds how they weight that tiny
risk against the risk they face without taking the vaccine? Or should the scientists
stick to the science and provide the best information currently available – and best
estimates based on past experience about the relative risks – leaving to the citizenry
the right to make up their own minds about how they weigh those risks and to have
access to the Russian vaccine if they want it? Our current system has killed dozens of
people each day – people who would have survived had they been allowed to take the
vaccine, as they wished. Is our system justified in inflicting these deaths on unwilling
victims on the say-so of unelected (albeit well-meaning) medical bureaucrats with
views of risk and morality which differ greatly from those of the majority of
Americans?
To put the moral issue bluntly, true believers are the most dangerous zealots, as
Savonarola most painfully illustrated centuries ago. The FDA has blood on its hands.

9.1 APPENDIX 1: THE MODEL
Our underlying model is described in Sections 4 and 5.1 above.
It is implemented in a straightforward Excel spreadsheet described here. The
spreadsheet is freely available for downloading on our website (URL temporarily
suppressed for blind review).
Basic assumption: If vaccination reaches 20% of the population and protects (say) 50%
of those vaccinated from subsequent infection, then it reduces the rate of infection –
and the death rate – by 10% (viz .20 * .50 = .10).
The model covers those who intend to get vaccinated "right away", which we take to be
in the first month (see Section #3). These are the results shown in Section #5,
Figure 1.
Those who expect to be vaccinated in the 2 nd or subsequent months would follow the
same logic and essentially the identical model but starting in the 2 nd or subsequent
months. These results are briefly discussed in text but not shown numerically.
The following calculations for those who intend to get vaccinated "right away" are
repeated for each week; 9 weeks are shown in Figure 1. The first 4 weeks are the
establishment period as the Russian vaccine is taken up. Subsequent periods are the
stable state for the cohort of people who took up the vaccine "right away".
These calculations are repeated for each week:
pctVax = cumulative proportion of population vaccinated by that week
(assumption: # accepting vaccination spread evenly over 4 weeks)
nNewVax = Week1: pctVax in week 1 * US_population in millions
Week2 onward: (pctVax this week – pctVac previous week) * US_population

18

vaxKill = nNewVax * ( number dying from the vaccine per day)
(assume: worst case estimate from 1976 swine flu vaccine. For simplicity assume deaths happen immediately
upon vaccination.)
covidKill = number dying from COVID-19 each day
(from observed data; assume is the same each week)
vaxProtect = 0.50
(alternate assumptions shown [ 25, .50, .75]; same each week)
vaxEffectv = pctVax * covidKill * vaxProtect
vaxSave = vaxEffectv – vaxKill

Nomenclature in different literatures emphasizes different points on the vaccination spectrum, with
those focusing on the positive agentic end usually talking about vaccination "intention", those focusing
on the positive end, but viewing the general public as largely passive, talking about "receptivity", those
focusing on the middle, or lower middle, talking about "vaccine hesitancy" and those focusing on the low
end talking about vaccine "resistance" or "refusal". But insofar as their measurement includes the whole
spectrum, these literatures all address the same substantive issue, employ similar predictor variables,
and typically yield very similar findings, allowing for the reversal of signs, depending on which end of
the spectrum is defined as "up".
