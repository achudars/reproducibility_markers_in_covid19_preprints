Abstract
This study provides preliminary evidence regarding associations between socioeconomic
inequalities and variations in the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases across 923
municipalities in Catalonia, Spain, as of the 14th of May, 2020. We consider three types of
inequalities at municipality-level: 1) economic development, i.e., unemployment rate, average
income, immigrants proportion, and the prevalence of small residence; 2) health vulnerability,
i.e., crude death rate and the proportion of elderly (aged 65 +) population; and 3) information
communication, i.e., the proportion of people with tertiary education. In addition to the static
analysis with the total sum of COVID-19 cases, the dynamic analysis with daily moving weekly
sum of cases is conducted. The result draws a rather complex picture of relationships between
contextual socioeconomic inequalities and the spread of COVID-19. Many indicators of
economic inequalities imply the opposite relationship as intuitively suggested: economically
disadvantaged municipalities tend to have less cases of confirmed infection than economically
advantaged counterparts. The implications from health inequality indicators show mixed
patterns: crude death rate is positively associated, but elderly population is negatively associated,
with the number of confirmed cases. The indicator of information inequality shows a consistent
tendency, i.e., municipalities with more university educated have less confirmed cases, but this
tendency transforms across time: the negative association is particularly strong during the first
month of Spanish “state of alarm” measure (mid-March to mid-April). Our evidence suggests the
need for more careful consideration regarding the association between socioeconomic
inequalities and the regional progression of COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), is now responsible for the worst global pandemic since Spanish flu in the early
20th century (1). As of May 14th, 2020, Spain is one of the most severely hit countries in the
current pandemic: the second most confirmed cases and the fourth most deaths in Europe (2).
Within Spain, however, not all regions are equally affected by COVID-19. Confirmed cases of
COVID-19 are concentrated in two autonomous communities, Madrid and Catalonia, as these
communities comprise 52.8% (28.6% in Madrid, 24.2% in Catalonia) of total confirmed cases in
the country (229,540) on the 14th of May. Furthermore, within these communities, there are huge
variations at the municipality level. Some municipalities experience significantly severer
COVID-19 outbreaks than other municipalities. Focusing especially on Catalonia, this study
examines how the spread of COVID-19 is associated with municipality-level social and
economic inequalities.

The advancement of COVID-19 pandemic in Catalonia
The first positive case of COVID-19 in Catalonia was confirmed on the 27th of February, 2020
at Barcelona.1 Since then, the number of confirmed cases in Catalonia increased exponentially,
reaching 55,482 at the time of writing (the 14th of May, 2020). During this period, the Spanish
and the Catalonian governments implemented several measures to prevent the spread of
COVID-19. Namely, the Spanish government announced "the state of alarm" on the 14th of
March (expected to expire on the 24th of May at the time of writing), preceded by the series of
recommendations published on the 9th of March. These measures order people to stay home and

limit travels on public roads and streets except for the essential activities such as purchasing
essential items (e.g., foods, pharmaceuticals), attending health centers, going to work, returning
to the usual residence, and caring for vulnerable families (3). The Catalonian government also
implemented measures to lockdown municipalities, starting with four municipalities (Igualada,
Odena, Vilanova del Cami, and Santa Margarida de Montbui) on the 12th of March. Our analysis
covers the entire period from the 27th of February to the 14th of May, but pays special attention

3

to the two months period following the week of the 9th, 12th, and 14th of March, when
governments started to implement a series of preventive measures.
To grasp regional variations in the spread of COVID-19 in Catalonia, Figure 1 shows the
municipality-level confirmed cases per 10,000 population. It shows that there are significant
variations in the prevalence of COVID-19 cases across municipalities.2 Then, Figure 2 shows
time trends in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Catalonia from the 25th of
February to the 14th of May among the most severely hit municipalities. The important
observation here is that there are variations in when the acceleration of spreads occurs. Some

municipalities experience the boost in confirmed cases in the early stage while others show the
significant increase in relatively later days.

How can inequality matter in pandemic
Compared to known diseases, novel diseases like pandemic flu were often thought to “hit the
rich and the poor alike.” However, the spread of novel infectious diseases is not equally
distributed by individual’s or region’s socioeconomic characteristics (4, 5). Early research on
Spanish flu in 1918, which is the worst pandemic the world has ever experienced, argued that the
poor are affected more severely than the rich both in terms of morbidity and mortality (6–8).
More rigorous evidence from recent studies suggests the mortality rate of Spanish flu is higher
among socially-disadvantaged minority ethnic groups (9), individuals residing in smaller
apartments (10), residents of districts with higher illiteracy rate (11), and low-skilled workers
(12). Note that compared to mortality, evidence on morbidity is rather mixed. For example,
research based on the survey conducted in Bergen, Norway between 1918 and 1919 reports that
poorer (measured by smaller apartment size) experienced a higher rate of morbidity during the
first wave of Spanish flu (July-September 1918) but a lower rate of morbidity in the second wave
(October-December 1918) (13).
Evidence from 2009 H1N1 pandemic flu similarly suggests the socioeconomic disparity
plays an important role in explaining the contraction and fatality of the illness. In the US, rates of
both hospitalization and death from pandemic flu were reported to be higher among ethnic
minorities, especially Hispanics (14, 15). Survey-based US study additionally finds that the lack
of workplace policies such as paid sick leave is positively correlated with the contraction of

5

influenza-like illness during the 2009 pandemic (16). In England, the mortality rate of this
pandemic flu was three times higher for residents of the most socioeconomically deprived
quintile than those living in the least deprived quintile (17). Also, patient data from Spain
indicates that the pandemic flu-related hospitalization rate is higher among non-Caucasian
ethnicities and lower among those with secondary or higher levels of education (18).
Incoming preliminary evidence on COVID-19 raises similar concerns regarding the
social determinants of the outbreak severity. The evidence to date provides three major
implications. First, in the US and England, the ecological evidence emphasizes the higher rate of
infection, positive test, and death among the economically disadvantaged population and
socially-disadvantaged ethnic minorities (19, 20). While without sophisticated quantitative
analysis, similar journalistic suggestions are also made in Spain (21). Second, the series of
clinical and contextual evidence strongly suggests the elderly and those with underlying
conditions are especially vulnerable to the infection and mortality of COVID-19 (22–24). Third,
public opinion surveys on the knowledge and acts of preventive behavior in various countries
(e.g., the US, China, Egypt, Paraguay, Peru, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, among others)
suggest that educational attainment has a significant positive correlation with knowledge of
COVID-19 characteristics and this knowledge plays a key role in agreeing with and following
properly the country’s measurements (25–30).
Given the above discussion, we measure socioeconomic inequalities across municipalities
in Catalonia from three aspects: 1) Economic development: the proportion of unemployment
among people aged 15-65, average taxable base income, the proportion of immigrants outside of
the European Union, and the proportion of small size houses; 2) Health vulnerability: the crude

6

death rate in 2018 and the proportion of the elderly population (aged 65 +); 3) Information
communication: the proportion of people with tertiary education. Population, population density
and the average number of household members are included in the model to control the possible
confoundings in associations.3

Results
Figure 3 presents the cross-sectional evidence using the raw cumulative number of confirmed
cases in 923 counties of Catalonia on the 14th of May. We apply the hurdle model to estimate
associations given the nature of data (see Data and Method section): the left panel shows the
result for a hurdle component (having at least one positive case or not) and the right panel
corresponds to the result for a positive count component (positive number of confirmed cases).
Contrary to previous findings, our results caution against drawing the “simple picture”— the
socially and economically disadvantaged areas face more severe effects of pandemic virus— and
implies more complex relationships between municipality-level contexts and the spread of
COVID-19.4
As most of our predictors do not have strong associations with the hurdle component
(i.e., whether there are one or more confirmed cases or not), the following discussions focus on
associations observed in the positive count component. Many of our economic inequality
indicators show results contradicting with the expectation that poor areas are affected more than
rich areas. Municipalities with a higher proportion of unemployed, a higher average income of
residents, and a lower proportion of residents immigrated from outside of the EU have more

confirmed cases, holding all other factors constant. These patterns imply, in contrast to a
conventional expectation, economically advanced municipalities may have more confirmed cases
than their economically backward counterparts. Note that the proportion of small size houses
show a positive association (statistically significant at 10% level) with confirmed cases: the
pattern consistent with a conventional expectation. Similarly, two indexes supposing to capture
the health vulnerability have mixed results. The crude death rate in 2018 has a positive
association, but the proportion of the elderly population has a negative association, with a

8

positive number of cases of COVID-19. The only evidence that consistently supports the prior
findings is regarding the informational inequality: municipalities that have higher proportions of
tertiary educated people tend to have less confirmed cases.
Recent studies criticize the use of the number of positive cases as the proxy for the spread
of the virus. They argue that the number of confirmed cases can be an artifact of selection bias
caused by differential test accessibility across regions (31). Here, it might be the case that more
9

economically advanced municipalities confirm a higher number of COVID-19 cases because
they make tests more accessible (thus have higher ability to identify those infected), not because
they are experiencing an outbreak of higher severity.5 To partially address this issue, we construct
an additional model including the prevalence of tests (i.e., the number of tests per 100,000
population) as a control variable. If observed associations in Figure 3 are driven by the increase
in test accessibility (and not the spread of the virus), the inclusion of test prevalence as a control
should weaken those associations. Due to the fact that no positive case is confirmed if no test is
conducted, the model is estimated only for municipalities with one or more tests conducted
(N=807). Then, since the relevant dataset no longer has an excessive number of zero, the model
is estimated by negative binomial regression.6
Figure 4 illustrates the results for the additional analysis. As expected, test prevalence
(the last row) has a strong positive association with the number of positive cases. In comparison
with the right panel of Figure 3, it shows the persistent patterns of associations for economic and
informational inequalities, both in terms of direction and magnitude. Therefore, we find no
evidence that supports the claim that the variation in test accessibility drives associations
between economic/informational inequalities and confirmed COVID-19 cases. On the other
hand, associations for health vulnerability indicators are significantly weakened after controlling
for the test prevalence. Here we find the evidence consistent with the claim that associations
between municipality-level health vulnerability and confirmed COVID-19 cases are driven at
least partially by the accessibility to tests.

5

In New York, for example, it is found that poor neighborhoods are negatively associated with the number of tests,
but positively associated with the likelihood that the test was positive .
6
Given the difference in methodology and datasets, Figure 3 and Figure 4 are not fully comparable while
comparison provides some important implications. Further inquiry is required in the future studies.

10

The above cross-sectional result reveals the non-simple connections between
municipality-level socioeconomic inequality measures and the spread of COVID-19. On the
other hand, the analysis was a static snapshot taken on the 14th of May and misses the dynamic
aspect of the spreading process of COVID-19. Therefore, we calculate the daily moving weekly
sum of confirmed cases (i.e., the sum of cases confirmed within one week prior to the given date)
and analyze the dynamic trend in the relationship between regional socioeconomic

11

characteristics and COVID-19 cases by estimating the hurdle model on each date in the period
between the 14th of March and the 14th of May. Figure 5 shows the results regarding the positive
count component of the hurdle model. The relationship on the hurdle component of the hurdle
model can be found in Figure SE1 in the supplementary material.
The general pattern of associations shown in Figure 5 coincides with Figure 3, but it
provides more detailed information regarding the change in associations over time. The negative
association of unemployment is slightly increasing in time. Contrary, the positive association of
average income is weakening after the mid-April, then becomes negative in recent days. The
proportion of small house and out-of-EU immigrants show a strong association in the early
period while weakening in recent days. Lastly, the proportion of university-educated residents
shows an interesting and potentially important trend. Their associations are weak (and even
positive) in early and recent periods, but the strongest in the middle, the one month following the
“state of alarm” announcement.

Discussion
This study examined how socioeconomic inequality is associated with the COVID-19 positive
cases in 923 municipalities in Catalonia, Spain. We conducted analyses not only of the
cumulative number of confirmed cases on the current date, but also at each date during the
observed period, illustrating the dynamic change in their associations. Municipality-level
socioeconomic inequalities are measured from three aspects: 1) economic inequality, 2) health
vulnerability, and 3) informational inequality. Existing studies on COVID-19 argue for the
“simple picture,” that disadvantaged areas unilaterally experience severer effects of COVID-19.

12

However, our preliminary results imply the evidence is at best mixed when comparing
municipalities across Catalonia. These results persist even after considering the potential
selection bias caused by municipalities’ test accessibility.
Our results reveal two potentially important patterns that are worth discussion. First, in
our data, the evidence on economic inequalities and health vulnerabilities is at best mixed. Many
of our economic inequality indicators and the proportion of elderly even show opposite
associations as expected: economically disadvantaged and elderly-populated municipalities tend
to have fewer cases of COVID-19. Here, it is easy to conclude that ecological associations do not
necessarily coincide with individual-level associations. On the other hand, this finding may
imply the important role of community-level socioeconomic structure in the spread of
COVID-19. For example, the positive association of income may suggest that municipalities in
which richer people reside involve more frequent physical movements in and out of
municipalities (e.g., commuting from homes in the suburbs to offices in the city). Those
movements may have brought7 and spread the virus. If interpreted this way, the negative
association of unemployment rate and the positive association of immigrants’ proportion may
also be reasonable: People with lower socioeconomic status are known to make physical
movements within a smaller radius (32), thus expected to contribute less to the spread of the
virus through movements in and out of municipalities.
Second, if the spread of COVID-19 is analyzed as dynamic rather than a static
phenomenon, patterns of associations between municipality-level characteristics and the spread
of COVID-19 transform across time. Especially, we found that the negative association between

By “bring,” see also the left panel of Figure 3. The average income has a positive and statistically significant (at
5% level) association in the hurdle component of the hurdle model (i.e., increases the non-zero confirmation of
COVID-19 cases).

informational advantage (measured by the high proportion of university graduates) and the
COVID-19 confirmed cases is particularly strong (and otherwise weaker) during the one month
immediately following the “state of alarm” intervention by the Spanish government. This pattern
may imply that informational advantage may help municipalities to quickly make appropriate
responses to the preventive measure (through higher levels of correcting information and of
understanding the situation among residents). This advantage, on the other hand, tends to
disappear in the recent period as the situation progresses and intentions of preventive measures
penetrate to a larger population.
At least two caveats remain in the current analysis. Firstly, since the unit of analysis in
our dataset is a municipality, it is risky to connect our findings directly to patterns at
individual-level. However, municipality-level analysis has its own advantages. Since preventive
measures in the pandemic can only be enforced at the aggregate level, there is an independent
advantage to explore the patterns of the spread of the virus through aggregate data. Secondly, our
current analysis only looks at the number of positive cases. Here, patterns in the severity of a
disease, such as rates of hospitalization and mortality, represent another critical aspect of the
current pandemic. We have not yet been able to obtain such data for municipalities of Catalonia,
but if data become available, future research must explore the implication of municipality-level
socioeconomic inequality for aspects of the current pandemic beyond the number of positive
cases.

Data and Method
We obtain the daily data on the spread of COVID-19 in Catalonia from dades obertes Catalunya
(https://analisi.transparenciacatalunya.cat) and other municipality-level statistics from the
Statistical Institute of Catalonia (https://www.idescat.cat) and the 2011 Spanish Census
(https://www.ine.es/censos2011_datos/cen11_datos_resultados_seccen.htm).

Out

of

947

municipalities in Catalonia, the main analysis includes all municipalities that have relevant
statistics available (N = 923).
To estimate the association between COVID-19 cases and social and economic
inequality, we use the hurdle model in the main analysis (33).8 Given that a significant fraction of
Catalonian municipalities has zero cases of COVID-19, the hurdle model explains the number of
COVID-19 confirmed cases in two stages. First, the hurdle component model explains if there is
a positive count or not (estimated by binomial logit). Second, the positive count model explains
the variation in the non-zero count of confirmed cases (estimated by negative binomial
regression). This way, the hurdle model copes with the issue of heteroskedasticity caused by the
excess number of zeros in the dependent variables. In the first analysis shown in Figure 3, we use
cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 until the 14th of May, 2020 per municipality as a
dependent variable. In the second analysis (Figure 5), we calculate the moving weekly sum of
confirmed cases (i.e., the sum of cases confirmed in a week prior to the given date) and estimated
its association with regional characteristics daily to assess changes in patterns during the period
from the 14th of March to the 14th of May, 2020.

The analysis in Figure 4 uses negative binomial regression instead of the hurdle model due to reasons described in
the Results section.
