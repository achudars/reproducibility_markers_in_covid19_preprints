Abstract
Scenarios used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are central to climate
science and policy. Recent studies find that observed trends and International Energy Agency
(IEA) projections of global CO2 emissions have diverged from emission scenario outlooks widely
employed in climate research. Here, we quantify the bases for this divergence, focusing on Kaya
Identity factors: population, per-capita GDP, energy intensity (energy consumption/GDP), and
carbon intensity (CO2 emissions/energy consumption). We compare 2005-2017 observations and
IEA projections to 2040 of these variables, to “baseline” scenario projections from the IPCC’s
Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), and from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) used in the
upcoming Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). We find that the historical divergence of observed CO2
emissions from baseline scenario projections can be explained largely by slower-than-projected
per-capita GDP growth—predating the COVID-19 crisis. We also find carbon intensity divergence
from baselines in IEA’s projections to 2040. IEA projects less coal energy expansion than the
baseline scenarios, with divergence expected to continue to 2100. Future economic growth is
uncertain, but we show that past divergence from observations makes it unlikely that per-capita
GDP growth will catch up to baselines before mid-century. Some experts hypothesize high enough
economic growth rates to allow per-capita GDP growth to catch up to or exceed baseline scenarios
by 2100. However, we argue that this magnitude of catch-up may be unlikely, in light of:
headwinds such as aging and debt, the likelihood of unanticipated economic crises, the fact that
past economic forecasts have tended to over-project, the aftermath of the current pandemic, and
economic impacts of climate change unaccounted-for in the baseline scenarios. Our analyses
inform the rapidly evolving discussions on climate and development futures, and on uses of
scenarios in climate science and policy.

1. Introduction
Scenarios are central to climate change science: connecting physical and social research on
projected impacts, and underpinning discussions of adaptation and mitigation. Scenarios are used
in both exploratory analyses—sometimes intentionally extreme—and policy-relevant projections,
where realism is more important (Pielke and Ritchie 2020). These analyses serve different
functions, and should be evaluated differently. Here we focus on policy-relevant uses of scenarios
to inform near- and long-term projections. Such scenarios are useful to the extent that they
accurately capture real-world trends; inaccurate scenarios can mislead.
The IPCC has long used “marker scenarios” to represent a family of scenarios sharing a particular
storyline or pathway (Nakicenovic et al. 2000). Recent marker scenarios are associated with
Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)—each with different radiative forcing in 2100.
The RCPs did not originally intend to specify socioeconomic pathways (Moss et al. 2010), but the
RCPs were selected from socioeconomic pathways from integrated assessment modeling groups
for marker scenarios producing radiative forcing levels of 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 watts/meter2 (RCPs
2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5). Scenarios developed for the forthcoming IPCC AR6 associate five “Shared
Socioeconomic Pathways” (SSPs) with a second generation of RCPs. These RCPs include new
forcing levels of 1.9, 3.4 and 7.0 watts/meter2 (O’Neill et al. 2014; Riahi et al. 2017; IIASA 2018;
Rogelj et al. 2018).
IPCC Working Groups I and II typically utilize 4 or more marker scenarios to project future climate
and impacts. However, in practice, research often emphasizes low- and high-forcing scenarios, in
ways that can give the impression (Hausfather and Peters 2020) that: the high-forcing scenario is
business as usual (BAU) or its equivalent, the low-forcing scenario is what can be achieved through
mitigation, and the difference in projected impacts reflects benefit of mitigation (or the cost of not
mitigating). For instance, the 2019 IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a
Changing Climate (SROCC) (IPCC 2019) focused on RCPs 2.6 and 8.5, and the 2018 U.S.
National Climate Assessment (USNCA) (U.S. Global Change Research Program 2018) similarly
emphasized RCPs 4.5 and 8.5. These reports avoided the phrase “business as usual”, but used
RCP8.5 as a reference scenario (Pielke and Ritchie 2020).
IPCC Working Group III solicits scenario submissions and approved 1,184 scenarios for AR5,
classifying each as either: baseline scenarios (a.k.a. “BAU”, “no-policy”, or “reference”; IPCC
WGIII 2014; Rogelj et al. 2016) modeling futures without climate or energy policies (some
exclude existing policies); or “mitigation” (a.k.a. “policy”) scenarios incorporating explicit climate
or energy policies. Baseline scenarios, and their aggregate distribution, are often used as
counterfactuals for assessing mitigation challenges and benefits (e.g., Rogelj et al. 2016). The
median of AR5 WGIII baseline CO2 emissions was closest to RCP8.5, among the RCPs (Figure
1a).
Hausfather and Peters (2020) note that global fossil-fuel CO2 emissions fall below the pathway
underlying RCP8.5 and argue this divergence will widen, noting the International Energy
Agency’s (IEA) projections to 2040 under its “Current Policies” scenario (assuming continuity in
enacted energy and climate policies) (IEA 2019a). Hausfather and Peters (2020) conclude that

2

RCP8.5 should not be used as a reference scenario, and that RCP4.5 or RCP6 (generally consistent
with ~3ºC of warming by 2100) offer more realistic baselines (see also Raftery et al. 2017).1
To inform improved climate scenarios and understandings of medium-term (2020-2040) to longterm (2020-2100) futures, we quantify factors underlying the divergence between (a) AR5 and
SSP baseline scenarios (IPCC WGIII 2014; IIASA 2018) and (b) both observations (IEA 2019b)
and energy-outlook projections (BP 2019; EIA 2019; ExxonMobil 2019; IEA 2019a)—focusing
on the 2019 IEA World Energy Outlook (IEA 2019a). We focus on the four drivers of energyrelated CO2 emissions of the Kaya identity (Kaya and Yokoburi 1997):
(1)

CO2 emissions = population x GDP per capita x energy intensity x carbon intensity,

where ‘energy intensity’ is primary energy/GDP, and ‘carbon intensity’ is CO2 emissions/primary
energy. Our comparisons are both global and regional (using IPCC region definitions; IPCC WGIII
2014).
2. Methods
2.1. Comparing fossil-fuel CO2 emissions
We compare fossil-fuel CO2 emission projections from AR5 and SSP baselines2, RCP marker
scenarios, and BAU-like energy outlook scenarios (see Supplementary Materials (SM), Table
S1) (shown in Figures 1, S1). This comparison requires harmonization, as AR5 Working Group
III and SSP databases (IPCC WGIII 2014; IIASA 2018) include baseline scenarios of combined
fossil-fuel and industry (FF&I) CO2 emissions, while energy outlooks report only fossil-fuel CO2
emissions. We apply Ritchie and Dowlatabadi’s (2017) harmonization procedure (see SM).
2.2. Comparing Kaya-Identity-factor growth rates
We compare observed Kaya factor growth rates to AR5 WGIII and SSP baseline scenarios
(IPCC WGIII 2014; Riahi et al. 2017; IIASA 2018). For consistency, we utilize observations of
all Kaya factors from IEA’s CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion 2019 Highlights (IEA
2019b), which has annual country-level data from 1971-2017. The SSP database (IIASA 2018)
reports GDP in purchasing power parity (PPP) units, while the AR5 WGIII database (IPCC
WGIII 2014) reports GDP using market exchange rates (MER), both in constant USD. The IEA

1

A recent study by Schwalm et al. (2020) projects that cumulative CO2 emissions under the IEA’s Current Policies
scenario (CPS) will track RCP8.5 more closely than other RCPs to 2050, but they arrive at this conclusion by
assuming that future land-use emissions (which the IEA does not project) will be substantially higher than any of the
SSPs anticipate, thus compensating for RCP8.5’s under-projection of CO2 emissions from fossil fuels (Riahi et al.
2017).
2
We focus on these scenarios as they are the basis for Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) and the
more recent CMIP6 which provided the scientific evidence base for AR5 and AR6 (Eyring et al. 2016), but we note
that other integrated assessment model scenarios besides these databases have been developed, such as those used in
the IPCC Special Report: Global Warming of 1.5°C (IPCC 2018), which were narrower in scope—focusing on
“1.5°C and related scenarios” (IIASA 2019). Analyzing a broader range of IAM scenarios is beyond the scope of the
present study.

(2019b) reports both measures; thus, we use MER GDP when comparing to the AR5 WGIII
database, and PPP GDP when comparing to the SSP database.
We compare (a) the annual continuous growth rate in each Kaya factor in each IPCC region (see
SM for harmonization procedure) from 2005 (the year most AR5 and SSP scenarios begin
projecting) to 2017 (latest year in IEA 2019b) in the observations, to (b) the 2005-2020 annual
continuous growth rate in the AR5 WGIII and SSP databases. We calculate the annual
continuous growth rate (g) in a factor, X, between year 2005 and year t (2017 or 2020) as (%/y):

For each baseline scenario in the AR5 WGIII and SSP databases, we calculate the ‘growth error’
(denoted E) for each Kaya factor as the difference between the projected (2005-2020) and
observed (2005-2017) annual growth rates, g (shown in Figure 2):

We perform sensitivity analyses (shown in Figure S2) regarding economic growth, removing the
years 2008-2009 to show short-term effects of the Great Recession, and adding the International
Monetary Fund’s (IMF) April 2020 World Economic Outlook (WEO) estimates and projections
of 2018-2020 per-capita GDP growth, which include projections of COVID-19 impact (IMF
2020a,b).
We follow a similar procedure to calculate divergences between: (a) IEA’s Current Policies and
Stated Policies scenarios, and (b) each baseline scenario for 2020-2040 (Figures 1b, S3, Table
S2). The IEA reports GDP projections to 2040 in PPP units; thus, Figure 1b shows the
comparison with SSP baselines3. We focus at the global level, because the IEA (2019a) uses
different regional classifications than the IPCC.
We compare (a) per-capita GDP growth rates (constant-dollar PPP) projected by SSP baselines
to (b) the IMF’s October 2019 WEO (IMF 2019, 2020b) projections to 2024 and April 2020
WEO (IMF 2020a,b) projections to 2021 (shown in Figure 3). Because the SSPs project percapita GDP on five-to-ten-year intervals, we assume a constant continuous growth rate within
each interval. We calculate these growth rates by linearly interpolating log-transformed percapita GDP within each region-model-scenario combination.
2.3 Catch-up rates for per-capita GDP growth
Given uncertainties and debates surrounding future economic growth, we calculate ‘catch-up’
rates for per-capita GDP growth from 2020-2040 and from 2020-2100, defined as the rates of
growth needed for overall 2005-2040 or 2005-2100 growth to match each baseline scenario,

3

We show the comparison with AR5 baselines in Figure S3, but caution that using PPP units produces higher global
growth rates (because poor countries receive higher weights), and thus the comparison is imperfect for per-capita
GDP and energy intensity growth.

given past discrepancies. We specifically calculate three different ‘catch-up’ scenarios, shown in
Figure 4.
First, we assume 2005-2017 average growth rates continue through 2020. In this scenario,
‘catch-up’ rates (denoted G40 for 2020-2040 and G100 for 2020-2100) are calculated as:
(4a)

BC2 = !1212,12C26789 + 0.755.

(4b)

BH22 = !1212,1H226789 + IHKL 5.

J

Here, !1212,12C26789 and !1212,1H226789 denote projected 2020-2040 and 2020-2100 per-capita
GDP growth rates [calculated analogously to equation (2)] in each AR5 and SSP baseline
scenario4.
Second, we extend the 2005-2017 per-capita GDP growth time series to include the April 2020
IMF WEO (IMF 2020a,b) estimates and projections from 2018-2021. These include their
projected COVID-19 impact on 2020 and 2021 growth assuming a V-shaped recovery (Figure
3), which some economists consider overly optimistic (e.g., Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
2020). This increases the calculated growth error (E) in equation (4) above, and thus also the
calculated catch-up rates (which are now calculated from 2021-2040 and 2021-2100). Third, we
simulate a doubling of the COVID-19 effect on the growth of each region by doubling the
difference between the average 2020-2021 growth rate and the 2018-2019 growth rate observed.
To generate per-capita GDP by IPCC region from the (country-level) IMF data, we sum GDP
and population across the countries in each region, and then divide the resulting total GDP by
total population5.
We compare these ‘catch-up’ rates to the range of 2010-2050 and 2010-2100 per-capita GDP
growth rates projected by a group of macroeconomists surveyed by Christensen et al. (2018) (see
SM for harmonization procedure).
3. Results
From 2005 to 2017, energy CO2 emissions grew slower than in 83% of AR5 and 73% of SSP
baseline scenarios (Figures 1a, 2). Consequently, emissions tracked near the low end of the
baseline scenario ranges (Figures 1a, S1). Even before COVID-19, reference energy outlooks (BP
2019; EIA 2019; ExxonMobil 2019; IEA 2019a) projected that this divergence will continue to
2040, such that energy emissions would lie below the entire ranges of AR5 (Figure 1a) and SSP
(Figure S1) baseline scenarios.

4

We multiply E by 0.75 (3/16) because the catch-up period, 2020-2040 (2020-2100), is 20 (80) years, compared to
the 15-year period (2005-2020) over which the growth error (E) occurred.
5
We use the October 2019 WEO (IMF 2019) population projections, since these are not readily calculable from the
April 2020 WEO (IMF 2020) per-capita GDP projections.

3.1 Drivers of 2005-2017 baseline scenario divergence from observations
CO2 emissions-growth divergence between baseline scenarios and observations from 2005-2017
is primarily due to baseline scenarios over-projecting per-capita GDP growth (Figure 2), with most
AR5 baselines too high in all regions except Asia (Figure 2a), and all SSP baselines too high in all
regions (Figures 2b, 3). Error magnitudes are similar in AR5 and SSP baselines.
Excluding 2008-2009 nearly eliminates growth errors in OECD countries, and significantly
reduces errors for the former Soviet Union countries (REF), but has little effect on the errors in
other regions (Figure S2), where the projection errors largely come from other years (Figure
3b,c,d).
Baseline scenario projections were limited in range but quite accurate for 2005-2017 population
growth (Figure 2)6. AR5 baseline scenarios slightly over-projected carbon intensity growth (or

We note that this makes GDP projection errors approximately equal to per-capita GDP projection errors.

under-projected its decline) in every region (Figure 2a), and similarly for SSP baselines in all
regions except Asia (Fig. 2b).
Globally, AR5 and SSP baseline energy intensity projections were consistent with observed 20052017 trends (Figure 2). However, most baseline scenarios over-projected energy intensity in the
OECD, and under-projected it in the Middle East and Africa (MAF) and Latin America and the
Caribbean (LAM) (Figure 2). These regional differences may reflect recent offshoring of energyintensive industrial activities from richer countries to poorer countries (Hardt et al. 2018). Underprojections of energy intensity in Asia, MAF, and LAM may also be related to similar-magnitude
over-projections of per-capita GDP growth (because GDP is the denominator of energy intensity)
(Figure 2).
3.2. Drivers of 2020-2040 divergence from IEA projections
The 2020-2040 divergence of SSP and AR5 baseline CO2 emissions from IEA Current Policies
and Stated Polices projections is partly due to carbon intensity—which grows more slowly (or
declines more quickly) in the IEA scenarios (Figures 1b, S3). Divergences in other factors differ
across scenarios. Projecting per-capita GDP and population is not a main focus of the IEA—they
base these projections on UN (population) and IMF (per-capita GDP) projections (IEA 2019a).
IEA projects similar 2020-2040 population growth rates as SSP and AR5 baselines (Figures 1b,
S3). IEA 2020-2040 per-capita GDP growth projections are similar to AR5 baselines (see Figure
S3 and its caption). SSP per-capita GDP growth projections vary in divergence from IEA
projections (Figure 1b). Specifically, SSP1 (“Sustainability”) and SSP5 (“Fossil-fueled
Development”) project much faster growth than IEA, while SSP3 (“Regional Rivalry”) projects
much slower growth (Dellink et al. 2017; Riahi et al. 2017). Growth in SSP1 and SSP5 is
accelerated by assuming faster productivity growth, and faster income convergence between
poorer and richer countries, due to rapid technological improvement and a greater global focus on
lowering inequality in SSP1, and rapidly increasing fossil-fuel use in SSP5. Growth is depressed
in SSP3 from assuming slower income convergence between poor and rich, and less international
trade (see table 1 in Dellink et al. 2017). Per-capita GDP growth in SSP2 (“Middle of the Road”)
and SSP4 (“Inequality”) is slightly slower than the IEA’s projections (Figure 1b) (Dellink et al.
2017; Riahi et al. 2017).
Most AR5 baselines project higher energy intensity growth than IEA (Figure S3a,b)—a difference
larger than explained by GDP unit differences (see footnote 3). Energy intensity growth (or
decline) in the SSPs diverges from IEA projections in opposite directions from per-capita GDP
divergences, as GDP is the denominator in energy intensity. These divergences offset each other
in SSP1 and SSP3 baselines relative to the IEA’s Current Policies scenario (Figure 1b, Table S2),
meaning they project similar growth rates in energy per capita (i.e. per-capita GDP x energy
intensity). However, remaining SSP baselines project faster energy-per-capita growth than IEA’s
Current Policies scenario; and all SSPs project faster energy-per-capita growth than IEA Stated
Policies scenario (Table S2, Figure S3c).
Baselines of all SSP scenarios project higher carbon intensity growth than both IEA scenarios
(Figure 1b, S3). Most AR5 and SSP baseline scenarios project that carbon intensity would not
decline (in the absence of climate policies), whereas experience of the past decade suggests that

8

factors beyond climate policy lead to carbon-intensity declines. Figure 5a illustrates the case of
coal (see also Ritchie and Dowlatabadi 2017): high-emission baselines, such as RCP8.5 and SSP58.5, project multiple-fold increases in coal demand per capita to 2100, while the IEA (2019a)
projects declining coal per capita, even under Current Policies. One reason for this discrepancy is
that high-emission baseline scenarios substantially over-projected the cost of renewable energy
sources that have been realized such as solar power relative to coal and other fossil fuels (Figure
5b). This divergence in projected coal use also drives some of the divergence in energy intensity,
as coal is a relatively inefficient energy source (e.g., Farquharson et al. 2016).

Figure 3. Per-capita GDP growth in SSP baselines (IIASA 2018) compared to data and projections (to 2021 or 2024)
from IMF (2019, 2020a,b).

3.3. Per-capita GDP ‘catch-up’ rates and future outlook
In the OECD and Asia, per-capita GDP growth rates needed to catch-up to AR5 and SSP baseline
scenarios by 2040 are higher on average than baseline projections and the range of expert
projections reported by Christensen et al. (2018), but also largely overlapping in their distributions,
even if COVID-19 impacts turn out to be double what the IMF projected in April 2020 (Figure 4).
In the other regions (LAM, MAF, and REF), catch-up by 2040 would require growth rates at the
extreme high ends of, or above, the baseline and Christensen et al. (2018) ranges (Figure 4).
Looking ahead to 2100, catch-up per-capita GDP growth rates are higher on average than baseline
projections, and have higher medians than the Christensen et al. (2018) expert range in all regions
except Asia, but also with high degrees overlap between the catch-up ranges and baseline and
Christensen et al. (2018) ranges in all regions. Christensen et al. (2018) report higher extremes,
looking to 2100, in most regions and globally (Figure 4).

and SSP (b) baseline scenarios (red), and required to catch up to baseline scenarios assuming either the IMF’s

projections, and 10th-90th percentile ranges for expert projections (Christensen et al. (2018) do not report min and

4. Discussion
Projected CO2 emissions from AR5 and SSP baseline scenarios diverge from post-2005
observations and energy agency projections to 2040 (cf. Hausfather and Peters 2020). Our analysis
shows projected per-capita GDP growth and carbon intensity are key drivers of this divergence,
with per-capita GDP growth the predominant driver of past divergence from observations, and
carbon intensity a key driver of projected 2020-2040 divergence from energy outlooks. Given that
projecting energy systems—not GDP or population—is the IEA’s main focus, it is neither
10

surprising nor illuminating that the IEA’s 2020-2040 per-capita GDP projections do not diverge
from the AR5 and SSP baselines. Indeed, projections of GDP growth by the IMF are the basis for
both the IEA’s 2020-2040 projections, and the SSP baselines’ 2005-2018 projections (Dellink et
al. 2017; IEA 2019a). Though previous studies have also noted these CO2 emission and carbon
intensity divergences (e.g., Ritchie and Dowlatabadi 2017; Hausfather and Peters 2020), our
results identify and quantify the important role of slower-than-projected economic growth.
Beyond 2040, if the trends anticipated by energy agency forecasts continue, carbon intensity will
continue diverging from AR5 and SSP baselines—especially from higher-emission scenarios such
as RCP8.5, due to the assumptions about fossil-fuel expansion in these scenarios that are
increasingly implausible. Ritchie and Dowlatabadi (2017) explore these assumptions in detail. The
IEA’s BAU-like scenarios (Current Policies and States Policies) project a gradual decline in coal
demand, in contrast to a dramatic increase in most baseline scenarios (Figure 5). Moreover, in
recent years the IEA and other energy agencies have underestimated rates of coal decline and solar
and wind growth (e.g., Carrington and Stephenson 2018). Thus, continuing carbon intensity
divergence from baseline projections would contribute to growing CO2 emission divergence from
the median AR5 and SSP ranges, even if per-capita GDP growth eventually catches up to baseline
projections.

In assessing whether the observed divergence of per-capita GDP growth (Figure 3) from AR5 and
SSP baseline projections foreshadows a longer-term divergence, we consider two broad questions.
First, to what extent do possible causes of scenarios’ past per-capita GDP growth over-projections
indicate a potential for future over-projections? Second, to what extent does past per-capita GDP
growth over-projection directly imply longer-term over-projection by requiring implausibly high
catch-up rates (Figure 4)?
It is impossible to definitively answer the first question. There is large uncertainty, and economists
disagree about the growth outlook to 2100. Some anticipate higher growth rates than AR5 and SSP
baseline scenarios project in many regions (Christensen et al. 2018), while others anticipate growth
slowing dramatically across the developed world, for structural reasons (e.g. aging populations,
debt, innovation slowdowns) unrelated to climate change (Gordon 2016; Jackson 2019). Recent
statistical economic growth projections to 2100 (Müller et al. 2019; Startz 2020) found similar
uncertainty ranges as Christensen et al. (2018) (global per-capita GDP growth between ~1%/y and
~3%/y), which make catch-up to the AR5 and SSP baselines by 2100 appear possible. We identify
six important qualifications to interpreting this analysis.
First, the period over which we evaluated per-capita GDP growth projections (2005-2017) is
relatively short and contained the Great Recession of 2008-2009. The COVID-19 crisis adds an
additional global recession to the dataset when including 2018-2020 estimates. Although this may
suggest 2005-2020 is a historically unusual period, there will be other global recessions in the
2020-2100 period, which will result in positive bias in scenario-projected future growth rates if
the possibility of such negative shocks is not accounted for in projections (Burgess et al. 2020).
Second and relatedly, authoritative economic growth forecasts, including the IMF’s (upon which
IEA’s 2020-2040 and SSPs’ pre-2018 projections are largely based; Dellink et al. 2017; IEA
2019a), have historically tended to over-project growth on average, partly due to under-projecting
business-cycle fluctuations (de Resende 2014; CBO 2019), where negative fluctuations
(recessions) tend to be larger than positive fluctuations (Bekaert and Popov 2019; Burgess et al.
2020). Other reasons for positive economic forecast biases include over-projecting productivity
growth, assuming GDP will converge to potential GDP, and political biases (e.g., de Resende
2014; CBO 2019).
Third, even if the 2008-2009 recession is anomalous, it cannot fully explain the baseline scenarios’
2005-2017 over-projections of per-capita GDP growth in developing regions. The over-projection
magnitudes in these regions are larger (~1-3%/y over 12 years) than the 2008-2009 recession alone
can explain (Figures 2, S2), and their timing (Figure 4) is more indicative of other events, such as
the Arab Spring and Syrian civil war in the Middle East and Africa (MAF) and the Venezuelan
inflation crisis in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAM). The likelihood of future periods
comparably tumultuous as the past decade should factor into emission scenario uncertainty ranges,
especially given the likelihood of climate change causing economic, social, and political upheavals
(Carleton and Hsiang 2016).
Fourth, AR5 and SSP baseline projections do not consider economic damages from climate
change, which could be sizeable and induce feedbacks that depress emissions (Woodard et al.
2018). Indeed, such feedbacks create obvious internal inconsistencies in high-emission baseline

12

scenarios. For instance, the SSP5-8.5 baseline projects currently-developing regions will have
substantially higher GDP per-capita by 2100 than currently-developed regions have today (Dellink
et al. 2017; IIASA 2018), while at the same time other studies project that a forcing level of 8.5
W/m2 in 2100 would render many of these same regions uninhabitable by 2100 (Mora et al. 2017).
In contrast, other recent models project smaller economic damages relative to GDP than the above
comparison suggests (e.g. 8.5% at 6° of warming; Nordhaus 2018; but see also Keen (2020), which
argues that such estimates are biased low for reasons similar to those discussed above).
Fifth, some demographers now anticipate substantially slower population growth than previous
UN projections suggested (e.g., only 6-9 billion people, not 10-12 billion, by 2100; Vollset et al.
2020), due to falling birth rates, especially in developing countries (Bricker and Ibbitson 2019).
Slower population growth could further reduce per-capita GDP growth by exacerbating the
economic pressures of aging populations and public debt.
Lastly, the current COVID-19 crisis may accelerate and entrench longer-term reductions in trade
and immigration flows, as countries become more cautious about the potential for disease spread
or the security of their supply chains for essential goods such as energy products. Such a scenario
would have parallels to the SSP3 storyline—which projects slower economic growth than the other
SSPs (Figure 3). The recovery from the COVID-19 also seems likely to be much slower in many
regions than the rapid V-shaped recovery the IMF projected in April 2020 (Figure 3) (e.g., see
revised projections for the U.S. in CBO 2020).
Whether inertia will keep per-capita GDP growth below 2040 or 2100 projections, even assuming
baseline projections of post-2020 growth rates are accurate, our results (Figure 4) suggest that percapita GDP growth is unlikely to catch up to baseline scenarios by 2040, but catch-up is possible
by 2100 under strong economic growth. Indeed, the range of expert projections from Christensen
et al. (2018) includes growth rates that would allow per-capita GDP to exceed the highest baseline
scenario projections by 2100. However, this does not suggest CO2 emissions exceeding highemission baseline scenario projections are necessarily plausible, given the carbon intensities in
these scenarios would still be implausible.
5. Conclusion
Recent (post-2005) trends and energy outlook projections (to 2040) of global CO2 emissions are
substantially lower than projected by baseline scenarios used in the IPCC’s Fifth (AR5) and Sixth
(AR6) Assessment Reports, and are well off-track from widely-cited high-emission marker
scenarios such as RCP8.5. We show that this divergence owes largely to per-capita GDP and
carbon intensity growth slower than projected in baseline scenarios. The gap between observed
and projected carbon intensity is very likely to continue to increase throughout the 21st century due
to the implausible assumptions high-emission scenarios make about future fossil-fuel expansion
(Ritchie and Dowlatabadi 2017). The gap between observed and projected per-capita GDP is
unlikely to close by 2040 due to inertia but is more uncertain to 2100.
We see three immediate implications of our analysis. First, if scenarios underpin research used to
inform policy, such scenarios should be kept up-to-date and corrected when divergences from realworld trends or improved projections are identified. It is unsurprising that scenarios used by the
IPCC—many developed over a decade ago—are diverging from the real world. They should be

13

updated more regularly. Second, policy-relevant climate research, including evaluations of nearterm policy options, should use or consider near-term energy scenarios (including but not limited
to the IEA’s), which are updated on an annual basis. These provide a more reliable guide to the
next several decades than century-long scenarios, which are appropriate in exploratory climate
research. Finally, in a world where climate policy is now business as usual, the historical
distinction of policy and no-policy scenarios may be obsolete, and a new approach to scenario
planning may be needed (e.g., Pielke and Ritchie 2020).
Our analysis supports the conclusions drawn by previous studies (Hausfather and Peters 2020;
Pielke and Ritchie 2020) that high-emission AR5 (RCP8.5) and high-emission AR6 (i.e. SSP3-7.0
and SSP5-8.5) baselines should not be utilized as reference scenarios in climate research. Our
findings also suggest that future scenario development efforts should consider wider ranges of
assumptions regarding economic growth due to high uncertainty in growth futures, and the
possibility that the current pandemic will bring lasting changes to the economic system.

Supplementary Methods
Harmonizing fossil-fuel CO2 projections
The Ritchie and Dowlatabadi (2017) (hereafter RD17) harmonization process uses reported AR5
and SSP oil, gas, and coal primary energy scenario data and IPCC (2006) standard CO2 emission
factors. We construct AR5 and SSP fossil-fuel-only CO2 scenarios as the sum of CO2 emissions
from projected oil, gas, and coal combustion. This calculation is shown in equation (S1) where
total fossil-fuel CO2 (denoted FCO2) is primary energy from oil (O), gas (G), and coal (K)
multiplied by the respective emission factors for each fuel source (εo , εg , εk ).
(S1)

!"#$ = #&' + )&* + +&, .

AR5 WGIII regional FF&I CO2 time series (IPCC WGIII 2014) do not report fossil-fuel primary
energy data; therefore, facilitating broader comparison with fossil fuel-only CO2 scenarios
requires an additional harmonization step to subtract industrial emissions. As the SSP Database
(IIASA 2018) includes equivalent models and base time period to the AR5 WGIII database
(IPCC WGIII 2014), and also reports regional fossil fuel primary energy data, we create a set of
regional harmonization factors from SSP baseline scenarios for AR5 baseline scenarios. This
step follows from equation (S2), where we divide the reported FF&I for each region by regional
RD17 process results, where Hr represents the regional harmonization factor and FFICO2 is a
region’s fossil fuel and industrial emissions. We then divide each corresponding AR5 regional
FF&I CO2 scenario by Hr. Regional harmonization factors applied to AR5 WGIII scenarios
ranged from 1.00 to 1.06 (and thus our results are insensitive to the precise assumptions of this
harmonization).

.

Reconciling IEA outlooks with other industry and government energy scenarios
Comparisons of published energy scenarios must account for varied primary energy accounting
conventions which can calculate the heating values of fossil-fuel combustion differently; i.e.
higher or lower heating values, and data inconsistencies (Grubler et al. 2012; Koomey et al.
2019). Accordingly, we apply a harmonization procedure inspired by Newell et al. (2018) to
standardize interagency fossil-fuel projections to a base year before then applying IEA WEO
(IEA 2019a) Current Policies Scenario emission factors. Energy scenarios compared in this way
are detailed in Table S1.

Harmonizing to IPCC regions and Kaya factors in IEA (2019b) and AR5 and SSP databases
We aggregate country-level GDP, fossil-fuel CO2 emissions, primary energy (total primary
energy supply, in IEA 2019b), and population to the IPCC regions (IPCC WGIII 2014). The IEA
(2019b) database includes some ‘other’ categories within regions, which we include in the IPCC
region that clearly corresponds (e.g., we group “Other Africa” in the IPCC region “Middle East
and Africa”). We then gather these same factors at the region level (World, ASIA, LAM, MAF,
OECD90, REF) within the AR5 WGIII and SSP databases.
We calculate the growth rate in each of the above factors using equation (2). From these, we
calculate the annual continuous growth rates in the Kaya factors over the same interval. For
instance, if gGDP denotes the growth rate in GDP, and gpop denotes the growth rate in population,
we calculate the growth rate in GDP per capita as, gpcGDP:
(S3)

456789 = 4789 − 45;5 .

Harmonization of Christensen et al. (2018) expert projections
We make two adjustments to Christensen et al.’s (2018) reported projections for our analysis in
Figure 4. First, we convert their growth rates, which are reported as discrete-time measures (see
their footnote on p. 5410), to continuous-time measures. Calling their reported annual growth
rates (from their table 1) r, we calculate the continuous equivalents, g, as:
.

(S4) 4 = 100 >ln A1 + >BCCDED.
Second, because Christensen et al. (2018) use different regional groupings, in Figure 4 we
compare growth projections from regions as follows (IPCC region-Christensen et al. (2018)
country group): World-World, ASIA-China, LAM-Middle, MAF-Low, OECD90-High, REFMiddle.

Figure S1. Panel a shows CO2 emissions in recent world energy outlooks (BP 2019; EIA 2019; ExxonMobil 2019;
IEA 2019a) vs. SSP baseline scenarios (2005-2045) (Riahi et al. 2017; IIASA 2018). Panel b compares energy
outlook projections to the IPCC AR5 range (as in Figure 1a), but now also includes all SSP scenarios (including
policy scenarios) used in CMIP6 (Riahi et al. 2017; IIASA 2018; O’Neill et al. 2016).

Figure S2. Sensitivity analyses on per-capita GDP growth comparisons. Comparisons of average annual percapita GDP growth rates between AR5 (IPCC WGIII 2014) (a) and SSP (Riahi et ai. 2017; IIASA 2018) (b)
baseline scenarios (2005-2020) relative to observations (2005-2017) (IEA 2019b). Unadjusted comparisons (same as
Figure 2) are shown in blue. Comparisons adjusted to remove the years 2008 and 2009 (i.e., the Great Recession)
from the calculation of observed growth rates are shown in purple. Comparisons adjusted, by adding in IMF (2020)
estimates from 2018-2020, are shown in pink. Boxes represent 25th-75th percentiles (white dashes indicate medians).
Lines above and below the boxes represent the full (min-max) range.

Figure S3. Differences in projected average growth rates (%/y, continuous) of Kaya identity factors, between the
IEA World Energy Outlook (IEA 2019a) (averaged from 2018-2040) and the AR5 (a, b) SSP (c) baseline scenarios
(averaged from 2020-2040) (IPCC WGIII 2014; IIASA 2018). Boxes represent 25th-75th percentiles (white dashes
indicate medians). Lines above and below the boxes represent the full (min-max) range. The IEA World Energy
Outlook (IEA 2019a) reports GDP growth in PPP units, and thus there is a mismatch in units for the AR5
comparison (AR5 scenarios use MER), which likely biases the comparisons shown for per-capita GDP (in the
negative direction) and energy intensity (in the positive direction). PPP places more weight on poorer—and fastergrowing—countries. For instance, average (continuous) global per-capita GDP growth from 2005-2017 was
1.47%/y in MER units, and 2.33%/y in PPP units—a difference larger than the divergence shown in a and b above,
for most AR5 scenarios. Thus, the difference in units likely explains what appears to be an under-projection of percapita GDP growth in panels a and b.
