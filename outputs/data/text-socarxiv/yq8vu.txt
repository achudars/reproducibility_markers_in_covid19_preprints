Studying the social determinants of COVID-19 in a data vacuum

Abstract
Objective: Many provinces in Canada are not collecting race and socio-demographic data on
COVID-19 patients. Therefore, whether COVID-19 is disproportionately affecting certain sociodemographic groups is unknown. We make creative use of existing data to fill this data vacuum
and identify the socio-demographic risk factors for COVID-19 in Canadian health regions. We
use insights from these analyses to identify potential COVID-19 for smaller geographic units.
Methods: We merge COVID-19 data with tabular census data. We use Poisson regression
models to predict cumulative counts of COVID-19 infection in health regions in Canada. We
identify potential COVID-19 hotspots by combining the insights from the analysis of risk factors
of COVID-19 in health regions with information on the socio-demographic profiles for smaller
geographic units.
Results: COVID-19 infection and mortality rates are higher in communities with larger shares of
Black, refugee, and low-income residents.
Conclusion: Our approach offers a way for researchers and policymakers to make creative use
of existing data to identify communities vulnerable to pandemics in the absence of granular data
about the spread of infection.

Significance Statement
The Canadian government is not making race and socioeconomic data on individual COVID-19
patients to researchers. There hasn’t been a systematic study that has examine whether racial
minorities, immigrants, and low-income individuals are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19.
We make creative use of existing data and identify the socio-demographic risk factors for
COVID-19 in health regions. In Canada, the smallest geographic unit for which COVID-19 data
is consistently available the health region, which is too large and too heterogeneous to capture
the spread of COVID-19 in local communities. Using the results from our analyses of health
regions and information about the socio-demographic traits of census subdivisions, we identify
hotspots for smaller geographic units. Our approach predicted several locations which later
became hotspots. Such an approach may offer a way for researchers and governments to identify
hotspots in the absence of infectious data at the local level.

Introduction
Racial/ethnic minorities and low-income groups in the U.S. and the U.K. are particularly
vulnerable to COVID-19 (Chin et al. 2020; Thebault et al. 2020). Whether this is also true in
Canada is unknown because researchers do not have access to data about the race/ethnicity or
socioeconomic status of COVID-19 patients (Ramos 2020; Siddiqi et al. 2020). Despite repeated
pleas for such data from social scientists, government officials initially responded that they have
no plans to make these data available because all groups are important and it may violate the
privacy of patients (Mulligan et al., 2020; Osman, 2020; Perkel, 2020). With mounting social
pressure, a subset of provincial governments are only now considering the possibility of making
this data available to researchers (Perkel, 2020).
Canadian researchers are primarily relying on two data sources to examine the
pattern of spread of COVID-19. The first comes from the Public Health Agency of Canada
(PHAC). These data report the daily infection and death counts for 87 health regions, but
they are not tallied by race or socioeconomic status. Furthermore, each health region
encompasses approximately 415,000 residents; thus, they are too large geographically and
too heterogeneous socio-demographically to capture the impact of COVID-19 on local
communities and specific sub-populations. The second is crowdsourced data, which relies
on self-reports of COVID-19 cases and collects individuals’ postal code (Jones 2020).
While postal code areas are small enough to represent communities, these data likely miss a
significant portion of COVID-19 cases by relying on individuals’ access to and willingness
to report their symptoms on internet sites. These data have been used to identify certain
vulnerable communities—specifically, those who live in densely populated areas or places

with higher shares of older (70+) residents—but they ignore the community’s racial and
socioeconomic composition.
Whether or not Black, immigrant, and low-income communities in Canada have
been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 is a priori unclear. Like in the U.S., Blacks
and immigrants in Canada are more economically disadvantaged than whites (Attewell et
al. 2010). The economically disadvantaged are more likely to work in frontline occupations
facing greater exposure to COVID-19. There are, however, reasons to believe that the
pattern of the COVID-19 spread will differ across the two countries. Unlike the U.S.,
Canada has universal health insurance, and Black Canadians generally report health statuses
comparable to whites, partially reflecting the fact that large shares of Black Canadians are
high-skilled immigrants and positively selected in terms of health (Lebrun & LaVeist
2013).
We fill this data void by linking aggregated COVID-19 data with tabular census
data detailing the socio-demographic profile of health regions and communities. We present
exploratory analyses identifying the risk factors for COVID-19 infection and mortality rates
in health regions. Results from this analysis are combined with information about the sociodemographic traits of smaller communities to identify potential COVID-19 hotspots on a
more granular geographic level. It is worth noting that our results are descriptive in nature
and our analysis is not meant to establish “causality”.
Methods
Data and Sample
We obtained daily counts of COVID-19 infections and deaths through May 15 for each
health region from the University of Toronto’s COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group

(Berry et al. 2020).1 We focus on 84 (out of 87) health regions. We exclude 3 regions in Yukon,
the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut because they are sparsely populated and report virtually
no cases.
We combined the COVID-19 counts with tabular data estimated from the 2016
Canadian Census. These data, downloaded from the Statistics Canada website, report the
socio-demographic profiles of health regions, census subdivisions (CSDs), and census
divisions (CDs).2 CDs are similar to U.S. counties. CSDs, which are nested within CDs, are
similar to U.S. towns or small cities. Due to privacy concerns, Statistics Canada suppresses
information when the tallied counts of CSD residents belonging to a socio-demographic
category are small. For example, if the number of Black residents in a CSD is less than 10,
the value is suppressed. To minimize biases that come from suppressed data, we defined
communities as CSDs with more than 2,000 residents or remaining areas within the CD
outside of these populous CSDs. With a median population of 6,929, these geographic areas
are smaller and represent more localized communities than health regions. There are 1,202
communities: 943 CSDs and 259 CD-specific areas outside of these CSDs.
Measures
Our outcomes are cumulative counts of COVID-19 infections and deaths through
May 15, 2020, in each health region. We focused on this date because Canadian provinces
started to re-open their economies around this time.

In the supplementary information, we include estimates using daily counts until June 15, 2020
and obtain similar results.

Our covariates are percent Black, percent foreign-born, percent refugees, percent
without proficiency in English/French, percent poor, percent with a college degree, percent
of residents 65 years and older, percent of workers in health-care, percent of workers in
agriculture,3 and the size of the geographic area. 4 Studies in other countries have identified
them as potential risk (or protective) factors for COVID-19 (Thebault 2020; Yancy 2020).
Poor residents are defined as those whose income falls below Statistics Canada’s lowincome cut-off (LICO), which is akin to the U.S. poverty line. These measures are
computed for health regions and communities by Statistics Canada. We exclude other
measures capturing socio-demographic composition (e.g., percent Asian) due to
multicollinearity (VIF>10). Earlier models also included percent Indigenous. We exclude
this covariate from our analyses for two reasons. According to media reports, COVID-19
infections and deaths of Indigenous people have been vastly undercounted (Patel 2020).
Moreover, preliminary analyses revealed that our conclusions were sensitive to the
definition used for Indigenous people (i.e., official registration, sole ancestry, primary
language used at home).
Analytical strategy
We first identify the risk factors for COVID-19 infection and mortality rates in
health regions using Poisson regression with the exposure command. Poisson regression
estimates COVID-19 counts, and the exposure option divides the estimated counts by the
population size. We present incidence rate ratios (eβ) to describe the association between
the socio-demographic traits of health regions and COVID-19 infection and mortality rates.

3

This measure captures rural/urban status.

4

After we divide by population size, it is the inverse of population density and captures low density.

We present the results using standardized covariates in the main text and unstandardized
covariates in the Supplementary Information.
We then identify potential COVID-19 hotspots by predicting the relative number
and rate of COVID-19 infections and deaths at a more granular geographic level than the
health regions. We predict these rates and counts using (a) the coefficients describing the
association between the social, demographic, and economic composition of health regions
presented in Table S3, and (b) information about the socio-demographic composition of
these smaller communities. We then use the predicted counts as weights to partition the
actual number of COVID-19 infections/deaths in a health region across its constituent
communities.5 For these analyses, we use unstandardized covariates because the
distribution of these covariates differs across health regions and communities. In our
discussion of potential COVID-19 hotspots, we discuss mainly outbreaks identified by
media reports.
Results
Descriptive results
Figure 1 presents the spatial distribution of Black, immigrant, and low-income
communities in Canada. Communities with higher shares of Black and immigrant residents are
located in Canada’s three largest cities: Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver. Outside of these
cities, Black communities are in northeast Alberta and northern Quebec. Immigrant communities
5

Toronto, Montreal, and Alberta released official COVID-19 counts for geographic units smaller than health

regions. Starting in mid-March, Alberta released daily active (but not new or cumulative) counts of COVID-19
infections for public health authorities, which are subdivisions of health regions. Starting on May 25, 2020,
Toronto reported the cumulative infection (but not death) counts. Daily “new” (but not cumulative) counts
have been available in Montreal boroughs from mid-March. Inconsistencies in data collection and reporting
preclude us from observing COVID-19 data for regions smaller than public health regions.

are also located throughout British Columbia, in southern Alberta, in northeast Alberta, and in
southern Ontario. Low-income communities are found in northern Saskatchewan, northern
Manitoba, and southern Ontario.
Figure 1 goes here.
Figure 2 shows the spatial distribution of COVID-19 infection counts and rates across the
84 health regions in our analysis. COVID-19 count rates and counts are high in Montreal,
Toronto, Vancouver, southern Alberta including Calgary, the corridor between Montreal and
Quebec City, and southwestern Ontario bordering Detroit. In some places, high rates and counts
are not coincident. Saskatchewan and northern Alberta have high COVID-19 infection and death
counts, but not high rates. Northern Quebec has high COVID-19 infection/mortality rates, but
not high counts.
Figure 2 goes here.
Multivariate analysis
Panel A in Table 1 presents the results from Poisson regression models predicting the
COVID-19 infection rates for the 84 health regions. COVID-19 infection rates are higher in
health regions with higher shares of Black residents, refugees, immigrants without
English/French proficiency, lower-income individuals, adults aged 65+ years, and health-care
workers. For example, net of other characteristics, COVID-19 infection rates double with a 1
standard deviation increase in the share of Black residents in a health region. By contrast,
COVID-19 infection rates are lower in low-density regions with higher shares of non-refugee
immigrants and workers in the agricultural industry. For example, net of other characteristics, a 1
standard deviation increase in the share of agricultural workers is associated with a 15% drop in
COVID-19 infection rates.

Table 1 goes here.
Panel B presents results from analogous analyses predicting COVID-19 mortality rates.
The results for COVID-19 mortality rates are similar to those presented in Panel A. Two
exceptions deserve mention. The share of adults 65 years and older in health regions has much
stronger implications for COVID-19 mortality rates than for COVID-19 infection rates. A 1
standard deviation increase in the share of adults 65 years and older in health regions is
associated with a 9% increase in COVID-19 infection rates. By contrast, the same change
increased COVID-19 mortality rates by a factor of 2.1 times. Another exception is that COVID19 mortality rates are lower in health regions with higher shares of workers in the healthcare
industry. A 1 standard deviation increase in the share of health care workers in the health region
is associated with a 19% decrease in COVID-19 mortality rates. Differences in COVID-19
infection rates by the share of healthcare workers in the health region are minimal. Greater
availability of healthcare personnel in one’s place of residence may mean that patients receive
the appropriate treatment when infected with the virus.
Potential COVID-19 hotspots at a more granular geographic level
Figure 3 displays the predicted COVID-19 infection and death counts and rates across the
1,202 communities (i.e., CSDs and CDs).6 A comparison of Figures 2 and 3 reveals that
considerable heterogeneity exists in the spread of the COVID-19 within health regions. As
mentioned earlier, we focus on the potential COVID-19 hotspots identified in media reports as
the location of COVID-19 outbreaks. By focusing on a lower geographic level, we find
urban/rural differences in the spread of COVID-19 between southwest Alberta near Calgary and
southeast Alberta. Northeastern (but not the rest of) Alberta and northern (but not southern)

6

Local newspapers have reported COVID-19 outbreaks in most of these communities.

Saskatchewan have seen higher numbers of infections and deaths from COVID-19. These two
regions are the home to large numbers of temporary migrant workers living in tight quarters
while they work in the oil sands. Figure 3 also highlights high COVID-19 counts and rates in
Southern Ontario along the border with Michigan and Minnesota, which are communities with
high shares of Black, immigrant, and low-income populations.
Figure 3 goes here.
We also found that our understanding of the geographic spread of COVID-19 differs
depending on how we measure its severity. Focusing on counts reveals COVID-19 hotspots in
northeastern Alberta and northern Saskatchewan. Focusing on rates, however, highlights
hotspots along the Canadian-U.S. border in the southeastern corridor between Toronto and
Montreal, in British Columbia, and in eastern Manitoba. These hotspots may emerge due to U.S.Canadian differences in the spread and containment of the virus (Coletta, 2020).
Discussion
The absence of socio-demographic data about COVID-19 patients prevents researchers
from determining whether the pandemic is disproportionately affecting certain sociodemographic groups in Canada. We fill this void by pooling COVID-19 data with tabular census
data to (a) identify the risk factors associated with COVID-19’s spread and (b) pinpoint potential
COVID-19 hotspots in smaller geographic communities.
Like in the U.S. and U.K, Black communities in Canada have been disproportionately
impacted by COVID-19. This may explain why places like Montreal, with large numbers of
Black immigrants, have emerged as Canada’s COVID-19 epicenters. In a way, these results are
surprising given that discrimination against Black communities is thought to be less severe in
Canada and Black immigrants are typically younger than Canadian-born. It also underscores the

importance of examining racial and ethnic inequalities in health in the Canadian context where
many public health officials and politicians have not seen the need to collect racial data on
grounds that documenting health inequality by race/ethnicity may lead to discrimination (Siddiqi
et al., 2020; Mulligan et al., 2020).
Immigrant groups’ vulnerability to COVID-19 may vary depending on their admission
status and proficiency in the destination country’s official languages. The zero-order association
between the percentage foreign-born in a health region and COVID-19 infection/mortality rates
is positive (in Table 2). This association, however, becomes negative when we control for the
share of refugees and of immigrants without English/French proficiency. The adjusted
association between share of refugees and COVID-19 infection/mortality rates is positive, as is
its association with the share of immigrants without English/French proficiency. Prior to their
arrival in Canada, refugees may have spent years in refugee camps with limited access to
healthcare. Immigrants with limited proficiency in the destination country’s language have lower
healthcare usage (Kirkman and Mondragon 1991). Both groups of immigrants may have more
pre-existing health conditions that render them more vulnerable to COVID-19. Other immigrants
to Canada may be less vulnerable to COVID-19 given their generally higher skill and age.
A higher share of adults 65 years and older in a health region is associated with higher
COVID-19 infections and especially deaths. These results are consistent with research showing
that COVID-19 infections are more lethal among the elderly (Liu et al. 2020) and news reports
showing that a significant portion of COVID-19-related deaths in Canada occurred in long-term
care facilities for the elderly (MacCharles 2020).
We also show that collecting COVID-19 data at larger units of geography (e.g., health
regions) masks important heterogeneity within these areas, such as urban/rural differences in the

severity of the spread in COVID-19. It may also hide the impact of COVID-19 in industries that
employ large numbers of immigrant workers and that house them in group quarters, including
those in northeastern Alberta and north Saskatchewan which saw alarming COVID-19 outbreaks
in early May (Taylor, 2020). It is worth noting that our statistical models were able to identify
several communities which experienced outbreaks of COVID-19 infections. Our methodological
approach may offer researchers and public health officials a way to identify communities
vulnerable to COVID-19 ahead of time and take preventative measures to ensure that the
pandemic does not spread to these vulnerable communities even in the absence of granular data.
Finally, we show that our understanding of the severity of the spread of COVID-19
infections/deaths may differ depending on how we measure it (i.e., rates and counts). Currently,
the Canadian government and media focus on counts. Examining rates reveals several COVID
hotspots near border towns with the U.S., some of which are sparsely populated but have high
shares of residents infected with COVID-19. In focusing on counts, policymakers may be
missing these potential COVID-19 hotspots.
Our study has a few limitations. We rely on aggregate data about the socio-demographic
traits of communities to infer traits about individual residents. We recognize that this approach
could lead to ecological fallacies. However, only a subset of Canadian provinces has started to
collect data on individual COVID-19 patients and has plans to make this data available to
researchers. Even if these provinces release data as planned, Canadian researchers will have
access to official data on individual COVID-19 patients in late 2020 (Allen 2020). Many public
health researchers expect a second wave of COVID-19 in the fall of 2020. Insights about the
social determinants of COVID-19 are necessary to ensure that local governments take the
preventative steps necessary to reduce the impact of the second wave of COVID-19.

Furthermore, even if individual data become available, privacy laws in Canada may delay and
even prevent researchers from getting access to race data on individual COVID-19 patients. Our
approach indirectly fulfills both needs. Second, “health region” is the smallest geographic unit
for which COVID-19 data are consistently available across Canada. When we computed the
predicted infection/mortality rates, we assumed that the risk factors associated with COVID-19
infections/deaths do not vary across communities within health regions. It is, however, worth
noting that our approach identified several outbreak sites before it was the subject of media
reports; and as such, this approach may offer researchers and policymakers a way to identify
potential hotspots when confronted with data gaps about the spread of a pandemic at the local
level. Third, our reliance on public-use tabular census data precludes us from considering several
potentially vulnerable groups, such as temporary migrants and the age- and gender-specific
distributions of different populations. Finally, we rely on official counts of COVID-19 cases.
Borjas (2020) found that testing rates were lower among residents of minority and low-income
neighbourhoods in New York City. We may underestimate the severity of COVID-19 in such
communities in Canada.

SUPPLEMENTARY TEXT
We ran several models to test the robustness of our results. Results from
supplementary analyses are presented in the Appendix. First, in Canada, provinces have the
legal mandate to collect health data and administer healthcare for its residents.7 COVID-19
infection and death counts vary significantly across provinces, which may be partially the
product of provincial differences in COVID-19 responses. We wanted to include a series of
province fixed effects, but these models estimating COVID-19 mortality rates fail to
converge because disproportionately large numbers of COVID-19 deaths occurred in
Quebec. The inclusion of these province fixed effects alters our results for COVID-19
infections in two meaningful ways. First, the coefficients capturing the association between
the social, economic, and demographic profile of health regions and COVID-19 infection
rates are smaller once we add these covariates. Second, the association between the percent
foreign-born and COVID-19 infection rates is negative in the absence of controls for
provinces but is positive after we control for province. This is largely because economic
class immigrants are disproportionately present in the province of British Columbia, which
had lower COVID-19 infection rates. These results are available upon request.
Second, in the main text, we present results using standardized covariates to
examine the association between the social, demographic, and economic composition of
health regions and COVID-19 infection/mortality rates. These sample characteristics are
presented in Table S2. We also ran the analyses using the actual percentages. These results,
provided in Table S3, are substantively consistent with those presented in the main article.

Third, we tested the robustness of our conclusions by running the same models for
several stages of the pandemic: April 15 (i.e., roughly the peak) and June 15 (i.e., close to
the second phase of re-opening in several COVID-19 epicenters). Table S4 presents these
results. Our substantive conclusions are robust, regardless of the timeframe examined.
Fourth, Ontario and Quebec have been the two provinces in Canada with the most
COVID-19 cases. These provinces also have large black and immigrant populations. A
potential concern may be that the association between socio-demographic profiles and
COVID-19 infection/mortality rates in these two provinces are driving our results: COVID19 infection rates are higher in black and immigrant communities in these provinces, but
such an association does not exist elsewhere. To test this premise, ideally, we would have
liked to run our analyses for health regions outside of Ontario and Quebec. There are,
however, only 32 health regions outside of these provinces, rendering the sample too small
for us to obtain reliable estimates. Therefore, we ran robustness checks for the 52 health
regions in Ontario and Quebec. The coefficients for the association between the share of
black residents and COVID-19 infection and mortality rates are smaller for these
supplementary analyses than they are for the analyses presented in the main text. The same
is also true for supplementary analyses examining the association between the share of
immigrants and COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. These findings suggest that (a) the
national results are not the 'watered down' version of the Ontario and Quebec results and (b)
such an association likely exists in Canadian provinces outside of Ontario and Quebec.
Table S5 presents the results for health regions in Ontario/Quebec and all other provinces.
Finally, we ran robustness checks with COVID-19 data for the 140 neighborhoods
in Toronto. Our main results are robust. The only exception is that percent in the

agricultural industry is positively correlated with COVID-19 infection rates. This
differential likely emerges because percent in the agricultural industry ceases to represent
urban/rural status for residents of the City of Toronto. These results are available upon
request. The overall implication is that the associational patterns also hold when we
examine how socio-demographic composition affects COVID-19 infection/mortality rates
at a more granular level.
