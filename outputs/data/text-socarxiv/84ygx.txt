Abstract
During the COVID-19 pandemic, confinement measures were adopted across the world to limit
the spread of the virus. In France, these measures were applied between March 17 and May 10. Using
high-quality population census data and focusing on co-residence structures on French territory, this
article analyses how co-residence patterns unevenly put different socio-demographic groups at risk of
being infected and dying from COVID-19. The research ambition is to quantify the possible impact
of co-residence structures heterogeneity on socioeconomic inequalities in mortality stemming from
within-household transmission of the virus. Using a simulation approach, the article highlights the
existence of theoretical pronounced inequalities of vulnerability to COVID-19 related to cohabitation
structures as well as a reversal of the social gradient of vulnerability when the age of the infected
person increases. Among young age categories, infection is simulated to lead to more deaths in the
less educated or foreign-born populations. Among the older ones, the inverse holds with infections
having a greater potential to provoke deaths through the transmission of the virus within households
headed by a highly educated or a native-born person. Demographic patterns such as the cohabitation
of multiple generations and the survival of both partners of a couple help to explain these results.
Even though inter-generational co-residence and large households are more common among the lower
educated and foreign born in general, the higher educated are more likely to still live with their
partner at higher ages.

Introduction
In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a global health crisis, affecting
more than 120 million people in 219 countries and claiming more than 2.7 million
lives in a year1 . Several international studies have already shown how COVID-19
unevenly affects different populations and social groups within countries. In

5

the United States, the over-exposure of African-Americans in particular has
been highlighted, pointing out that the health inequalities structuring American
society were exacerbated by the pandemic [van Dorn et al., 2020] [Yancy, 2020]
with prevalence rates three times higher for cases and six times higher for deaths
in predominantly black counties compared to white ones [Khunti et al., 2020].

10

In general, pre-existing social inequalities in health seem to favour health inequalities in the COVID-19 pandemic as has been shown in China [Chen et al., 2020],
Italy [Group et al., ] or in Great-Britain [ONS, 2020b]. Controlling for age, mortality rates in deprived areas of England were more than twice as high as those
in privileged areas [ONS, 2020a]. In France the number of deaths has increased

15

sharply with marked differences according to the country of birth of the deceased.
All causes taken together, deaths in March and April 2020 of people born abroad
increased by 48% compared to the same period in 2019, and by 22% for deaths of
people born in France [Papon and Robert-Bobée, 2020]. There is a large variety
of possible factors that could underlie these socioeconomic differences including
living conditions2 working conditions3 or pre-existing health inequalities4 . In this
article, we focus on the role that household composition could play in creating
socioeconomic differences in the risk of dying from COVID-19. By focusing on
household structure we follow earlier research that has shown how demographic

factors, such as age, are likely to be important determinants of variation in mortality due to COVID-19 across countries and geographical areas ([Dowd et al., 2020];
[Esteve et al., 2020b]; [Esteve et al., 2020a]; [Bajos et al., 2020]).

However, the role played by demographic factors is not limited to the age
30

of populations. Demographics can help shed light on the causes of variations
in fatality rates by addressing factors such as prevalence of chronic disease,
population density, economic disparities, sanitary conditions but also household size and composition [Nepomuceno et al., 2020]. Inhabitants of the same
dwelling indeed expose each other to the risk of within-household transmission

35

of the virus [Li et al., 2020] and in France, the first results of the EpiCoV survey5 suggested the crucial importance of familial transmission with a rate of
positive serological tests 6.1 times higher for individuals living with another
previously infected person compared to the positivity rate of people living alone
[Warszawski et al., 2020]. The lockdown measures adopted in France between

40

March and May and again in November and December, designed to limit social
interactions and reduce the virus’ reproduction rate give an even more central
role to co-residency structures in the evolution of mortality inequalities in the
pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus6 .

45

By focusing on French data, our main goal is to investigate how co-residence
patterns can shape socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality in France
through the channel of within-household transmission. In this work, the inequalities analyzed are the inequalities related to education level, migration status

and citizenship status. The education, citizenship and nativity status are both
the benchmarks for many works on inequality and their study could help to

50

echo international work on COVID-19 social inequalities. The remainder of the
article is structured by first presenting a theoretical reflection on differences
in household composition across educational levels or nativity status groups
that may have an influence on mortality inequalities caused by within-household
transmission (1. Background). At the end of this section, we formulate a set of

55

hypotheses to be tested. The data and the method are presented in a second
part (2. Data and method), followed by the results of our micro-simulation
models (3. Results) and a final discussion.

1

Background

In this paper, we aim to study the impact that household arrangements can

60

have on group differences in mortality that can arise from the within-household
transmission of COVID-19, even though household arrangements can affect the
risk of dying from COVID-19 through other pathways such as the need for external
help and the need for contact with members external to the household. Given
this focus of the paper on mortality due to the within-household transmission of

65

the virus and the strong age-gradient in case fatality ratios [Verity et al., 2020]
two factors become important: the size of households -a limiting factor in the
potential number of people to whom the virus can be transmitted within the
household following an initial infection- and the age of household members.
The more household members, and the older they are, the higher the risk that
household members die after a person becomes infected with COVID-19. We label
this risk of household members to die from COVID-19 after within-household
transmission as vulnerability. We attribute to this vulnerability measure the
value of the average number of deaths that an initial infection could trigger
3

70

75

within an household through the transmission of the virus to the other household
members. In the next section, we discuss how three co-residence types that shape
household’s vulnerability are expected to vary by education and migration status:
individuals living alone, household size and multi-generational households.

1.1
80

Living alone at all ages

The possibility of within-household transmission of COVID-19 is determined
by a dichotomous feature of household composition: those made up of several
people and those made of people living alone and therefore not at risk of becoming infected by other household members. We here only consider how living
alone reduces within-household transmission of COVID-19. Unquestionably,

85

living with relatives provides advantages of mutual assistance or moral support
[Arpino et al., 2020] and individuals who live alone might be more at risk of
becoming infected by COVID-19 through non-household members but these
aspects are not central to the analysis presented.

90

An increasing number of people live alone in European countries and this
phenomenon affects all age groups to varying degrees [Esteve et al., 2020c]. The
age at which one leaves the parental home - which may be linked to economic
[Portela and Dezenaire, 2014] or cultural [Van de Velde, 2008] factors - matters
for the share of individuals living alone at young ages. After that, the like-

95

lihood of moving in with a partner and having children, then widowhood at
older ages, are the main successive causes explaining single-person households
([Reher and Requena, 2017]; [Requena et al., 2019]). In France, during the first
lockdown, 16% of the population lived alone, including a substantial number of
people over 75 years of age [Bernard et al., 2020]. Through the postponement of

100

household formation and the increase in life expectancy, living alone became more

4

common at all ages before retirement over the last decades [Bodier et al., 2015].
After retirement, the proportion of people living alone is much higher and
affects women more often, especially after 80 because women are on average
younger than their partners, live longer and re-couple less often after a break-up
[Francine et al., 2001].

105

These average age trends differ by socio-demographic characteristics. Before
the age of 45, education is positively correlated with the probability of living
alone. Whereas higher educated persons are more likely to live in a couple, lower
educated persons are more likely to live with children because of higher rates of

110

single parenthood. After the age of 60, these differences diminish and after the
age of 60 the level of education is associated with a lower probability of living
alone. This pattern stems from education-related health inequalities, which
reduces the risk of being widowed for higher educated individuals at higher ages
as compared to lower educated individuals [Blanpain, 2016].

115

Hypothesis 1a: Higher educated individuals have a reduced risk of dying
after the within-household transmission of COVID-19 because they are more
likely to currently live in a one-person household. However, this negative relationship between vulnerability and education can reverse with age.

120

Regarding immigration, a stronger link to migration is on average associated
with a lower probability of living alone. This might mirror the educational
gradient discussed above since immigrants and descendants of immigrants are
over-represented in the least educated categories. However inter-generational
cohabitation logic could also explain these figures if there is a higher prevalence
of multi-generational households in immigrant populations.

5

125

Hypothesis 1b: Since people with a migration history are less likely to live
130

alone, migration status should increase vulnerability to dying from COVID-19
after within-household transmission, regardless of the age of the person initially
infected.

1.2

Household size

The higher the number of people in a dwelling, the more potential for within135

household transmission of COVID-19. Several factors can lead to large families.
In France, the number of children is not evenly distributed by level of parental
education, with an over-representation of the least educated in large families
[Pirus, 2004]. Stepfamilies are also associated with a higher average number of
children and are more prevalent among the least educated [Bodier et al., 2015].

140

Immigrants are almost twice more likely to live at home with three or more
children than non-immigrants but descendants of immigrants live in almost the
same proportions as non-immigrants in households with three or more children
and have similar fertility behavior [Blanpain and Lincot, 2015].

145

Hypothesis 2: Household size is expected to increase the vulnerability of
the least educated populations and those with an immigration background, at
all ages.

1.3

Multi-generational households

Since the mortality rate of COVID-19 is highly age-dependent, household size
150

analysis should be accompanied by an analysis in terms of the age of its inhabitants. In particular, the heterogeneous patterns of inter-generational cohabitation
can cause high mortality differentials across social groups. Living with one’s

6

parents at different stages of the life cycle can impact inequalities in vulnerability
to COVID-19. Education is positively related to the age at first childbearing
[Davie, 2012]. At the same age, the children of parents with higher education

155

can therefore transmit the virus to older people within their households if they
still live in the parental home. However, living in the parental home happens
less often in more educated households. Among thirty-year-olds, lower educated
individuals live with their parents three times more often than university graduates. Even after a first departure, it is not uncommon to see people returning to

160

their parents’ home. The reasons put forward in the surveys to explain a return
to one’s parents’ home vary according to age, but across all age categories the
loss of employment, financial problems or health problems account for half of
the returns to the parents’ home7 . These problems predominantly affect individuals with precarious employment status and difficult working conditions, a

165

population in which the least qualified people and foreigners are over-represented.

Hypothesis 3: Education and the absence of links with migration reduce
vulnerability by lowering the likelihood of living in a multi-generational household.
170

All of these socially-influenced cohabitation patterns suggest that the inequalities in COVID-19 vulnerability linked to within-household transmission depend
on multiple factors that may have different directions and significance. Our aim
is to give a quantitative indication of the relative importance of these factors
in shaping the vulnerability of socioeconomic groups to dying from COVID-19
after within-household transmission of the virus.

Data and method

2.1

Data

The data used are from the Census of the French population carried out by the
180

National Institute of Statistics and Economic Administration (INSEE) from 2009
to 2013. Each year the census collects information on a subsample of all French
households. The French population is divided into five groups, with data on
each group being collected from a representative sample of household every five
years. The inclusion of five years of data therefore covers the whole French pop-

185

ulation. The final sample used in our analysis includes 19.6 million observations
representing 31% of the total French population living in private households.
Each observation is weighted in order to make the sample representative of the
total population in the median year of data collection (2011).
The only selection criteria we used to construct our sample was whether

190

individuals lived in private households. Inhabitants of collective dwellings
such as retirement houses were excluded from the sample by the statistical
institute providing the data. The data is organized into households and provides
information on age, education, citizenship, and migratory status for all individuals
in each household. None of the cases were excluded because of missing information

195

on one or more of these variables.

2.2

Measures

Decomposing direct and indirect risks
We aim to document group differences in the amount of deaths that are expected
to arise after a person becomes infected with COVID-19 and subsequently
200

exposes other household members to infection with the virus. In this case, deaths
can be of two types: direct deaths stemming from a "primary" infection when

8

an individual becomes infected outside of the household, and indirect deaths
caused by "secondary" infections, i.e. linked to to the transmission of the virus
from the primarily infected person to other household members. Following the
methodology of Esteve and colleagues [Esteve et al., 2020b], we compute for

205

each individual the expected total number of deaths if that person becomes
infected with COVID-19. We assume that primary infections occur at random
because we concentrate on variation that arises after transmission within the
household. Direct deaths per infection equal the age-specific probability of dying
once infected and indirect deaths are computed by multiplying the number of

210

co-residents the infected person has in each age category by both the age-specific
probability of within-household infection8 and the age-specific probability of
death following an infection. As the co-residential patterns differ throughout the
life cycle, individuals are classified into 10-year age groups.
Formally, we compute the average total number of deaths per infection in a
given age category as:

to give an upper-bound limit to the theoretical average vulnerability indexes. This assumption

social inequalities
Since the age-specific probabilities of dying ma are assumed invariant across
social variables but co-residence structures are expected to vary according to
the reference level of education or migration status12 , assessing the role of
within-household transmission on inequalities in COVID-19 vulnerability implies

230

averaging the second part of equation (2) not only by age but also by education
level or nativity status. Formally, we compute the average number of indirect
deaths following an infection in a given age category and a given sociodemographic
category as:

9 The probabilities of infection by age category are: 0-9: 40% ; 10-19: 38% ; 20-29: 79% ;
30-39: 86% ; 40-49: 80% ; 50-59: 82% ; 60-69: 88% ; 70-79: 74% ; 80 and more: 74%.
10 The age-specific infection fatality ratios estimated by Verity and al. [Verity et al., 2020]
were also used as a robustness check for our analysis. In the main model, the fatality rates used
are: 0-9: 0.000922% ; 10-19: 0.000958% ; 20-29: 0.0058% ; 30-39: 0.0163% ; 40-49: 0.065% ;
50-59: 0.24% ; 60-69: 1.23% ; 70-79: 4.29% ; 80 and more: 9.95%.
11 The data used to compute those rates are available at data.gouv.fr
12 Detailed figures on the heterogeneity of household structures across selected sociodemographic categories are available in the appendix.

10

Comparing different values of equation (3) for different categories s of the
same sociodemographic variable v identifies how the average differences in coresidence structures between social groups can shape the theoretical inequalities

240

of mortality related to the transmission of the virus within households.
Before moving to the main analysis we present the sociodemographic variables
we use to compare the vulnerability of social groups.

2.3

Head-of-household level variables

The objective is to study the dispersion of the vulnerability index as a function

245

of socio-economic variables, in particular education, citizenship and nativity
variables. However, not all inhabitants of the same dwelling belong to the same
education or migration category. We therefore assign socio-demographic variables
at the household level rather than at the individual level using information on
the reference person, which is identified in each household following the INSEE

250

methodology13 . The benefits of this household approach are especially clear
for individuals who have not completed their education and still live with their
parents. The head-of-household variables v from equation (3) we use to study
socioeconomic differences in vulnerability are education, "citizenship status"
and "nativity status". Educational level has been classified according to the
recommendations of the Conference of European Statisticians for the 2010
Population and Housing Censuses and contains 5 levels describing the level
of education completed: less than primary, primary, lower secondary, upper
13 The

reference person of the household is determined automatically using a rule based on
the number of persons in the household; If the household has only one person, this person is
the reference person; If the household has two persons: if they are in a couple and of different
sex, the man is the reference person; otherwise the reference person is the oldest active person,
or if neither of them is active, the oldest person; If the household has three or more persons,
the three oldest persons in the household are considered: if a couple is identified among them,
the oldest working man of this couple, failing this the oldest working man of this couple, failing
this the oldest working woman of this couple, failing this the oldest woman of this couple is
the reference person; otherwise the reference person is the oldest working person among them,
or if none of the three oldest persons in the household is active, the oldest person among them.

secondary or university completed. Education was preferred to occupational
260

categories because the later did not allow for the inclusion in the analysis of the
inactive (including students and retirees) or the unemployed recorded at the time
of the cross-sectional data collection. The nativity status distinguishes between
individuals born in France and foreign-born individuals whereas the citizenship
status is partitioned in three categories : citizen by birth, naturalized citizen
and non-citizen14 . Information on having parents who migrated to France was
not available in the data.

12

We start the analysis by describing the household composition of French households, and subsequently calculate connected vulnerability to dying from COVID-

270

19 and how this differs by education, citizenship and nativity status.
Figure 1 shows the average household composition by ten-year age groups.
The average number of co-residents ranges from 3.2 for young children to 0.6
for those over 80 years of age (Figure 1). Children are the populations with the
highest average number of co-residents. Between 20 and 29, individuals start

275

leaving the parental home, leading to a fall in the average number of co-residents.
Between the ages of 30 and 50, partnering and fertility behaviors increase the
average size of households. From the age of 50 onward, children leaving the
household coupled with increases in widowhood probability lead to a gradual fall
in the number of co-residents. Unlike other age groups, people over 70 essentially

280

live with individuals of their own generation.

3.2

Direct and indirect risks by age

Figure 2 translates the age-differences in household composition into risks of dying
from COVID-19. For each age group, the figure indicates the expected number of
deaths per 1000 random COVID-19 infections. This graph makes the distinction

285

between "direct" and "indirect" deaths according to the decomposition presented
in equation (2). The lighter part of the bars shows the age gradient of the fatality
case ratio computed with French epidemiological data and relates to "direct"
deaths i.e. the risk that primarily infected persons pass away themselves. The
darker part indicates additional deaths transmission of the virus to co-residents
could cause. These indirect deaths range from 1.2 deaths per 1000 random
infections in the 0-9 years old age category to 25.2 deaths for 1000 primary
infections among persons over 80 years of age and 21.4 for the same figure for
people between 70 and 79. In other words, the number of deaths that could arise

13

290

295

from a person above 70 transmitting the virus to other household members is
more than 17 times higher than the number of deaths that children aged 0-9
could cause in that manner. Below 60 years of age, this dispersion is lower.
Indirect deaths range from 1.7 deaths per 1000 random infections among 30-39
years old to 5.0 in 50-59 years old. This figure more than doubles to 10.4 indirect

300

deaths for 1000 primary infections among 60-69 years old. These differences
are related to the fact that individuals less regularly live with their parents at
age 30 and relatively more with children under 10. On the contrary, between
50 and 69, individuals live regularly with their partners since the widowhood
rate is relatively low in these age categories and can therefore transmit the virus

305

to a person from the same generation, whose age constitutes a non-negligible
COVID-19 mortality risk.

Figure 2: Vulnerability of households to COVID-19 related deaths by age
These figures highlight that the vulnerability of a population to the virus
14

not only depends on its age structure (direct deaths), but also on the number
and age of other household members to which each individual can transmit
the virus (indirect deaths). The significance of within-household transmission

310

on population vulnerability is essential at all ages. The younger the infected
individuals are, the greater the indirect deaths are as a proportion of all deaths.
Among people under 20, more than 99% of predicted deaths following a primary
infection are the deaths of another family member to whom the virus would be
transmitted. As age increases, the absolute predicted number of indirect deaths

315

per primary infection increases.
The next section focuses on documenting inequalities in theoretical indirect
deaths due to within-household transmission between social groups defined
by education category, country of birth and citizenship status of the head-ofhousehold15 .

education, the higher the number of indirect deaths following a primary infection.
Up to the age of 60, the educative gradient of our COVID-19 demographic

vulnerability index is very pronounced within each age group. The greatest
dispersion occurs between 30 and 39 years of age, for which persons living in a
household with the lowest level of education are estimated to cause 7.5 times
more deaths through within-household transmission following their own infection
than a person of the same age category in a household where the reference degree

340

is a university degree. As the age of the primarily infected person increases, the
education-related vulnerability inequalities shrink and between ages 60 and 69,
the head-of-household level of education no longer seems to play a major role.
However, after age 70 the direction of our educational gradient in mortality is
inverted with our average vulnerability index increasing as the head-of-household

education level raises. For instance, in households with a university degree as the

more deaths compared to the infection of an octogenarian living in an household
with the lowest reference education level. This difference is estimated to be
around 44% and to account for an additional 958 deaths per 100,000 primary
infections.

350

Using the birthplace variable, we observe the same shift as the age of primarily
infected persons increases (Figure 4). Following an infection, people living in
households headed by a foreign-born person can cause more indirect deaths
through within-household transmission up to the age of 60. The relative difference
peaks between 20 and 29 years of age. At that age foreign-born household
inhabitants are expected to cause on average 2.4 times more deaths through
within-household transmission following an infection. After 30, this ratio shrinks.

group and head-of-household citizenship status
From the age of 60 onward, not only does the total number of indirect deaths
360

by infection increase substantially, but inequalities in vulnerability are reversed.
The reference population16 suffers a comparative disadvantage and experiences a
higher average number of indirect deaths per infection. However, these differences
remain small and the reversal of our index gradient is less pronounced than with
the level of education and the reversal appears slightly earlier in the life cycle.

365

Estimated mortality differences amount to 60 additional indirect deaths per 100
000 primary infections among octogenarian and 133 among septuagenarians.
Regarding citizenship, the findings are quite similar even if the inversion of
the gradient is not that clear (Figure 5).
Our result that social inequalities in expected COVID-19 mortality related to

370

within-household transmission of the virus are neither of the same magnitude nor

18

the same direction depending on the age of the infected person is interesting and
analytically challenging. In the next section, we dive deeper into two questions
that emerge from the results:
• Why are the households of the higher educated and native-born less
vulnerable under the age of 60?

375

• Why is it that from the age of 60 onward, inequalities in vulnerability
to the virus following an infection seem to diminish and reverse across
groups?

3.4

Additional analysis

In the literature review, we discussed previous research to formulate expectations

380

about the prevalence of various household structures among different socioeconomic groups and how these could affect vulnerability to COVID-19. In this
regard, we discussed the amount of single-person households, household size,
and multi-generational households as factors that could cause differences in
vulnerability across social groups. Lower educated individuals and individuals

385

with a migration background/non-citizens were expected to live in households
that are more vulnerable to within-household transmission related COVID-19
deaths for various reasons. First of all, they were expected to live in larger
households. Table 1 shows the number of household members depending on
the educational level, nativity status and citizenship of the head of household.

390

Large households are indeed more prominent among the lower educated, the
foreign-born and non-citizens. Second, they were expected to more often live in
multi-generational households. Tables 7 to 9 and 10 to 12 in appendix C and
D confirm this expectation, lower educated individuals or individuals with a
migration background under the age of 50 living on average with older individuals
or with at least one person being one or two generations older. Finally, they were
19

395

expected to be less likely to live alone during the primary parenting ages. Table
2 shows the proportion of individuals living alone by age, education, nativity
status and citizenship variables. A positive educational gradient in living alone
400

is indeed observed at younger ages, particularly between ages 20-39. Similarly,
native-born and French citizens are more likely to live alone too.

Lecture Note: 12.6% of individuals living in a household in which the head of household
has an upper secondary education live alone. 4.3% of them live in households with more
than 6 inhabitants

These three factors combined provide explanations for why lower educated
individuals, the foreign-born and non-citizens are expected to be at a higher
risk of dying from COVID-19 after becoming infected by a household member.
405

However, these gradients in vulnerability reverse at later ages. For education,
the clearest explanation can be found in the number of persons living alone.
Table 2 shows that after age 60, the higher educated are less likely to live alone
than lower educated persons. To estimate to what extent these differences in
the likelihood of living in a single-person household can explain our results we

410

restrict the analysis to households of more than two persons in additional analysis
20

(Appendix Figures 15 to 17 and Tables 13 and 15). For the education variable,
the reversal of the gradient indeed disappears and the gaps beyond the age of 70
turn into a disadvantage for the least educated categories. A parametric model
estimated for households with more than two persons is consistent with these
results (Appendix G-Tables 16 and 17). These models also confirm for nativity

415

status and citizenship that differences in living in a single-person household
cannot explain why the gradient in vulnerability reverses at later ages.

Lecture Notes: 9.8% of individuals between 30 and 39 years old and living in a household
with a head of household being a naturalized citizen live alone. 45.3% of individuals over
80 years old living in a household with a foreign-born head of household live alone.

Additional analysis (Appendix C, D and E) shows that the main reason is
that even though older persons who are not born in France or not a citizen live in
larger households and are less likely to live alone, they live with fewer persons who
are at a high risk of dying from COVID-19. In other words, the age-composition
of these households is different. Whereas native-born and citizens predominantly
live with their partner or alone at later ages, the foreign-born and non-citizens
less often live with a person from their own generation i.e. their partner17 .
17 This analysis of co-housing with a partner at older ages is supported by a focus on the
number of couples in households by socioeconomic category. The results are available in
Appendix G.

Robustness and sensitivity tests
Our results are consistent with detailed demographic explanations. However,
our microsimulation model relies on assumptions that may shape our results.
Indeed, our modeling first assumes heterogeneity in the probability of being
infected with the virus as a function of age. This assumption and the probabilities

430

of infection incorporated into the model are based on the work of Davies and
colleagues [Davies et al., 2020]. Setting the probability of transmission to the
other inhabitants of the dwelling to 1 for all individuals allows to give an
upper-bound limit of the number of deaths that could result from an infection
and to check the sensitivity of our results to this age-specific infection rate

435

hypothesis. Figures 12 to 14 available in Appendix F.2 synthesize the results
of these models and show that our results -and in particular the reversal of
mortality inequalities with the age of primarily infected persons- are robust to
changes in the transmission rate.
In addition, the age-specific mortality rates are pivotal in shaping the results.

440

We made the methodological choice to apply to our model the mortality rates
computed with comprehensive French epidemiological data. However, the robustness of our results to a change in these mortality rates was tested by using the
age-specific mortality rates calculated by Verity et al. [Verity et al., 2020] and
used for example in the work of Esteve and colleagues ([Esteve et al., 2020b];

445

[Esteve et al., 2020a]). The results obtained with these new mortality rates
are available in Appendix F.3 and are also consistent with the model used in
the article. Only the inequalities observed between native and foreign-born for
primary infection at older ages are slightly smaller.
Finally, our model has been designed to separately address inequalities by

450

education, birthplace and citizenship status. We provide in the appendix the
details of a simple parametric model to control for the robustness of our results by

22

controlling jointly -rather than separately- for education and birthplace category.
This model also includes a set of additional other demographic variables and is
reproduced for different household sizes (Appendix F.4).

Discussion

455

The aim of this article was to investigate to what extent differences in coresidence structures could cause variation in deaths through the within-household
transmission of COVID-19 across social groups. Previous research has shown that
mortality related to COVID-19 is socially stratified. Among the possible reasons
that those from disadvantaged social groups are more likely to die from COVID-

460

19 are differences in co-residence structures. In this article, we investigated
to what extent this could be the case by relying on a simulation exercise. If
a random person becomes infected with COVID-19 how many individuals are
expected to die from the transmission of the virus to this person’s household
members? We found that education, citizenship and place of birth of the head

465

of household are all related to this expected number of deaths. The simulations
showed that the infection of lower educated individuals, of persons who were born
abroad and of non-citizens are indeed expected to lead to more deaths related to
within household transmission of the virus as compared the infection of higher
educated individuals, the native born and citizens. However, an interesting

470

element that came forward in the analysis is that these socioeconomic gradients
in vulnerability reverse with age. At higher ages, higher educated individuals,
the native born and citizens are more likely to still live with their partner.
Given that the partners of older individuals are at higher risk of dying after
infection with COVID-19, this increases the risk that someone dies after a higher
educated, native-born or citizen becomes infected with COVID-19. There are
important limitations that have to be taken into account when interpreting this
23

475

result. Firstly, the current work does not allow including the co-morbidity factors
between the different sociodemographic categories studied. It is possible that case
480

fatality ratios at higher ages differ by education due to comorbidity, a refinement
we could not take into account. Secondly, collective housing information was
not available either, an issue we have to leave for future research. Thirdly,
in addition to demographic data, the calibration of the model was enriched
with epidemiological data concerning the probability of virus transmission and

485

mortality by age group. The likelihood of transmission probably differs according
to other variables too. Future work could look at weighting the likelihood of
virus transmission by type of family, intimate or social link between each pair of
inhabitants within the same household. Fourthly, we did not take into account
possible differences by gender. Women might more often live with household

490

members (children/parents) and therewith live in more vulnerable households,
but at later ages, women might be more likely to live alone as they are more likely
to survive their partner. Future research can look into this further. Finally, it
has to be emphasized that our analysis relies on simulations based on estimated
case fatality ratios. The extent to which within-household transmission related

495

mortality varies across social groups in reality is a question that only future data
collections can answer. Nonetheless, our results do confirm the concerns that
socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals are more likely to live in households
vulnerable to COVID-19. However, this conclusion only holds under the age of 60.
At later ages, co-residence structures change and socioeconomically advantaged

500

individuals are more likely to live with persons at high risk of dying from COVID19. This could be taken into account when interpreting observed socioeconomic
gradients in mortality.

Conclusion

The role of cohabitation structures and their heterogeneity by age and social
group play an important role in the theoretical social inequalities in COVID-19

505

mortality. By measuring vulnerability inequalities as the theoretical differences
in deaths caused by the virus through within-household transmission following a
random initial infection, the results highlight that these inequalities are important
regardless of the age of person initially infected. However, the direction of the
differences in average indirect deaths per infection change with the age of the

510

initially infected person. The number of indirect deaths by infection is higher
in the least educated households or those with a migration background in the
youngest age categories. Then these figures balance out before turning to the
disadvantage of domestic-born or more educated populations for initial infections
of individuals over the age of 60 years. These results -underlining the fact

515

that cohabitation patterns alone can be a tenfold element of pronounced social
inequalities in mortality- find a strong resonance at a time when the return to
lockdown measures is re-investing public debate as the third wave of epidemics
appears in France. Also, by decomposing vulnerability inequalities on the basis
of two criteria -namely the age and socio-demographic category of the primarily

520

infected person- we posit that the social gradient in COVID-19 vulnerability
linked to within-household transmission is subject to finer logic than the social
gradient in mortality usually presented in the literature as its direction changes
with the age of the initially infected person. The same pattern is observed
for education level and place of birth, but a comparison of the age-specific
cohabitation logics of these two variables shows that the underlying logics are
different after the age of 60. For the level of education, single-person households
are the main factor in inequalities, whereas in the case of foreign-born individuals,
households composed of several generations and lower widowhood inequalities

25

525

530

with domestic-born persons reduce the observed inequalities.

conducted by restricting the sample in two different ways. First, by excluding
persons in the sample living alone in order to be able to quantify the importance
of single-households in the variations in indirect deaths observed between subpopulations. This test aims both to verify that the results observed are not
biased by people living alone, but also to provide elements for assessing the
explanations provided for the inequalities observed at different ages and the role
that living alone may play depending on the categorical variable studied (Figures
15 to 17). Results were replicated for fixed household sizes to provide additional
insights to our interpretations (Tables 13 to 15).

Econometric model

A parametric estimation model is used to control for the effect of a set of
variables on simulated indirect deaths following an infection. The model used
is an ordinary least squares model with categorical variables interaction terms.

645

The variable explained is the individual number of theoretical indirect deaths
from our micro-simulation models. This model seeks to test whether the effects
of education level and nativity status put forward in our analysis are robust to a
parametric estimation controlling for a set of other socio-demographic factors.
These variables are sex, region of residence, age, urban/rural character of the area

650

of residence. Beside these variables, the head-of-household education level and
nativity status are included, and the estimates associated to these variables are
used to compute their estimated effect on simulated indirect deaths. To compute
effects for both head-of-household education level and nativity status, three
models were carried out. The first one includes either the interaction between

655

age and education level or between age and nativity status, along the set of other
socio-demographic variables. The second model includes the same set of variables
and both interaction terms between age and head-of-household education level
and age and head-of-household nativity status to control simultaneously for both
of those variables. Formally, model 2 equation was:

yi

=

β0 + βXi + θagei ∗ HHeducationi + γagei ∗ HHbirthplacei + i

The third model replicates the second one on the sub-sample of households with
at least two persons. All coefficients are significant at a 1% level. All estimation
results are presented in the tables below in terms of differences in the number of
deaths per 100,000 infections compared to a reference level.
