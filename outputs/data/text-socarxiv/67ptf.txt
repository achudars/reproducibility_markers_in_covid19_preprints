ONLINE FREELANCING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
Abstract
This study combines market-level data about changes in jobs offered via online labor platforms
and interviews with online freelance workers to highlight how freelancers are responding to the
novel coronavirus’s presence. We pursue this work recognizing that as the scope and breadth of
the COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow, the implications to workers and labor markets are
profound. Our focus on online labor markets and workers reflects our enduring interest in
knowledge work, with a particular attention to precarious work. Market data show the dramatic
shifts in work availability (supply) and the changes in worker availability (demand) as the United
States’ economy struggles with the initial burst of effects of a pandemic. Interview data reveal
that freelance workers are aware of these shifts. These changes to already- precarious and
market-driven work arrangements are magnified by the realities of balancing family members’
changes in job status, working around children who are home from school, and re-organizing
work and lives to account for the rapid onset and confusion of stay-at-home requirements and the
uncertainty that is the core of the pandemic. Findings suggest work flexibility, which seems
central to freelancer’s motivation to pursue such work, is diminishing and instead freelancers are
being driven by desperation rooted in the acknowledged precarity of their situation, magnified by
the constellation of events reshaping their working arrangements. We further observe that these
effects vary by occupation and are more keenly experienced by women freelancers, both of
which warrant additional attention.

When Motivation Becomes Desperation: Online Freelancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic
Combining market-level data about changes in jobs offered via online work platforms
and interviews with freelance workers who use one online work platform, we focus on freelancer
workers’ initial responses to the novel coronavirus’s economic impacts in the United States. We
pursue this work recognizing that as the scope and breadth of the global COVID-19 pandemic
continues, the implications to workers and labor markets are profound. Conservative estimates of
a contained global outbreak expect significant global macroeconomic impacts (Atkeson, 2020;
McKibben & Fernando, 2020). Early research further highlights distinct demographic and
industry differences of the pandemic (Wenham et al., 2020; Stephany et al., 2020b).
We focus attention to online freelancers because of the precarity of their work
arrangements. Online freelancers and the online labor markets where they seek work are a
relatively recent subset of labor markets, seen by many as both a means to provide opportunities
for workers seeking flexible employment arrangements - short term ‘gigs’ - and for organizations
to help absorb market shocks (Kalleberg, 2003; Lehdonvirta et al., 2019). Freelance work is
project-based: there is little commitment between employer and worker beyond the specifics of
the project’s contract (Wood et al., 2019). The online nature of their work makes them
susceptible to greater competition by reducing barriers for other workers to enter and compete
(Dunn, 2017). And, in countries like the U.S., online freelancers are independent contractors.
This means they lack benefits like health care, retirement, leave, and other workplace protections
afforded to full-time workers (ILO, 2016; McKay et al., 2019).
There are at least three reasons the findings we report will interest readers of this journal.
First, online labor and the knowledge-and-expertise-based forms of such work that are embodied
in freelancing, like many forms of precarious work, are framed by issues of motivation for, and

4

ONLINE FREELANCING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
uncertainty about, flexible work arrangements. Second, findings suggest motivation does not
fully explain what these workers are doing. Third, findings also make clear that both gender and
occupation magnify precarity. As such, findings deserve the attention of psychologists of work,
of trauma, and those who focus on family relations.
The remainder of this research report is developed in four sections. First, we provide an
overview of online labor markets and the motivation for workers to pursue these gigs. The next
two sections contain insights drawn from market-level data about online freelance labor, and
insights drawn from an ongoing panel study of freelance workers in the United States. The final
section contains a discussion of these findings, followed by some contemporary conclusions.
Background
Focusing on freelance work secured online also means looking at online labor platforms
(and the online labor market), which is where freelancers find their work. Online labor platforms
are websites that mediate between buyers (clients) and sellers (workers) of remotely deliverable
cognitive work (Horton, 2010). Online labor platforms can be subdivided into freelancing
platforms (eg. Upwork), where payment is on an hourly or milestone basis, and microtask
platforms (eg. Amazon Mechanical Turk), where payment is on a piece rate basis (Lehdonvirta,
2018). Functionality provided by these platforms provides means to match clients and workers.
This includes allowing clients to post projects for bidding and allowing freelancers to post
resumes for clients to evaluate. Platforms also support the entire contractual engagement to
include time tracking, monitoring, billing, and dispute resolution. Online labor platforms are
sometimes called online gig platforms, but the work they support is distinct from Uber or
Deliveroo, which involve physical on-site service delivery (Wood et al., 2019).

ONLINE FREELANCING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
Pandemic’s Potential Effects on Online Labor Supply and Demand
With the COVID-19 pandemic impacting the world’s economies, leading to a massive
rise in unemployment in the United States, it is reasonable to expect impacts on the supply of
labor on online labor markets.1 One possibility is the number of workers offering services online
might increase because the pandemic and its countermeasures have led to record-high
unemployment in many countries, freeing up skilled workers (del Rio-Chanona et al., 2020).
Workers who were already offering hours online on top of their regular work (ie. moonlighting;
Pesole et al., 2018) might increase the hours offered as a result of being laid off. On the other
hand, the hours supplied online might decrease as a result of workers falling ill or having
increased care and housework duties, as schools close or household members fall ill.
The pandemic can also be expected to influence the demand for online labor. Many
companies in the U.S. use nonstandard workers as a flexible buffer that can be rapidly adjusted
in the face of economic changes, protecting core workers in downturns (Kalleberg, 2003). Public
policy responses to the pandemic have in many countries, and certainly in the U.S., led to an
economic downturn of historic proportions. It is conceivable that companies could be cutting
their use of online labor platforms to engage employees and longer-term contractors. Conversely,
there may be several mechanisms that trigger an increase in demand for online labor. Given this
surge of interest in remote work, it is conceivable that online labor markets are well-positioned to
accommodate new needs. Companies looking to engage new contractors might now favor remote
online contractors hired through web-based platforms. It is also possible that some companies

Supply generally consists of two elements: the number of workers offering their services through online platforms,
and the number of hours that they are willing to supply (Horton, 2010).

6

ONLINE FREELANCING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
might be moving existing contractor relationships to online labor platforms, in what is known as
the “bring your own freelancer” model (Corporaal & Lehdonvirta, 2017).
Depending how the online labor market responds to the COVID-19 pandemic,
diametrically opposed outcomes are possible (Stephany et al., 2020). On the one hand, the
number of jobs and opportunities could increase, leading to a higher earnings and greater job
security. Alternatively, the supply of workers could increase, leading to greater competition for
jobs, greater uncertainty for future prospects, and lower earnings. This suggests that one’s
motivation for completing gig work will likely determine how the individual workers are
experiencing the changes in the labor market. In turn, this motivation to pursue work likely
reflects these worker’s dependence on freelancing for their economic survival.
Motivations in Online Labor
Worker motivation has been the focus of sustained scholarly attention for decades (e.g.
Viteles, 1953; Vroom, 1964). Kanfer, Frese, and Johnson’s (2017) review of this attention makes
clear that motivation research generally falls into three categories driven by three distinct
questions: (1) Individual or content-based theories: What desires, wants, and needs elicit action?
(2) Environmental or context-based theories: What role do environmental factors play in
motivation? (3) Process or process-based theories: Through what psychological processes and
mechanisms do person and environment factors affect the direction, intensity, and persistence of
action? Content-based theories have focused on different types of motives including intrinsic
motives (e.g. Deci, 1975), justice (e.g. Scott et al., 2009), and traits (e.g. Barrick & Mount, 1991;
Barrick et al., 2002). Context-oriented theories have focused on the features associated with the
work environment (Meyer et al., 2010), including Hackman and Oldham’s job characteristics
model and related studies (Hackman & Oldham, 1975; 1976; Humphrey et al., 2007; Oerlemans

7

ONLINE FREELANCING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
& Baker, 2018). Process-oriented theories focus on the cognitive and affective mechanisms that
integrate inputs to form goals, plans, and intentions and regulate their abilities to accomplish
their goals (Tuckman, 1965; McGrath, 1984; Kanfer et al., 2017).
Beyond what is already known about worker motivation, there are at least three
additional challenges to consider when analyzing motivation in the face of an evolution of
traditional employment relationships toward platform-mediated work (Kanfer et al., 2017; Jagabi
et al., 2019). First, is the role of intrinsic motivation. For example, in their study of on-demand
workers, Rockmann and Ballinger (2017) found that, to the extent on-demand work fulfills one's
innate psychological needs, workers will develop intrinsic motivation. Furthermore, the
fulfillment of the worker’s psychological needs is an important driver of well-being at work
(e.g., Turner et al., 2002; Wheatley, 2017). Second, to what extent is motivation moderated or
mediated by control and agency? To this point, the central question is framed by worker agency
relative to bureaucratic control and management prerogatives (per Vidal, 2013).
A third challenge to understanding what motivates workers in online labor is the
autonomy and flexibility it affords (Malone, 2004; Horton, 2010; Gratton & Johns, 2013; Kuek
et al., 2015; Sundararajan, 2016; Wheatly, 2017). Early accounts highlighted how online gig
work provides “a flexible working schedule [that] allows individuals to take better care of their
families, continue to study, or start their own businesses while working and earning a salary”
(Kuek et al., 2015). Recent accounts are more critical (see Wood et al., 2019b).
Understanding flexibility in online freelance work builds from other technology-enabled
flexible working arrangements such as telework/telecommuting, flexitime, and flexplace, all
important topics of scholarship since the 1990s (see Baltes et al., 1999). These literatures have
identified potential advantages to flexible scheduling, such as reducing work-family conflict

8

ONLINE FREELANCING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
(Shockley & Allen, 2007) and allowing paid work to be combined with life circumstances that
prevent regular work (Silver & Coldschejder, 1994). However, studies of the effects of flexible
scheduling have often yielded ambiguous results (Baltes et al., 1999), calling into question what
exactly is meant by flexible scheduling (Shockley & Allen, 2007).
Relevant to the role of work flexibility to motivation, studies have begun to distinguish
worker-controlled flexible scheduling from manager-controlled flexible scheduling (Henly et al.,
2006). Many of the potential advantages of flexible scheduling are associated with workercontrolled flexibility, while manager-controlled flexibility is associated with the opposite effects,
because from the worker’s point of view it creates uncertainty and inhibits planning (Hyman et
al., 2005; Lambert et al., 2012). And, the boundary between worker- controlled and managercontrolled flexibility is ambiguous as the practices of negotiating working times can be bound up
in the power relations of the workplace (Lambert et al., 2012, Wood, 2016). For instance,
Wood’s (2016) supermarket workers were formally free to declare the hours that they were
available to work. In practice, however, they had to accept disruptive shifts or risk no longer
being offered work. Likewise, the freelance technical contractors studied by Barley and Kunda
(2006) were formally free to set their own working hours. Yet, many worked through evenings
and holidays because they believed that this would decrease their chances of being laid off and
increase the chances of future contracts (see also Fraser & Gold, 2001; Gold & Mustafa, 2013).
Thus, while the early literature on flexible scheduling framed this as a matter of freedom
from formal constraints such as mandatory working hours, more recent literature has emphasized
structural factors on workers’ ability to actually manage their time. Lehdonvirta’s (2018) study
of online gig workers concluded that a worker’s ability to schedule their work was ultimately
determined by two factors: how easily available the gigs were and how dependent the worker

9

ONLINE FREELANCING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
was on income from the gigs. If many gigs were available, then workers could schedule their
work relatively freely. But if gigs were scarce and the worker depended on income from the gigs,
the worker had to remain constantly on call, ready to sign up for gigs as soon as they became
available, before others took them (see also Wood et al., 2019b).
What all this work suggests can be summarized into three questions that guide our work
and this research report: (1) In the face of rapid online labor-market changes, are online freelance
workers even more motivated to pursue work? (2) How do the realities of online freelance
workers’ occupation, current work arrangements, and non-work obligations motivate their
decisions to pursue work? (3) What does flexibility, a central tenet to freelancers’ motivations,
look like during times of economic shock, like the COVID-19 pandemic?
Quantitative Evidence from the Online Labor Index
We first draw on Oxford’s Online Labor Index (OLI) for a macro-level assessment of
how online labor markets are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The OLI is an index that
measures the utilization of online labor platforms over time and across countries and occupations
(Kässi & Lehdonvirta, 2018; See Appendix for additional information on methodology). It serves
a similar function as conventional labor market statistics on new vacancies. For this report, we
examine the effects of the pandemic pertaining to the United States.
The OLI data provides a global perspective on online labor markets and helps make clear
that online labor demand is unevenly distributed with regard to geographies, as shown in Figure
1. In 2020, more than 40% of all global demand stems from the United States, while the second
largest single country buyer of online labor is the United Kingdom with eight percent. These data
suggest that the global online labor demand is shaped by the United States’ demand.

10

ONLINE FREELANCING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
Changes in Online Labor Demand
As data in Figure 2 make clear, over the past several years, U.S. online labor demand has
shown a clear seasonal pattern: demand drops during the year-end holiday season, and then rises
again to reach a plateau in March, which normally persists until June. However, this is not the
case for 2020. By mid-March, when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 was a
global pandemic, online labor demand in the U.S. was in steep decline relative to 2018 and 2019.
Then, in April 2020 demand began to rise again, surpassing the usual level of previous years at
comparable times. This suggests that U.S.’s online labor demand growth, after an initial drop,
reflects a response to the pandemic’s effects on job availability (that is, labor demand).
Insights on Occupations in the United States
The OLI data allow us to further dissect online labor market dynamics into six different
occupations: Clerical and data entry, professional services, software development and
technology, creative and multimedia, sales and marketing support, and writing and translation.
For a more detailed description of these categories, see Kässi and Lehdonvirta (2018). To align
the quantitative analyses with the subsequent insights from qualitative interviews, we simplify
the six OLI occupational categories into three groups: (1) Administrative work (“clerical and
data entry” and “professional services”), (2) Creative work (“creative and multimedia,” “sales
and marketing support,” and “writing and translation”) and (3) Technological work (“software
development and technology”). In addition, we are also able to observe the number of registered
worker profiles on a smaller set of online labor platforms. This can be used as an imperfect proxy
for the number of workers offering services through online labor platforms.
Figure 3 shows the change in demand and registered workers in the United States. As we
can see in the top panel, not all occupations experienced a drop in demand. Demand in creative
work shrunk significantly as the pandemic unfolded. But requests for technological work remain

11

ONLINE FREELANCING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
largely unaffected and even started to rise in April, 2020. This finding aligns with the idea that
the rapid push towards videoconferencing and other remote operations across companies has
created additional demand for freelance IT specialists. The initial insights are also consistent
with the idea that companies are cutting non-essential freelance contracts, such as marketing and
sales campaigns, while maintaining freelance work essential for continued business operations,
such as information technology support and services.
The lower panel of Figure 3 illuminates that the number of registered workers has
remained on pre-pandemic levels for administrative work and has shown significant increases in
workers registered for creative jobs (approximately 20% growth between April and June 2020).
In technology work, however, the number of registered workers has surged: there were about
60% more by the end of May than in pre-pandemic times.
Competition for Online Jobs
The ratios of registered workers per requested project for the three occupational groups in
the U.S. are presented in Figure 4. Pre-pandemic, the workers-to-projects ratios differ across
occupational groups. On average, at the beginning of the timespan, the ratio of workers to
projects is roughly three times higher in administrative work than in creative work and almost
four times higher than for technological jobs. This suggests that there is more competition for
administrative jobs, on average, than for technology work. This aligns with the experiences
expressed in the interviews of freelancers, as we discuss below.
During the first months of the pandemic this picture changes. Beginning in March, 2020
the ratio increases for all occupations. However, in contrast to administrative work, the increase
in creative work is much steeper. In both occupational domains, the upwards trend slows down
in May, with job competition in administrative work reaching pre-pandemic levels, while the

12

ONLINE FREELANCING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
worker-to-job-ratio in creative work remains higher than in February 2020. For technological
work, developments are quite different. The ratio starts to increase in early March but the upward
trend steadily continues until the end of the measured time span. By the end of May,
competition, measured by the ratio of workers to projects, has increased by about 50% as
compared to February 2020. Taken together, these findings indicate that job competition has
increased during the crisis for creative work and for technology jobs. The competition in
administrative work was less affected by the pandemic, and was relatively high before the crisis.
Insights from interviews and surveys with freelance workers in the US
Interview data come from an ongoing panel study of freelance workers located in the
United States and seeking work online via the online labor platform Upwork.2 Beginning in midMarch, 2020, we asked freelancers how they were faring in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.
For this paper, we draw on an interim analysis of 68 freelancers, 30 of whom spoke with us since
mid-March, reviewing interview transcripts, drawing on field notes, and looking to secondary
sources for additional insight and triangulation (See Table 1 for summary statistics, See
Appendix for additional information on methodology).3
Data from the panel study provide substantial evidence that suggest an overall decrease in
worker-controlled flexibility. The effects cut across both long-term freelancers and new
freelancers, and for both full-time and part-time freelancers. Freelancers indicated significantly
more competition, resulting in both a decrease in the number of proposals accepted and a marked
decrease in compensation, likely stemming from increased competition. A female freelancer

For secondary sources, we looked at active sub-threads for experiences with platform work, generally, and Upwork,
specifically, found in both the online platform Reddit and in relevant Facebook groups.

13

ONLINE FREELANCING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
reflects: “I think more people are trying to find online work because they’re out of their normal
jobs [...] I think there’s a lot less work to go around than usual because everyone is scrambling
to make money, either while they are at home because they can’t go into their office, or while
they’re laid off [...]So this current state definitely makes it more difficult” [FPAC040720201].
Some freelancers reported that the new jobs and tasks being posted also reflect lower
rates, leading to a sense that clients are taking advantage of workers during the pandemic: “[...]
there is going to be a lot of taking advantage of workers and their need to put food on the table”
[FPAC042620201]. Additionally, stable long-term clients who provided a dependable source of
income are stopping current projects and not requesting new work: “The two [clients] that I lost
due to this virus were long term. One of them I had been working with for approximately a year
and the other one was several months, but I don’t know what’s going to go on with them, if
they’re even going to come back or anything” [FPAC042520202].
The interview data aligns well with both the market-level data presented in Figures 3 and
4 and the survey data collected from freelancers as summarized in Table 2. These data show
decreases in weekly earnings between 12% to 47% for freelancers, and significantly greater
difficulty in securing work since the start of the pandemic. Our analysis provides evidence that
routines around freelance work have also changed. With spouses and partners being laid off or
having to work from home, and children also home due to prolonged day-care and school
closures, survey data shows that 40% of respondents are experiencing changes in their work
routines. More than a third of participants mention being responsible for caregiving during this
time. These changes are requiring the freelancers to alter their own working arrangements and
work availability as they have less time to pursue work. Overall, freelancers reported feeling less
productive and more “scattered” with some having to shuffle work around to nights and

14

ONLINE FREELANCING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
weekends with kids home: “The other thing that has affected me is that my kids are home now,
so I’m having to homeschool my two children on top of trying to stay productive and earn
income for myself, so I’m definitely feeling it” [FPAC04222020].
The data also show that earnings loss varies by occupation. Those doing administrative
work (admin) show the smallest decrease (-12%), followed by creative workers (-30%), then
technology workers (-47%). We asked before the pandemic and after the start of the pandemic
how difficult it was to find work in their respective fields. Respondents report significantly
greater difficulty in finding work as the pandemic unfolds, with technology workers seeing the
greatest differences and admin workers seeing the smallest differences. Furthermore, respondents
in the survey differed in the average number of jobs/proposals bid-on with admin bidding on
more than 80% more jobs on a weekly basis than those in technology. These findings align with
the data presented in Figures 3 and 4 showing greater numbers of workers registered per job
available, suggesting greater competition per job.
Data also shows the differences in the way workers from different occupational
categories engage with the work. Respondents in creative occupations, by a wide margin, had
greater dependency on the wages from gig work (it was their primary source of income).
Furthermore, while our data showed that the majority (~59%) of workers did not have health
benefits, 70% of the respondents in the creative occupations did not have health benefits. Given
that the economic shock that they are experiencing is driven by a virus-centered pandemic, the
magnitude of their precarity is evident and likely leading to a greater feeling of desperation.
Data also highlight the possible gender differences associated with these findings.
Research has shown that women are over-represented in the occupations associated with the
admin and creative categories in this study (Foone et al., 2018). Foone et al. (2018) also found

15

ONLINE FREELANCING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
that women across the entirety of the Upwork platform earned significantly less per hour than the
median man on Upwork, even when controlling for key variables such as work experience,
highest education level, and job category. In addition, Foone et al. (2018) found that women’s
lower hourly bill rates were coupled with a higher number of total hours worked on the platform.
Moreover, it is continually re-established that women bear a greater share of domestic
responsibilities (Barulescu & Bidwell, 2012; Blau & Kahn, 2016; Wiswall & Zafar, 2018).
During the current pandemic, these gendered differences in responsibility appear to be magnified
in households with children because of the continued closure of schools and the lockdowns.
Recent efforts to quantify the possible effects to households found that mothers are only able to
do one hour of uninterrupted work for every three hours done by fathers. Mothers are also taking
on more chores and spending more time with children in homes where there is both a working
mother and father (Institute for Fiscal Studies, 2020). Likewise, mothers are more likely than
fathers to have left paid work and experienced a larger reduction in their hours. Among those
doing paid work at home, mothers are more likely than fathers to be spending their work hours
simultaneously trying to care for children (Institute for Fiscal Studies, 2020). These findings are
amplified in single-parent families with female heads of households. Our data are consistent with
these findings.
Discussion and Conclusion
Our focus on online freelance work builds from an interest in the changing nature of
work and employment, with a specific focus on precarity. The COVID-19 pandemic’s impact
continues to unfold around the globe and challenges most societies’ ability to deal with the
overlapping issues of health, safety, and economic viability. The research reported here focuses

16

ONLINE FREELANCING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
attention to the impact of this pandemic’s disruption on the online labor market, specifically
situated in the United States, which comprises the largest share of online labor demand.
The Online Labor Index data show the demand for online freelancers has recovered to
pre-pandemic levels after a sharp dip, but all occupation categories are facing an increase in
labor supply. The data also show the pandemic’s effects impact occupational categories
differently, with competition - measured by the ratio of workers to projects - steadily increasing
for all occupations from March.
Results from interviews reinforce what is learned from the OLI data. Since the onset of
the pandemic in the U.S., Upwork freelancers have faced increased competition and uncertainty
about job security, as well as a decrease in compensation. These freelancers’ circumstances are
further complicated by the precarity that arises from the structural and legal nature of their work,
including not being eligible for unemployment and lacking access to employer-provided
healthcare. The precarity of freelance work is particularly pronounced among those in creative
occupations. Creative workers are particularly vulnerable as they report a greater dependency on
the wages from gig work and have the lowest reported access to health benefits. These workers
also report greater unpredictability of weekly earnings and experienced the largest drop in hours
spent across freelancing websites when comparing pre-COVID-19 data to post-COVID-19 data.
Panel study data suggests online freelance workers across all occupations are aware of
the decreased supply of jobs and increased competition. Surprisingly, the data show the number
of hours freelancers report working has decreased for all occupations since the start of the
pandemic. We surmise the decrease in hours may be explained by the realities of freelancers
having to re-balance their household lives. This includes accommodating the changing nature of
work arrangements, with spouses and children who are home from school now competing for

17

ONLINE FREELANCING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
time and space in the household. The effects of re-configured family arrangements vary by
occupation and have a greater effect for women freelancers’ motivation and ability to do work.
Building from this, we need to better understand the impacts of increased complexity and
changes to household life during a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among
women who are breadwinners.
Taken together, findings suggest that the concept of work flexibility, the primary
motivating factor for pursuing this type of work, might be better characterized as work
desperation. Motivated by flexibility, freelance workers pursue online work that fit with
household arrangements. Such work is always precarious, as our data show. But this precarity
seems a reasonable risk to preserve flexibility. Market shocks change the calculation in ways that
seem to overwhelm motivation, leading workers to eschew flexibility as they scramble for work,
even in the face of less flexible household arrangements and more demands.
As online freelancers continue to experience desperation amid increased work supply and
lowering wages, they will likely succumb to market forces and continue to bid for more work,
even when this strategy is not in their best interest. Desperation is increasingly visible among
freelance workers as the open market conditions of online labor markets are exacerbated amid
the COVID-19 pandemic. Attention to the roles of desperation, specifically with regards to the
interdependencies between work and non-work responsibilities, seems like a fertile and
discomforting research space for scholars of work.
Conclusion
Combining market-level and interview data, this research provides additional empirical
and nascent conceptual insights into some of the impacts of COVID-19 on the online labor
market and experiences of online freelancers. Data show that market shocks like that of COVID-

18

ONLINE FREELANCING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
19 lead to rapid changes in online labor markets and that these rapid changes reshape the ways in
which freelance workers seeking work online frame and pursue their work.
The premise of flexibility, a key motivating factor for pursuing online freelance work, is
challenged by these data. Findings show that flexibility for pursuing work is constrained by
changes in people’s household arrangements. And, the flexibility to select work that aligns with
one’s interests and schedules is challenged by the whipsaw changes in the competition for online
work as magnified by the increase in the number of people seeking work online (more supply).
We are particularly keen to offer these insights to scholars of work, seeking to draw their
expertise to better understand how the contemporary construction of worker motivation can
accommodate the structure of precarious work and the context of economic shock. On this last,
we see the COVID-19 pandemic as a powerful instance of economic shock. It may be a once-ina-lifetime economic shock, but it follows 12 years from the 2008 economic shock driven by
financial greed, and stands as the current marker for the next shock.
As noted above, online labor markets are what Kalleberg (2003) calls a buffer space for
companies to protect their full-time workers from economic shocks. Our data make clear what
many have noted: this makes these labor markets a very difficult place and way in which to make
one’s living. As work becomes more precarious, how do we translate or interpret the current and
extensive knowledge regarding the individual, environmental, and process-oriented mechanisms
driving worker behavior and engagement (per Kanfer, Frese and Johnson, 2017)?

Appendix
Quantitative Methodology
The index is constructed by continuously collecting data, in near real-time, on tasks and
projects posted on major online labor platforms. The OLI are published as an open data set and
an interactive online visualization, updated daily.4 The raw data (used in Figures 3 and 4) are
collected by periodically sampling workers from four major online labour platforms: Fiverr,
Freelancer, Guru, and PeoplePerHour.5
Qualitative Methodology
The study is designed around a carefully constructed sample of people who pursue
freelance work as a primary or secondary source of income, and reflect a range of work types,
skill levels, experience online, gender, race, and success with this work. Participants are hired
and paid as they would for any job found on Upwork.6 Once hired, participants complete a 15’
survey that provides us an overview of their working plans, outcomes and experiences, and a 45’
interview. The interview builds from the survey data and follows a carefully designed protocol of
semi-structured questions.7 We also did extensive analysis of the survey data collected from the
respondents. Specific to comparing with the OLI, the panel study design and this initial analysis,
relies on the job classifications provided by Upwork8, grouped into three broader categories, as
discussed earlier, administrative, technology, and creative work

6
To reduce the need for Upworkers to bid (as this costs them precious bidding resources), we invite them to the work.
Six of 10 do: acceptances and declinations are tracked. Research guidelines require paying those who agree to this job
even if they do not finish: this work is voluntary and they can cease working at any time. About one in 10 do not
finish. All who begin are rated five stars (as performance ratings matter greatly for online workers). Many of those
who have completed the work leave a positive review of the work. There are no negative reviews.

7

Interviews were done by one of the six members of the digital work research group, a joint effort of Syracuse
University and Skidmore College, both in New York. These team members were trained on the protocol and meet
frequently and routinely to review the protocol and pursue interim analyses (as is customary in field studies).
8

Upwork changes its categorization of workers from time to time, making classification an ongoing challenge.
