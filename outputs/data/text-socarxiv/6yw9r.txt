Abstract
We study how Swedish citizen updated their institutional and interpersonal trust as the corona
crisis evolved from an initial phase to an acute phase in the spring of 2020. The study is
based on a large web-survey panel with adult Swedes (n = 11,406) in which the same
individuals were asked the same set of questions at two different time points during the
coronavirus pandemic (t0 and t1). The sample was self-selected but diverse (a smaller
subsample, n = 1,464, was pre-stratified to be representative of the Swedish population on
key demographics). We find support for that the corona crisis led to higher levels of
institutional and interpersonal trust. We find no support for a polarization effect, according to
which low-trusting citizens responded more negatively to the deepening crisis than high
trusting citizens did.

1
A central issue during the coronavirus crisis is citizen trust in government institutions (van
der Meer & Zmerli, 2017) and in unknown others (interpersonal trust) (Uslaner, 2018). Trust
in government’s good intentions and capacity to act will foster willing compliance with
regulations to limit negative effects of the pandemic (Siegrist & Zingg, 2014; Taylor et al.,
2009). Correspondingly, trust in that fellow citizens will act responsibly improve the chances
of solving problems of collective action, such as hoarding of groceries (Lunn et al., 2020).

Countries entered the coronavirus crisis with a certain supply of institutional and
interpersonal trust (Ortiz-Ospina & Roser, 2020). That trust level, which varies substantially
across the world, formed a baseline condition for crisis management. However, as with other
supplies, citizen trust needs to be monitored and replenished during difficult times (Easton,
1975). To understand the social conditions to fight the coronavirus, we need to learn if and
how citizens update their trust attitudes in response to the dramatic events (Bauer, 2015;
Nicholls & Picou, 2013).

The present research investigate trust formation processes among the Swedish public as their
country moved from the initial phase of the crisis to the acute phase of the crisis. When
generalising findings to other national contexts, above all, we direct attention to two
parameters. First, the Swedish government strategy to curb the epidemic has (until April
2020) relied more on voluntary cooperation from citizens than on the mandatory regulations
imposed by most other governments (Paterlini, 2020). That is, the move from the initial phase
of the crisis to the acute phase of the crisis was less abrupt for Swedes than for citizens in
countries with a more extensive lockdown of society (Petherick et al. 2020).

2
Second, Sweden, like other Nordic countries, entered the crisis with uniquely high levels of
interpersonal trust, and with high levels of institutional trust (Martinsson & Andersson, 2019;
Ortiz-Ospina & Roser, 2020). In countries with lower supply of trust, identical policies might
have played out differently.

At the same time, Sweden has in recent years polarized along the lines observed in many
democracies with individuals to the right expressing lower levels of trust than individuals
who self-identify as centrist or leftist (Jylhä, Rydgren, & Strimling, 2019). In addition,
significant opinion leaders were calling on the government to introduce more stringent
containment measures (Franks & Nilsson, 2020; Robertson, 2020). This means that processes
of polarization between trusting and less trusting individuals can be meaningfully studied in
the Swedish national context.

We base our analysis on a large (n > 12,000) web-survey panel with adults Swedes in which
the same individuals were asked the same set of question twice, at the initial phase of the
crisis (t0), and at the acute phase of the crisis (t1). We also leverage that a subsample was
interviewed a year before the crisis, in December 2018 (t-1).

Using these data, we find that the Swedish public reacted positively to the dramatic events:
As the crisis went into its acute phase, Swedes’ trust in government institutions and in the
unknown other increased significantly; and there is no evidence in our data for a polarization
effect according to which low-trusting citizens responded more negatively to the deepening
crisis than high-trusting citizens did.

Theory1
In particularly difficult and dramatic times, such as after terrorist attacks and in wars, support
for government institutions often increases. These effects are known as rally-round-the-flag
effects, or rally effects for short, because they tend to increase support for figures or
institutions that are associated with the nation (Dinesen & Jæger, 2013; Hetherington &
Nelson, 2003; Mueller, 1970). Since the coronavirus carries war-like consequences, we
expect that it increases trust in government institutions in a similar fashion (hypothesis 1). In
support of this expectation, systematic research (Blais et al, 2020), as well as snap opinion
polls (Supplementary Information (SI), Table S11), have documented strong support for the
measures taken and for the authorities directly involved in crisis management, in several
countries around the globe.

At the same time, the rally effect should not be taken for granted (Amat et al., 2020). For
example, research on reactions to the swine flu epidemic (H1N1) in the Netherlands in 2009
shows a decrease in institutional trust at the peak of the crisis (van der Weerd et al., 2011).
More generally, people frequently find reason to blame their government for lack of
efficiency in the aftermath of natural disasters (Healy & Malhotra, 2009).

Moreover, expectations of uniformly positive reactions among the public are tempered by
conditional factors. It is often the case that people interpret government actions differently
depending on prior levels of institutional trust (Hetherington, 1998). In the current context,
low-trusters are motivated to identify negative aspects of ambiguous situations (Paek et al.,

(https://osf.io/bm2a6).

4
2008; Vaughan & Tinker, 2009). A related reason to withhold support is that individuals may
have strong preferences for stricter (or more lax) policies than the ones implemented. Given
all this, we expect to observe increasing polarization of institutional trust with people who
distrusted government institutions prior to the coronavirus crisis responding less positively
than pre-crisis high institutional trusters (hypothesis 3a).

Expectations about the direction of change, or indeed about change over stability, are less
certain when it comes to interpersonal trust. As interpersonal trust appears to be (partly)
driven by institutional trust (Rothstein & Eek, 2009; Sønderskov & Dinesen, 2016), we
expect that a rally effect will lead to increased trust in other people. Similarly, interpersonal
trust will increase if citizens generalize from mediated and personal experiences about
unselfish and solidary acts of other people during the crisis (Pavitt, 2018). However, to the
extent that citizens generalize their beliefs about other people on the basis of stories about
hoarding of supplies like toilet paper, we will rather observe declining trust in other people
(Fehr & Gächter, 2000). Moreover, according to some research, interpersonal trust is an
ingrained attitude that only changes gradually and under extreme circumstances (Uslaner,
2002).

Overall, since most countries have so far managed to keep together during the crisis, we
expect that the constructive forces are strongest (Mawson, 2005; Rubin, Potts, & Michie,
2010), meaning that the aggregate level of interpersonal trust will have increased during the
crisis (hypothesis 2). Given the commonly found information about people who behave
irresponsibly (Hopman, Allegranzi, & Mehtar, 2020), we also expect differential reactions to
the crisis depending on individuals’ pre-crisis level of interpersonal trust (hypothesis 3b).

Data and Methods
Our data is from The Swedish Citizen Panel, an online panel survey run by the Laboratory of
Opinion Research (LORE), at the University of Gothenburg.2 LORE has recruited a pool of
75,000 panelists, whereof 80% are recruited through non-probability processes. We invited
18,045 panelists to the first panel wave during the initial phase of the coronavirus crisis (t0).
Out of the invited, 12,881 choose to participate, yielding a gross participation rate of 71,4%.
In this baseline sample, males, elderly and highly educated are overrepresented in relation to
the general public (see SI, Table S5).

A sub-sample of respondents were recruited with higher priority to representativeness. The
sub-sample is part of a long-term panel that was recruited already in December 2018 to be
followed through future and at the time unknown social crises. The original sample (n =
4,056) was pre-stratified to be representative of the general public with regard to gender, age
and education. We invited the 2,499 respondents who took the first survey (t-1) to participate
in the currents study (t0), whereof 1,662 did (a gross participation rate of 66,5 percent). This
sample is used for robustness checks. (Table S5 in the SI provides sample characteristics).

The baseline sample of 12,881 panelists was invited to a second round of web-interviews
during the acute phase of the crisis (t1). Participation rate in t1 was high, 88.5% in the large,
full, sample (n = 11,406) and 88.1% in the smaller representative sub-sample (n = 1,464).
Vital for our purposes, panel attrition was largely non-systematic. Participants who scored
low on interpersonal trust in t0 were slightly more likely to drop out from the study, but
results are not driven by this bias.

While a probability-based sample would have been preferable in order to make exact
estimates of effect sizes, our panel data can be expected to reproduce the true underlying
change processes with reasonable certainty.

We run a priming experiment in the t1 survey (see SI Table S9). To avoid contamination
effects, respondents who were assigned to the treatment group (n = 3,869) are excluded from
our estimates of the effects of coronavirus experiences. The representative sub-sample was
not part of the experimental population.

Treatment
We want to learn how people updated their trust attitudes as the coronavirus crisis developed
from the initial phase to the acute phase. Expressed differently, the deepening of the crisis is
a treatment that may causally influence people’s trust in government institutions and in
unknown others. The treatment consists of the combined experiences that people made during
the acute phase of the crisis. We do not attempt to isolate effects of, for instance, government
policies, speeches by political leaders, the behaviour of citizens, news media coverage, social
media information flows, or, indeed, the number of deaths in COVID-19.

7
We date the start of the initial phase of the crisis in Sweden to February 2, when the
government classified the COVID-19 as a dangerous disease to society. We date the start of
the acute phase of the crisis to March 11, when the Public Health Authority (PHA) had
upgraded the spread of the epidemic to community transmission and the WHO assessed the
COVID-19 to have reached pandemic proportions. See SI for further documentation of events
during the two phases of the crisis.

The interviews for the first panel wave (t0) were conducted between February 24 and March
10, at the end of the initial phase. At the time, thus, participants were aware that something
unusual had happened, but they could not foresee the extent of the coming events. The
treatment heterogeneity that results from a small number of participants taking the survey
towards the end of the period makes no substantial difference to the results (se SI, Table S1-3
for the date of interviews).

The second panel wave (t1) was in the field well into the acute phase of the crisis, from
March 31 to April 14. While events continued to evolve from day to day during the field
period, all subjects had been heavily treated with crisis experience and there was no end in
sight.

Figure 1 shows the number of articles about the coronavirus in Sweden’s four largest daily
newspapers from January 1 to April 14 2020. It documents that the news media started to pay
attention to the coronavirus during February, and that news coverage increased dramatically
after March 10, when the Public Health Authority (PHA) announced that the coronavirus was
spreading in society.

Empirical Strategy
By looking at individual-level change, we can estimate the effect of the deepening of the
crisis on the two types of trust attitudes while controlling for inter-individual differences. Our
identification strategy hinges on that no other factor than the deepening coronavirus crisis
affected respondents trust attitudes at t1. Given the extreme character of the crisis, and given
that our t0 interviews were conducted close to the beginning of the acute phase of the crisis,
this is a reasonable assumption.

We examine change over time with paired t-tests since measurements are for the same
individuals over time. T-tests are complemented with fixed effects estimation with clustering

9
on individuals. Here, interview times (t-1, t0, t1) are dummy coded and included as
independent variables. Only individuals who gave valid answers to the trust questions are
included. All statistical tests are two-tailed.

Results
The coronavirus crisis increases levels of institutional trust (H1)
To measure institutional trust, we asked the following question: “Generally speaking, how
much trust do you have in Swedish government authorities?” Thus, we targeted overall trust
in government institutions, the kind of trust attitude that will be relevant in the long term,
post the coronavirus-pandemic (Norris, 2017). Responses were recorded on a fully labelled
five-point scale running from “very high” to “very low.” For ease of interpretation, we
recoded responses on the measures of trust to range from 0 to 1, with high numbers indicating
a more trusting attitude. See Table S4 in SI for details on question wordings, response
options, original values and recodes. Table S6 and S7 include further descriptive details on
the measures.

Before turning to the parametric test of our hypothesis that the coronavirus crisis increases
institutional trust, Figure 2 illustrates non-parametric smoothed local means and 95%
confidence intervals by interview date. This estimation method makes no assumptions about
the functional form during the time periods of interviewing. The figure suggests that there
was an increase in institutional trust between t0 and t1.

A paired t-test among the same individuals (n = 7,206) who answered the same question at t0
and t1 confirms that there indeed was a rise in institutional trust (mean difference = 0.098,
95% CI [0.094, 0.103], t7205 = 45.24, p < 0.0001, d = 0.53). The result (also depicted in Figure

10
3) yields support for the rally hypothesis on institutional trust. Effect size calculations rely on

confidence interval in grey. Bandwidth = 3, kernel function = Epanechnikov.

We document a comparable rally effect with the representative subsample, attesting to the
robustness of the shift. This sample was asked the same question on institutional trust at t-1
too. In the representative sample (n = 1,415), the mean increase in trust from t0 to t1 was
0.103 (95% CI [0.093, 0.113], t1414 = 20.86, p < 0.0001, d = 0.55). Moreover, the increase
during the time period of over a year from t-1 to t1 in the representative sample was 0.089
(95% CI [0.079, 0.099], t1414 = 17.25, p < 0.0001, d = 0.46). Taken together, this indicates

11
that the increase in institutional trust occurred across Sweden in around the month that the
coronavirus crisis reached its acute phase.

Note: Means of institutional trust at t-1, t0 and t1 with 95% confidence intervals. The estimates are based on
fixed effects regression with clustering on individuals. See Table S8 (model 1 and 2) in the Supplementary
Results for details.

A priming experiment embedded in the t1 panel wave failed to generate further support for a
causal interpretation of the observed change in institutional trust. Subjects who wrote down
their thoughts about the coronavirus situation immediately before they answered the question
on institutional trust were not more trusting than subjects in the control group, who instead
wrote about corona-related thoughts at the end of the survey. However, in retrospect, we find

12
it likely that all subjects were saturated with crisis experiences as they started to take the
survey (see Table S9 in SI about details of the experiment.)

The coronavirus crisis increases levels of interpersonal trust (H2)
Our measure of interpersonal trust was the following: “In your opinion, to what extent is it
generally possible to trust people?” We used a five-point response scale with designated
endpoints “people cannot generally be trusted” and “people can generally be trusted”.

The coronavirus crisis also seems to have increased trust in other people (Figure 4 and Figure
5). The mean difference among the same individuals (n = 7,184) who gave valid answers to
the question on interpersonal trust at both occasions is 0.012 (95% CI [0.008, 0.016], t7183 =
5.96, p < 0.0001, d = 0.07). The increase in interpersonal trust is substantially the same with
the representative sample in the short term (from t0 to t1; mean difference = 0.011, 95% CI
[0.002, 0.020], t1406 = 2.50, p = 0.012, d = 0.07) and long term (from t-1 to t1; mean
difference = 0.015, 95% CI [0.005, 0.024], t1406 = 2.90, p = 0.004, d = 0.08). Se

In absolute numbers, the shift might seem small, but it is important to put this shift in the
appropriate context. Compared to the increase in institutional trust, the change in
interpersonal trust is around a tenth. On the other hand, interpersonal trust is often seen as
very stable, almost like a personality trait (Uslaner, 2002). From this perspective, it is
remarkable that the crisis appears to change something akin to a personality feature.

material for additional details.

The coronavirus crisis increases the polarization of institutional and interpersonal trust
(H3a and H3b).
To examine potential polarization over time in institutional trust and interpersonal trust, the
dependent variables are created by studying change over time. Change scores are created by
subtracting the old value on trust (t0 or t-1) from the new value (t1). The effect of the
independent variable, the old value on trust, is estimated using OLS.

The change in institutional trust is not uniformly distributed. Most people increase their
support for government authorities, but this increase is more pronounced among individuals

15
with less trusting attitudes compared to individuals at the other end of the spectrum, as Figure
6 shows. At the intercept, i.e. where the trust at t0 is at its lowest point, the increase in trust
from t0 to t1 is 0.293 (s.e. = 0.007, t = 39.58, p < 0.0001). At higher levels of previous
institutional trust (t0), the increase is reduced (b = -0.305, s.e. = 0.010, t = -31.08, p <
0.0001). Given the coding of the variables, this means that there was, in effect, no change at
all among the most trusting individuals during the crisis. Of course, this may be an artefact of
the response options where the most trusting individuals could not select a higher value.

Fig. 6: Differential change in institutional trust during the crisis.

Note: The dependent variable is change in institutional trust from t0 to t1. The variable can range from -1
to 1, s.d. = 0.184, n = 7206. See SI Table S10 (models 1-3) for additional details.

16
The results depicted in Figure 7 show a similar pattern of change from t0 to t1 on
interpersonal trust. At the lowest level of trust, among individuals who say that people cannot
generally be trusted, the increase in trust is 0.199 (s.e. = 0.008, t = 25.36, p < 0.0001). Going
from the lowest level of trust to the highest, the change decreases (b = -0.254, s.e. = 0.010, t =
-26.69, p < 0.0001). The negative predicted value among the most trusting is presumably
measurement-related, where these individuals could not select a higher value at t1 compared
to t0.

Fig. 7: Differential change in interpersonal trust during the crisis.

Comment: The dependent variable is change in interpersonal trust from t0 to t1. The variable can range
from -1 to 1, s.d. = 0.173, n = 7184. See SI, Table S10 (models 4-6) for additional details.

Discussion
Here we demonstrate that the coronavirus crisis has led to higher level of institutional and
interpersonal trust among the Swedish public (hypothesis 1 and 2). This rally effect is
stronger for trust in government authorities than for interpersonal trust in unknown others,
but both types of trust have changed meaningfully as people have moved from the initial
phase of the crisis to the acute phase of the crisis. Contrary to our expectation (hypothesis 3a
and 3b), there is no evidence in our panel data that the Swedish public has polarized during
the process; if anything, individuals who were less trusting at the initial phase of the crisis
have responded more positively to events than the more trusting individuals have.

Rally effects with increasing public support for incumbent governments have been reported
in snap opinion polls in many countries (SI, Table S11) and in systematic research across 15
EU member states (Blais et al., 2020). In addition to mapping trust formation processes with
greater precision than in previous research, our study provides three new important insights:
(i) that the rally effect goes beyond politicians in power and government institutions that are
directly responsible for crisis management (we measure generalized trust in government
authorities); (ii) that the rally effect extends to interpersonal trust in unknown others; (iii) and
that the rally effect is homogenous across lines of division, at the initial phase of the crisis.

That the study was conducted in Sweden has specific meaning given that the Swedish
government has undertaken a unique “trust based” approach to crisis management (Paterlini,
2020). It shows that the public rally uniformly in support of an approach that rests upon
voluntary compliance with regulations rather than on compulsory lockdowns of society.
Moreover, it shows that public support can grow in the midst of a heated public debate about

18
crisis management, and even when substantial groups of citizens expressed distrust prior to
the crisis. It is good news for the fundamental legitimacy of the Swedish democratic regime.

We cannot determine with certainty how far results generalize to other national contexts. As
mentioned, the rally effect is found in countries around the globe. This suggests that three
months into the pandemic, citizens might rally round the incumbent government
independently of the choice of strategy for dealing with the coronavirus, and, possibly,
independently of the democratic status of the regime. The commonly observed rally effect
indicates that citizens typically have reacted to the coronavirus crisis as if it is an external
threat towards their community, much like when at war (Mueller, 1970) or when hit by a
terrorist attack (Dinesen & Jæger, 2013; Hetherington & Nelson, 2003). This is different
from when natural disasters hit countries, when citizens are prone to turn against their
government for failure to act effectively (Healy & Malhotra, 2009).

A possible causal mechanism leading to the rally effect is that in most countries political
elites have signalled that they stand united in the fight against the pandemic. According to
leading models for public opinion formation, consistent elite messages are expected to sway
public opinion in the direction of the message (Zaller, 1992).

Importantly, the reasoning above concerns trust in institutions, not interpersonal trust in
unknown others. In the absence of comparative information about citizen updates of
interpersonal trust, we do not know whether the increasing support extend beyond incumbent
governments in other national contexts than Sweden. To map changes in interpersonal trust is
a matter of urgency for researchers and polling organizations as the coronavirus crisis
evolves.

19

The study reported here is informative about public reactions during the first phases of the
crises. When our survey ended, in mid-April, the acute phase of crisis was still at its peak.
Since then countries have moderated the restrictions, and several have noted a stabilization or
decline, even, in infected and dead cases. In parallel, emerging signs indicate that the crisis is
evolving into an accountability phase, when strategies and measures are questioned and
criticized by opposing political blocs (Kuipers & t’Hart, 2014) and/or investigative media (de
Burgh, 2013; Kovach & Rosenstiel, 2014). This, in turn, will most probably counter the rally
effect. However, to date, it is a positive story about the possibility of dealing with the
consequences of the pandemic.
