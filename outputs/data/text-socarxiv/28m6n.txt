Abstract
Alongside the COVID-19 pandemic, the world has had to face a growing infodemic, which has caused
severe damage to economic and health systems and has often compromised the effectiveness of
infection containment regulations. Although this has spread mainly through social media, there are
numerous occasions in which the mass media have shared dangerous information, giving resonance
to statements without a scientific basis. For these reasons, infoveillance and infodemiology methods
are increasingly exploited to monitor online information traffic. However, these tools have also been
used to make epidemiological predictions. In particular, the ‚ÄúGoogle Trends‚Äù tool by GoogleTM has
often been adopted by the scientific community to carry out this type of analysis. In this regard, the
purpose of this paper is to estimate the impact of Italian mass media on users' web searches in order
to understand the role of the media in the infodemic and in the interest of Italian web users towards
COVID-19. In particular, our results suggest that the Italian mass media have played a decisive role
both in the spread of the infodemic and in addressing netizens' web interest, favoring the adoption of
terms unsuitable for identifying the novel coronavirus (COVID- 19 disease). Therefore, we suggest
greater caution and attention by the directors of news channels and newspapers and greater control of
the latter by government dissemination agencies.

1 Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has put a strain on economies and health systems around the world [1, 2].
As of March 21, 2020, the death toll is around 2.71 million and the trend continues to grow [3].
However, in addition to the disease, the world has had to face a growing infodemic capable of causing
damage of equal severity [4]. The role of social media (e.g. Facebook, Instagram and Twitter) and
even traditional media (e.g. national newscasts and newspapers) in the spread of infodemic
information has now been consolidated by a large literature [5-10]. Furthermore, there is strong
evidence that these two communication sectors are not separate: in fact, mass media have been able
to heavily influence the trends of users' web searches [10-12]. In such a vast and complex scenario, a
quantitative estimate of this phenomenon is difficult to achieve as includes a wide range of factors.
Nonetheless, the online behavior of users has often been monitored not only for mere infoveillance
but also to make predictions at the epidemiological level, assess the psychological state and risk
perception of web users or particular requests for medical assistance, and carry out analyzes of
environmental sustainability [13-18]. Therefore, given this international crisis, the need for a deep
understanding of the web media-user relationship is imperative. In this paper, we analyze the
influence of the main Italian media on web users looking for causal correlations, cross-correlations,
and relationships between the variables. Specifically, we investigate three aspects: i) the adoption of
the most appropriate terms for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 and related COVID-19 by media
and web users, assigning each term a specific value on the infodemic scale (I-scale, [10]), ii) any
causal correlations and cross-correlations between article titles of the two most read newspapers in
Italy ‚ÄúLa Repubblica‚Äù and ‚ÄúIl Corriere della Sera‚Äù and web searches on Google, and iii) the
contribution of Italian media in the spread of fake news. Data relating to media were collected on
their official websites and YouTube channels, while web users‚Äô interest was evaluated through the
infoveillance tool ‚ÄúGoogle Trends‚Äù by Google [19]. As highlighted by Cervellin et al. [20], Google
Trends is heavily subjected to the media, which is why it is essential, during this international crisis,
to dissect this relationship. Therefore, this paper aims to answer the following research questions: R1)
how much have the Italian media influenced Italian web users in the adoption of terms to identify the
novel coronavirus (COVID-19)? R2) how much have the Italian media influenced the web interest in
the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)? R3) What was the role of the Italian mass media in the COVID19 infodemic? R4) Is Google Trends a reliable tool for epidemiological analysis based on symptomrelated web searches or does it reflect media interest in the topic?

A substantial difference in the adoption of scientific names ‚Äú2019-nCoV‚Äù and ‚Äúnovel coronavirus‚Äù
against the more infodemic ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù was found at the beginning of the pandemic between the
most read newspapers ‚ÄúLa Repubblica‚Äù, ‚ÄúIl Corriere della Sera‚Äù, and others including ‚ÄúIl Sole 24

Table 1. Rate of adoption of COVID-19-related terms at the start of the pandemic (Jan 1 - Feb 13, 2020). *This item also
includes ‚ÄúIl Sole 24 Ore‚Äù, ‚ÄúIl Fatto Quotidiano‚Äù, ‚ÄúIl Giornale‚Äù, and ‚ÄúLa Stampa‚Äù.

Moreover, the streaming video portals ‚ÄúRaiPlay‚Äù and ‚ÄúMediasetPlay‚Äù by RAI and Mediaset (the main
Italian television broadcasters) did not show any results for the item ‚Äú2019-ncov‚Äù while produced
several results for the queries ‚ÄúChinese virus‚Äù and ‚ÄúChinese coronavirus‚Äù. These websites have also
special sections entitled ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù [21, 22]. According to Google results, from 1 January to 13
February 2020, the same websites used the term ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù in 93.8% of article titles against 6.3%
of ‚Äú2019-ncov‚Äù and 0.0% ‚Äúof novel coronavirus‚Äù. In this context, the Italian web users immediately
preferred the term ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù (ùëÖùëÜùëâùëéùë£ = 14) despite all the others (‚àÄùëÖùëÜùëâ < 1), showing values
comparable to those of the most relevant newspapers and television broadcasters in Italy. Moreover,
‚ÄúChinese virus‚Äù and ‚ÄúChinese coronavirus‚Äù were the second most used queries during this phase
(ùëÖùëÜùëâùëéùë£ = 22 ùë£ùë† ‚àÄùëÖùëÜùëâùëéùë£ ‚â§ 1 excluding the query ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù), showing further similarities with
the Italian media. Considering the keyword ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù, the weekly-cumulative RSV showed a
pronounced correlation with its weekly-cumulative use by the newspaper ‚ÄúLa Repubblica‚Äù (Figure 1,
next page).

Figure 1. Comparison between weekly RSVs of the keywords ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù (yellow) and ‚Äúcovid‚Äù (green) with the
number of times the latter have been adopted by the newspaper ‚ÄúLa Repubblica‚Äù (blue and red, resp.) from January 1 to
September 6, 2020. All values were normalized to 100. RSV = Google Trends relative search volume, t.d.i = titles daily
increase.

In the period from the week ‚ÄúJanuary 13-19‚Äù to that of the peak ‚ÄúMarch 9-15‚Äù, the average percentage
discrepancy between all data pairs was significantly smaller than in the following months up to
August (‚àÜ1,ùëéùë£ % = 68 ¬± 6, ùõ•2,ùëéùë£ = 115 ¬± 11, ùë° = 3.8). By restricting the analysis to the period 12
January ‚Äì 12 March 2020 so as to use daily cumulative values, 5 trends with significantly correlates
were observed (Figure 2): ùëü1 = .95, ùëÉ1 < .001; ùëü2 = .78, ùëÉ2 < .001; ùëÖ3 = .93, ùëÉ3 = .008; ùëÖ4 =
.94, ùëÉ4 < .001; ùëÖ5 = .94, ùëÉ5 < .001. From 12 March onwards, a single decreasing trend with a
significant correlation was observed until the week of 2-8 August (ùëü6 = .97, ùëÉ6 < .001).

Figure 2. Comparison between daily RSVs (red) of the keywords ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù and ‚Äúcovid‚Äù with the number of times
the latter have been adopted by the newspaper ‚ÄúLa Repubblica‚Äù (blue) from January 12 to March 12, 2020. All values
were normalized to 100. The black lines represent the beginning or the end of a trend. RSV = Google Trends relative
search volume, t.d.i = titles daily increase.

As for ‚ÄúIl Corriere della Sera‚Äù, the results were slightly different: first, the percentage discrepancies
between ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù RSV and t.d.i. were statistically confident (‚àÜ1,ùëéùë£ % = 99 ¬± 13, ùõ•2,ùëéùë£ = 92 ¬±
9, ùë° = 0.5); second, one correlation among the six investigated was weak (ùëü1 = .61, ùëÉ1 = .037; ùëü2 =
.56, ùëÉ2 = .013; ùëÖ3 = .91, ùëÉ3 = .012; ùëÖ4 = .24, ùëÉ4 = .604; ùëÖ5 = .57, ùëÉ5 = .067, ùëü6 = .96, ùëÉ6 <
.001).
Since the introduction of the scientific names ‚ÄúSARS-CoV-2‚Äù and ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Äù, the use of the
moderately infodemic and non or slightly infodemic names has partially changed compared to the
previous period (Table 2). However, even in this case, all the media are characterized by greater use
of the generic name ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù.

Table 2. Rate of adoption of COVID-19-related terms during the lockdown (Feb 11 - May 18, 2020).

In the period 11 February - 18 May 2020, the denominations ‚ÄúSARS-CoV-2‚Äù and ‚ÄúCOVID-related‚Äù
were used differently by Italian users (‚àÄùëÖùëÜùëâ < 1 ùë£ùë† ùëÖùëÜùëâùëéùë£ = 64, respectively). ‚ÄúCOVID-related‚Äù
terms were used less frequently than ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù until the second week of September (ùõ•ùëÖùëÜùëâ,ùëéùë£ % =
404, ùë° = 5.0). Until the second week of May, the weekly adoption of ‚ÄúCOVID-related‚Äù terms by ‚ÄúLa
Repubblica‚Äù was significantly lower than that of the term ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù (‚àÄ‚àÜi % ‚àà [642, 18]).
Furthermore, the percentage discrepancies between ‚ÄúCOVID-related‚Äù RSV and t.d.i. were substantial
(ùõ•ùëéùë£ % = 509 ¬± 32 in the whole investigated period). Nonetheless, correlations were found in the
period from the week 10-16 February to 23-29 March (ùëü1 = .99, ùëÉ1 < .001) and in the period from
the week 23-29 March to 20-26 July (ùëü2 = .64, ùëÉ2 = .007). Finally, among all the COVID-related
terms, ‚Äúcovid‚Äù was the one most exploited by users despite the more appropriate and specific ‚Äúcovid19‚Äù (ùëÖùëÜùëâùëéùë£ = 47 ùë£ùë† ùëÖùëÜùëâùëéùë£ = 2). The results for ‚ÄúIl Corriere della Sera‚Äù were similar (‚àÜùëÖùëÜùëâ,ùëéùë£ % =
773 ¬± 69, ùëÖ1 = .97, ùëÉ1 < .001; ùëÖ2 = .49, ùëÉ2 = .037).
Therefore, if a causal correlation of the type ‚Äúnewspaper titles ‚Üí RSV‚Äù did exist, three pieces of
evidence are highlighted: i) it caused a variation of the RSV highly similar to that of the titles of ‚ÄúLa
Repubblica‚Äù and ‚ÄúIl Corriere della Sera‚Äù before the peak, ii) it caused a variation of the RSV more
pronounced after the peak (for small variations of the independent variable, large variations of the
dependent variable were observed), iii) it substantially influenced the Italian web users in the adoption
of the terms used to identify SARS-CoV-2, generating a dangerous disparity between scientific and
more infodemic denominations.

Evidence supporting causation
Non-causal correlations could be due to a) stochastic phenomena, and b) other triggering phenomena
(spurious correlations). We found up to 6 significant consecutive trends (ùëÄùêæ ùëÉùëéùë£ = .007 ¬± .006,
‚àÄùëÉ < .04) and as many strong correlations. Suppose that the correlations found are due to chance
(hypothesis ‚Äúa‚Äù) and their probability of occurring is 50% (which is a large overestimate since it
would mean that, generating random data, the probability of obtaining a monotonous trend is the same
as getting heads by flipping a coin). The probability of obtaining such a scenario from chance is given
by (0.5)6 < .016. A more realistic estimate was obtained by generating random values using the
‚ÄúRandom Generator Number‚Äù provided by Dr. Haahr [23]: in particular, by generating 50 data series
composed of 6 numbers and looking for 1225 Pearson and Spearman correlations between them,
significant correlations (i.e. close to the threshold ùõº = .05) were obtained in about 6.5% of cases;
consequently, the probability of obtaining 6 consecutive significant correlations was (6.5/100)6 <
. 10‚àí6 . Furthermore, the hypothesis investigated was targeted thus avoiding the problem of the ‚Äúlookelsewhere‚Äù effect. Such targeting was based on data of this paper (e.g. the rate of adoption of COVID19-related terms) and previous works [11, 12, 10]. Hence, it is legitimate to consider these correlations
not due to chance. Now suppose that both RSVs and newspaper titles were causally influenced by a
third quantity x. Surely, this quantity must have been linked to the COVID-19 epidemic; ergo, we
started searching for correlations between RSV and COVID-19 cases (including deaths,
hospitalizations, etc.). Considering the time-lapse 20 February and 12 March 2020, we found three
distinct groups of correlations: ùëü ‚àà [. 97, .98], ùëÉ ‚àà [. 004, .005] in the period 20-24 February, ùëÖ ‚àà
[‚àí.83, ‚àí.91], ùëÉ ‚àà [.004, .02] in the period 24 February to 1 March, and ùëÖ ‚àà [. 86, .92], ‚àÄùëÉ < .001 in
the period 2-12 March. After that, although COVID-19 cases continued to rise until April, RSV

started declining as did the ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù newspaper titles. This allows us to preliminarily conclude
that web users have been more influenced by the media rather than by the trend of COVID-19 cases.
Nonetheless, linear regression and multiple regression analyzes were performed between the
quantities COVID-19 cases, newspaper titles, RSV following the scheme shown in Figure 3 (next
page). These results also suggest a greater influence of newspapers towards RSV, although there is a
marked dependence between all the variables. Furthermore, by improperly assuming independence
between the normalized variables COVID-19 cases (ùëã1) and Newspapers titles (ùëã2) and calculating
an LSM multiple regression plan for the RSV (ùë¶ÃÇ), we got ùë¶ÃÇ = 16ùëã1 + 1.7ùëã2 ‚àí 17 and ùë¶ÃÇ = 0.05ùëã1 +
ùëã2 ‚àí 15.

relative search volume.

Although it is glaring that, in some cases, both COVID-19 cases and newspapers have contributed to
conditioning Italian web users, COVID-19 cases had a more short-term and discontinuous effect than
newspaper titles. Anyway, it must be considered that even this kind of news is disseminated by
disclosure sources which can be I) official government sources (i.e. the Italian Ministry of Health and
the Higher Institute of Health), II) private websites, blogs, and social networks, or III) media. Thus,
let us start by assuming that all citizens, once they have become aware of the COVID-19 issue, have
consulted official sources (hypothesis ‚ÄúI‚Äù). Considering that these used, in the vast majority of cases,
the less infodemic names (83.5%), and the news they reported were few and not correlated with RSV
(e.g. the Ministry of Health produced 91 articles from 1 January to 12 March against tens of thousands
by media), we can exclude this hypothesis. Suppose then that the RSV was influenced by unofficial
sources not directly related to press and newscasts (hypothesis ‚ÄúII‚Äù). Since press and newscast have
their independent sources and we already excluded every random correlation as well a global
correlation with COVID-19 cases, we can only suppose a causal global process of the type ‚Äúmedia ‚Üí
private websites, blogs, social networks ‚Üí RSV‚Äù which confirms the fundamental role of media.
Therefore, the only hypothesis with empirical evidence is that media, such as press and newscasts,
have predominantly determined not only the web searches‚Äô trends but also the terms used to carry out
such searches (hypothesis ‚ÄúIII‚Äù).

COVID-19 symptoms-related web searches
As happened for the queries previously investigated, the keyword ‚Äúcoronavirus symptoms + covid
symptoms‚Äù in the timelapse January 20 - May 23 has been influenced by media (ùúåùëéùë£ = .92 ¬±
.03, ‚àÄùëÉ < .007). Its RSV was highly sensitive to news, reaching peaks of 74 ¬± 0.7, 86 ¬± 0.8, and
100 ¬± 0.1 on January 31, February 23, and March 9, respectively. Among the COVID-19 symptoms
reported by the Italian Ministry of Health, the ones that got the most web searches during the whole
pandemic were fever (ùëÖùëÜùëâ = 49 ¬± 4.6), cough (23.0 ¬± 3.5), cold (15.2 ¬± 2.2), sore throat (12.5 ¬±
1.3), and pneumonia (12.3 ¬± 3.2). During the previous 3 years (2017-2019), these showed winter
seasonalities but not global nor local trends or unit-roots (‚àÄùê¥ùê∑ùêπ ùëÉ < .004, ‚àÄùëö < 0.05,
supplementary figure 1). This allowed us to easily identify two anomalies: February-May 2020, with
‚àÜùëùùëíùëéùëò % ‚àà [50, 835], ùë° ‚àà [14,21], and August-November 2020, with ‚àÜùëùùëíùëéùëò % ‚àà [46, 264], ùë° ‚àà
[2.8, 6.2] (except for ‚Äúcough‚Äù). Therefore, the impact of the pandemic on this type of search has been
substantial. Nonetheless, there is evidence that counteracts the potential use of such web searches to
predict COVID-19 cases: in fact, the general RSV trend in the period February ‚Äì May 2020 presents
more similarities and correlations with newspaper titles than with COVID-19 cases (Figure 4).

Figure 4. Comparison between COVID-19 symptoms-related web queries (Google Trends relative search volumes) and
‚ÄúLa Repubblica‚Äù newspaper titles containing the word ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù from January to May 2020.

In particular, although the analysis of cross-correlations has identified some optimum values with a
lag of 2 days, the onset of local RSV trends never preceded that of newspaper headlines. Additionally,
we once again observed two clear decreasing trends in RSV between late February and early March
and after 15 March, despite the continued increase in COVID-19 cases.

COVID-19 web interest during the second wave
The ‚Äúcoronavirus + covid‚Äù query had a near-stationary RSV between early June and early August
(ùëÄùêæ ùëÉ = .135, ùëÜ = ‚àí0.09, ùëÜùê∑% = 8.3%). Understandably, because of the sharp decrease in
COVID-19 cases and the easing of containment measures, this was much less pronounced than during
the first wave (‚àÜ% = ‚àí71.4, ùë° = ‚àí14.2). From August 2020 to March 17, 2021, web interest in
COVID-19 remained significantly lower than that of the first lockdown (‚àÜ% = ‚àí57.8, ùë° = ‚àí4.2),
showing spikes of RSV at the start of the second wave (ùëÖùëÜùëâùëöùëéùë• ¬± 0.4, August 2020), a steep rise of
cases from 1 October 2020 until about mid-November (ùëÖùëÜùëâùëöùëéùë• = 35 ¬± 0.7), and mid-February,
anticipating the increase in cases at the end of February by about 10 days (ùëÖùëÜùëâùëöùëéùë• = 23 ¬± 0.5). The
use of the term ‚Äúcovid‚Äù has surpassed that of the more generic and infodemic ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù
(59% ùë£ùë† 41% from September 2020 to March 2021). On the contrary, the more technical ‚ÄúSARSCoV-2‚Äù has not been adopted by web users (‚àÄùëÖùëÜùëâ < 1). This time, we identified strong differences
in the adoption of COVID-19-related terms between newspapers and other sources such as ‚ÄúRai‚Äù and
‚ÄúMediaset‚Äù (Table 3).

Table 3. Rate of adoption of COVID-19-related terms during the lockdown (May 19, 2020 ‚Äì March 17, 2021).

Despite the use of COVID-related terms by newspapers exceeded that of the generic name
‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù in May 2020, the web users showed a delay of 4 months to do the same. Finally, web
users‚Äô interest in COVID-19 decreased by about 20% compared to the first wave.

2.2 Media influence on COVID-19 Infodemic
YouTube videos
The YouTube channels of the following news broadcasts were investigated (the number of
subscribers is shown in brackets): Rai (4.08 million), LA7 Attualit√† (730,000), MediasetPlay
(605,000), La Repubblica (576,000), Corriere della Sera (145,000), and Tgcom24 (52,700). Only
videos with over than 100,000 views were considered for analysis (the number of views is shown in
brackets). The views of videos containing the keyword ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù overwhelmed those containing
the keywords ‚ÄúCOVID-related‚Äù and ‚Äúsars-cov-2‚Äù (50.07 million vs 8.51 million, ùõø% = 141.9).
Moreover, some videos with the most views had extremely infodemic titles, including: ‚ÄúCovid does

not exist‚Äù (621,945, 1st on La7 Attualit√†), ‚ÄúThe 2015 Rai-Leonardo video on the virus created in
China in the laboratory. The scientific community...‚Äù (401,648, 4th on Il Corriere della Sera,
‚ÄúCoronavirus, Vittorio Sgarbi: "It is not an epidemic because there is no risk of death‚Äù (440,296, 2nd
on La7 Attualit√†), ‚ÄúCoronavirus, Sgarbi: The confinement of asymptomatic people is fascism‚Äù
(396,144, ), ‚ÄúCoronavirus, the conference of "deniers" in the Senate: The virus in Italy is no
more‚Äù(189,655, 47th on La Repubblica), ‚ÄúCovid, Prof. Roberto Bernabei: It's a normal disease...‚Äù
(141,233, 21th on La7 Attualit√†), ‚ÄúCoronavirus, the reassurance of the infectious disease specialist
Matteo Bassetti: It's not an infection...‚Äù (the video talks about similarities with the flu, 203,347, 14th
on La7 Attualit√†). Besides, we report the presence of growing interest in information channels that
discloses serious fake news, such as ByoBlu (524,000 subscribers). In particular, this channel often
shares scientifically unjustified opinions of people famous for their conspiratorial positions on
COVID-19. However, an exact estimate is difficult to make as many videos have been blacked out
by YouTube for disinformation [24].

Web searches
Some statements of prominent personalities, including scientists, have directed the web interest of
users towards disinformation and misinformation (Figure 5).

Figure 5. Infodemic query RSVs since the start of the pandemic. The "astrazeneca" query is not shown in order to allow
you to view the other RSV trends.

Among these, on February 23, 2020, Dr. Maria Rita Gismondo compared COVID-19 to a seasonal
flu [25]. On the same day, the RSV of the ‚Äúcoronavirus flu + covid flu‚Äù query went from 0 to 100,
maintaining high values until 22 March (ùëÖùëÜùëâùëéùë£ = 40.2 ¬± 3.2). On February 24, 2020, politician

Vittorio Sgarbi minimizes the risk of death from COVID-19 without any supporting scientific
evidence [26]. On the same day, the proper RSV of the ‚Äúcoronavirus sgarbi + covid sgarbi‚Äù query
went from 2 to 75. Moreover, Sgarbi became the protagonist of a long series of infodemic statements,
including the incitement to violate the anti-COVID-19 regulations [27]. Over the same period, the
RSV from the previous query remained high, hitting two new maxima on 10 and 14 March (ùëÉùëÜùëâùë† =
100, ùëÉùëÜùëâ = 93, respectively). Other major fake news circulated through the media involved the
creation of COVID-19 in a Chinese laboratory. The following contributed to this phenomenon: i) a
2015 report by a local news program, reproposed by the media, ii) the words of the politician Matteo
Salvini, and iii) the statements of the Nobel Prize winner Luc Montagnier [10, 28]. Another promoter
of conspiracy theories was Dr. Stefano Montanari [29]. Corresponding to his statements, there was a
spike in the RSV of the query ‚Äúmontanari coronavirus + montanari covid‚Äù. On May 31, 2020, Dr.
Zangrillo declared the disappearance of COVID-19 [30]. The same day, there was a heavy rise in the
query ‚Äúcoronavirus zangrillo + covid zangrillo‚Äù. However, the major infodemic impact by the media
has been towards vaccines, especially for the ‚ÄúAstraZeneca‚Äù vaccine. Figure 5 shows a clear trend in
the weekly RSV of the query ‚Äúvaccines side effects‚Äù from the second week of February 2021 onwards
(ùëÜùëÜ = 10, ùëÄùêæ ùëÉ = .009). By narrowing the range to get daily RSVs, a clear level shift can be
observed from 12 to 14 February 2021. In particular, comparing the periods January 20 - February
13 and February 17 - March 9, we observed a net percentage increase in web interest (‚àÜ% = 205.7%,
ùë° = 17.4). However, the peak is reached on March 11 (ùëÖùëÜùëâ = 100), with a sharp rise starting on
March 9. In the same period, a long series of totally misleading headlines were published by the main
Italian newspapers, fomenting the distrust of vaccines [31, 32]. Finally, comparing the same periods,
the RSV of the query ‚Äúastrazeneca side effects‚Äù has had an extreme increase ‚àÜ% = 2991.4%, ùë° =
16.9.

3 Discussion
The results of this paper suggest that the main Italian mass media have heavily influenced not only
the trend of web interest in COVID-19, but also the terms adopted by users to identify the virus. In
particular, there was a pronounced disparity between the use of scientific names and the more
infodemic ones: official sources, such as the Ministry of Health or international medical databases
such as PubMed, used non or little infodemic terms such as ‚Äú2019 n-cov‚Äù (I-scale = 0), ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Äù
(I-scale = 0), ‚ÄúCOVID‚Äù (I-scale = 1), ‚Äúnovel coronavirus‚Äù (I-scale = 1); on the contrary, in the early
stages of the pandemic the mass media used the term ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù (I-scale = 4) in about 90% of
cases, while from the second half of May 2020 onwards the ‚ÄúCOVID-related‚Äù names became the
most adopted in most cases. Exceptional cases are those of RAI and Mediaset, in which the term
‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù remained the most used. Alongside this, when SARS-CoV-2 was raging in China and
the first Italian cases arose, the Italian mass media often referred to the virus with extremely infodemic
terms such as ‚ÄúChinese coronavirus‚Äù (I-scale = 8) or ‚ÄúChinese virus‚Äù (I-scale = 9), while the query
‚Äú2019-ncov‚Äù did not produce any results in the RaiPlay and MediasetPlay search engines. In the same
period, strong phenomena of racism towards Chinese people in Italy were born [9]. The correlation
analysis showed that, during the early stages of the pandemic, the relative search volume trends of
the same keywords were essentially determined by that of the newspaper headlines on the same
topics. Furthermore, the web user responded with a delay of about 4 months to equalize the use of the
terms ‚ÄúCOVID-related‚Äù with that of the generic name ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù. Queries related to the symptoms
of the disease also had a trend comparable to that of the newspaper headlines on COVID-19. Even
concerning to mere infodemic, the role of the media was impacting: indeed, often giving a voice to
characters with no medical or epidemiological skills and doctors with conspiratorial positions
unjustified by scientific literature, they fed a climate of mistrust towards health authorities and antiCOVID-19 measures, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological. As proof of this, peaks in the
relative search volume of queries on the same topic and/or containing the name of the person
concerned were detected in conjunction with the aforementioned statements, interviews, and article
titles. Moreover, some among the most viewed videos on YouTube channels of the news broadcaster
had highly infodemic headlines. Specifically, the topics of greatest interest to the media and the public
were: i) creation of the virus in a Chinese laboratory, a thesis supported by prominent politicians such
as Matteo Salvini and even by the Nobel Prize winner Luc Montagnier, but with no scientific
evidence, ii) the minimization of the COVID-19 crisis, a hypothesis supported by the politician
Vittorio Sgarbi but also by Dr. Maria Rita Gismondo who compared the disease to seasonal flu
without any scientific evidence, and iii) the disappearance of COVID-19, a hypothesis supported by
Dr. Alberto Zangrillo without any scientific evidence. Finally, the ‚ÄúAstraZeneca‚Äù vaccine question
deserves a separate chapter. The European Medicines Agency authorized Astra Zeneca‚Äôs SARS-CoV2 vaccine for use in all adults aged over 18 on 29 January 2021 [36]. The first concerns about its
inoculation arose with the suspension in several European countries, including Italy, in early March
2021 [37]. Although it was specified that these suspensions were merely precautionary since due to
some reports of possible thromboembolic events, many Italian newspapers used unnecessarily
alarmist and terrifying headlines as reported by the website ‚ÄúBufale.net‚Äù (a private Italian factchecking portal against disinformation, hoaxes and alarmism that are rampant on the Internet) [31].
Thus, although the vaccine has now been re-approved by the European Medicine Agency [38],
queries about its possible side effects have an increasing trend as shown in Figure 5. Therefore, the
answers to questions R1, R2, R3 and R4 are respectively: R1) the Italian media have substantially

influenced the Italian web user in the adoption of terms used to identify the novel coronavirus
(COVID-19 disease), R2) the Italian media have substantially influenced the web interest of Italian
users in the novel coronavirus (COVID-19 disease), R3) the Italian media have contributed in a not
inconsiderable way to the spread of fake news and unjustified alarmism related to the novel
coronavirus (COVID-19 disease), and R4) Google Trends has shown great limitations as a predictive
tool of possible epidemiological situations as the web user has been strongly addressed by the mass
media also and even in the search for COVID-19 symptoms.
Limitations
This analysis was subject to some limitations. First, there are no guarantees that the interest of Italian
web users can well represent the interest of the entire Italian population, limiting the conclusions of
this paper to Italian Internet users. Furthermore, causal correlations were only searched between
Google Trends relative search volume and the titles used by the two main Italian newspapers. Future
research could investigate the correlations between the Italian population and the mass media, also
involving non-netizens and all Italian media. Finally, the paper cannot represent the entire totality of
the interests of web users that arose during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Conclusions
Since the main Italian mass media have strongly influenced the perception of risk and interest of
Italian web users towards the novel coronavirus (COVID-19 disease), we suggest that the Italian
authorities put strict and effective controls on the information circulating in Italy. Furthermore, the
authors of this paper invite the directors of the main Italian newspapers and newscasts to stick to the
scientific denominations of SARS-CoV-2 or any other future virus or disease, better pondering the
choice of article titles so as not to foment the infodemic. Finally, the authors of this paper recommend
carefully weighing the influence of mass media on users' web searches before adopting any
epidemiological predictive models based on Google Trends or similar infoveillance tools.

4 Methods
4.1 Design
To evaluate the impact of the media on Italian users‚Äô web interest, we compared the use of specific
keywords by the main Italian media with the relative search volume (RSV) of the same keywords on
Google Trends, looking for: i) significant and substantial correlations and cross-correlations between
RSVs and the article titles of the two most read newspapers, ii) triggering events, i.e. events that
triggered a trend (e.g. the beginning of a trend of the query ‚Äúthe covid does not exist‚Äù in conjunction
with related public statements reported by newspapers), and iii) similarities and differences in
keyword adoption rates.

4.2 Data collection
Given the heterogeneity of the data collected, different methods were used for each type of source
investigated. Specific keywords were searched in specific periods according to the following scheme:
-

January 1 ‚Äì February 13, 2020 (period 1): 2019-ncov, novel coronavirus, coronavirus, chinese
virus, chinese coronavirus.
February 11 ‚Äì May 18, 2020 (period 2): sars-cov-2, covid-related (i.e. covid, covid 19,
covid19, covid-19), novel coronavirus, coronavirus
May 19, 2020 ‚Äì March 17, 2021 (period 3): sars-cov-2, covid-related (i.e. covid, covid 19,
covid19, covid-19), novel coronavirus, coronavirus

Given the diversity of the search algorithms of the investigated platforms, different selection criteria
were adopted in order to make the results comparable.
-

PubMed: the results of each query were counted. Since the search engine provided
intersections in the results for the ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù (ùëÅ) and ‚Äúnovel coronavirus‚Äù (ùëõ) queries, the
ùëÅ ‚àí ùëõ calculation was performed to estimate the exact number of the former.

4.3 Statistical analysis
Linear regression
When data were normally distributed, the angular coefficient (ùëö) of the interpolating line was
calculated to evaluate the importance or absence of a trend. Moreover, Pearson (ùëÖ) and adjusted
Pearson (‚àó ùëÖ) coefficients were also calculated. Finally, the percentage of variability of the dependent
variable explained by the independent variable (ùëâ. ùê∏.) was calculated.
Mann-Kendall test
To highlight the presence of trends within a dataset, after an initial graphical analysis, the MannKendall test (ùëÄùêæ) was used. Furthermore, the importance of the trend was evaluated with the Sen's
slope (SS).
Mean values
The mean value of a data series ‚Äúùëã‚Äù was indicated with ‚Äúùë•ùëéùë£ ‚Äù. All average values were presented in
the form ‚Äúùë•ùëéùë£ ¬± ùëÜùê∏ùëÄ‚Äù, where ‚ÄúùëÜùê∏ùëÄ‚Äù indicates the standard error of the mean. These measurements
were used when the datasets were normally distributed or containing at least 30 elements [33]. The
variability of a dataset was evaluated through the percentage standard deviation (ùëÜùê∑%), calculated as
the ratio between the standard deviation and the mean value multiplied by 100.
Percentage increases
The percentage increases between two time-dependent values were calculated with the following
formula:

ùõ•% = [ùë•(ùë° + |ùõ•ùë°|) ‚àí ùë•(ùë°)]/ùë•(ùë°) ‚àô 100.
When the values did not depend on time, the following formula was used:
ùõ•% = (ùë•2 ‚àí ùë•1 )/min {ùë•1 , ùë•2 }.
Percentage differences
The percentage difference between two values was calculated with the formula:
ùõø% = 2|ùë•2 ‚àí ùë•1 |/(ùë•1 + ùë•2 ).
Pearson and Spearman correlations
When the datasets were normally distributed, Pearson's correlation (ùëÖ) was used; otherwise,
Spearman's (ùëü) was used. The correlation strength was assessed independently of the P-values. When
arithmetic averages containing both correlations were calculated, the notation ‚Äúùúåùëéùë£ ‚Äù was used.
P-values and significance threshold
P-values were used as a continuous measure of evidence against the null hypothesis [34]. However,
an indicative significance threshold of 5% (ùõº = .05) was set in all tests.
Shapiro-Wilk test
To evaluate the distributive normality of a dataset, the Shapiro-Wilk test combined with a graphical
analysis was used.
Welch's t-test
When the datasets were found to be normally distributed, Welch‚Äôs t-test (ùë°) was used. Furthermore,
when the size of the analyzed sets exceeded 30 elements, the central limit theorem was exploited to
use Welch‚Äôs test even with data not normally distributed [35]. Two values were judged to belong to
different distributions approximately when ùë° > 1.9.

4.4 Software
Microsoft Excel 2020 software was used for data analysis. In addition, RealStatistics
(https://www.real-statistics.com/) and XLSTAT (https://www.xlstat.com/en/) packages were used.
