Abstract
"Social distancing", a set of "nonpharmaceutical interventions" or NPIs in the
medical literature, is a primary defence, perhaps the primary defence, against
infectious disease, universally advocated by medical authorities in the US and
throughout the world during the current coronavirus pandemic. The idea is not
new. Perhaps the first government-directed quarantine system was mid-fourteenthcentury Venice's “quaranta giorni", forty days of mandated isolation for incoming
ships. We propose a 5-item primary scale of "social distancing" behavior (KEK-3)
and a slightly extended variant (KEK-3m), developed for use during the COVID-19
epidemic (and, potentially, beyond). The candidate items all had 7 answer
categories. Assessment aligns very well with the classical measurement model for
multi-item scales: interitem correlations are high; alpha reliability is 0.86;
correlations with criterion variables are similar across the candidate items; factor
analysis (oblimin rotation) finds a single dimension with an eigenvalue over 1 and
loadings around .7. We provide behavioral norms for America during the 2020
pandemic and describe KEK-3's links to demographic and socioeconomic factors.
Developing a replicable scale is especially important now, because many
researchers are making erroneous comparisons using the same terminology to
describe aspects of the epidemic which have been measured differently. To
successfully assess the "...meaning of social change related to COVID-19, the newly
emerging social practices due to lockdown measures..." (Esposito, Stark and
Squazzoni 2020), high-quality measurements sufficiently reliable and robust to be
replicated in different times as the epidemic evolves and in different settings are
desperately needed: KEK-3 contributes to such a set of measures. Data: four large
national sample surveys conducted April - July, 2020 during the coronavirus
pandemic. Data collection was through Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk. This scale
may be freely used by other researchers so long as its origin is acknowledged.

Introduction
"Social distancing", a set of "nonpharmaceutical interventions" or NPIs in the medical
literature (Greenstone and Nigam 2020), is a primary defence, perhaps the primary
defence, against infectious disease, universally advocated by medical authorities in the US
and throughout the world during the current coronavirus pandemic. The idea is not new.
Perhaps the first government-directed quarantine system originated in mid-fourteenthcentury Venice, the “quaranta giorni” or forty days of mandated isolation for incoming
ships (Chatterjee and Chauhan 2020).
In this paper we present a reliable, fully tested, multiple-item scale for measuring social
distancing behavior, together with behavioral norms for the USA during the 2020
2

pandemic, and a description of its links to demographic and socioeconomic factors.
Developing a scale that others can replicate is especially important in this epidemic,
because many researchers are making erroneous comparisons using the same terminology
to describe aspects of the epidemic which have been measured differently (Matthewman
and Huppatz 2020). In order to successfully assess the "...meaning of social change related
to COVID-19, the newly emerging social practices due to lockdown measures..." (Esposito,
Stark and Squazzoni 2020) high-quality measurements sufficiently reliable and robust to
be replicated in different times as the epidemic evolves and in different settings are
desperately needed (Jarynowski et al. 2020). We aim here to contribute to the development
of such a set of measures.
Data are from four large national sample surveys conducted between April and July, 2020
during the coronavirus pandemic. Data collection was through Amazon.com's Mechanical
Turk facility. A large majority of respondents took it on a computer with a normal sized
screen (so the full wording was visible all at once) rather than on a cell phone.

Item wording (Scale KEK-3 Distancing Behavior)
These questions were asked after several dozen other questions, mostly on the coronavirus
epidemic, so respondents were well primed on coronavirus issues (which we had referred
to mostly as the "new coronavirus", or the "Wuhan coronavirus", or "COVID-19" in earlier
questions). These questions were asked in internet surveys, so respondents saw the
question wording and all the answer categories simultaneously. The vast majority of
respondents were answering on a full-sized computer screen (laptop or desktop), not a
small cell phone screen, so both question wording and answer categories would have been
visible.
The questions together with frequencies choosing each answer (letter labels link to table
below and were not shown to respondents):
Some precautions help reduce the risk that YOU CATCH coronavirus. . .
a. One precaution is to stand at least 6 feet away from strangers in public. Of
course not everyone does that. But what about you, yourself – do YOU stand 6 feet
away?
34% Always
28% Almost every time
19% Most of the time
10% Half the time
7% Sometimes
2% Occasionally
1% Never
(Total 100%; N= 4,693)

b. Another precaution is not shaking hands when you meet someone (perhaps touching
elbows instead, or just saying hello). Do you avoid shaking hands?
53% Always
15% Almost every time
11% Most of the time
9% Half the time
6% Sometimes
3% Occasionally
2% Never
(Total 100%; N= 4,677)
c. How about washing your hands after you have been out in public?
54% Always
16% Almost every time
12% Most of the time
9% Half the time
7% Sometimes
3% Occasionally
1% Never
(Total 100%; N= 4,663)
d. How about avoiding parties, stores, and restaurants?
42% Always
19% Almost every time
16% Most of the time
9% Half the time
9% Sometimes
4% Occasionally
2% Never
(Total 100%; N= 4,671)
e. Avoiding going to other people's houses or having them come to your house?
42% Always
19% Almost every time
14% Most of the time
9% Half the time
9% Sometimes
5% Occasionally
3% Never
(Total 100%; N= 4,477)

closely related scale KEK-3m for reasons described in the text. If used it should
be the 4th question in the series.]
f. How about wearing a mask when you go to places where other people are -- do you
USUALLY wear a mask these days?
41% Always

13% Most of the time
8% Half the time

Measurement analysis
Classical measurement model
These items have good measurement properties, closely approximating the classical
measurement model (Bollen 1989, Treiman 2009) with high correlations among items in
the scale, very similar correlations with relevant criterion variables, and appropriately
high loading in factor analyses. The Alpha reliability is correspondingly high (.86).

* Job quality = occupational status, hghly reliable SIOM score ranging
from 0 to 100 (Kelley and Evans 2004).

The mean for our US national samples as of April through August 2020, in the midst of the
conroavirus pandemic, is 76.5 points out of 100 with a standard deviation of 21 (N=5,878).
So the US public claims to be social distancing at about three-quarters of the maximum.
The median is 83 points and the inter-quartile range 60 to 93. The 10 th percentile is 47
points and the 90th is 100. The distribution at the time this is being written in the midst of
the coronavirus pandemic is of course skewed heavily to the right, toward extensive
distancing:

As part of the same battery/module, we also asked about working from home (one
question), and self-quarantining (two questions). Self-quarantining formed the focus of
early simulations of Covid-19 spread, (Ferguson et al. 2020), although subsequent policy in
the US has emphasized "social distancing" practices, such as the items in our scale, which
allow people to venture outside their homes, but slow the spread of infection. Analysis
showed that the self-quarantining items raised several somewhat distinct issues, and so
did not fit the classical measurement model for combined unidimensional scale. They are
therefore not included.
Is wearing masks just one more element in social distancing?
The question on wearing a mask (the last question above) and similar questions on masks
asked elsewhere in the survey raise more difficult issues. (1) Conceptually the cloth masks
typically worn by the general public (unlike the N-95 masks often worn by medical
personnel in clinical settings) offer little or no protection to the wearer; instead they only
help protect others from being infected by the wearer. So the element of self-interest in
protecting oneself is not present for masks, unlike the other distancing measures which
clearly involve self-interest as well as altruism. (2) Masks have a fraught history in this
epidemic with many medical authorities advising against them early in the epidemic
(sometimes disingenuously, in the hope of preserving scarce supplies for medical
personnel) before shifting to urgently recommending for them later on – a mixed and
sometimes unpersuasive message. (3) The science about the protective role of the kind of
masks available to the general public was not entirely clear, especially early in the
epidemic. (4) Aside from their medical efficacy, masks may have taken on a symbolic role
signalling one's status as a pro-social being. Thus the role of masks as distancing behavior
is rather different than for the other behaviors we are asking about. Accordingly we
7

included 2 additional question about masks: Do you wear a mask when shopping and do
you wear a mask at work.
Empirically correlations between the masking question and other distancing items are
rather lower than the usual pattern (Table 1, Panel 1, row f) which argues against their
inclusion in the combined scale on the usual measurement model. The correlations with
criterion variables (Table 1, Panels 2, 3, 4, 5 and 5) are fairly similar, which argues for their
inclusion. But, the classic measurement model requires both high inter-item correlations
and similar correlations with other variables).
Factor analysis is ambiguous on the issue (Table 2). In our exploratory factor analysis, the
other items in the scale all have high factor loadings, around a (very satisfactory) .70 to .75.
The three mask items have loadings in the .50s, noticeably lower (although a cutoff as low
as .50 is accepted in some fields). This suggests the mask questions could be, but may not
be, part of the same measurement scale. But evidence against including them in the scale is
on the second factor: The loadings (around .35 to .56) on a second factor specific to the
mask questions are the anomalously high and sharply different from the other items
(Table 2, column 2).

Despite all these empirical, conceptual and historical uncertainties, masks are a significant
element in social distancing. They are also (as this is written in August) an element very
prominent in public and political discourse. So there is a good argument for including
them in a distancing scale, as well as good arguments for excluding them.
For simplicity we exclude them from the main scale (scale KEK-3). Our experience so far
with half a dozen analyses done both with the main scale and alternatively with a scale
including the one mask question (scale KEK-3m) is that the alternatives lead to virtually
identical conclusions. An example is shown below (Table 3, columns 1 and 2).

Focusing on masks alone (a three-item scale, Alpha reliability = .86) shows broadly the
same picture as the other distancing behaviors (Table 3, column 1 versus column 3).
But there are some differences, most notably that mask wearing seems to respond more
volatilely to other things – perhaps it is more expressive because it has no self-interest
component the way other distancing behaviors do. Democrats are even more distinctively
pro-mask than for other distancing behaviors; trust in medical authorities leads even more
clearly to mask wearing than to other distancing behaviors; and mask-wearing is even
more closely tied to a sense of efficacy.

Conclusion: Scale KEK-3 Distancing Behavior Scale
We show here that the KEK-3 Distancing Behavior Scale is a reliable, multiple-item scale
for measuring social distancing behavior, which has been stringently assessed according to
the rules for the classical measurement model. We also present its behavioral norms for
the USA during the 2020 pandemic.
