"18" "Abstract"
"19" "Background:  A COVID-19 vaccination for children is positioned to be a critical resource in the pandemic-prevention effort. However, studies have shown hesitation towards COVID-19 vaccination uptake and a lack of trust in government agencies; putting children at-risk for not receiving preventative medical care. The purpose of this study was to determine the association between trust in  public  health agencies and  parental  intention to vaccin ate their  children against COVID-19."
"20" "Methods:  Residents of a Midwestern state who reported being parent/guardian of one or more child, aged  < 18 living at home, were recruited to participate in a cross-sectional online survey conducted during September-October 2020 (n=238). Participants were asked their level of trust in both state and local  public  health departments and if they planned on vaccinating their child ren  against COVID-19.  R esident geography ,  rural, suburban,  and  urban ,  was  categorized using   definitions from the Health Resource Services Administration (HRSA)  and matched to participant  county of  residence.  D escriptive  and  binomial logistic regression  analyses were conducted to predict  probability  of vaccine intent for children."
"21" "Results: .  Among participants, 1 32  (5 5.5 %) reported intention to vaccinate their children against COVID-19.  Factors that were found to significantly decrease probability of vaccinating child were  being a rural resident  and  lower level of  trust in both state and local  public  health agencies."
"22" "Discussion:  Results from this study highlight the importance of addressing  public health  agency   mistrust  among individuals, regardless of geography, to assure more equitable vaccine delivery. Further, special focus may be needed for those living in more isolated, less populated areas, where  a higher  level of trust may be  needed  before parents vaccinate their children ."
"23" "Background"
"24" "In the early months of 2021, the deployment and administration of several  Federal Drug Administration  (FDA)  Emergency Use Approved (EUA)  COVID-19 vaccines  were made widely available  in the U.S. 1   D uring  the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S.  could  rel y  on ly on  nonpharmaceutical interventions to reduce SARS-COV-2 transmission and address the overwhelming burden experienced by healthcare systems. While these interventions, such as social distancing, shelter ing -in-place, and  mask  mandates  have  shown  to  be  effective strategies  against COVID-19 2-4 ,  their implementation across the U.S. ha d   varied  among cities, counties, and states,  to such an extent th ey   were   likely to have  a reduced  preven tative   impact 5,6 .  The U.S. experienced challenges to implementing a cohesive and  compresenive  response to COVID-19, which left the need for pharmaceutical prevention interventions most urgent 7 ."
"25" "While  the  initial availability of  COVID-19  vaccines  were  limited to populations at increased risk for more  exposure and/or  adverse COVID-19 outcomes, e.g.,  healthcare workers,  older adults and those living with other chronic diseases ;  federal guidelines to make the COVID-19 vaccines available to all populations  are  expected   for implementation by  mid-2021 . 8,9  However,  this expanded availability did not include children and young adolescents under the age of sixteen . A s  of mid-2021 , only one U.S. COVID-19 vaccine being  available  to those sixteen and older and  two  other  approved vaccines are  available  for those eighteen and older . 10"
"26" "The role young children have played in COVID-19 transmission is not well understood . 11  Early reports stated that children were less likely to transmit SARS-COV-2 due to the seemingly  lower   prevelance . 12  However, f urther research has shown viral load  capability  among children  equal to, if not higher, than adults and disproportionate prevalence may be due to presentation of symptoms, or lack-there-of, in younger populations . 13  P resentation of COVID-19 symptoms has been key in  enacting  prevention efforts, acting as a trigger  to quarantine   or   socially isolate . Yet, there are estimates of 50% of the COVID-19 cases being  asymptomatic with a n  ability to  effectively  transmit infection places children  a priority to better understand the spectrum of disease and the efficacy of vaccines among youth .  With a  childhood COVID-19 vaccine predicted to be available  for those aged younger than 16  by late 2021 or early 2022 ,  identifying possible barriers among parents to vaccinate their children is both timely and crucial 14 ."
"27" "Trust in  public  health systems remains a prominent barrier in vaccine intent . 15   Particularly,  mistrust  in health systems and public health agencies have served as barriers to   vaccine uptake.  16  A lack of trust in these organizations by parents is likely to place children at risk for not receiving preventative  care . While trust in health systems  is  established as a key factor in vaccine intent , the role of parental trust  in  public  health agencies associated  with a yet-to-be released vaccine during a pandemic   is not well understood . The aim of this study was to determine the association between parental trust in  local, state, and federal public  health agencies   and intent to vaccinate children against COVID-19.  P ublicly heightened awareness of pandemic era vaccine development, present a unique opportunity to better understand the established relationship between trust and vaccine intent."
"28" "Methods"
"29" "Saint Louis University, in association with the data management and  voter  market research organization YouGov , 17  administered a  cross-sectional  online survey to  a recruited pool of  1,063 Missouri residents  from September to October 2020. Among the tota l sampled,  238 reported being a parent/guardian to at least one child under the age  of 18.  Participants were sampled across the state of Missouri with an oversampling of racial and ethnic minorities. Cases were matched according to gender, age, race, and education, and weighted using propensity scores derived from the 2018 Current Population Study . 18  Participants were remunerated for time , informed consent was given prior to participation,  and questions and collection was approved by  the Saint Louis University Institutional Review B oard."
"30" "Participants were asked if they were likely to vaccinate their child  against COVID-19 ,  if such a vaccination was available , and given the response options of “ definitely ”, “ probably ”, “ probably   not ”,  or   “ definitely not ” .  Participant  responses  were dichotomized  for the outcome of interest , combin ing   “ definitely ”  and  “ probably ”   into one group   and “ probably   not ”  and  “ definitely not ”  into another group.  The decision to dichotomize this item was based on the research question of interest, respective response option group sizes, and supported by similar vaccination and uptake  research."
"31" "In addition to likelihood of  childhood  COVID-19  vaccine uptake, participants were  asked to rate their level of trust in  varying government  public  health agencies :  respective  local or county department of health,  Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services  (MODHSS) ,  and  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CD C ) .  Level of trust was  scored for each  agency  on a scale of 1 to 4  with  4 being “ definitely trust ” and 1 being “ definitely do not trust. ”   Overall trust in  public  health agencies was calculated by summing scale of each agency  with a possible  maximum score of 1 2 , indicating the highest level of trust in health agencies, and a possible minimum of 4 , indicating the lowest level of trust in  public  health agencies."
"32" "Socio-demographic variables  of  age, race, highest level of education, annual household income, and urbanicity of residence , were included in analysis according to a priori identification of influence on vaccine intent 15,19 . Urbanicity designation was based on  county  of residence for each respondent and utilized the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the Office of Rural Health Policy’s (ORH) classification system which defines a county as (1) urban, (2) suburban, or (3) rural based on location respective of the nearest metropolitan area. Under this definition, a county is classified as urban if all census-tracts are within a metropolitan area; rural if all census tracts are outside of a metropolitan area; or suburban if the county contains some census-tracts that can be considered rural. While many definitions of urbanicity exist, given the constraints of geographic granularity  among respondents and a necessity for anonymity, the often used “HRSA definition,” was determined to be the most appropriate to address this research question."
"33" "The rate of COVID-19 cases according to respective county of residents at the time of survey completion was also applied as a likely predictor of vaccine uptake intent. COVID-19 case data and rate calculations were collected from the MDHSS."
"34" "In order to assess the differences of vaccine intent, bivariate analyses were conducted using chi-square test of independence for categorical variables and independent t-test  or Kruskal -Wallis test,  depending   on normality ,  for continuous variables to determine association between socio-demographics and  vaccination  intention for child ren. Characteristics with a  bivariate  probability value of  <0.100 were entered into an adjusted  logit model and marginal effects were calculated  predicting probability of childhood vaccine intent .  Due to preliminary results , f urther effects were calculated  among subpopulations .   All s ignificance was determined at α=0.05. Multicollinearity was assessed using variance inflation factors and model effect coefficients were converted to  marginal effects .  Due to preliminary findings,  average marginal effects of trust in  public  health agencies were  also  calculated  within  each  level  of urbanicity .    All analysis was completed using R 4.0."
"35" "Results"
"36" "Among the 238- parent  sample, 45.5% (n=106) reported an intent to  vaccinate   their  children against COVID-19 .   Most of the sample  identified as male (n=133, 55%), reported living in an urban ( n=92, 38.7% ) or suburban ( n=96, 40.3%)  area, being between the ages of 30 and 44 (n=130, 54.6%), and having at least a 4-year college degree (n=120, 54.4%). Over one-in-five participants, independently, reported being non-white (n=55, 23.1%), having a high school  diploma or less education (n=51, 21.4%), and reported an income of over $100,000 annually (n=48, 20.2%) ; o nly slightly higher than the proportion of those that reported being in the lowest income category of $30,000 or less annually (n=42, 17.6%). Sample  descriptives  along with bivariate testing according to intent to vaccinate children are detailed in Table 1"
"37" "The average COVID-19 rate per county was calculated to be 437.44 (+225.23) per 100,000 residents at time of survey completion."
"38" "On a scale of four to twelve, with twelve being the highest level of trust, the mean level of trust among those who intended to vaccine their children  was  9.42 ( + 2.07), significantly higher than those that did not intend to vaccinate their children, who had a mean trust level of 7.46 ( + 2.34). Two variables met the criteria for being included in the adjusted logit model: trust in  public  health agencies and urbanicity of residence.  Independent tests of associations revealed that among the variables in Table 1, trust in  public  health agency was significantly associated with intent to vaccina te children  against COVID-19 (p=0.001)."
"39" "Adjusted model marginal effects, detailed in Table 2,  reveals  that for every one - unit increase in  trust in  public  health agencies, probability of intent to vaccinate children against COVID-19 increases  near 7% (95% CI  0.0 531,  0.0 865, p<0.001).   Urban residents ,   compared to rural residents,   had a significantly increased probability (AME  0.1636 , 95% CI 0.0112, 0.3159, p =0.035)  of intent to vaccinate children against COVID-19. Similarly, suburban residents had a 17%  increased probability , compared to rural residents, of intent to vaccinate children against COVID-19 (AME 0.1714, 95% CI 0.0200 , 0.3238, p=0.027)."
"40" "The marginal effects of trust in  public  health agencies  was   highest among urban residents with each unit increase in trust leading to a  9 % increase of probability of  childhood COVID-19 vaccination (AME 0.0907 , 95% CI 0.0589, 0.1225, p<0.001).  Among rural residents, trust had a smaller marginal effect  with each unit increase leading to a 7.79% inc rease in probability of childhood COVID-19 vaccination among parents (AME 0.0779, 95% CI 0.0321, 0.1238, p<0.001).  The varying effects of trust  among differing  types of geography  is illustrated in the three-dimensional plot in Figure 1 ; revealing  a higher level of trust in public health agencies was needed among rural residents in the association to vaccinate children against COVID-19."
"41" "Discussion"
"42" "This study set   out to determine how the role of trust in health agencies , including local health departments, state health departmen ts, and federal health agencies  may be associated with  intent of parents to vaccinate  their  children against COVID-19.  Several key findings were identified from study results  that highlight not only the importance of trust, but  also how the association of trust on intent to vaccinate children varies across different environments.  Public health  agencies  should prioritize communication strategies to enhance trust  in community members."
"43" "Overall, among sample participants, most reported they did not intend to vaccinate their children against COVID-19  if a vaccine was available .  While   the number of  similar studies exploring intent of parents/guardians  to vaccinate children against COVID-19  are  few ,  several  recent studies have explored COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy among  adults. 19-21   Findings show i ntent  to receive the  COVID-19 vaccine  range s  from  40 % to  80 %  among U.S. adul ts ,  with parents seemingly more likely to uptake the vaccine .  Differences between previous studies and results from this study  could be attributed to several factors . First, timing may play a prominent role in vaccine intent as more information  regarding COVID-19 vaccination occurs  and social acceptance is adopted. Second,  our findings may suggest an important divergence between self-vaccination intent and intent to vaccinate children.  While  self-vaccination against COVID-19 was outside the scope of this study, results  support  further investigation ."
"44" "Most prominently, our results suggest a significant association between not only trust in health agencies and intent to vaccinate children, but also  geography  of  residency .   As the level of trust in  public  health agencies increased, the probability of intent to vaccinate children  significantly increased .   However,  the effect of trust  was  found  to  vary across   types of geography .  The effect of trust on  intent to vaccinate children  were  lower  for  rural  residents compared to  urban  residents ,  thus   a  higher  level of trust  is needed among rural residents  to reach similar probability of vaccination compared to urban residents.   This variation  suggest s a contextual difference   that exists within environments ; one that is  likely due to the different experiences each community has had with COVID-19.  Studies have continuously  identified  geographical gaps in health outcomes that include isolated rural areas w h ere access and availability are limited . 22"
"45" "While sample recruitment was standardized for  population characteristics,   t his study was limited due to the  selective  recruitment  pool  of likely voters .   I t is unclear if recruitment for a different primary purpose would provide a sample with different patterns of intention  to  vaccinate children .  Additionally, t his cross-sectional study was conducted over a short period of time  while there were no FDA-approved vaccines for adults , thus  intention to  vaccinate children  may change over longer periods  of collection  in conjunction with release of  vaccine  and COVID-19  information. Yet  still , the insights  garnered  from this study highlight  the challenges related to parental vaccine hesitance for their children and opportunities for better informed interventions when a vaccine for children is available ."
"46" "While the current minimum age for COVID-19 vaccinations range from  16   to  18 years old,  clinical  trials are underway for  children as young as 6 months.  As COVID-19 rates persist and mitigation policies remain geographically inconsistent , pharmaceutical prevention efforts are a necessary strategy   to  end   the current pandemic.   What role children play in  viral transmission and COVID-19 prevalence is not yet fully understood .  Regardless, addressing mistrust  in  public  health agencies  to decrease barriers in recommended medical  preventative treatment  is especially essential for populations who rely on other  to make medical decisions for them."
