COVID-19 and primary care: A critical need for strengthening emergency
preparedness across health systems

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted every frontier of
human lives. When it comes to emergency care for any health emergency for
individuals, or primary care where people make their first contact with the health
system in a country, this pandemic has shown the lack of preparedness on delivering
medical care in both settings. An integrative yet holistic perspective is needed to
strengthen emergency medicine and primary care across health systems, which may
enable us to save more lives during this pandemic and be better prepared for the next
one.

In this regard, the recent work of Kumar and colleagues appears to be a meaningful
contribution to this emerging area of global health reform.1 In their systematic
review of reviews, the authors synthesized nine intertwined themes on emergency
and primary care collaboration during COVID-19. Systematic reviews of reviews,
also known as umbrella reviews, are considered as one of the highest quality of
evidence for healthcare policymaking and practice.2–4 Such syntheses of evidence
may potentially inform how health problems may affect populations and what areas
should be prioritized for effective policymaking and program development in public
health systems. In the light of COVID-19, we need to revisit how primary care is
conceptualized and utilized alongside emergency management in care of public
health emergencies. The current evidence suggests inclusive health policymaking
that may empower specialties such as family medicine and emergency medicine,
2

which may improve health outcomes during this pandemic. Several domains should
be investigated through primary research and evidence synthesis that may
complement inclusive policymaking for pandemic preparedness.

First, in recent years, digital health interventions have shown promising impacts in
terms of increasing access to health services and improving health outcomes in
different contexts.5,6 More research is needed on COVID-19 that may inform how
such technological advancements can facilitate potential strengthening efforts
targeting emergency and primary care.

Second, most reviews synthesized studies from high-income countries except China.
Since the pandemic has impacted almost every nation globally, it is critical to
promote emergency and primary care research in under-represented countries that
share a higher disease burden but may have limited resources to investigate local
health issues.7 It is necessary to promote local and regional research assessing factors
influencing the organization and delivery of emergency and primary care services.

Third, socioeconomic disparities may impact the provision of and access to
emergency and primary care in different countries. As a public health emergency
such as COVID-19 is a common threat for individuals and populations, health
services, irrespective of places and sociodemographic divides, should be made
available for everyone. Therefore, the call for strengthening emergency and primary
care during this pandemic aligns with the global vision of universal health coverage
(UHC). Countries and global health agencies need to identify the barriers and
facilitators of UHC to strengthen future pandemic preparedness.
3

Fourth, special emphasis should be given to psychosocial needs of general population
and healthcare providers. During COVID-19 pandemic, people may experience high
burden of mental health problems that may remain underdiagnoses and
undertreated.8–13 The role of primary care providers is critical to address such issues
during emergency management in their workplaces. Psychosocial care should be
given to the providers as well, so that they can fulfil their professional responsibilities
during this pandemic.

Lastly, capacity building across health systems is critical for preparing people and
healthcare organizations to mitigate the current pandemic and future crises.14 The
current evidence informs how global knowledge domains can be evaluated to identify
common domains of healthcare management and leadership. Strategies should be
adopted, including the development of educational curricula for health sciences
professionals, health promotion programs for patients and their caregivers, and
targeted interventions enabling patient-centric care. Such multipronged efforts may
empower emergency and primary care systems to address individual and community
health problems during global health emergencies.
