"8" "Abstract:"
"9" "There are concerns that the  socioeconomic consequences of  COVID-19 , including unemployment and financial insecurity,   are  having adverse effects on the mental wellbeing of the population .  One group particularly vulnerable to socioeconomic a dversity  during this period are those employed freelance within the creative and cultural industries.  Many workers in the sector were already subject to income instability, erratic work schedules and a lack of economic security before the pandemic, and it is possible that COVID-19 may exacerbate  pre- existing economic precarity. Through interviews with 20  freelancers working within the performing arts, visual arts, and film and television industries, this article explores the  impact of the pandemic on their working lives. Findings suggest the pandemic is affecting the psychological wellbeing of freelancers  through   employment loss, financial instability and  work dissonance, and illustrates the need for  urgent  economic and psychosocial support for those employed within this sector."

"12" "Introduction"
"13" "In response to COVID-19, many governments have imposed restrictions of varying stringency that have impacted on the daily lives of the general population.  In the UK, this has included self-isolation, mobility constraints and the closure of all but non-essential businesses in efforts to suppress the virus  (Iacobucci, 2020) .   It is already evident that these containment measures have resulted in not only severe psychosocial adversities  (Brooks et al., 2020; Pierce et al., 2020) , but acute economic consequences for workers and businesses unable to adapt to these conditions  (International Labour Organization, 2020) .  Consequently, many workers have been subject to  employment  inactivity (e.g. furlough) , income loss  or unemployment  (Hensher, 2020; Witteveen & Velthorst, 2020) .  In the UK, 9.3 million people have entered the  COVID-19  job retention scheme and another 2.7 million have claimed a self-employment income support scheme grant. Unemployment has also risen since the advent of the pandemic and is projected  to increase throughout  2021  (ONS, 2020a) ."
"14" "Although most workers are likely to be at-risk of socioeconomic adversity during this period, one  group who are  particularly vulnerable are  those  employed freelance  within  the creative and cultural industries (CCI) .  There are a number of reasons for this. First,  the fragility of the sector  before  COVID-19 is widely acknowledged, including   the financial precariousness of its workforce  (e.g. income instability, erratic work schedules and a lack of economic security) and previous  susceptibility to economic shocks (e.g.  the 2008 global  recession)  (Banks, 2020; Brook et al., 2018; de Peuter, 2011) .  Major  s ocioeconomic transformations  in response to COVID-19   are  therefore  likely to  have  exacerbate d any  pre-existing  economic   vulnerability. Second, many creative freelancers   are reliant on  cultural production sites  (e.g. theatres, studios, nightclubs) for economic activity (through performances, for example). In the UK, government-mandated closures of these venues resulted in the immediate curtailing of income-facilitating activities , and there is uncertainty as to when they may reopen to allow activity to resume .  As such, many freelancers have been exposed to prolonged periods of economic inactivity.  Third, owing to the flexible nature of freelance  employment   in the CCI,  whereby workers regularly move in and out of contract s , take on unpaid  roles  and work  concurrently  in other  sectors  (Throsby & Zednik, 2011) ,  many have been ineligible for economic support in response to the pandemic. The UK COVID-19  s elf- e mployment  i ncome  s upport  s cheme, for example, required a record of tax returns and for freelance work to make up at least 50% of overall income for those based in England. As a result, newly self - employed freelancers or those with  “ portfolio ”  careers were ineligible  (Comunian & England, 2020) .  The economic consequences of C OVID -19   therefore present ed  unique  socioeconomic  challenges to this workforce ,  including financial instability and  potential  unemployment ."
"15" "Socioeconomic insecurity is a known trigger for adverse psychological consequences, including mental distress, depression and anxiety  (Marmot, 2005; Marmot et al., 2012; Paul & Moser, 2009) .  Previous literature has indicated how   p eriods of economic recession are related to adverse mental health through factors such as  job loss ,  financial insecurity and declining  living  standards  (Barlow et al., 2015; Marmot et al., 2013) .  Moreover, p erceived job loss and the prospect of financial adversity  have been  associated with  a range of mental health symptoms during prior economic recessions   (Burgard et al., 2012) .  Some have suggested that similar factors could adversely affect the health  and wellbeing  of unemployed workers after COVID-19  (Hensher, 2020) : indeed, there is recent evidence demonstrating how COVID-19   induced economic hardship (including job loss, workload decline and  worries relating to finance) is already having  adverse  effects on the psychological wellbeing of the population  (Witteveen & Velthorst, 2020; Wright et al., 2020) ."
"16" "It is widely recognised that those who are already vulnerable,  whether this be due to experiencing employment precarity or for other reasons , are most at risk of health consequences during major economic changes  (Marmot et al., 2013) .   Given their pre-existing socioeconomic vulnerabilities, it is reasonable to assume that creative freelancers  may therefore incur significant psychosocial distress in the present context.  T hose working in the arts, film and television industries are particularly vulnerable, with a number of risk factors for poor mental health stemming from the precarity of  artists’  career s , including feelings of despair, insecurity and social isolation   (Duarte, 2020) . More specifically, w orking in the performing arts industry has previously been connected to adverse mental health, with musicians experiencing stress  (Gembris et al., 2018; Parasuraman & Purohit, 2000) , depression, distress and anxiety   (Stoeber & Eismann, 2007) .  Relatedly,  a survey of 4877 people working in the UK film, TV and cinema industry found that 87% experienced a mental health problem  and  lower levels of subjective wellbeing than  the  national average   (Wilkes et al., 2020) .   This is significant given that existing psychosocial adversities may impair resilience to significant economic changes and influence the duration of unemployment  (Butterworth et al., 2012) . Given that creative freelancers may need to withstand periods of economic inactivity in response to lockdown measures, they may therefore require targeted psychosocial support to assist with these unique support needs."
"17" "Despite the risks posed by socioeconomic adversities to creative freelancers ’  mental health and wellbeing, little is known  about the specific challenges faced by freelancers in the current context beyond quantitative enquiry  (Comunian & England, 2020; Nesta Creative Industries, 2020) .  Accordingly, there is a need for  qualitative  research  that can provide in-depth data on  the experiences of this population during the pandemic. The is necessary to  aid our understanding of specific socioeconomic stressors among this  population, and to assist in the  development of future psychosocial and economic support for those at   risk of  financial  hardship , both as the economic effects of COVID-19 persist and in future periods of economic instability . To these ends, the study aimed to explore qualitatively   the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the working lives of creative freelancers in the UK, including any subsequent implications for mental health and wellbeing ."
"18" "Methods"
"19" "The research employed a qualitative design using semi-structured interviews with self-employed creative freelancers working in the CCI. Participants were interviewed between July – November 2020 about their lived experiences of the pandemic, including any socioeconomic impacts resulting from C OVID -19.   The study formed the qualitative component of the UCL COVID-19 Social Study, a large nationwide study using survey data to explore the effects of COVID-19 and social distancing measures on adults in the UK."
"20" "Sample and Recruitment"
"21" "Convenience sampling was used to recruit self-employed freelancers working in the CCI from across the UK ,  with a particular focus on those  employed  within the performing arts, visual arts, and film and television industries  due to their  greater risk of employment precarity   (Duarte, 2020; Wilkes et al., 2020) .   In practice, this involved recruiting participants through a combination of methods including social media, personal contacts,  the UKRI-funded MARCH Network,  and via the UCL COVID-19 Social Study (including through its newsletter and website). The convenience approach was augmented with purposive sampling to ensure diversity of gender, age, and professional role. Eligibility was based primarily on whether the person was (or had recently been) self-employed  in an arts, film or television career , aged over 18, and living in the UK. Participation in the research was voluntary ,  and all participants were provided with details either verbally or in writing about the nature and purpose of the research and what their participation would involve.  D emographic details were also obtained. Ethical approval was provided by University College London research ethics committe e [ Project ID 14895/005] and all participants provided written informed consent."
"22" "Data Collection"
"23" "Semi-structured telephone or video call interviews were conducted by  TM  ( research fellow in social science ),  RC (research fellow in public health), JD (research fellow in public health and qualitative research) and SE (research assistant)  using a pre-prepared topic guide that posed questions about the participant’s subjective experience(s) of the impact of the pandemic on work, mental health and social life. Interviews lasted an average of  45 minutes,  and participants were offered compensation for their time in the form of  a  £10 high street voucher."
"24" "With participant  consent , the interviews were digitally recorded and subsequently transcribed verbatim by a professional transcription service. Data collection concluded once the theoretical saturation of themes occurred  or,  in other words, where instances of data emerged consistently and le d to the conclusion that no further data would develop new properties, categories or findings  (Strauss, 1999) ."
"25" "Data Analysis"
"26" "Following anonymisation, transcripts were uploaded to NVivo version 12 software to enable computerised data analysis. A reflexive thematic approach was adopted in line with the principles of  Braun and Clarke  (2006, 2012) , whereby one  first  familiarises themselves with the data  before  the generation and definition of codes, the searching of themes, and  the production of a report . As such, five transcripts were initially read independently by two researchers ( TM  and  KW ), who coded and discussed any emerging codes that were of potential significance to the research objectives. A preliminary coding framework, informed  deductively by concepts within the topic guide, was used to guide the coding of these transcripts. An inductive approach was then used to refine the framework to reflect  on  any emerging themes or concepts within the data and applied to the remaining transcripts by  TM, who re-read transcripts and coded and synthesised text into categories, which were subsequently analysed and grouped into themes (Braun and Clarke, 2006; 2012) . The qualitative research team met weekly to discuss and iteratively refine any new codes or themes emerging from this stage. This process helped to ensure that the final extracted themes were not just the personal interpretation of one team member."
"27" "Results"
"28" "Twenty  participants who worked in a range of professions with in  the CCI were interviewed. Participants were aged 22-76, predominantly female (55%) and White British (55%)."

"55" "I nterviews generated a rich body of data covering a range of issues relat ing  to the experiences of freelancers during the pandemic , including experiences of social distancing and social isolation measures, inequalities in the CCI and personal relationship changes .  T he data presented here , however,  focus  specifically on  the  socioeconomic  changes produced by COVID-19 and their relationship with mental  and social  wellbeing. This  issu e  was related to   three specific themes which will be discussed in turn below: (1) Employment Precarity, (2) Financial Implications, and (3) Work Dissonance.  T hese  themes  are presented in Figure 1 ,  along with their respective subthemes."
"56" "Figure 1.  Themes and subthemes"
"57" "Employment precarity"
"58" "Loss of  w ork"
"59" "The advent of COVID-19 resulted in  government-mandated closures of theatres, music venues, nightclubs and studios . For most participants, this resulted in the immediate  loss  of work ( “ And then, this happened in February, and everything, all my work just disappeared overnight, pretty much ” , ID1_musician ). While some participants made use of online technologies to continue work, some felt this financially unsustainable or noted limitations  with  remote working  (see  “ online difficulties ” ). Consequently, many participants expressed feelings of insecurity about the return of employment. As one musician explained:"
"60" "“ I think I’m just worried about how it’s going to get back to where it was, because it’s a lot of very closed and cramped spaces within the Arts. In terms of managing to keep our distance for a long enough time, the virus isn’t going to go away…but I think it’s going to take a very long time for it to actually get back for performing to be the sole income, basically for a freelancer ”  (ID1_musician)"
"61" "Most participants reported that periods of fallow employment were not uncommon.  I t was not unusual , for example,  for participants to  describe  periods of income instability  before  COVID-19 ( “ I’ve had times where I’ve maybe brought in about £200 worth of income in a month ” , ID2_documentary producer ), and many spoke of  the  existing  “ precariousness ” ,  “ instability ”  and  “ uncertainty ”  of freelance work. However, participants noted that the duration and severity of COVID-19 restrictions had exacerbated these worries. Combined with  prolonged  uncertainty surrounding the reopening of venues, pre-existing insecurities were  therefore  felt more acutely:"
"62" "“ All the normal worries you have as a freelancer suddenly feel more real and more relevant. During this period I’ve felt very aware of the financial precariousness of being freelance, not having savings, living alone and therefore only having the one income. All those things together are fine when it all works, but one thing dropping I’ve realised, or taken more  notice of, how risky that is. So I feel this sort of general sense of precariousness in the world that perhaps I didn’t feel before ”  (ID3_artist)"
"63" "The immediate loss of work was a  challenging  experience, particularly as some participants   reported deriving  enjoyment and meaning from their careers .  Those who lost jobs were greatly affected and voiced  insecurities and concerns . Stress and anxiety were not uncommon ( “ It’s  just constantly on my mind. I go through peaks and troughs of feeling quite anxious, and then telling myself that it might all get better ” , ID4_theatre producer)  as were worries relating to the future of the CCI  ( “ Sure, yes, in so many ways…the stress and anxiety about what was going to happen to my industry ” , ID14_theatre producer ).  Some participants also reported physical symptoms, including sleep problems that were linked to these  concerns :"
"64" "“ I think my sleep got messed up, especially when lockdown first kicked in. I had a lot of weird dreams going around my head. So, I think it did have an effect on that. I guess because it was just so much information to process, from news and a different way of life ”  (ID20_musician)"
"65" "Loss of social support networks"
"66" "T he foundations of social and employability support were also   affected by  lockdown measures . Many participants noted the value of colleagues for emotional and social support and as a  helpful  resource for information sharing, often  about  employment opportunities. For example, one participant described how social networks were  a useful conduit  for obtaining and sharing news about the industry:"
"67" "“ Even going to dance classes, it’s a time for us to all catch up with each other and socialise, as well as keeping up our training.  Then, it’s also how we find out about what’s going on.  I would say classes are a real key community event for us ”  (ID18_dance teacher)"
"68" "Given that participants were unable to meet colleagues face-to-face,  participants  noted how  the  loss of these networks reduced opportunities for information sharing, socialising and networking . For example, participants were unable to meet with colleagues  in work settings where much of their social life was concentrated ( “ a nd it’s one of the features of my week that I see them every week and we have a lovely time making music together. All of that of course stopped completely and I think that the sense of being unable to go to  work  where my social life is centred …all that went completely ” ,   ID6_ m usician ), as well as in social situations where  networking  often occurred ( “ We would just invite people…if you wanted to meet new people and exchange ideas and have some dinner together. So that stopped completely during the pandemic ” ,  ID19_ d ocumentary  p roducer ) .  For some,   the destabilisation of these support structures impacted on their wellbeing, too:"
"69" "“ I am by nature, a hugely social musician. I get my wellbeing from meeting a lot of musicians and working with them and seeing something develop from stage A to stage B and feeling perhaps some responsibility for that process. And sitting in your study, looking at your text, doesn’t do that in quite the same way ”   (ID6_musician)"
"70" "Financial implications"
"71" "Income  l oss"
"72" "W ithout the ability to engage in creative work, there were limited opportunities to obtain income in the CCI. Some participants  therefore  reported reductions in annual income in response to  workload decline  ( “ It’s led to the almost complete elimination of my income ” ,  ID6_ m usician )   or experienced substantial financial losses  following  the cancellation of events ( “ Yes, I must have lost about £25,000 worth of work this year ” , ID7_theatre director ). Due to the nature of freelance work   which is often based on the scheduling of activities months in advance, these financial implications were often protracted ( “ I haven’t had any income coming in for a couple of months and there won’t be anything until [3 months] from now ” ,  ID8_musician )."
"73" "With restricted incomes, many participants reported difficulties with managing day-to-day essentials. This included concerns about the ability to pay utilities, including household bills ( “ Well, financially, I went from feeling that I was really able to pay my bills, to completely cut off bare ” ,   ID9_theatre director ) and rent ( “ I can’t pay rent if I don’t work ” ,  ID10_actor).  Some noted how financial disruptions had implications for material possessions  ( “ I would have been able to go out and buy a new car, I could’ve got myself my new phone ” ,  ID11_production associate ) and the maintenance of existing lifestyles ( “ my lifestyle’s very expensive because of all the travel…so my savings are not as secure as I’d like them to be, and that feeling of, oh my god, this could all end, is so frightening ” ,   ID7_theatre director ). For some, the solution to these difficulties was to seek financial support from parents or partners. Often, however, this was a source of embarrassment:"
"74" "“ I’m blessed my parents are helping me out with money at the moment. At the age of 47, it is embarrassing as I’ve been financially independent since the age of 18...without that, I would be getting close to struggling ”  (ID12_musician)"
"75" "With no immediate prospect of work and associated income returning, participants reported distress that was detrimental to their wellbeing:"
"76" "“ The only pressure really has been this thing about money. It’s just money. I haven’t felt pressure in other ways. It’s been difficult, I want to be able to go into my parents’ house. I want to be able to see my son and my sister. But that’s probably been the most hardship. It’s financial and it’s that insecurity that’s the worst ”  (ID11_production associate)"
"77" "Economic  s upport"
"78" "Participants reported a lack of  economic support to assist with these  financial difficulties. Many alluded to difficulties in obtaining funding and the narrow eligibility criteria  required  for government support. One participant, who worked in multiple freelance roles, was unable to access government support and was instead reliant on Jobseekers’ Allowance to support them  through this period :"
"79" "“ Then of course lockdown came and everything like that and to cut a long story short I then found out that I didn’t fit into any government scheme. I  was not PAYE enough, my PAYE contract had ended at the end of January so I missed out on all the dates. I wasn’t self-employed enough because I’d had so many different PAYE contracts I hadn’t built up enough contributions to be able to qualify. So I was left with nothing apart from £74 a week contributions-based Jobseeker’s Allowance. It was crap to be quite honest ”  (ID11_production associate)"
"80" "Some participants implied  that this lack of support  was  because of  a  general devaluation of the  CCI by the UK government .  Many of these participants felt unsupported and suggested that, compared to other sectors, the arts were not a priority ( “ I don’t believe that at its core, this government cares about it at all …and I think that the danger is there’s not a consensus that restoring the arts is at the top of anybody’s priority list ” , ID6_musician ) .  As a result,  some  reported feelings of increasing despair and helplessness:"
"81" "“ So now I think I feel obsolete, I feel redundant, I feel abandoned, I feel hopeless. I feel that me and my family don’t matter….now that I need help I’m not being given any , a nd I am angry. I feel   disenfranchised ” (ID11_production associate)"
"82" "However , some participants embodied a hope narrative that economic support would  be provided by the government in the future  ( “ The general feeling is that there’s real relief that the government have finally announced some sort of package ” , ID9_theatre director ) .  Consequently, some participants remained optimistic  that their financial difficulties would only be short term .  This optimism also extended to a perception that economic support for the  CCI at large would alter public perceptions, resulting in increased funds and  “ exciting ”  creative outputs :"
"83" "“ I hope that there’s a shift in appreciation of it and hopefully, that will manifest itself in more money and more funding being available and therefore, more work and more people accessing the arts and things like that.  I am hopeful for the future, actually and I do think there will be some exciting things that come out of it ”  (ID18_ documentary producer)"
"84" "Work dissonance"
"85" "The socioeconomic changes resulting from COVID-19 were found to cause  not only  employment and financial instability, but dissonance  associated with  work ing  in this context. This related to  changes to the work environment (e.g. homeworking) and  difficulties in adapting work in response to COVID-19  (e.g. online) . Pre-existing financial concerns among most participants were also exacerbated by COVID-19, leading to more general feelings of  insecurity . Subsequently, some participants expressed a desire to locate employment outside of the CCI  in the hope of greater  financial stability. Given that the majority of participants derived meaning and enjoyment from their creative careers, this was a source of unease."
"86" "Homeworking"
"87" "In response to social distancing regulations, many freelancers were required to work from home .  Such work was often at odds with many of their former (and ideal) work activities, including interacting with colleagues and peers ( “ everything that I do is with people. It’s pretty  much face to face. There’s a limit to the effectiveness of what you can do online ” ,  ID12_musician ) and performing to live audiences ( “ the real life for me in terms of being able to perform for people in crowds ” ,  ID13_musician ). The realities of homeworking were also often unconducive to creative work: childcare, for example, was noted as one significant impediment to workflow. Some participants reported working in the evenings to accommodate  this , which presented additional psychological stresses:"
"88" "“ And all of that, I had to do in the evenings, because that was the only work time I had. So, my work shift would be 8PM until midnight or something, most nights. So, that was additionally stressful ”   (ID14_theatre producer)"
"89" "Some participants also described struggling with tasks and a general lack of purpose whil e  working from home. For some, the inability to fulfil work tasks and be creative led to a general feeling of malaise:"
"90" "“ But I would say my output since the middle of March has been 10% of what it would normally be. And that’s not a good sense, as I’m sure you can recognise, in that it’s not psychologically supportive ”  (ID6_musician)"
"91" "Online  d ifficulties"
"92" "Interrelated to the challenges of homeworking, s ome  participants  reported attempting to modify work - including performances, meetings, and auditions - to suit online platforms. Whil e  this was beneficial in the short term, most participants noted several difficulties. For one, many  online performances were often unpaid and therefore had little financial incentive. Some freelancers felt this would potentially  “ demonetize ”  future creative work:"
"93" "“ So all of that was a bonus, but of course it’s also an anxiety for me, because all this music online is free, which demonetizes what I do, and raises long-term issues as to whether they’ll ever want to pay for anything ever again, because they can get it all free online ”  (ID6_musician)"
"94" "Second, some participants reported difficulties with attempting to perform or rehearse online. For example, some noted the  “ stilled ”  nature of video messaging   which limited the spontaneity and impulsiveness required for creative work. This reduced the quality of outputs achieved through such methods .  Consequently, most participants felt that moving creative work online was not practical:"
"95" "“ We tried to sing [online] but it just didn’t work because of the latency so we were like yes, we can’t really do that ”  (ID5_musician)"
"96" "Finally, many participants stated the importance of   socialising and networking  with colleagues . To compensate for lack of face-to-face contact, many freelancers transitioned to online  platforms  to converse. One participant described how a colleague had set up an online support group  to support one another  over the lockdown period ( “ One of my friends, basically, on a Thursday lunchtime, she has open house in her personal Zoom room, and a group of us just drop in and hang out ” ,  ID17_production associate ). However, participants conceded that such methods were limited in comparison to physical interactions and support ( “ being a tactile human being, I think giving people hugs and things is very important for me certainly ” ,  ID6_musician ). Participants also noted how a lack of opportunities for face-to-face socialising increased feelings of isolation and loneliness:"
"97" "“ I have been feeling quite lonely, because of not being able to see people in person and that being something I enjoy. Even things like networking professionally or whatever, I enjoy being around people, I like people, and you’ve kind of lost that chance encounter with people ”  (ID17_production associate)"
"98" "Leaving the  CCI"
"99" "For some, the solution  to the challenges brought about by COVID-19  was to consider new forms of employment. This was particularly true of young freelancers or those without financial support in the form of savings or financial assistance from parents/partner. Whil e  some maintained optimism about a return to work   and therefore saw this as a temporary measure, others described COVID-19 as  “ decimating ”  their industry and future career plans ( “ I’m scared for myself and singing. For me, I think the nail is already in the coffin with regards to singing and being paid for it ” ,  ID13_musician ). As such, some participants were actively considering other forms of employment, as one musician explained:"
"100" "“ I’m questioning, should I still be a musician? How is this going to survive? I think especially as a freelancer, who’s got no real working rights as it is, really, in the music industry, is there any point in continuing it? Because although I enjoy it, if there’s no money and there’s no work  happening for at least a year and a half, it’s like how are you meant to sustain that? ”  (ID1_musician)"
"101" "Whil e  some welcomed the stability of  “ 9-5 jobs ”  ( “ I certainly have been considering teaching more full-time and to be quite honest I’m okay with that ” ,  ID8_musician ), others reported unease at potentially transitioning into alternative industries. Most participants described working in the CCI in  favourable  terms, reporting that creative work was  essential  to their self-identity:  many defined themselves through such work ( “ I definitely am aware that I lot of my identity is my work and the work I do ” ,  ID2_documentary  producer ).  As a result, most participants showed little motivation for alternative, non-creative forms of employment. Most reported that this would result in the loss of many of the things they enjoyed about freelance creative work, including the ability to express oneself creatively ( “ Ultimately, you’re exploring yourself and what it means to be human and what makes us laugh and what makes us cry … it’s honestly just playtime ” ,  ID10_ a ctor) ,  autonomy  ( “ I can dictate what I work on and who I work with and how long I work on it for, which I really, really love and would not give that up ” ,  ID16_ d ance  t eacher ) and enjoyment ( “ We do it because we love it ” , ID11_production associate ). One freelancer felt that  that this  would  also  erode any previous hard work that had enabled him to reach this stage in his career:"
"102" "“ I trained for this career. I’ve worked very hard in this career. I’ve managed to survive in this career for quite a bit of time. Why should I have to give up my career because of this? ”  (ID15_actor)"
"103" "Participants, therefore, reported that thoughts of leaving the CCI were a source of stress and unease. For one participant, being unable to perform a job he enjoyed in the future would have psychological implications:"
"104" "“ Just trying to work out whether that means that I have to renegotiate where I place my purpose, whether that comes from a different career, or whether that comes from staying in what I’m doing…so, there is quite a lot of thinking, I would think I’ve still a lot to do around, and at the moment, it’s probably manifesting itself as generalised anxiety about the future ”  (ID9_theatre director)"
"105" "Discussion"
"106" "This study investigated the  impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the working lives of creative freelancers in the UK  and   revealed a range of socioeconomic challenges. This included three types of adversity, including employment precarity (including  disrupted and reduced workloads ), financial instability (including   financial  hardship ), and  work dissonance  (including transitioning to new   forms of employment  outside of the CCI) .  These  socioeconomic adversities  were found to have psychological consequences for participants, including  low mood ,  depression, anxiety and psychosomatic symptoms. Our findings thus align with existing research  confirming  the relationship between socioeconomic insecurity  (including unemployment, perceived job insecurity and financial difficulty)  and  implications for  mental health   (Kim & von dem Knesebeck, 2016; Paul & Moser, 2009; Witteveen & Velthorst, 2020; Wright et al., 2020) ."
"107" "In response to C OVID -19 restrictions,  we found that  many participants were subject to either  the  temporary or permanent loss of employment. Although participants reported pre-existing  worries  surrounding the precariousness of  freelance  work, a n   unfortunate  aspect of the C OVID -19 crises was the rapid onset of job loss and economic instability : the fact that unemployment was not anticipated meant some participants were unprepared and had little time to plan or find alternative employment.  In response, almost all participants who had lost their job reported some form of psychological distress. This is potentially concerning for the wellbeing of creative freelancers given that previous research has highlighted the long-term effects of employment transitions (including job loss) on mental health and wellbeing  (Barrech et al., 2016; Herber et al., 2019; Olesen et al., 2013; Thomas et al., 2005) . Moreover, even if job losses had not occurred, many participants reported worries about  future employment. Indeed, it has been suggested that worries about impending adversity are potentially more psychologically demanding than the experience itself  (Ferrie et al., 1995) . Given the uncertainty surrounding projected timeframes of lockdown measures and a reported lack of control over these circumstances, freelancers may therefore be particularly susceptible to periods of prolonged worrying or rumination about socioeconomic adversity. Many also reported cumulative worries - including financial difficulty and loss of paid work - that are closely related to poor mental health outcomes, including anxiety  (Wright et al., 2020) ."
"108" "All  participants expressed the importance of  work to provide financial resources that could be spent on essentials such as household bills, rent, and existing standards of living.  Our findings uncovered how  financial hardship  following job loss or economic inactivity, however,  resulted in difficulties in meeting these needs and a general decline in standards of living. For most participants ,  this was  a source of psychosocial strain and insecurity ;  a finding generally consistent with literature detailing pathways between  financial insecurity  and mental health   (Paul & Moser, 2009; Witteveen & Velthorst, 2020) .  This includes how inabilities to meet basic needs (such as food, rent, household bills) have implications for mental health through feelings of unease, anxiety, lack of control and insecurity  (Butterworth et al., 2009) .  O ur findings contribute to  understandings of  how C OVID- 19   induced reductions in income can  similarly  increase self-reported feelings of  mental distress ."
"109" "Issues beyond immediate disruptions to employment status and income were also evident. Forms of work dissonance served to destabilise previous work functioning and undermine the working ability of participants. For some, a movement to home working presented a number of work-related stressors, including shared workspaces with family members, childcare and  motivation issues. Relatedly, although most participants were comfortable with and had access to digital technology, the majority noted its incompatibility with creative forms of work. This included difficulties with remote group performances and a lack of digital connectivity.  Consequently, participants described struggling with routine tasks and a general  “ lack of purpose ”  whil e  working from home , which was a source of frustration given  that m ost   creative  freelan   cers  in the CCI derive  enjoyment and meaning from the ir work careers  (Gerber, 2017) . These changes resulted in an inability to engage in optimal and thus fulfilling work over lockdown periods  (Blustein & Guarino, 2020) , as evidenced by the general feelings of malaise reported in our findings. This is significant given the centrality of fulfilling forms of work to psychological wellbeing, including its ability to foster feelings of self-esteem, purpose and autonomy  (Blustein & Guarino, 2020; McGann et al., 2016) ."
"110" "Changes in working practices, including a migration toward remote and virtual working, may therefore require unique forms of support to ensure it is not only operationally practically but financially viable for freelancers. Some participants noted a potential demonetization of forms of creative work in response to COVID-19, whereby traditional, face-to-face performances had become superseded by unpaid online performances. Unpaid work is already widespread within the CCI and while this may be viable for some – such as those with existing financial security – for younger freelancers or those from lower socioeconomic positions it may serve as a barrier to  “ getting in and getting on ”  in the CCI (Brook et al. 2018: 20) . To limit the exacerbation of existing inequalities and to ensure greater diversity and representation in the CCI post-COVID-19, support should be tailored to those groups most susceptible to socioeconomic harm."
"111" "Many participants noted the destabilisation of social support structures that were previously an important resource for obtaining employment opportunities and assisting in situations of precarity  (Brook et al., 2018) . The loss of opportunities for socialisation meant support networks were weakened, and this limited both prospects for further employment and opportunities for social support. S ome participants detailed how  colleagues aided   those experiencing psychosocial distress in response to COVID-19 through online groups . This is a n  important insight for the CCI as it is a sector founded upon social networking   (Potts et al., 2008) ,  and suggests  that there may be untapped social resources   within the CCI itself   th at  can be instrumental  in  enhanc ing   coping resources  and reduc ing  the experiences of socioeconomic adversity  among this group. Harnessing the support of colleagues  is  especially important  given that  many participants reported being unable to access financial support intended for those in economic distress  (Komorowski & Lewis, 2020) . However, some participants noted that the online nature of this social support was insufficient in tackling deeper feelings of psychological distress caused by the circumstances."
"112" "Finally, some of our participants also embodied a hope narrative from the government’s pledge of further financial  aid , which ultimately did not provide extra support for all freelancers,  instead  prioritising institutions   (see Arts Council England, 2020) . Exploration of precarious work in the classical music  industry  has found that individuals adopt an entrepreneurial attitude to uncertainty,  thereby embracing  “ the kinds of subjectivities that are forged in order to succeed in the cultural and creative industries ”  (Scharff, 2017: 65) .   Thus, s ome of the individual-level ‘positive’ attitudes to ‘surviving’ the economic impact of COVID-19 evidenced in this article may be a  similar representation of such   logic , which ultimately shifts the burden of responsibility onto  the individual  and requires   them to remain ‘resilient’ in the face of socioeconomic adversity  (Comunian & England, 2020) .   Consequently,  individuals  may  perceive their successes or failures to be the result of individual efforts within a meritocratic system,  ultimately masking the need for structural change and leaving freelancers in the CCI without the institutional support required to navigate precarious working conditions."
"113" "Limitations"
"114" "These findings should be considered in light of a number of limitations. First, given the evolving nature  of  COVID-19 and  constant revision of  accompanying lockdown restrictions, it is likely that that the views and experiences of participants will vary depending on when they were interviewed. Interviews were conducted  between July – November 2020, shortly after  the  initial  lockdown period in the UK ( March – May 2020 ) ,  and therefore d o  not capture experiences  outside of this  timeframe.  Second , our sample was composed of freelancers from England, Scotland and Wales. The UK and devolved governments have coordinated different  lockdown  responses to COVID-19 within their areas of responsibility, and the views and experiences of participants are therefore likely to differ depending on imposed  restrictions and regulations within each administration. Relatedly, funding for freelancers in the CCI was distributed differently in each devolved nation, and it is possible that greater financial uncertainty occurred among freelancers in England given that Scotland and Wales provided specific support (such as the Creative Scotland bridging bursary) for those not eligible for self-employment grants.  As the majority of participants came from England,  however,  we  cannot  predict whether  our results  would have been different if we included a more geographically diverse sample.  Third , the study is limited by the fact that the sample is biased in favour of interviewees who were  motivated or  willing to participate. It may be possible that the views and experiences of those unable or unwilling to participate differ from those  documented in this study (e.g. unaffected by COVID-19 restrictions,  not worried by  job loss)  and have therefore not been represented in this study . Finally, our data covers a range of professions within the CCI. Whil e  this provides a breadth of different experiences, it may limit the specificity of the findings. Those employed in the theatre industry  may  have been impacted in different ways to those working in the  f ilm and  television  industry, for example. Conclusions drawn from the research must therefore be made with caution and considered within the context of these sampling limitations."
"115" "Conclusion"
"116" "Our study found that participants  experienced a range of socioeconomic adversities in response to COVID-19 restrictions, which had  psychological consequences for participants, including  low mood ,  depression, anxiety, and psychosomatic symptoms .  The implications of this  for the CCI, policymakers and health care services during the ongoing pandemic and beyond  are numerous ."
"117" "F irstly,  financial aid is required to support those in the CCI facing economic hardship , including those unable to work in the current circumstances or who have been ineligible for economic support  (Komorowski & Lewis, 2020) . This is necessary not only to support those experiencing deleterious mental health impacts in response to socioeconomic insecurity, but to ensure pre-existing disparities within the sector are not exacerbated. Indeed, it is possible that those able to withstand economic hardship in response to COVID-19 are likely to be those with existing financial resources or safety nets  (Brook et al., 2018) . It is therefore imperative that those most acutely affected are supported to ensure future inclusivity in the sector. Second, given that our findings provide further evidence of the  consistent association  between socioeconomic insecurity  (including unemployment, perceived job insecurity and financial difficulty)  and  implications for  mental health   (Kim & von dem Knesebeck, 2016; Paul & Moser, 2009; Wright et al., 2020) , the provision of specific and tailored wellbeing support should be extended to those subject to socioeconomic adversity in attempts to support adaptive coping strategies. This is especially important for creative freelancers given their increased exposure to prolonged periods of economic inactivity and vulnerability to financial shocks, as evidenced previously  (Banks, 2020; Brook et al., 2018)  and in this study. Relatedly, our research highlights the importance of social networks in providing reassurance and social support during periods of economic instability. This suggests that freelancers may benefit from online interventions that leverage the social and psychological support of peers in attempts to buffer negative psychological consequences. Finally, while these measures may help in mitigating the immediate socioeconomic effects of the pandemic, it is worth noting that many of the issues highlighted in this article existed well before the advent of COVID-19  (Banks, 2020; Brook et al., 2018) .  Hence, although economic and wellbeing support for freelancers is needed now more than ever, it is important that packages of support are provided beyond this period to address long-standing structural problems within the CCI, including the impact of socioeconomic precarity on its workforce."
