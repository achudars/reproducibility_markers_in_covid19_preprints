"7" "Abstract"
"8" "COVID-19  pandemic  is  affecting negatively  the  tourism  and hospitality  industry . As  people must avoid physical interaction,  service robots   can  be  a  useful tool to ensure a high level of physical social distance during  the  epidemic.  This paper  steps on available secondary data and  discusses  whether  the application of service robots to provide physical distance in tourism and hospitality context  is going to be beneficial  or there will be side effects as well. The paper posits that  service robots  create a  technological shield between tourists and employees  that increase s  the physical and emotional distance between them.   Tourism and hospitality companies need to complement robots with other technologies to provide social connectedness and offset the negative consequences of physical distancing."

"10" "Introduction"
"11" "Like any other industries, currently, the hospitality and tourism industry has also been affected significantly by   information  and  communication technologies ( Benckendorff, Xiang, & Sheldon, 2019 ). Recently, thanks to the  progress  in artificial intelligence and robotics (Miller & Miller, 2017; Russell & Norvig, 2016),  tourism and hospitality  companies start to adopt  a wide range of  service robots  (humanoid, zoomorphic, or more machine-looking robots)   with various levels of technical capabilities  as guides, hosts, porters, cooking staff, room servers, housekeeping attendants, bellboys, waiters, etc .  ( Drexler & Lapré, 2019;  Ivanov, Webster & Berezin a, 2017 ).  More specifically, service robots are used for repetitive, dirty, dull ,  and dangerous tasks such as  the  provision of information, cleaning of floors, disinfection, room service delivery, etc.  Thus, the number of studies on service robots in hospitality and tourism  industry is increasing (Ivanov, Gretzel, Berezina, Sigala & Webster, 2019;  Ivanov & Webster, 2019; Murphy, Hofacker & Gretzel, 2017; Tung & Law, 2017; Tung & Au, 2018 ;  Tussyadiah, 2020 )."
"12" "Currently ,  there is a pandemic alert around the world caused by  the  new coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The pandemic has been  severely  affecting many industries including hospitality and tourism as people must avoid human interaction.  The   World Health Organisation (2020)  advises that physical  distancing is an effective way to  slow down  the spread of a virus  because  w hen people  do not have physical contact with each other and keep distance between them,  the number of  newly  infected people decreases  significantly .  This  paper  shows that service robots may be  effectively  applied to provide physical  distancing  in  the  tourism and hospitality context."
"13" "Benefits  of robots as providers of  physically  distant services during the pandemic"
"14" "Tourism and hospitality companies can use  robots  to impose physical distancing. Room service and cleaning robots, food/parcel delivery robots, autonomous vehicles, delivery drones, and  other robots , eliminate the physical contact between tourists and employees, and the threat of infections.  The experience of the Covid-19 pandemic shows that robotic technology could be efficiently and effectively used for cleaning, disinfection, delivering food and medicines, or providing information related to the pandemic to people (Marr, 2020; Yang et al., 2020), because  robots aren’t affected by the virus  (although they can be infected by a computer virus).  For example,  in February 2020 the food delivery giant Meituan Dianping introduced robots in some of its partners ’  restaurants in Beijing that help taking food from kitchens to delivery employees and customers waiting for takeout orders (To h  & Wang, 2020).  Restaurants have limited resources for accurate and fast order  fulfilment ;  thus ,  robots are having a significant role in transferring goods from stores and warehouses to trucks and customers during the pandemic (Demaitre, 2020).  Addit i onally,  robots are being used for cleaning and food preparations ( Meisenzahl, 2020 ).   Moreover , if a guest is infected and is obliged to remain under quarantine in the room, a hotel can use robots to deliver food, linen, and other items, without risking the health and safety of the staff (Gu z zo, 2020 ;   Kent, 2020).  Covid-19  changes  the cleaning routines in hotels, and some  of them  have started to provide \"social distancing seclusion\" service to their guests  (Glusac, 2020) .   R obots are  also  beneficial during the pandemic via helping nurses to deliver food to patients. Otherwise, nurses had to wear protective suits which take at l ea st ten minutes to put on. With the robots, health risks  for  nurses  are  prevented and the y use their  time  for  more i mportant  medical treatment  tasks (Horwitz, 2020)."
"15" "Service robots  as a  technological shield between tourists and tourism employees"
"16" "Robots  provide a technological shield between tourists and tourism/hospitality employees. Tourism, being a ‘people business’, relies heavily on human employees for the service provision. Empathy, emotional intelligence, appearance, and efficiency of the service staff are important drivers of customer perceptions, service experience ,  and service quality ( Kim, Yoo, Lee & Kim,  2012; Koc ,  2019; Markovic , Raspor, Ivankovic & Planinc,  2013). Hence, the automation  and robotisation  of tourism and hospitality services may eliminate vital elements of customer experience. However, in pandemic situations, the technology shield that  robots  create can be considered is an advantage, because the physical contact is eliminated.  Of course , robots should be kept clean for avoiding infections. In this respect, tourism and hospitality businesses need to  be familiar with and adhere to the  sanitary procedures to secure guests ’ and employees’  health."
"17" "From a managerial perspective,  s ervice robots  may help to keep a high level of physical  distancing  which helps to provide a more secure service to  tourists  during a pandemic. In the post-viral world, the use of robotics may be widespread as people would  be more concerned about  their safety ;  safety and security may be  one of  the main  factors that influence tourists’ choice of a destination and particular tourism/hospitality service provider  (Hall, Scott & Gössling, 2020) .  Therefore, tourism and hospitality companies may invest in robotic technologies as one of the ways to provide a physical distancing between tourists and employees. For instance,  cleaning robots can be used to provide regular cleaning of the common areas of hotels, airports and other facilities,  room service robots can be used to  deliver food to guests’ rooms and avoid gathering of many people in hotels’ restaurants, etc. Of course, companies need to consider the legal requirements, hygienic standards and implement a detailed cost-benefit analysis whe ther  the use of service robots would be beneficial in their particular context (Ivanov & Webster, 2018).  Affordability is another issue that needs to be considered because SMEs might not have the financial resources to invest  i n service robots; for such companies renting a robot might be an appropriate solution (Ivanov & Webster, 2020)."
"18" "However,  the use of service robots  may  increase the  psychological distance between tourists and residents in  a  destination due to the decreased physical interaction between them.  For example, w hen tourists  interact  mainly with robots, they may lose human contact and social support which could cause psychological issues such as anxiety and loneliness (Tussyadiah, 2020 ) and l osing social contacts may result  in  psychological costs  for tourists  (Gupta, 2020).  On the other hand, positive host-tourist interaction may result in a positive intercultural attitude,  development of friendships, social interaction, and positive psychological change (Yilmaz & Tasci, 2015).  Therefore,  from a managerial perspective,  destinations and companies need to develop strategies to manage the interactions between hosts and tourists (Sinkovics & Penz, 2009), especially when tourists interact mainly with robots.  Thus, it is obvious that robotic technology may be beneficial in terms of  tourists’ and employees’ physical  health by increasing the  physical  distancing  during the pandemic and can prevent virus transmission, but it may be  a  disadvantage in terms of psychological health as there will be no social interaction between people.  Tourism and hospitality companies need to complement service robots with other information and communication  technolog ies ( e.g.  social media, videoconferencing  / video   chat with a human employee)  to mitigate  the negative impact of physical distancing ,   to  connect  people, and to  decreas e  the psychological distance  between them .   In other words, companies and destinations need to use technology wisely to offset the physical distancing of tourists, employees ,  and residents through their social connectedness  (Chayko, 2014; Morris et al., 2014)."
"19" "Concluding remarks"
"20" "Robots can be used effectively to provide physical distancing between host s  and guests, but they may deteriorate the psychological social distancing. They  may damage the service system in hospitality and tourism as human employees will not interact with tourists (Bowen & Morosan, 2018). This situation  may  cause the creation of a new service system  in tourism  which we name as  a  “physically and socially distant service  system ”  that relies mostly on robots and automation technologies to deliver tourist services . The current pandemic (COVID-19) may result in the transformation of some companies while others may still stick  to the current  system  and rely on  human service providers. It may be early to predict which system will  create more c ompetitive advantages in the  tourism and hospitality  industry. However, there is a need for adaptation to the new service system (physically and socially distant service) in terms of both service providers and consumers.  Future research may focus on the customers’ and employees’ perceptions of the use of robots for physical distancing and robots’ implications for service quality in hospitality."
