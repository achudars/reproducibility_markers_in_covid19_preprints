Abstract
Scientists and policy makers rely on accurate population and mortality data to
inform efforts regarding the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, with
age-specific mortality rates of high importance due to the concentration of COVID-19
deaths at older ages. Population counts – the principal denominators for calculating
age-specific mortality rates – will be subject to noise infusion in the United States
with the 2020 Census via a disclosure avoidance system based on differential privacy.
Using COVID-19 mortality curves from the CDC, we show that differential privacy
will introduce substantial distortion in COVID-19 mortality rates – sometimes causing
mortality rates to exceed 100% – hindering our ability to understand the pandemic.
This distortion is particularly large for population groupings with fewer than 1000
persons – 40% of all county-level age-sex groupings and 60% of race groupings. The
US Census Bureau should consider a larger privacy budget and data users should
consider pooling data to increase population sizes to minimize differential privacy’s
distortion.

As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) grips the world, scientists, policy makers, and journalists use population data to calculate various population-level COVID-19
rates (incidence or the new case rate, prevalence or the total case rate, and mortality) to
better understand, communicate, address, and inform mitigation efforts of the COVID-19
pandemic (Wadhera et al. 2020, Dowd et al. 2020). Because of these rate calculations, we
know that the elderly are more susceptible to COVID-19 related mortality (CDC 2020) and
that racial minorities are presently affected at higher rates (Price-Haywood et al. 2020).
Accurate COVID-19 rate calculations and estimates are thus paramount to managing this
and future pandemics. Inaccurately assessing COVID-19 could lead to misallocation of
resources and interventions to mitigate the crisis.
The calculation of any population-level COVID-19 rate is relatively straightforward –
one divides the COVID-19 counts (incidence, prevalence, and deaths) by the appropriate
population counts from Census data. To date, scientists have largely focused on properly
counting COVID-19 deaths (Banerjee et al. 2020) with a focus on the numeric amount
of cases and deaths. However, scientists and policy makers in the United States must be
mindful of population counts in the denominator of COVID-19 rate calculations due to the
implementation of differential privacy (DP) in the publication of Census 2020 counts.
The Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) to be implemented with the 2020 Census
tabulations (Mervis 2019) relies on DP, where population counts will be subject to noise
infusion in an effort to protect respondent privacy. The US Census Bureau is charged
with protecting the confidentiality of its respondents. Beginning with Census 1970, the
US Census Bureau employed a wide array of disclosure avoidance techniques to protect
respondent confidentiality. These techniques include suppression of tables with small cell
sizes, swapping or interchanging responses, and suppressing and then imputing responses
(Zayatz 2007). Starting with Census 2020, the US Census Bureau plans to “modernize” its
disclosure avoidance practices using DP (Ruggles et al. 2019). This is the first large-scale,
Census based implementation of differential privacy in the history of this methodology and
represents a monumental sea-change in population statistics (Garfinkel et al. 2018).
Under the Census Bureau’s proposed DAS using DP, population counts will be subject to noise infusion where random numerical values are added or subtracted to “true”

2

population data, drawn from a statistical distribution under a specific privacy budget –
the smaller the budget, the greater the noise. The Census Bureau then post-processes
the data to eliminate fractional and negative populations created during the DP process.
The differences between the underlying, “true” population counts in the Census Summary
File and the noise infused DAS counts could lead to substantial over/under estimation of
COVID-19 rates, dependent on the divergence between the two. The Census Bureau has
yet to finalize their DAS algorithm, though they are continually trying to improve it, and
it is unclear how similar the demonstration products are to final product. Importantly, the
Census Bureau could implement less privacy in exchange for less noise and more utility.
Scientists are only beginning to study DAS, its accuracy, and its consequences. The
extent to which DP, would distort the calculation of COVID-19 related rates is currently
untested. For the calculation of COVID-19 incidence and prevalence rates there will be no
alternative to differentially private Census 2020 data. Given how crucial population counts
are for the evaluation and tracking of epidemiological rates, noise-infused population counts
could lead to erroneous COVID-19 rate calculations and harm our ability to understand the
current pandemic and manage future public health crises. Accurate population counts are
just as important as accurate COVID-19 related counts and after the release of Census 2020
data we fear DP will render most COVID-19 rates confused at best and highly inaccurate
at worst.
To demonstrate the extent to which differential privacy could distort COVID-19 rates by
age-sex and by race, we combine the most recent US Census Bureau’s DAS demonstration
products segmented by age and sex (Van Riper et al. 2020) with empirical COVID-19 age
and sex mortality curves from the CDC (CDC 2020) and a hypothetical 70% infection rate,
constituting the theoretical herd immunity for the US (Kwok et al. 2020). This allows for a
simulation of the difference between hypothetical mortality rate calculations using counts
produced with DAS from population counts produced using current methods. Though we
use mortality rates, COVID-19 incidence and prevalence would be identical in both bias
and in their rate calculation.
Figure 1a shows the distortion of COVID-19 age-sex specific mortality rates by population size for US counties using the 2010 demonstration products. We find that smaller

drop precipitously with at least 1000 persons.

age-sex populations have much higher absolute errors than larger populations. These errors are not limited to small areas or a single age group, rather these errors are present
in all age groups. Additionally, using DAS as the denominator causes some age-specific
mortality rates to rarely, but impossibly exceed 100% (red dots). For example, Census
2010’s Kent County Texas contained 58 women aged 85+ but the DP count is 2. If the
COVID-19 incidence, prevalence, or fatality, exceeds 2 individuals in this age-sex group, the
COVID-19 calculated rate would impossibly exceed 100%. It is particularly worrisome that
age-sex groups with fewer than 1000 persons – more than 40% of all county-level age-sex
groupings in the US – exhibit particularly large errors making any meaningful COVID-19
rate calculation difficult to interpret for large segments of the country.
DAS distorts general mortality rates for racial/ethnic minorities (Santos-Lozada et al.
2020) and Figure 1b shows the distortion of COVID-19 race-specific mortality rates by
population size for US counties. Much like with age-sex specific mortality, error increases
substantially as population size decreases for all race groups. Only White, Non-Hispanic
exhibit the lowest error; all other race groups – including pooling all non-white groups
together – exhibit large errors as population size decreases. Race-groups with fewer than
1000 persons – more than 60% of all county-race groups – exhibit the largest errors.
BALANCING DATA PRIVACY AND UTILITY
We highlight how the planned, 2020 U.S. Census data under DP will significantly alter our understanding of COVID-19 via noise-infused population counts. Using empirical
age-sex specific COVID-19 mortality curves from the CDC, we show that DAS will introduce substantial errors in COVID-19 expected age-sex specific mortality rates – sometimes
causing age-specific mortality rates to exceed 100% - hindering our ability to understand
the pandemic. These errors are particularly large for approximately 40% of county age-sex
groupings and 60% of county-race groupings containing fewer than 1000 persons. Overall, differential privacy will introduce significant challenges in our understanding of the
COVID-19 global pandemic expected to last well into 2021 or beyond.
How are we to understand this pandemic if the very foundation upon which we calculate
the most basic rates contains significant distortion? How will cities, states, and the federal
government effectively manage the current or future pandemics if crucial denominators

minority populations – are the very groups COVID-19 harms the most and in need of the
most targeted interventions. If we cannot parse out the noise from the true values, we
are left with a muddied vision of the pandemic and our responses will further reflect that
uncertainty. To provide some guidance, we offer recommendations for the Census Bureau
and those calculating COVID-19 rates.
The Census Bureau is still fine tuning their DAS algorithm and has previously expressed
concern about the tradeoff between privacy and utility (Abowd & Schmutte 2019). A second
run of the DAS algorithm dealt with numerous concerns of the data user community (US
Census Bureau 2020), yet its utility still needs assessment. Census data are foundational
to many kinds of analyses – some analyses the Census Bureau probably never envisioned
– and unfortunately the COVID-19 pandemic arose in the midst the Census Bureau’s
privacy changes. Because the Census Bureau DAS demonstration products are so new,
deep analysis of the impact these changes will have on the utility of public health data are
yet to be determined. As we show, the DP algorithm, as proposed, sacrifices the usefulness
of basic COVID-19 calculations in many counties and population groups.
There is still time for the Census Bureau to continue refining their DP algorithm or
improve the privacy budget to allow more stable estimates in more population groups.
The first Census 2020 data products were originally slated for release in December 2020
but with the updated Census 2020 timeline, the first products should be released by April
2021. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lags health and mortality data
making detailed COVID-related analyses very likely reliant on Census 2020 noise-infused
population counts rather than population counts produced using traditional methods. If
the DAS algorithm continues to produce distorted COVID-19 rates, data users might turn
to outdated population estimates released prior to DAS in their COVID-19 calculations.
The US Census Bureau should consider alternative datasets specifically tailored for
COVID-19 analyses, alternative disclosure avoidance systems, or a larger privacy budget
during this historical pandemic. It is entirely possible that future scientists of the next
major pandemic will turn to the remnants of the COVID-19 data to understand their
own pandemic – data that DP will certainly distort. The decisions the Census Bureau

7

makes now will have long-term repercussions for what we can learn about COVID-19.
Scientists, policymakers, and journalists turn toward the last major global pandemic – the
1918 Spanish Flu – to draw important parallels from the historical clues left behind in
pictures, newspapers, and scientific articles. Those parallels play a powerful role in shaping
public discourse, even with their historical patina. When we look back on COVID-19
during the next major global pandemic, any statistical measures arising from the United
States will be far less meaningful due to the infusion of noise in the very building blocks of
COVID-19 rates.
When, and not if, the Census Bureau releases DP data, the breadth of data users
analyzing COVID-19 need to be aware of these limitations in using DP data for COVID19 analyses. Based on our findings, we offer three recommendations to scientists and
policy makers. First, we suggest a minimum cell size of 1000 persons for the calculation
of any COVID-19 rates (incidence, prevalence, and mortality). The distortion in COVID19 rates rapidly shrinks as population sizes increase, especially in sizes larger than 1000
persons. Second, scientists and policymakers can combine areas to create larger cell sizes
via regions, sacrificing geographic detail for population specificity. The Census Bureau
uses this approach for their public use microdata samples (PUMS), and we recommend
a similar approach for COVID-19 analyses. Third, scientists can pool data together in
either wider age intervals (ie 20-year age intervals rather than 10-year age intervals) or
wider race classifications (ie using the Office of Management and Budget’s minimum race
classifications rather than the fully detailed 9 race classification). These strategies, either
in isolation or in combination, will minimize the distortion in COVID-19 rate calculations.
The Census Bureau’s demonstration product presently contains only age-sex-county and
race-county breakdowns and does not contain age-sex-race-county. Yet race differentials
in COVID-19 mortality are an important aspect of the pandemic (Hooper et al. 2020).
The potential errors in COVID-19 mortality by age and sex are already significantly large
and we believe analyzing COVID-19 mortality by age-sex-race would further reduce cell
sizes, ensuring an even greater number of combinations with fewer than 1000 persons – the
identified threshold with the largest errors.
As the pandemic continues, scientists, policy makers, and journalists should embrace

8

minimum standards for COVID-19 analyses using Census 2020 and subsequent data products. Future analyses should be, at minimum, informed of the issues of using noise-infused
population counts and should employ strategies outlined above to ensure analyses accurately reflect their chosen measurement and the social phenomenon of interest.
Materials and Methods. We utilize two primary sources of data in our estimates
concerning the denominators for COVID-19 rate calculations and one primary source of
data concerning the numerators. For the denominators, we use the 2010 county-level population estimates from traditional disclosure avoidance techniques and 2010 county-level
population estimates produced with the proposed differential privacy 2010 demonstration
product (Van Riper et al. 2020) from May 27 2020 – the most recent file with age*sex detail.
We accessed county-level population counts in 10-year age groups by sex and county-level
population counts by race/ethnicity. The 2010 demonstration product simulates the DP
algorithm on Census 2010 Summary File 1 to provide a comparison between traditional disclosure avoidance counts and the new DP counts. The DP Demonstration product provides
the denominators for calculating the COVID-19 mortality rates but not the numerators.
To calculate the number of anticipated COVID-19 deaths by age/sex, we apply empirical age/sex mortality rates from the CDC (CDC 2020) to the 2010 Census Bureau
Summary File 1 data (SF) that are not produced using DP and assume a 70% infection
rate before herd immunity halts the spread (Kwok et al. 2020). This allows us to estimate
the anticipated mortality for the underlying, “true” population (Di,a,s,SF ) by county i, age
group a, and sex group s. COVID-19 mortality rates are simply calculated as the numeric
deaths divided by the population. We calculate the mortality rate under an SF and a DP
denominator such that mi,a,s = Di,a,s,SF /Pi,a,s,c where Pi,a,s,c refers to the relevant population and c refers to either SF or DP. For our race analysis, we apply empirical mortality
rates from the CDC to each race group r in each county i and a 70% infection rate to
estimate the COVID-19 mortality rates under SF and DP (mi,r = Di,r,SF /Pi,r, ). We then
calculate a mortality rate ratio (MRR), expressed as the ratio of the DP to SF mortality
rates (MDP /MSF − 1), where values above 1.0 represent DP mortality rate which exceeds
the SF mortality rate.
