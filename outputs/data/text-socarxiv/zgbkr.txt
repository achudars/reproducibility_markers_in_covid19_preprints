Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession:
Policy Recommendations for COVID-19

William J. Scarborough,1 Caitlyn Collins,2 Leah Ruppanner,3 and Liana Christin Landivar4
Abstract
Objective: This article examines whether the availability of Head Start during the Great
Recession mitigated the impact of this crisis on poverty rates among families with young
children.
Background: The first two decades of the 21st century have witnessed two major economic
crises: the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic. Poverty rates among families with
young children grew substantially during the Great Recession. Families with young children are
also more vulnerable to instability during the COVID-19 pandemic as job losses have been
steeper and childcare availability has been significantly curtailed. Programs like Head Start that
support at-risk families may mitigate such negative consequences.
Method: This study uses data from the American Community Survey from 2006 through 2016
and state-level data on Head Start availability from Program Information Reports. Growth curve
modeling is used to examine how the availability of Head Start predicted poverty growth during
the Great Recession and the speed of recovery post-recession.
Results: States with higher rates of Head Start enrollment had a smaller increase in family
poverty during the Great Recession and a more stable recovery than states with lower Head Start
enrollment.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that greater access to Head Start programs prevented many
families from falling into poverty and helped others exit poverty during the Great Recession.
Implications: The findings provide clear, evidence-based policy recommendations. Increased
federal funding for Head Start is needed to support families during a COVID-19 recession. States
should supplement these allocations to expand Head Start enrollment for all eligible families.

Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession: Policy Recommendations
for COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest challenge the world has faced this millennium. Millions
have been infected with the virus and hundreds of thousands have died (World Health
Organization, 2020). Beyond these unprecedented health consequences, the pandemic has
upended national economies and dramatically impacted daily life. In the U.S., high rates of virus
transmission have coincided with one of the fastest and most severe economic downturns in
history as businesses closed or reduced operations across the country. In a period of only three
weeks from March to April, 2020, over 16 million people filed unemployment insurance claims,
more than double the number of claims made during the peak two years of the Great Recession
of 2007-2009 (Cohen & Hsu, 2020). Recent trends have shown sustained levels of high
unemployment well into the third quarter of 2020, with many projections forecasting the onset of
a long-lasting global recession (Fernandes, 2020; McKibbin & Fernando, 2020). Not only are
many families facing extreme economic precarity, but school and childcare closings during the
pandemic have removed major sources of support on which families rely. These challenging
conditions require effective policy solutions to support families and advance economic recovery
following the pandemic.
In this study, we contribute evidence-based policy recommendations to support families
during and after the COVID-19 related recession. To do this, we seek lessons from the last
economic recession to examine how variation between states in families’ access to Head Start
was associated with economic recovery following the 2007-2009 Great Recession. Head Start is
a means-tested school readiness program that offers free childcare and comprehensive family
support services for eligible children in families with incomes below established thresholds. In
times of economic recession, programs like Head Start may provide a vital resource for families

Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession
who lack childcare support as they seek employment or return to work. Yet, the availability of
Head Start varies widely depending on families’ state of residence. Community agencies have
discretion in allocating federal funds and state governments may supplement funding to expand
Head Start availability and services (Barnett & Friedman-Krauss, 2016). Consequently, there are
stark differences in rates of Head Start enrollment between states. Leveraging this variation, we
illustrate the value of this federal program by showing that family poverty rates increased less
and recovered faster in states with higher Head Start enrollment during the 2007-2009 recession.
Our results provide empirical evidence that Head Start can play a vital role in keeping
families afloat during periods of economic crisis. As we face new challenges stemming from the
COVID-19 pandemic, we urge policymakers to heed this evidence and designate funding to
expand Head Start. The program has established processes and infrastructure making it suitable
for expansion through federal, state, and community funding. Our findings suggest that increased
Head Start funding will hasten post-pandemic economic recovery as it did when Head Start
funding was increased under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act during the last
recession in 2009 (Office of Head Start 2010). As more families become economically
vulnerable and childcare centers close, we provide evidence from the Great Recession to show
that ensuring Head Start spaces for all eligible children and broadening eligibility guidelines will
play a key role in keeping vulnerable families out of poverty.
CHILDCARE AND FAMILY SUPPORT IN THE UNITED STATES
The U.S. government plays a much smaller role in childcare provision than in many European
nations (Collins, 2019). In the absence of public support, most families must turn to the market,
relatives, friends, and sometimes all three to provide care. Others reduce their employment or
leave the labor force when faced with expensive childcare costs before children start public

Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession
school at ages five or six (Ruppanner, Moller, & Sayer, 2019). Labor force exits due to childcare
are more common among mothers than fathers because they remain primarily responsible for the
care of children (Scarborough, Sin, & Risman, 2019). Recent research shows this is particularly
true during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the increased caregiving demands associated with
childcare center closures and homeschooling has led to mothers exiting the labor force at a rate
three times that of fathers (Heggeness and Fields, 2020; see also Landivar et al., 2020). This
places working- and middle-class families in a double bind. Wage stagnation since the 1970s has
meant that two incomes are increasingly necessary to fulfill the rising cost of basic needs
(Wilmers, 2018), but expensive and difficult to access childcare means that many families must
choose between taking on a major monthly expense or substantially reducing their household
income as one parent, usually the mother, stays home to provide care from birth to school age
(Landivar, 2017; Ruppanner, 2020). Single-parent families are especially susceptible to poverty
given these demands (Misra, Moller, & Budig, 2007), which explains their overrepresentation
below the poverty line (U.S. Census Bureau, 2018).
Although the U.S. lacks a comprehensive public childcare system, some programs do
exist to support eligible families. These include Child Care and Development Block Grants
(CCDBG) childcare subsidies, state-funded pre-kindergarten programs, and Head Start. CCDBG
subsidies provide financial support for low-income families to pay for childcare in order to
increase children’s school readiness and allow parents to work or advance their educational and
training qualifications. However, less than a quarter of eligible families receive subsidies
(Government Accountability Office, 2019), and these provisions rarely cover all childcare
expenses: the average co-payment for subsidy recipients is 7% of family income (U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, 2019). State-funded pre-K programs are more

Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession
accessible, but still enroll only about a third of four-year-olds and less than 10% of three-yearolds (Friedman-Krauss et al., 2020). Unlike CCDBG subsidies or Head Start, pre-K funding is
not tied to sustaining federal sources. Consequently, 19 U.S. states currently offer no statefunded pre-K programs.
Although CCDBG subsidies and state-funded pre-K provide major support to families,
we focus on Head Start as the oldest and largest federally funded early childhood development
program. Head Start is a categorical grant program administered by the Office of Head Start in
the Department of Health and Human Services. Federal grants, sometimes combined with
supplemental state funding, are allocated to local agencies administering Head Start programs in
each state. Head Start programs serve children under the age of three through Early Head Start,
and preschool centers focus on children ages three and four. Enrollment is free for eligible
children who must be ages five or under, live in a family with income below the poverty line,
receive other types of income-based public assistance, be homeless, or be in foster care
(Hofferth, 1994; Office of Head Start, 2019). Head Start focuses on school readiness, but it also
provides a range of other family support services related to housing, health and wellbeing,
financial security, and continuing education (Office of Head Start, 2019). As a result, Head Start
offers a more comprehensive system of support for families in need than CCDBG subsidies or
pre-K programs. Annually serving nearly one million children, Head Start operates in all 50
states and the District of Columbia (Barnett & Friedman-Krauss, 2016). With an established
infrastructure, a holistic focus on families experiencing economic hardship, and regular budget
allocation from Congress, Head Start constitutes a potentially effective program to support
families through periods of economic recession.

Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession
Despite being the largest federally funded childhood development program, Head Start
funding is not highly responsive to changes in demand. Consequently, a significant share of
eligible families remain without a slot due to limited funding. Nationally, this means only 9% of
three-year-olds and 12% of four-year-olds—or about 40% of all preschoolers living in families
below the poverty line—are enrolled in Head Start (Chaudry et al., 2017). Of course, families
who cannot access Head Start for childcare likely turn to alternative options from friends, family
and the market. Federal funding for Head Start remains well below the established demand for
these programs. Head Start funding is allocated federally, but states can bolster these funds and
community agencies have significant discretion in how they are used. Different states give
primacy to enrollment, teacher salaries, or curricula. As a result, Head Start enrollment varies
dramatically across states (Barnett & Friedman-Krauss, 2016). In North Dakota, for example,
100% of eligible families are enrolled in Head Start, whereas only 22% are enrolled in Nevada
(see Figure 1). Variation in the availability of Head Start means that eligible families face
different institutional constraints in accessing this federal provision depending on where they
live. Families in places like Ohio (55% of eligible families enrolled) have far more access to free
childcare through Head Start than those living in neighboring Indiana (34%).

These differences may be particularly consequential during times of economic recession.
We conceptualize these relationships through a capabilities perspective, which posits that
institutional constraints limit an individual’s autonomy and self-actualization (Sen, 1993; see
also Hobson 2018). By theorizing individuals as embedded in institutional structures that both
constrain and create opportunities (capabilities), we can understand larger demographic patterns
including, here, how state-to-state differences in access to Head Start may structure family
poverty and economic recovery. Head Start is meant to improve capability by equalizing access
to high-quality childcare to improve school readiness and close income-based educational gaps.
However, current provisions are insufficient to meet demand, leading to variation in spaces
across states. In states with few available openings for Head Start enrollment, parents who
experience job loss may need to stay home to provide childcare—a diminished capability

Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession
bounded by an institutional constraint. This poses challenges for those seeking new employment
and pushes vulnerable families further into poverty.
Those who lose their jobs may not only fall into poverty during recession periods but, in
the absence of childcare supports, they may remain in poverty longer than those living in states
where Head Start is more readily available. Consequently, states with lower enrollment in Head
Start may experience longer and more sustained economic recessions. By contrast, states with
more accessible Head Start programs may see quicker rebounds out of poverty for vulnerable
families, which we conceptualize as a capabilities-enhancing institutional context for parents.
Parents in states where eligible children may be readily enrolled in Head Start have more
opportunity to obtain employment and will be less likely to be priced out of work as a result of
expensive childcare. They are also less likely to leave a job due to childcare problems—a
common cause of labor force exits (Mathur & McCloskey, 2014). Beyond childcare and
childhood development, these families also receive other services through Head Start programs
that support housing stability, children’s health and wellbeing, parents’ continuing education,
and financial security. Considering these benefits, we theorize Head Start as a central
institutional mechanism to alleviate challenges facing working families and, by extension, state
economies.
HEAD START AND ECONOMIC WELLBEING: EVIDENCE FROM THE GREAT RECESSION
To test capabilities arguments that programs such as Head Start may support families’ recovery
from economic hardship, we explore the relationship between Head Start availability and rates of
family poverty from 2006 through 2016 which captures the period before, during, and after the
2007-2009 Great Recession. Unlike CCDBG subsidies and state-funded pre-K programs, Head
Start programs offer additional services to support families in poverty and are, therefore, more

Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession
directly suited to address the challenges families face during periods of economic downturn. We
also focus on Head Start because it is the longest running federal program for early childhood
development and thus has existing infrastructure for expansion. Indeed, the federal government
provided an additional $2.1 billion in federal funding through the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 to increase Head Start enrollment during the Great Recession (Office
of Head Start, 2010). Thus, there is precedent for expanding federal funding and enrollment in
Head Start during times of economic uncertainty. We explore whether Head Start was effective
in buffering families from poverty by examining whether variation in its availability between
states predicted growth in family poverty during the Great Recession as well as changes in rates
of family poverty during the post-recession recovery years.
Our study speaks to a core theoretical argument from the capabilities perspective:
governments are integral in alleviating institutional barriers to individual capabilities. Here, we
argue that access to Head Start programs are integral to helping families out of poverty and, as a
result, accelerating economic recovery from periods of recession. We investigate one central
research question: Did the state-level availability of Head Start at the height of the last economic
recession influence both the rise of family poverty during the recession and its decline in the
post-recession recovery years?
Our expected relationships are hypothesized below:
Poverty Vulnerability:
H1: States with a higher percentage of eligible children enrolled in Head Start will have less
poverty growth during the Great Recession than states where Head Start was less accessible.
Economic Recovery

Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession
H2: States with a higher percentage of eligible children enrolled in Head Start will have quicker
economic recoveries following the Great Recession than states where Head Start was less
accessible.
METHOD
Data
We use data from the American Community Survey (ACS) for years 2006 through 2016
(Ruggles et al., 2020), spanning the period of time before, during, and after the Great Recession.
The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the ongoing ACS and currently collects socio-demographic
information from approximately 3.5 million households annually (U.S. Census Bureau, 2020). It
is the single most comprehensive source of information on the U.S. population. These data
provide adequate sampling of the U.S. to support robust state-to-state comparisons for detailed
groups. In the absence of an existing dataset of families enrolled in Head Start over an extended
period of time and across all U.S. states, the ACS constitutes the highest quality data to address
our research questions. Here, we include families with children under age five because they are
in most need of childcare and development support. This resulted in a sample of 1,540,486
families across 50 states and Washington, D.C. (between 132,000 and 146,000 families per
year). With this sample of families, we constructed a panel of state-years which we used to
analyze the relationship between state-level Head Start enrollment and poverty rates for families
with young children. Our data consist of 51 states (including Washington, D.C.) across 11 years
for a total sample of 561 state-years.
Analytic Approach
We use growth-curve models to examine how changes in the poverty rate for families with
young children from 2006 through 2016 vary between states as a function of Head Start

Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession
enrollment. Growth-curves are ideal for testing the effects of state-level childcare support on
long-term rates of family poverty because this approach specifically focuses on differences
between units in trajectories of change over time, here, changes in the trajectory of family
poverty rates (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). In our application, we predict the state-year poverty
rate for families with young children using a regression model that allows trends to vary by state:
𝑦𝑡𝑠 = 𝛽1 + 𝛽2 𝑤𝑡𝑠 + 𝛽3 𝑤 2 𝑡𝑠 + 𝛾1𝑠 + 𝛾2𝑠 𝑤𝑡𝑠 + 𝛾3𝑠 𝑤 2 𝑡𝑠 + 𝜀𝑡𝑠
(1)

Here, 𝑦𝑡𝑠 is the state-year percentage of families with young children whose total income in the
survey year is below the federal poverty line, as determined by the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services (2020). This outcome is modeled as a function of yearly change from 2006
through 2016, 𝑤𝑡𝑠 , and year-squared, 𝑤 2 𝑡𝑠 to account for non-linearity in these patterns.
Together, these terms describe the rise in family poverty during the recession (𝑤𝑡𝑠 ) and its
subsequent decline during the period of post-recession economic recovery (𝑤 2 𝑡𝑠 ). Capturing
between-state differences, 𝛾1𝑠 represents state-variation in the intercept predicting baseline
differences between states in family poverty rates. Differences in trajectories are represented by
𝛾2𝑠 and 𝛾3𝑠 which predict state-variation in poverty trends over time. By specifying trend
coefficients to vary, we focus our attention on differences between states in the extent that family
poverty rates changed between 2006 and 2016.
To test our hypothesis related to the protective effects of Head Start, we added an
interaction between the trend terms in Equation 1 and a variable measuring the percentage of
eligible children enrolled in Head Start around the height of the recession in 2009.
𝑦𝑡𝑠 = 𝛽1 + 𝛽2 𝑤𝑡𝑠 + 𝛽3 𝑤 2 𝑡𝑠 + 𝛽4 𝐻𝑠 + 𝛽5 𝐻𝑠 𝑤𝑡𝑠 + 𝛽6 𝐻𝑠 𝑤 2 𝑡𝑠 + 𝛾1𝑠 + 𝛾2𝑠 𝑤𝑡𝑠 + 𝛾3𝑠 𝑤 2 𝑡𝑠 + 𝜀𝑡𝑠
(2)

Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession
H𝑠 measures the percentage of eligible three- and four-year-olds enrolled in Head Start for each
state averaged between 2009 and 2011. Data for this measure are from the Head Start Program
Information Reports compiled by diversitydatakids.org at the Heller School for Social Policy and
Management at Brandeis University. We focus on Head Start enrollment during the years 2009
through 2011 because most recession indicators reached their peak in these years.
Unemployment, for example, peaked at 10% in October 2009 and remained above 9% through
September of 2011 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020a). Examining the role of Head Start
enrollment during these years allows us to specifically examine whether this family support
program mitigated against an increase in poverty. Interacting Head Start availability with both
year and year-squared, we are able to test whether levels of Head Start enrollment were
associated with slower growth in family poverty rates during the recession (year, 𝛽5 𝐻𝑠 𝑤𝑡𝑠 ), as
well as its relationship to rates of recovery post-recession (year-squared, 𝐻𝑠 𝑤 2 𝑡𝑠 ).
We also include a number of control variables in our models. First, to account for
additional programs serving families’ childcare needs, we control for the percentage of eligible
families receiving CCDBG subsidies and the percentage of three- and four-year-olds enrolled in
state-funded pre-K. We use average rates of subsidy receipt and pre-K enrollment from 2009
through 2011 to correspond to our measure of Head Start enrollment and account for potential
spuriousness. Data on subsidy receipt were obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services (2014) and data on pre-K enrollment come from the National Institute for Early
Education Research (Barnett et al., 2011). Interactions between these two covariates with year
and year-squared were conducted, but are not included in our results because they were nonsignificant and did not alter substantive findings related to our hypotheses. Controlling for
variation in the degree to which states were affected by the recession, our models also include

Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession
controls for baseline rates of unemployment in 2006 as well as change in unemployment rates
from the beginning of the recession in 2007 to the end in 2009. Four additional covariates
account for state socioeconomic characteristics. The share of workers employed in
manufacturing, one of the hardest-hit industries in the recession, is used to control for industry
conditions within each state across years of data. Immigrant density is measured as the
percentage of the state population that is foreign born. Racial composition is measured as the
percentage of residents who are white. And average levels of human capital are controlled for
with the share of state residents with a college degree.
Although Equations 1 and 2 include varying intercepts and slopes that account for some
unobserved heterogeneity between states, the effects of Head Start on poverty trajectories could
be confounded by additional, unobserved state-level characteristics. To account for this, we
apply Equation 2 to a counterfactual sample of families without young children (n=18,896,158).
Although Head Start may indirectly benefit families without young children through supporting
state economies as a whole, the effects should be less pronounced for these families than those
with young children who more directly benefit from Head Start childcare provisions. Testing for
these differences allows us to identify whether the observed relationship between Head Start and
poverty trajectories are spurious, since unobserved confounders would apply equally to families
with young children and those without, whereas the primary mechanism of childcare and child
development provisions provided by Head Start should be felt the most among families with
young children.
We present our results in two sections. First, we report descriptive trends in Head Start
enrollment and state-level poverty rates for families with young children from 2006 through

Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession
2016. Second, we present the results of our growth curve models designed to test the relationship
of Head Start enrollment to changes in family poverty rates.
RESULTS
Descriptives
Family poverty rates rose during and immediately following the recession. National trends
illustrated in Figure 2a indicate that about 21% of families with young children were living
below the federal poverty line in 2006. In 2009, this number increased to 23.4%, and continued
to grow until 2011 when it peaked at 25.6% where it remained through 2012. At its worst, over
one-quarter of U.S. families with young children were living in poverty. Since 2012, however,
there has been a steady decline in the rate of poverty for families with young children. By 2016,
21.5% of families were in poverty, slightly higher than the pre-recession share.
National trends in rates of family poverty remain consistent when using a higher poverty
threshold: families living below 150% of the federal poverty line (Figure 2b). Again, there was
an increase in families living in or on the brink of poverty during the recession years, continuing
through 2011 and 2012 when nearly 38% of families with young children were living below
150% of the poverty threshold. Following 2012, the share of families living below 150% of the
poverty line fell through 2016. Henceforth, we direct our focus to the rate of families living
below the poverty line, but all analyses were also conducted using a threshold of 150% of the
poverty line and substantive findings remain consistent.

Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession
Changes in family poverty rates from 2006 through 2016 varied widely between states.
As illustrated in Figure 3, nearly all states experienced an increase in family poverty during the
recession years. However, the extent of that increase, and the rate of subsequent recovery,
differed from state to state. Oklahoma, for example, had a slight increase in family poverty
followed by a precipitous decline. Nevada, in contrast, had a major increase in family poverty
during the recession—a change that it had yet to fully recover from in 2016, when family
poverty rates remained higher than they were in pre-recession years. Colorado, meanwhile,
witnessed growth in family poverty during the recession, but by 2016 it had lower rates of
poverty than it had in 2006.
Descriptive trends illustrated in Figures 2 and 3 highlight both the tremendous
consequences of the Great Recession on family poverty and the variation in these effects across
states. Considering the role that childcare support plays in families’ economic participation and
the variation in the extent to which programs like Head Start are available across states, it is
possible that the accessibility of Head Start during the recession years played a role in shaping
how severely the recession impacted rates of family poverty. To test this relationship, we now
turn to the results of the growth curve models.

Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession
Head Start Enrollment and Family Poverty Trends
Table 1 reports the results of four models examining baseline trajectories of family poverty
across states (Model 1), main effects of Head Start availability during years of peak economic
hardship from 2009 through 2011 (Model 2), whether state trajectories in rates of family poverty
were conditional upon Head Start enrollment (Model 3), and a counterfactual model using a
sample of families without young children (Model 4). Focusing first on the baseline model, we
find that the trend effects represented by the positive coefficient for year and the negative
coefficient for year-squared capture an upside-down U-shaped trajectory of growing rates of
family poverty through the recession (year, p < .001) followed by declines in the post-recession
years of economic recovery (year-squared, p < .001). Among covariates, we find that the
percentage of eligible families receiving CCDBG subsidies is unrelated to levels of family
poverty, while greater state-funded pre-K enrollment is associated with higher levels of state
poverty (p < .01). This likely reflects the limited coverage of CCDBG subsidies and the tendency
for states with higher rates of poverty to fund pre-K programs. Model 1 also reports that states
with high unemployment prior to the recession in 2006 had higher rates of family poverty (p <
.05). Severity of the recession, measured through the rise of unemployment between 2007 and
2009, was a non-significant predictor of family poverty after accounting for covariates. Two
socio-demographic characteristics, the share of states’ population that are foreign-born (p < .01)
and college-educated (p < .001), were associated with lower rates of family poverty. These
relationships are consistent with research showing that immigration and human capital are a
boon to local economies (Agera & Brückner, 2013; Krueger & Lindahl, 2001). States’ racial
composition and the size of manufacturing sectors were unrelated to rates of family poverty.

Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession
The second model in Table 1 adds the percentage of three- and four-year olds enrolled in
Head Start from 2009 through 2011. The main effects presented in Model 2 examine whether
Head Start accessibility is associated with overall levels of family poverty, but they do not
provide insight on whether Head Start influences change in poverty rates over time (tested in
Model 3). The main effects of Head Start accessibility are non-significant. Consistent with
previous research (Chaudry et al., 2017), this indicates that Head Start does not scale up to meet
changes in the number of eligible families who live in poverty, leaving many families
underserved. Yet, the third model in Table 1 shows that Head Start enrollment has significant
effects on how poverty rates changed from 2006 through 2016. The negative coefficient for the
interaction of Head Start availability and year (p < .001) indicates that states with a higher
percentage of eligible children enrolled in Head Start experienced less growth in family poverty
during and immediately following the recession, lending support for our first hypothesis. Head
Start also moderated year-squared (p < .01), such that states with greater availability of Head
Start were more resilient to major fluctuations in rates of family poverty. In other words, states
where Head Start was more accessible had flatter curves (smaller recession-related increases in
family poverty).
The last model presented in Table 1 uses a counterfactual sample of families without
young children as a robustness test of our key findings. Model 4 provides results for the
counterfactual sample and the last column in Table 1 reports whether coefficients in Model 3
(focal sample of families with young children) and Model 4 (counterfactual sample of families
without young children) are significantly different. The counterfactual model substantiates our
key findings. The significant difference between Models 3 and 4 for the interaction of year and
Head Start accessibility indicates that Head Start had a larger mitigating effect against poverty

Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession
growth for families with young children than those without young children. Although Head Start
slowed poverty growth for all families (p < .001), its effect was significantly stronger for those
who stood to benefit directly from the program. These patterns are consistent with previous
research showing that social policies to improve parental wellbeing also improve wellbeing
among the general population, if only to a smaller extent compared to those with children
(Flavin, Pacek, & Radcliff, 2014; Glass, Simon, & Andersson, 2016). Our findings suggest that
by directly serving vulnerable families to mitigate against poverty, Head Start also enhances
states’ economic stability more generally.
Visualizing the Effect of Head Start Enrollment on Family Poverty
Overall, our results reported in Table 1 show that states with higher levels of Head Start
enrollment experienced less poverty growth among families with young children during the
Great Recession. These trends are illustrated in Figure 4 that shows predicted rates of family
poverty from 2006 through 2016 for states where 20%, 60%, and 100% of eligible children were
enrolled in Head Start, calculated from Model 3. These percentages capture approximate data
points in our sample. For example, Nevada has 22%, Illinois 60%, and North Dakota 100% of all
eligible children enrolled in their Head Start programs. Despite starting out with higher rates of
poverty among families with young children in 2006, states with higher Head Start enrollment of
eligible children did not experience as rapid an increase in family poverty up to 2012. In fact, by
2009 there was practically no difference in family poverty rates between high-, medium-, and
low- Head Start enrollment states, but by 2012, states with low Head Start enrollment (20% of
eligible enrolled) had family poverty rates nearly one percentage point higher than states where
enrollment was at 60%, and nearly two percentage points higher than states with 100% of
eligible children enrolled in Head Start. Although family poverty declined across all states during

Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession
the post-recession period, by 2016 low Head Start enrollment states were still predicted to have
higher levels of family poverty than high-enrollment states—a change from 2009 when rates of
family poverty did not stratify by Head Start enrollment. This means Head Start enrollment
played a key role in states’ recoveries post-recession, providing clear evidence for its importance
in dealing with the economic fallout resulting from COVID-19 and lending support for our
second hypothesis.

FIGURE 4. PREDICTED FAMILY POVERTY RATES BY HEAD START AVAILABILITY

Note: Shaded area represents recession period from December 2007 through June 2009.

Figure 5 plots family poverty rates by year for two illustrative pairs of states to provide
comparative cases that highlight the overall trends displayed in Table 1 and Figure 4. State pairs
were selected for similarity in initial or post-recession economic conditions, size, and proximity.
The first set, Alabama and Mississippi (5a), are bordering states in the South where poverty rates
are among the highest in the nation. Both states have low pre-K and CCDBG enrollment, but
Head Start enrollment was almost twice as high in Mississippi (90% of eligible enrolled) as
Alabama (47%) from 2009 to 2011. These differences in Head Start enrollment coincided with

Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession
distinct trends in the family poverty rate between 2006 and 2016. Prior to the recession, the rate
of family poverty was about six percentage points higher in Mississippi than Alabama. By the
end of the recession, this gap had fallen to 3.5 percentage points, as family poverty in Alabama
rose at a faster rate than in Mississippi. Additionally, while rates of family poverty in Mississippi
began to decline after 2011, they continued to rise in Alabama for an additional two years until
peaking in 2013. Both Alabama and Mississippi had major declines in family poverty after 2013,
but the trend was steeper in Mississippi, resulting in these two states having nearly the same
family poverty rate by 2016. In light of the findings from Table 1, there is strong evidence that
convergence in rates of family poverty between Mississippi and Alabama are due in part to the
greater availability of Head Start in Mississippi during the years of 2009 through 2011 when
many families faced severe economic consequences from the Great Recession.

Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession
Whereas Alabama and Mississippi converged in family poverty rates, we observed
divergence between Arkansas and Oklahoma (Figure 5b). These bordering states are similar in
size and economic conditions. Oklahoma, however, has one of the most comprehensive
preschool programs in the nation, with 66% of eligible children enrolled in Head Start and over
70% of four-year-olds enrolled in state-funded pre-K programs (pre-K is not offered for threeyear-olds in Oklahoma). Arkansas, in comparison, enrolled 46% of those eligible in Head Start
and around 40% of four-year-olds and 10% of three-year-olds in state-funded pre-K. As
illustrated in Figure 5b, Oklahoma’s robust childcare infrastructure appears to have mitigated
against the worst consequences of the Great Recession, which had a greater impact in
neighboring Arkansas. Prior to the recession, family poverty rates were similar in Arkansas
(28.5%) and Oklahoma (27.7%). The recession years contributed to an increase in family poverty
in both states, but this growth was much more pronounced in Arkansas, where family poverty
rose 2.5 percentage points from 2007 to 2011, compared to 1.3 percentage points during this
same period in Oklahoma. While rates of family poverty began to decline steadily in Oklahoma
following 2012, this downward trend did not start until a year later in Arkansas and was less
pronounced. As a result, family poverty rates in 2016 were over four percentage points lower in
Oklahoma than in Arkansas, despite these states having similar rates in 2006. While Oklahoma’s
extensive state-funded pre-K programs may have provided further support to families, findings
from our growth curve models (Table 1), which controlled for pre-K enrollment, suggest that
highly accessible Head Start programs played a key role in supporting families through the Great
Recession.
Collectively, our results point to one main conclusion: States with more accessible Head
Start programs were better able to weather the economic hardships of the recession and

Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession
experienced a more stable recovery. This result is robust to counterfactual tests and was visibly
illustrated in the exemplary cases of Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. These
findings suggest that access to childcare and family support services through Head Start
prevented many families from falling into poverty and helped others climb out of it.
DISCUSSION
Our results provide strong evidence that Head Start should be an integral component of state and
federal plans for economic recovery following a recession. States where Head Start was more
accessible experienced a smaller increase in family poverty during and after the 2007-2009
economic recession. Applying a capabilities perspective, our findings suggest that economically
vulnerable families residing in states with limited openings for Head Start enrollment faced
greater challenges and were more likely to fall into poverty. In contrast, families residing in
states with greater opportunity to enroll in Head Start received crucial support through periods of
economic hardship. Head Start’s free childcare and development programs offer a reliable, highquality, and no-cost alternative to expensive market-based childcare. Our findings echo extant
qualitative research showing that low-income parents rely heavily on early childhood programs
like Head Start. Without them, parents are often forced into unreliable, costly alternatives that
can absorb a disproportionate share of wages and increase the likelihood of labor force exit
(Newman, 2001; Scott, London, & Hurts, 2005). In addition, Head Start’s family services can
provide vital aid during periods of acute crisis as well as longer-term support through adult
educational and job training programs. In 2011, Head Start assisted 143,000 families with
housing through subsidies or support with utilities and repairs. In that same year, nearly 300,000
Head Start families participated in adult education and training (Office of Head Start 2011). In

Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession
many ways, Head Start provides crucial assistance to families who are the most vulnerable
during periods of economic recession.
States fared better during the last recession when Head Start was more widely available.
As the U.S. has entered into a COVID-19 economic recession (National Bureau of Economic
Research 2020), it is crucial that we learn lessons from the past and implement plans for
economic recovery, including stimulus packages that prioritize funding for Head Start and family
support more broadly. Such provisions are not only family-friendly policy, but they are also key
to economic recovery.
On March 25, 2020, U.S. Congress passed the CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and
Economic Security) Act as the first COVID-19 relief package. Of the $2 trillion allocated in the
bill, Head Start received $750 million to support children whose families have been affected by
COVID-19, or less than one-third of 1% of the total funding allocation. These funds are not
sustained through future years and they constitute only a small portion of Head Start’s $10.6
billion annual budget. Consequently, they are unlikely to result in significantly expanded
enrollment of Head Start which, our research shows, plays an important role in keeping families
out of poverty. One promising sign is that the CARES Act did include $3.5 billion for the Child
Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) to support families’ childcare needs. States are
given flexibility as to whether these funds are used to keep childcare providers in business after
periods of closure or to subsidize childcare costs for families.
The total stimulus funding of $4.25 billion for Head Start and CCDBG is vital to
maintain the country’s childcare infrastructure. But it is not enough. Prior to the pandemic, only
11% of families who were eligible for childcare subsidies through the CCDBG received this
support (U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2016). Although stimulus funds may increase

Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession
the number of subsidies available, demand will almost certainly surge during the recession. Head
Start accessibility is comparatively higher than CCDBG subsidy accessibility, but with fewer
than half of all eligible children enrolled nationwide (Schmit & Walker, 2016), demand far
exceeded the supply of Head Start spaces prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and will likely get
worse in the immediate future.
Our findings suggest that increased funding to expand Head Start enrollment will be a
highly effective use of stimulus funds. There is precedent for expanding federal support for Head
Start. At the end of the Great Recession, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
allocated an additional $2.1 billion to expand Head Start services. Although we cannot
disentangle how the additional Head Start spots created by these funds were distributed across
states, our findings suggest that states with higher enrollment had fewer families fall into poverty
and swifter recoveries. It is likely that the increased federal contribution at that time helped keep
many families out of poverty. As we enter the beginning of a COVID-19 related recession, it is
crucial that the federal government make similar investments now.
Ensuring that low-income families have accessible childcare and family assistance
through Head Start will give them vital support for the difficult economic times ahead. At a
minimum, all states need to enroll 100% of eligible children without further restricting eligibility
standards relative to the national guidelines. Studies suggest that it would cost an additional
$14.4 billion to reach this goal (Barnett & Friedman-Krauss, 2016). Although this would more
than double current Head Start expenditures, this amount is miniscule when compared to the
annual increases the federal government has devoted to other types of spending. In addition, the
U.S. ranks third to last among OECD nations in funding for early childhood education and care,
devoting around 0.4% of GDP to these programs (OECD, 2019). Sweden, in contrast, spends

Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession
1.8% of GDP on early childhood education and care. Spending on these programs exceeds 1.3%
of GDP in France and 0.6% of GDP in the United Kingdom. Reallocating funds to support early
childhood education and care in the U.S. will help mitigate against rising family poverty rates
and enhance economic recovery following the recession.
Our findings highlight the benefits of Head Start as a public form of childcare. There are,
however, two important limitations to consider. First, because we were interested in how Head
Start availability during the height of economic crisis related to changes in family poverty, we
used growth curve models that compared shifts in poverty rates between states with varying
Head Start enrollment during the peak of the Great Recession. We did not explore whether
changes to states’ Head Start enrollment from year to year related to concurrent changes in
poverty. Future research may investigate these dynamics to uncover whether family poverty rates
are responsive to changing levels of Head Start availability across periods taking place outside of
economic crises. Second, we focus on the Great Recession because it is a recent economic crisis.
Yet, there are important differences between this crisis and the COVID-19 recession. While the
Great Recession disproportionately affected those employed in the male-dominated
manufacturing sector, present trends indicate that the economic effects of COVID-19 are mostly
felt in service industries that are comprised of majority women workers (U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics, 2012, 2020b). We believe that these differences make the benefits of Head Start even
more consequential, as women shoulder a greater share of childcare responsibilities and have
more to gain from state childcare and development supports.
Conclusion
As states and the federal government respond to the COVID-19 economic recession, our
findings provide strong evidence that increasing financial investments in Head Start would

Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession
prevent families from falling into poverty and support economic recovery. Drawing lessons from
the last recession, we show that states with higher Head Start enrollment during the Great
Recession had fewer families in poverty and a more stable recovery. As Congress debates
stimulus packages and plans for recovery, evidence-based lessons from the country’s past are
vital: the federal government should invest in programs proven to support families. By providing
childcare, development programs, and comprehensive family services, Head Start fills a crucial
need for vulnerable families, particularly during periods of economic hardship.
