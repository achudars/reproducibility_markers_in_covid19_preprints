Background: By late January 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) had
reached Europe and most European countries had registered cases by March 1. However,
the spread of the virus has been uneven in both prevalence and speed of its propagation.
Given the role of social factors in the spread of contagious diseases and the known
demographic, economic and cultural differences in Europe, we analyse the contribution
of such factors in the coronavirus disease COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Methods: Diagnosed COVID-19 cases from the Center for Systems Science and
Engineering at Johns Hopkins University and the European Social Survey for 20
European countries were used to estimate bivariate associations between cumulative
reported case numbers ten-day intervals between March 1 and April 20, 2020 and ten
social, demographic and economic variables. To avoid overfitting, we first reduce these
variables to three factors (labelled “socially and economically vibrant”, “high-educated
and not aged”, and “densely populated and traditional”) by means of factor analysis
before conducting a multiple regression analysis. We also perform a sensitivity analysis
using rates and new cases between two time periods.
Findings: The socially and economically vibrant factor has a strong and positive
association with COVID-19 throughout the study period. The association with the

2

densely populated and traditional factor was initially low but by mid-March similar and
from April higher than the socially and economically vibrant factor.
Conclusions: For future influenza-like pandemics where a vaccine is not yet available,
early movement restrictions will be especially crucial to curb the spread of such diseases
in economically, socially, and culturally vibrant and densely populated countries.

Introduction
As of late April 2020, there were more than 3 million confirmed cases worldwide of the
coronavirus disease COVID-19 (1) that is caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARSCoV-2). It is thought that the virus was initially transmitted late 2019 to humans via live
animals contaminated by bats that were sold at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan,
China, after which it began to be spread through person-to-person transmission. Personto-person transmission occurs primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an
infected person coughs or sneezes in the close presence of other people (2, 3). Although
the epidemic initially only appeared to be affecting China and other countries quickly
placed international travel restrictions to and from China, the first cases were being
confirmed in Europe by early February and by late March about half of the world’s
reported cases were in Europe (4).
One well-established cause of global spread of previous influenza outbreaks is
airplane travel (5) and without this mode of transportation the coronavirus would not have
arrived in Europe so quickly. However, once someone brought the virus to Europe, human
interaction and close contact was also required for the virus to spread quickly. Previous
research on virus transmission, including on COVID-19, has shown that social contact is
very important (6-10). At the same time, cultural differences in Europe are well
established. In terms of social contact, in southern European countries intergenerational

3

contact is more frequent than in other parts of Europe, as social norms about providing
support to family members and maintaining interpersonal familiar interactions are
stronger than in the less family-oriented Western and Northern European countries (1112).
Patterns in social mixing are therefore embedded in socioeconomic and cultural
factors and are different across Europe, making this continent an excellent geographical
area to the study of COVID-19 proliferation. This study aims therefore to ascertain
whether countries where social interaction is considered to be more common have more
confirmed cases of COVID-19. We examine this by analyzing statistical associations
between different indicators of social ties and the reported number of confirmed cases of
COVID-19 in 23 European countries between March 1 and April 20, 2020.

Data and method
Data on the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 come from the Center for Systems

University

(1)

(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). Cross-sectional data for 18 countries from Round
9 of the European Social Survey (ESS), conducted in 2018, 4 from Round 8 (2016) and
1 from Round 7 (2014), was used to create variables to proximate different types of social
ties, which we hypothesize to be positively associated with COVID-19. i) the average
number of household members; ii) percentage living in a multi-generational household;
iii) proportion of people who have a frequent social meetings with friends, relatives, or
colleagues; iv) religious attendance. In addition, we also test the effect of the
socioeconomic variables: v) tertiary education and vi) GDP per capita (current US$) as
we assume that countries with higher proportions of tertiary educated or that are more
economically developed are more likely to have people employed and pursue non-

4

employment activities (e.g. international business meetings; skiing) that require travelling,
which increases person-to-person contact. Lastly, we test the effect of the following
demographic variables: vii) the share of the population who live in (semi-) rural areas
(expected to be negatively associated with COVID-19); viii) the share of the population
that is 65 years or older and ix) population density and x) per capita number of beds in
nursing and residential care facilities (expected to be positively associated with COVID19. More detail on the data sources (13-19) and the descriptive statistics of the covariates
can be found in Table 1.
We first analyze the bivariate associations between each variable and the ln of the
cumulative number of confirmed COVID-10 cases. We do this for six different dates
(March 1, 11, 21, 31, April 10 and 20) to check whether the type of predictor responsible
for the diffusion changed over time (Table 2). March 1 was chosen as the first date as
most of the 20 European countries had reported their first cases of COVID-19 (Table 1).
April 20 is the last date analysed as by this time all studied countries had restrictions of
movement and social interaction in place for over a month. This implies that countrydifferences in cumulative or new cases at later dates will be more and more influenced
by the different severities and timing of these restrictions rather than due to differences
in social and demographic factors. The supplementary material section provides
robustness checks by repeating the analyses by using as the dependent variable the
number of COVID-19 cases per 100.000 population and the ln of the change in cases
between each period.
Ordinary linear regression analysis was used to assess the unique association
between confirmed cases of COVID-19 and the covariates. However, as covariate data
could only be obtained for 23 countries, i.e. too few to test all covariates simultaneously
without overfitting (21-22), we first opted to reduce the number of variables by

5

performing a factor analysis. This yielded three sociodemographic-like factors that
explained 78% of the country-variation in the selected covariates. These have been
labelled “socially and economically vibrant”, “high-educated and not aged”, and “densely
populated and traditional” (see also Tables S1, S2, S3 and S4 and the explanation under
Table S1 in the supplementary material). Correlation coefficients between COVID-19
and the obtained factors were subsequently calculated. As the rotated factors are
orthogonal and thus not correlated, each covariate’s standardized coefficient is the same
as the correlation coefficient in a multivariate regression analysis. However, multivariate
regression analyses were still performed to obtain the adjusted R2 of the models as well
as the unstandardized coefficients as they represent the slope of the factors (Table S5).

Results
Figure 1 and Table 2 present the association between the number of confirmed cases of
COVID-19 and the different covariates for the six dates. The highest (and significant)
associations are observed for the social meeting and population density variables.
Particularly regarding the latter, this association gets stronger over time. As the relatively
small sample of countries does not permit us to use all covariates in a multivariate analysis,
we used the three factors that were extracted though factor analysis. Figure 2 and Table
3 present the association of each factor with the number of confirmed cases of COVID19 and are consistent with the results of the specific variables. The socially and
economically vibrant factor has a strong and positive association throughout the study
period and the highly-educated and not aged factor has a statistically insignificant
negative and declining association with the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19.
The association of densely populated and traditional factor was initially low but increased
with time, becoming significant on March 11 and the most important factor by the end of

6

March. The three factors together explain 51% of the cross-country variation in the
number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 on both March 31 and April 20, compared to
just 21% on March 1 (Table 4). The slope of the socially & economically vibrant factor
was greatest on March 11 and that of the densely populated and traditional factor on April
20.
Our sensitivity analysis shows virtually identical statistical associations between
the change in COVID-19 cases in a space of 10 days and the three sociodemographic
factors (see Supplementary Table S5). The socially and economically vibrant factor is
strongly significant across all time periods, except for the last period between April 10
and 21, while the densely populated and traditional factor was significant throughout the
entire study period and became the most important explanatory factor at the end of March.
The high-educated and not aged factor did not prove to be significant in any of the models.
The proportion of the country differences in change in COVID-19 explained by the three
factors was about the same during all but the last period (44-48%, dropping down to 38%).
The factors explain much less of the country differences in the number of cases of
COVID-19 per 100,000 population (see Supplementary table S6): the socially and
economically vibrant factor from March 31 and the densely populated and traditional
factor from April 10 but, again, becoming the most important explanatory factor. The
explanatory power did increase steadily over time from 3% (March 1) to 40% (April 20).
This is consistent with the fact that towards the end of April, the countries with high
number of cases per 100,000 population included not only Italy, but also the densely
populated Belgium and the Netherlands, while COVID-19 rates were (still) quite low in
the sparsely populated Scandinavian and Baltic countries.

Discussion

Confirmed cases of COVID-19 increased sharply across Europe during the course of
March and April, 2020. Throughout most of the studied period, Italy was worst hit by the
pandemic in absolute number of cases, but Spain surpassed Italy early April, while others
also did so in terms of cases per 100,000 people (see Table 1). The question we posed is
whether social, economic and demographic factors could explain the observed differences
in Europe.
Our results suggest that it is not so much how aged countries are but their
(historical) level of economic development and (associated) social contact that
determined the initial spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and continued to be important
for its subsequent spread during late March and early April. However, population density
and religious practice were particularly important demographic and cultural countryspecific factors associated with frequency of human-to-human contact necessary for its
subsequent spread in the most affected countries. Considering some specific examples,
the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden all scored high on the socially and
economically vibrant factor and saw their number of coronavirus infections quickly
increase during March despite households being almost exclusively single-person or
nuclear. An important component of this factor, however, is also the number of available
beds in nursing and residential care facilities, in which all three countries score high. One
recent study showed that nursery homes may be responsible for anything between 19%
and 72% of COVID-19 deaths in, respectively, Australia and Canada, with the seven
European countries included in the study observing proportions within this range; 23, see
also 24). On the other hand, Italy having been the initial epicenter of the epidemic in
Europe scored very low on “high-educated and not aged” factor, but high on “densely
populated and traditional” factor, i.e. its high population density and traditional values
8

(approximated through the proportion attending church at least once a week) is likely to
have contributed to their high levels. Interestingly, the relative position of other
traditionally catholic countries in COVID-19, including Spain, Portugal and Belgium
worsened markedly between March 21 and April 10 (Figure 2). Our sensitivity analysis
shows almost identical results if change in COVID-19 cases are analyzed over 10-day
periods, while the number of cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 population in the 23
European countries could only be weakly explained by these three factors from March 31
onwards. Again, on the last analysed date, 20 April, the population density factor proved
to be the most discriminant one, although having a socially and economically vibrant
population remained to contribute significantly to the explanation of the European
country differences as the number of cases had increased markedly in the most
socioeconomically developed European countries.
Some limitations of our study should be mentioned. First, we did not consider
country differences in (the timing of) government (and individual) responses to the
COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, governments have differed in the timing of the
implementation of measures such as public event cancellation, the closing of daycare
centers, schools and universities, social distancing, or partial or total lockdowns (see 25
for details). This implies that the effect of social and demographic factors on COVID-19
cases may be confounded by these measures in those countries that were quickest at
adopting them and had already past its peak of daily additional cases of COVID-19 (e.g.
Italy). Given the estimated average latency period between the moment that someone
becomes infected by the coronavirus and reported COVID-19, we think that only the last
two data points may be affected by this.
Other factors are also likely to be responsible for the spread of the coronavirus in
Europe that we did not consider. We know that a French and Austrian ski resort were

9

responsible for initial infections in the UK and other Northern European countries (2627). However, the influence that winter holidays or international travel has on the country
difference in COVID-19 during the studied period is likely to be captured by the tertiary
education and GDP variables, two well-known proxies for average disposable income.
Smoking is another variable associated with the proliferation of COVID-19. For instance,
there is evidence that it is considered a social function (28), smokers are more likely to
touch their face and mouth (29) and have chronic health conditions (29-30). However, we
think that smoking is a more important factor to consider in individual or small-area
studies and when studying COVID-19 mortality, as analysis showed smoking rates to be
highest in Eastern European countries, which are least “socially and economically”
vibrant and observed the lowest levels of COVID-19.
Another issue of concern is country differences in the approach to testing for
COVID-19. Some countries only test people admitted to hospitals or ramped up the
testing program much later during the outbreak than other countries. This implies that
particularly some of the earlier data points will be an underestimate of the real prevalence
of COVID-19 (31-32).
Finally, data from the ESS is not available for all European countries. This implies
that different results may be obtained if data for more countries becomes available.
Despite its availability, we did not use data from Round 9 (2018) as it contains fewer
countries that the previous round. However, this is unlikely to have biased the results as
cross-country demographic, social and cultural differences are unlikely to change in a few
years.
To conclude, our policy recommendation based on our results for similar future
outbreaks of coronavirus-like epidemics is that very strict measures of social distancing
would be required to be implemented quickly in countries with strong social ties in order

10

to minimize the proliferation of cases during the secondary transmission phase that occurs
within households. These social ties are, however, not only related to population density,
household characteristics and religious and cultural practices, but also to economic
development. This is probably why it is particularly the north of Italy, Switzerland and
some of the main urban centers of Spain (particularly Madrid) that have been hit the
hardest by COVID-19. A recommendation for future research would therefore be to
perform analysis at the sub-national level for the countries that have been studied here.

**p<0.01, *p<0.05 The Shapiro-Wilk test for normality was used to check the cross-country distribution of the variables. As a result, variables 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 were
transformed prior to analysis. Two variables were not included in the final Factors Analysis: the mean number of household members because of its high correlation with
multigenerational household but a slightly lower communality; and % population in (semi-) rural areas because the factor loadings were almost identical to the population
density variable but its association with COVID-19 was the opposite than expected. The remaining variables were used to obtain the final set of factors. The KMO test score
after excluding variables 1 and 7 equals 0.65.

Note: The principal component matrix was rotated using the Varimax method. Given the factor loadings (highest
values in bold), Factor 1 could be labelled as “socially and economically vibrant”, Factor 2 as “high-educated
and not aged”, and Factor 3 as “densely populated and traditional”. Factor 1 is also typified by a high number of
nursing care facilities per population. The countries that score highest/lowest in Factor 1 are the Netherlands,
Sweden and Switzerland/Eastern European countries; Factor 2: Ireland/Italy, Germany and Portugal; Factor 3
Netherlands, Italy/Estonia, Nordic countries except Denmark. See also Table S4.
