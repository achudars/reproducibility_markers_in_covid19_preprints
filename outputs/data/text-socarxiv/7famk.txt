Abstract:
In March 2020, the Dutch government defined a set of occupations that were designated as
crucial for maintaining the basic functioning of society during the Covid-19 pandemic. A
central question in the current public debate on work and pay is whether workers in crucial
occupations have been sufficiently remunerated for their work over the past years. Using a
combination of the Dutch labor force survey and register data during the period 2006-2019, we
find that the wages of workers in crucial occupations have on average improved over time
relative to the wages of workers in other occupations, although this development has stalled in
recent years. At the same time, workers in crucial occupations earn less relative to comparable
workers in other occupations within several industries, while they often earn more within major
occupational groups. The analysis also reveals substantial heterogeneity in wage gaps and their
trends across industries. We conclude by formulating some preliminary thoughts on the
potential long-term consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on the relationship between
occupations and wages.

Introduction

At the end of March 2020, the Dutch government issued a list of occupations that were
designated as crucial for maintaining the basic functioning of society during the Covid-19
pandemic. In order to focus on their jobs that are often associated with an increased risk of
infection (Mutambudzi et al. 2020), workers in crucial occupations were allowed to send their
children to childcare services and schools. For the rest of the population, childcare facilities
remained closed to ensure a slowdown of viral transmission.
The designation of crucial occupations by the government as a response to the Covid19 pandemic has since entered the public debate on work and pay. A central question is whether
workers in such occupations have been sufficiently remunerated for their work over the past
years. Only recently in September 2020, the Dutch federation of trade unions FNV demanded
a 5% pay raise specifically for workers in crucial occupations. Likewise, a motion asking for a
structural pay increase for health workers was brought forward in parliament. However, this
initiative was vetoed by the governing parties, a decision that was defended by the Minister of
Public Health on the grounds of recent pay rises in the health sector.
Besides the health sector, it is unknown how the labor market conditions of a broader
set of crucial occupations have developed during the past years. From a structural-functionalist
perspective, occupations are rewarded according to their ‘functional necessity’ (Davis and
Moore 1945). However, the functional importance of certain occupations during the times of a
pandemic was not necessarily acknowledged while setting labor agreements before 2020.
Other theories have emphasized that wage distributions are shaped by negotiation
processes that involve the exercise of bargaining power (Tomaskovic-Devey and Avent-Holt
2018). The occupational literature argues that existing power differentials among occupations
do not merely reflect an objective hierarchy of functional importance but are rather shaped by
broader shared values and beliefs in society that are anchored around specific criteria like

1

academic knowledge (Zhou 2005). Instead, occupational groups derive bargaining power based
on processes of professionalization and credentialing that increase the legitimacy of their claims
as a group (Abbott 1988; Vallas 2001). Also from this second perspective, it is not necessary
that existing power differences before the pandemic would have resulted in wage outcomes that
favor the crucial occupations given that they can be found throughout the established
occupational hierarchy reaching from the professions to the elementary occupations.
In this article, we trace the wages of workers in crucial occupations during the years
preceding the Covid-19 pandemic (2006-2019). We analyze yearly wage gaps in detail broken
down by industry and major occupation groups. Studying these wage trends allows us to assess
the financial rewards of crucial occupations until the start of the pandemic, and helps us to put
public claims for better working conditions of workers in crucial occupations into perspective.
As the overall impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on occupational wages are not yet fully
foreseeable, we conclude by formulating some preliminary thoughts on potential long-term
consequences.

Data and Methods
2.1 Data and sample

We use a combination of the Dutch Labor Force Survey (Enquete Beroepsbevolking, (EBB))
and Dutch register data for the period between 2006 to 2019. We limit the EBB sample to the
first observation of each respondent upon entering the rotating panel. By doing so, we set up a
repeated cross-section with a changing sample of respondents from year to year.
We supplement the EBB with wage data stemming from the Dutch tax registers. The
analysis focuses on the main job of a person that is defined as the job with the most hours
worked at the time of the survey. We aggregate all wages and hours for each main job over the
full calendar year to limit distortions based on the seasonality of additional bonus payments.

2

We restrict the sample to workers between the age of 16 and 65, and exclude respondents
working in the armed forces and extraterritorial organizations. The final weighted sample
comprises 686,539 observations. The yearly survey weights of the EBB are applied throughout
the entire analysis, but are rescaled to ensure equal weight of each year independent of the
yearly sample size.

2.2 Variables
The dependent variable in our analysis is the logged hourly nominal wage of a respondent. Our
wage measure contains all bonus payments on top of the base wage, but does not include
overwork compensation and -hours. We do not adjust for inflation as our main focus in the
analysis is on year-specific wage gaps between workers in crucial occupations relative to other
workers.
Our key independent variable is a dummy variable that identifies persons who work in
a crucial occupation. This measure is based on the list of crucial occupations that was published
by the Dutch government at the end of March 2020. We rely on two occupational classification
schemes (ISCO08 and the Dutch BRC 2014) as well as one industry classification scheme (the
Dutch SBI 2008) to designate the status of working in a crucial job.
Two important clarifications concerning our measure are warranted. First, the
identification is solely based on the list of crucial occupations published by the Dutch
government. We do not make own judgements concerning the relative importance of
occupations within the Dutch society. Instead we adopt the judgement of the Dutch government
as an institution, whose decisions not only carry real-life consequences in terms of actual
regulations during the times of the Covid-19 pandemic (e.g. who is required to go to the
workplace), but might also influence how citizens judge the importance of work done by
specific occupations in the future. Second, a definitive translation of the government list is

3

difficult to accomplish. The list denotes broad job descriptions that do not always correspond
neatly to the categories in the occupational classification schemes. We provide the translated
government list and our coding scheme as an additional appendix for interested readers to
ensure transparency of our coding decisions.
We control for several individual-level variables that are potential confounders in the
relationship between crucial occupations and wages. These controls comprise gender, age,
migration background, level of education, type of household, and the presence of a child (0-18
years old) in the same household. Age is included as a linear and quadratic term in the models.
In addition, we draw on the first digit level of the SBI (20 industry categories) and the ISCO08
(9 major occupation groups) to differentiate more detailed labor market segments.

2.3 Analytical strategy
We adopt two distinct lenses to trace wage gaps between workers in crucial occupations and
other occupations during 2006 to 2019. The first is a within-industry perspective. Here we
contrast the wages of workers in crucial occupations to other workers located in the same
industry. The underlying idea is that existing within-industry wage penalties for workers in
crucial occupations can be problematized (disregarding their occupational class position) given
that their work has been acknowledged as an important factor in maintaining the basic
functioning of society during the times of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The second is a within-occupational class perspective. In this approach, we take for
granted an established underlying hierarchy of occupational groups. Instead, we focus on
whether it pays off to work in a crucial occupation compared to working in another occupation
within the same strata of the occupational hierarchy (e.g. among professionals).
To give an example, supermarket cashiers have been designated as a crucial
occupational group. Their work contributed to the continued distribution of food among the
4

population while being exposed to a heightened risk of infection at their workplace. Although
they might earn a lower wage than workers in other occupations within the wholesale and retail
trade industry (within-industry perspective), they can still receive a pay premium relative to
workers in other occupations among the service and sales workers (within-occupational class
perspective).
We use OLS regression models to trace wage gaps between workers in crucial and other
occupations. Throughout, we focus on reporting the estimated yearly marginal effects of
working in a crucial occupation on the log hourly wage.

Results
[Table 1 about here]

In table 1, we break down all covariates by the two groups of crucial and other occupations to
get a better idea of their composition. In general, the composition of both groups is fairly similar
when it comes to the individual-level controls. Most pronounced is the difference in the gender
composition. Female workers make up more than 60% of the workers in the crucial occupations
compared to around 40% of female workers in the other occupations. Looking at wages, there
is a raw average wage gap of 1.52€/h between the two groups. The within-group variation in
hourly wages is larger among the other occupations, where exceptionally high wages are more
common.

3.1 Overall marginal effects of working in a crucial occupation on wages
[Figure 1 about here]
In a first step, we start our analysis with an assessment of average wage gaps across all
industries and major occupation groups (figure 1). Looking at the first model, there is an
estimated persistent wage penalty for working in a crucial occupations that ranges from around

5

-1% to -2%. When adjusting for the individual-level control variables, we find a reversive
pattern. An initial wage penalty at the start of the observation period (around -2%) turns into a
wage premium in the latter years up to a magnitude of around +4%.
The importance of the distinction between a within-industry and within-occupation
group perspective becomes clear when looking at model 3 and 4. Based on model 3, when
accounting for industry composition, we find a wage penalty that amounts to up to -5% in the
early years but is not statistically significantly different from 0 between 2014 to 2016. In
contrast, based on model 4 in which we control for major occupation groups, we find a
persistent wage premium that reaches up to +6% in 2016. On aggregate, workers in crucial
occupations earn less than comparable workers in other occupations within the same industry,
but earn more relative to comparable workers in other occupations within the same major
occupation group.
Noteworthy is also the overall time trend of the aggregate wage gap. Between 2006 and
2014, the wages of workers in crucial occupations continuously improve relative to workers in
other occupations. After 2014, this trend stalls and even slightly reverses starting with 2017.

3.2 Marginal effects of working in a crucial occupation on wages by industry
[Figure 2 about here]
In a second step, we analyze the yearly wage gaps individually by industry.1 Looking at the
estimates of model A, we find a statistically significant wage gap in ten out of the 20 industries.
Among those industries are the wholesale and retail trade as well as the education sector (both
around -2 to -3%). The largest wage gaps are found within the industries of agriculture (around

We model heterogenous wage gaps and time trends across industries by specifying a three-way interaction
term between the crucial occupation indicator, the time variable, and the industry categories. We resort to
modelling a linear time trend to ensure a large enough number of observations per estimate.

-10%) and waste management (around -15%). In contrast, we find a wage premium for workers
in crucial occupations within five industries, among them mining and quarrying (around +10%
to +30%) as well as human health (around +10% to +15%). When considering trends over time,
there are several industries in which the predicted wage penalty of working in a crucial
occupation has grown over time. This includes among others the industries of transportation
(from around -2% to -3%) and public administration (from around -1% to -5%). In other
industries, the wage gap has become smaller over time as visible in the construction (from
around -12% to -2%) and manufacturing industry (from around -9% to -5%).
In model B, we control additionally for major occupation groups to trace in how far
wage gaps within industries are related to the composition of groups in terms of occupational
classes. With the sole exception of the education sector, all initially estimated industry-specific
wage penalties are largely accounted for when controlling for the major occupation groups. For
example, the wage penalty of working in a crucial occupation within the waste management
industry is fully explained by those workers being more strongly concentrated in, on average,
lower-paid segments of the occupational hierarchy.

3.3 Marginal effects of working in a crucial occupation on wages by industry
[Figure 3 about here]
In a last step, we trace the yearly wage gaps by each major occupation group.2 Based on model
C, we find a wage premium for working in a crucial occupation within three of the nine major
occupation groups. Working in a crucial occupation pays off within the groups of clerical
support workers (around +6%), services and sales workers (around +17% to +22%), and
elementary occupations (around +6% to +7%). Within other major occupational groups there
is a reversive pattern. An initial wage penalty becomes smaller over time and even turns into a
2

We employ a similar modelling approach as in section 3.2. The sole difference is that we swap the role of the
major occupation group and industry indicator.

7

wage premium among managers (from around -7% to +4%) and the professions (from around
-7% to +1%). A persistent wage penalty can be found among technicians (from around -4% to
-1%) and craft workers (around -4% throughout).
Looking at model D, we find that group differences in the composition by industry
partially account for the wage premium of workers in crucial occupations among the service
and sales workers and the elementary occupations. Within these two major occupation groups,
workers in crucial occupations earn higher wages than workers in other occupations partly
because they are located in comparatively well-paying industries. Among the professionals, the
composition by industries explains a substantial part of the initial wage penalty for workers in
crucial occupations.

Discussion

To summarize, the wages of workers in crucial occupations have on average improved over
time relative to the wages of workers in other occupations, although this development has
stalled in recent years. While workers in crucial occupations earn less than comparable workers
of other occupations inside several industries, they often earn more within several major
occupation groups. At the same time, the analysis reveals substantial heterogeneity in wage
gaps and their trends particularly across industries.
While the overarching impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the wages of occupations is
not yet fully foreseeable, there is room to theorize on potential consequences. Considering the
socio-economic hierarchy of occupations, Parkin (1971, p.42) claimed that “certain criteria
become institutionalized as ‘relevant’ for ranking purposes, […]” and “once a given set of rank
criteria has been successfully legitimized throughout society, then the main lines of the status
order will have been laid down”. The experience of the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent
government response of designating certain occupations as crucial may lead to a reconfiguration

8

of those criteria. The questions of whether the Covid-19 pandemic will cause an increase in
relative wages of workers in crucial occupations and whether this will diminish (withinindustry) wage gaps between established strata of the occupational hierarchy should be on the
agenda for future research in the field of social stratification.
