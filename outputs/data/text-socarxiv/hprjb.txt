Abstract
The radical changes to everyday life brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and the closure of
non-family social spheres in particular may have impacted marriage dynamics. We provide
evidence on the monthly rates of initiation of divorce and separation filings in Denmark for the
period 2016-2020 to examine how filing behavior changed during 2020 compared to the four
previous years. Because filing rates precedes a divorce, rates reflect more precise the temporal
dynamic of divorce initiation. Rates of initiation of divorce filings declined in 2020 to the lowest
level in the period 2016-2020. On average, monthly rates in 2020 were 7 percent lower than 2019
rates and 20 percent lower than 2016 rates. There is little indication of the COVID-19 pandemic
having an immediate influence on divorce dynamics, although the filing rate was more depressed
during lockdown periods.

1. Introduction
Stay-at-home orders and suggestions following the COVID-19 pandemic has caused substantial
changes to everyday life for families, who quite literally are stuck at home together. While the
findings on the impact of the pandemic and the measures governments have used to counter it on
mental health and relationship quality are mixed (e.g., Andersen, Fallesen, and Bruckner 2020;
Kowal et al. 2020; Mari et al. 2020), concerns have been raised on the impact of stay-at-home
orders for couples in general (Luetke et al. 2020; Pietromonaco and Overall 2020; Stanley and
Markman 2020) and couples with higher levels of conflict in particular (Lebow 2020; Pieh et al.
2020; Zhang 2020). On the one hand, pandemic-induced stress and anxiety may increase levels of
conflict. On the other hand, the external threat posed by the pandemic may cause people to hunker
down in familial units to ride out the pandemic.
Initial data from five US states found that the divorce count declined in 2020 compared to
previous years for four out of five states, simultaneously with a decline in number of marriages
(Manning and Payne 2020). Yet, a finalized divorce is the last step of a process that starts with an
initial legal filing, and may or may not, depending on the legal statutes of given state, also entail
some period of mandatory separation before couples can divorce can be finalized (Moore 2016;
Smith 2009). In that sense, divorce rates may provide a delayed picture of couples’ behavior and the
timing of finalization of divorces may also be susceptible to administrative bottlenecks, such as
those created by work-from-home orders. Further, decline in number of divorces can be driven both
by a smaller share of married couples divorcing, or by a decline in the number of married couples
who can divorce. Raw divorce counts cannot distinguish between those two dimensions.
In this study, we report findings on the development of the monthly rate of separation and
divorce filings and the monthly divorce rate in Denmark for the period 2016-2020 using newly
released data provided by the Danish Agency of Family Law as well as population data provided by

3

Statistics Denmark. We show that filing data likely give a more temporally precise metric of
changes in divorce intention than does the rate of finalized divorces due to non-constant distortion
in time between filing and actualization of divorce. 2020 had the lowest rate of divorce and
separation filings in the last five years, indicating that the COVID-19 pandemic so far has not
influenced divorce behavior in Denmark.

2. Methodology and data
2.1 Data
We use two sets of data sources. First, vital statistics provided by Statistics Denmark on the
quarterly stock of married individuals reported first day of each quarter, 2016-2020 (Statistics
Denmark 2021b) and monthly data on finalized divorces from January 2016 to September, 2020
(Statistics Denmark 2021a, 2021c).2 Second, monthly data on filings for divorces and separations
acquired from the Danish Agency of Family Law that covered all filings for the period January
2016 to December 2020. To obtain the stock of married couples, we divide number of married
individuals by 2. Table 1 provides overview of the data.
[Table 1 to be here]
2.2 Temporal validity of measures
In the start of 2019, the jurisdiction for divorce cases was moved from the Danish State
Administration to the Danish Agency of Family Law. This caused substantial delay in processing of
divorce cases (Ret&Råd Advokater 2020), but did not influence the possibility to file for divorce or
separation. In uncontested cases where both partners agreed to the divorce decision, couples did not

2

As of January 2021, data on divorces in the final quarter of 2020 were not available yet. Also, we use start of
quarter instead of mid-point because data on stock of married individuals for the 1 st quarter of 2021 is not available yet.

4

have to undergo a mandatory period of separation (see Fallesen 2020; Rosenbeck 2017 for details).3
Thus, the divorce rate is likely a poor measure for actual dissolution behavior within a more finegrained measure of time due to administrative delays, whereas filings for divorce and separation
provide a more timely measure. The downside is that filing for divorce or separation is not equal to
the later divorce rate, because couples may reconcile before finalizing their divorce decision
(Fallesen 2020; Kabátek 2019; Lee 2013). But when wanting to study relationship behavior during
rapid changes such as the COVID-19 pandemic, where work for home orders may also cause
further administrative bottlenecks for finalizing divorce cases, filing rates may provide more precise
indications of trends if not of magnitudes.
2.3 Methodology
To calculate rates for filings for divorce and separation and for finalized divorces, we use the
following formula:
𝑅𝑚,𝑦 =

𝑛𝑚,𝑦
∗ 1,000
𝑀𝑞,𝑦

where R is the rate expressed as occurrences per 1,000 married couples for month m in year y, n is
the number of events (either filings or finalized divorces) occurring in a month, and M is the stock
of married couples at the beginning of a quarter q. On source of imprecision is that couples that
already have filed for separation or divorce, but not yet finalized their divorce, remain is the
denominator until the divorce is finalized.
To evaluate how the divorce filing rate in 2020 compared to previous years’ rates, we calculate
p-scores using the monthly rates for each of the four preceding years:

3
For the period April 2019 to end of June 2020, parents who applied for direct divorce had to undergo a threemonth reflection period before they could finalize their divorce, but they could still find directly for divorce without
having to file for separation first.

5

𝑅𝑚,2020 − 𝑅𝑚,𝑦≠2020
𝑃𝑚,𝑦 = (
) ∗ 100%
𝑅𝑚,𝑦≠2020
where 𝑃𝑚,𝑦 measures the percentage difference between the monthly rate in 2020 and the monthly
rate for one of the preceding years. A negative p-score indicates lower rate in 2020, and a positive
p-score indicates a higher rate. We also calculate annual p-scores, and monthly p-scores measured
against the average rates for each month of the last four years. Because we rely on full population
data, we dispense with calculating confidence intervals.

3. Results
Figure 1 shows the divorce rate and the divorce and separation filing rate for the period 2016-2020
at a monthly level, as well as the smoothed rates using a loess smoothing. The filing rate decreases
monotonically and close-to-linearly across the period. In contrast, the divorce rate declines linearly
until end of 2018, then takes a discrete decline in first half of 2019, to then begin increasing until
end of the observation window in September 2020. As discussed in the Methodology and Data
section above, the agency that administrates Danish family law underwent restructuring in 2019,
which as seen from the data led to substantial delay in finalizing divorces.
[Figure 1 to be here]
From Figure 1 the filing rate for 2020 appears to show similar patterns of seasonality as the
previous years, although the filing rate in December 2020 appear even more depressed than
observed in previous years. December 2020 saw Denmark initiate the second COVID-19 lockdown,
with the first lockdown occurring in mid-March to mid-April 2020 (Roser et al. 2021). Figure 2
shows the p-score for the monthly filing rate for 2020 compared to the four previous year, as well as
compared to the average monthly rate across all four years (the black dashed line) and compared to
annual rates (colored dashed lines). This allows us to more precisely judge whether 2020 saw
substantially different patterns of seasonality than did previous years.

6

[Figure 2 to be here]
The annual p-score declines in absolute terms as the comparison year moves closer to 2020 (as
could be inferred from Figure 1). Compared to 2016, the 2020 filing rate was 20 % lower, but
compared to the 2019 rate it was only 7 percent lower. The variation across month appears more
uniform when we compare 2020 compare to each of the preceding years. July 2020 stands out with
filing rates close to the average for the four previous years. This coincides with the discontinuation
of a required three month long reflection period that parents with children younger than 18 had to
undergo before a divorce filing could be finalized (Lessel 2020). Beyond July, two other periods
stand out—March-May, and November-December, both periods that saw more stringent lockdown
measures to tackle COVID-19 than the other parts of 2020 (Roser et al. 2021). Even compared to
2019, filing rates in December 2020 were 26 % lower. Thus, there are some indications of further
depression of filing rates during lockdown periods compared to the rest of 2020.

4. Conclusion and Discussion
There is so far no evidence indicating an increase in peoples’ intention to divorce during the
COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark compared to previous years. Instead, in 2020, filing rates
continued a decline that has been ongoing since at least 2016, and the 2020 uptick in the Danish
divorce rate was due to administrative delays of finalizing divorces likely filed for prior to the onset
of the pandemic. This does however not mean that the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately cannot lead
to an increase in divorce, only that it so far in Denmark has not done so yet.4 First, stay-at-home
orders may cause couples who eventually would have divorced anyway to divorce faster because
they gain information about their partner at a faster rate during lockdown (cf. Fallesen and Breen
2016). Second, depending on the long term economic consequences of the pandemic, divorce rates

Italy, for example, has reported a 60 % increase in separation requests in 2020 compared to 2019 (ANSA 2021).

7

may also increase as a response to the business cycle although findings on this are mixed (Schaller
2013; Stevenson and Wolfers 2007).
For Denmark, the ongoing declining filing rate may also be a function of married couples having
become a more select, and therefore perhaps more stable, group in Denmark within the last decade.
Between 2008-2011, the Danish marriage rate declined from 16.3 annual new marriages per 2,000
unmarried individuals aged 15+ to a rate of 11.5, and had at the end of the 2010s still not returned
to the level of previous decades (own calculation on data from Statistics Denmark 2021b, 2021a).
Divorce risk is generally higher during the first ten years of a marriage (Kulu 2014). So, with fewer
recently married couples, as well as the potential for the lower marriage rate reflecting a more select
group of couples who choose to marry, this could explain the ongoing decline in divorce filing rate.
Yet, even with this in mind, there still is no indication of any uptick in divorce seeking behavior
during the COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark.
The study has reported on the development on filing rates for divorce and separation in
Denmark. It has argued that during periods of rapid changes that may pose challenges to the
bureaucratic systems that manages family affairs, filing rates can provide a more timely but less
precise indicator of family processes. However, the value of filing rates as an indicator depends
partly on the how access to divorce is regulated in a given country. For example, Italy has reported
a 60 percent increase in separation filings during 2020 compared to 2019 (ANSA 2021). Yet, in
Italy separations are mandatory, may be lengthy, and a substantial share of couples reconciles
during a separation (Fallesen 2020; Kabátek 2019; Lee 2013). So, the ultimately value of the filing
rate as an indicator for changes in divorce behavior depends on the context. For a country such as
Denmark that allows immediate divorce in uncontested cases and after a six-month separation in
contested cases, it likely provides a robust indicator of the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on family
processes.
