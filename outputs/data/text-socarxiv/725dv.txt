Abstract
Around 1.8 billion Muslims worldwide celebrate in some extent the holy month of Ramadan during COVID-19
pandemic. Some increase their attendance worship sites and traditional dining in extended families, so
infectious contact rates could increase. Moreover, fasting could increase the probability of acquiring
SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are mitigation measures (e.g. Healthy Ramadan by WHO) applied to reduce the
SARS-CoV-2 spread, however their real impact is still unknown. Multiple studies assessed observed effects of
contact rates increase during holidays as Chinese New Year in January and Passover and Easter in April and
their short-time effects on COVID-19 transmission dynamics. However, there are any quantitative attempts
considering epidemiological consequences of the holy Ramadan (at least up to our knowledge and keywords
search in various databases until the submission day). We analyze the fractions of Muslims and time series of
COVID-19 daily incidence and cases numbers for 197 countries and territories. We found statistically
significant positive link with proportion of Islam adherents with increase in normalized new cases of
COVID-19 during 1-18 May 2020. Moreover, growth of incidences in May is statistically significantly greater
than in a control (April).

Problem Introduction
The COVID-19 case registry (ECDC 2020) and proportion of Muslim population fractions
(Pew 2020) give an opportunity to compare possible role of the holy Ramadan in disease
propagation. Religious norms are rules that prescribe what people should and should not
do in a social environment. Celebration of Easter and Passover in 2020 affected contact
patterns to a large extent worldwide (especially in Europe), but only in the short-term of a
few days only (Chen, et al. 2020). However, the holy Ramadan lasts much longer, so a
possible effect on SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics could be greater. Moreover,
concerning the meaning ascribed to eating, Ramadan stands in contrast to everyday
musilm practices. When eating is usually considered as a private act, during Ramadan it
becomes a collective act.
While the traditions associated with fasting and gathering in worship sites with Ramadan
this month (23.04-23.05.2020 CEST) are well established, they could affect SARS-CoV-2
spread. People are instructed by authorities (WHO 2020) by advising on physical
distancing; encouraging healthy hygiene; frequently cleaning worship sites, etc.
But how will adherence to healthy instructions or religious norms affect the pandemic
shape? Disregarding medical and all other differences, we are trying to investigate the

relative religious adherence to predict relative penetration of COVID-19 pandemic
internationally during 1-18 May 2020.

State of the art and Working hypothesis
There are plenty of attempts (Khan & Lehebi, 2020; Yaqub, et al., 2020) to link fasting
(issues as dehydration, lower physical activity levels, sleeping rescheduling, an inability to
take medications) with immunity deficiency and higher risk of being infected with
SARS-CoV-2 or developing severe illnesses. Traditionally sharing meals, iftar and suhur,
with a greater number of people and praying together in worship sites could increase
infectious contacts.
However, up to our knowledge, there is no study showing quantitative links between
Ramadan and the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Our working hypothesis is that Muslims undergo
various lifestyle changes during Ramadan, which could lead to:
- increase of infectious contact rates (sharing meals and praying together in worship sites);
- increase of infection probability per contact (immunodeficiency due to fasting).
We decided to start our observation since 1st of May due to disease incubation period and
the last day is 18.05.2020.
This is important to mention, that compliance with authorities measures (e.g. healthy
Ramadan by WHO (WHO 2020)) could at the same time decrease infectious contact rate
(by physical distancing) or decrease probability of infection per contact (by healthy
hygiene and cleaning worship sites).

Measurable variables and data curing
We have correlated infection dynamics with Muslim population in for each country with
available indexes as:
● % of Muslim - proportion of Islam adherents in the country (Pew 2014).
● regression in cases - linear regression coefficient between daily case series and
consequential days in a given period (May or April) for each country. It tells us
what are the trends in the total number of cases.
● regression in incidence - linear regression coefficient between daily incidence per
100 000 inhabitants series and consequential days in a given period (May or April)
for each country. It tells what are the trends in incidence.
● regression in normalized cases - linear regression coefficient between daily case
series and consecutive days in a given period (May or April) divided by mean of
daily number of cases in a given period for each country. It tells what are the trends
in the number of cases, with 1 to be the mean number of normalized cases.
Positive regression value means an increasing trend in a given observable (incidence and
normalized cases); negative otherwise; 0 means stable situation.

We include for analysis these countries, which reported new infection cases for each day in
the respective time period May – with possible effect of Ramadan (96/89 countries) and
April – control (147 countries).

Results
We can see a relationship in linear regressions [Tab. 1] between regression in incidence/
normalized cases and % Muslims in May (possibly affected by Ramadan) and April
(Control).

Tab. 1) Linear regressions with dependent variables describing infection dynamics with
possible effect of Ramadan (in May) or retrospective control (in April) and independent
variable - a proportion of Muslims for each country.

Fig. 1) Scatter plot between regression in incidences and % of Muslims (plotted only
countries > 1%) with linear trend line in Mai 2020. Node’s color corresponds to regression
in a number of cases.
There is an insignificant relationship positive association between incidence and % of
Muslims [Fig. 1, Tab. 1].

Fig. 2) Scatter plot between regression in normalized cases and % of Muslims (plotted
only countries > 1%) with linear trend line in Mai 2020. Node’s color corresponds to
regression in a number of cases. Node’s size corresponds to regression in incidence.
There is a statistically significant relationship (p-Value <.05) between regression of cases
and % of Muslims [Fig. 2, Tab. 1].
As a control, let compare regressions in April, where we do not see any relationship
between infection dynamics and proportion of Muslims [Fig. 3, Tab. 1].
Increasing trends in COVID-19 cases in countries with higher Islam adherents fraction in
May (and no such a link in control month April) could by potentially explained by the
increased infectious contact rates or/and inceased infection probability due to changing
eating habits during of the holy Ramadan.

Fig. 3) Scatter plot between regression in incidences and % of Muslims (plotted only
countries > 1%) with linear trend line in April 2020. Node’s color corresponds to
regression in a number of cases. Node’s size corresponds to regression in a normalized
number of cases.

Moreover, one side t-test (for countries with % of Muslims>10) between regression in
incidences in May ([Fig. 1] Ramadan, mean=7.3) vs regression in incidences in April ([Fig.
3] control, mean=2.05) shows statistically significant increase in incidence (df = 56, p-value
= 0.04 mean of the differences =5.25).

Conclusions
We showed that there is a statistically significant positive relationship between the
proportion of Muslims and increase of COVID-19 cases in May 2020 and we proved that
incidences during Ramadan period (May) are statistically significantly greater than during
control (April).
Ramadan is more or less celebrated this pandemic year by 1.8 billion Islam adherents,
making up about 24% world population. The results emphasize the need to pay more
attention to sociological (Jarynowski, et al. 2020) and cultural context when comparing
outbreak dynamics and mitigation strategies between countries.
However, there are plenty of limitations of this illustrative study. Increased cases could be
an artefact of better surveillance in this special time in Muslim populations. During
Ramadan this year, some counties closed mosques (e. g. Norway) some not (e. g. Germany).
There are also various adherence levels to Ramadan rules within Muslims worldwide

e.g. 20% in Morocco and 90% in UAE (Statista 2020). Moreover, compliance to hygienic
and physical distancing measures differ significantly between countries (EU 2020).
Concluding for a short-term impact of Ramadan during a pandemic (beyond the first 18
days of May) is still unknown and a complete picture will be available probably 2-4 week
after Ramadan finishes with additional control in COVID-19 deaths and in policy variations,
medical system, climate, arrival times, seroprevalence, etc in different countries too.
