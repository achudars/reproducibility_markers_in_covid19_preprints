"10" "Abstract"
"11" "The SARS-C o V - 2 virus, originated  in Wuhan  ( China ) at the end of 2019 ,  rapidly spread in more than 100 countries. Researchers in different fields have been working on finding  explanations  for  the  unequal  impact  of the virus ,   and deaths from the associated disease (COVID-19),  in different  geographical areas . Demographers and other social scientists, have  hint ed   at the importance of demographic factors, such as age structure and intergenerational relationships.  The  goal of this article is to reflect on the possible link between intergenerational relationships and COVID-19   cases  in a critical way .  W e show that with available aggregate data  it  is not possible to draw robust evidence  to support such a link .  In fact, at the country-level higher prevalence of intergenerational co-residence and contacts is  broadly   positively associated with number of COVID-19 cases (per 100,000 persons), but the opposite is generally true at the sub-national level.  While  this inconsistent eviden ce   neither  demonstrate s  the  existence   n or  the  inexistence of  a  causal  link  between intergenerational relationships  and  the  prevalence of  COVID-19  cases ,  we  warn against simplistic interpretation s  of the available data   which suffer from many shortcomings.  Only  retrospective  individual level data will provide robust evidence on the role of intergenerational ties. W e  conclude arguing that  intergenerational relationships  are not only about  physical contacts between family members . From a theoretical point of view ,  different forms of intergenerational relationships may have causal effects   of opposite sign  on  the  diffusion of COVID-19 .  Policies devoted at fighting the spread of COVID-19 should also take into account that intergenerational ties are a source of instrumental and emotional support, which may favor compliance to the lockdown and “phase-2” restrictions and may buffer their negative consequences on mental health."
"12" "Introduction"
"13" "The  rapid spread  of the  SARS-CoV-2   made urgent  the need to understand  which factors contribute to the diffusion of the virus .  The disease associated with the virus, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),  is particularly deadly for  older people  (W u  and McGoogan, 2020)  and it has been  argue d  that the high prevalence of infected  older people  is  crucial  to understand  the  high  Case F a ta lit y  R ate  (CFR) observed  in some countries, such as Italy (Dowd et al. 2020 ;  Dudel  et al 2020 ).   R esearchers have  also  hinted at intergenerational relationships  (IR)  as a  driver of COVID-19  cases , especially among older people  ( Bayer  and  Kuhn   2020 ). In particular, it was argued that “intergenerational interactions, co - residence ,  and commuting  may have accelerated the outbreak in Italy through social networks that increased the proximity of elderly to initial cases” ( Dowd et al, 2020 )."
"14" "The goal of this  paper  is to reflect on the link between  IR  and the  prevalence  of COVID-19  cases .  W e show that with available aggregate data it is not possible to draw robust evidence to support such a link. While we cannot demonstrate whether there is or  there is  not a  ( causal )  link between  IR  and  COVID-19  cases ,  our  analyses  at the  sub-national  level   warn against simplistic interpretations of country level   associations. We also discuss possible theoretical links between  IR  and the spread of COVID-19 that  may  work in opposite directions ."
"15" "Physical i ntergenerational relationships and  the spread of COVID-19"
"16" "In line with simulation models of the spread of infectious diseases ( Germann  et al,  2006 ;  Mossong  et al., 2008), physical  contact is the main transmission mode  of COVID-19  ( Huang et al, 2020;  Peeri  et al, 2020 ), implying a positive link between physical contacts and infection rates. With physical contact we refer to face-to-face meetings between at least two persons, being these relatives, friends, colleagues or other people."
"17" "Contact  frequency  between family members  is stable over the life course and  constitute a large part of  individuals’  overall contacts ( Sander  et al,  2017 ;  Wrzus  et al,  2013 ) , especially   i n some countries  where  contacts between grandparents and their grandchildren and between parents and their children are considerably more frequent than in other s  ( Dykstra , 2018;  Reher , 1998 ) . Italy and Spain, two of the  European  countries most seriously hit by the COVID-19 pandemic ,  are also among the countries who display higher  prevalence  of  intergenerational co-residence ( Albertini and Kohli, 2013;  Tomassini et al 2004;  Glaser et al, 2018;  Grundy and Murphy, 2018 )  and  of frequent  intergenerational contacts  between older parents and their adult children  ( e.g., Bordone ,  2009; Hank ,  200 7 ;  Yahirun  and  Hamplová , 2014 ) and  their grandchildren ,   also  due to intensive  grand parental  childcare ( Bordone et al ,  2017 ; Price et al, 2018 ).   This  may suggest  a sort of “intergenerational contact s  hypothesis ”, assuming that  in countries where  intergenerational face-to-face contact s  between family members  are  more frequent, higher infection rates are observed."
"18" "This hypothesis has been  recently put forward  in the public and academic debate. For example, Balbo et al (2020) and Dowd et al (2020) argue that the comparatively higher prevalence of intergenerational co-residence and contacts in Southern Europe, and in particular in Italy, imply a higher vulnerability to epidemics that disproportionately affect older adults in these countries.  A similar argument has been made by  Esteve  et al (2020) with respect to Spanish provinces. The only direct e vidence in support to the “intergenerational contacts hypothesis” has been , however,  provided at the country level by Bayer and Kuhn (2020). Using data from 24 countries (Australia plus some European and East-Asia countries), the authors found a positive correlation at the country level between the percentage of adults aged 30-49 living with their parents and CFR. The authors argue that this finding highlights the role of  IR  in spreading COVID-19 to  older people .   The article by  Bayer and Kuhn  (2020) has been criticized by  Belloc et al (2020)  that in  their commentary  noted that if  when  compar ing  Italian regions  an  opposite result  would be obtained . We extend the analyses in these contributions by considering a larger  set of IR indicators at both country and subnational level and from two different datasets. We also add a brief theoretical discussion on non-physical intergenerational relationships."
"19" "Methods"
"20" "Data"
"21" "Cumulative n umber of COVID-19 cases  w ere  drawn  from  a public repository, which daily collects data directly from each  country’s ministry of health ( https://github.com/open-covid-19/data#response ).  To account for  vastly  different population sizes across the considered countries and regions, we consider the total number of cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Because of the necessity to merge different sources of data, some harmonization measures were taken. First, while COVID-19 cases at  the country level were collected on the last available date at the time of finalizing this work (27 th  of April 2020), an exception has been made for Belgium and Estonia, for which the last available information was only available for two days earlier (25 th  of April).  Second, data at the subnational level were only available for some of the considered countries. Thus, the within-country analyses have been made possible only for  8 countries (France,  Germany, Italy,  Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,  Switzerland ) . Moreover, for France, the last available information on reported cases and deaths at the regional level was dated back to the 26 th  of March 2020. We also notice that while the FSS2016 dataset provides data for all the Italian regions, the SHARE survey did not include cases for  the  Valle d’Aosta  region ."
"22" "Data on  IR  were taken from two sources: The Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and the  Italian National Statistical   Office  (ISTAT)  survey on family and  social subjects  ( FFS 2016) . SHARE it is a longitudinal survey on individuals aged 50+ in several European countries  plus Israel .  We  exclud ed  Israel in order to focus on European countries only ; thus,   the  analyses  were carried out on  1 9  countries (Austria, Belgium,   Czech Republic ,  Denmark,  Estonia ,  France ,  Germany ,  Greece ,  Hungary,  Ireland ,  Italy ,  Luxembourg ,  Netherlands ,  Poland ,  Portugal ,  Slovenia ,  Spain ,  Sweden ,  Switzerland ).   To maximize the sample size at the NUTS- 2  level we have pooled all  regular  waves  ( 1, 2, 4 - 6 )  and taken the first observation for each individual to avoid issues of selective attrition. We excluded waves 3 and 7 because they (mainly) collected retrospective information."
"23" "FFS is a repeated cross-sectional survey on the Italian population aged 18+. We have considered the  last available wave  ( collected in  2016 )  which covers detailed  information of about 24,753 individuals.  These data allow obtaining estimates at NUTS-2 level (regions) with sufficient precision (sample size range  515 - 2050 )."
"24" "Variables"
"25" "Information on family ties  from SHARE and FFS data,  aggregated at both country and regional levels , have been used to measure  four  specific aspects of IR :   co-residence,  geographic proximity ,   contact  frequency  and  provision of  grand child care.   In the case of the SHARE data we measured IR indicators restricting the sample to individuals 60+. The analyses based on FFS data used both the whole sample (18+) and the 60+ subsample.  The rational of considering the 60+ population rests  o n the fact that older people are the most vulnerable to the COVID-19 disease. We also estimated all IR measures on the population 18+ because the whole population is at-risk of contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus. By considering the 18+ population  at the denominator of the IR indicators , we also automatically account for differences across geographical areas in the number of children, grandchildren ,  and parents  people have  (alive)."
"26" "Intergenerational co-residence   was  assessed by  calculating  the prevalence of respondents  (aged 18+ and/or 60+)  living in multi-generational household s  (two or more generations) ."
"27" "Geographical  proximity   is  differently  measured in  the SHARE and the FSS survey s . More specifically, we  were able to  use , alternatively,  5  and  25 Km  as thresholds for  geographic proximity  in the analyses based on SHARE data  and 16 Km for the  FFS  data .   SHARE only provides information on  geographical proximity  to  children.  We calculated  the percentage of  individ uals   living close  t o  at least one  child  and,   for the FFS data only, also the percentage of individuals living close to  at least one  parent  and   grandchild ."
"28" "Frequency of contacts   was also measured differently in the SHARE and FFS surveys. SHARE collects information on contact frequency of any type (physical and non-physical) with each respondent’s child. With FFS data we were able to measure physical contacts with parents and up to three children, and grandchildren (those with whom the respondent has the  most contacts).   With SHARE data we calculated the percentage of individuals aged 60+ who have weekly or daily contacts with at least one child.   In o rder to provide a measure of contacts  that  account s  also for the number of children the respondent has, we  additionally  measured the mean of the (equivalent) total number of daily contacts with all children  in a year .   Similarly, with the FFS data we  calculated the mean of the (equivalent) total number of daily contacts with parents, children ,  and grandchildren  in a year , separately for  the population  18+ and 60+."
"29" "Grandparental childcare   is measured in SHARE by asking  grandparents  the frequency of care provided  to their grandchildren, separately  for each respondent’s child . We estimated the percentage of individuals 60+ who provide any / daily / weekly care to at least one grandchild.  Similarly  to what we did for contact frequency, we estimated  the mean of the (equivalent) total number of daily grandchild care. The FFS data do not provide frequency of grandchild care. In this case, we estimated the mean number of grandchildren for whom care is provided, both for the 18+ and 60+ populations."
"30" "Each IR indicator was estimated using sampling weights both at the country- and at the NUTS-2 level."
"31" "Statistical a nalyses"
"32" "We perform very simple statistical analyses to examine associations between IR and COVID-19 cases.  Our analyses are organized in three steps. First, using SHARE data we examine country-level associations between several IR measures and COVID-19 cases  ( for  19 countries) . Secondly, with the SHARE data we account for the within-country variability in both IR and COVID-19 and examine correlations at the NUTS-2 level.  These analyses are restricted to the 8 countries for which we have subnational information on COVID-19 cases. For Germany, COVID-19 cases are available at the NUTS-1 level instead of NUTS-2.  Finally, we zoom in on Italy and re-examine the associations at the NUTS-2 level using data from the nationally representative FFS survey on the 18+  and 60+  population s . We examine Italian data in more detail because , as discussed in the  Introduction ,  there is a vast literature  on the comparatively  high er  prevalence of intergenerational co-residence and frequent contacts in this country. Italy has also been among the first non-Asian countries to be severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the spread of COVID-19 cases in Italy has been taken as a n illustrative case  for the “intergenerational contacts hypothesis” (Dowd et al, 2020; Balbo et al, 2020)."
"33" "Associations at the country- and  regional -level are estimated both using the standard Pearson (linear) correlation coefficient and the non-parametric Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. The advantage of the latter is that it only takes the ranks of the two examined variables into account and so it is less sensitive to outliers, deviations from a linear relationship and measurement errors, which are likely to be particularly serious for the number of COVID-19 cases. Using SHARE data, we also estimate a very simple  linear regression model taking the 118 available regions as the unit of analysis. We first standardized and then decomposed each IR indicator in its regional and country components, as often done in multilevel or longitudinal analyses to separate between and within effects. More specifically, we calculated the country mean of each indicator (between or country effect) and the regional deviations from the country mean (within or regional effect). In this way, the same regression model is able to estimate both country- and regional- level associations. Also, differently from correlation coefficients, this model inform s  about the  strength of the associations, i.e. it gives the “effect” of a standard deviation increase in each IR   indicator on the number of COVID-19 cases.  We accounted for within country correlation in the IR indicators by using clustered standard errors."
"34" "It is well-known that data on COVID-19 cases are affected by several methodological issues (see e.g. ,  Bohk -Ewald  et al,  2020) , but they represent the best information available to date on infections covering many countries and regions. Measurement errors in the number of COVID-19 cases is not clearly associated with our key variables of interest , IR. However, if even measurement error was completely random estimates would be biased toward zero. In any case, estimates from macro-level analyses should be interpreted with caution."
"35" "Results"
"36" "Between-country associations (1 9  European countries)"
"37" "Tab l e  1   reports weighted descriptive summary statistics at the country level of IR indicators sorted according to the mean number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents. A  greyscale  has been used to   split up the  distribution  of each variable in  tertiles ,  with the lighte st  grey for  countries  below 33% and the darke st   for those  above the 66%  percentile .  From this table it does not emerge a clear pattern of association between the prevalence of COVID-19 cases and  IR  at the country level. In fact, in several cases, countries in the highest  tertiles  of COVID-19 cases fall in the lowest  tertiles  of IR indicators and vice versa. For example, Slovenia, Greece and Portugal display the highest values of intergenerational co-residence (≥ 40%) and  comparatively  low prevalence of COVID-19 cases."
"38" "The lack of a clear pattern of association at a country level is also confirmed by the correlation matrix and linear regression estimates presented in Table 2. Table 2 reports  Pearson's  and  Spearman’s correlation coefficient s  between the number of confirmed cases of   COVID-19  per 100,000 people  and  each IR indicator. Although no  correlation   is   statistically significant, a positive  association  is observed for geographic proximity with children and for frequency of contacts with them ,  but a negative one  is found  for living in multi-generational household s  and for grandchild care provision, especially if intensive (i.e., daily)."
"39" "Restricting the sample to the 8 countries for which data at the regional level are available (columns 4-5, Table 2) confirm the mixed findings about the association of COVID-19 cases and IR indicators: positive associations are found for  co-residence,  geographic proximity  and  intergenerational contacts , while  a negative one for grandchild care provision."
"40" "Finally, estimates of a  linear regression  model   on the  available  118 regions are reported in the last two columns of Table 2. The country-level effect s  of IR indicator s   are  always positive, although not statistically significant. The only exception is found for provision of grandchild care which display, consistently with the correlation analysis, a negative association with COVID-19 cases (p<0.1). At the regional-level, regression estimates show a negative association between the regional deviation from the country’s mean level of IR and COVID-19 cases for all the considered variables except for the general prevalence of grandchild care provision and weekly grandchild care. However, none of these coefficients is statistically significant. The generally small and inconsistent correlations in Table 2 suggest that conclusive interpretations are impossible to be derived. Also, the opposite signs of regional effects compared to those at the country-level  hint   at  the importance of accounting for within-country variability in both prevalence of COVID-19 cases and IR indicators."
"41" "Within-country associations (8 European countries)"
"42" "We  examined within-country associations between COVID-19 cases and IR indicators for the 8 countries for which we have sub-national data. Table 3 reports correlation coefficients at the NUTS-2 level (except  for  Germany for which the NUTS-1 level  only  is available). The associations at the regional level display substantial differences across the considered countries. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient for living in multi-generational household ranges between –0.47 (Sweden, p<0.1) to +0.67 (Portugal, p<0.1). A negative association is also found for Spain, France, Poland, and Italy, although only for the latter country it is statistically significant (Spearman’s coefficient: -0.46; p<0.01). The correlation at the regional level between COVID-19 cases and geographic  proximity is negative for Switzerland, Sweden, Spain, France, and Italy (statistically significant at the 1% only for Spain and Italy) and positive for the other countries."
"43" "The frequency of contacts is negatively associated with COVID-19 cases at the regional level in Sweden, Portugal, Poland, and – particularly – in Italy (p < 0.001), but the association is positive in France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy (for daily contacts , p<0.001 ). Finally, the provision of grandchild care is positively correlated with COVID-19 cases for Italy, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, and Poland while both, Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlation coefficients are negative for Spain, France ,  and Portugal."
"44" "Within-country associations (Italy)"
"45" "Tables 4 and 5 reports weighted descriptive summary statistics of IR indicators and number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents for each region of Italy, sorted according to the  tertiles  of COVID-19 cases. In Table  4 , the IR indicators are calculated on the population 18+, while the 60+ has been considered in the construction of the indicators in Table  5 . In general, we observe a clear negative pattern of association between COVID-19 cases, geographic proximity and frequency of intergenerational contacts (in fact, darker cells corresponding to higher number of COVID-19 cases correspond, in general, lighter cells, i.e. lower values, for the IR indicators). However, an unclear pattern is found for the provision of grandchild care."
"46" "These associations have been formally tested and results are reported in Table 6. Findings strongly confirm evidence from SHARE data and display an even stronger negative  association  between  intergenerational co-residence and  geographic proximity  and  COVID-19 cases. These findings  a re consistently found also amongst individuals aged 60 + displaying a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of about -0.70 (p<0.001) with regard to co-residence and of about -0.60 (p<0.001) with regard to living close (within 16 km) to children and/or grandchildren. The frequency of contacts with children and grandchildren is also negatively associated with COVID-19 cases at the regional level, showing a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of about -0.56 and -0.61 (p<0.001). Again, consistently with the evidence drawn from the SHARE data, grandchild care provision at the regional level is positively correlated with COVID-19, cases although this coefficient is not statistically significant."
"47" "Conclusion and  D iscussion"
"48" "The aim of this  paper  was to critically discuss the role of intergenerational relationships  (IR)  in the spread of COVID-19, providing empirical evidence to counterargue that a higher impact  of the pandemic in some   areas  could be explained by more contact, proximity or functional solidarity (e.g., grandparental childcare) across generations within the family."
"49" "Notwithstanding positive associations between (most) IR indicators and COVID-19 cases at the country level, our  analyses have  largely   shown  opposite results at the sub-national level. We do not conclude from this that IRs negatively impact on the spread of COVID-19, but this evidence highlights the need for further investigation.  Because of the inconsistent results we obtained at  the  country -  and regional - level, we  thus  caution against over-interpretations of the empirical evidence on the association between  IR  and  the  spread of COVID-19."
"50" "There are two additional important aspects to consider that further suggest carefulness in this respect. First, when  analyzing  the effect of  IR  on COVID, one should take, as usual, confounding factors into account. At the country-level,  a positive  association may be spurious because intergenerational  contacts are more frequent   in  “weaker” welfare states  ( Künemund , 2008 )   where, for example, public health services tend to be  less available and/or  of lower quality. Similarly, at the regional level,  a negative association  between IR and COVID-19 cases  may be due to  the negative association between   IR   and the  prevalence of older people in nursing and care home , which have been found to have a crucial role in  the diffusion of  COVID-19  cases  ( Comas-Herrera  and   Zalakain , 2020 ).  An example  of this pattern is  the Lombard y region in Italy that, as showed  in  Table 4 , is  characterized  by  one of the highest  rate  of COVID-19 cases and by a  comparatively  low prevalence of intergenerational co-residence and contacts, and at the same time by a relatively high prevalence of older people living in care residences ( Pelliccia , 2017 )."
"51" "Other confounding factors may be represented by population density and level of commuting for job related reasons,  and social relationships other than IR  which have also been proposed as correlates of the prevalence of COVID-19 cases ( Harris, 2020; Mogi and  Spijker , 2020 ). These confounding factors may operate in various ways, affecting the link between  IR  and  COVID-19  cases , thus making any claim from simple unadjusted associations doubtful. The association between  IR  and spread of COVID-19 should therefore be  analyzed  at a fine r   geographic  level to allow accounting for confounding factors. Ideally, one should use individual data complemented with social network  information to examine the likelihood of COVID-19 infection as function of  IR  and other type of contact . Unfortunately, these data are not yet available and specific data collection efforts should be implemented in this direction to provide solid empirical evidence on this issue."
"52" "The “intergenerational contacts hypothesis” focuses on physical contacts and overlooks non-physical forms of  IR  that may help keeping the spread  of the virus  low. As emphasized by the multidimensional model of intergenerational solidarity (Bengtson and Roberts, 1991; Bengtson 2001),  IR  may take different forms, not all involving physical contacts (Albertini et al ,  2007 ;  Dykstra  and   Fokkema ,  2011 ;  Glaser et al ,  2004 ;  Tomassini et al ,  2004). For example, geographical proximity determines the possibility of providing some forms of instrumental support (e.g., help in cooking or cleaning) but not others (like online shopping in today’s digitalized world). Similarly, associational solidarity may include phone calls in digital form that are cheaper and offer the possibility of video interactions,  allowing  to manifest affect in a way that resembles physical contact ( Quadrello  2005; Peng et al. 2018)."
"53" "If IR are not limited to physical contacts, f rom a theoretical perspective, the association between  IR  and the spread of COVID-19 is  even less clear cut .   A wide array of studies has shown that  IR  are important for individuals’ health and well-being (e.g., Arpino  and  Bordone ,  2014 ;   Thoits ,  2011). Applying the theoretical arguments that were used to explain this evidence to the spread of COVID-19 one may even hypothesize a negative effect of  IR . For example, the social control perspective ( Umberson  et al, 2010) postulates that close family members are interested in preserving their kin in good health and to achieve this goal they exert pressure and control to inhibit family members’ unhealthy behaviors and to promote their positive habits. Thus, for example, children may  positively influence  their older parents  in  comply ing  with the measures taken by the Government and/or local authorities to contrast the spread of COVID-19."
"54" "Along this line, social-behavioral models of  IR  posit that, satisfying social norms of family obligations, family members provide help and support to each other, thus complementing the role of the welfare state (Antonucci et al 2007,  Carr  & Springer 2010, Cooney and Dykstra, 2011;  Marckmann , 2017; Silverstein & Bengtson 1991). In the time of COVID-19 pandemic, help provided by children (e.g. with (online) shopping) may aid older parents to stay  at home and reduce their exposure to the virus.  IR  are also an important source of emotional support, which reduce s  risk of depression and loneliness  ( Mansson , 2016 ).  This is another mechanism that may favor compliance with the  “physical distancing” rule: people who receive more emotional support at home, or  even at a distance (on the phone), may be less likely to go out to look for distractions and social contacts.   As  a side note, given the importance of non-physical interactions among humans we also suggest, as others did (e.g.,  Kumar, 2020 ), to replace the term “physical distancing” to “social distancing”."
"55" "All in all, we have shown that empirically the association between  IR  and the spread of COVID-19 is not robust. We also argued that different forms of  IR  may have contraposing effects.  Incorrect  conclusions on the effect of  IR  on COVID -19  are not innocuous because policy implications based on not solid evidence may be ineffective and counterproductive.  H elp provided by family members may result to be particularly needed and useful in adverse situations to buffer their negative impact on mental health ( Carr  et al, 2017;   Carr  2020).  Some s tudies  already  documented increased mental health problems during the COVID-19  pandemic  ( e.g.,  Brooks  et al, 2020 ). Thus,  IR  may be especially needed to cope with the stress caused by  the  restrictions and the climate of uncertainty in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Policies that fight against the spread  of COVID-19   and those oriented at the so-called “phase 2”, i.e. the post-emergency phase, need to take into account the importance of instrumental and emotional support guaranteed by  IR ,  which is particularly important  in some countries, and for older people."
