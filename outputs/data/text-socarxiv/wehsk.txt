Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic made it visceral for many that virtual forms of collaboration—
simultaneously liberating and frustrating—are here to stay. Workers’ frustrations demonstrate that
challenges remain for work designs in increasingly “hybrid” collaboration, wherein some people
work face-to-face with others who work remotely. Fortunately, Buchanan’s four orders of design
present a framework for improving virtual forms of collaboration in conjunction with management
and information systems scholarship. Here, we review the latest knowledge from these disciplines
on virtual collaboration through the lens of the four orders of design. In doing so, we demonstrate
that conceiving of work in terms of flexible collaborative environments could increase unity
between work and workers by leveraging the capabilities of varying degrees of virtuality toward
experiences that benefit all those who interact with work systems.

Introduction
Since the first industrial revolution, organizations have gathered workers together in common
locations. This process, called agglomeration,1 allowed organizations to share common energy
sources, tools, and goods among their employees, centralize logistics,2 and increase worker

supervision and control.3 But by the 1970s, the nature of work was evolving. Expanding use of the
telephone made “telecommuting” possible, meaning people could collaborate without physically
being together.4 Tasks became “increasingly ‘informated,’ turning a large proportion of corporate
employees at all ranks into ‘knowledge workers’ whose tasks are computer-mediated.”5 The need
to remain competitive drove organizations to acquire the best talent wherever those workers were
located, thereby guiding collaboration toward greater “virtuality”.6
The COVID-19 pandemic conspicuously accelerated this transition, shifting 35% of US
workers7 and 80% of global corporate remote work policies8 from primarily collocated and faceto-face interactions to virtual and hybrid forms of collaboration within a few weeks. Nor was this
sudden transition temporary. Nearly two-thirds (64%) of organizations report that “remote
working is a permanent change they have made due to COVID-19,” with a similar fraction (69%)
reporting that at least 75% of their workforce works effectively when remote9 consistent with longheld self-assessments showing the same.10 Increasingly, individuals and organizations see the
“liberating” potentials of distributed work as it grants them newfound flexibility.11
Simultaneously, millions of people struggle with “flexible” work arrangements. Even prior
to the pandemic, Information & Communication Technology (ICT) adoption frequently yielded
unintended or “dual” consequences,12 an effect that more people now experience with growing
hybridity. For example, while some people view Slack as a flexible lifeline amidst remote work
isolation, others find its incessant notifications insufferable.13 Or perhaps you may be familiar with
“Zoom fatigue.” Video conferencing certainly helps people stay connected with loved ones and
colleagues (in some cases the only time people saw others’ faces during the pandemic), yet the

experience of spending all day in video meetings often felt particularly exhausting, probably due
to increased cognitive load, self-evaluation, sensations of intimacy, and reduced mobility.14 Of
course, both of these examples assume a person has sufficient or consistent enough internet access
to collaborate remotely in the first place, a particularly challenging reality in many rural
communities and developing nations.
Reasonably then, numerous works15 demonstrate that users “appropriate new technology
by adapting it to meet their needs, which may or may not match designers’ goals,” even to the
point where they appropriate relationships, the roles of others, and even policies.16 At some level,
this process is both efficient and sufficient because users “make things work” for themselves. In
fact, Leonardi et al. suggest that “tailoring systems to meet user requirements may prove
impossible.” Particularly as problems become increasingly complex and user populations grow
“so diverse as to be incompletely definable,” it may prove more effective to let those in need
appropriate designs in distinct ways that work for themselves.17
That said, universal, inclusive, and feminist design advocates18 would argue (as we do) for
the necessity of at least working to include everyone to mitigate inequity, an outcome most likely
borne by marginalized groups. Indeed, Buchanan points out that the principle underlying
approaches like design thinking and its growing appeal to organizations is “quality of experience
for all those served by the organization.”19 For that and other reasons, organization scholars have
long called for the redesign of the work systems that affect us all,20 the systems of
interdependencies between tasks, processes, knowledge, skills, and technologies that organizations
require to accomplish their goals.21 The challenges, then, of redesigning collaboration “are not

problems of action but of reaching a new understanding of the purposes and ends,” 22 namely
addressing the needs of all stakeholders.
Fortunately, two bodies of work hold potential to address the conundrum of hybrid
collaboration. The first is Buchanan’s work on the four orders of design—symbols, things, actions,
and environments23—which describes a trend long underway, moving beyond the design of objects
or tools and into the design of interaction and environments. But for hybrid work specifically, the
last 10 years have also seen a consolidation of knowledge by scholars of management,
organizational communication, information systems, and psychology about numerous aspects of
remote work, from cultural preferences for technologies to classic notions of team performance.
Hence, by reviewing the last decade of literature reviews on virtual collaboration through
the lens of the four orders of design, this article proposes that designing work systems as flexible
collaborative environments will increase the likelihood of producing more equitable outcomes for
organizations’ stakeholders. To that end, the following sections detail the four orders of design
and virtual technology implementations before describing our review methodology. Then, we
present the thematic outcomes of the analysis, discuss them through the lens of the four orders of
design, and their implications for the future of technologies, physical and virtual workspaces, and
even organizational cultures. As a result, flexible collaborative environments could leverage the
benefits of varying degrees of virtuality to make work systems more satisfying for all those who
interact with them.

The Four Orders of Design and Their Intersections
Uncovering the foundations of design has proven challenging, and consequently, scholars have
framed its means and objectives differently over time.24 Some approach design as a science of
considering “possible worlds” and selecting from among the set of alternatives, whether for objects
or organizations;25 others see it as making sense of chaos by distilling simplicity from
complexity;26 others still as efficient communication toward behavior modification;27 and even as
a means of effecting change in the world.28 Of course, all of these are accurate in different ways
and contexts, regardless of their somewhat disjointed appearance.

But part of the value of denoting the four “orders” of design is in dialectically unifying
these framings. Though the names have subtly varied over time, their substances remain largely
the same: the first order of design involves symbols, the essence of communication. Symbols take
many forms; language, images, and behaviors all convey symbolic meanings.29 But classically,
this order describes disciplines like graphic design, audio, video, and communication professions.
Second is the order of things or objects, whether statuary, furnishings, vehicles, electronics,
software, etc. Industrial and product design certainly pervade, though so too do engineers and
artists of all flavors, craftspeople, and marketers, among others. The first two orders clearly overlap
in that objects often serve symbolic purposes, as with a child’s favorite toy or a tote bag that
advertises support for your local radio station, and potentially an identity that you seek to portray.
The third order is that of action and interaction, which brings us to present notions of the design
of user experiences (with technologies and other people), services, and processes. We might
consider a business consultant who designs new processes (or streamlines the old). Here, too, our
consultant’s new process likely involves interacting with some kind of information technology on
a designed device, the relevance of which would increase if the process manipulated customized
manufacturing processes or, say, open office workspaces.
Which brings us to the fourth order, environments or systems. Interestingly, Buchanan
further specifies that these are environments “for living, working, playing, and learning,” each of
which underscores the unity of purpose or thought guiding a particular environment’s design.30
This order naturally lends itself to professions of built environments—architecture, urban
planning, interior design—but also to professions of designed missions that draw more from the
systems metaphor—systems engineering, organization design, and public policy among others.31
As with the former orders, the fourth often integrates the first three and likewise can be integrated
into them, too. A public health initiative, for example, may involve the development of
recognizable symbols, the construction of personal protective equipment, and the administration
of vaccines, all oriented toward a unified mission of community well-being. Or serve as a symbol
of worthiness for reelection. Or both, depending on the “possible world” each individual inhabits.32
Similarly, we can apply this logic to systems of virtual work. First, we need a language for
discussing some attributes of virtual work.

The “system” metaphor makes an important contribution even as it is interchangeable with the “environment”
metaphor because it allows us to move beyond a grounding in material space and into a grounding in relationships
between artifacts of any kind, material or not.

Terminology of Virtual Collaboration
Whether our teams are collocated in the same office, distributed around the globe, or a hybrid mix
of the two varying by the day,33 information and communication technologies (ICTs) play
substantive roles in most present-day work designs. ICTs have significantly evolved in recent years
with the additions of team chat, blogs, wikis, and more recently video calling, audio processing,
computer vision, and natural language processing among many others. Technologies result in
differing amounts of team virtuality, “the extent and value of utilizing information and
communication technologies within work teams,”34 where value refers to the richness of the
informational content provided by ICTs such as via its synchronicity or asynchronicity. Exemplary
of this, integrating videoconferencing into team interactions tends to result in lower team virtuality
due to its communication synchronicity and relatively rich content, as compared to email which
tends toward higher asynchronicity and lower informational quality. Virtuality produces mixed
results for team performance, learning, adaptation, satisfaction, trust, and identity depending on
team member skills, authority structure, and how long the team has been together to name a few.35
Furthermore, the continual evolution of teams through varying configurations of remote work
yields different experiences for different teams at different times.
Information systems research also examines how teams accomplish outcomes with
technology through understanding the interrelated contributions of the technical artifact and the
social behaviors of people. This theoretical lens, known as materiality, asserts that while users of
technologies exercise some discretion over how technologies affect their work, technologies both
promote and constrain certain activities based on the properties of the designed artifact36 (here, an
object shapes interaction, and perhaps interactions shape interactions). Rice and Leonardi
summarize how organizations adopt, use, and benefit from ICTs. Influences that increase adoption
may come from “individual (e.g., innovativeness and self-efficacy), social (e.g. influence), and
institutional (e.g. top management commitment) contexts.”37
This resonates with the experiences of millions of individuals during the pandemic;
outcomes depend largely on the specific technology, implementation, and social use of that
technology. Conflict can result from disruption of organizational structures, work processes,
differences in geography, culture, professionalism, and interaction frequency. Readers can likely

recall instances of many of these in their own careers. At the same time, a team or organization’s
network may expand from ICT use, as with professional social media sites, though information
overload can similarly dampen the benefits of this outcome.
These myriad experiences bring us back to Buchanan. Our current work systems do yield
outcomes of both individual and collective good; neither individuals nor organizations would hail
their benefits otherwise! And still, “if the purpose of design thinking is to create the environments
within which we live [and work], the purpose is also to make possible the unity of the individual
with the environments that human beings create.” Whether caused by “practical,” “intellectual,”
or “emotional” dissatisfaction, “the felt unity of an experience is broken, trust and confidence are
diminished, and human satisfaction in the fulfillment of reaching a goal is lost.”38
Therefore, work as we know it only partially “works.” To understand why, the remainder
of this piece reviews the established knowledge on virtual collaboration through the four orders.
As we will see, hybrid work systems need to accommodate individuals and teams alike, flexibly
and simultaneously to fully facilitate unity. But, in so doing, they may also create opportunities
not currently afforded to existing work systems.

Review Methodology
For this work, we conducted a “review of reviews,” known in the information systems literature
as an umbrella review or an overview of reviews, following the procedure outlined in Templier &
Paré.39 We searched all 41 databases included in ABI/INFORM on ProQuest for reviews that
describe accepted knowledge about virtual work. We did this by searching for explicit review
articles, meaning the work self-identified as a review or meta-analysis of virtual, hybrid,
distributed, or remote aspects of work, collaboration, teams, or groups.40
We screened for article quality by performing this search within the Association of
Information Systems’ “basket of eight” journals (European Journal of Information Systems,
Information Systems Journal, Information Systems Research, Journal of AIS, Journal of
Information Technology, Journal of MIS, Journal of Strategic Information Systems, and MIS
Quarterly) in addition to eight top Management journals (Academy of Management Review,
Academy of Management Journal, Organization Science, Management Science, Organizational
Behavior and Human Decision Processes, Administrative Science Quarterly, Human Resource
Management Review, and Journal of Management) and two relevant Organizational Psychology
journals (Journal of Applied Psychology and Small Group Research). We also limited the search
to the years 2010-2020 to ensure our findings represented the most up-to-date knowledge from the
field while allowing time for studies of different perspectives to accrue. Collectively, these

returned 30 unique articles. We then excluded articles which did not self-identify as reviews or
meta-analyses (for example, Human Resource Management Review yielded several false positives
due to the journal name) or reviewed an adjacent topic41 leaving 13 studies (see Table 1), eight of
which hailed from a Human Resources Management Review special issue on virtual teams from
2017. Lastly, given our interest in the design of hybrid work arrangements, we limited our review
to findings within virtual professional contexts by excluding any findings from purely collocated
settings.42
Within the 13 studies, then, we recorded the theme identified by the authors; associated the
factors of each finding as inputs, moderators, mediators, or outputs; noted its association with
individuals, leaders, teams, or organizations; and the relationship between factors as positivelyrelated, negatively-related, having mixed effects, or no effect. Many of the inductive thematic
reviews cited findings with only one study supporting the finding, so only findings with multiple
supporting studies were included to ensure claim validation. For instances in which the object of
study was not specified, the party enacting or affected by a given practice was inferred from
context. Furthermore, statements about generic “effects” were designated as having “mixed
effects” on a generic “outcomes” specification. Following the compilation of these findings, we
inductively coded the findings identified within each study, partially informed by the authoridentified thematic categories. As will quickly become apparent, a significant majority of the
findings involve preferences and attributes that we might classify as third-order and fourth-order,
but also involving nearly ubiquitous variation.

Table 1: The 13 review articles included in the umbrella review. Included are the authors, years of publication, review
titles, publication titles, the type of reviews (either thematic inductive or meta-analytic), and the terminology identified
by the search criteria. Articles are presented in alphabetical order by lead author.

Results: Hybrid Collaborations as Environments
Following the procedure described in the previous section, we identified a total of 243 claims made
across the reviews that satisfied the specified criteria. An inductive coding process distilled these
findings into 14 themes which we gathered into four categories, summarized in Table 2 with the
number of articles and the total number of claims displayed for each category and theme. Of
course, many of these claims are redundant with one another because different reviews frequently
refer to the same articles; hence, these quantities metaphorically represent the relative attention
paid to each topic (within and across disciplines) and the abundance of nuance within each
category rather than the importance of each. Also, themes can and do apply to multiple categories,
but we chose an organization into personality traits, task expectations, task resources, and team

Personality Traits & Virtuality
Projects often start by constructing teams. A review by Hoch & Dulebohn43 provides, to the best
of our knowledge, a unique synthesis of organizational psychology literature describing the
relationships between the “big five” personality dimensions (extraversion, agreeableness,
conscientiousness, openness, and emotional stability) and leadership in virtual teams.
With respect to individuals, all five traits correlate with increased likelihood of that person
emerging as a leader, and individual leadership emergence correlates with team performance. With
respect to team composition, relationships become more mixed. Several qualities
(conscientiousness, agreeableness, emotional stability) are positively correlated with shared
leadership and team performance, while others (extraversion and openness) have mixed effects on
both shared leadership and team performance. Increasing virtuality is positively related to the
likelihood that leadership will emerge and that the team will share leadership in all but cases
wherein the team scores highly on agreeableness, which tends more toward shared leadership.
Returning to team design, a manager might approach the formation of a team with a
unifying thought of how to pursue a goal. We can assume managers and organizations may have
some control over the personality composition of their teams contingent on other constraints, but
only some control. People have unique identities with varying degrees of each quality, if people
are even reducible in five traits, so we cannot assume that every manager (or any manager) can
form “optimal” team compositions. Nevertheless, the result of forming a team is designing a
human system, an environment of interacting identities,44 with unique values and interests,
embodied in the people we work with toward goal-attainment.
Task Expectations
Gradually, teams construct explicit and tacit expectations.45 In virtual teams, those expectations
can include anything from roles and responsibilities, to social norms, to government regulations.
The several reviews that discuss this topic46 tend to describe what we might call incentives or job
demands and how those limitations and subsequent rewards shape outcomes. The majority of the
findings relate to teams, but also to individual well-being and organizational outcomes.

Beginning with individuals, constraints on one’s job (e.g. time, role ambiguity) tend to
somewhat decrease functioning, but yield mixed effects depending on the kind of constraint
(virtually is more constraining with short-term projects than long, for example). Likewise mixed
effects exist with respect to well-being and varying amounts of virtuality.47 In terms of team
constructs such as task non-routineness and rewards, mixed-incentives (that is, rewards at both the
individual and group levels) are positively related to individual well-being while improving team
performance.48 Problem-solving demands (like difficulty) yield mixed results for performance,
additionally so when moderated by virtuality, though both decrease performance and trust on
average. Perhaps surprising to some, how unique or non-routine a task is can decrease trust in a
team.49
Legal frameworks increasingly prove relevant as teams become more global, often
resulting in uncertainty for virtual teams because of the relative recency of virtual collaboration
compared to legal timescales.50 COVID-19 brought this issue to the fore as workers who
previously commuted across borders began working full time in different tax jurisdictions.
National and transnational laws shape labor standards, safety, compensation, freedom from
discrimination, etc. Organizations also establish “private law” that can affect workers’ rights and
obligations, such as through contracts and adoption of international standards, thereby raising
questions of legal statuses of virtual and hybrid employees and employers depending on the
borders one crosses. Thus far, “countries have not significantly adapted their approach to
determining the legal status of a [hybrid] worker as an employee” resulting in “significant
ambiguity.”51
Returning to the orders, think of incentives as objects to achieve and avoid that shape the
processes (actions and interactions) that individuals and teams design toward goal-attainment,
even as they can also serve symbolic purposes for organizations. Likewise, legal constructs serve
symbolic, objective, and procedural purposes. How effectively those objects of achievement draw
in, and those objects of avoidance deter, will depend on the alignment between the incentive
environments of teams,52 but also of individuals, organizations, and governments among
environments both internal and external to a team.
Task Resources
Teams draw on resources to perform tasks and achieve their goals. Resources are “aspects of the
job that help achieve work goals, reduce demands, or promote growth from the job demands–

resources model of work design.”53 So while materials qualify, so too will teams make use of
information, social networks, skills, tools, etc.
Perhaps the most (superficially) intuitive resource in virtual work is technology. Harking
back to materiality, different technologies have different effects on both individual and team
outcomes, further depending on the context in which the tool is used and the user’s experience
with the tool, though organizations can sometimes supplement experience with training.54
Specifically referring to ICTs, those technologies are related to numerous individual-level
outcomes including some improvements (reduced social loafing, increased perceptions of leader
competence and satisfaction) and some degradations (decreased perceptions of productivity,
decreased extrarole activity, and increased decision time),55 though again to varying extents among
many other instances of virtuality moderation.
Information, too, plays important roles albeit with various effects; having access to more
information can produce positive or negative outcomes, though certain kinds, like feedback about
processes and outcomes, tend to correlate with improved team functioning56 while others, say a
person’s knowledge sharing abilities, correlate with decreased social network development.57
Combined, even resources tell increasingly nuanced pictures through concepts like
materiality. The choices involved in constructing a team’s virtuality extend beyond the secondorder, they predicate team processes through which people exchange information in a web of
exchanges that leave us with a combined virtual-material, informated environment encompassing
all of our genres of communication in hybrid configurations along with the tools of knowledge
work. One major resource is obviously missing here: “the team” also serves as a resource. We
consider its myriad interactions next.
Team Interaction
Teams play such important roles in current work designs that we practically take their existences
for granted. Unequivocally, they are incredibly complex.58 Our review identified eight themes that
naturally coalesce within virtual team interaction: communication, conflict, culture, leadership,
task interdependence, team building, and team cognition. We address three themes here briefly
because in most cases, each theme is laden with a mix of positive and negative relationships,
mediators, and moderators as demonstrated by the relationship fractions shown in Table 2.

The research on communication describes relationships between individual- and teamlevel inputs (e.g. frequency, timeliness, virtuality, skill level), through numerous mediators (e.g.
uniqueness, openness, privacy, temporal stability, authority, virtuality), to individual- and teamlevel outputs (e.g. performance, trust, satisfaction, innovation, identity), and moderated by other
constructs (e.g. virtuality, task complexity, skill).59 Of the relationships, 50% identify positive
relationships between the input and output, 32% negative, and 18% mediate relationships
reinforcing the significant nuance.
Next, much of the culture research considers diversity based on geographic dispersion or
national origin.60 Kramer et al. conduct another unique review of cultural typologies including
Hofstede’s cultural dimensions, Triandis’ cultural typology, Trompenaars’ cultural differences,
high-low context cultures, and tight vs. loose cultures.61 Several also consider topics of subgroup
formation, language barriers, and workplace harassment.62 Each of these cultures are then related
to greatly varied outcomes including more pervasive constructs (e.g. team performance) but more
often culture-relevant outcomes (e.g. team identification, tool preference by culture, coordination
difficulty, subgroup formation, conflict). Here, 70% of the findings describe positive relationships
between the input and output, 18% negative, and 8% mixed effects. Many of the positive items
describe cultural preferences for high or low tool synchronicity, compliance with authority’s
choices, and reliance on virtual tools. Collectively, these again demonstrate that a “one size fits
all” work design is unlikely to prove fruitful.
Finally, we consider trust, one of the most widely studied topics in virtual teams which has
consistently resulted in mixed findings.63 Initially, many of the findings seem intuitive: team trust
is positively correlated with performance and likewise between individual trust and increased
communication. But particular communicative behaviors reveal mixed relations to team trust,

again adding nuance even as qualities like building trust early, positive tone, and knowledge
sharing are positively related to building “swift trust” in shorter-term teams.
To repeat, these samples from communication, culture, and trust merely provide a subset
of the complexity imbuing team interaction. Concurrently, they call into question the notion of a
singular design as team environments, human systems of interaction, necessarily involve
heterogeneous identities, incentives, and information. Next, we address the challenge advancing
toward work systems that achieve unity between its environments.

Discussion
Multiple systems of work artifacts pervade virtual collaboration. Our understanding of work
systems grows more complex as we frame environments of identities, incentives, information, and
others as interacting, “nested within another and another, stretching all of the way from the goods
and services provided to the customer to the top of organizational leadership,” as Buchanan
similarly remarks about organizational culture.64 Organizational culture is a socially-constructed
environment; here we have described hybrid collaboration as overlapping sociotechnical, coconstructed environments, collectively forming a hybrid work environment in which humans
shape humans, shape technology, shape humans.
Work environments cannot be static, singular constructs if we seek to achieve unity with
heterogeneous stakeholders. That said, adopting plural designs would expect minorities of all kinds
to assimilate into dominant norms and likely will not create unity either. Instead, according to
Nishii, “the key to moving from a plural organization to an inclusive one is to alter the
sociorelational context[, the environment] within which heterogeneous individuals interact.” So
we must strive for work systems that are flexible enough to facilitate personalization,65 purposively
designing in ways to appropriate, if you will. This reorientation is a logical outgrowth of various
research streams on structural flexibility,66 digital innovation,67 flexible technologies,68 and
organization design69 among others.70 Therefore, we propose that work systems designed as

flexible collaborative environments will be more likely to approach unity between work, worker,
team, and organization. Crucially, these hybrid environments would need to involve participatory
co-creation with workers because while “gig work” is becoming pervasive, it tends to achieve
organizational flexibility at the expense of workers rather than empowering them to substantively
co-create personalized work systems.71
To some extent, we already see organizations trending toward “unifying” environments
with the adoption of products like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and GSuite which tout their abilities to
streamline team processes through a central hub often located “in the cloud.” But even purposebuilt platforms often fail to address objectives of unity.72 These largely normative platforms’
singular and plural designs evidently yield mixed results and hence less unity, thereby sustaining
a need for more flexible environments.
Given our review, designers and researchers can prioritize identifying means of
constructing flexibility in terms of the themes we identify in Table 2 as a starting point. Take the
intersection of communication, virtuality, and technology for example. Many of today’s video
technologies visually and auditorily place speakers and non-speakers in ways that prioritize
extraversion73 and likely yield to Zoom fatigue.74 Some research explores constructing entirely
virtual three-dimensional environments as solutions,75 though these experiences remain
bandwidth-intensive and buggy at present.76
Despite its relatively-low virtuality, even video communication involves numerous forms
of “noise” that materially shape the symbolic meanings we glean from one another. Are there ways

to use computer vision, audio processing, and natural language processing to build in additional
flexibility for both collocated and remote workers? Videoconferencing software has already begun
to address background noise in real time77 granting more flexibility to working parents with
children at home, while live speech synthesis may provide transcription that facilitates greater
accessibility; possibilities for overcoming audio and video garbling through reduced bandwidth
requirements; for inferring employee satisfaction; and for collecting data that describes work
patterns as social networks. These relatively novel forms of data collection could help managers
identify network connections beneficial to individuals and teams as social network sites do, and
perhaps new organizational structures.
A caution, though; that is not to say that any of these are necessarily “better.” Materiality
acknowledges trade-offs along with potential benefits, in this case including automating-away
historically devalued actions like recordkeeping, increased computing needs, and privacy
concerns. Nevertheless, by designing such work environments for flexible interaction—integrating
symbols, objects, and actions—we may still provide workers with the customizability to
experiment with solutions that appeal to their unique social, technical, and legal positionalities.
To be clear, this opportunity extends beyond recreating yesterday’s work systems. Instead,
designers will provide the greatest value by working interdisciplinarily with researchers and
practitioners, managers and gig workers, to understand the underlying fundamental objectives of
work and thinking broadly about how to achieve those objectives, from psychologically safe and
inclusive cultures to innovation.78 Pandemic lockdowns exposed that many people missed the
opportunity to build relationships with colleagues, develop shared culture, and find fundamental
value in the depths and breadths of human connection afforded by the action of doing work with
others. Incorporating the situated knowledge of individuals and collectives will prove necessary
for our new work systems to stand the test of time. Better yet, it may capitalize on a plethora of
novel hybrid capabilities toward greater flexibility for all.
Countless possibilities remain. In reading this piece, the reader may have recalled
experiences of their own which went surprisingly poorly, or surprisingly well. Growing
accustomed to the challenges of hybrid work does not innately justify its perpetuation. But with
all of their liberations and frustrations, pandemic-necessitated changes generated many an impetus
to develop prototypes of flexible environments for hybrid collaboration. Informed by the
pandemic, from here on, we can proceed intentionally toward a thought of unity between
heterogeneous work, workers, teams, organizations, and a more satisfying future for all.
