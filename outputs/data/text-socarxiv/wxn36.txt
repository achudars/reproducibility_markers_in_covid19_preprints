Abstract
This study investigates the effects of COVID-19 on English as a foreign language (EFL)
learners' anxiety at the University of Bisha, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The differences between
male and female learners and learners of the different study levels in terms of anxiety caused by
COVID-19 were investigated. Moreover, the study sheds light on two factors which are the
internal factors and external factors that increase learning anxiety during COVID-19 and the
strategies used by the learners to decrease the negative effects of COVID-19 on learning anxiety.
The data of the study were collected from 80 EFL learners (40 males and 40 females) at the
University of Bisha. This study is considerable as it deals with something that is important in the
learning and teaching processes these days. The study revealed that COVID-19 causes normal
anxiety to the EFL learners at the University of Bisha. It was also revealed that there is no
significant difference between the male and female learners in terms of anxiety caused by
COVID-19 and external factors. There is a significant difference between them in terms of the
internal factors and strategies used by the learners to decrease the negative effects of learning
anxiety during COVID-19. Lastly, there was no significant difference between the learners of the
different study levels in terms of anxiety, internal factors and external factors that increase
negative learning anxiety and the strategies used by the learners to decrease the negative learning
anxiety during COVID-19.

Introduction
The current era is witnessing several effects and a necessary change in the education
system due to the spread of COVID-19, which shifted education from offline education to online
education on educational teaching platforms. These effects and changes have caused
unbelievable disruption not only in the educational system but also to many several sectors like
business, and commerce, tourism, etc. UNESCO (2020) has declared that over “60% of the
world’s student population” have been affected because of the effects and changes of Covid-19
on the education system. Also, “Never before have we witnessed educational disruption on such
a large scale” declared by UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay (cited in Demuyakor,
2020, p. 133). Till now, there is still a dim view of this battle with Covid-19. Governments
worldwide are still uncertain about when regular classroom teaching will go in its standard
system. Consequently, the schools and universities are now emphasizing online instruction with
all possible means of education and technology. There has been a remarkable surge in the usage
of various online teaching and learning platforms (Li & Lalani, 2020).On the other side, COVID19 has incredible effects on learners’ anxiety who are learning English as a foreign language
through these teaching platforms and educational technology. Therefore, this study attempts to
investigate the effects of COVID-19 on Saudi EFL learners during this pandemic, with hopes to
have a significant contribution in this field.
Rationale, significance and questions of the study
As learning anxiety has an essential role in learning second or foreign language, and as
COVID-19 is a new pandemic that causes anxiety, there is a need to examine this problem. In
KSA, there have been no more studies on learning anxiety caused by COVID-19. So, this study
will undoubtedly provide the decision-makers with some vital information and help them know
the details of the problem and make decisions accordingly.
The current study tries to answer the following research questions:
- To what extent does COVID-19 cause anxiety on EFL learners at the University of Bisha?
- What are the effects of COVID-19 on EFL learners' anxiety at the University of Bisha?
- Is there any significant difference between male and female learners and the learners of the
different levels in terms of:
• Learning anxiety caused by Covid-19?
• Internal factors that increase negative anxiety of COVID-19?
• External factors that increase negative anxiety of COVID-19?
• Strategies used by EFL learners to decrease or overcome negative anxiety caused by
COVID-19?
Objectives of the study
As the title of the study suggests, the general objective of the study is to investigate the
effects of COVID-19 on learning anxiety. The study also aims to find:
- To what extent COVID-19 causes learning anxiety, particularly that of EFL learning.
- The differences between the male and female EFL learners in terms of learning anxiety caused
by COVID-19.
- The internal and external factors that increase the negative effects of anxiety.
- The strategies used by the EFL learners to overcome the negative effects of anxiety caused by
COVID-19 in EFL learning.

The Effects of COVID-19 on EFL Learners’ Anxiety

Literature Review
Since the early beginning of 2020, Saudi universities have been experiencing an
exceptional massive “Shifting” from the normal classes that are face-to-face classes to online
classes due to the extensive spread of Coronavirus disease COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia and other
parts of the world. During this time, many studies and researches have investigated the effects
and the changes that COVID-19 led to the education system. Moreover, in the following
paragraphs, the researchers will discuss few of the studies relevant to the effects and changes of
COVID-19on learners’ anxiety and the other psychological aspects.
The effects and changes caused by COVID-19 not only affected both learners’ strategies
and primacies but also their level of concern in joining courses online. Also, while some learners
have indicated that they were having good experience with the online classes, whereas others
have said that they are facing negative experiences while returning home during the COVID-19
in disturbed family situations (Killian, 2020).
Furthermore, several studies have stated that the psychological impact of COVID-19 such
as anxiety, fear, depression, anger, and confusion, etc, have affected many learners especially in
the initial stage of COVID-19 outbreak in China (Chew, Wei, Vasoo, Chua & Sim, 2020; Li,
Wang, Xue, Zhao & Zhu, 2020; Qiu, Shen, Zhao, Wang, Xie & Xu, 2020; Wang, Pan, Wan,
Tan, Xu, Ho & Ho, 2020). Similar results of these studies were always noted in studies by (Cao,
Fang, Hou, Han, Xu, Dong & Zheng, 2020; Wang & Zhao, 2020) that college learners have
experienced many levels of psychological stress, health anxiety and depression.
Another study by Arënliu and Bërxulli (2020) investigated the psychological distress of
the COVID-19 on learners belonging to different departments. The study revealed that 11.4 % of
the learners said that they face very abnormal psychological distress, 13.3% said temperate
psychological distress, 24.7 % stated slight psychological distress, whereas 50.6% did not state
any psychological distress.
Wang and Zhao (2020) elaborated the early effects of the COVID-19 including its effects
on anxiety and stress; these effects were related to some factors like home restrictions and health
concerns. Among other factors, they reported that learners underwent extra stress, anxiety, and
sadness than those who are not learners. Numerous researchers have expected that physical
distancing and universal anxiety feelings over the COVID-19 have originated a wide-ranging
collection of effects and challenges in classes together with poor academic presentation (Rundle,
Park, Herbstman, Kinsey & Wang, 2020; Sintema, 2020; Van Lancker & Parolin, 2020).
In the Saudi context, Moawad (2020) explored the effects of stress on online learning
among Saudi university learners. The researcher carried out his exploration on 2271 male and
female learners at King Saud University. He observed that a total of 514 learners were fearful of
the sudden shift from the old-style face-to-face classes to online classes. They were scared of
exams, homework, internet connectivity, lecture timing, etc. Furthermore, Rahman (2020)
conducted a research on the various challenges of online EFL teaching during COVID-19 at
Qassim University. His study revealed that there were promising results in online EFL teaching
during COVID-19 at Qassim University. On the other side, there were some discrepancies. The
study concluded that during the quarantine, online teaching had repaired some of the damages to

education caused by COVID-19. However, questions remain unanswered regarding whether
online EFL teaching can meet the learners’ needs and desired goals.
Another study in Saudi EFL context by Mahyoob (2020) investigated the online learning
challenges and problems during COVID-19 faced by EFL learners at Taibah University. The
study revealed that learners faced difficulties in accessing the Blackboard platform. Further,
around 30% of the learners could not attend the classes and other assignments using Blackboard,
and they moved to other applications during online learning. Moreover, there were significant
challenges like technical issues faced by the EFL learners. Finally, it is revealed that the EFL
learners’ satisfaction with online learning is low (less than 50%) and “and 43 % of learners are not
fully supporting continuing online education if there is no crisis” (Mahyoob, 2020, p. 360).
Despite the hard work of these previous studies on the effects and challenges of COVID19 and on learners’ anxiety, there is still no vast of studies conducted mainly on investigating the
effects of COVID-19 on EFL learners’ anxiety at the Saudi universities. Therefore, this study is
conducted to investigate the effects of COVID-19 on Saudi EFL learners’ anxiety.
Method
This study is a cross-sectional study that was conducted in 2020, i.e. during COVID-19
pandemic. A questionnaire was designed to collect demographic information and data from
respondents about learning anxiety caused by COVID-19. The questionnaire was reviewed by
some experts in questionnaire designing and statistical analysis. Their feedback led to some
changes in the questionnaire and a pilot study was suggested to be done. The pilot study was
conducted on 30 learners and some modifications were made.
The questionnaire was distributed among the undergraduate learners of the Department of
English at the University of Bisha as a Google form in December 2020. After collecting the data,
the data were inserted into SPSS (Version 22.0) for analysis. The tools that were used in the
analysis were descriptive statistics, One-Way ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis H test.
Participants
Eighty respondents of the EFL learners at the University of Bisha were taken randomly
out of 98 respondents. Eighteen female respondents were dropped out of the study because the
researchers intended to take the male and female learners' respondents equally as the gender
factor is essential in this study. Forty male learners and forty female learners were taken for the
study. All the participants are Saudi citizens. Their ages are nearly ranged between 18 years and
26 years. They have almost the same educational background living accommodations.
Instruments
In this study a questionnaire was used to collect the data. The final version of the
distributed questionnaire was of two sections. The first section intended to elicit demographic
information (profile) of the respondents. The second section that is of 20 items of 5-point Likert
scale ranging 'strongly agree' to 'strongly disagree' intended to elicit data from the respondents
about their learning anxiety caused by COVID-19, the internal factors that increase their learning
anxiety, the external factors that increase their learning anxiety and the strategies that they use to
decrease the negative effects of anxiety on their language learning.

It was found that the respondents have anxiety and fear about their learning during
COVID-19 but it is noticed that this anxiety does not decrease their ability to learn. The results
show, as shown in Table three, that the means of four statements related to anxiety were above
(3.5), the mean of the statement that elicited information about whether COVID-19 anxiety
decreases the learners' ability to learn or not was (2.33). This means that most EFL learners have
a belief that COVID-19 anxiety does not decrease their ability to learn.

the male and female learners on the level of anxiety (P = .597 < .05). The analysis of the
statement "I worry that COVID-19 may prevent me from learning English" shows a significant
difference between the male and female learners(P= .017, > .05). As there is a significant
difference between the male and female learners in the statement, Kruskal Wallis H test was used

Internal Factors That Increase the Learners' Negative Anxiety about Learning during Covid19
The internal factors that may increase the learners' negative anxiety towards learning
during COVID-19 were also considered and tested. Table six reveals that there was an agreement
that the internal factors play a role in increasing the negative anxiety of COVID-19 towards EFL
learning (Mean = 2.93).

Using Kruskal Wallis H test to calculate the mean ranks, as shown in Table (8),it was found that,
during COVID-19, the female learners' learning anxiety is increased by internal factors more
than that of the male learners.

External Factors That Increase the Learners' Negative Anxiety towards Learning during
Covid-19
The external factors that may increase the learners' negative anxiety towards learning
during COVID-19 were considered and tested in this study. As shown in Table (10), the mean of
the respondents' responses is 3.76. This indicates that the external factors play a critical role in
increasing the learners' anxiety about their learning during COVID-19. The external factors that
play such role are like hearing and reading about COVID-19, seeing the preventive measures and
social media news. These factors prove negative effects on the learners' anxiety towards EFL
learning.

The Effects of COVID-19 on EFL Learners’ Anxiety

Mohammed & Mudhsh

Strategies Used by EFL Learners to Overcome/Decrease the Negative Learning Anxiety
Caused by Covid-19
As there are anxiety, internal factors and external factors that increase anxiety, there is a
response by the learners. The reaction is using a strategy to decrease the negative effects of such
anxiety. When testing the strategies used by the EFL learners and analyzing the results, it was
found that there is an agreement that the learners use strategies like “enthusing themselves to
learn”, ''ignoring social media news about COVID-19", "trying to be hopeful and cheerful during
COVID-19", etc. to decrease the negative effects of internal and external factors that increase
their anxiety and fear about learning during COVID-19. As shown in Table (13), there is a
significant difference between the male and female learners in using the strategies to decrease the
effects of COVID-19 anxiety on their EFL learning(P = .004). Using Kruskal Wallis H test to
calculate the mean ranks, it was found, as shown in Table (14), that the female learners use more
strategies than male learners to decrease the negative effects of learning anxiety caused by
Covid-19. Only one strategy is used more by male learners than female learners that is "trying to
be hopeful and cheerful during COVID-19 to continue learning".

The Effects of COVID-19 on EFL Learners’ Anxiety

Mohammed & Mudhsh

Discussion
This study found that the EFL learners have learning anxiety caused by COVID-19
pandemic. This seems to be normal among the learners. They are anxious about their study. It is
normal that they have "fear of academic year loss"(Hasan & Bao, 2020, p. 1). This seems to be
normal among the learners. This goes in line with many studies (Sundarasen et al., 2020) that
found 92% of 983 respondents had normal anxiety and like (Aqeel, Shuja, Abbas, Rehna, &
Ziapour, 2020) that found 77.3% of the respondents had normal, mild and moderate anxiety and
22.7% had severe level of anxiety.
Although it was found that there is no significant difference between male and female
learners in terms of anxiety caused by COVID-19, there seems to be tendency to present higher
levels of anxiety by female learners than male learners. Silva, Brito and Pereira (2020) found that
"female participants (M= 2.59,SD= .81) presented higher levels of anxiety regarding COVID-19
than men (M=2.21,SD=.77)." (p. 4)
It was found that external factors play a role in increasing the negative effects of anxiety
caused by COVID-19. These results are aligned with the results of (Martínez-Lorca, MartínezLorca, Criado-Álvarez, & Armesilla, 2020) and other studies. That is why WHO suggested
"minimize watching, reading or listening to news that cause you feel anxious or distressed"
(World Health Organization, 2020, p. 1). Not only external factors have negative effects on
learning anxiety but also internal factors have negative effects in increasing learning anxiety.
This was proved by Sood. S. (2020). This was stated as "The swift rise of fear and anxiety
among people due to uncertainty of the disease are coupled with essential yet socially disruptive
measures like lockdowns and quarantines. ...These can lead to ... anxiety. Predisposing factors
include ... misinformation on social media". (Sood, S. 2020, p. 23).
The EFL learners use some strategies to decrease the negative effects of learning anxiety
caused by COVID-19. As it was found that the female learners are in general more anxious about
their learning than male learners, it was found that they use more strategies to diminish or reduce
the negative effects of anxiety caused by COVID-19.
Conclusion
It is noticed and proved that anxiety has negative effects on second or foreign language
learners. It can hinder the learners from learning a language. As it is known and proved, COVID19 caused learning anxiety for learners in all the countries that have experienced the pandemic.
Saudi Arabic is one of these countries and the Saudi learners are anxious. So, the researchers
tried to examine the dimensions of this problem that may affect EFL learning.
After analyzing the data collected from the sample taken from the University of Bisha,
this study gives evidence that the EFL learners have been suffering from anxiety during COVID19. It was concluded that Saudi EFL learners showed normal anxiety towards their learning
during COVID-19. In general, female learners had anxiety more than male learners. Moreover,
the study revealed some internal factors and external factors that increase the negative effects of
anxiety on EFL learning during COVID-19. Moreover, the EFL learners try to use some
strategies to decrease the negative effects of anxiety on EFL learning during COVID-19. The
study concludes that female learners are more affected by internal factors than male learners. So,
