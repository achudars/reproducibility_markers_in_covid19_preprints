In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, households throughout the world have
to cope with negative shocks, either because of the disease or the various mitigation strategies
that have caused massive unemployment and financial insecurity. Previous research has shown
that negative shocks impair cognitive function and change risk, time and social preferences. In
this study, we analyze the results of a longitudinal multi-country survey conducted in Italy
(N=1,652), Spain (N=1,660) and the United Kingdom (N=1,578). We measure cognitive
function using the Cognitive Reflection Test and preferences traits using an experimentally
validated set of questions to assess the differences between people exposed to a shock compared
to the rest of the sample. We measure four possible types of shocks: labor market shock, health
shock, occurrence of stressful events, and mental health shock. Additionally, we randomly assign
participants to groups with either a recall of negative events (more specifically, a mild
reinforcement of stress or of fear/anxiety), or to a control group (to recall neutral or joyful
memories), in order to assess whether or not stress and negative emotions drive a change in
preferences.

Results show that people affected by shocks performed worse in terms of cognitive
functioning, are more risk loving, and are more prone to punish others (negative reciprocity).
Data do not support the hypotheses that the result is driven by stress or by negative emotions.

As a consequence of the current COVID-19 pandemic, an enormous number of households
around the globe have been negatively hit by different shocks; either health related, as a result
of the disease itself or as an obligation to postpone treatments, or economically related, due to
the cost of the various mitigation strategies in terms of shutdowns, layoffs and the exit of firms
(IMF 2020; WEF 2020). Negative shocks are defined as losses of income or accumulated assets
and can be classified according to the source of the loss; namely, health, labor market, natural
disaster, and poverty, amongst others.

This study analyzes the relationship between having suffered negative shocks and individual
cognitive functioning and preferences, including time and risk preferences (i.e., risk aversion and
time discounting), and social preferences. Cognitive function is defined as the capacity of an
individual to solve tasks for which relying on intuition and instinct is not a reliable guide and so
reflection is needed. These tasks include reasoning (fluid intelligence), working memory (storing
and processing information) and cognitive control (the ability to inhibit external or internal
stimuli from distracting, and the flexibility to move from one task to another) (Baddeley and
Hitch, 1974; Diamond, 2013). Risk aversion is defined as the willingness to accept certain
amounts in exchange for lotteries for which the expected value is larger (Arrow, 1965; Pratt,
1964). Furthermore, time discounting is a measure of the willingness to give up something today
in exchange for a larger sum tomorrow (Loewenstein and Prelec, 1992). Finally, social preference
means showing other-regarding concerns when it is costly and does not depend upon strategic
considerations: examples are altruism and reciprocity in distributive choices, following social
norms, participating in the community, and partaking in cooperative behavior in social
interactions (Bowles and Polanía-Reyes, 2012).

Decision making depends on preferences, beliefs, and constraints, and occurs using scarce
cognitive resources to process information to produce actual choices (Gintis, 2007; Camerer,
1995). As a result, cognitive function and preferences are of the utmost importance to
understand how having suffered shocks changed which decisions are being taken regarding
searching for jobs, the management of savings, consumption activities, collective actions, etc.,
and the aggregate implications of the pandemic and the lockdown for our societies and our
economies. In particular, understanding a change in cognitive function makes it possible to
predict the likelihood of making suboptimal decisions; a change in risk preferences allows
predicting decisions under uncertain scenarios; time discounting guides us in the understanding
of savings and other intertemporal decisions (e.g., education); and finally, social preferences help
us to anticipate how households and persons will trust, cooperate, donate, and in general,
participate in the life of the community.

The previous literature has studied negative shocks because they are experienced during the
course of a lifetime for a variety of reasons; for example, because of macroeconomic volatility
or natural events (Malmendier and Nagel, 2011; Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales, 2018; Dohmen
et al., 2016; Eckel et al., 2009). These shocks are usually mild, and to some extent more expected
and perceived as part of life, because modern economies have developed a variety of market and

social policy mechanisms to insure an individual’s consequences from these shocks, such as
unemployment subsidies. Shocks have also been studied in developing countries where poverty
and violence are widespread, and both are associated with shocks (Bogliacino, Grimalda,
Ortoleva and Ring, 2017; Mani, Mullainathan, Shafir and Zhao, 2013; Dean et al., 2018; Kremer
et al., 2019), where the institutional environment is less capable of absorbing these shocks and
instead leaves households at their mercy. More generally, both developing and developed
countries are less resilient to aggregate and correlated shocks (shocks that hit many households
at the same time and in the same direction), in which case market insurance mechanisms are
absent and the government may face financing constraints. This is a further reason to investigate
the consequences of the situation that is currently unfolding due to the COVID-19 pandemic
and the various mitigation strategies in place.

Studies have shown that economic shocks have a negative impact on cognitive function and
a positive impact on time discounting, risk aversion and social preferences. To begin with the
effect of shocks on cognitive function, some of the evidence comes from laboratory experiments
where shocks are induced as losses over a Real Effort Task (Bogliacino and Montealegre, 2020),
and where shocks are measured as large income windfalls for sugar cane farmers in rural India
(Mani et al., 2013). No effect was found for paycheck natural variations (Carvalho, Meier and
Wang, 2016), although in the latter case the shock is temporary, expected, and expected to be
temporary.

Time discounting and risk aversion are also increased when people face losses in controlled
laboratory experiments (Haushofer et al., 2013). Decker and Schimtz (2016) find a similar result
for health shock and risk aversion, although in this case the authors rely on matching over
observables characteristics and causal interpretation is less credible. Voors et al. (2012) document
increasing time discounting, but more risk-loving behaviors in the case of negative shocks
associated with violence in Burundi, using an instrumental variable strategy.

Finally, social preferences have been studied either in a class of standard strategic interactions
(e.g., trust games, gift exchange, ultimatum game, dictator game), where a subset of participants
face plausible naturally occurring exogenous shocks or in quasi-experimental studies where
partaking in the community, electoral participation and other community involvement is studied
in situations in which there is a gradient in terms of exposure to shocks. Studies on the effects
of natural disasters show an increase in pro-sociality (Cassar, Healy and von Kessler, 2017; Adger
et al., 2005), and the literature on conflict related violence finds an increase in pro-sociality
(reviewed in Bauer et al., 2016) and an increase in reciprocity (Cavatorta, Zizzo and Daoud,
2020). One study has shown that when pure endowment shocks are induced in a two-person
trust game, people become less pro-social, however in this case, inequality is more salient than
shock because the focus is on the comparison of the endowments between the two counterparts
and arguably the latter (rather than the former) is driving the results (Bejarano, Gillet and
Rodriguez-Lara, 2018). Other studies have shown that anti-social behavior after negative shocks
occur variously, due to rainfall variations in Germany (Mehlum, Miguel and Torvik, 2006),
grapevine diseases in 19th century France (Bignon, Caroli and Galbiati, 2017), the collapse of

financial schemes (Cortés, Santamaría and Vargas, 2016), and trade shocks (Dix-Carneiro, Soares
and Ulyssea, 2018); with the finding that under weak institutions, shocks drive anti-social
behavior. This latter strand seems to be at odds with the rest of the literature and will be
addressed in the Discussion.

Plausible theoretical explanations for the cognitive impact of negative shocks include scarcity,
stress, and negative emotions. According to the scarcity hypothesis, negative shocks tax mental
bandwidth, reducing cognitive control and fluid intelligence. According to an alternative
hypothesis, stress (i.e., the condition by which environmental demands exceed the regulatory
capacity of the body) decreases performance according to evidence from mammals (Roth et al.,
1988) due to alterations in the neuroendocrine network that may affect the prefrontal cortex
(Butts et al., 2011; Sánchez et al., 2000). For the third hypothesis, it is assumed that negative
emotions operate through a similar mechanism (Bogliacino et al., 2017), in particular negative
emotions activate the amygdala that may trigger a number of automatic reactions overcoming
cognitive control and fluid intelligence.

For the impact of shocks on risk and time preferences, Haushofer and Fehr (2014) reviewed
the literature on negative affect, stress, risk aversion, and time discounting. In the included
studies, stress and negative affect were administered in placebo-controlled experiments through
fear induction, minor electric shocks, or the supply of hydrocortisone. The results showed that
these negative shocks increased time discounting and risk aversion (the result is not replicated
in Kassas et al, 2020, though). A correlational study by Nguyen and Noussair (2014) showed that
negative emotions are associated with risk aversion. Since stress and negative affect are increased
by negative shocks, stress and negative emotions are plausible mechanisms to explain why
exposure to shock may change time and risk preferences.

Finally, to search for plausible explanations for the effect of negative shocks on social
preferences, we can look to the literature that has documented an increase in pro-social behavior
after exposure to violence related shocks (reviewed in Bauer et al., 2016). It is argued that this
effect may be due to a reassessment of individual beliefs (in particular, the importance of social
capital in uncertain environments, where the rentability of other forms of capital is severely
affected) or aspirations (post shock growth), or to evolutionary mechanisms that reward in-group
cooperation in intra-groups conflicts - however, the latter is mainly in relation to conflict related
shocks and may be less relevant when the exposure is at the individual level (Bauer et al., 2016).
Nevertheless, Bogliacino, Gómez, and Grimalda (2020) have assessed these mechanisms and
found no support for them. They have thus speculated that negative emotions may be the driving
force in these situations, either because they impair cognitive performance, indirectly inducing
more pro-sociality (Social Heuristics Hypothesis, Rand et al. 2012), or they may directly trigger
pro-sociality because the warm glow of giving undoes the unpleasant negative emotions
themselves (Declerc et al., 2013). This hypothesis is consistent with evidence from Bosman and
Widen (2002) and Joffily et al. (2014), although both studies are correlational and not causal.

Kingdom (UK), where a representative sample of the same participants has been followed
starting from 24 April 2020, answering two questionnaires separated by one week (defined as
wave one and wave two). In this paper, we present the results of these subjects who have
answered wave two of the study, and for whom we also have the data from the baseline survey
conducted in wave one (starting on 24 April 2020). During both wave one and wave two, we
have collected information on the exposure to shocks. In wave two, we have measured cognitive
performance, and a set of preference traits (risk and time preferences, altruism, trust, positive
and negative reciprocity) to assess whether or not they differ in people affected by negative
shocks compared with people who were not affected. Additionally, by randomly assigning
participants to a negative recall task, mildly reinforcing stress and negative emotions with respect
to control recall (recalling neutral or joyful experiences), we use a difference-in-difference
approach to assess to what extent, stress and negative affect may cause a change in cognitive
functioning and preferences. Although this is a survey with unincentivized responses, both the
instrument used to measure cognitive performance (the Cognitive Reflection Test) and
preference traits (the Global Preference Survey) are experimentally validated (Frederick, 2005;
Falk et al., 2018).

The first key methodological choice of our research is the multiple measurements (in both
wave one and wave two) of the exposure to shocks. We measure labor shocks as having suffered
a negative change in earning or wage either the week before the first interview or the week before
the current interview; stressful events shock as having suffered more than the median of the
stressful events over the two weeks; health shocks as having visited a doctor, sought to be tested,
or called the health service in response to COVID-19 or experienced severe stress, anxiety and
depression in the previous week; economic vulnerability predicted mental health shock (hereafter, the
label we use) as being predicted to be under severe stress, anxiety and depression conditional on
economic vulnerability and negative events. The second methodological strength is the use of a
randomized assignment to (placebo controlled) recall of negative emotions and stressful events.
Treatment group one was asked to recall fearful or anxious events, treatment group two was
asked to recall a stressful event, while the control group was asked to recall a neutral or joyful
event.

On the basis of the review of the literature, we hypothesize that negative shocks hamper
cognitive function, increase risk aversion and time discounting, and induce more pro-sociality
than control. Our hypothesis is that stress and negative emotions drive these results: if this is the
case, we expect negative emotions and stress recalls having a greater impact upon individuals
exposed to shocks in comparison to those who are not exposed.

Results
In total, 4,890 subjects participated in the wave two survey, from Italy (N=1,652), Spain
(N=1,660), and the UK (N=1,578) over eight days between 2–9 May 2020. For all of these
subjects, we matched the data from the first wave (one week earlier) to collect the measures of
socio-demographics (age, gender, education, income, employment status, residential space,
household size) and the measures of shocks. These shocks included the following: a measure of
6

behavioral change as a response to COVID-19 (sought to be tested, called a doctor, visited a
doctor, called the health service), a measure of stressful events (homeschooling, did not have
enough food, etc., see SOM, Section 2, Q17), a measure of stress, anxiety and depression (see
SOM, Section 2, Q26), and a measure of negative labor market shock (having been fired, a
reduction in earnings, closure of the company, etc., see SOM, Section 2, Q27). Additionally,
from our companion paper on the same data (Codagnone et al., under review), we have a
measure of the likelihood of being under stress, anxiety and depression, conditional on being
economically vulnerable and having been exposed to a shock, using a machine learning
algorithm.

For wave two, we have used the same scale of stress, anxiety and depression (SOM, Section
1, Q13) of a labor market shock (SOM, Section 1, Q14) and stressful events (SOM, Section 1,
Q12), among the same group of participants.

We have computed the following dummies for exposure to shocks: labor shock – having
suffered a reduction in earning or wage either the week before the first interview or the week
before the current interview; stressful events shock – having suffered more than the median of
the stressful events over the two weeks; health shock – having carried out any of the actions in
response to COVID-19 or having been under severe stress, anxiety and depression in the week
before; and economic vulnerability predicted mental health shock – having been predicted to be
under severe stress, anxiety and depression, conditional on economic vulnerability and negative
shocks.

We use the following experimental treatments. In wave two, before answering any questions,
the participants were administered a recall question. Treatment group one was asked to recall a
fearful or anxious episode, treatment group two was asked to recall a stressful event, and the
control group was asked to recall either a neutral or a joyful event. We used both the joyful and
neutral recall for two reasons: first, in case any of the shocks were particularly salient, it may be
recalled as well in the neutral condition, which may harm having the correct control group
(however, this turned out not to be a problem); and second, in case the statistical analysis of the
recall showed causal effect, we can test for a false positive using the joy recall as a placebo
experiment. These recalls are adapted from the literature on the effect of trauma and violence
(the phrasing is in SOM, Section 1, Recalls; Lerner et al., 2003, Callen et al., 2014, Bogliacino et
al., 2017).

After this initial question, participants were presented with three questions from the
Cognitive Reflection Test and a set of experimentally validated questions to measure risk
aversion, time discounting, altruism, trust, and positive and negative reciprocity. Besides risk
aversion and time discounting, which we have already defined, the set of social preferences
measures the following concepts: altruism – the willingness to sacrifice own payoff to the benefit
of others in choices that are distributive and non-strategic; trust – the willingness to put material
resources at the disposal of other persons; positive reciprocity – the willingness to face costs to
repay actions that are motivated by good intentions; and negative reciprocity – the willingness
to punish behavior that deviates from social norms.

In SOM, Section 3, Table S1, we report the dependent variables broken down by
experimental conditions. In Column (5), we perform Pearson’s chi-squared test to assess
whether or not we can treat joy recall and neutral recall together: indeed, we find that we cannot
reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference. In SOM, Section 3, Table 2, we present
descriptive statistics broken down per experimental condition and a test of balancing of the
covariates (column (6), Pearson’s chi-squared test): as expected, given random allocation, there
are no systematic differences across experimental conditions for any of the covariates (age,
gender, education, income, employment status, residential space, household size).

In the results that we are reporting, for the regression analysis of each dependent variable, we
used the dummy for shocks as the main independent variable, we condition on the covariates
and the two recalls of negative emotions and stress, and we control for Multiple Hypotheses
Testing estimating Romano and Wolff p-values (RW). In Figure 1 below, we report the estimated
effect size for the outcomes separately, for each of the four measures of shocks. We
systematically detect a negative effect of shocks on cognitive performance, a positive effect on
risk propensity and a positive effect on negative reciprocity. All of these effects are robust to
Multiple Hypotheses Testing, except for negative reciprocity with labor shock. For the cognitive
performance, labor market shock reduces accuracy by -0.1 of a standard deviation (t=-3.20,
RW=0.013), health shock by -0.17 of a standard deviation (t= -5.70, RW=0.000), stressful events
shock by -0.17 of a standard deviation (t=-5.62, RW=0.000), and economic vulnerability
predicted mental health shock by -0.18 of a standard deviation (t=-6.18, RW=0.000). For the
risk propensity scale, labor market shock increases propensity by 0.21 of a standard deviation
(t=7.25, RW=0.000), health shock by 0.12 of a standard deviation (t=4.03, RW=0.000), stressful
events shock by 0.29 of a standard deviation (t=9.41, RW=0.000), and economic vulnerability
predicted mental health shock by 0.11 of a standard deviation (t=3.68, RW=0.002). For negative
reciprocity, labor market shock increases the propensity to punish a deviant behavior by 0.07 of
a standard deviation (t=2.16, RW=0.164), health shock by 0.13 of a standard deviation (t= 4.32,
RW=0.000), stressful events shock by 0.16 of a standard deviation (t=5.09, RW=0.000), and
economic vulnerability predicted mental health shock by 0.12 of a standard deviation (t=3.88,
RW=0.002). Supporting regressions are reported in SOM, Section 3, Tables S3-S6. Stressful
events’ shocks show an additional positive effect on patience (t=3.66, RW=0.004). However,
neither health shock (t=1.23, RW=0.203), economic vulnerability predicted mental health shock
(t=-0.98, RW=0.701) nor labor shock (t=2.02, RW=0.203) show the same result.

To assess the hypothesis that stress and negative emotions are the causal mechanism behind
these differences in cognitive performance and preferences after being exposed to a shock, we
analyze the effect of the experimental manipulation. We performed difference-in-difference
regressions: outcome variables are regressed over a dummy for shock, two dummies for negative
emotions recall and stress recall, and a dummy for the interaction between shock and the
negative emotions recall or the stress recall. All of the regressions include the standard covariates
(age, gender, education, income, employment status, residential space, household size). The
coefficient of interest is that of the interaction term: this should be interpreted as the difference
in outcome between those recalling negative events and those recalling joyful or neutral events
under shocks, with respect to the difference in outcome between those recalling negative events
and those recalling joyful or neutral events without having been exposed to shock (i.e. the

expected value of [(𝑌𝑖𝑡𝑟,1 − 𝑌𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑙,1 ) − (𝑌𝑖𝑡𝑟,0 − 𝑌𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑙,0 )|𝑋𝑖 ],where i is the subject, Y the
outcome variable, tr and ctrl refers to the experimental conditions, 0 and 1 to the shock status,
and X is our set of covariates). Data fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no negative
affect or stress effect.

We report the results for the outcomes that differ according to exposure to shock: cognitive
performance, risk aversion and negative reciprocity for all measures of shocks, and time
discounting for stressful events’ shocks. For cognitive performance, the null hypothesis of the
absence of effect of the recall in those suffering shocks compared with those who did not, is not
rejected when we use labor market shock (t= 1.02, RW= 0.904), health shock (t= -1.06, RW=
0.897), stressful events shock (t= 0.63, RW= 0.91), and economic vulnerability predicted mental
health shock (t= -1.51, RW= 0.589). For risk propensity, we similarly cannot reject the null
hypothesis when we use labor market shock (t= -0.98, RW= 0.904), health shock (t= 0.35, RW=
0.998), stressful events shock (t= -0.85, RW= 0.91), and economic vulnerability predicted mental
health shock (t= 1.31, RW= 0.695). Finally, for negative reciprocity, we confirm the same finding
when we use labor market shock (t= -1.24, RW= 0.839), health shock (t= 0.01, RW= 0.998),
9

stressful events shock (t= -1.78, RW= 0.397), and economic vulnerability predicted mental
health shock (t= 0.39, RW= 0.902). For the time discounting in case of stressful events shock,
we cannot reject the null hypothesis (t= -1.03, RW= 0.886).

For the other outcome variables, regardless of the way we measure shocks, there is no
significant interaction term. Supporting regressions are in SOM, Section 3, Tables S7-S10. In
SOM, Tables S11-S14, we also report the regressions with the double interactions (shock times
negative affect recall and shock times stress recall), where results do not change.

In Table 1 below, we summarize these findings.

Finally, we analyze whether there are differences between the three countries, and indeed we
find some heterogeneity. In Figure 2 below, we report the effect size per country in percentage
of standard deviation, using stressful events as a measurement of shock. In Italy, shock reduces
cognitive performance by -0.14 of a standard deviation (t= -2.34, RW= 0.079), increases risk
propensity by 0.17 of a standard deviation (t= 2.87, RW= 0.019) and decreases altruism by -0.15
of a standard deviation (t= -2.42, RW= 0.077). In Spain, participants affected by shock have a
higher risk propensity by 0.29 of a standard deviation (t= 5.56, RW= 0.000) and more negative
reciprocity by 0.14 of a standard deviation (t= 2.57, RW= 0.058). In the UK, respondents
affected by shock have a lower cognitive performance by -0.23 of a standard deviation (t= -4.51,
RW= 0.000), a higher risk propensity by 0.28 of a standard deviation (t= 5.32, RW= 0.000),
more altruism by 0.15 of a standard deviation (t= 2.72, RW= 0.032), and more negative
reciprocity by 0.13 of a standard deviation (t= 2.42, RW= 0.077).

Results at the country level are less consistent across measures, especially in Italy. In fact, for
example, labor shocks have qualitatively the same results, but are not statistically significant, and
health shocks negatively affect cognitive functioning (t= -2.45, RW= 0.094), whereas economic
vulnerability predicted mental health shock does not correlate with changes in cognitive
performance or preferences. This is less the case in Spain and in the UK. By looking at
differences across countries, we should be cautious since the power is reduced for each test,
since we are using just a portion of the sample. All supporting regressions are reported in SOM,
Section 3, Tables S15-S17. In the same tables, we report the results of the difference-indifference estimation. Again, data fail to reject the null hypothesis of no stress and negative
emotions effects.

In this article, we report results from a longitudinal multi-country study (Italy, Spain and the
UK). We randomized participants to recall fearful or stressful events and we measured exposure
to labor market, health, or other types of shocks. As outcome variables, we measured cognitive
function using the Cognitive Reflection Test and preferences traits using an experimentally
validated set of questions on risk, time, and social preferences.

Regardless of how it was measured, we found that a negative shock predicted lower cognitive
function, more risk aversion, and more propensity to punish (negative reciprocity). When we
assessed the negative affect and stress hypothesis, we could not reject the null hypothesis of lack
of an effect. Regarding the initial hypotheses, we confirmed the negative impact of shocks on
cognitive performance and the positive impact on negative reciprocity, but we found the
opposite result than expected for risk propensity. One possibility is that the present context of
the strong economic crisis is interpreted in terms of coping with risk in order to avoid losses,
and this would be consistent with increasing loss aversion. However, it is worth noting that at
least two studies have had a similar result as ours: a study of violence shock in Burundi finds an
increase in risk propensity (Voors et al., 2012), and another study in India shows that betting
increases in families according to the number of shocks that they have experienced (intensive
margin) (Bandhari and Kundu, 2014). The findings reject the initial hypothesis that the effect of
shocks on outcome variables is induced by negative emotions and stress. We have focused on
this explanation because it parsimoniously predicts the effect of negative shocks on cognitive,
time and risk preferences and social preferences. It is possible that the recall manipulation is too
mild to generate an impact (there are obvious limitations in terms of what can be done within
the ethical limits of experiments and the logistical limits of online surveys), so we cannot exclude
that with stronger manipulations, the null hypothesis can be rejected.

As reviewed in the Introduction, there is quasi-experimental evidence that shows an increase
in anti-social behavior (petty crimes and property crimes) after negative shocks (Mehlum, Miguel
and Torvik, 2006; Bignon, Caroli and Galbiati, 2017; Cortés, Santamaría and Vargas, 2016; DixCarneiro, Soares and Ulyssea, 2018), but those results do not contradict our results for two
reasons: first, in the anti-social behavior literature, the results are mediated by weak institutions;
second, an increase in anti-social behavior under shock is compatible with any set of preferences,
simply if the opportunity costs of misbehaving for some individuals change dramatically.

This study has implications for the literature on the study of shocks because it provides
evidence with plausible external validity, which complements the results of experiments where
shocks are randomly administered but in a less externally valid setting (e.g., Bogliacino and
Montealegre, 2020). If we assume that preferences have an idiosyncratic component which is
subject to shocks, we show what is the direction of the effect of those shocks, and this has
important implications for the literature on endogenous preferences (Bowles, 1998), the classic
claim of which is that institutional settings have long-term implications for the evolution of
values and tastes. Exposure to shock is heterogeneous both in intensity and diffusions but is
reasonably common: the fact that cognitive performance and preferences are shaped by this
12

1

experience may have important consequences for how we model the evolution of our societies.
Finally, it has important implications in terms of public health: the current pandemic and the
mitigation strategies (lockdowns) have produced significant consequences in terms of labor
market and health shocks, and it is important to provide creative policy solutions for the future
and to anticipate these changes, in the design of a future response to pandemics. An important
strength of this study is that we were able to separately analyze the effect of inducing stress or
negative emotions, the effect of having suffered a shock, and the combination of the two. By
providing an exogenous source of variation through experimental conditions, this design
controls for confounding factors and is better suited to an analysis of causal impact.

As usual, this study has some limitations. Ideally, one should measure cognitive performance
and elicit preferences using induced value theory (Smith, 1976, 1982). Without properly
incentivized tasks, responses can be noisier, and this may reduce the statistical power (Camerer
and Hogarth, 1999). Nevertheless, the use of experimentally validated questions is a strength of
this study and suggests strong construct validity. The three countries under examination (Italy,
Spain and the UK) are considered to be countries that have mismanaged the overall pandemic;
thus, one may wonder to what extent these results are generalizable to countries where the shock
has been dealt with more efficiently. However, Italy, Spain, and the UK are also the countries in
Europe where the pandemic and the lockdown have had the strongest impacts, and this suggests
that confounding factors are less salient in driving the results of the effect of shocks. Current
findings therefore contribute significantly to the existing literature that examines how people
respond to difficult and emerging times, whereby the current COVID-19 situation is an
extraordinarily strong example.

We submit a link to a random sample of participants to an online panel in three countries:
Italy, Spain, and the UK. The study is preregistered on OSF: https://bit.ly/2WjzOUe. The
English version of the questionnaire can be found in the Supplementary Online Materials,
Section 1. Ethics approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the Universitat
Oberta de Catalunya. All respondents provided informed consent. All methods were performed
in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations by Nature Scientific Reports.

31
32
33

35

All participants answered two online questionnaires over the course of two weeks. The wave
one questionnaire included socio-demographics, self-reported health status, labor market status,
and exposure to shock (SOM, Section 2 Questions 1-13, 18-21, 27, 24-26). Wave one is described
and analyzed in Codagnone et al. (under review). All questions are standardized and
psychometrically validated.

36
37
38
39

Those participants who agreed to take part in wave two were randomly assigned to four
conditions: Recall of Negative Emotions, Recall of Stress, Recall of Positive Emotion, Neutral
Recall (SOM, Section 1, Recalls). The phrasing is taken from Callen et al. (2014) and Bogliacino
et al. (2017), and adjusted with COVID-19 and lockdown related examples. The assignment
13

1

criterion is the following: 30% is assigned to Recall of Negative Emotions, 30% to Recall of
Stress, 20% to Recall of Positive Emotions, and 20% to Neutral Recall. The recall is shown just
before answering the outcome variable questions.

Outcome variables are cognitive performance and preference traits. Cognitive performance
is measured through a three-questions version of the Cognitive Reflection Test (Fredericks,
2005; SOM, Section 1, Questions 1-3). Risk and time preferences, altruism, trust, positive and
negative reciprocity are measured through the Falk et al. (2018)’s Global Preference Survey
(SOM, Section 1, Questions 4-10).

Exposure to shock is measured in the following way: labor market shock – having suffered a
change in wage or earnings over the previous two weeks; stressful events shock – having suffered
more than the median of the stressful events over the previous two weeks; health shock – having
carried out any of the actions in response to COVID-19 or having been under severe stress,
anxiety and depression the week before; and economic vulnerability predicted mental health
shock – being predicted to be under severe stress, anxiety and depression conditional on
economic vulnerability and negative shocks. To estimate the relationship between the factors of
economic vulnerability and exposure to negative economic shocks and stress, anxiety and
depression, a random forest model is used, with bootstrapping (550 iterations). The following
are the predictors used in the model: household income, a dummy for unemployed, a dummy
for homeownership, living space, household size, number of children of school age, financial
buffer stock, negative events that occurred in the previous week, and change in income or
earnings (SOM, Section 2, Wave 1 Questionnaire, Q5, Q7, Q9, Q10, Q11, Q13,
Q17a/b/c/d/e/f/h/i, Q27) (Codagnone et al., 2020, under review).

23

We analyze data using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions with robust standard errors,
with the following covariates: age, sex, education, income, employment status, residence space,
household size. We control for Multiple Hypotheses Testing using Romano and Wolff standard
errors (Romano and Wolff, 2005).
