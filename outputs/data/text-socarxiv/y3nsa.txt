Governance in Crisis: Institutionalizing Reflective Report to Guide Decision
Making Under Uncertainty
Abstract
This paper proposes a communication method to improve decision and policymaking
under uncertain scenarios. The motivation for elaborating such a method is the absence
of clarity, prioritization criteria and critical thinking in considerations made by the
Brazilian federal government during the ongoing response to the epidemic of COVID-19
in the country. The expectation is that the implementation of this method would help
national leaders more easily assess the significance of evidence-based practices and
anecdata to the decisions they are urged to make under significant time and resource
constraints.

Introduction
Neither science nor politics alone will make Brazil win its war against COVID-19. The
current Minister of Health, who allegedly (Benites, 2020) argues in favor of science,
failed to prevent rapid and high rates of community transmission of the novel
coronavirus across the country. The elected president cannot think beyond political
survival (Reuters, 2020). The minister needs to acknowledge fundamental containment
and mitigation limitations the country faces in this pandemic. The president must admit
that many challenges imposed by this virus will not be addressed by intuition or
replicating foreign policies. The current national debate between evidence-based policy
and anecdata will only prolong the exit to this unprecedented crisis (​Ansell & Geyer,
2017; Pinheiro-Machado, 2020)​. On the one had, the recency of and uncertainty around
this pathogen makes tackling it uniquely from a traditional scientific standpoint less

effective (Aguilera, 2020; ​Lunn et al., 2020​). On the other hand, the chances of
prescribing a course of action that has not been sufficiently scrutinized could pose great
health risks to those seeking treatment and quickly backfire (Jiang, 2020; Godin, 2020).
In this context, this article argues that erratic institutions can incrementally (​Feitsma,
2018, p. 9) ​improve governance during crises (​Zeitlin, 2015, p. 9)​ by institutionalizing a
straightforward reflective report format (​Sen, 2010)​, verbal or written, among policy
advisors. The expectation is that the incorporation of a methodology that favors critical
thinking will help decision makers draw a more accurate picture (​Pinto et al., 2018) ​of
concerted actions (​Cabannes & Lipietz 2018) ​to address wicked problems (​Head,
2008)​.

Background
Brazil’s health minister waited until first reported cases in the country to come up with a
plan to contain the spread of the new coronavirus (​Lima, 2020)​. He also initially
downplayed the effects of this epidemic. He said the Brazilians should wait and see how
this virus would behave in warmer places (Folha de São Paulo, 2020). Such a
statement was made despite regions in the same latitude having already expressed
growing concern about the chances of community transmission (Khalik, 2020). The slow
response of the minister to contain this virus has significantly affected the capacity of
the country to come up with containment strategies such as testing, tracking and
isolating infected and suspected cases (Reeves, 2020).

In addition, the minister has apparently transferred the responsibility of his decisions to
guidelines provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Falcão & Vivas, 2020).
This international body plays a key role in gathering and informing the international
community about emerging health risks. However, it has been criticized for i) being slow
in pandemic responses (​Feldwisch-Drentrup​, 2020), ii) deliberately ignoring key
stakeholders (Mulier, 2020) and iii) proposing a policy ('test, test, test') (Wood, 2020)
that is not feasible for ill-prepared countries. Brazilian public health authorities failed to
prepare the country to carry out rapid, reliable and mass testing (Barifouse, 2020). Thus
they cannot quickly identify cases and as a result track and link them to clusters. To
make matters worse, the ‘Wuhan approach’ to enforce extensive and long lockdowns to
suppress the spread of the virus is not feasible in large urban areas in Brazil due to the
number of people living under the poverty line (Costa, 2020). If Wuhan-style lockdowns
are to be enforced, the result would be chaos, like India has been witnessing (Bisht,
2020). Also, the poor in Brazil, under the current welfare system, have already made it
clear that they would rather die of respiratory-related illnesses than of hunger (Vespa,
2020). Therefore, the strategy to reduce the risk of mortality among the most vulnerable
in Brazil needs to be adapted to the country's socioeconomic conditions (​Dunn et al.,
2020; Ghebreyesus, 2020).​ At the current rate of uncontrolled community transmission,
this solution depends on a treatment or a still-distant vaccine (Fauci, 2020) to ensure
Brazilians can safely return to 'normal life' while protecting the most vulnerable within
their inner social circles. Until then, the national leader and his close advisors need to

avoid that this health crisis turns into a devastating social and economic crisis (Albertus,
2020).

The Brazilian president has advocated that doctors prescribe a contested medication to
fight the disease (COVID-19) caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) (Jornal
Nacional, 2020). This claim follows the echoes of the U.S. president (ABC News, 2020).
However, the scientific community is cautious about prescribing such medicine due to
lack of randomized controlled trials that verify the safety and effectiveness of such
medicine to combat this respiratory disease (Piller, 2020). In Brazil, there has been
anecdotal evidence that such medical treatment should be administered (Folha de São
Paulo, 2020a). The Minister of Health and research institutes in the country, however,
have been cautious about recommending this treatment to the public at large (Globo,
2020; Governo do Brasil, 2020). The minister, instead, has sided with the World Health
Organization's mitigation policy of stay-at-home and social distancing as preferred
methods to break infection chains (Resende & Matoso, 2020). The expectation is that
such policies will momentarily bring infection rates down and thus reduce the chances
of public health services collapsing due to the surge number of patients seeking
hospitalization concomitantly (Jansen, 2020).

The president, however, argues that stay-at-home orders, as enacted by state
governors, should be immediately halted (Jornal Nacional, 2020a). He argues that
losses in the economy are to cause more suffering to the country than the expected

death of thousands of vulnerable individuals (UOL, 2020). The Brazilian society is as of
now divided into following the president economic perspectives or complying with
scientific reassurances (Estadão, 2020).

Theoretical Framework
The clash observed in Brazil illustrates to a certain extent the academic debate around
evidence-based policy (​Cairney, 2016; ​Easterly, 2016; ​Newman, 2017​). Supporters of
incorporating science into politics, despite its challenges (​Newman et al., 2017)​, tend to
argue that it is evidence (​Costa et al., 2019)​, and not emotion, intuition, ideology or
isolated anecdotes, that should feed policymaking (​Goering & Piat, 2016)​. If an
argument cannot be statistically supported and explained, it carries less weight for
policy making (​Liebman, 2013)​. Critics of this scientific method argue that the term
'evidence' itself is rather subjective since it fails to encompass the complexity of social
phenomena (​Cowen et al., 2017; Mullen, 2016; Rodriguez et al.; 2017; Saltelli &
Giampietro, 2015; Sinclair et al., 2019)​. In addition, skeptics argue that it is not
uncommon for scientists to disagree even after enjoying plenty of time to collect and
analyse large sets of data (​Saltelli & Giampietro 2017)​.

In the context of crisis management, this long-standing academic debate tends to
become even more heated. In the context of the US, which has now the largest number
of infections to the novel coronavirus and deaths to COVID-19 worldwide, the president
and its main scientific advisor cannot agree over which direction the country is heading
to (​Haffajee & Mello, 2020; Washington Post, 2020)​. This is because time is of the

essence. Crises are extraordinary situations that demand immediate response with
minimum, incomplete or no information whatsoever (​Moynihan, 2008)​. In these
moments, decision makers are elevated to a position that society looks up for coherent
explanations and coordinated actions to reduce their anxiety over the effects of the
unfolding event in their routines (​Boin et al., 2016; Lazzarini & Musacchio, 2020)​.

It is not only limited time that decision makers are constrained by. They are also unable
to process every piece of critical information that is given to them on a daily, or even
hourly, basis (​James & Wooten, 2010)​. This makes them resort to cognitive
mechanisms that help them effortlessly organize and prioritize thoughts and interests
(​Kahneman, 2003)​. Values and beliefs shaped by decision makers' experiences are the
variables that set in motion ​where​ and ​how​ each piece of information stacks up (​Abers
et al. 2013; Clandinin & Caine, 2013; Codato et al., 2015; Gauchat, 2015; Walsh, 2018)​.
Humans, in general, seek comfort in messages that confirm our idiosyncrasies (​Cook &
Smallman, 2008)​. We try our best to avoid the psychological stress that conflicting
information has on challenging our prior set of beliefs forcing us to review and shift
preconceived courses of action (​Brehm & Cohen, 1962). ​Public authorities tend to
cognitively react to avoid penalizing their beliefs just as most people do (​Carnielli,
2008).

Nevertheless, national leaders live under the public eye. They are not allowed to err as
frequently as normal people do (​Flyvbjerg et al.,2002)​. They must find ways to enhance

their decision-making processes (​Willems & Van Dooren, 2016)​. Consulting with experts
from different fields about a particular issue during critical times can certainly help them
in this endeavor (​Alexiadou & Gunaydin, 2019)​. They could also momentarily gather a
limited number of advisors that are thoughtful in their proposals and able to
communicate effectively (​Davidson, 2017; Walsh, 2018) ​to provide them with daily
updates and recommendations. This deliberative process, however, can quickly
become time consuming and unproductive (​Scolobig et al., 2016)​. Thus a structure
guiding advisors to share opinions and help the decision maker easily grasp a myriad of
viewpoints is highly desirable.

Reflective reports help advisors incorporate elements of critical thinking into their
communication with the decision maker. Leaders often look for resourceful analysis
(​Koh, 2017)​. In the deliberative process proposed in this study, advisors are not
expected to debate with other advisors (​Martin, 2000)​. They are, instead, expected to
outline their opinion in the most concise and simplest form. While actively listening to
each advisor, leaders should pay less attention to the argument itself than to
assumptions, examples and generalizations advisors put forth. For instance, if a
comparative example is brought up to substantiate an argument, leaders should ask
themselves whether such comparison is valid in the first place. Also, anecdotal
evidence can indeed be a sign of an emerging problem or solution (​Parnell, 2017).
However, it is the rationality, especially scientific, supporting the significance of an

outlier and the trade-offs that it ensues that must be carefully considered by the decision
maker (​Rosenthal & Kouzmin, 1997)​.

This paper, therefore, proposes that national leaders encourage advisors to expose the
assumptions and limitations of their recommendations. National leaders also need to
ask advisors to structure reflective reports in the format of brief narratives (​Sanne, 2008)
that help them easily grasp the complexity of an argument. The objective of
institutionalizing reflective reports into decision making under uncertainty is to ensure
that leaders are not overwhelmed by the increasing number of information they are
constantly bombarded with. The simple structure of reflective reports also helps leaders
understand and remember the key points presented to them before making a decision
(​Wright & Goodwin, 2009)​.

Method
The objective of reflective reports is to help decision makers and their ​ad hoc​ committee
to make the best possible decisions under significant time, information and resource
constraints. The main assumptions of adopting such a methodology is that leaders i)
have selected the most thoughtful communicators (​Stewart et al., 2020) ​in the country to
join this crisis response task force and that these advisors ii) do not hesitate to
challenge their own assumptions and swiftly change course when conflicting information
emerges. The expectation is that leaders adopting this method can optimize
decision-making processes and reduce the risks of making decisions that will act
against the public interest (​Scicluna & Auer 2019)​.

Figure: Structure of 4-Step Reflective Report

The length of each report varies in terms of the number of advisors and time constraints
to reach a decision. The duration of the entire deliberative process should be kept to a
minimum. Keeping it short ensures that the decision maker is not overwhelmed and can
consider each argument before making a decision. Brevity in this deliberative process is
also encouraged because it is expected that these meetings will occur daily and
sometimes more than once a day.

Limitations

Reflective reports in the context of decision making under uncertainty present
limitations. The first one has to do with the ability of advisors to translate complexity into
compelling narratives without missing key facts. Advisors may also excessively simplify
their interpretation of reality for the sake of clarity (​Feitsma, 2018)​. The second limitation
has to do with gatekeeping (​Dargent, 2015, p. 112)​. National leaders must ensure that
an ​ad hoc​ committee is not only composed of well-known experts in each field but it
also gives opportunity for thoughtful communicators to share heterodox ways of thinking
(​Land et al., 2010; Ogbunu, 2020) ​and suggest unexpected courses of action
(​Filgueiras, 2019, p. 9)​. The third limitation has to do with the cognitive ability of decision
makers. Leaders need to be aware of their biases and blind spots (​Edwards et al.,
2016)​. Self-awareness allows decision makers to prioritize what it is in the interest of the
public good rather than their own or their group. The last limitation assumes that each
advisor's recommendation enjoys the same weight in the final decision. However, it is
expected that leaders would be more inclined to consider recommendations that
corroborate their preexisting values and beliefs (​Buckley, 2017, p. 4) ​or be more
acquiescent to advisors that had some leverage on their past decisions.

Conclusion
This article argues that national leaders can reduce the risks of the decisions they make
under uncertain scenarios. This happens when leaders gather and actively listen to an
ad hoc​ committee made up of thoughtful communicators (New Zealand Parliament,
2020). These advisors tap into compelling narratives to concisely and objectively share
opinions (​Clemson & Samara, 2013)​. Leaders, however, face many constraints to

respond to unfolding crises in a timely manner. These constraints lead them to
invariably resort to mental shortcuts before reaching a decision. Selective attention and
intuition, however, can lead to undesirable effects. Thus this paper proposes the
addition of a straightforward reflective report into deliberative processes to help decision
makers and advisors alike interpret and communicate perceived and shifting realities on
the go.

Reflective report provides a simple structure for advisors to organize and challenge their
own thoughts and opinions. It also helps national leaders grasp and process
information. In the Brazilian context, it is expected that the president works closely with
an array of experts from different fields and fairly listens to them before making
decisions. This expectation, however, has become more of a wishful thinking recently.
This is because there has been evidence that a recently organized ​ad hoc​ committee
has not been given the necessary consideration by the president (Folha de São Paulo,
2020b). The national leader has also shown not being able to convince the society that
his proposed policies are in the interest of the public good rather than his own political
agenda (​Raco & Savini, 2019, p. 225)​.
