Findings
Living near vaccination sites can reduce transportation barriers to getting the
COVID-19 vaccine. We examine how access in North Carolina varies among
demographic groups based on residents’ geographic proximity to potential
vaccination sites in centralized and dispersed distribution scenarios. We find
American Indians have substantially less proximity-based access in both scenarios;
non-Hispanic Whites, older adults, and adults with lower educational attainment
also live farther than average from potential vaccination sites. However, access
increases more for these groups in the dispersed vaccine distribution scenario.
Findings suggest programs seeking to increase vaccine access should focus on
reaching members of these demographic groups.

1. Questions
COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have been disproportionately
high among racial and ethnic minorities and older age groups in the United
States (CDC 2021b), spotlighting layers of enduring and well-documented
health disparities driven by adverse social determinants of health (CDC 2021a).
Uneven COVID-19 vaccination rates reflect these inequities; minority
individuals have been vaccinated at much lower rates than others in the early
months of the vaccine rollout (Ndugga et al. 2021). There are many recognized
barriers to health care access in the US, including socioeconomic constraints,
health literacy limitations, and a lack of reliable transportation to healthpromoting institutions like medical facilities and pharmacies (Wolfe,
McDonald, and Holmes 2020). Communities of color and older adults—those
over age 65—are some of the populations most affected by transportation
barriers to health care (Syed, Gerber, and Sharp 2013).
Living near vaccination sites can reduce transportation barriers to getting the
COVID-19 vaccine by lowering associated travel time and money costs. Our
paper tests how geographic proximity to the vaccine varies across demographic
groups when vaccines are distributed in a centralized scenario—only at
hospitals, which are most likely to house specialized infrastructure, such as
ultra-cold freezers, to store and administer vaccines (Goldhill 2020), and in a
dispersed scenario—with the vaccine available at hospitals, medical sites (i.e.,
community health centers and rural health clinics), and pharmacies.

2. Methods
Our spatial analysis used point data representing locations which might serve
as potential vaccination sites in North Carolina. Specifically, we sourced
information on the location of hospitals, community health centers, and rural

Access to the COVID-19 Vaccine in Centralized and Dispersed Distribution Scenarios

health clinics from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS 2021),
and the locations of pharmacies using points-of-interest data from SafeGraph
(SafeGraph 2020). All demographic data were derived from 2019 American
Community Survey 5-year estimates (US Census Bureau 2021).
We calculated the average distance to potential vaccination sites for the state’s
total population and for select demographic groups in centralized and
dispersed distribution scenarios. We weighted distances to examine averages for
the total population and demographic groups by multiplying the proportion
of the state population belonging to these groups and residing in each block
group by the block group’s distance to the nearest potential vaccination site
(calculated using the Euclidean distance between the block group’s centroid
and the nearest site). We summed these weighted distances for all block groups
to calculate average distances.
Using data on COVID-19 incidence collected at the county level by the North
Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS 2021), we
also briefly report results regarding how incidence of COVID-19 in
northeastern North Carolina may be associated with access to potential
vaccination sites.

3. Findings
3.1. Proximity-Based Access Analysis
In the centralized distribution scenario (Table 1, column 1; Figure 1) we find
that, on average, North Carolina residents live 8.93 kilometers (km) from the
nearest hospital. In the dispersed distribution scenario (Table 1, column 2;
Figure 2), we find that the average distance for the total population to the
closest hospital, community health center, rural health clinic, or pharmacy is
3.36 km.
American Indians, non-Hispanic Whites, people age 45 and over, and adults
without college degrees live farther than average from potential vaccination
sites. Distances are particularly great for American Indians, who live 3.27 km
farther from hospitals in the centralized distribution scenario and 1.40 km
farther from all potential vaccination sites in the dispersed distribution
scenario. While American Indians make up a relatively small percentage of the
state’s total population, this group has had more COVID cases per capita than
Black and White North Carolinians (Pulliam 2021). We observe relatively little
variation in average distance from potential vaccination sites compared to the
total population for females, children, and individuals living in households
with annual incomes less than $100,000. Adults under age 45, non-Hispanic
Blacks, Hispanic people, individuals living in households with annual incomes
greater than $100,000, and adults with bachelor’s degrees live closer to
potential vaccination sites in both distribution scenarios. We find that zero-

Zero-vehicle households

vehicle households are located 1.74 km and 0.74 km closer, respectively, to
potential vaccination sites in the centralized and dispersed distribution
scenarios.
In comparing the two distribution scenarios, the difference between average
distances to the nearest potential vaccination site represents the “proximity
gain” that different groups experience in the dispersed scenario (Table 1,
column 3). Relative to the average change in distance to the nearest potential
vaccination site observed for the total population (5.58 km), the difference
is 1.33 times larger for American Indians (7.44 km) and between 1.02 and
1.05 times larger for non-Hispanic Whites (5.84 km), people age 45 and over
(5.75 km), and adults without college degrees (5.76 km). While members of
these groups still tend to live farther from potential vaccination sites in both
scenarios, sites are significantly closer for them when expanding to a dispersed
distribution scenario.

3.2. Multiple Vulnerability Factors and the COVID-19 Vaccine
Rollout
As of February 18, 2021, Hyde County, located in northeastern North
Carolina, had the highest number of total COVID-19 cases per capita in the
state (1,246 cases per 10,000 residents) (NCDHHS 2021). In Figure 3, we
see that Hyde’s surrounding counties have relatively large proportions of zerovehicle households. We see in Figures 1 and 2 that some block groups in and
around Hyde County are located relatively far from potential vaccination sties.
Ensuring equitable vaccine distribution demands considering the multiple
vulnerability factors, including socioeconomic disadvantage, transportation
disadvantage, and COVID susceptibility, which might disproportionately
affect particular demographic groups. Methods used in this paper to identify
groups that live farther from potential vaccination sites should be applied
elsewhere to understand communities with less proximity-based access to the
vaccine. Combined with knowledge of geographies where car access is low
and COVID incidence is high, such understanding can inform those involved
in the vaccine rollout about how to equitably target resources to address
transportation barriers and connect people to the vaccine.
