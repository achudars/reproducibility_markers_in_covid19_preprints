INEFFICIENT PROCUREMENT IN TIMES OF PANDEMIA

Abstract. The public health and economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pan-

demic has pushed governments to substantially and swiftly increase spending. Consequently, public procurement rules have been relaxed in many places to expedite
transactions. However, this may also create opportunities for inefficiency and corruption. Using contract-level information on public spending from Colombia’s eprocurement platform, and a difference-in-differences identification strategy, we find
that municipalities classified by a machine learning algorithm as more prone to corruption react to the spending surge by using a larger proportion of discretionary
non-competitive contracts and increasing their average value, especially to procure
crisis-related items. In these places, contracts signed during the emergency are more
likely to have cost overruns, be awarded to campaign donors, and exhibit a range
of implementation inefficiencies. Our evidence suggests that large negative shocks
such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic may increase waste and corruption.

INEFFICIENT PROCUREMENT IN TIMES OF PANDEMIA

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic rapidly expanded throughout the entire world in the first half of
2020. In an effort to control the spread of the disease, many governments established stringent lockdown measures that restricted the mobility of hundreds of millions and paralyzed
large sectors of the economy (Acemoglu et al., 2020; Ludvigson et al., 2020). Consequently, in
addition to the large investments in medical infrastructure and related supplies, billions have
been allocated for poverty relief and to support vulnerable businesses. This paper argues
that the need of governments to quickly spend large amounts of resources increases discretion, which in turn may translate into inefficiency and corruption opportunities in public
procurement.
In many countries, COVID-driven spending needs have forced governments to relax public
procurement protocols (De Michele and Cruz, 2020).1 Easing procurement rules increases the
discretion of public officials, which may create waste, favoritism, and corruption opportunities that could offset the full potential benefits of the policies aimed at promoting short-term
relief spending in the face of large negative shocks. Indeed, there is widespread evidence
that discretion in procurement may result in inefficiencies and corruption (Transparency International, 2010; Tran, 2011; Palguta and Pertold, 2017; Decarolis et al., 2020; Baltrunaite
et al., 2018; Kang and Miller, 2017).2 Using administrative data for almost 360,000 contracts
procured in Colombia around the first confirmed COVID-19 case in March 2020, we show
that the pandemic increased the incidence and the value of discretionary contracts, especially
in places that have traditionally had high levels of corruption. Moreover, we show that in
these places, contracts signed during the emergency are more likely to have cost overruns,
be awarded to campaign donors, and exhibit implementation inefficiencies.

However, under certain circumstances, more discretion can in fact reduce corruption and improve efficiency
(Coviello et al., 2018; Duflo et al., 2018; Bandiera et al., 2009, 2020).

Our identification strategy leverages on weekly longitudinal variation across the country’s
roughly 1,100 municipalities, exploiting the timing of the first detected case of COVID-19 in
the country, as well as the cross-sectional variation provided by the baseline probability that
a municipality is corrupt. We estimate the latter using an ensemble model that aggregates
the corruption predictions of four canonical machine learning algorithms, trained on almost
150 municipality-level characteristics to predict observed cases of corruption prosecutions
from 2008 to 2015.
After the outbreak of COVID-19 in Colombia, places that rank higher on our predicted
baseline corruption scale differentially increase the use of discretionary contracts, which are
awarded using a direct selection procedure and allow for no competition whatsoever among
bidders. The effect is economically large: a one-standard-deviation increase in the predicted
baseline probability of corruption increases the probability of awarding a discretionary contract (the average value of a discretionary contract) by 3.4% (7.5%) relative to the preCOVID-19 period weekly mean. The effect is larger for contracts that procure crisis-related
items such as food and medical supplies (a 13% increase relative to the mean). Moreover,
the differential effect of the outbreak on discretionary spending in corrupt municipalities is
substantially larger after the government declared a state of emergency that enabled local
governments to avoid competitive procurement processes.
Importantly, we control for municipality and week fixed effects throughout, as well as
the interaction of the latter with baseline levels of population, population density, and a
poverty index, which indirectly capture the latent municipal demand for public procurement
to face the crisis. Moreover, our results remain unchanged if we control for the spread of
the disease across the country. This allows us to rule out the idea that the most corrupt
places were more affected by the disease, and accordingly, had to adapt their procurement
strategies more intensively than their less corrupt counterparts. Our results are also robust
to controlling for municipalities’ access to ports and markets, thus suggesting that the results
are not driven by corrupt places facing more difficulties and higher prices in the acquisition
of crisis-related items. Finally, the main findings are substantively the same if instead of

INEFFICIENT PROCUREMENT IN TIMES OF PANDEMIA

using our predicted baseline corruption measure as the treatment variable, we use official
transparency and institutional capacity indices.
To be sure, while compelling, our quantitative evidence is only suggestive about the corruption effects of the pandemic. Because of its illegal nature, objectively measuring corruption
is challenging (Olken, 2007; Olken and Pande, 2012; Fisman, 2001). We posit that waste
and corruption are very likely in this setting because: i) As mentioned, more discretionary
and less competitive procurement often generate graft opportunities; ii) We show that in
places that rank higher on our corruption scale, contracts signed amid the emergency are
more likely to receive cost overrun alerts from the Office of the Comptroller General, be
awarded to campaign donors, and exhibit time and budget extensions. In turn, these inefficiencies are highly correlated with the incidence of corruption (Gallego et al., 2020); iii) We
discuss anecdotal evidence in section 2 that provides strong support to our interpretation
that procurement rules relaxations in response to the crisis have led to more corruption.
This paper contributes to the literature studying the governance challenges imposed by
episodes of crisis and catastrophic events, such as wars (Querubin and Snyder, 2013), disasters (Leeson and Sobel, 2008), and epidemics (Khemani, 2020), and in particular, on how
these events relate to and affect political outcomes (Fluckiger et al., 2019; Bol et al., 2020;
Campante et al., 2020; Amat et al., 2020; Daniele et al., 2020; Maffioli, 2020). We contribute
to this literature by showing that public health crises may affect bureaucratic performance
and the quality of government spending, by increasing inefficiency and corruption, which can
arguably make recovery slower (Best et al., 2019; Bandiera et al., 2020).
Natural disasters create resource windfalls that may trigger corruption and fraud (Leeson
and Sobel, 2008; Nikolova and Marinov, 2017). Catastrophic events imply the mobilization
of resources in the form of relief, which may be strategically appropriated by political actors
(Garret and Sobel, 2003; Gasper and Reeves, 2011; Gallego, 2018). Alternatively, austerity
may decrease corruption by reducing public expenditure (Daniele and Giommoni, 2021). We
delve deeper into the channels explaining inefficiency and corruption amid a catastrophe
by showing how relief spending differentially changes as a function of historical corruption.

Moreover, we contribute to this literature by empirically documenting a novel mechanism:
After a catastrophe, waste and corruption can be exacerbated because public procurement
rules need to be relaxed, which in turn can make the cure (spending) worse than the disease.
2. Context
The first detected case of COVID-19 in Colombia was announced on March 6th, 2020, and
by the end of April of that year almost 6,000 people had tested positive and almost 300
had officially died from the disease. Panel A of Figure A2 in the Appendix reports the
temporal evolution of cases in Colombia shortly after the outbreak of COVID-19. On March
17, President Iván Duque appealed to article 215 of the Constitution to declare an “economic
and social emergency”, which allowed the executive to issue emergency decrees. In one such
decrees, the National Public Procurement Agency allowed contracting entities (including
local governments) to invoke instances of manifest urgency to speed up procurement when
necessary. This entitled officials to directly select contractors without any previous bidding
stage in order to expedite the procurement of goods and services considered necessary to
face the emergency.3
A few weeks after the state of emergency was invoked, Colombia’s control agencies—
the Comptroller General, the Inspector General, and the Attorney General—revealed that
several local and regional governments were taking advantage of the situation by likely engaging in corruption. These organization released a list of of mayors and governors who had
awarded suspicious contracts, in which over costs were apparent. For instance, the Office
of the Comptroller General found out that executive authorities in the town of La Palma
had bought crisis-related items with price premiums up to 330%,4 and in Arauca food items
were bought at prices over five times the market value.5 The Colombian independent news

website, La Silla Vacı́a, studied a sample of 48 contracts awarded in 17 departments in the
midst of the emergency and found overprices in more than 40% of the contracts analyzed.6

3. Data
3.1. Public procurement. Public procurement data comes from the Sistema Electrónico
para la Contratación Pública (SECOP), a web-based platform established by the Colombian
government to digitize transactions held by public entities in the country. The platform
details more than 10 million contracts from national and subnational-level public entities.7
For this analysis, we focus on contracts held by local-level governments from January 1 to
the end of April 2020, covering 357,875 contracts with a total value of US$ 4.5 billion.8
Contract-level information includes the contract’s initial value, approval date and duration, a textual description of the contract’s purpose, indicators of time or budget extensions,
the nature of the contracting agency, and the type of process that was used to select the
contractor. The latter includes public tenders, selection based on the qualification of merits, auctions, special regime, minimum-value, and direct selection. Importantly, the direct
selection procedure is the least competitive mechanism, and its use is legally restricted to
special cases, including situations of manifest urgency caused by particular events such as
natural disasters. In turn, the textual description of each contract’s purpose allows us to use
text-analysis techniques to identify which contracts correspond to crisis-related spending. In
particular, using a dictionary method, we identify all contracts related to the procurement
of food and health-related goods and services.9

Our sample period is limited by the fact that, at the end of April, anticorruption agencies in Colombia
announced the creation of a front to combat this phenomenon. However, as we show in section 5, our
findings are robust to studying a longer period.
9
For the food category we used the Spanish words “alimentos”, “vı́veres”, “comida”, “mercados”, “kits”, while
for health-related procurement, we used the words “médico”, “salud”, “medicamentos”, “hospitalización”,
“farmacia”. The presence of any of these terms in the short description of the contract implied its inclusion
in the corresponding category.

INEFFICIENT PROCUREMENT IN TIMES OF PANDEMIA

We thus have access to fine-grained information on public spending at the municipalityweek level that allows us to confidently track whether a specific municipality used the direct
selection method (and for what value) and if such a contract corresponded to the procurement
of a crisis-related good or service. Panels B and C of Figure A2 in the Appendix present
the evolution of discretionary contracts—i.e. those awarded through the direct selection
method—as a share of the sum of discretionary and competitive contracts, respectively for
the total number of contracts and the amount awarded by these.10
3.2. Corruption. Measuring corruption is challenging (Olken, 2007; Olken and Pande,
2012). More so measuring corruption for all the districts of a particular country. Rather than
relying on perceptions of citizens or key actors—a common approach to measure corruption
championed by international organizations—we follow Gallego et al. (2020) and Colonnelli
et al. (2020) and use a machine learning approach to predict corruption based on factual
corruption detections and observable characteristics of municipalities.
Using information from the Office of the Inspector General of Colombia and originally
collected by Martinez (2019), we construct a dummy variable indicating if the mayor of each
municipality was prosecuted by this anticorruption agency in the 2008-2011 or 2012-2015
mayoral periods.11 We define this measure as our outcome variable and combine it with 147
municipal characteristics to train several machine learning models: random forest, gradient
boosting machine, lasso, and neural network. We ensemble these using Polley et al. (2011)’s
super learner approach to construct a municipal-level risk score in each of the two periods.
We use a random 70% of our dataset to train the models, and the remaining 30% to test
their performance. We use a 5-fold, 10-time repeated cross-validation procedure to train our
models and choose the optimal combination of parameters.
We asses the predictive performance of our models in the testing set using conventional
metrics, such as the Area Under the ROC curve (AUC) and the accuracy. Overall, our
10

We define ‘competitive’ contracts as those that are awarded using public tenders, auctions, selection based
on merits, or a special regime, as they imply potential competition between two or more bidders.
11
These prosecutions are carried out for violations by public officials of the disciplinary code. Consequently,
this variable should be understood as a broad measure of corruption.

INEFFICIENT PROCUREMENT IN TIMES OF PANDEMIA

7

ensemble model achieves a high level of performance, at an accuracy of 0.84 and a AUC of
0.71. Given these numbers, we proceed to construct the corresponding predicted values for
each municipality-period, which indicate the probability of being classified as corrupt. The
final score for each municipality is the average of the two probabilities, one for each period.
Note that the correlation between the probabilities of each period is quite high (0.7), which
suggests that municipal corruption may be quite persistent over time.
This index differs from municipal corruption rankings based on observed corruption cases
because it enables a highly precise detection of instances of corruption even in cases where
watchdog agencies have not detected it. Thus, we use this index throughout as our preferred
measure of corrution. However, our results are robust to using alternative transparency
measures, issued by state agencies and based on observed behavior. In Appendix A we
describe in more detail how we constructed our predicted corruption measure. Figure A1
maps the baseline geographic distribution of predicted corruption in Colombia, according to
our model.
3.3. Other Variables. Other variables used in the analysis include the distance from each
municipality to the departmental capital and to the nearest port, the longitudinal spread of
COVID-19 during our sample period, transparency indices such as the Open Government
Index (IGA by its Spanish acronym) –computed by the Inspector General– and the Integral
Development Index (IDI) –constructed by the National Planning Department– and data on
cost overrun alerts (from the Office of the Comptroller General) and on campaign donors
(from the National Electoral Council). Table A1 in the Appendix reports the descriptive
statistics.
4. Empirical strategy
4.1. Main specification. Our identification strategy exploits the timing of the first detected case of COVID-19 in Colombia (March 6th, 2020), as well as the cross-sectional
variation provided by the baseline probability of a municipality being corrupt. More formally, using the subindex m to denote municipalities and t to denote weeks, we estimate the

INEFFICIENT PROCUREMENT IN TIMES OF PANDEMIA

8

following difference-in-differences model:
(4.1)

ymt = αm + λt + β(Post Outbreakt × Corruptm ) +

X

γ 0 (c × λt ) + mt

c∈Xm

where ymt are different measures of public procurement in municipality m in week t; Corruptm
is a standardized measure of the predicted probability of corruption described in Section 3.2;
Post Outbreakt is a dummy that takes the value one after March 6th, 2020; and Xm is
a set of municipality-level characteristics measured in 2019 that include total population,
population density, and a poverty index. We interact these characteristics with the week
fixed effects, λt , to allow for differential flexible trends parametrized by these municipality
features. We also include municipality fixed effects, αm , that control for any observed or
unobserved municipal-level time invariant heterogeneity. In turn, the non-interacted week
dummies control for any time shock that affects simultaneously all the municipalities on the
same week. Finally, mt is the error term. Given that our treatment variable, Corrupt, is the
result from the predicted values of a previously-estimated model, we estimate wild bootstrap
standard errors that are clustered at the municipality level.
Our coefficient of interest, β, captures the average differential change in public procurementrelated outcome of interest,before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 in municipalities with
a high estimated baseline probability of corruption relative to municipalities with a low estimated probability. In order to measure the use of discretionary contracts, for the outcome
ymt we focus on a dummy variable indicating whether a contract was awarded using the direct selection procedure in municipality m and in week t, and the natural log of the average
amount of money awarded through this procedure. We also focus on discretionary contracts
associated to crisis-related spending, in particular to procure food and health-related services
and supplies.
4.2. Identifying assumption. The main assumption behind our empirical model is that
in the absence of the outbreak of COVID-19, the usage of discretionary public procurement
contracts in municipalities with a high estimated baseline probability of corruption would
have followed a similar trajectory to the usage of discretionary public procurement contracts

INEFFICIENT PROCUREMENT IN TIMES OF PANDEMIA

9

in municipalities with a low estimated probability. The validity of this “parallel trends”
assumption can be partially assessed by estimating the following non-parametric regression:
(4.2)

ymt = αm + λt +

X

βj (Corruptm × δt ) +

X

γ 0 (c × λt ) + εmt

c∈Xm

j∈J

where J includes all weeks in our sample except from the week before the first COVID-19
case in Colombia. Therefore, the parameters βj can be interpreted as the differential usage
of, for example, discretionary public procurement contracts in municipalities with a high
predicted probability of corruption relative to municipalities with a low probability, in week
j, relative to the week prior to the first detected COVID-19 case in the country.

5. Results
5.1. Corruption and Discretionary Contracts. Table 1 presents the main results from
specification (4.1). The dependent variable in Columns 1 to 3 is the indicator of that at least
one discretionary contract was awarded in municipality m and week t. In Columns 5 to 7 we
focus on the (log) value of discretionary contracts. We find that, after the first COVID-19
case in Colombia, there is a differential increase in the probability of using a discretionary
contract in municipalities with higher predicted baseline probability of corruption. Focusing
on Column 1, a one-standard-deviation increase in the predicted probability of corruption
increases the probability of issuing a discretionary contract in 2.5 percentage points, which
represents an increase of 3.4% with respect to the average in the pre-COVID-19 period.
Moreover, we find that the average value of a contract increased by 7.5% (see Column 5).12
In addition, Columns 2 and 6 control for the municipal prevalence of the disease by including the number of COVID-19 cases. Controlling for the prevalence of the virus is arguably a
‘bad control’, but we still do so to make sure that our results are explained by the proclivity
of engaging in corruption and not by the severity of the disease. The point estimates are
largely robust to this control, suggesting that the intensity of the COVID-19 infection is not
12Table

A2 in the Appendix shows that these results are robust to not including municipality controls, or to
their inclusion one at a time.

INEFFICIENT PROCUREMENT IN TIMES OF PANDEMIA

10

a likely channel.13 Moreover, to test whether our results are explained by municipalities with
a higher probability of corruption also finding it more difficult to access supplies, Columns 3
and 7 control for market access by including the distance of each municipality to the nearest
port and the department capital interacted with the week fixed effects. We do not find
support for this alternative story either.
Finally, in columns 5, 6, 11, and 12 of Table A2, we control for the political affiliation of
each mayor, which may be correlated with corruption. For instance, it could be the case
that, in times of crisis, the national government is less strict in the use of discretionary
spending in municipalities ruled by mayors affiliated to the same political party. Our results
are robust to the inclusion of these controls too.
5.2. Additional Robustness Tests and Alternative Specifications. Table 2 reports
additional robustness tests. First, Columns 1 and 2 report the results of a placebo exercise
in which we estimate our main model—equation (4.1)—for the same weeks but over 2019.
The null coefficients found in this case show that our results are not driven by seasonal
patterns. Second, Columns 3 to 6 assess the robustness of our inference. Columns 3 and 4
follow Conley (1999) and Conley (2016) and control for cross-sectional dependence and first
order time dependence in the error term. Columns 5 and 6 follow Bertrand et al. (2004)
and collapse the data before and after the first COVID-19 case to deal with potential serial
correlation in the dependent variable. Our results are robust to both of these corrections.
Column 7 shows that the result for the value of contracts is robust if we use a hyperbolic
sine transformation, which takes into account the zeros in the dependent variable and keeps
the number of observations constant.
Third, in Figure A4, we present the robustness to the exclusion of one department at a
time. The coefficients are stable to the exclusion of any department. Consequently, our
results are not driven by any particular department, which is important given the role that
13Furthermore,

in Table A3 of the Appendix we run a cross-sectional regression that measures the correlation
between the number of COVID-19 cases (Column 1) and the number deaths (Column 2), with our corruption
index. We do not find any significant association. Moreover, the point estimate of the correlation with the
number of COVID-19 deaths (which is arguably the most exogenous of the two measures) is very close to
zero.

INEFFICIENT PROCUREMENT IN TIMES OF PANDEMIA

11

some parts of Colombia have had in terms of both historical corruption and the spread of
the pandemic. Similarly, Tables A4 and A5 in the Appendix show that the results are robust
to the presence of outliers, both in the corruption index and in the value of the contracts.14
Therefore, the results are not driven by a handful of municipalities either. Finally, Figure
A5 plots the distribution of estimates from a randomization inference test, which involves
500 simulations where we randomly assign the estimated values of the predicted probability
of corruption across municipalities and estimate the main regression of interest for each
outcome. For both variables, the probability of finding an estimate as the one presented in
Table 1 is below 1%, showing that our results are unlikely to be driven by pure chance.
Furthermore, instead of our corruption index, we use two alternative official cross-sectional
measures of transparency and institutional capacity, at the municipality level.15 We use the
Open Government Index (IGA for its Spanish acronym), which was developed by the Office
of the Inspector General to officially measure transparency,16 and the Integral Development
Index (IDI for its Spanish acronym), constructed by the National Planning Department,
to measure institutional capacity.17 Higher IGA and IDI values, on a scale of 0 to 100,
indicate higher levels of transparency and institutional capacity, respectively. We interact
the 2016 IGA and 2017 IDI measures (the last years for which each one is available) with
the post-COVID time indicator, to determine if there is a differential change in the use of
discretionary contracts in municipalities with high levels of transparency and institutional
capacity. Columns 8 and 9 (10 and 11) of Table 2 show that a one standard deviation increase
in the IGA (IDI) index implies a reduction of 3.1 (2.7) percentage points in the probability
of issuing a discretionary contract and a decrease of 5.4% (4.6%) in the average value of this
type of contracts. These findings imply that our main result does not depend exclusively on
the measure of corruption that we built using machine learning techniques.
14We

winsorize at the 1%, 2.5%, and 5% levels these two variables and re-estimate the main models based
on (4.1).
15In other specifications, available upon request, we use the average observed corruption cases (instead of
the machine-learning prediction) as the treatment variable. The results are quite similar to those presented
in Table 1.

Finally, we corroborate that our findings are not driven by the choice of the sample period,
which ends on the week of April 27, 2020. To shed light on this, in Table A8 of the Appendix
we present the results of models in which we extend the end date in 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks,
respectively. In all cases, the results remain positive and statistically significant for our two
outcome variables of interest.
5.3. Parallel Trends and Dynamics. In Figure 1 (panels A and B), we present the results
from equation (4.2). In both panels we find no differential trends in the six weeks before
the first COVID-19 case for municipalities with a higher predicted baseline probability of
corruption relative to the ones with a lower probability. In fact, the p-values for the F-tests
of joint significance of these coefficients are 0.24 and 0.18, for panels A and B, respectively.
Overall, this evidence provides support for the main identifying assumption of our empirical
strategy. Intuitively, it is highly unlikely that there would have been any anticipatory effects,
since in January and February COVID-19 was still seen as a distant disease that would not
have major impacts in Colombia. Figure A3 reports equivalent results for the IGA and IDI,
the alternative official measures of transparency and institutional capacity. Moreover, the
figures suggest that, in contrast to the estimated (null) effects for the weeks prior to the
first COVID-19 case in Colombia, after the arrival of the pandemic there is a differential
increase in the usage and value of discretionary public procurement contracts in municipalities with a higher baseline probability of corruption, and lower levels of transparency and
institutional capacity. Interestingly, these effects grow over time, suggesting that the effect
of the pandemic on contract inefficiency and corruption is persistent.
5.4. Mechanisms. We corroborate this increasing pattern over time in a more parametric
way, by splitting the post COVID-19 period into two, taking into account the March 17
presidential decree that enabled municipalities to declare a manifest urgency in order to
increase the use of discretionary contracts. In columns 4 and 8 of Table 1, we include a
time dummy that takes the value of one for weeks between the first case and the release
of the presidential decree (called Post 1), and a second dummy that equals one for weeks
after the release of the presidential decree (Post 2). We find that for both of our main

INEFFICIENT PROCUREMENT IN TIMES OF PANDEMIA

13

dependent variables there is a larger and statistically significant effect after the relaxation
of the requirements for the usage of discretionary contracts.
We then study whether the pattern encountered for discretionary contracts can be also
found for competitive procurement, which limits the scope for graft and was not directly
affected by any presidential decree. We find that there is a (marginally) significant decrease
in the usage of this type of contracts in municipalities with a higher baseline corruption index
after the outbreak of the pandemic, while their average value does not differentially increase
in these places (see Table A6 and Figure A6 in the Appendix). This result is important
because it suggests that there is no differential increase, after the arrival of the disease, in
the citizen demand for public services not related to the emergency.
Moreover, using text analysis, we grouped contracts distinguishing between crisis needs
(food and health-related items), versus other contracts. We find that after the first COVID19 case in Colombia municipalities that are one-standard-deviation more likely to be corrupt
at baseline experience an increase in the average value of crisis-related contracts of 7% (see
Column 1 of Table 3 and panels C to E of Figure 1). Moreover, when we divide the post
COVID-19 period into Post 1 and Post 2, the size of the effect doubles to 13% (Column 2).
When we split contracts between food and health-related purchases, we find that most of
the effect is driven by a large increase in the value of food-related items in municipalities
predicted to be more corrupt at baseline. These results go in line with the evidence which
suggests that malfeasance was mainly driven by cost overruns in the acquisition of food relief.
Finally, we corroborate whether the effect of baseline corruption on discretion during
the pandemic is exacerbated or attenuated by key political characteristics of municipalities, namely: i) Presence of anticorruption agencies (i.e. number of offices of the Inspector
General); ii) Political affinity with the President (i.e. the mayor’s party); iii) Presence of
the media (i.e. number of radio stations). Table A9 shows that there are robust heterogeneous effects only in the case of the presence of anticorruption authorities, in line with the
evidence that suggests that top-down accountability is key to containing this phenomenon
(Olken, 2007; Avis et al., 2018).

5.5. Is it Corruption? At this point, it is natural to ask whether our empirical results
necessarily imply that corruption increased due to the pandemic. As we recognized in the
introduction to this paper, we do not have a smoking gun allowing us to verify, with an
absolute level of certainty, that acts of corruption were in fact committed in Colombian
municipalities. In some cases, discretion may simply imply waste and inefficiency. In other
cases, it may be even desirable (Decarolis et al., 2020). Nevertheless, in this subsection we
present suggestive evidence consistent with the fact that after the outbreak of COVID-19
in Colombia, places with higher levels of baseline corruption showed a greater number of
irregularities in public procurement. For this purpose, we use information from judicial
investigations carried out during the pandemic by an anti-corruption agency, data on campaign donations in the 2019 local elections, and information from SECOP on contracts that
required extensions (in time or money) after being awarded.
First, we had confidential access to the classified information on the cross section of municipalities that, as of June 2020, had received at least one alert for cost overruns during the
pandemic from the Office of the Comptroller General, the independent government institution in charge of the fiscal control in the country. Column 1 of Table 4 shows the results of
cross-sectional regressions in which we assess the correlation between our estimated baseline
corruption measure and the probability of receiving an alert from the Comptroller’s Office,
controlling for baseline characteristics and department fixed effects. The correlation is positive, statistically significant and large. A one standard deviation increase in the corruption
index is associated with a probability of receiving an alert 7.5 percentage points higher,
which represents a 63% increase with respect to the mean for this outcome. Although this
evidence is only suggestive and correlational, it indicates that during the pandemic, contracts
with cost overruns were mainly awarded in places that have historically been more corrupt
according to our measure.18
18In Table A7 of the Appendix we re-estimate the main results dropping from our sample all the municipalities

identified by the Office of the Comptroller General as having cost overruns in public procurement. The
results are largely unchanged which suggest that our results are not driven by these municipalities and so
our predicted baseline corruption index explains the use of discretionary contracts and other inefficiencies in
public procurement above and beyond the areas flagged by this control agency.

Next, using information from the National Electoral Council, we identified all natural and
legal persons who were campaign donors in the 2019 local elections and who received a contract during 2020. There is an empirical literature that shows that the allocation of contracts
to campaign donors is often associated with favoritism (Baranek and Titl, 2020; Baltrunaite,
2020), inefficiency (Mironov and Zhuravskaya, 2016; Ruiz, 2017; Gulzar et al., 2021), and
corruption (Fazekas and Cingolani, 2017; Hummel et al., 2019). In fact, Gulzar et al. (2020)
show that in Colombia, “donors to mayoral campaigns are typically local business owners
seeking to gain preferential treatment in public procurement assignment.” Using a differencein-difference specification, Table 4 presents evidence that after the arrival of COVID-19 to
the country, the allocation to campaign donors of contracts of any type (Column 2), and
of direct contracts (Column 3), increases more in municipalities with higher levels of baseline corruption.19 An additional standard deviation in the corruption index increases the
probability of awarding any type of contract and a direct contract to a campaign donor in
approximately one percentage point.
Finally, we use information provided by SECOP that proxies for the quality of a contract,
specifically over costs and time extensions with respect to the original budget and the timeline initially established. These measures are certainly proxies of inefficiency (what Bandiera
et al. (2009) call passive waste), and tend to correlate positively with corruption (Bandiera
et al., 2009; DalBo et al., 2013; Gallego et al., 2020; Bosio et al., 2020). As before, using a
difference-in-difference specification, Columns 4-9 of Table 4 show that, after the arrival of
COVID-19, the increase in over costs and time extensions in direct contracts, and to buy
food and health-related items, is greater in municipalities with higher baseline corruption.
Column 4 (7) shows, for instance, that an additional standard deviation in baseline corruption increases the probability of having a direct contract with over costs (time extensions)
in 1.2 (2.4) percentage points. This is a very large effect, equivalent to 50% (92%) of the
mean of the dependent variable. The coefficients are also always significant for contracts to
procure food and health-related items.
19Note

that in this specification, and the next one, we collapse the data before and after the first COVID-19
case to deal with the sparsity in the dependent variable.

16

In sum, although proving waste and corruption is hard, the evidence presented in this
section shows that after the arrival of COVID-19 in Colombia, contracts are more likely to
have judicially proven cost overruns, to be assigned to campaign donors, and to report over
costs and time extensions in places with higher baseline levels of corruption.
6. Conclusion
This paper documents that in Colombia the spending rush led by COVID-19 differentially
increased more the usage and value of discretionary procurement contracts in places initially
more likely to be corrupt. Moreover, we find that in the post-pandemic period, contracts
signed in these places are more likely to have judicially-proven cost overruns, be awarded
to campaign donors, and exhibit implementation inefficiencies often linked to malfeasance.
Our findings have important policy implications. In order to curb the potential negative
effects of the relaxation of contracting procedures in terms of waste and graft, top-down
accountability tools such as audits—which have proven effective in other contexts (Olken,
2007; Avis et al., 2018)—should accompany the relaxation of contracting rules. More transparency, coupled with technology and data science, could also help reducing inefficiency and
corruption. Ultimately, in these contexts, preventing corruption may well save lives.

Notes: This table presents the results from the main specification in equation (4.1). Corrupt is a standardized version of the predicted probability of corruption.
Post outbreak takes the value one after the first case of COVID-19 in Colombia. Baseline controls include population, population density, and a poverty index all
of them interacted with week fixed effects. Columns 1 and 2 run our main regression for 2019 using the same time frame. In this case the Post outbreak dummy
takes the value one after week 10. Columns 3 and 4 present the main results using standard errors that control for spatial and first-order time correlation (see
Conley, 1999, Conley, 2016). We allow spatial correlation to extend to up to 279 km from each municipality’s centroid to ensure that each municipality has at least
one neighbor. Columns 5 and 6 collapse the data to pre and post COVID-19 outbreak. Column 7 uses as dependent variable the hyperbolic sine transformation
of average contract amount. Columns 8 and 9 use as our treatment variable the transparency index IGA, while columns 10 and 11 use the institutional capacity
index IDI. Standard errors are computed using wild bootstrap and clustered at the municipality level. * is significant at the 10% level, ** is significant at the 5%

Online Appendix
Appendix A. Construction of the Municipality Corruption Index
To construct our predicted baseline corruption measure, we use a total of 147 municipalitylevel predictors. Each variable corresponds to one of the following ten categories: financial
sector, conflict, crime, human capital, local politics, public sector, local demographics, economic activity, illegal activity, and natural resources. For the outcome variable used to train
the models, we construct a dummy variable indicating if the mayor of each municipality was
prosecuted by this anti-corruption agency in the 2008-2011 or 2012-2015 mayoral periods.
The information to build this measure comes from the Office of the Inspector General and
was collected by Martinez (2019). Using this outcome variable, and the 147 aforementioned
predictors, we trained four canonical machine learning models for each period of government.
In particular, we trained random forests, gradient boosting machine, neural network, and
lasso. The results are not very different if other algorithms are used instead.
In each case, we follow the following steps:
(1) The dataset is divided into a training set consisting of 70% of the observations and
a testing set with the remaining 30%.
(2) 5-fold cross-validation is performed in the training set in order to select the optimal
combination of parameters for each algorithm and to train the models.
(3) The previous step is repeated 10 times varying randomly the partitions. Hence, 10
optimal sets of parameters are obtained. The final optimal parameter set is the
average of these.
(4) Using this optimal parameters the predictive performance of the models is assessed
in the test set that was not used for training purposes.
(5) Finally, individual models are ensambled using the Super Learner procedure (Van der
Laan et al., 2007; Polley et al., 2011), in order to stack the individual predictions.
We use ensemble methods to finally construct the corruption measure as it is the case that
the combination of different models perform better than their individual components. The
models achieve acceptable levels of predictive performance, with a precision of 84% and an
area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.71. These final models are used to estimate the level
of corruption in each period of government, and the final measure we use is the standardized
average of the score obtained by each municipality in these two periods. The correlation
between the probabilities of each period is quite high (0.7), which suggests that municipal
corruption may be quite persistent over time. This is important for our analysis, because it
implies that the predicted probability of corruption until 2015, can be a good proxy for the
latent probability of corruption in 2020.

Notes: This table presents the results from the main specification in equation (4.1) adding heterogeneous effects. We present three heterogeneous effects: i)
the number of Offices of the Inspector General (columns 1 and 2), ii) a dummy for the mayor being from the same party as the president (columns 3 and 4),
and iii) the number of radio stations in the municipality (columns 5 and 6). Corrupt is a standardized version of the predicted probability of corruption. Post
outbreak takes the value one after the first case of COVID-19 in Colombia. Baseline controls include population, population density, and a poverty index all of
them interacted with week fixed effects. Standard errors are computed using wild bootstrap and clustered at the municipality level. * is significant at the 10%
level, ** is significant at the 5% level, *** is significant at the 1% level.
