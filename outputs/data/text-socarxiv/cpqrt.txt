COVerAGE-JP: COVID-19 Deaths by Age and Sex in Japan
Contributors: Fumiya Uchikoshi
Introduction
This database (https://github.com/fumiyau/COVerAGE-JP) collects COVID-19 deaths by age,
sex, date, and region in Japan. As with other causes of deaths, deaths related to COVID-19 are
reported by local public health center (Hokenjo), which is located in every prefecture and major
metropolitan/large cities.1 47 prefectures and some metropolitan cities then collect the
information about COVID-19 cases and deaths to report the Ministry of Health, Labour, and
Welfare (MHLW). Although MHLW provides a summary statistics about the COVID-19 cases
and deaths on their webpage,2 the distribution broken down by age and sex is not available, that
leads many volunteering organizations to collect COVID-19 information based on
prefectural/municipality reports. These databases are provided by, for example, NHK (Nihon
Hoso Kyokai, Japan’s public broadcasting association),3 Toyo Keizai Shimpo,4 J.A.G. Japan,5 or
National Institute of Population and Social Security Research.6 However, even these databases
do not provide COVID-19 deaths by age and sex. This database thus aims to fill in the gap by
collecting COVID-19 related deaths reported by various sources as I discuss below, including
prefectures’ press releases or media sources.
Data sources
Collection of data sources
Information about COVID-19 deaths is based on periodic reports by prefectures, major
metropolitan cities, and news sources. The priority was given to the local government’s website
to see if there are any COVID-19 deaths reported. Some prefectures with larger COVID-19
cases, like Tokyo, Osaka or Hokkaido, release daily reports on cases and deaths with information
about the date of death, age, sex. Other prefectures, where the number of COVID-19 deaths
tends to be small, deliver a daily briefing but do not necessarily upload their press release online.
This leads to the value to look at media sources based on the prefectural or municipality
briefings.
For these prefectures, I collected death information about COVID-19 cases from news
sources. Priorities are local newspapers, followed by NHK and other major newspapers like

As of 2020, there are 469 public health centers. The detailed history of this public health
institution is summarized by Katsuda (2011). Links to each local public health center is available
at the MHLW’s webpage

Asahi Shimbun. In collecting information, I tried to omit news sources published in news
aggregators (like Yahoo Japan which often makes older articles not available after a short period
of time). The list of references used to construct the database is provided in Table 1. After
creating the database where the unit is based on individuals, I aggregated the data by date
(occurrence and reporting), age, sex, and region (prefecture). With information for cases, the data
are integrated into a cross-national comparative project on COVID-19 cases and deaths by age
and sex, COVerAGE-DB. 7
Illustration: What we can do by using the data
One advantage of the Japanese data is the availability of region-specific, although the definition
of deaths is not necessarily consistent across municipalities as one of the major national
newspapers in Japan reported based on their survey for municipalities with COVID-19 deaths.8
To take this advantage, as an illustration of the data, this section presents how (1) the number of
deaths, (2) the proportion of deaths among those aged 70 or over, and (3) sex ratio of COVID-19
deaths differ across regions. Maps with jiscode to identify each prefecture with its name and
tables for outcomes examined here are provided in appendix Figure 1 and Table 1.
Figure 1 shows the geographical distribution of COVID-19 related deaths in Japan (as of
June 19, 2020). As we can see, many prefectures report no COVID-19 deaths so far, while deaths
are concentrated in a few prefectures like Tokyo (313 deaths), 9 Hokkaido (94 deaths), or
Kanagawa (94 deaths), Osaka (84 deaths) or Saitama (51 deaths). While the population for these
prefectures is relatively larger except for Hokkaido (13 million for Tokyo, 9 million for
Kanagawa and Osaka, 7.2 million for Saitama, and 5.5 million for Hokkaido), which explains the
number of COVID-19 deaths relative to that of other prefectures, other few prefectures like
Ishikawa (27 deaths) or Toyama (22 deaths) had a relatively larger number of COVID-19 deaths
despite their smaller number of population (about 1 million). According to news reports, a
majority of deaths in these prefectures are clustered in one location; 21 out of 27 deaths in
Ishikawa were patients at a hospital where the outbreak occurred in late April,10 and 14 out of 22
deaths in Toyama were residents in a geriatric health care facility (roken), one of the long-term
care facilities.11
The concentration of deaths in hospitals or long-term care facilities results in a larger
proportion of older people among the COVID-19 deaths, as Figure 2 presents. 81.5% of deaths in
Ishikawa or 91% of deaths in Toyama are people aged 70 or over, while the proportion of these
older people among the COVID-19 deaths tends to be smaller in Tokyo (72%), Hokkaido (71%),
or Saitama (65%). Outbreaks in these facilities were also reported in other prefectures with a
larger share of older people in COVID-19 deaths like Fukuoka or Gunma. As studies on other
countries noted, residents in care homes or patients in hospitals are at high risk of fatality due to

Several deaths in Tokyo are omitted because they do not record either the date of death or the
date of occurrence. The same procedure was applied to other prefectures but the lack of reporting
date is especially the case for Tokyo.

the COVID-19, the geographical difference in the share of older people in the COVID-19 deaths
suggests that outbreaks in these settings play an important role in explaining the variation of
COVID-19 outcomes across places, especially ones where major outbreaks do not happen.
One important demographic context in these facilities, especially for the long-term care
facilities is a larger share of women, because of the longer life expectancy of women over men.
About two-thirds of care home residents are women in the United States (Center for Disease
Control 2019), while the share of women tends to be larger (77%) in Japan (Ministry of Health,
Labour, and Welfare 2016). While numerous studies pointed out that men are more likely to die
due to the COVID-19 than women, this suggests that the larger share of COVID-19 deaths in
care home settings results in a relatively lower share of men among the deaths. Figure 3 presents
that this is the case, as prefectures with a larger share of COVID-19 deaths in care homes or
hospitals tend to have a lower sex ratio (men relative to women) of the COVID-19 deaths (1 for
Ishikawa and 0.9 for Toyama). In contrast, the sex ratio tends to be higher in Saitama (2.5),
Hokkaido (1.96), Osaka, (1.69), Tokyo (1.59) which are characterized by a larger number
COVID-19 deaths and deaths reported in various settings.
As these results presented, COVID-19 deaths broken down by age, sex, and regions
provide important insights into understanding the variations in the COVID-19 outcomes.
Another advantage of this database is that it reports the daily cumulative number of deaths, so
researchers can examine, for example, whether the distribution of deaths changes with time.
