The intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19: Stated preferences before
vaccines were available

Abstract
The goal of this note is to better understand determinants that can explain the willingness to vaccinate
against COVID-19. For this purpose, we conduct a survey in Germany in which we ask ourselves whether
this “time is different” from the willingness to be vaccinated against infection by influenza viruses. Our
sample does not only comprise students with and without healthcare background, we also analyze a notable
amount of healthcare professionals. We find that healthcare professionals exhibit a considerably greater
willingness to vaccinate against flu than healthcare and non-healthcare students. In contrast, the willingness
to vaccinate against COVID-19 is quite similar among the populations. In both contexts, COVID-19 and
flu, trust (e.g. media, activities of the government) seems to play a central role in the decision whether to
vaccinate or not.

Introduction

During the course of the COVID‑19 pandemic, the world has faced a race to develop a vaccine to protect
people and to return to something resembling a normal life. People anticipated vaccine shortages and ethical
debates arose about the global vaccine allocation (Emanuel et al. 2020; STIKO 2020). As a consequence,
many countries purchased millions of doses of potential vaccines, which was intensified by, for example,
the US election campaign in 2020. However, it is necessary but not sufficient that vaccines are safe and
effective—people must also be willing to be vaccinated. De Figueiredo et al. (2020) estimate global trends
in vaccine confidence in a large-scale study for 149 countries between 2015 and 2019. They argue that
there is growing evidence that the willingness to vaccinate is reduced or delayed because of a lack of trust
in relevance, safety, and efficacy of vaccines. Therefore, it is no surprise that the WHO declared vaccine
hesitancy as one of the ten biggest global health threats in 2019 (WHO-Online 2019). What’s about the
willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19? Neumann-Böhme et al. (2020) analyze the willingness to
be vaccinated between 2 and 15 April 2020 in a multi-country European study. The authors find that a
relatively high proportion of the population being opposed to a COVID-19 vaccination are located in
Germany: 10% of the respondents refuse vaccination and 20% are unsure. Respondents from Italy, United
Kingdom, Netherlands, and other countries stated a higher willingness to be vaccinated. There is a plenty
of reasons why people may refuse vaccination. For example, Carrieri et al. (2019) emphasize the
distribution of false news stories. According to Baumgaertner et al. (2018), ideology influences who we
trust in and, accordingly, what information we rely on.

The goal of this note is to better understand determinants that can explain the willingness to vaccinate
against COVID-19. For this purpose, we conduct a survey in Germany in which we ask ourselves whether
this “time is different” from the willingness to be vaccinated against infection by influenza viruses. On the
one hand, both COVID-19 and flu have the same main risk group (i.e., elderly people and people with
underlying diseases). On the other hand, COVID-19 is entirely new, whereas flu is a more known and
seasonal phenomenon. Moreover, we add value to the literature by considering a wide range of subjects,
some of which with training in medicine. Our sample does not only comprise students with and without
healthcare background, we also analyze a notably amount of healthcare professionals (most notably
physicians).

Data and Methods

Variable of interest, constructs, and approach to data analysis
To analyze the willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and flu, we consider the constructs
population, risk group, anxiety, trust, and other variables. We are interested in university students who are
enrolled in medicine or a healthcare degree program (Healthcare students) and university students who are
not (Non-healthcare students). Moreover, we want to learn something about people who are working in the
healthcare sector (Healthcare professionals). Variables to capture risk group include the current health
status (Health), suppression of one’s immune system (Immunosuppression), suppression of the immune
system of a family member (Immunosuppression family), whether there are people over 60 years living in
the household (Household > 60), and smoking activity (Smoker). Anxiety includes fears about health threats
(Worry virus) and whether subjects increasingly use homeopathy or naturopathy (Reaction homeopathy).
Trust is measured via the general trust in media (Trust in media), trust in the information received from the
government (Statement government), and trust in the German healthcare system (Quality health system).
The other variables are CRT, Residence (capturing the main residence of the subjects), and Gender (gender
of the subjects). The cognitive reflection test (CRT), which was introduced by Frederick (2005), measures
the extent to which people engage in analytical thinking. A high score in this test is associated with
reflective thinking, whereas a low score indicates intuitive thinking.
Since our dependent variables are binary, we estimate logit regressions. To interpret the results
meaningfully, we provide average marginal effects (cf., Cameron and Trivedi 2010).
Recruitment of the subjects
The recruitment of the subjects was carried out in the period 18.5.2020-2.8.2020. During this period, no
vaccine against corona was approved for full use (according to “Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker.”1). The
respondents were recruited as follows: We have contacted the deans/deans of studies as well as several
professors and lecturers of different degree programs of the largest universities in Germany (with spite to
the number of students) and asked to advertise our study. To our surprise, many of them also joined the
study. The healthcare professionals were recruited via the publicly available physician lists of the
Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians of various federal states of Germany. Our total sample
comprises 2,077 subjects. Of them a total of 1,249 subjects identified themselves as non- healthcare students
and 208 as healthcare students. We recruited 213 healthcare professionals (of which 128 subjects associated
themselves as a physician) and 367 professionals of the non-healthcare sector.

Results

In Table 1, we depict the respondents’ stated willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and flu. The
willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 is relatively homogeneous across the respective
populations.2 In contrast, the willingness to be vaccinated against flu is considerably higher among the
healthcare professionals.

The regression results to explain the willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 (panel I) and flu (panel II)
are summarized in Table 2. As indicated above, we find that healthcare professionals are more willing to
be vaccinated against flu. The differences among the populations in the willingness to be vaccinated against
COVID-19 seem to be negligible. The higher the respondents rate their health status, the lower is the
willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Its effect size is small and seems to vanish in the context
of flu vaccination. If the respondents’ immune system or the immune system of a person from the close
family is weakened the more likely the respondents are to intend to be vaccinated. The effect size reveals,
however, that it seems to matter only in the context of flu. Whether there are people over 60 in the household
or not does not seem to play a role in both panels. The same holds for smoking activities. The more
respondents fear health threats due to the virus, the higher is the willingness to vaccinate (both against
COVID-19 and flu). The more respondents use homeopathy or naturopathy, the less likely is the intention
to be vaccinated in both panels. Trust seems to play an important role. The more respondents trust in the
mass media, health-related information from the government, and the German healthcare system in general,
the more positive they are towards vaccination. The willingness the think deliberately is positively
associated with the willingness to be vaccinated in both panels. Interestingly, people from East Germany
reveal a higher willingness to be vaccinated against flu, but not against COVID-19. The willingness to be
vaccinated is higher for men than for women. The effect is more pronounced in the context of flu.

In an open question, we asked the subjects who refuse to vaccinate against COVID-19 to give reasons. In total, we received 272 answers.
The most frequent answers given by healthcare students, non-healthcare students, and healthcare professionals were lack of knowledge (e.g.
only short-term research available, lack of evidence, unknown long term consequences, lack of experiences, shorted approval procedure) and
very low risk for themselves (e.g. trust in own immune system, no risk group, no severe consequences after infection to be expected).

(1) We control for education, age, daily media consumption, and the date when the subjects joined the study.
(2) We lost a couple of subjects because the question whether there are people older than 60 in the household was not answered by all subjects.

Discussion

We find that healthcare professionals exhibit a considerably greater willingness to vaccinate against flu
than healthcare and non-healthcare students. In contrast, the willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 is
quite similar among the populations. In both contexts, COVID-19 and flu, trust (e.g. media, activities of
the government) seems to play a central role in the decision whether to vaccinate or not. If our results are
robust, there are a number of policy implications linked to trust. A high level of willingness to vaccinate
presupposes trust in media and state institutions. It is therefore important to communicate information in
an accessible, transparent, and comprehensible manner and, if necessary, to combat false news stories.
However, our study suffers from some drawbacks. We do not have a representative sample and, therefore,
the findings should be considered as preliminary.
