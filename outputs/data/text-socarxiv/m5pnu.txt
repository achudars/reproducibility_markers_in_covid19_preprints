Abstract

It is possible to follow an ideal vaccination global strategy, that will reduce to the minimum the
number of infected and dead by COVID-19 as well as the likelihood of an escape mutant. This
ideal vaccination strategy needs of a high degree of international cooperation among di erent
countries. International initiatives as COVAX, advocated by the WHO, try to achieve such goal.
However, in the present scenario with limited number of vaccine doses, Game Theory model also
predicts that they are becoming goods subject to the Tragedy of the Commons. Countries with
the capability to control vaccine dose distribution will desert from the international agreements,
vaccinating

rst to their own nationals. If such behaviour is known by other countries (as is

happening now) more countries will be tempted to desert as well. Eventually it will end in a Nash
equilibrium, which stops the ideal vaccination strategy. Furthermore, in poorer countries, with
great di culties to get access to vaccine doses, these will be transformed into Gi en goods.
Vaccination data available to date, show that we are in a scenario where vaccine doses have
transformed into goods subject to the Tragedy of the Commons, countries desert from
cooperation reaching a Nash equilibrium and vaccine doses are close to become a Gi en good
for the poorer countries. This dynamic will not only rise the number of infected and dead by
COVID-19, but also the likelihood of an escape mutant (in the SARS-CoV-2 populations) will be
increased. If, eventually, this turns out to be the new scenario new vaccines could be developed
for those new escape mutant strains, going back to a very similar setting as the starting one. Most
likely, the world will reach a Pareto optimality (equilibrium between desertion and cooperation)
due the pressure of those who seek high levels of cooperation to attain a global vaccination
strategy.

Key words: escape mutant, COVID-19 vaccines, Tragedy of the Commons, Nash equilibrium,
Gi en goods.

1. Introduction
Through mankind’s evolutionary history many viruses managed to jump from animals to humans1.
Once they go through the animal-human barrier, these zoonotic viruses tend to wash mankind for
centuries in successive waves2. Fortunately, science development makes possible that we can,
somehow, control these pandemics with antiviral drugs and vaccines.
In 2019 SARS-CoV-2 could trespass animal-human barrier causing a catastrophic pandemic, it
has proven to be a quick evolving virus and the arising of an escape mutant is certainly a potential
risk3. Since COVID-19 is a global pandemic, only a global adequate vaccination strategy can
minimize the likelihood of an escape mutant3.
This is the reason why around 180 countries, with the support of the World Health Organisation,
have signed the COVAX initiative to jointly negotiate the purchase and distribution of vaccine
doses against SARS-CoV-24. This initiative is an attempt to maximize the e ectiveness of global
vaccination4.
There is a risk that, despite these international cooperation e orts, some countries are tempted to
desert from this initiative trying to accumulate vaccines. In this sense, the United Nations (UN)
alerts that the “progress in vaccination is wildly uneven and unfair” pointing out that only ten
countries have administered 75% of all COVID-19 vaccine doses while over 130 countries have
not received a single dose5.
The risk of "vaccine nationalism" grows6. The WHO is pessimistic about the future of vaccination,
stating that “the world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure - and the price of this failure
will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world's poorest countries”7,8. A "me- rst" approach
would be self-defeating because it would push up prices and encourage hoarding. 'Greed' and
'capitalism' helped UK's vaccines success, says premier B. Johnson. "Ultimately, these actions
will only prolong the pandemic, the restrictions needed to contain it, and human and economic
su ering”7,8. These concerns are shared by important economic agents that believe that without a
global and complete control of COVID-19, economic recovery could be compromised9.
In this context we estimate the costs and bene ts of the di erent vaccination strategies, using
Game theory. This mathematical approach shows that it is possible to follow an ideal global
vaccination strategy, that will reduce to the minimum the number of infected and dead by
COVID-19 as well as the likelihood of an escape mutant. However, Game theory also predicts that
the shortage of vaccine doses will make them a good subject to the tragedy of the commons10,11.
It is highly probable that the di erent vaccination strategies reach a Nash equilibrium12,13. The
best general outcome would be that every country cooperated in a global vaccination strategy,
but each country knows what strategy the others are following, so with that information he adapts
its own strategy to what believes is best for its own interests and doing so deserts from the
cooperative strategy. Finally, there is a great added risk that vaccines end up as Gi en goods for
the poorer countries14
These will signi cantly reduce the e ectiveness of the vaccination programs, what could allow
natural selection to favour an escape mutant.

2. Theoretical background
2.1. Conditions for the COVID-19 vaccines to become a good subject to the Tragedy of
the Commons.
Since Game Theory, Tragedy of the Commons10,11 can be explained as a non-cooperative game in
which all players share a common good14–18.
James G. Hardin (1968), in one of his most in uential papers, showed that when several
individuals act upon: i) a limited resource, ii) irrationally, iii) driven only by personal interests and iv)
independently from one another, in a long term, they end by destroying the shared common good,
even though is not advisable for none of them (nor individually nor collectively) the destruction of
that limited common good11
In its classical example, a group of cattle breeders share common pastures. Each farmer tries to
maximize its pro t and wonders: What bene t do I get by adding one animal more to my cattle
that I keep in the common pasture? The bene t is having one extra animal because the owner
gets all the production of that added one. The cost of adding one more animal is a function of the
common pasture destruction due to that one animal overuse. Because the e ects of the overuse
are shared by all cattle breeders that exploit the common pasture, its cost is signi cantly lesser
than the bene t. Adding costs and bene ts, a rational farmer concludes that it is in his interest to
add another animal to his cattle, and why not another? and one more? and another?...
Each and every one of the “rational” cattle breeders that share the common pasture come to the
same conclusion. In the end all of them participate in a game that makes them increase their herd
unlimitedly. But because the pasture is limited, they end destroying the common good. It was no
one’s intention, each of them was freely managing a common good pursuing their best interests
but is precisely that freedom what is unfavourable to all of them.
In a classic payo matrix (Table 1) when all players (cattle farmers) cooperate and use fairly the
common good (only one animal per farmer) all get the same reward (+1).
If player One decides to increase his reward (adding one more animal) he gets a reward of nearly
2 (2 − e) because adding that new animal generates some costs that are shared by all players
including himself. The other players will receive a reward slightly below 1

(1 − e) because they

also assume part of the added animal cost but get no reward. In the end all players will desert
although the nal result is a cero reward for everyone.

In COVID-19 pandemic, the limited resource is the vaccine.
There is an ideal vaccines distribution among the di erent countries, that would maximize the
global bene t minimizing the total number of infected and dead by SARS-CoV-2. At the same
time, it would minimize the likelihood of a new mutant strain emerging that could evade vaccines
and spread around the globe causing a new wave within the already vaccinated. This ideal
distribution can be designed using minimax strategies developed in Game theory, but countries
must cooperate.
However, some of the countries that control vaccine production and distribution could be tempted
to desert from this common vaccination strategy, increasing the number of doses they reserve for
their own nationals. As this position wide spreads vaccine doses could become a good subject to
the tragedy of the commons.

2.2. Scenario in which the di erent countries, with their COVID-19 vaccination strategy,
could reach a Nash equilibrium
In Game Theory, Nash equilibrium gives the best outcome when: i) all players know each other’s
strategy; ii) each player knows his best strategy; and iii) each player is following his best strategy.
At this point they reach equilibrium because each individual player is playing with his best
possible strategy, knowing what the others do19–21. Furthermore, each individual player cannot
increase his winnings changing his strategy if the others do not modify their own. Consequently,
players do not have incentives to change strategy. But in a Nash equilibrium the outcome is not
the best group result, is only the best possible result for each of them individually. The outcome
could be better for everyone if all players coordinated a common strategy.
The easiest example of the Nash equilibrium is in a modi cation of the prisoner’s dilemma, when
both know what the other is going to do. In the classic prisoner’s dilemma police arrest two
suspects from a recent robbery. Without solid evidence against them they decide to interrogate
the suspects separately. The robbers have three options: a) if both suspects cooperate and none
of them confesses, police cannot put charges against them and both have to be released; b) If
one of them deserts from the cooperative strategy and confesses that it was his partner who did
the robbery, he will be released and the other will go to jail; c) nally, if both confess, both will go
to jail but with a reduction in the sentence for cooperating with the police. It would be best for
both if they cooperate and none confesses, but if they only seek personal interest and do not trust
each other both should adopt the desert strategy, which will end in an equilibrium in which losses
are minimized for each of them.
Applying complex prisoner’s dilemma models that allow multiple players or repeating the game
numerous times, cooperative strategy always maximizes gains for everyone, and desert strategy
minimizes individual losses when players do not know what others will do.
It is a well-known fact that several countries that control vaccine production and distribution have
already deserted from a common vaccination strategy. Once these desertions are known by
everyone, to those other countries that have access to a great number of doses the temptation to

desert increases. In doing so, the real global vaccine dose distribution could reach a Nash
equilibrium, with a very di erent outcome than with the ideal one that could minimize the number
of infected and dead and reduce the likelihood of an escape mutant.

2.3.

Conditions for the COVID-19 vaccine doses become Gi en goods in the poorer

countries
In a market economy, the normal thing is that as the price of a certain good increases, its demand
by consumers decreases, this is the Law of Demand. The opposite situation, in which consumers
respond to an increase in price of a certain good by demanding more of it is known as Gi en
behaviour and the good is known as a Gi en good22
In the following equation,

Φ = Φh − bΦr
(Eq. 1)
where:

Φ is the total e ect = price elasticity of demand
Φh is the Hicksian demand = substitution e ect or price elasticity compensated (i.e., elasticity of
demand due to variation on the price, excluding the income e ect and maintaining the utility
function constant)

b is the budged allocated for the good
and Φr the elasticity of the resources (being bΦr the income e ect).
Developing the equation:

(δx /δp1) = (δh1 /δp1) − x(δx /δI )
(Eq. 2)

(δx /δp2) = (δh 2 /δp2) − y(δy/δI )
(Eq. 3)
Eq. 2 represents the direct e ect (due to the change in the price of x)
Eq. 3 represents the crossover e ect (due to change in the price of y)
where:

x = good representing the demand of the basic good.
y = good representing the demand of the wealthy good
p1 = price of x
p2 = price of y
h1 = Hicksian demand of x
h 2 = Hicksian demand of y

I = income = p1x1 + p2 x2

Then:
Total e ect (TE) represents the global variation of the demand in such circumstances.
Substitution e ect (SE) is the e ect derived from the variance of the price of a good that conducts
to a decrease of the demand of that good and increase of other, change the interchange rate.
Always acts in opposite direction of the energetic price.
Income e ect (IE) is the e ect derived from the variance in purchasing potential, the real income.
It acts in opposite direction of the energetic price for common goods and in the same direction of
the energetic price for inferior goods.
The conditions for a Gi en good are:

SE ≤ 0 and IE > 0
with
h
(bϕr > ϕ ); ϕ > 0

(Eq. 4)
3. Practical application

In order to verify if Covid-19 vaccines could become a good subject to the Tragedy of the
commons we used the number of vaccines produced to date by the pharmaceutical companies
as well as with an estimate of the future production23,24. We compare these data with the
estimated need25 and form these gures we estimate most likely values for the payo matrix.
To verify if the vaccination strategies countries follow could reach a Nash equilibrium we use in
our calculations, the number of vaccine doses countries have allocated to vaccinate its
nationals24,26 and the number of doses that have reached COVAX initiative23. We also examined to
what extent this information is of public domain27.
To verify if vaccines could be Gi en goods for poorer countries we check di erences in vaccine
doses price for di erent countries23,24,26.

4. Results

4.1. Why COVID-19 have already become a good subject to the Tragedy of the common
Worlds demand greatly exceeds actual production23. In a very optimistic scenario at least 5,400
million people should be vaccinated, some of the current vaccines need two doses for
immunization. But these gures can be greater if people have to be revaccinated after a period of
time or if SARS-CoV-2 variants arise that escape the current vaccines and new ones have to be
produced.

Nowadays, the vaccine production capability is limited, but companies expect to meet demand,
with production estimates for 2021. P zer expects to produce 1.3 billion doses28, Moderna hopes
for a number of doses in the range between 700 million and 1billion29, while AstraZeneca
anticipates they can produce 3billion Covid-19 vaccine doses30.
Under these circumstances, a country with the opportunity to decide over the destination of the
vaccines (whether because it produces them or because has a great purchase capability) will be
tempted to increase its bene t by keeping more vaccines than the ones he is entitled to according
to the ideal global distribution. If a country keeps one million more vaccine doses, many of its
citizens will sooner return to a normal life, but why not keeping another million, and one more, and
another, …? And if one country does it, why not another country, and another, and one more, …?
In the end, every country capable of deciding over the vaccines will stockpile much more doses
than the ones entitled to, following the ideal distribution. The consequence is that the ideal
distribution will not happen and the minimizing e ect of infected and dead will not be, and the
likelihood of a new SARS-CoV-2 strain more dangerous will not be reduced.
Countries less in uential will not have enough vaccine doses to follow an adequate vaccination
strategy and will be forced to make decisions that could favour natural selection of mutants that
evade the vaccine protection (e.g., one dose vaccination, vaccinating during a high prevalence
wave, slow vaccination programs, …), If a mutant that evades vaccines emerges, the common
good (the vaccines) would be destroyed (they would be useless for that escape mutant). The
payo matrix for the COVID-19 vaccines (common good) is resumed in Table 2. This table 2 also
shows an attempt gure of the number of years it will take (with the di erent strategies) to control
the COVID-19 pandemic in the best and worst scenario. It is assumed that in the event of
countries that can decide upon vaccines they desert, then the likelihood of an escape mutant
increases.

strategy. t: time the pandemic could be defeated; co: cost for a country to cooperate; bo: deserting

Is in the power of those countries that can decide the destination of the vaccine doses that
vaccination becomes or not a scenario of the tragedy of the commons. If these countries
cooperate, they will overcome COVID-19 pandemic later but the risk of emergence of a new
mutant that evades vaccination will be low. If they desert, they will be over the pandemic sooner
than if they cooperate, but the likelihood of an escape mutant increases signi cantly.

4.2. Why Vaccine doses global distribution is reaching a Nash equilibrium
Vaccine dose distribution is variable, while Israel has received 8,731,727 doses and has
vaccinated to a 100,9% of its population, some countries have not yet received a single dose31.
Table 3 shows a list of those countries that have already gone beyond the 10% mark of its
population with at least one dose of a vaccine.

Table 3. List of countries that have administered more doses, in total and per 100 population (as

In this setting, when a country (with the possibility to control production and distribution of
vaccine doses) knows that others desert, his best strategy will be to desert as well, securing
enough vaccine doses supply for his nationals.
Every country knows that this strategy is worst from a global perspective, because it gives the
virus a greater chance of producing an escape mutant but known what others have done is his
best option.
Table 4 shows a payo

matrix of di erent cooperation and desert settings for COVID-19

pandemic ideal vaccine dose distribution, that would minimize total number of infected and dead
and the likelihood of emergence of an escape mutant strain. In it we can analyse conditions for a
Nash equilibrium.
The key that some of the strategies reach a Nash equilibrium solely depends on those countries
with decision capability over vaccine doses destination. If these countries desert from the
common strategy they will overcome the COVID-19 pandemic sooner, temptation is too big. If one
deserts and others know, then temptation for these ones is too big as well. If all of them desert,
the world will reach a Nash equilibrium and in return mankind takes the risk of the emergence (in
one of those countries with no decision power) of a new mutant that evades vaccines and
spreads around the world, going back to starting point.

4.3. Why COVID-19 vaccine will be a Gi en good for the poorer countries
Countries are paying di erent price for the same vaccine, some poor countries are paying even
more than many richer countries23,24

Gi en good is summarized in Figure 1. As shown in the gure, vaccine doses will become a Gi en

and none of them alone will be enough to satisfy total demand.

5. Discussion

Countries as di erent as New Zealand, Taiwan, Australia or Vietnam showed that COVID-19
pandemic could have been controlled with classic epidemiological strategies (mobility restrictions,
tracking contacts, infected isolation, quarantines, facemasks, hygiene, …). Unfortunately, majority
of countries failed to implement adequate strategies and SARS-CoV-2 became a global
pandemic. At present times, most countries base all their hopes to control the pandemic in the
e ectiveness of vaccines and vaccination.
We need to follow a good vaccination strategy if we want to minimize the number of infected and
dead, avoid the likelihood of escaping mutants, overcome the COVID-19 pandemic as soon as
possible and prevent that SARS-CoV-2 stays among us for decades32. This ideal vaccination
strategy exists33,34 Several mathematical models and recursive algorithms, including classic
minimax strategies from Game theory, would allow fully optimize the vaccination strategy35–37.
International cooperation is needed, in order to really implement this ideal vaccination strategy,
between those countries with the capability to control vaccine doses (either because they
produce them or because they have enough money to buy them) and those other countries
uncapable to do so. With this idea in mind the COVAX initiative was born, advocated by the World

ff

ff

ff

11

poorer countries, trying to maximize the e ectiveness of a global vaccination4. A great degree of
international cooperation is needed for this global vaccination strategy to be successful,
minimizing the number of infected and dead and reducing the likelihood of a mutant strain arising
that could evade the vaccine.
However, while COVID-19 vaccine doses continue to be a scarce good, a global vaccination
strategy will face many hurdles. It is not easy that a rich country shares millions of vaccine doses
with poorer countries, especially if many of its inhabitants are yet to be vaccinated, the temptation
to desert from this international cooperation initiative is considerable. Although UN is warning that
we are witnessing a worrisome “vaccine nationalism” that will be counterproductive to all, the “me
rst” temptation is substantial.
In that respect, COVID-19 vaccines can be considered as a common good and subsequently be
subject to the Tragedy of the Commons11. Temptation to desert is signi cant and Game theory
predicts that it is most likely it will happen38. In fact such desertion has already happened, a
number of organizations are warning that richer countries are hoarding more than 99% of the
vaccine doses39,40. Given that the decision of some countries to desert from cooperating and
follow a “me rst” strategy is well known, temptation for the remaining ones increases. Given that
many others have deserted, the best individual strategy for those countries that can obtain
vaccine doses is to desert too.
In line with afore mentioned, the ideal conditions to reach a Nash equilibrium are met. Every
player knows each other’s strategy and in that generalized desertion setting, their best strategy is
to desert as well. Obviously, every country (if capable) end following the best single strategy for
him. No country can increase its gains changing strategy while the other countries abide to their
own. Alas, with this Nash equilibrium the number of infected and dead is not minimized, nor is the
likelihood of an escape mutant arising.
In this “every man for himself” setting there is an added problem: As prices di erent countries are
paying for the vaccine doses against SARS-CoV-2 are known, it becomes clear that the
pharmaceutical industry is charging di erently, to di erent clients, for the same product27. For
example, US pays for the Moderna’s vaccine doses 15 US dollars, Europe $18 and Israel
$23.5027. Although it may seem a contradiction, commonly, poorer countries pay higher prices
than richer ones for the same product (e.g., South Africa pays $5,25 for Astra Zeneca’s vaccine
doses while Europe buys it for $2,15)27. We are at risk that vaccines end being Gi en goods for
poorer countries.
The conditions under which Gi en behaviours can occur have been a subject of debate in
economics41–44. The consensus is, that only subsistence goods as basic food or drugs that
people in extreme poverty and with a very limited budget need, can become Gi en goods that
their demand increases as the price goes up45–48. After all, the poorer consumers only have
access to a very small number of goods with a limited supply. Gi en behaviour generally takes
place locally, rather than globally47. For example, Jensen and Mille45–47 describe the generation of
Gi en behaviour among people in extreme poverty from the province of Hunan (China), regarding

Health Organisation, to achieve an e ective distribution of COVID-19 vaccine doses among the

the acquisition of rice and noodles. Gi en behaviour not only a ects humans. This same conduct
has been demonstrated in animals, rigorous experimental studies have shown it in rats and
pigeons48,49. The same behaviour has been observed in the wild in conditions of food scarcity
with the sardines and is favoured by the action of natural selection32.
In those countries that vaccines can turn into Gi en goods, the e cacy of vaccination will be
reduced because they will be forced to follow de cient vaccination strategies that could lead to
selection of escape mutants that can put at risk the e ectiveness of current vaccines. Developed
countries will answer to that new scenario developing new vaccines for those new mutant escape
strains.
We would go back to a similar situation as before, there could be an ideal vaccination strategy
(that could minimize the number of infected and dead caused by these new SARS-CoV-2 escape
variants) but for that it would be necessary an international cooperation between those countries
that control the new vaccines and those that do not. Once again, vaccine doses could be
common goods subject to the Tragedy of the Commons, temptation to desert from a cooperative
strategy will increase, those who desert would be known, a Nash equilibrium would be reached
and for poorer countries vaccine doses would turn into Gi en goods. We could enter an in nite
circle that would assure that SARS-CoV-2 would stay for decades.
What is the likelihood? We need to look into the dynamics of the occurrence of the mutation
process. Luria & Delbruck (1943)50 in his work -worthy of a noble prize- proved that mutations
happen pre-selectively, pre-adaptatively and in a general way. Mutants arise randomly as simple
natural stochastic mistakes during the genome replication. They happen before natural selection
acts and not as a consequence of it, mutations have no purpose. Numerous early researchers’
work con rmed Luria & Delbruck’s work (i.e., Newcombe, 1949; Novick & Szilard, 1950;
Lederberg & Lederberg, 1952)51–53, others more recently have also proved them right. For
example, in microorganism populations spontaneously and recurringly arise new mutant strains,
resistant to substances of late synthesis even before industry used them54,55,64,56–63 or of military
use never seen in nature before65 or radioisotopes of nuclear industry66–69.
These mutants can increase their frequency or be removed from the populations by the e ect of
natural selection and genetic drift70–74. Frequently these mutants are deleterious and will be
removed by natural selection, but because of mutation being a recurrent process they will
constantly emerge, remaining at a low frequencies thanks to mutation-selection equilibrium38,73.
For those selectively neutral mutants is mutation-drift what maintains the balance38,75. If suddenly
there is a drastic change in the environmental conditions (e.g., volcanic eruptions, industrial
catastrophes, …) some of these resistant strains can

nd the right conditions to become

dominant in the population71,72,74–78.
Something similar can happen with the escape mutants. If random mutations can produce them,
it is certain then (since the mighty size of SARS-CoV-2 population) that they have already
happened. However, considering the speci c characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 population
genetics, for these escape mutants to have a high likelihood of xing within the population they
need a tremendous selective advantage (close to 50%)3. Most likely, before massive vaccination

takes place, these escape mutants will have less tness and will be at very low numbers due to
mutation-selection equilibrium.
The problem will come when poorer countries do not vaccinate extensively their people because
they do not have enough doses. In this setting, those low frequency escape mutants will have a
chance. Predictions about COVID-19 pandemic duration show that it may be enough time for an
escape mutant to spread79,80. The vaccination strategy followed in poorer countries will determine
if the likelihood of escape mutants spreading is minimized or not.
Most likely, vaccine dose distribution will follow a mixed model, not a complete cooperation nor a
total desertion setting. Most countries that control vaccine doses will solve primarily their own
situation (as Israel or United Arab Emirates are doing) but will also allocate part of those doses for
countries in need. As it happens with a number of human economic activities, it is probable that
vaccine dose distribution follows a power law like Pareto distribution, with a 80:20 ratio
cooperation-desertion81–86. This is obviously not an ideal vaccine dose distribution but somehow
reduces the likelihood of an escape mutant.
Despite everything, face to face with the deserting temptation we must not forget that SARSCoV-2 escape mutants could already be within the population. If richer countries do not
cooperate the virus will have the opportunity to stay with us for a long time.
