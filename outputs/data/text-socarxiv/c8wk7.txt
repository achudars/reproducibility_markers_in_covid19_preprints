Abstract: Drawing on data from the firm-level Survey of Business Uncertainty, we present three
pieces of evidence that COVID-19 is a persistent reallocation shock. First, rates of excess job and
sales reallocation over 24-month periods have risen sharply since the pandemic struck, especially
for sales. We compute these rates by aggregating over monthly firm-level observations that look
back 12 months and ahead 12 months. Second, as of December 2020, firm-level forecasts of sales
revenue growth over the next year imply a continuation of recent changes, not a reversal. Third,
COVID-19 shifted relative employment growth trends in favor of industries with a high capacity
of employees to work from home, and against those with a low capacity.

COVID-19 and policy responses to the pandemic have generated massive shifts in demand
across businesses and industries. Barrero, Bloom, and Davis (forthcoming) provide evidence on
the near, medium, and longer-term reallocative effects of these shifts for the US economy based
on data as of Summer 2020. Their evidence points to a major upheaval in labor markets (see also
Cajner et al., 2020), initially depressed and later heightened business formation rates (see also
Haltiwanger, 2020), high expected job and sales reallocation rates in the wake of the pandemic,
and a huge shift to working from home (see also Brynjolfsson et al., 2020, Bick et al., 2020, and
Ozimek, 2020). The evidence aligns well with reports of strong growth among firms and industries
that benefitted from the pandemic – e.g., e-commerce and retail giants like Amazon and Walmart
(Bender and Dalton, 2020; Mitchell, 2020) – even as much of the economy faltered. It also
underscores the relevance of theoretical analyses that highlight macroeconomic implications of
shocks with large, sharply uneven demand and supply effects (e.g., Guerrieri et al., 2020).
In this paper, we draw on firm-level data in the Atlanta Fed/Chicago Booth/Stanford
Survey of Business Uncertainty (SBU) to quantify the pace of reallocation across firms before and
after the pandemic struck, to investigate what firm-level forecasts in December 2020 say about
expected future sales, and to examine how industry-level employment trends relate to the capacity
of employees to work from home. The SBU is a monthly panel survey of U.S. business executives
that collects data on own-firm past, current, and expected future sales and employment. The
Atlanta Fed recruits high-level executives to join the panel and sends them the survey via email,
obtaining about 450 responses per month. The survey yields data on realized firm-level
employment and sales growth rates over the preceding twelve months and subjective forecast

distributions over own-firm growth rates at a one-year look-ahead horizon.1 See Altig et al. (2020)
for more information about the SBU and an analysis of the firm-level forecast properties.
We report three pieces of evidence on the persistent reallocative effects of the COVID-19
shock. First, rates of excess job and sales reallocation over 24-month periods have risen sharply
since the pandemic struck, especially for sales. We compute these rates by aggregating over
monthly firm-level observations that look back 12 months and ahead 12 months. We focus on rates
of “excess” reallocation, which adjust for net changes in aggregate activity. Second, as of
December 2020, firm-level forecasts of sales revenue growth over the next year imply a
continuation of recent changes, not a reversal. Firms hit most negatively during the pandemic
expect (on average) to grow slowly if they grow at all in 2021, and firms hit positively expect to
continue growing. Third, our survey data say that COVID-19 shifted relative employment growth
trends in favor of industries with a high capacity of employees to work from home, as measured
by Dingel and Neiman (2020a), and against industries with a low capacity.
For each firm 𝑖 in survey month t, we compute the firm’s realized plus expected
24
employment growth rate over a 24-month period centered on the survey month: 𝑔𝑖,𝑡
= 𝑔𝑖,𝑡,𝑡−12 +

E𝑖,𝑡 𝑔𝑖,𝑡,𝑡+12, where E𝑖,𝑡 denotes the firm’s subjective expectation at t.2 We then compute the
expected excess job reallocation rate in month t as

where the first term on the right side is the expected gross job destruction rate over the 24 months
centered at 𝑡, the second term is the expected gross job creation rate, and the third term is the

More precisely, the look-ahead horizon is twelve months for employment and four quarters for sales revenue.
We measure growth rates as arc-percentage changes, given by 𝑔𝑖,𝑡,𝑡−12 = (𝑥𝑖,𝑡 − 𝑥𝑖,𝑡−12 )/(0.5𝑥𝑖,𝑡 + 0.5𝑥𝑖,𝑡−12 ),
where 𝑥𝑖,𝑡 is the level of activity (sales or employment) at firm 𝑖 in month t and analogously for E𝑖,𝑡 𝑔𝑖,𝑡,𝑡+12 .

absolute value of the expected net growth rate. The factor (𝑧𝑖𝑡 /𝑍𝑡 ) is the ratio of firm 𝑖’s
24,𝑗𝑜𝑏𝑠

employment weight 𝑧𝑖𝑡 to aggregate activity 𝑍𝑡 .3 The resulting 𝑋𝑡

statistic quantifies the

volume of cross-firm job reallocation in excess of what’s required by the aggregate net change.
We compute the expected excess sales reallocation rate in the same way.4
Figure 1 plots the excess reallocation rates from January 2017 to December 2020 based on
24-month firm-level changes, as described above. The excess sales reallocation measure rises very
sharply upon arrival of the COVID-19 shock in March 2020, and it continues on an upward
trajectory through the end of 2020. As of December 2020, the centered 24-month expected sales
reallocation rate exceeds 12 percent of aggregate sales. The job reallocation measure shows a more
modest rise that also continues through the end of 2020. The upward trajectories in both series
indicate that the reallocative effects of the pandemic are continuing to unfold and even accelerate.5
Since the pandemic had yet to hit by December 2019, the last month covered by our 12-month
look-back interval, Figure 1 also suggests that COVID-19 has reinforced firm-level trends that
were already underway before the pandemic.
To examine whether firms expect a (perhaps partial) reversal of pandemic-induced shocks
to their sales revenues, we now consider how expected future sales growth rates in December 2020
vary by quantiles in the distribution of realized growth rates over the preceding 12 months.
Specifically, in each month 𝑡 starting in September 2016, we compute sales-weighted 10th, 25th,
50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of the realized sales growth rate distribution in the year leading up
Specifically, 𝑧𝑖𝑡 ≡ 0.5𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑖,𝑡−12 + 0.5𝐸(𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑖,𝑡+12 ) and 𝑍𝑡 ≡ ∑𝑖 𝑧𝑖𝑡 . See Davis and Haltiwanger (1999) on the
excess reallocation formula and the choice of weights. In practice, we winsorize 𝑧𝑖𝑡 at 500. We also winsorize past
and expected future employment growth rates (before adding them) at the 1st and 99th percentiles of the distribution
of realized and expected employment growth rates, following Altig et al. (2020).
4
For sales, we winsorize 𝑧𝑖𝑡 at the 85th percentile of its distribution in the pooled sample from September 2016 to
April 2020, and we winsorize the sales growth rate values in the same manner as the employment growth rates.
5
Barrero, Bloom, and Davis (forthcoming) document a COVID-induced jump in expected excess reallocation rates
using firm-level forecasts at a 12-month horizon. Relative to their evidence, Figure 1 uses realized plus expected
firm-level changes over 24-month intervals and data that extend through December 2020.

to 𝑡. Then, in December 2020, the most recent survey month, we compute the average salesweighted growth rate forecast (looking one year ahead) among firms within plus or minus five
percentiles in the realized growth rate distribution.
Figure 2 plots percentiles of the realized one-year sales growth rate distribution from
September 2016 through December 2020, and it appends the average one-year-ahead growth rate
forecasts by percentile for the period from December 2020 to December 2021. The figure makes
several points. First, the COVID-19 shock dramatically increased the dispersion of realized firmlevel growth rates. Second, this increased dispersion mainly involved lower growth rates in the
bottom part of the distribution (the 25th and 10th percentiles). Third, the growth rate distribution
narrowed after May 2020 but remained highly dispersed at the end of 2020. Notably, realized
twelve-month growth rates in December 2020 were minus 10 percent at the 25th percentile and
minus 28 percent at the 10th percentile. Fourth, and perhaps most striking, percentile-specific
forecasts in December 2020 imply a continuation of pandemic-related shifts in sales revenue across
firms, not a reversal. This result is seen in the positive growth rate forecasts among firms at the
90th and 75th percentiles of the realized growth rate distribution and the lower to nil growth rate
forecasts for firms at the 25th and, especially, 10th percentiles of the realized growth rate
distribution. Although the forecasts imply a narrowing of the growth rate distribution, Figure 2
yields no evidence of a systematic reversal in firm-level fortunes during 2021 that would partly
unwind the changes that took place in the twelve months leading up to December 2020.
Perhaps firms over extrapolate from their experiences during COVID, and that is what we
capture in the final data point in Figure 2. Specifically, firms may be biased towards forecasting
future sales developments that resemble recent past experience. Barrero (2020) finds evidence of
over extrapolation in pre-pandemic SBU data, as do Gennaioli, Ma, and Shleifer (2016) based on

4

separate survey evidence for publicly-traded firms. Only time will tell whether over extrapolation
in the SBU data on firm-level expectations formed in December 2020 is driving the apparent
absence of systematic reversal effects in Figure 2.
Figures 1 and 2 indicate that COVID-19 is a persistent reallocation shock in two senses:
First, firm-level outcomes and forecasts continue to show high rates of (expected) reallocation.
Second, firm-level forecasts as of December 2020 show no evidence of a systematic reversal in
the pandemic-driven shifts in sales across firms. However, these two figures say little about the
specific direction or nature of reallocative shifts across firms. To make some progress in this
direction, we now consider how industry-level employment shifts relate to employee capacity to
work from home. Barrero, Bloom, and Davis (2020) provide evidence and analysis that working
from home will persist after the pandemic ends. So, it seems plausible that industry-level shifts
associated with working from home will persist as well.
We use firm-level data from the SBU to compute the employment-weighted average of
past plus expected future employment growth rates for fourteen broad industry groups. We
consider two separate periods comprising months before and during the COVID-19 pandemic –
September 2016 to February 2020, and March to December 2020, respectively. We obtain
estimates from Dingel and Neiman (2020b) for the fraction of workers in each industry that are
able to work from home. They consider how easy it is to work from home in each occupation based
on task requirements, and how many workers a given industry employs in each occupation.
Figure 3 shows that relative employment growth trends shifted towards industries with a
high capacity of employees to work from home (WFH). We sort industries by the share of
employees who can work from home. Employees in Leisure and Hospitality have little capacity to
work from home, while those in Finance & Insurance or Education have high capacity. The figure

5

plots past plus expected future employment growth rates for each industry during the pre-COVID
and COVID periods. To construct these measures, we first compute realized plus expected growth
rates over 24-month intervals centered on the survey month, as before. We then aggregate over
firms to the industry level using firm-level employment weights.
The figure shows that industry employment growth trends are essentially uncorrelated with
WFH capacity in the pre-COVID period. In contrast, they are strongly positively correlated with
WFH capacity during the COVID period. The cross-industry correlation between the realized plus
expected employment growth rate and WFH capacity is -0.04 in the pre-COVID period and 0.71
in the COVID period. See Papanikolaou and Schmidt (2020) for complementary evidence based
on the relationship between industry-level stock returns and WFH capacity.
In summary, Figures 1 to 3 provide evidence that COVID-19 is a persistent reallocation
shock. Firm-level data on past plus expected future growth rates point to high and rising rates of
excess job and (especially) sales reallocation since the pandemic struck. As of December 2020,
firms also foresee a continuation of COVID-induced sales reallocation effects over the next one
year, not a reversal. Firms growing the most during 2020 foresee stronger growth in 2021, and
vice versa for those with the sharpest revenue drops in 2020. Finally, COVID has shifted relative
employment growth trends in favor of industries with a high WFH capacity and away from those
with low WHF capacity. Although we cannot measure it using our data, this effect almost certainly
operates within our broad industry groups as well. Evidence in Barrero, Bloom and Davis (2020)
that working from home will stick after the pandemic ends, coupled with differences in WFH
capacity across firms and industries, is another reason to think that COVID-19 is a persistent
reallocation shock.

Notes: Industry groups are sorted by WFH capacity, from lowest to highest. For each industry
group, we start with monthly observations on firm-level growth rates in the past 12 months and
expected growth rates in the next 12 months. We then aggregate over firms to the industry level
separately for the pre-COVID (9/2016–2/2020) and COVID (3/2020–12/2020) periods. Then we
plot the average growth rate for each industry in the two periods.
