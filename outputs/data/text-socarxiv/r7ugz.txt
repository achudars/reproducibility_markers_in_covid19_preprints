of families with children in Austria: Evidence from the first ten months of the crisis

Abstract
Objective: This study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the employment situation
of parents and in turn on the subjective financial well-being of families with children in Austria.
Background: The pandemic had strong repercussions on the Austrian labour market. The short-time
work (STW) programme covered a third of employees in the first half of 2020 and helped to maintain
employment levels. We provide evidence on how an unprecedented labour market crisis of this sort
and in particular the exceptionally wide use of STW had affected the (gendered) employment situation
of parents and the financial well-being of different types of families.
Method: The study draws on representative panel survey data that cover 905 families with underage
children. The data include information on the employment situation and financial well-being of single
and cohabiting parents before the onset of the crisis, three months and ten months after its onset.
Results: In contrast to other countries, mothers were not more strongly affected by the labour market
crisis of 2020 than childless women or fathers. About a third of couples with underage children
experienced income losses. Despite the wide use of STW and government support to families, the
share of families in financial difficulties has substantially increased, especially among those with many
children and single parents, many of who were at risk of poverty already before the crisis.
Conclusion: Substantial shares of dual-earner families that had low poverty risks before the crisis were
in financial difficulties in 2020. Potential spill-over effects of financial shocks on children are discussed.

1 Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic had strong repercussions on the Austrian labour market. Starting with March
2020, a variety of measures have been introduced to contain the spread of the virus and to mitigate
the economic impacts of the containment measures (e.g. the lock-downs), that severely restricted
economic activities and suddenly endangered substantial numbers of jobs. To counter the rapid rise in
unemployment at the outset of the pandemic, the social partners were quick in designing a generous
short-time work programme (Schnetzer et al., 2020) that was used by a large share of employers and
at its peak in April 2020 covered just below 30% of Austrian employees (Huemer et al., 2021) – a higher
share compared to Germany for instance, where about 15% of employees were short-time workers in
the first phase of the pandemic (Möhring et al., 2020). The extensive use of short-time work in Austria
was effective in keeping the number of crisis-related job losses at bay, with about 5% of those
employed in February 2020 losing their jobs in the first half of 2020 (Vogtenhuber et al., 2021).

Given its wide use, the short-time work programme had a sizeable impact on household incomes in
Austria. Although employees in short-time work received between 80% and 90% of their previous net
salary, the reduction of income associated with short-time work can put the livelihood of low-income
families at risk. Among families with a tight household budget, a longer-term reduction of the
household income by up to 20% may severely reduce financial well-being and heighten risks of financial
deprivation. Moreover, employees in the service industries (e.g., tourism, catering, personal care) lost
larger shares of disposable income when sent into short-time work, due to the omission of income
components such as tips and overtime pay in the calculation of short-time work allowances (Theurl,
2020). On top of short-time work, the rise in unemployment and the loss of income among many of
the self-employed3 had a direct impact on the financial situation of private households (Albacete et al.,
2021). In Austria, unemployment benefits generally amount to 55% of previous net income but can be
higher for those entitled to family supplements (MISSOC, 2020).4 To reduce crisis-related income losses
for those who lost their jobs due to the pandemic, unemployment benefits were topped up by one-off
payments to the unemployed.5 To mitigate the loss of income among the self-employed and families
with children, hardship funds were created (Heitzmann, 2020). Unemployed parents received a bonus
of EUR 100 per child. According to the government, about 90,000 families with underage children and
at least one parent unemployed or in short-time work (eligibility criteria) had received monies from
the hardship fund in 2020 (average amount of EUR 1300 as a lumpsum, cf. APA-OTS, 2021).
To date, there is a dearth of knowledge as to how families have been economically affected by the
COVID-19 crisis in Austria. The available evidence on the effects of the crisis on household incomes is
based on simulation studies that project into the year 2020 (Albacete et al., 2021; Fink et al., 2020) or
on survey data (Kalleitner & Schiestl, 2020; Resch, 2020). These studies are on households more
generally, not on families with children in particular. The present study targets this population group.
It draws on panel survey data from the AKCOVID-project6 that allow for detailed analyses of families
with children of different ages. We study crisis-related changes in parental employment and the
consequences for the subjective financial well-being of families during the first ten months of the
COVID-19 crisis in Austria. We examine the proportion of families in which at least one parent either
lost the job or was registered for short-time work due to the COVID-19 crisis, and what impact these
changes had on the families’ financial well-being. To this end, we combine measures of current
financial well-being at the household level with measures of future expectations and worries.
While studies on the development of household incomes during the 2020 pandemic provide evidence
for a slight reduction in current income inequality between households due to strong state support to
low-income households (Resch 2020 for Austria; Clark et al. 2021 for other countries), we find that the
share of families in financial difficulties had substantially increased as a result of the COVID-19 crisis,
especially among families with small or many children and among single parents, i.e. among family
types that were overrepresented among low-income families and at high risk of poverty already before
the crisis. We present and discuss this prima facie discordance in results between research on the
impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the household income distribution more generally and research on
the impact of the crisis on families more specifically in section 2 that presents an overview of previous
research on the financial well-being of households in times of COVID-19. This is followed by a short

approach and main research hypotheses in section 3. After a description of the data and the analytical

effects of parental job loss and the potential implications of our findings for child well-being.

2 Previous research on financial well-being in times of COVID-19
Types of data and indicators of financial well-being used
Disposable household income is a core objective indicator of financial well-being. Until now, the impact
of the pandemic on household incomes, both nationally and internationally, has mostly been discussed
based on simulations (e.g. Fink et al., 2020; Martin et al., 2020) using pre-crisis data. The few studies
available that have drawn on current data on how household incomes have changed in the course of
the pandemic have tended to use survey data (e.g. Resch, 2020 for Austria; Blom & Möhring, 2021 and;
Kohlrausch et al., 2020 for Germany; Clark et al., 2021 for a comparison of five European countries).
Income data from administrative registers would be preferable given the susceptibility of survey-based
income data to social desirability bias (Angel et al., 2019), yet administrative household income data
will only be available with considerable delay. Moreover, an important advantage of survey data is the
possibility to include subjective indicators of financial well-being (Kempson et al., 2017), allowing for a
multifaceted analysis of financial well-being (Noll, 2013) which accounts for how individuals and
families experience their current financial situation (Brüggen et al., 2017).
Previous findings
Simulations of the impact of the pandemic on disposable household incomes for Austria (Fink et al.,
2020) suggest that the lowest income households were least affected by crisis-related income losses,
because these households have tended to source their income from state transfers already before the
crisis. The level of social security benefits and pension payments has so far not been affected by the
crisis.7 Conversely, absolute and relative income losses were highest in the top income quintiles, partly
because of the lower wage replacement in short-time work for high earners. Similar conclusions have
been drawn by Resch (2020) based on survey data from the Austrian Corona Panel Project. Overall,
these studies show that the lowest income households were most likely to maintain their pre-crisis
income and that the early crisis has thus caused a slight decrease in inequality between households.
Such findings are in line with survey-based international evidence (Clark et al., 2021), estimating that
absolute income inequality between households has declined in 2020 (comparing pre-crisis data with
data from April 2020 until September 2020) in Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden, because policy
responses have been more to the benefit of lower income groups (for similar results Almeida et al.,
2020; Bruckmeier et al., 2020 for Germany).8 In summary, evidence on the impact of the pandemic on
household incomes tends to suggest that the lowest income households, especially those strongly
reliant on transfer income have been shielded from financial crisis effects in 2020.

7

Some government measures have even slightly improved the incomes of the lowest income households (e.g. an increase in
the benefit level of unemployment assistance).
8
Bruckmeier et al. find that in Germany the pandemic had small positive effects on the incomes in the lowest two deciles,
null effects on middle-income households, and small negative effects on the highest income deciles. Findings from a survey
carried out by the Hans-Böckler-foundation (Kohlrausch et al., 2020), by contrast, show that in Germany the lowest income
households were the ones most likely to report income losses. This survey is restricted to respondents who are part of the
active labour force, however, thus not representative of the whole population of private households.

2

The focal group of this study — families with underage children — only represent about a fifth of
private households in Austria (Statistics Austria, 2021a). The income distribution among this group of
households differs from the general distribution of household incomes (e.g. underrepresentation
among the low-income households that were found most likely to have maintained their pre-crisis
income in 2020 according to prior research).9 The extent to which general studies on household
incomes provide relevant background information for our study on families with children is therefore
limited. The available studies do however provide important background information on the financial
situation of different types of families before crisis-onset, from which we can infer families’ risk of
financial hardship if affected by income losses due to the pandemic (i.e. financial vulnerability, cf.
Albacete et al. 2021). We know for instance that single parents are since long overrepresented among
those at risk of poverty. If hit by sudden income losses, most single parents are unable to maintain
their standard of living even in the short-term.
While to date we lack knowledge about the extent to which different types of households have been
affected by crisis-related income losses in Austria, results from the United Kingdom that pertain to the
beginning of the crisis suggest that negative labour market and income shocks were more common
among working parents than among workers without children (Cheng et al. 2021; see also Lofton et al.
2021 for the United States) and most common among low educated parents (Hupkau et al., 2020). In
line with such observations there is evidence for the UK that in April/May 2020 parents tended to be
financially more insecure and distressed than the childless and more pessimistic about their financial
future (Cheng et al., 2021), whereas no such differences by parental status were discernible before the
crisis.
Studies for Austria that focus on subjective indicators of financial well-being in times of COVID-19 so
far analysed all private households and not families with children in particular. They show that in AprilJune 2020 the largest shares of those expecting their financial situation to deteriorate looking three to
twelve months ahead were located in the lowest disposable household income quintile in Austria
(Albacete et al. 2021). These findings point to widespread economic insecurity that mostly affected
the lower income households, even though they were least likely to record losses in disposable income.
This can be explained with reference to wide-spread worries about job losses in the further course of
the pandemic among those still employed (Steiber, 2021) and the fact that once government measures
such as short-time work and temporary tax exemptions are retracted and rent referrals lifted, low
income families are likely to face economic shocks in the further course or aftermath of the pandemic.
To date neither survey data nor studies using administrative data provide insights into the employment
situation of parents and the financial well-being of families in Austria in times of COVID-19. How did
the pandemic affect the employment situation of parents? How do families with children evaluate
their financial well-being in times of crisis? This study aims to answer these questions, taking a
household perspective and using measures of how the financial situation at the household level was
perceived by the individuals sharing their financial resources within the household.

9

Among low-income households (based on equivalized disposable income) that were found most likely to have maintained
their pre-crisis income, single households are overrepresented (Albacete et al. 2021: 119).

3 Background, theory and hypotheses
More than a third of those still employed in February 2020 have been in short-time work or became
unemployed until April 2020 (Vogtenhuber et al., 2021). A simplistic probability calculation — under
the assumption that every employee faced the same risk for these labour market outcomes — implies
that families with two breadwinners were twice as likely to have been affected by such crisis-related
risks compared to single earner families. We may thus expect income losses to have been more
common among dual-earner families that have shown lower risks of poverty before crisis-onset and
conversely less common among those with only one job to lose (single breadwinner families). Given
the preferences to mate with partners who are similar in terms of age and education and thus
potentially also in terms of labour market risks (assortative mating, Greenwood et al. 2014), we may
find an accumulation of the risk of income losses during 2020 at the level of households. The young
population in Austria was the one most strongly affected by the crisis-related labour market risks of
job loss and short-time work (Vogtenhuber et al., 2021). We may thus expect risks of crisis-related
income losses to accumulate among young dual-earner parents in particular (see also Resch 2020).
Yet, to capture the impact of the COVID-19 crisis not only on family incomes but on financial wellbeing, we need to combine families’ differential risks of income losses with their financial vulnerability.
That is, families vary in the degree to which they can cope with financial shocks and thus in terms of
the risk that crisis-related income losses during 2020 threatened their financial well-being (Demertzis
et al., 2020). Albacete et al. (2021) show that households with a particularly low financial margin (i.e.
net income after deducting basic living costs) are those composed of a single parent with dependent
children and those composed by two adults and three or more dependent children. In Austria, these
families can on average (median value) save or spend only EUR 100 a month on additional consumption
(over and above basic needs). Households with two parents and one or two dependent children, by
contrast, have a median financial margin of about EUR 1200 (ibid.). From these estimates, it becomes
clear that single parents and families with many children were, on average, not able to sustain their
standard of living during a period of short-time work, even if that lasted only for several months. Single
parents are furthermore twice as likely to have a negative financial margin (i.e. debts accruing by the
month) compared to two-parent families with dependent children and most of them have barely any
liquid assets (ibid.). Single parents are predominantly mothers and thus additionally disadvantaged by
the gender wage gap. As a consequence, single parents would on average not be able to maintain their
standard of living in the event of a complete income loss for even one month, whereas couples with
up to two children would on average be able to compensate for financial losses by drawing on liquid
assets for 12 months or more and couples with three or more children for about 4 months (median
values in months in the event of a complete income loss).10 Such greater financial vulnerably of families
with single earners or many children are reflected in risk of poverty rates11 before crisis-onset: Based
on yearly incomes in 2019, it has been estimated that 14% of private households in Austria were at risk
of poverty; with particularly high shares of at-risk families among single parents (31%), families with
three or more children (30%, Statistics Austria, 2021b, S. 78) and couples with children that involve a
non-employed mother (more than 20%, Statistics Austria, 2020).

10

For this estimate, Albacete et al. computed a combined indicator of households’ financial margin and their liquid assets to
measure the number of months during which a median household would be able to compensate for financial losses.
11
Definition: someone is at risk of poverty if their equivalized household income is less than 60% of the national median
household income (Statistics Austria, 2021b, S. 16).

In summary, taking a simple risk perspective, we would expect families with two earners to have more
commonly been affected by crisis-related job and income losses than single earner families (hypothesis
1). Accounting for the accumulation of labour market risks at the couple level as a result of assortative
mating, crisis-related losses can furthermore be expected to have occurred at a higher rate in families
with low-educated or young parents who faced the greatest labour market risks (hypothesis 2). Taking
a vulnerability perspective, we would expect single earners to have been more strongly affected by the
crisis in terms of their financial well-being compared to dual-earner families (hypothesis 3), because a
second earner in the household can potentially compensate for financial losses (Thomas & Sawhill,
2005) and because single earner families, in particular single parents, were at a comparatively high risk
of poverty already before the crisis. Moreover, financial vulnerability varies with the number of
children. As more children live in a household, the risk of having insufficient income to cover living
expenses increases (Thiede et al., 2018) and those with three or more children are expected to show
significantly higher vulnerability to financial losses (hypothesis 4). Overall, the crisis is likely to have
increased the share of families at risk of poverty. We would expect the share of families reporting low
financial well-being (i.e. with problems making ends meet, drawing on savings or running into debt to
maintain living standard) to have increased compared to before crisis-onset, with vulnerable family
types likely to have seen the steepest increase in rates of poor financial well-being. Given their financial
vulnerability we would expect family types such as single earner families and those with many children
most likely to worry about their financial future situation, even if not yet affected by financial losses.
Gender perspective
The Austrian labour market is characterized by substantial gender inequalities. The labour market is
segregated, with women and men being concentrated in different occupations and industries. Women
receive lower wages, work part-time more often, and interrupt their careers more frequently in the
context of parenthood (Fritsch, 2018). In 2019, almost every second couple (46%) with children below
age 18 involved a full-time working father and a part-time working mother. In another 27% of families
with underage children, only the father worked. Only in about 17% of families with underage children
both parents worked full-time (Statistics Austria, 2020). At the time of writing, it was still debated
whether the Corona crisis affected women’s employment chances more strongly than those of men.
In contrast to the Great Recession, in this crisis the focus of job losses was less strongly focused on
male dominated sectors of the economy (Alon et al., 2020). Throughout 2020, the crisis had affected
women’s and men’s employment to a rather similar degree in Austria. Compared to 2019, employment
declined by about 2% with negligible gender differences (Bock-Schappelwein, Huemer, et al., 2021).
To date, we lack data in Austria on how the crisis has affected the employment of fathers and mothers.
Evidence from the United States (Lofton et al., 2021; Landivar et al., 2020) shows that at the start of
the pandemic fathers saw their employment fall less than women and childless men and the recovery
of jobs has been more pronounced for men and childless women than for mothers. Similar results have
been reported for the UK (Andrew et al., 2020) and Canada (Fuller & Qian, 2021). We will test if
mothers were more likely to lose their jobs or to register for short-time work (thus to record income
losses) than women as part of childless couples or men also in Austria. In terms of financial well-being,
we focus on measuring subjective well-being at the household level; we do not investigate potential
gender differences in individual financial well-being within households (Knittler & Heuberger, 2018).

4 Data and methods
The study draws on register data (Labour Market Database) on male and female employment and on
survey data. The register data serves to give a first overview of gendered employment risks in this
crisis. For the main part of the analyses, we use a representative longitudinal survey of 2.000 people
aged 20-64 living in Austria (AKCOVID-Survey with two waves of data collection and a retention rate
between waves of 71%). In both waves, data were collected using a mixed mode design with 80% of
respondents taking part in an online survey (CAWI); 20% were interviewed by telephone (CATI). This
design intended to ensure a good representation also of those unable or unwilling to participate in
online surveys. To survey a representative sample of the population aged 20-64, quota sampling has
been applied (population strata defined by gender, age, education, household size, number and age of
children, and NUT2-region). For descriptive analyses, post-stratification weights are applied to reduce
potential sampling errors and non-response bias. Moreover, to control for potential selective attrition
between the waves, longitudinal weights have been constructed using information collected in the
first wave to predict participation in the second wave.12 First wave of data collection took place in June
2020, i.e. three months after the crisis-onset and at a time when the pandemic was temporarily under
control (low infection rates). The second wave of data collection in January 2021 was carried out in the
midst of the third (extended) lockdown (that was in place since mid-November with only a short break
at the end of December) and at a time when the crisis had already lasted ten months. The labour
market crisis had peaked in April 2020 with about one million employees on short-time work (about
30% of employees) and a historical high in terms of the number of people unemployed (an increase by
about 66% compared to March 2020, cf. Huemer et al. 2021). At the time of the first survey, the
number of short-time workers had decreased to about 550.000 (about 14% of employees), at the time
of the second survey it stood at about 300.000 (about 8% of employees; Huemer et al. 2021).
4.1. Defining the sample of analysis
To allow for a detailed analysis of different family constellations, the AKCOVID-study aimed at an overrepresentation of families with children in the panel. We define as families only those living in the same
household and our attention focuses on adults living with at least one underage child (below age 18).
The sample of analysis includes 905 families with underage children (799 cohabiting parents and 106
single parents, Table S1 in supplementary material for description of sample). These can be compared
to 565 cohabiting couples who do not live in the same household with an underage child (‘childless’
couples, who may have older children or children not living in the same household). One person per
household was interviewed and asked about the household’s financial well-being; the employment
situation of the partners was surveyed by proxy.
4.2. Employment situation and income losses
Respondents reported on their own and their partner’s employment situation before and after crisisonset. Combining direct and proxy information on partners’ employment in couples, we can survey
mothers’ and fathers’ employment status in each household. Moreover, we can construct breadwinner
models: We differentiate between dual-earner couples in which both partners were employed just
12

The longitudinal weights account for differential participation in wave 2 based on gender, age, education, employment
status, citizenship, household composition, cohabitation with partner, number/age of children, self-rated health, mental
health, financial well-being, region of residence, and interview mode in the first wave. The variables were entered as
predictors in a logistic regression model predicting participation in wave 2. The inverse predicted probability of participation
was normalized, trimmed and used as a longitudinal weight.

before crisis-onset (February 2020) and male breadwinner households, in which only the man was
employed full-time or self-employed, while the woman was not employed or on parental leave. We
further distinguish cohabiting parents according to their level of education (both high educated/both
low educated based on whether the partners have attained a higher education entrance qualification,
i.e. ‘Matura’ in the Austrian context, which is comparable to the British A-levels).
Whether or not households have experienced income losses until June 2020 (item not included in the
second wave) was measured by agreement on a 5-point scale to the statement "We have to manage
on a lower household income since the start of the Corona crisis" (1-does not apply at all, 2-does not
apply, 3-in part, 4-applies to some degree, 5-applies completely).
4.3. Measures of financial well-being
Individuals evaluate their financial well-being relative to their peers, past experiences, or expectations
for the future (Vera-Toscano et al., 2006). There is little doubt that job insecurity (Choi et al., 2020)
and job loss (O’Neill et al., 2005) can affect perceptions of current financial well-being and expectations
about the future financial situation. Brüggen et al. (2017) define financial well-being as the “perception
of being able to sustain current and anticipated desired living standard and financial freedom”; Prawitz
et al. (2006) as “the level of stress and well-being emanating from one's personal financial condition“.
Objective indicators intend to measure the financial situation of individuals or households, subjective
indicators how it is experienced (Brüggen et al., 2017). We use several items to measure different
dimensions of subjective financial well-being. Drawing on a classical item, included in the European
Social Survey, we tap respondents' feelings about their household income – at the time of the interview
compared to before the crisis in February 2020 (1-living comfortably, 2-coping, 3-difficult to manage,
4-very difficult to manage). We dichotomize such feelings with values of 3 or 4 denoting financial
fragility (Demertzis et al., 2020). We measure financial distress asking if families had to draw on savings
or incur debt to meet living expenses and if families started to miss payments (e.g. failure to pay bills,
rent or mortgages). As financial well-being is also influenced by expectations for the future and job
insecurity, we furthermore examine financial anxiety, i.e., worries about future financial problems as
a result of the crisis using an 11-point scale (0-not at all worried, 10-extremely worried). We
dichotomize such worries, with values of 7 or higher denoting great financial worries.
4.4 Analytical strategy
Our aim is to provide evidence on parental employment and families’ subjective financial well-being in
the first ten months of the COVID-19 crisis. We seek to identify the types of families most at risk of low
financial well-being and thereby indirectly evaluate the degree to which government measures have
mitigated the impact of the labour market crisis on family and child well-being. In a first step, we
analyse the employment situation of parents and how it has changed from February 2020 onwards
(individual-level perspective). We provide a descriptive account of changes over time and carry out
logistic regression analyses to test if the presence of children affected risks of income loss in connection
with job loss or short-time work. In a second step, we move the analysis to the household level and
estimate the risk of having been affected by income loss in connection with job loss or short-time work
in different family constellations. We investigate if the risk of income losses due to job loss or shorttime work was affected by the number of earners in the family and the presence and age of children.
We furthermore differentiate between families with younger and older dependent children. Since
parents of young children tend to be younger themselves, they have been more strongly hit by the
labour market crisis (Vogtenhuber et al., 2021). Third, we cast a more direct look at the share of
families who reported to have lost part of their household income due to the crisis, again differentiated
7

by the number of earners and the number and age of children. Finally, we move to the analysis of
subjective financial well-being at the household level, assuming that resources are shared among
family members. We investigate which family constellations were most at risk of low financial wellbeing due to crisis-related income losses (i.e. those who reported newly emerged difficulties with
manging ends meet; those who used up their savings or started accruing debts; those who started
having difficulties paying their bills). A further dimension of financial well-being that we investigate
pertains to worries about families’ financial future (i.e. worry that the family may still run into
difficulties due to the crisis).

5 Results
5.1 Employment situation and income losses
Individual employment situation of mothers and fathers
As shown by the register data (Table 1), in Austria crisis-related labour market risks in 2020 were rather
similar for women and men. Of all those still employed in February 2020 (100%), about 27% of men
and about 24% of women were in short-time work (STW) in April 2020 and about 6%-7% of each gender
have lost their jobs and became unemployed (UNE). By June 2020, the time of our first wave data
collection, about 16% of men and 14% of women were on STW and 4%-5% were unemployed. Overall,
about 39% of men and 34% of women experienced a spell of STW or UNE in the first half of 2020. In
contrast to other countries, in Austria mothers have not been more strongly affected than the childless
or men. Between crisis-onset and the end of 2020, about 43% of pre-crisis employed men and about
37% of pre-crises employed women had a spell of STW or UNE, irrespective of motherhood status.

Our survey data from June 2020 are close to the register data in terms of employment changes across
2020. Limiting our sample to those employed in February 2020 (aged 20-64), we find that about 17%
of the pre-crisis employed were in STW in June 2020 and about 4% were newly unemployed, with nonsignificant differences between women and men (Steiber, 2021, S. 45).

Using regression analysis on a sample of persons who were in dependent employment in February
2020 (N=1,388), we test separately for men and women how the presence of children affected their
odds of short-time work (STW) or unemployment (UNE) in June 2020. To this end, we compute the
combined risk of STW or UNE in June 2020 and use it as the dependent variable in a logistic regression
model that tests for the impact of the household type (Model 1) and of working hours before crisisonset (full-time versus part-time), controlling for age, education, citizenship, and sector of activity
before the crisis (Model 2 in Table 2). Very much in line with the results from the register data (Table
1), we find no impact of the presence or age of children on labour market risks, either for men or for
women. In a pooled model of women and men, no main effect of gender is found (not shown). Finally,
we also tested for the impact of the number of children (no significant effects, not shown).

Sample: Employees in February 2020, N=741 men and 647 women. Model 2 additionally controls for age, level of education,
citizenship, region and sector of activity (industry). Shown are odds ratios. – too few cases of male single parents.

As illustrated in Fig. 1, the share of mothers working either full-time, part-time or short-time remained
stable at its pre-crisis level. That is, the sum of the shares of mothers in one of these three statuses
was constantly at about 60% from February 2020 through to January 2021. In June 2020, about 12%
of mothers were on short-time work (STW) and this share declined to about 7% by January 2021. The
share of part-time work first declined – concomitant to the rise in STW – but then recovered to the
original level of about 35%-36%. The share of full-time work by contrast, declined from about 25% precrisis to about one fifth throughout the crisis. It thus appears that the return-flows from STW to regular
employment among mothers worked better in case of part-time work. Unless most of those 7% of
working mothers who were in STW in January 2021 will eventually return to full-time work, this may
imply a development to a further spread of part-time work among mothers as a result of the COVID19 crisis. The first half of 2020 also saw a rise in the number of unemployed mothers (from about 4%
to 9% in the first three pandemic months, followed by a decline to about 6%) and a slight decrease in
self-employment and marginal employment (which is in line with official numbers from social security
registers, Bock-Schappelwein et al., 2020; Bock-Schappelwein, Fink, et al., 2021). For a similar analysis
of mothers with younger and older children, see supplementary material.

Figure 1: Parental employment situation pre-crisis, three and ten months after crisis-onset

Sample: Mothers and fathers with children <18 years in February 2020 (N=785 for February and June 2002 and N=529 for
January 2021). As the share of fathers on leave is so small (<1%), they were added to those outside the labour force (OLF).

Changes in the employment situation of fathers are illustrated in the left-hand graph in Fig 1. Among
fathers, the summative share of those working either full-time, part-time or short-time also remained
stable (sum of the shares of fathers in the three statuses at about 77% throughout). Concomitant with
the decreasing use of STW, we could observe a rebound of full-time rates but not a full recovery (drop
from about 73% in February 2020 to about 64% in January 2021). The number of unemployed fathers
increased less strongly than among mothers (plus 2%-points compared to less than one 1%-point).
Employment and income situation of families
In moving from the individual level of parents to the household level, we next investigate the degree
to which crisis-related labour market risks of STW and job loss accumulated at the household level.
The Austrian family hardship fund granted financial support to families with underage children in which
at least one cohabiting parent either lost the job due to the crisis, was sent into STW or had substantial
losses of income from self-employment. Since most of those eligible for hardship funds were parents
experiencing one of the first two risks, we computed a combined risk of STW or job loss (STW/UNE).
In June 2020, in about 19% of single parents and in about 36% of couple households with underage
children at least one parent was either affected by UNE or STW (Table 3). In January 2021, the shares
of those affected had declined by minus 7%-points among single parents and by minus 14%-points
among cohabiting parents. We had expected families with two earners to have faced greater crisisrelated risks of income losses in connection with job loss or STW compared to single earner families
who only had “one job to lose” (hypothesis 1). We find that about a third of families with two employed
parents in February 2020, saw at least one parent lose the job or move to STW by June 2020 (21% in
January 2021). These figures are not substantially higher than on average across all parents. However,
we find heterogeneity within dual-earners: those involving two high-educated parents were less at risk
of income loss due to job loss or STW (21% in June 2020; 8% in January 2021) compared to couples
that involved two low-educated parents (38% in June 2020; 40% in January 2021). This difference is
statistically significant and in line with hypothesis 2 that due to assortative mating, labour market risks
accumulate in certain types of couples. In line with expectations, we also find comparatively high
shares of affected parents among (younger) parents with small children (about 40% compared to 33%
among parents of older children in June 2020, this difference is not statistically significant however).
10

We do not find male breadwinner families less affected than dual earners in June 2020 when about
36% were in STW or UNE (not rendering support to hypothesis 1). Male breadwinner couples are a
select group with heightened labour market risks and these breadwinner models also tend to be
practiced at times when couples have small children (Berghammer, 2014). We do not find significant
differences in the share of affected families by the number or age of children. By January 2021, the
share of families affected either by STW or UNE still amounted to more than a fifth among couples
with underage children (22%). This also applied to those with two employed parents in February 2020,
with a particularly high share of low-educated dual-earners still affected in January 2021 (40%).

Income losses among families
Among cohabiting couples with at least one underage child, about a third (33%) reported in June 2020
that they had to manage on a lower household income compared to just before the crisis (see Fig. 2).
Compared to childless couples (29%), the share of families with crisis-related income losses was
significantly higher among single parents (42%). We find no significant differences between dual earner
and male breadwinner families. Within the subgroup of dual earner parents (both partners employed
just before the crisis), however, we find a significantly higher share of families with income losses
among couples with two low-educated partners compared to those with two high-educated partners
(25% versus 37%). We thus find the largest shares of families with income losses among those who
were already more likely to have low incomes and higher poverty risks before the crisis: single and loweducated parents. No significant differences depending on the age and number of children are found.

5.2 Subjective financial well-being
Feelings about household income: financial fragility
Whereas in February 2020 about 8% of couples with underage children had difficulties managing with
the household income, this share of financially fragile families had increased to about 21% by June
2020 and remained at this elevated level until January 2021 (see Fig. 3). In line with findings for the
United Kingdom (Cheng et al. 2021), we find significantly higher levels of financial fragility for parents
than for childless couples (see Table S2 in the supplementary material). Among couples with underage
children, the largest shares of financially fragile families in June 2020 were those with more than two
children (32%) and single parents (36%), which is in line with hypotheses 3 and 4. Also in line with
hypothesis 3, we generally find higher shares of male breadwinner families compared to dual-earner
parents with difficulties making ends meet. Yet, among the latter, a great deal of heterogeneity is
observed: While in dual earner households with two high-educated parents the financial problems
remained low during the crisis with at most one in ten families having difficulties making ends meet
(10% in June 2020, 4% in January 2021), among low-educated parents this share amounted to about a
fifth. This difference is statistically significant (see Table S2 in supplementary material for significance
tests). Overall, we find those types of families to experience the greatest levels of financial fragility in
times of crisis who were already at a higher risk of poverty before the crisis: single parents and families
with many children. We do however also observe a sizable share of financially fragile families among
those who were relatively well protected from financial hardship before the crisis: dual-earner parents.
Running into debts and failure to meet financial obligations: financial distress
About a quarter of single parents and about a fifth of parental couples had to draw on savings or to
accrue debts due to financial losses since the start of the crisis (Fig. 4, graph on top). Of course, not all
families have savings to fall back on, the share of those who had to go into debt to avoid falling into
arrears will be higher among families with a small financial margin such as single parent families. About
14% of single parents and 8% of couple parents were not able to meet their financial obligations (e.g.,
paying bills, rent or mortgages) in June 2020 (Fig. 4, graph in the middle). By January 2021, about one
in ten families remained in financial distress and reported failure to meet financial obligations. In terms
of subgroup analysis, we find parents of underage children, especially single parents, at higher risk of
financial distress compared to childless couples (Table S2 in supplementary material). Moreover, we
find a significantly higher risk of financial distress (drawing on savings or accruing debt to maintain
living standard) among low-educated compared to high-educated dual-earner parents (about 21% and
12% respectively in June 2020, see Table S2) and it appeared that male breadwinner families did see
less of an improvement in their financial well-being until January 2021 compared to other family types.

Worries about the financial future: financial anxiety
Even if not all families had already experienced financial losses due to the COVID-19 crisis, financial
anxiety was wide-spread in 2020: about every third family with children strongly worried about their
financial situation in the further course or aftermath of the pandemic (Fig. 4, graph at the bottom).
Such financial anxiety was found to be more strongly pronounced among families with children than
among childless couples (Fig. 6). No significant differences could be found depending on the number
or age of children (see Table S2 for significance tests). In couple households with underage children,
low educated dual-earner couples (about 30% in June 2020) and male breadwinner families (29%) were
found to face significantly greater levels of financial future worries than high-educated dual earner
parents (17%). While the concerns of the latter, which were already less pronounced in June 2020,
decreased slightly until January 2021 (from 17% to 13%), those of the low-educated two-earner and
male breadwinner households remained at the level of summer 2020. In summary, families' financial
future worries were not just short-lived after crisis-onset but persisted after policymakers had already
taken fiscal action to contain the financial fallout from the crisis (e.g. hardship funds, etc.).

6 Conclusion and discussion
This study provided evidence on how the COVID-19 labour market crisis in Austria had affected the
(gendered) employment situation of parents and the financial well-being of different types of families
in the first ten months of the crisis. Parental employment rates remained relatively stable at pre-crisis
levels, mainly due to the wide use of short-time work (STW). In contrast to other countries, mothers
in Austria were not more strongly affected by the labour market crisis of 2020 than fathers or childless
women. Time will tell if, how and when those who were still on short-time work in January 2021 will
return to regular employment. So far, employment flows suggest that returns to regular employment
worked better for part-time employed mothers than for those working full-time.
Although the STW programme was able to keep job and income losses at bay, the labour market crisis
already had a stark impact on household incomes. About 36% of couples with underage children were
affected by STW or job loss in the first half of 2020. Consequently, about a third of parental couples
experienced income losses, with particularly higher shares among low-educated dual earners (37%)
compared to high-educated dual earning parents (25%). The situation of single parents appears more
complex, about a fifth of single parents were affected by STW or job loss, yet more than 40% reported
crisis-related income losses in June 2020. Part of the explanation may lie in marginal employment that
pays up to EUR 461 per month and tends to be used to supplement insufficient family income. Those
on such mini-jobs were not eligible for STW and thus many of these jobs were lost during the crisis.
Although income from marginal employment can be essential for maintaining their standard of living
among many families, the loss of such jobs was not compensated by hardship funds.
Despite the wide use of STW and government support to families affected by crisis-related income
losses, the share of families in financial difficulties has substantially increased, especially among those
with many children and single parents, many of whom were at risk of poverty already before the crisis.
Although the use of STW decreased significantly over the course of 2020, many families were still in
financial distress or worried about their financial future in January 2021. The financial support was thus
not able to shield all families equally from income losses. The persistence of financial distress highlights
the longer-term impact of the financial shock resulting from STW and UNE on household budgets.
Not only those families who were at risk of poverty already before the crisis were affected by financial
distress due to the COVID19 crisis. Sizeable shares of dual-earner families with children, who appeared
relatively well protected from financial hardship experienced a cut in their household income, had to
draw on savings or accrue debt to compensate for the income losses and worried about their future
financial situation, especially among lower educated dual-earners and single male breadwinners.
Overall, we may see at risk of poverty rates increase in Austria in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis,
as predicted by Dawid (2020) and Heitzmann (2020). This poses risks not only for the parents who are
directly affected by labour market dislocations, but also for the welfare of their children (Misra et al.
2012) and children’s educational outcomes (Hupkau et al. 2020) - key variables in the intergenerational
transmission of disadvantage. Labour market shocks that affect parents not only undermine parents’
ability to meet financial obligations but also their well-being and mental health, especially since these
shocks occurred in times of a ‘care crisis’ and of frequent school closures that additionally burdened
the time and mental resources of parents. While in this study we have looked at the economic effects
of the pandemic on families and their financial well-being at the household level, it will be important
to track the longer-term as well as intergenerational consequences of the pandemic.
