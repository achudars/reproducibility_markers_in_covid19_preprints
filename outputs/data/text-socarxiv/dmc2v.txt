Abstract
This study analyses COVID-19 mortality at the local authority level in England. The dependent variable is
the age-standardised COVID-19 mortality rate. Two separate analyses are reported: one using
untransformed variables, and one using logged variables (where appropriate). In the former, five variables
explain 73% of the variance in COVID-19 mortality rate: cumulative confirmed cases rate, population
density, % black or Asian, average household size, and deprivation index. In the latter, four variables
explain 72% of the variance in log COVID-19 mortality rate: log cumulative confirmed cases rate, log %
black or Asian, average household size, and deprivation index. (A health index does not reach statistical
significance in either analysis, most likely because it is somewhat crude and the dependent variable is agestandardised.) Cumulative confirmed cases rate, average household size and % black or Asian are the
strongest and most consistent predictors of COVID-19 mortality.

1. Introduction
On 12 June 2020, the UK’s Office for National Statistics published estimates of the age-standardised
mortality rate for COVID-19 at the local authority level in England and Wales (ONS, 2020a; and see ONS,
2020b). These estimates correspond to deaths that occurred between 1 March and 31 May. For the purpose
of analysis, they were linked with data from other sources. Identifying the area-level predictors of COVID19 mortality is important for understanding the epidemiology of the disease. Note that Rose et al. (2020)
have already performed an area-level analysis of COVID-19 mortality, based on estimates they derived
using data from NHS trusts. They ran negative binomial regression models, and found that % BAME (black,
Asian and minority ethnic) and % deprivation were robust predictors of COVID-19 mortality. Population
density did not reach statistical significance in their models. However, it can be instructive for different
researchers to analyse the same phenomenon, since they may make different methodological choices, and
may therefore reach different overall conclusions. The purpose of the present study was to examine
predictors of COVID-19 at the local authority level in England.

2. Analysis
2.1. Data and measures
Estimates of the age-standardised mortality rate for COVID-19 were linked to data on the cumulative
confirmed cases rate from the UK government’s coronavirus dashboard (UK Government, 2020). These
estimates are updated daily, but are only available for England. Values on 21 April were taken for analysis.2
The estimates of COVID-19 mortality were also linked to data from the 2011 UK census and the Office for
National Statistics (ONS, 2012; ONS, 2018). Specifically, the following variables were obtained: population
density; % black or Asian; average household size; % in multi-generational households; % unemployed; %
with no qualifications; % in routine occupations; % single parent households; gross disposable household
income per capita; % reporting bad health; and % with an activity-limiting disability. (Note that, in this
context, ‘Asian’ refers to Britons of Indian, Bangladeshi or Pakistani origin.) After merging the data, all local
authorities with a missing value on any variable were deleted. The final dataset contained 292
observations, which represents 90% of the local authorities in England.
The two measures of health (% with bad health, and % with a disability) were combined into a
crude index of health using principal components analysis. (The first principal component explained 94%
of the variance.) Likewise, the five measures of deprivation (% unemployed, % with no qualifications, % in
routine occupations, % single parent households, and gross disposable household income per capita) were
combined into an index of socio-economic deprivation using principal components analysis. (The first
principal component explained 68% of the variance.) Note that four extreme values of gross disposable
household income per capita were winsorized prior to analysis.
These data are not available for other parts of the United Kingdom. Extracting more recent values led to an
unacceptable loss of observations when merging data. Note that the daily number of confirmed cases peaked on 7 April.

At the local authority level, COVID-19 mortality has a mean of 81 (per 100,000) and a standard
deviation of 36. A map showing the distribution of COVID-19 mortality across local authorities in England
is given in Figure 1. The most obvious pattern is that mortality is higher in urban areas, particularly in the
capital city of London.

2.2. Analysis using untransformed variables
Since some of the variables were skewed, two separate analyses were undertaken: one using
untransformed variables, and one using logged variables. This sub-section reports the former. A correlation
matrix is given in Table 1. The correlations of the predictor variables with COVID-19 mortality rate are
shown in the first column. % black or Asian has the strongest association, followed by cumulative
confirmed cases rate and % in multi-generational households. The deprivation index has a weak positive
association with COVID-19 mortality rate, while the health index has a weak negative association with
COVID-19 mortality rate. The latter result is most likely attributable to the crudeness of the health index,
as well as the fact that COVID-19 mortality rate is standardised for age, meaning that it already captures
most or all of the variance associated with long-term health conditions. Average household size and
population density have moderate-to-strong, positive associations with COVID-19 mortality rate.
Some other results of interest are as follows. % black or Asian has a very strong association with
% multi-generational households, and has a strong association with average household size. The health
index and the deprivation index are strongly associated with one another. Scatterplots of the relationships
between predictor variables and COVID-19 mortality rate are given in Figure 2.

COVID-19 mortality across local authorities: cumulative confirmed cases rate; population density; % black
or Asian; average household size; and deprivation index. All five associations make theoretical sense.
COVID-19 mortality is higher where there are more cases of COVID-19, where there are more people per
square kilometre (leading to higher transmission), where there are more black and Asian people (who are
believed to have an elevated risk of death from COVID-19), where the average household size is greater
(leading to higher transmission), and where the level of deprivation is greater (leading to higher
transmission and/or risk of death).

It is somewhat surprising that population density and average household size reach significance when
cumulative confirmed cases rate is already in the model, given that one might have assumed cumulative
confirmed cases rate would capture all the variance associated with prevalence of COVID-19. However, it
is possible that this is only a rough measure of prevalence (due to asymptomatic cases, underreporting,
false test results etc.), and that population density and average household size are therefore capturing
unmeasured transmission of the virus. Another possibility is that these variables are capturing unmeasured
aspects of socio-economic disadvantage, or factors such as air pollution (Ogen, 2020; Bianconi et al., 2020;
Travaglio et al., 2020). The finding that % black or Asian reaches significance is consistent with evidence
from other studies (ONS, 2020c; OpenSAFELY Collaborative, 2020; Cook et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; PHE,
2020). The association may be explained by some combination of: unmeasured socio-economic
disadvantage; behavioural differences; greater prevalence of pre-existing conditions; and vitamin D
deficiency. In fact, the latter hypothesis seems particular promising (Ridley, 2020; Carl, 2020; Lanham-New
et al., 2020; Haroon et al., 2020; Brown, 2020).
Column (2) shows estimates from a model containing all the predictor variables. % multigenerational households has a negative coefficient, while the health index does not reach statistical
significance. Column (3) shows estimates from a model that excludes average household size but includes

7

% multi-generational households. The latter variable does not reach statistical significance, whereas %
black or Asian remains highly significant. Column (4) shows estimates from a model that includes the health
index but not the deprivation index. And column (5) shows estimates from a model that includes both the
health index and the deprivation index. The former variable has a negative coefficient, whereas the latter
has a highly significant positive coefficient.
2.3. Analysis using logged variables
This section reports the analysis using logged variables. A correlation matrix is given in Table 3. The
correlations of the predictor variables with log COVID-19 mortality rate are shown in the first column. Log
cumulative confirmed cases rate has the strongest association, followed by log % black or Asian. The
deprivation index has a weak positive association with log COVID-19 mortality rate, while the health index
has a weak negative association with log COVID-19 mortality rate. Average household size, log % multigenerational households and log population density have moderate-to-strong, positive associations with
log COVID-19 mortality rate. Scatterplots of the relationships between predictor variables and log COVID19 mortality rate are given in Figure 3.

Notes: The y-axis variable is the log of age-standardised COVID-19 mortality rate.

Estimates from multiple linear regression models of log COVID-19 mortality rate are given in Table 4.
Column (1) shows estimates from the preferred model. Four predictor variables explain 72% of the
variance in COVID-19 mortality across local authorities: log cumulative confirmed cases rate; log % black
or Asian; average household size; and deprivation index. Column (2) shows estimates from a model
containing all the predictor variables. % multi-generational households has a negative coefficient, while
neither log population density nor the health index reaches statistical significance. It is noteworthy that log
population density does not reach statistical significance in the model of log COVID-19 mortality rate, given
that population density was highly significant in all the models of COVID-19 mortality rate (see Table 2).
This difference is probably attributable to the fact that confirmed cases rate is much more strongly
associated with COVI-19 mortality rate when using logged variables than when using untransformed
variables (compared Table 1 and Table 3).

3. Conclusion
This study analysed COVID-19 mortality at the local authority level in England. Two separate analyses were
undertaken: one using untransformed variables, and one using logged variables. In the former, five
variables explained 73% of the variance in COVID-19 mortality rate: cumulative confirmed cases rate,
population density, % black or Asian, average household size, and a deprivation index. In the latter, four
variables explained 72% of the variance in log COVID-19 mortality rate: log cumulative confirmed cases
rate, log % black or Asian, average household size, and the deprivation index. Cumulative confirmed cases
rate, average household size and % black or Asian were the strongest and most consistent predictors of
COVID-19 mortality. None of the associations in this study should be considered causal, given that they
were derived from ecological analyses of observational data. (Code is provided on the OSF page. All data
are publicly available.)
