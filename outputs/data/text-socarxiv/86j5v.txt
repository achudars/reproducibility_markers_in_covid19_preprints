Infodemics:
Do healthcare professionals detect corona-related false news stories better than students?

Abstract
False news stories cause welfare losses and fatal health consequences. To limit its dissemination, it is
essential to know what determines the ability to distinguish between true and false news stories. In our
experimental study, we present subjects corona-related stories taken from the media from various categories
(e.g. social isolation, economic consequences, direct health consequences, and strong exaggeration). The
subject’s task is to evaluate the stories as true or false. Besides students with and without healthcare
background, we recruit healthcare professionals to increase the external validity of our study. Our main
findings are: (i) Healthcare professionals perform similar to students in correctly distinguishing between
true and false news stories. (ii) The propensity to engage in analytical thinking and actively open-minded
thinking is positively associated with the ability to distinguish between true and false. (iii) We find that the
residence of the subjects (East- or West-Germany) plays only a minor role. (iv) If news stories are in line
with existing narratives, subjects tend to think that the stories are true.

Introduction

The corona crisis has provided us with many examples of what Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, DirectorGeneral of the World Health Organization (2020), calls an “infodemic.”1 For example, it has been suggested
to cure Covid-19 with the help of smoking, cocaine, or even cow urine. Hundreds of Iranians died from
drinking methanol to cure Covid-19 and many others suffered from serious health implications.2 There are
also adventurous explanations for its roots, including bioweapon or the 5G wireless technology (Caulfield
2020). Moreover, conspiracy theories and false claims went viral when, for example, about 20,000 people
were demonstrating in Berlin (Germany) in June 2020 against the corona measures of chancellor Merkel.3
In social networks, some people (mostly supporters of right-wing parties) shared postings that a lot of more
people would have joined the demonstration. These unedited news stories are dangerous in that they give
the impression that a lot of more people are against these measures. As a consequence of the rise of coronarelated false news stories, various state governments and institutions have taken action. For example, the
German Federal Ministry of Health released a warning against covid-19-related false news stories.4 Twitter

removed a tweet of President Donald Trump in which he retweeted a way to supposedly cure from Covid19, when in fact no such way existed.5 In several countries, laws against the spread of false news have been
passed. In Hungary, for example, people can be sentenced up to 5 years if they violate the law, which,
however, creates an atmosphere of uncertainty among journalists.6
What’s the problem with false news stories in general? Lazer et al. (2018) argue “We define “fake news”
to be fabricated information that mimics news media content in form but not in organizational process or
intent. Fake-news outlets, in turn, lack the news media’s editorial norms and processes for ensuring the
accuracy and credibility of information.” We are in line with this definition but prefer to speak of false news
stories throughout this paper. The reason is that the term fake news has not only been used to describe false
information but also derogatory for information that does not reflect one’s own (e.g. of a politician) opinion
(Grüner 2020a). Besides terminology, a key problem of false news stories is that they restrict the
functioning of markets as well as democratic, political decision processes. They prevent competition of
ideas what, in turn, can lead to societal misallocations, for example, by influencing public opinion and
voting (Waldman 2018). Moreover, trust in media and institutions in general can be eroded. Even worse,
false news stories are spreading fast. For example, Vosoughi et al. (2018) found in their Twitter study that
false news spread faster than true news since the former are mostly topical and cause emotional reactions.
That makes it hard to correct them, in particular when a huge amount of false news information is generated
as it is the case in the corona pandemic (van Bavel et al. 2020).
Since its outbreak, there has been a huge amount of information on Covid-19 every day (Fleming 2020).
Many news items were correct, but there were also a large number of false news stories. Thus, there is no
surprise that Donovan (2020) calls in a Nature article that “Social-media companies must flatten the curve
of misinformation.” To avoid welfare losses in general and adverse health consequences due to false claims
in particular, it is socially desirable that people are able to distinguish between true and false news
information. But who is good at this exercise? The objective of this paper is to identify determinants that
help to distinguish between true and false news stories. Knowledge about such determinants can help to
reduce the dissemination of false news stories.
This question is not new. For example, Pennycook and Rand (2019, 2020) have tackled it before. However,
our study differs from former studies in the design and context of the news stories. While other studies
mostly present headlines of a news story, we show experimental subjects also a couple of sentences or a
short paragraph. Instead of analyzing political news stories (e.g. Presidential Election Campaign;
Pennycook and Rand 2019, 2020), we address corona-related news stories. Furthermore, many
experimental studies deal with students only (cf., Croson 2006; Druckman and Kam 2011; Fréchette 2015).
Students are easy to recruit because of their low opportunity costs. However, the external validity of a study
can be questioned if only students are considered since they are a rather untypical population with regard
to age, income, and education. We do not restrict ourselves with the population of students but also recruit
healthcare professionals to increase the external validity of our study. It seems to be an interesting question
to ask whether the expertise and experience of healthcare professionals help to more adequately process
corona-related news information.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we describe our behavioral research questions.
After presenting the methods (experimental design, approach to data analysis, recruitment procedure) in
Section 3, we describe our results in Section 4. Section 5 concludes.

Behavioral research question

As indicated above, this paper aims at analyzing the ability to distinguish between true and false coronarelated news stories. We tackle the following research questions:
i.

Are students who are enrolled in medicine or healthcare perform better in identifying false news
stories than other students? Do healthcare professionals (e.g. physicians) perform best in
differentiating between true and false news stories?

According to Pennycook et al. (2020), COVID-19 is a scientific issue. We expect that students of medicine
and the health care sciences are more capable of processing and classifying information on corona due to
their theoretical knowledge than students of other degree programs. Thus, the former should be better in
distinguishing between true and false news stories. We assume that healthcare professionals (e.g.
physicians) are best at differentiating between true and false news stories by virtue of their theoretical
knowledge and practical experience.
ii.

Are the propensity to engage in analytical reasoning (=cognitive sophistication) and actively openminded thinking (AOT) positively correlated with the ability to correctly distinguish between true
and false news?

Pennycook and Rand (2019, 2020) find that the propensity to engage in analytical reasoning helps to
differentiate between true and false news stories. In line with that, analyzing data from Canada, the U.K.,
and the U.S.A., Pennycook et al. (2020) find a negative association between cognitive sophistication and
misperceptions about COVID-19. Another safeguard against false news stories is actively open-minded
thinking: experimental evidence has shown that there is a positive correlation between the AOT score and
the ability to differentiate between true and false news stories (Bronstein et al. 2019).
iii.

Does the familiarity with the stories (i.e., subjects report that they have seen the story before)
increase the probability that people think that the story is true?

In their experimental study, Pennycook et al. (2018) show that even a single exposure increases the
perceived accuracy of false news stories. The repetition of a news story promotes familiarity and higher
familiarity increases, in turn, the probability that it is perceived as true (Cook and Lewandowsky 2012).
This is also known as the illusory truth effect. Moreover, experimental results in the field of environmental
economics provides evidence that even the perception of having seen a news story before, increases the
likelihood that the story is considered to be true (Grüner 2020b). As a consequence, false news stories are
more likely to be accepted as true. We investigate this relationship in the context of COVID-19.
iv.

Are there differences between the eastern and western population of Germany in the perception of
news stories?

Before reunification, Germany experienced two distinct economic systems: capitalism in West Germany
and socialism in East Germany. The different socialization could lead individuals to perceiving information
differently and reacting in a different manner on political measures (e.g. lockdown). Different socialization
and experiences of corona may have led to different emotions and evaluation of media content. However,
it remains unclear whether this affects the ability to differentiate between true and false news.

4

v.

How do anxiety and personal experiences influence the ability to distinguish between true and false
news stories?

Confirmation bias assumes that individuals are more likely to believe information that is consistent with
their own views (e.g. Lord et al. 1979). Similarly, people who are afraid of corona could be more likely to
believe news stories that stress the negative consequences of corona. Similarly, personal experiences and
involvement may be relevant: the more affected an individual is, the more likely he or she is to uncritically
accept news items that address strong negative consequences. However, it remains an open question
whether fears or personal experiences are important determinants to explain the ability to distinguish
between true and false news stories.

Methods7
Experimental Design

The study consists of two parts: In the first part, experimental subjects are shown 8 stories taken from the
news media. Note that the study was launched in May 2020 and the news stories, therefore, reflect the early
stages of the corona pandemic. In the second part, we collect data on a variety of socio-demographic
variables, attitudes, and personality traits.
A. News stories
We present each experimental subject with 8 corona-related stories taken from the media (cf., Table 1 for
a short description of the stories; the sources of the stories can found in Table A1 of the Appendix). They
were presented a headline and a couple of sentences (e.g. a small paragraph) of a news article.8 The overall
topics of the stories can be roughly divided into 4 categories: Social isolation (stories 1 & 2), economic
consequences (stories 3 & 4), direct health consequences (stories 5 & 6), and strong exaggeration (stories
7 & 8). For each story, we have a true and a false version. We refer to a story as true if we did adopt the
story from the media without manipulating its content. The false news stories contain any kind of false
news information. After presenting the subjects a story (either true or false), we asked them whether they
believe that the story is accurate (i.e., does not contain any kind of false news information). We randomly
assign subjects either to the correct or false version of a story. Randomization allows us to interpret the
results in terms of causality and not only correlation. Moreover, we attached three further questions to each
story: (i) how confident are subjects in their assessment, (ii) have the subjects seen the news story before,
and (iii) has the news story surprised the subjects when they read it. Overall, we randomized the order of
the news stories to mitigate possible order and anchoring effects. For example, the news stories could cause
emotions to an unknown extent, which might affect the response behavior to other stories.
What do the manipulations of the stories (i.e., false news stories) look like? With the exception of the
category strong exaggeration, we have changed the sign of the core statement of each story. For example,
7

This study has been approved by the German Association for Experimental Economic Research e.V. (No. 8ScdfpyT). The
participants were informed about the background of the study (problem of false news stories in the health-care sector) and what
had to be done in the study (to evaluate news stories, answer questions about experiences and opinions, etc.). They were also
told that participation is voluntary and that data processing is anonymous and confidential. The study is in line with the General
Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679. To participate, individuals had to confirm (by actively checking the respective boxes
in the web-based study) that they are at least 18 years old and accept the conditions of participation. Moreover, the study has
been pre-registered before any data have been collected (AsPredicted #40327).
8
By not only showing a headline but also a couple of sentences, we provide the subjects background information. For example,
Germans who are not living in Saxony-Anhalt may never have heard about Haseloff. Thus, subjects can read some details about
a topic if they want. In reality, people can also look for additional information, for example, by using a search engine. However,
we cannot say if there are differences at all between our design and only providing headlines. This is left open for further research.

the correct version of story 1 is about Saxony-Anhalt’s Prime Minister Reiner Haseloff who has argued that
East Germans are better prepared for the corona crisis. The key message of the false story is reversed in the
sense that the politician said that that East Germans are less well prepared for the corona crisis. Let us take
a look at another example, for illustration purposes. The fifth story, which deals with direct health
consequences due to corona, is about gender. The correct version argues that men are more vulnerable to
the new coronavirus. The false version, where we completely change the central message, claims that
women are more vulnerable to the new coronavirus. The stories that we label as strong exaggeration are
made much more extreme in the false version. For example, story 8 is about the transmission of corona via
farts. In its correct version, it is only said that an Australian medical doctor has made some statements on
this. In the false version, it is claimed that the Texas vice-governor initiated a general pants duty and that
there is some Twitter activity (e.g. #Pants duty).

Clinics in the corona crisis: overtime work

Many beds are currently empty in numerous clinics in
Germany. This is because plannable operations are
postponed or cancelled. As a result, the Schön-Klinik, for
example, sent employees at several locations on short-time
working, including physicians and nursing staff.

Norman Swan, an Australian doctor and podcaster, says in a
new episode of “Coronacast,” a coronavirus podcast of the
Australian channel ABC. Texas vice-governor Dan
Patrick promptly announced a decree of a general pants
duty. The stipulated minimum leg length should be 20
inches (approx. 51 cm). By wearing pants and
underpants, the effect is similar to that of an everyday
mask. The population in Germany is also reacting to this
threat. On Twitter there are not only contributions
under #Mask duty but also under #Pants duty.

B. Further variables
Propensity to engage in analytical reasoning. Frederick (2005) introduced a cognitive reflection test (CRT)
to measure whether people can be described as intuitive or reflective thinkers. The test consists of a bunch
of questions which have an intuitive but wrong answer. The correct answer can be found out at a second
look (i.e., after rechecking the result). This test is often used to elicit the propensity to engage in analytical
reasoning: a high score in this test is associated with analytical thinking, whereas a low score is related to
intuitive thinking. We slightly changed the wording of the original items of Frederick’s test. For example,
we asked: “A safety mask and a disinfectant product cost together €11.10. The protective mask costs €10
more than the disinfectant. How much does the disinfectant cost?” The correct answer reads €0.55 (an
intuitive but false answer amounts to €1.10). Actively open-minded thinking (AOT). AOT measures whether
actively open-minded thinking is perceived as good. We adopt the 7-item scale from Haran et al.
(2013:201). For example, one of their items is: “People should take into consideration evidence that goes
against their beliefs.” Beyond CRT and AOT, we collected socio-demographic variables (e.g. age,
education, gender, residence) and variables about fears and anxiety. The latter does not only include worries
about immediate adverse health consequences, social isolation, and economic consequences but also
individual actions as a consequence to corona (basic food reserves, hygiene products, and homeopathy).
We also captured data on consumption of information and related attitudes (e.g. trust in media, change of
trust in media, trust in government).
C. Financial incentives

data, the participants were asked to send us an informal e-mail if they would like to participate in the raffle.

Statistical methods used for data analysis

Our variable of interest is whether subjects correctly identify news stories taken from the media. Correct
identification means that correct news stories are identified as correct and false news stories are identified
as wrong.
I.

Overall correct identification

On the aggregate level, we sum up how often the stories are correctly identified by the subjects. Since we
examine a total of 8 news stories, the dependent variable can take values from 0 to 8. This allows us to run
a simple OLS regression.9 The regression contains Population (i.e., whether subjects identified themselves
as healthcare professionals, healthcare students, non-healthcare students or something else). The category
(i.e., vector) Thinking captures both CRT and AOT. Familiarity measures whether subjects have seen the
stories before (i.e., it is aggregated over all stories), whether the stories are surprising and whether subjects
are certain in their answering behaviors. The dummy East covers the residence of the subjects (East
Germany or West Germany). Anxiety&Involvement is about the worries of the subjects (e.g. social isolation,
immediate health consequences, consequences for the economy; reactions: food reserves or more
disinfection; risk factors, such as smoking behavior, age). The other variables in the regression are for
exploratory purposes/serve as controls. Education measures the highest formal degree of the subjects.
Gender captures the gender the subjects identify with. Information measures the activities and perception
of news and how they are communicated (e.g. trust in media, media consumption). Week is the dummy to
control for time when the subjects joined the study and Time measures the amount of minutes the subjects
took to finish the study.

Recruitment strategy

We planned to recruit healthcare professionals, healthcare students, and non-healthcare students. The
starting point to recruit students was a list of universities in Germany from Wikipedia.10 From this list, we

selected the largest universities (in terms of the number of students) and contacted the deans/deans of
studies with the request to advertise the study. In addition, we directly contacted several professors from
different departments and student councils. We put emphasis on covering subjects from different regions
in Germany to obtain meaningful results (e.g. not only subjects from the south of Germany). In order to
recruit healthcare professionals, we used the publicly available physician lists of the Association of
Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (KV) of various federal states of Germany. Furthermore, subjects
from various university hospitals were considered as long as contact details are publicly available.

Description of the subjects

During the period from 18.5.2020-2.8.2020, we recruited a total of 2,077 experimental subjects. The vast
majority of our subjects are university students (N=1,457). Among them, there are 208 healthcare students.
We recruited 367 professionals from the non-healthcare sector. Our sample contains 213 healthcare
professionals (of which 128 subjects associated themselves as a physician). The description of the subjects
is depicted in Table 2.12 In the following, we do not attempt to describe the variables in detail, but rather to
communicate a broad sense of the data set. This is sufficient (but also necessary) to better understand the
(regression) results which we describe later. To our surprise, a considerable number of people whom we
approached with the request to advertise for the study attended themselves. Therefore, the level of education
of the non-healthcare professionals is relatively high. This is important since non-healthcare professionals
are a significant part of our control group in the population analysis. There are several differences between
professionals and students. It is no surprise that professionals are on average older than students. However,
there are interesting differences (in the willingness to attend the study) in gender. While slightly less than
50% of the professionals identified themselves as women, there was a surplus of women among the
students. This surplus was particularly evident among the healthcare students. Moreover, we consider
subjects who identified themselves with the third gender. However, its sample size is only low and, thus,
any results are preliminary.

11

Before analyzing the data, we carried out some plausibility checks. As a result, we dropped a total of three subjects. Two of
them were fast straightliners who took less than 5 minutes to finish the study. The third subject gave implausible answers (e.g.
age = 99).

Analysis of the decision behavior

4.2.1

First view on the decision behavior

Overall, the healthcare professionals performed slightly better than the students in distinguishing between
true and false news story (Table 3). Non-healthcare professionals performed best but the gap the other
populations is quite small. Within the stories, the performance of the subpopulations is similar to each other.
Story three is outstanding in spite of the worse performance of all subpopulations. A first educated guess is
that there is a gap between the viral narrative (that there are shortages of medical goods and commodities,
such as toilet paper and disinfect, which has been reported by the media) and the key message of the story
(reliance on foreign countries in spite of medical goods cannot be empirically proven).
We want to mention another point that is related to the performance of healthcare professionals in the stories
5 and 6, i.e., the stories that address direct health implications due to Covid-19 and in which we could have
expected the medical professionals to perform much better than the other ones. However, the healthcare
professionals performed quite similar as the other subpopulations (or only slightly better). One reason for
this might be that they “speak another language.” In other words, they might have perceived everyday
articles from the media as incorrect due to the chosen words of the author of the news story.

Regression analysis
Overall correct identification

The regression results are depicted in Table 4. Panel Ia is our main specification, which we want to describe
in detail. The other two estimations serve as a robustness check. Healthcare professionals (β=-0.2635, pvalue=0.019) seem to perform less well than students with (β=0.0339, p-value=0.800) and without
(β=0.0127, p-value=0.906) healthcare background. Its sign is negative, whereas the student variables are
slightly but positively associated with the overall correct identification of corona-related news stories. CRT
and AOT are positively related with the ability to correctly distinguish between true and false. The
magnitude of CRT (β=0.0886, p-value=0.003) seems to be more pronounced than AOT (β=0.0686, pvalue=0.124). The association of Familiarity with the stories and correct identification is positive, but very
small (β=0.0177, p-value=0.514). The same pattern can be observed for the variable Surprising (β=0.0136,
p-value=0.425). A somewhat larger effect results from Certainty (β=0.0381, p-value=0.040). Overall,
subjects from East Germany do not seem to differ much from the other subjects. Its sign is positive, but the
effect size is quite small in magnitude (β=0.0467, p-value=0.461). The associations between the variables
Quality health system to Smoker of the regression output (which capture the subjects’ anxiety and personal
experiences) and the ability to distinguish between true and false show no clear pattern. They all have in
common that the effect size is relatively low, but the sign of the respective variables varies seemingly at
random. Interestingly, Age is positively related to our variable of interest (β=0.0405, p-value=0.019).
However, if people get older the effect declines (β=-0.0449, p-value=0.027). The other variables are
addressed exploratory. We only refer to these variables if they seem to have a large contribution to the
distinction between true and false. Our focus is on education and time spent to finish the study. Education
seems to have a considerable explanatory power for our research interest. The coefficient is positive and its
magnitude is large (β=0.1042, p-value=0.005). The more time the subjects took to finish the study (i.e.,
Duration participation) the better they were in distinguishing between true and false (β=0.0217, pvalue=0.012). But as subjects took more time the effect diminishes (β=-0.0218, p-value=0.072).
A robustness check revealed interesting insights: If we refrain from controlling for Education and Age,
there are changes in the variables Population and AOT (the other variables remain the same). Most notably,
the seemingly worse performance of the Healthcare professionals (compared to students with and without
healthcare background) vanishes. In contrast, they even perform slightly better. Moreover, the magnitude
of AOT increases. Considering panel IIa, the drivers of the effects seem to be mainly Education in the case
of AOT, and Age in the case of the Healthcare professionals and students.
In the following story-by-story analysis, we check our regressions if there is a change if we do not control
for age or/and education. If so, then we will report it. Otherwise we stick to our main regression.
II.

Story-by-story correct identification

In this section, we want to present insights that are related to the individual stories. We focus on some
highlights for each story only (Tables 5 and 6).
Story 1. The key driver to explain the ability to distinguish between true and false news is Familiarity
(β=0.1875, p-value=0.000). The East-Dummy is positive, i.e., subjects from East Germany performed
better in this story (β=0.0699, p-value=0.005). This is in line with a confirmation bias: people from each of
both regions might have thought that they are better prepared for the corona crisis. But only in the case of
East-Germany this answering behavior is associated with a correct answer (because Haseloff has actually
said that the East is better prepared).

15

Story 2. Male perform slightly worse than women in distinguishing between true and false (β=-0.0355, pvalue=0.016). Possible explanations might include own experiences, empathy, and, in case of the students,
training in their respective degree programs. Moreover, is interesting that Certainty increases the
probability to perform well (β=0.0256, p-value=0.000).
Story 3. In this story, Familiarity (β=-0.1841, p-value=0.000) and (to a less extent) Certainty (β=-0.0331,
p-value=0.000) are drivers of the decision behavior of the subjects. Both signs are negative and the
magnitude of the variables seem to be important. Probably the subjects have heard about news stories in
this realm. We guess that the pervasive narrative (i.e., there is a shortage of medical goods and commodities
as well as a considerable reliance on foreign countries) contradicts the finding of the correct version of the
news story. This is in line with a confirmation bias.
Story 4. Familiarity is a strong predictor in this story (β=0.2678, p-value=0.000). If people believe that they
know the story they do perform better. Immunosuppression is positively related to the variable of interest
(β=0.0750, p-value=0.042). The effect size is large. This is interesting because one might have expected
that this group of people fears a lack of capacities of hospitals most. Maybe the unexpected finding can be
explained by the experience of regular visits to physicians and hospitals.
Story 5. In this story, Familiarity is a strong predictor in this story (β=0.2337, p-value=0.000). Compared
to women, subjects who identified themselves as Diverse performed less well in distinguishing between
true and false (β=-0.2155, p-value=0.019). This result is at best preliminary since the sample size is small.
Story 6. As expected, Reaction homeopathy is negatively (but only slightly) associated with our variable of
interest (β=-0.0155, p-value=0.016). This is in line with a confirmation bias: The correction version of this
story was that homeopathic remedies themselves have no effect. People who have stronger used
homeopathic stuff probably did not exclude that there is a positive effect. The effect of Reaction disinfection
(β=-0.0138, p-value=0.015) is similar to Reaction homeopathy.
Story 7. Small, positive effects can be observed in the variables Surprising (β=0.0464, p-value=0.086) and
(to a less extent) Certainty (β=0.0171, p-value=0.000). The variable Trustmedia (β=0.0305, p-value=0.024)
has a considerable positive effect. Compared to women, subjects who identified themselves as Diverse
performed less well in distinguishing between true and false (β=-0.1940, p-value=0.041).
Story 8. CRT (β=0.0392, p-value=0.000) and AOT (β=0.0418, p-value=0.007) prevent of falling for this
kind of strong exaggeration.

Conclusions and Discussion

Infodemics – the spread of false news claims – constitutes a great societal challenge during the corona
crisis. This paper addressed the question of who is good at distinguishing between true and false news
stories in the realm of corona. For this purpose, we recruited not only students but also healthcare
professionals. The main findings of the study can be summarized as follows: We find that healthcare
professionals, non-healthcare professionals, and students both with and without healthcare background
perform similar in distinguishing between true and false news story. Moreover, we find that the residence
of the subjects (East- or West-Germany) plays only a minor role. Furthermore, we found evidence that the
propensity to engage in analytical thinking (CRT) and actively open-minded thinking (AOT) are positively
associated with the ability to correctly distinguish between true and false news stories. When this study was
carried out, there was a shortage commodities (most notably, the pictures where toilet paper and disinfect
was out of sale went viral in the German media). Probably as a consequence of having this picture in mind,

16

people incorrectly thought that Germany’s medical care heavily depends on foreign countries. If news
stories are in line with existing narratives, subjects tend to think that the stories are true.
With regard to CRT and AOT, our results are in line with Pennycook and Rand (2019, 2020). They also
found that these two determinants help to distinguish between true and false news stories. Our finding that
narratives seem to matter is related to the literature of the confirmation bias (Lord et al. 1979). Confirmation
bias is about prior beliefs which influence if individuals agree to something or not. Narratives are stories
that go viral at a specific time. They may influence the beliefs of individuals. To the best of our knowledge,
the other two findings have not been systematically studied before. Overall, the residence of the subjects
(East- or West-Germany) does not seem to matter much for our topic. Maybe about 30 years after
reunification, the different socialization is not an important point when it comes to distinguishing between
true and false news stories. To our surprise, healthcare professionals did not perform better than nonhealthcare professionals or students even if the news stories were linked to immediate health implications.
Maybe healthcare professionals speak in another language than other people, and perceive everyday articles
from the media as incorrect due to the wording of the author who tries to reach a broad audience.
Our study shows that individuals are vulnerable to false news information, regardless of their level of
education and expertise. In this realm, narratives seem to matter: communication of the mass media
influences people’s perception of the state of the world. We identified AOT and CRT as protective factors:
teaching activities in this area might help to better distinguish between true and false news stories and, in
turn, help to reduce the spread of false news stories. However, our study suffers from some limitations. For
example, we deal with a non-representative convenience sample with mostly high-educated individuals –
further research should address the general population. Furthermore, the role of narratives should further
be investigated. For example, it is important to find out how narratives and the perception of news stories
(either true or false) are correlated with each other. Moreover, it would add value to the literature to find
out under which circumstances people think about news stories, accept it uncritically or even ignore it.
