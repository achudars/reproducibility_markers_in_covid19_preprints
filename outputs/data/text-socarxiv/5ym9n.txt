Revenge of the Experts:
Will COVID-19 Renew or Diminish Public Trust in
Science?
By Cevat G. Aksoy, Barry Eichengreen and Orkun Saka⇤
An e↵ect of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is sometimes suggested,
will be to reverse the secular trend toward questioning the value of
scientific research and expertise. We analyze this hypothesis by examining how exposure to previous epidemics a↵ected the confidence
of individuals in science and scientists. Consistent with theory and
evidence that attitudes are durably formed when individuals are in
their impressionable years between the ages of 18 and 25, we focus on people who were exposed to epidemics in their country of
residence at this stage of the life course. Combining data from a
2018 Wellcome Trust survey of more than 70,000 individuals in
160 countries with data on global epidemics since 1970, we show
that such exposure has no impact on views of science as an endeavor or on opinions of whether the study of disease is properly
an aspect of science, but that it significantly reduces confidence in
scientists and the benefits of their work. These findings are robust
to a variety of controls, empirical methods and sensitivity checks.
We suggest some implications for how scientific findings are communicated and for how scientists seeking to inform and influence
public opinion should position themselves in the public sphere.
One e↵ect of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been suggested, will be to reverse
the secular trend of challenging the value of scientific expertise. “The coronavirus
crisis has put a spotlight on the importance of science in supporting our nation’s
well being,” as one such statement has put it (Shepherd, 2020). At the same
time, the pandemic has put on display certain leaders’ “longstanding practice of
undermining scientific expertise for political purposes” (Friedman and Plumer,
2020), plausibly with negative implications for how members of the public view
science and scientists. All of which points to the question posed by Grove (2020),
“Will the coronavirus renew public trust in science?”
One can distinguish several further questions under this heading. First, is there
a particular tendency to challenge scientific expertise in settings such as that of

an epidemic when scientific advice appears to conflict, superficially at least, with
economic self-interest (when for example infectious disease specialists recommend
lockdowns that threaten the economic livelihood of individuals)? Earlier research
is suggestive of this possibility. Longhurst (2010) describes a decision of the North
Atlantic Fisheries Organization to reopen the fishery for several cod populations
after earlier moratoria, “a decision that responded not to favorable scientific assessments, but rather to the fact that the period of income support for Atlantic
fishermen had terminated and small coastal communities faced great difficulties.
In this, and in similar cases of decisions that were made contrary to scientific opinion, the administrative strategy appears to have been either to denigrate science
or to make it invisible.”
Second, there is the question of whether any change in public opinion will
mainly regard the scientific endeavor or individual scientists. Does any positive
or negative reassessment of the importance and validity of science apply to both
the undertaking and those engaged in it? Or does the public continue to have
confidence in science as a potential source of a vaccine while dismissing individual
scientists who warn that the time needed to develop that vaccine may be lengthy?
How scientists might best alter how they communicate to maintain or regain
public confidence could be very di↵erent depending on answers to these questions.
In contrast to the large literature on the role of trust in citizens’ compliance
with public health directives and preventive or curative interventions (Mohseni
and Lindstrom, 2007; Vinck et al., 2019), no previous study has investigated the
impact of epidemics on trust in science and scientists. In this paper, we analyze
this issue using the 2018 Wellcome Global Monitor, which includes responses
to questions about confidence in science and scientists from more than 70,000
individuals in 160 countries.
We use data on all global epidemics since 1970 to identify respondents who
experienced an epidemic outbreak in their country of residence during their formative years, the stage of the life course when value systems and opinions are
durably formed. Krosnick and Alwin (1989) formalize this as the “impressionable
years hypothesis,” that core attitudes, beliefs, and values crystallize between the
ages of 18 and 25. Spear (2000) links this to the literature in neurology describing neurochemical and anatomical di↵erences between the adolescent and adult
brain. This hypothesis has been productively applied in other contexts. Giuliano
and Spilimbergo (2014) show, for example, that experiencing a recession between
the ages of 18 and 25 has a powerful impact on political preferences and beliefs
about the economy that persists over the life cycle.
We find that although formative-year epidemic exposure does not influence
respondents’ views of the value of science as an undertaking or endeavor, it is
negatively and significantly associated with opinions of the integrity and trustworthiness of individual scientists. Strikingly, there is no similar association in
the case of public health professionals; the exposure e↵ect is specific to scientists,
as opposed to doctors, nurses, traditional healers, and others responding to the

3

public-health consequences of an epidemic. There is no such association for individuals who experienced an epidemic outbreak in their country before or after
their formative years.
Our analysis is related to several literatures. There is the literature on communicating science in social settings, which shows how di↵erences in findings across
studies may be seen by the public as discrediting the investigators, depending
on how they are presented (Scheufele, 2013; Van Der Bles et al., 2020). These
analyses point to the importance of scientists displaying trustworthiness as well
as expertise when communicating findings and o↵ering public-policy recommendations (Fiske and Dupree, 2014). There is the literature concerned with science
and public opinion (Drummond and Fischho↵, 2017), in which it is argued, inter
alia, that scientific knowledge may be invoked or dismissed insofar as it supports
or challenges non-scientific (economic or political) concerns. Finally, there is the
literature on how early life experience shapes the reception by individuals of scientific communication (Fischho↵, 2013). But where that literature emphasizes
the role played by science classes and informal childhood science education, our
analysis points also to other early life experience, such as exposure to a public
health emergency.
Our results do not yield specific prescriptions for how epidemiologists, infectious
disease specialists and other scientists should alter how they communicate their
results and provide policy guidance. But they are suggestive. They point to
a potential problem in the case of COVID-19. They locate that problem as
pertaining scientists as individuals rather than science as an endeavor and as
emanating from individuals currently in their formative years.

Data

Wellcome Global Monitor (WGM)

WGM is a nationally representative survey fielded in some 160 countries in
2018. It is the first global survey of how people think and feel about key health
and science challenges, including attitudes towards vaccines; trust in doctors,
nurses and scientists; trust in medical advice from the government; whether people
believe in the benefits of science. WGM also provides information on respondents’
demographic and labor market characteristics. The outcome variables of interest
come from questions asked of all WGM respondents regarding their confidence in
science and scientists:
1) “in general, would you say that you trust science a lot, some, not much, or
not at all”;
2) “how much do you trust scientists working in colleges/universities in this
country to do each of the following?
• to do their work with the intention of benefiting the public

4

REVENGE OF THE EXPERTS

• to be open and honest about who is paying for their work”
3) “thinking about companies - for example, those who make medicines or agricultural supplies - how much do you trust scientists working for companies
in this country to do each of the following?
• to do their work with the intention of benefiting the public

• to be open and honest about who is paying for their work”
Responses were coded on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from “A lot” (1) to
“Not at all” (4). We code “A lot” and “Some” as 1 and zero otherwise. The
geographical dispersion of responses to the most relevant survey questions are
shown in Figure 1.
WGM also provides information on respondents’ demographic characteristics
(age, gender, educational attainment, marital status, religion, and urban/rural
residence), labor market outcomes, and within-country income deciles. Controlling for employment status and income allows us to measure the impact of
past epidemics on confidence in science and scientists beyond the direct e↵ect
of epidemics on material well-being. We also examine responses to four parallel
questions as placebo outcomes, namely whether the respondents have confidence
in: doctors and nurses; hospitals and health clinics; NGO workers; traditional
healers. This helps us to determine whether what we are capturing is the impact
of epidemic exposure on scientists specifically, as distinct from any impact on
healthcare-related outcomes.
B.

International Disaster Database (EM-DAT)

Data on the worldwide epidemic occurrence and e↵ects are drawn from the
EM-DAT International Disasters Database from 1970 to the present. EM-DAT
was established in 1973 as a non-profit within the School of Public Health of the
Catholic University of Louvain; it subsequently became a collaborating center of
the World Health Organization. Its database is compiled from multiple sources
including UN agencies, non-governmental organizations, insurance companies, research institutes, and press agencies. It includes all epidemics (viral, bacterial,
parasitic, fungal, and prion) meeting one or more of the following criteria:
• 10 or more people dead;
• 100 or more people a↵ected;
• declaration of a state of emergency;
• a call for international assistance.
Each epidemic is identified with the country where it took place. When an epidemic a↵ects several countries, several separate entries are made to the database

5

for each. EM-DAT provides information on the start and end date of the epidemic, the number of deaths, and the number of individuals a↵ected. The number
of individuals a↵ected refers to the total number requiring immediate assistance
(assistance with basic survival needs such as food, water, shelter, sanitation, and
immediate medical treatment) during the period of emergency. We aggregate the
epidemic related information in this database at the county-year level and merge
it with WGM.
II.

Empirical Strategy

To assess the e↵ect of past exposure to an epidemic on an individual’s trust in
science and scientists, we estimate the following OLS specification:
Yi,c,a =

1 EpidemicExposure(18

25)i,c,a +

2 Xi + 3 Cc + 4 Aa + 5 Cc Age+"i,c,a

where Yi,c,a is a dummy variable indicating whether or not the respondent i
with age a in country c has confidence in science or scientists. To operationalize
EpidemicExposure(18-25), we calculate for each individual the number of people
a↵ected by an epidemic as a share of the population in their country, averaged
over the 8 years when the individual was in his or her formative years (18-25
years old), consistent with the “impressionable years hypothesis.” The coefficient
of interest is 1 , which captures the impact of past exposure to an epidemic on
the confidence in science or scientists.
To adjust for the e↵ect of demographic and labor market structure on the outcome variables, we control for observable individual characteristics. We specify
the Xi vector of individual characteristics to include: indicator variables for living
in an urban area and for having a child (any child under 15), and dummy variables
for gender (male), employment status (full-time employed, part-time employed,
unemployed), religion (religious vs. non-religious), educational attainment (tertiary education, secondary education), and within-country-year income quintiles.
To account for unobservable characteristics, we include fixed e↵ects separately at
the levels of country (Cc ) and age (Aa ). The country dummies control for all
variation in the outcome variable due to factors that vary cross-nationally. The
age dummies control for the variation in the outcome variable caused by factors
that are heterogeneous across (but homogenous within) age groups.
In addition to saturating our specification with country and age fixed-e↵ects, we
include country-specific age trends (Cc Age). These address the possibility that,
even though we control for overall age-related factors via the above-mentioned
fixed e↵ects, the interaction of age and attitudes may di↵er across countries. For
example, older or younger age groups may be more or less likely to support the
government in some countries but not others. Country-specific age trends will
tend to remove such variation to the extent that it exists. Finally, we cluster
standard errors by country and use sample weights provided by Gallup to make

6

the data representative at the country level. Finally, estimates using ordered logit
are virtually the same in terms of statistical and economic significance.
III.

Results

Table 1 reports our results for three dependent variables related to the societal impact of science: whether the respondent has confidence in science; thinks
that science will help to improve life; and thinks that studying disease is a part
of science. It shows that formative-year epidemic exposure has a positive but
small and statistically insignificant e↵ect in all three cases. Table 2, in contrast,
reports the results for dependent variables related to respondents’ views of scientists: whether the respondent has confidence in scientists; believes that scientists
working for private companies benefit the public; believes that scientists working
for private companies are honest; believes that scientists working for universities
benefit the public, and believes that scientists working for universities are honest. Here the coefficients on formative-year epidemic exposure are negative, not
positive as in Table 1. They di↵er significantly from zero at least at the 95 per
cent confidence level in all cases but whether scientists working for universities
benefit the public. The results presented in Column 1 of Table 2, for example,
show that an individual with the highest exposure to epidemics (0.032, that is,
the number of people a↵ected by an epidemic as a share of the population in individual’s formative years) relative to individuals with no exposure has on average
11 percentage points (-3.454*0.032) less confidence in the honesty of scientists.
Evidently, individuals who experience epidemics at first hand retain confidence
in the positive potential of science as an endeavor. They continue to believe in
the importance of disease-related scientific research. But they are less confident
about the trustworthiness and public-spiritedness of the individuals involved in
scientific endeavors. Checkland, Marshall and Harrison (2004) and Smith (2005),
also working in a public health context, distinguish between “confidence” as something that is entrusted in systems on the one hand and the “trust” that is invested
in individuals on the other. Our results point to the conclusion that epidemic
exposure reduces trust in scientists but not confidence in science. Impressionistically, this distinction is consistent with what we observe in, inter alia, the
United States, where politicians and commentators have questioned the value of
the public-policy recommendations o↵ered by individual scientists (viz. Senator
Rand Paul’s comment “As much as I respect you, Dr. Fauci, I don’t think you’re
the end-all”) while at the same time seeking to mobilize all available scientific
resources to develop a vaccine by the end of 2020 (the Trump Administration’s
“Operation Warp Speed”).
Given that previous work points to science education as shaping views of science and scientists, we also estimate our main specification for two subsamples:
respondents who learned about science at most at the primary school level, versus
respondents who learned about science at least at the secondary school level. The
results, in Table 3, reveal substantial di↵erences. They suggest that our results are

7

driven by the sample of individuals with little or no science education. Additional
analysis (not presented here) suggests that these results cannot be explained by
the possible interruption in education due to exposure to an epidemic.
We examined a number of placebo tests and sensitivity analyses to verify the
robustness of the results. The placebo tests address the possibility that what we
are picking up is not the impact on the perceived trustworthiness and publicspiritedness of scientists engaged in health-related research specifically but the
impact on perceptions of individuals engaged in tasks related to healthcare and
health outcomes more generally. In contrast to its significant negative impact on
confidence in scientists, the results in Table 4 indicate no significant impact on
confidence in doctors and nurses, in hospitals and health clinics, in NGO workers,
or in traditional healers.
We also confirmed the persistence of the impact of epidemic exposure as individuals age over time. In order to see this, we re-estimated our main specification for
di↵erent subsamples based on a rolling age window. Across these age windows,
treatment period (i.e., 18-25 years) is fixed; however individuals’ age changes,
meaning that as we test older subsamples, the gap between the treatment period and the outcome (trust in science or scientists) widens. Figure 2 confirms
that epidemic exposure between the ages of 18 and 25 continues to significantly
influence perceptions of the individuals towards scientists with no corresponding
e↵ect on science.
Lastly, findings in Table 5 suggest that the e↵ect is insignificant when individuals are exposed to epidemics in any period other than when they are between 18
and 25 years old. Together with the results reported in the preceding paragraph,
these findings are consistent with the formative-years hypothesis that there is
something special about the early-adult years that leaves a long-lasting legacy in
individuals’ beliefs and attitudes.
IV.

Conclusion

COVID-19 promises to reshape every aspect of society, not excluding how science is perceived. The precise nature of these changes remains to be seen. It
is not clear whether the authority of science and scientists will be enhanced or
diminished, or whether such changes will a↵ect mainly science as an endeavor or
scientists as individuals.
If past epidemics are a guide, however, the virus will not have an impact on the
regard in which science as an undertaking is held, but it will reduce confidence in
individual scientists, worsen perceptions of their honesty, and weaken the belief
that their activities benefit the public. The strongest impact is likely to be felt
by individuals in their “impressionable years” whose beliefs are in the process of
being durably formed.
Responding to these trends will not be straightforward. At a minimum, our
findings suggest that scientists working on public health matters and others concerned with scientific communication should think harder about how to com-

8

municate trustworthiness and honesty and, specifically, about how the generation
currently in their impressionable years (“Generation Z”) perceives such attributes.
