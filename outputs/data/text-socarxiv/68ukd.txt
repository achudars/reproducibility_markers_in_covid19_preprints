in COVID-19 themed brand communications.

Abstract. This study aims to analyze emotional appeals in brand advertisements themed in
COVID-19 during the immediate months after the World Health Organization declared the
coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic. The study focused on the frequencies of use of positive
and negative emotional appeals in ad contents, and on the concurrent combinations of those
appeals. Researchers conducted a content analysis among ads included in an online archive,
selected by industry professionals for their creative quality. The results reveal a preference
for positive emotions, as nurturance and affiliation show the highest frequency of use. These
appeals, along with sorrow, nostalgia and excitement, were preferred to be used
concurrently. Research findings are consistent with the literature, and lead to future
examination of emotional appeals in advertising under stressful and uncertain
circumstances.
Keywords: emotional appeals, advertising, COVID-19, communication.

Introduction
The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak started in December 2019 in the Chinese city of
Wuhan (Mejova & Kalimeri, 2020). Since then, worldwide health has been threatened as the
virus spread from one continent to another. This circumstance increases the levels of stress
that people encounter as they face health, economic and emotional risks, in concomitance
with the difficulty of anticipating events in the short term. Anxiety, depression and stress
related to COVID-19 have been reported (Cowan, 2020; Huang & Zhao, 2020; Fitzpatrick,
Harris & Drawve, 2020). In this scenario, emotions may run high and play an important role
in the configuration of consumer’s attitudes and judgments (Royo-Vela, 2005). According to
the law of apparent reality, the more vivid the content of an advertisement, the more intense
and real will be the emotions perceived by the consumer (Frijda, 1988). For instance, if
COVID-19 has generated emotions such as fear or sorrow, ad messages conveying these
affections may intensify the consumers’ emotional experience and further stress them
1

(Kemp, Kennett-Hensel & Kees, 2013; Poels & Dewitte, 2019; Royo-Vela, 2005). Ad
practitioners prefer to match the emotions identified in target users with those in the
communication content, expecting this will drive individuals’ engagement with the brand
(Mogaji, 2016). Yet, advertisers ought to be cautious when using emotions during difficult
circumstances, as messages can heighten a sense of anxiety and stress amongst their buyers
and other subjects (Nabi, 2003).
The academic literature encompasses studies about the use of emotions in
advertisements. However, the adoption of these resources in ads subjected on a
phenomenon of such magnitude is unprecedented. It applies to deepen the knowledge
concerning the use of emotional appeals during stressful circumstances such as the current
pandemic. This study aims to analyze these appeals in advertisements from around the
world themed in COVID-19 and produced during the immediate months after the World
Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic. It does so in the
following research questions:
RQ1: What were the frequencies of use of positive and negative emotional appeals
featured in COVID-19 themed advertisements during the first months of the
pandemic?
RQ2: What were the preferred combinations of emotional appeals used by
advertising agencies in the COVID-19 themed ad contents during the early period of
the pandemic?
RQ3: How did the frequencies of use of emotional appeals evolve during the initial
months of the pandemic?
Researchers carried out a quantitative content analysis, providing a comprehensive
study related to each of the research questions. In the years to come, emotions will gain
prominence in brand communications (Kotler, Kartajaya & Setiawan 2017). Parvathi and
Mariselvi (2017) predict the appearance of Web 4.0 in 2020-2030, which will relate to the
concept of Emotive Web, where individuals allow themselves to share their emotions more
openly through social networks (Almeida, 2017; Polanska, 2014). For example, the social
network Facebook introduced new emojis as a means for its users to express their emotional
states (e.g. love, anger or sadness) (Tian et al., 2017). As the resource to emotions will
proliferate in marketing contents in the short and medium term, it is convenient to continue
deepening the knowledge about its use.

Literature review
Appeals are intentional resources to engage with potential customers’ needs, wants, or
interests (Bathia, 2019). They are a means for motivating subjects’ propensity to purchase
the advertised goods or services, by driving interest to the product, building long-term
loyalty, and creating a sense of belonging to a brand community (Bathia, 2019; Pinto &
Yagnik, 2016). The academic literature addresses two types of advertising appeals: rational
and emotional (Kotler 2003; Pinto & Yagnik, 2016). Rational appeals are driven by
information processing on a conscious level, while emotional appeals are so by the
unconscious mind or the persons’ feelings (Bhatia, 2019). Rational appeals focus on the
individual’s functional needs and emphasize objective features of the product and the service
(Rochford, 2011; Zhang et al., 2014). These claims often focus on the product’s utilitarian
2

benefits, such as pointing to a goods’ superior quality, value, performance and reliability
(Johar & Sirgy, 1991). Emotional appeals try to raise either negative or positive emotions
that prompt consumers to ease brand recall and promote purchasing decisions (AlbersMiller & Stafford, 1999; Kotler & Armstrong, 1991; Marchegiani & Phau, 2013; Zhang et
al., 2014).
Using positive emotional appeals assumes that consumers are emotionally
stimulated, and so, marketers try to stimulate this variable to carry out their goals (Pinto &
Yagnik, 2016) (see Table 1). Marketing and ad executives seek to make the consumer feel
good about the product by linking positive emotions to it, resulting in increased brand
likeability and strengthened positive attitudes related to the brand (Hornik, Ofir &
Rachamim, 2017; Panda, Panda & Mishra, 2013). Bathia (2019) identified linguistic markers
and strategies in emotional ads and found that the positive emotional grounding is critical
for brand recognition, the development of a positive attitude towards the brand, and
customer loyalty. Lin (2011) conducted a study to find the impact of positive emotional
appeals used in advertising on attitudes and purchase intentions. He reported that emotional
appeals do influence individuals’ attitudes toward the ad. After examining positive emotional
appeals in tourism TV commercials, Li (2019) argued that adventure and excitement are the
most effective appeals to relate with consumers. Further authors found that positive appeals
can also enhance the consumer’s attention (Chang & Chang, 2014; Czarnecka & Mogaji, 2019;
Hornik, Ofir & Rachamim, 2017; Panda, Panda & Mishra, 2013; Wu et al., 2018).
Other studies compare positive and negative emotional appeals in ad contents. For
example, Coleman, Royne & Pounders (2020) focus on guilt and pride appeals in causerelated marketing messages. They found that pride appeals are more effective for promoting
cause-related actions in individuals, while guilt works in promoting actions and prevention
awareness. Czarnecka & Mogaji (2019) examined positive and negative emotional appeals
in advertisements for financial loans. Their results convey that these ads use positive
emotions such as relief, security or excitement, and that negative emotional appeals were
employed occasionally. In their review of the literature, Czarnecka & Mogaji (2019) identify
15 types of positive and negative emotional appeals used in advertising. Wu et al. (2018)
analyzed a sample of positive and negative emotional appeals in click intention on digital
advertisements. Their findings showed a powerful effect related to positive emotions, and a
weak one toward negative ones.

The presence of negative emotional appeals is smaller among advertising messages,
as research reveals that positive ones have a wider range of marketing benefits (Czarnecka
& Mogaji, 2019; Deborah & Nicole, 2009; Dens & De Pelsmacker, 2010; Zheng, 2020) (see
Table 2). The literature is divided about the effectiveness of negative emotional appeals,
some authors assert that they might produce negative associations with the brand (Berger
& Milkman, 2012; Evans, Adamo & Czarnecka, 2019), while others explain that negative
feelings can bring good advertising appraisal and attitudes towards the product (Brennan &
Binney, 2010; Coleman, Royne & Pounders, 2020; Coulter & Pinto, 1995; Grossman & Wood,
1993). Studies even suggest that sometimes messages featuring negative appeals are more
effective than those containing positive ones (Basil, Ridgeway & Basil, 2006; Giachino et al.,
2017; Kemp, Kennett-Hensel & Kees, 2013; Krishen & Bui, 2015; Wang, 2008). For example,
guiltiness can work for charities and nonprofits advertisements, as Kemp, Kennett-Hensel &
4

Kees (2013) remarked, that feelings of guilt promote the intention to donate. Consistent
research shows that guiltiness and sorrow are emotional appeals that stimulate a desire to
help others (Basil, Ridgeway & Basil, 2006; Wang, 2008). Another example relates to fear,
which has been reported to prompt the purchase of healthy products, as Krishen & Bui
(2015) note. They found that, after seeing pictures of obese bodies in advertisements,
participants increased their preference for these products after fear of obesity. Giachino et
al. (2017) suggested that fear was effective in reducing high-speed driving when used in
advertising targeted to drivers.
The studies claim that emotional appeals can backfire when consumers perceive
them as manipulative (Brennan & Binney, 2010; Coleman, Royne & Pounders, 2020; Coulter
& Pinto, 1995; Garfin, Silver, & Holman, 2020). Brennan & Binney (2010) explored guiltiness
in advertising, they found that moderate or low-level appeals may connect with consumers,
but if used in greater intensity guiltiness could be perceived as a blatant manipulation
attempts and may cause responses like anger, offense, or irritation. Drakulich (2015) found
that the excessive use of negative emotions in advertising may even produce mental and
physical health problems, such as social withdrawal from others, and engaging in
unnecessary social avoidance and protective behaviors.

Methods
To discuss the research questions, researchers performed a quantitative content analysis. In
this method, messages are the phenomena to be examined. This analysis distinguishes the
text as a reality produced in a way that has a significance for another person (Krippendorff,
2019). This method allows to show frequencies and patterns within the message content,
making it adequate for this researches goal. An a priori coding analysis was carried out. In
this design, codes are established deductively and are then applied by coders (Neuendorf,
2018).
Sample selection. Researchers extracted the studied advertisements from the digital archive
“Ads of The World”. This website receives the creative work sent by advertising agencies and
other professional sources from around the world, whose authors consider they are of prime
quality, about their creativity message, copy, art direction or similar accomplishments. In
5

March 2020, this catalog opened a special section for ads produced because of the
coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19 Ads Collection). TV and print ads were chosen for the
analysis, because this format comprises most of the work uploaded to the catalogue. The
inclusion criteria for the selection of ads was: (i) they must be made by a professional
advertising agency, (ii) they must be formatted for audiovisual or print media, (iii) it must
advertise a branded product or service, (iv) if it includes a copy it must be written using Latin
alphabet, (v) they should have been uploaded to the digital archive between March and June
2020. The sample comprised 376 advertisements. Two ads were excluded as they used a
non-Latin alphabet.
Coding unit and categories. Individual print and TV advertisements were defined as the
coding units. Researchers used the inventory of emotional appeals proposed by Czarnecka
& Mogaji (2019) as the set of a priori categories for analysis. These 15 appeals are divided
into two types: positive and negative emotional appeals, as exhibited in Table 3. Researchers
analyzed each of these categories in the textual and / or graphic elements of each unit.
Table 3. Positive and Negative emotional appeals categories (Czarnecka & Mogaji 2019).

Coding procedure and intercoder reliability. Both researchers independently coded the
sampled ads. The codebook was constructed based on the categorization of emotional
appeals by Czarnecka & Mogaji (2019) (Table 3, see also Tables 1 and 2). The coding sheets
were also prepared and discussed by both researchers. They trained by conducting
preliminary coding with a small sample of ads to ensure understanding of the codes’
definitions and consistency of the coding procedures established in the codebook.
Discrepancies in the coding were discussed and re-assessed. After two rounds of training,
the intercoder reliability obtained using Cohen’s kappa was 0.85, suggesting almost perfect
agreement.

Results
The number of ads analyzed from March to June was N=376. The selection of ads that
incorporated at least one emotional appeal was n=208, revealing that 55.3% of
advertisements included in the sample comprised this resource. Most of those ads used
positive appeals (72%), a smaller number employed a mix of positive and negative appeals
(21%), and a few advertisements only used negative emotional appeals (7%). The data
reveals that the appeals with highest use frequency were Nurturance, Affiliation, Sorrow,
Nostalgia, Excitement and Pride (Figure 1).

Regarding the evolution in the recurrence of use of emotional appeals in the studied
period, the data shows abrupt increases in April, and May compared to the other months

these appeals and the number of adverts uploaded to the catalog per month were positively
correlated, r(374) = .78, p < .05.
About the recurrence of positive and negative appeals during the researched time
span, the data revels a higher presence of positive appeals, with a peak in May, while negative
appeals evidence its highest use during May. Figure 4 shows the detailed evolution of both

Discussion
This study provides a comprehensive analysis of positive and negative emotional appeals
featured in early COVID-19 themed advertisements. The results show an increase in the
usage of emotional appeals as time passed since the beginning of the outbreak. This rise was
characterized by the concurrent use of different emotional appeals, which may indicate an
eagerness to enhance the strength of the messages, or mirror the mixed emotions that
individuals experienced in the uncertainty of the first months of the pandemic.
Nurturance was the emotional appeal with the highest frequency of use evidenced
among the sampled ads. This positive appeal is defined as one which evokes caretaking, such
as parents caring for their child’s health and well-being (Bleakley et al., 2015; MeadowsOliver & Hendrie, 2013). Or friends and members of the community caring for each other
needs. Studies have found that content related to nurturance is effective in health
communication (Bleakley et al., 2015). Affiliation was the second positive most often
employed emotional appeal. To be concerned with maintaining good relationships with kin
among other peers, to have friendship and social bonds, being a reciprocal and cooperative
person, are attitudes and actions related to affiliation (Hetsroni 2000; Mogaji, 2016; Pollay,
1983). Sloan et al. (2020) studied the extent to which North American citizens feared the
virus, and the results showed the subjects awareness about caring of others, especially
family members, close friends, and elderly relatives. Since the beginning of the coronavirus
outbreak, mass media campaigns have reinforced the idea of staying at home, to keep safe
and save others whom one appreciates. Affiliation and nurturance are not far from this
advice. Positive emotions appeals have featured more than negative ones in the sampled ads.
Marketers know that positive emotions pose less risk than negative ones when used in brand
communications (Chang & Chang, 2014; Czarnecka & Mogaji, 2019; Hornik, Ofir &
Rachamim, 2017; Marchegiani & Phau, 2013; Wu et al., 2018). This observation is consistent
with the results reported by Czarnecka & Mogaji (2019), when studying advertising for
financial services. They found those ads predominantly used positive emotional appeals,
such as relief, security and excitement, while they seldom used negative appeals.
Sorrow was the third preferred emotional appeal resulting from the sample. It was
likewise the most used negative emotion. According to the law of apparent reality, during
stressful moments the recommendation it to be cautious while recurring to negative
emotions, as they can be felt more intensely by consumers (Frijda, 1988). According to the
theory, individuals may have experienced sorrowful ads with more intensity than those
featuring emotions of affiliation or nurturance. As Mantovani & Tazima (2016) argue,
negative emotions have a stronger impact than positive emotions, an effect that can be true
in a stressful situation such as the pandemic. Advertisers use negative emotional messages
as sorrow to achieve a greater persuasive influence (Coleman, Royne & Pounders, 2020;
Coulter & Pinto, 1995). This strategy is not without risks, as Berger and Milkman (2012)
found that somber contents leads to less activation and decreases people’s motivation to
share content. Nostalgia replaced sorrow as the negative appeal of preference in the months
after the pandemic started. Nostalgia is grounded in evocations from the personal past, as
the individual recalls the way he used to be, memories made up of earlier events and
emotions (Havlena & Holak, 1991; Holbrook & Schindler, 1991; Stern, 1992). Consumers
long for the past when they encounter a loss of confidence in the future, or when reality
changes unexpectedly in the present (Clarke & Schmidt, 1995). Probably ad professionals
9

and their clients draw upon nostalgia during early pandemic to engage with the consumers
by referring to a better past, and project to a brighter future. For example, airline companies
were talking about how amazing air travel was, and the joys of visiting attractive
destinations before the lockdowns. These phenomena are consistent with Marchegiani &
Phau (2013), who argue that nostalgia is an effective emotional appeal to be adopted in
advertising when people confront insecurities, as they become more conscious of the past
and wish to remember it. Zhang et al. (2014) state that market insecurities give rise to a
circumstance in which nostalgia is a suitable emotion to relate with consumers. Same
authors suggest that sad contents in advertising causes empathy and emotional immersion
among buyers.
Excitement was the fifth most frequently featured emotional appeal. This emotion is
linked to pleasure, satire, wit, relief, positive mood, it provokes amusement, joy and fun
(Chang & Chang, 2014; Czarnecka & Mogaji, 2019; Hornik, Ofir & Rachamim, 2017; Li, 2019).
According to Hornik, Ofir & Rachamim (2017) and Li (2019) excitement is a strong emotional
appeal to relate with the consumers. Czarnecka & Mogaji (2019) noticed that excitement was
frequent in loan adverts, as it projected joyful experiences referred to acquiring a new car, a
holiday trip or home through bank financing. Chang & Chang (2014) also identified that
excitement works in ads for travel agencies, when linked to the expectation of visiting
pleasant destinations during the holidays. Excitement in the sampled ads related to the
enjoyment of spending time with friends, family or community members. An emotional
appeal that followed excitement was pride. It was particularly present in those
advertisements that told stories of strength and resilience, usually accompanied by epical
scores, and connected to a spirit of patriotism and love for the homeland. This narrative style
has been prevalent in ads during the pandemic (The Economist, 2020). Advertising cannot
forget its social responsibility. Emotions are currently exacerbated by the coronavirus
outbreak (Cowan, 2020; Huang & Zhao, 2020). According to recent research, socially
vulnerable members–Blacks, Hispanics, females, and youth–appeared to be at risk for
suicidality during COVID-19 (Fitzpatrick, Harris & Drawve, 2020). Advertising has a social
responsibility, which can be directed on promoting consumer behaviors that leave a positive
impact on their communities (Cowan, 2020; Huang & Zhao, 2020). In a situation such as the
pandemic, brand communication practitioners should make a thorough use of emotions,
using this resource to contribute to society, aware of avoiding giving rise to harmful attitudes
or practices. Specially in the near future, when Web 4.0 and 5.0 will favor the appeal to
emotions among individuals (Almeida, 2017; Kotler, Kartajaya & Setiawan, 2017).
A limitation of this study is that the sample was drawn from an archive of
advertisements whose content and cataloging is not regulated, nor does it respond to criteria
established a priori. Ads of the World is an open access web catalog where anyone related to
the creative and advertising industry around the globe may display their work. It is a wellknown inventory among practitioners, one where agencies from all over the world exhibit
their best creative work, although the norms with which they select each ad to be included
in the inventory is not standardized.
This study opens the possibility for future research to deepen in the effectiveness of
the sampled ads and show if the expected results were achieved within its target market. Li
(2019) states that different emotional appeals can contribute to various affective responses
between people and lead to particular communication outcomes. Turner (2007), argues that
10

the success of a message depends on whether the emotion matches the audience so that the
content is processed and not rejected. This statement coincides with Hong & Zinkhan (1995)
who explains that the emotion conveyed by the brand must synchronize the self-emotion
perceived by each individual to be effective. The effects originating from diverse audience
segmentations could be further analyzed. For example, Meyers-Levy & Sternthal (1991)
found that men and women differ in how information is treated, women exhibiting greater
sensitivity than men while making judgments. It would be possible to analyze the emotional
outcome of each advertisement among different genders, including its effect by age, cultural
and market contexts. Another topic would relate to the concurrent use of positive and
negative emotional appeals, as the research on this matter is not conclusive (Xie et al., 2004;
Gross, 2008). Further research could also examine the creative process that marketing
communications practitioners followed during when creating these advertisements, in such
uncertain time as the early pandemic months. Taking into consideration any budget
constrains from their clients, the challenge of having to produce the messages while in
quarantine, and the stress caused by worrying about their own health and that of their
special others. There is extensive literature on the motivation and factors that make up the
advertising creative process (Turnbull & Wheeler, 2017; Ahmad, Stufhaut & Labianca, 2017;
