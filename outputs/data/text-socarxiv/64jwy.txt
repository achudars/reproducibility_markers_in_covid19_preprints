Abstract
more cooking time and eating together; more prudent use of food; less food waste
This cross-national survey-based study examined in real time how the COVID-19 pandemic
impacted food-centric matters in 1,732 Chinese and 1,547 U.S. households during the stay-athome directives. Both cohorts reported increased efficiency in use of food, families spending more
time cooking and eating together, and more prudent use of food with less waste. Food purchasing
patterns shifted from frequent trips to the store to dramatic increases in online ordering. A small
proportion (11% Chinese, 2% U.S. respondents) reported clinically significant weight gains of
>4.5 kg. Household food insecurity worsened, with large increases in people worrying about or
experiencing food shortage. Collective grocery-shopping experience by survey respondents
indicated that the functional stability of food supply systems remained steady. All food types were
somewhat available, except for noticeably higher prices widely reported by the Chinese cohort.
This study offers insights into future food patterns and sheds light on long-term questions for
additional research about how people make decisions and food behavioral changes at times of
crisis and the consequences thereafter.
Introduction
COVID-19, first documented in China in December 20191, has since spread rapidly around the
globe. Stay-at-home orders and isolations have been in effect worldwide in an effort to slow down
the spread of the disease. As a result, large portions of the population have stayed home and
numerous businesses including restaurants and eateries have closed or suspended services. Caught
in the crisis, poorly prepared, and homebound for weeks or months, how did people fare in
sourcing food and keeping their families fed? How did household-level food security (or
insecurity) change during the crisis? Changes in food purchasing and eating patterns may also be
related to weight change, with several popular media outlets referring to a “quarantine 15.”
Growing media attention also highlights incidents of food flow disruption due to the pandemic,
from vegetables rotting in fields and milk being dumped, to food processing facilities running short
of workers due to the disease, to panic-buying activities occurring at retail stores. Strains on
multiple points of the food supply chain could affect food availability and prices at grocery stores,
ultimately impacting people at the receiving end2,3. With the food system subjected to a ‘perfect

2

storm’ because of the COVID-19 pandemic, what insights may be drawn from people’s experience
at the market-consumer interface regarding the integrity and resilience of the food system?
This study aims to address those critical issues by examining the food experience of Chinese and
U.S. households during the pandemic through real-time data collection using convenience and
snowball sampling methods. Our primary objective was to understand the impacts of the pandemic
on household food dynamics, such as food purchasing and eating behavior, aspects of food security
issues, as well as stress and self-reported body weight change. The secondary objective was to
assess food supply system stability during the pandemic from the viewpoint of grocery shoppers.
China and the U.S. are the largest countries most severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic
as of mid- to late-April, 2020 (when the survey was conducted). Examining people’s food
experience in these countries can help us better understand the ‘food-print’ of the COVID-19
pandemic. Such understanding is critical for developing innovative policies and mitigation
strategies toward a better and more secure food future. Patterns derived from the survey can inform
additional research for determining long-term consequences. Lessons drawn from the survey
cohorts with further investigations in the U.S. and China, two countries that feature distinct food
cultures with different food systems, may be applicable elsewhere.
Results
Characteristics of the U.S. and Chinese cohorts
Valid survey respondents totaled 1,547 in the U.S. for the collection period of April 17-27, 2020
and 1,732 in China (collection April 22-27). Characteristics of the two cohorts are presented in
Supplementary Table 1. At the time of the survey, the Chinese respondents had stayed at home for
about 7.5-10 weeks; 62.4% had household member(s) losing income because of the pandemic. In
comparison, the U.S. respondents had stayed at home for 4-6 weeks; 35.7% had household
member(s) losing income. A greater proportion of the U.S. cohort reported that household
members tested COVID-19 positive (0.41%) or had COVID-19-like symptoms (11.4%), compared
to the Chinese cohort (0% and 1.99%). Of other demographic parameters, the U.S. respondents
consisted primarily of women with age groups more or less evenly distributed, whereas the
Chinese cohort was younger with a narrower gender gap (Supplementary Table 1, Fig. 1). It is also

3

noteworthy that the majority of the U.S. cohort (>70%) were in charge of household grocery
shopping or meal planning/cooking (Supplementary Table 1), whereas the Chinese cohort had
about 1/3 indicating this role.
Household food dynamics
Food sourcing changed dramatically during the pandemic, consistently for both cohorts. First,
restaurant food ordering for take-out or delivery during the pandemic decreased in frequency
(Supplementary Fig. 1a). Money spent on such food had the same pattern (Supplementary Fig.
1b). Second, the vast majority (74% for both cohorts) reported making fewer grocery-shopping
trips during the pandemic than before (Supplementary Fig. 2). Meanwhile, online grocery
shopping for delivery or curbside pickup became popular, about 1/3 of U.S. respondents reported
doing so for the first time and 1/3 of the Chinese cohort reported community group-ordering for
delivery (Fig. 2). Many people in the Chinese and U.S. cohorts reported purchasing extra amounts
of various foods when grocery shopping (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Food-use behavior and perceptions changed, with both cohorts valuing food more during the
pandemic than before. For example, many reported throwing away less food and for various
reasons (Supplementary Table 2). In modern societies, food wastage can be reduced but total
elimination is unlikely4,5. For the survey respondents in both countries, spoiled fruits and
vegetables topped the list of foods thrown away during the pandemic (Supplementary Table 3).
This may be attributed to the extra-quantity purchases as well as the perishable nature of fresh
produce. In line with the heightened awareness of food being precious, most U.S. and many
Chinese respondents indicated making a second meal or snack of leftovers from restaurant food,
as well as being more prudent in meal planning or spending less money on meals (Supplementary
Table 2).
Importantly, a great many respondents indicated cooking home-meals more often (62% U.S., 60%
China) and household members spending more time cooking or eating together (48% U.S., 73%
China) (Supplementary Table 2). Meanwhile, use of ready-to-eat food items, such as frozen
dinners, was less frequent. The vast majority indicated no change regarding types of food
consumed during the pandemic as compared to before, although the number of people reporting

4

eating more of various foods exceeded those reporting eating less (Supplementary Fig. 4). By and
large, changes in household food dynamics and the food attitudes of survey respondents were
mostly positive/desirable, with patterns consistent for both the U.S. and Chinese cohorts. Some of
the changes may persist, as about half of each cohort indicated that the pandemic might have
changed how they will treat/handle food in the future (Supplementary Table 2).
Household food insecurity
The pandemic worsened household food insecurity (Table 1). Among U.S. respondents, over 10
times more people reported having worries about the ability to feed themselves or household
members during the pandemic compared to before (509 vs. 45 respondents). Twice as many people
indicated skipping a meal or going to bed hungry due to food shortage (33 vs. 16). Fortunately,
having access to free foods from government or charity organizations, for the households in
general (91 entries) or for school children (112 entries) in particular, helped relieve household food
shortage during the pandemic. With the Chinese respondents, food insecurity situation worsened
but to a lesser extent than the U.S. cohort (Table 1). Notably, households that were food insecure
were in the lowest income category (<$25,000 per U.S. household, <50,000 YMB per Chinese
household) or had family members who lost income during the pandemic (Table 1). There is a
need for rapid mobilization of effective intervention mechanisms to avert food shortage and to
protect those who are most vulnerable at times of crisis like COVID-19 (see more in Discussion).
Food-mind-body
The pandemic brought abrupt and unimaginable interference to people’s lives. In these challenging
times, both cohorts found solace in food. About 70% of both cohorts indicated food being a
pleasure/comfort element, a stress reducer, and a way to cope with boredom during the pandemic.
Still, the U.S. respondents were bearing considerable stress (Table 2): about 30% indicating “rather
much” or “very much” stress. In contrast, the Chinese cohort had just 7% indicating “rather much”
or “very much” stress whereas 61% indicating “only a little” or “not at all” (Table 2). Level of
stress was associated with age, household income level, and family members losing income during
the pandemic (Supplementary Table 4).

Regarding body weight change (Table 2), the highest proportion of each cohort (39.5% U.S.,
46.5% China) reported no change in weight; for the remainder, people reporting weight gains
outnumbered those reporting weight loss. What differentiated the two cohorts was a greater extent
of weight gain with the Chinese respondents, 11% gaining >4.5 kg (10 pounds) and 14% gaining
2.3-4.5 kg (5-10 lbs). In comparison, only 2% of the U.S. cohort reported gaining >4.5 kg and 11%
gaining 2.3-4.5 kg. Weight change was related to stress level; association with age or income level
was inconsistent for the two cohorts (Supplementary Table 4). Decreased physical (exercise)
activities were reported by a large portion of each cohort (43.3% U.S., 47.8% China; Table 2).
Food supply and availability
The COVID-19 pandemic is a test for the functional stability of food supply systems. The survey
asked what people experienced regarding food availability and choices when grocery shopping
(shelf-empty, limited choices, store limited how much one could buy, compared to fully stocked)
for nine food types (animal source food, fresh produce, processed foods, etc.) as well as two types
of beverages. According to the U.S. respondents, most foods were available but many had limited
options (Fig. 3a); reports of empty shelves were generally low (<10% of respondents) except for
rice/flour/dried beans and manufactured grain products, for which 26.8% and 20.3% of
respondents encountered empty shelves, respectively. Results from the Chinese cohort show that
by and large, all food types were well stocked (Fig. 3b), with some choice limitations but relatively
fewer shelf-empty reports. Food availability scores are >2 (U.S.) and >3 (China) for all food
categories (Supplementary Table 5), indicating that all food types were somewhat available.
Food prices held steady based on the experience of the U.S. cohort (Fig. 4a); 70-90% of the
respondents reported no price change, although 25.6% reported noticeably higher prices for
meat/fish/eggs. Results from the Chinese cohort indicated price volatility; noticeably higher prices
were reported by many for nearly all food types. About half of the Chinese cohort reported
noticeably higher prices especially for meats/fish/eggs, fruits, and vegetables (Fig. 4b).
To gauge people’s general confidence in food supply security, we asked “how did you feel about
food supply and availability in your area or the nation in general”. The U.S. cohort exhibited a
dramatic shift from broadly optimistic (29%) or not concerned (54%) before pandemic, to the vast

6

majority (74%) being somewhat concerned or very concerned since the pandemic (Fig. 5a). In
contrast, nearly 90% of the Chinese respondents indicated a high level of confidence (optimistic
or not a concern) before and during the pandemic (Fig. 5b). Age, income level, and loss of income
by household members during the pandemic were associated with the confidence of the U.S. but
not the Chinese cohorts (Supplementary Table 5).
Discussion
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food-centric matters was most acutely felt by the
U.S. and Chinese families with the lowest income or those who had household members losing
income during the pandemic. Deterioration in household food security was reflected by large
increases in people of the U.S. cohort worrying about being able to feed their families as well as
indications of food shortage in homes. According to Feeding America (a U.S.-based organization
with a national network of >200 food banks providing food assistance to those in needs,
pandemic or not), people seeking for food assistance increased 70% during the pandemic6. How
to build the resilience of those most vulnerable and food insecure households and to avert food
shortage at times of crisis remains a global as well as local challenge.
The positive changes of increased efficiency in use of food and families spending more time
cooking and eating together are in part direct consequences of the stay-at-home orders, as
individuals may now have more disposable time to spend on food preparation and less eating out
or ordering in. Positive food attitudes in more prudent use of food with less wastage may be
attributed to heightened awareness of food being in limited supply, close encounter and personal
experience of choice limitations at food stores, as well as uncertainties people were facing
regarding the trajectory of COVID-19 and food availability future. The durability of these positive
changes and how widespread the phenomenon might be across large populations deserve further
study. Pandemic or not, the world must find ways to feed the growing populations more
sustainably7. Reducing food loss and waste throughout the food chain, particularly at the consumer
level, is paramount8. Finding ways to sustain the positive change and to broaden relevant reach is
important.

Despite widespread media reports of the “quarantine 15”, most survey respondents indicated no
change in their weight. However, some reported clinically significant weight gains of greater than
4.5 kg in a short period of time. This group of individuals who rapidly gained weight may
constitute a higher risk group that may benefit from targeted diet and exercise counseling. Some
of them might have previously been on diets but with their routines drastically altered due to the
pandemic. This entails further study.
The food supply systems apparently retained its integrity and functionality, more so in China (in
terms of choice and availability) than in the U.S., based on the collective grocery experience of
survey respondents. But the collage of snapshots provided by survey respondents revealed caveats
and constraints, for instance, choice limitation and price volatility. Modern food supply chains are
complex with many actors, moving parts, and connecting points9,10. At times of crisis like the
COVID-19 pandemic, rapid response and quick activation of intervention mechanisms at the
national scale require flexibility in rule- and regulation-decision changes as well as adaptable
implementation at business operations. For example, to divert food previously purposed for bulk
distribution (schools, restaurants, etc.) to retail channels now requires government approval of
labeling and packaging changes as well as execution capacity at packaging facilities6. In fact,
during the pandemic, many entities worked in partnership to overcome barriers, bridge gaps, and
alleviate the shock and smooth the flow of foods. Further work is needed to systematically examine
what worked, where things went wrong, and what new mechanisms and strategies are needed to
boost the resilience of the food systems toward a better and more secure food future. It is also
interesting to note that how the phenomenon of online grocery-shopping will evolve postpandemic may have important ramifications on matters pertaining to the infrastructure of the retail
sector, their service mode, food safety and public health. Further investigation is warranted.

This study, through the lens of thousands of U.S. and Chinese respondents, describes the foodprint of the COVID-19 pandemic in multiple dimensions. Many changes occurred involving
household food dynamics with patterns consistent in both cohorts despite underlining differences
in food culture and eating habits as well as demographic characteristics. Considerable differences
between the food systems regarding food supply stability (availability and prices at the market-

8

consumer interface) may be related to a variety of factors, such as food sourcing (importation),
regulative measures and flexibility, distribution means and channels and their adaptability, as well
as the scope and efficacy of top-down interventions at times of crisis, among other things.
Differences in characteristics of the two cohorts might have had important implications for how
people have responded to the crisis as well as to survey questions. For example, the young
majorities of the Chinese cohort might be less prone to stress or life-changing uncertainties; instead
they might have derived more joy from delicious home-made meals while staying with parents
during the pandemic. Furthermore, people’s resilience at times of crisis can be deeply rooted in
historical, societal, and cultural background as well as personal traits and experiences; exploring
such elements and their connections and influences would be of great interest.
Using convenience-snowball sampling for real-time data collection, we were able to capture
people’s food experience as they encountered it amid the pandemic while staying-at-home. We
acknowledge potential limitations of the methodology, such as sampling is not representative and
findings are not generalizable11,12. Meanwhile, we recognize that methodology-related issues
might not fit the classic definition, because the pandemic’s impacts are so widespread and
pervasive and essentially encompassing everyone in the societies. We plan to conduct additional
work with more rigorous and strategic sampling for better representation of the population, and
findings from the present study offers insight into and shed light on long-term questions, to be
explored in further study, about future food patterns and how people make food behavior changes
at times of crisis and relevant consequences thereafter.
Methods
Survey design
The survey consisted of 53 questions (single or multiple, numeric or descriptive choices), to collect
data on: (i) demographics of respondents; (ii) parameters reflecting household food dynamics
(food purchasing, at-home food related activities, and food-use behavior); (iii) household-level
food insecurity parameters; (iv) food supply and availability indicators in marketplaces as
experienced by survey respondents; and (v) other relevant matters (stress level, body weight
change, etc.). The survey contained no identifier items, such as name, address, etc. The study was

9

deemed exempt from requiring human subjects approval by the Institutional Review Board of the
University of Pennsylvania.
The Chinese-language version was identical in content to the original (English) version except for
a few items that were adapted to be applicable to Chinese participants, for example, race/ethnicity
choices, household income range, height (in meters instead of feet) and weight (in kilograms
instead of pounds). The two versions were hosted on the same internet platform.
Survey distribution
After pilot testing, the cross-sectional survey was disseminated online. Initial distribution of the
English version was via the researchers’ professional and personal networks and their home
institutions. Broader dissemination was attained via snowballing through individuals’ social media
postings. In China, distribution was achieved by the researchers soliciting assistance from their
professional colleagues as well as personal contacts inside China; those contacts in turn spread the
word via their networks. In particular, a number of university faculty members recruited their
current as well as former graduate students, who were off campus and widely scattered across the
country during the pandemic, to participate in the survey as well as further dissemination.
Cross-sectional data collection started on April 17, 2020 in the United States, April 22 in China.
The number of daily responses spiked within 24 hours in each country and slowed down
substantially within 3-5 days. The slowing-down was more rapid in China than in the U.S. Data
collected during April 17-27 in the U.S. and April 22-27 in China were extracted for analysis in
this study. Valid responses (answering at least two survey questions) totaled 1,547 from 705 zip
code regions in the U.S. and 1,732 from 30 out of 34 Provincial-districts in China.
Data analysis
Raw data were exported to and analyzed in Stata (Stata Corp., College Station, TX). All analyses
were conducted with two-tailed tests of hypotheses and a p-value < 0.05 as the criteria for statistical
significance. Descriptive analyses include computation of means (with 95% confidence intervals
[95%CI]), standard deviations, medians, interquartile ranges (IQR) of continuous variables and
tabulation of categorical variables. Frequency counts and percentages were used for categorical

10

variables. Inference statistical analyses were conducted using the chi-square test for comparison
of categorical variables and ANOVA or t-test for continuous outcomes.
