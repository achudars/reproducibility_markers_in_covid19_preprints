Abstract
Introduction
In the UK, actual uptake of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID19, has exceeded expectations formed from studies conducted in 2020. However, it remains lower among
members of other than white ethnic groups, and among younger people. Some evidence exists to suggest
that the ethnic gap in vaccine uptake might be partially explained by lower trust, while one study carried
out before the vaccination programme rollout suggested that variation in vaccine hesitancy can be explained
by differences in trust and healthcare experiences, without reference to demographic variables such as age
and ethnicity.

Methods
In April 2021, data were collected from 4885 UK-resident adults, of whom 3223 had received the invitation
to be vaccinated against the novel coronavirus. Logit models were used to estimate the association between
probability of vaccine uptake and age, gender, ethnicity, household income, NHS healthcare experiences, and
trust in government, scientists, and medical professionals. Mediation analysis was conducted in order to
probe the relationship between ethnicity, NHS healthcare experiences, trust, and uptake.

Results
Gender and household income were not predictive of vaccine uptake. Age and ethnicity were predictive of
uptake, even after controls: younger people and members of other than white ethnic groups are less likely to
have taken up the invitation to be vaccinated. NHS healthcare experiences appear to mediate a relationship
between ethnicity and trust, and also to mediate some of the relationship between ethnicity and uptake (via
trust).

Conclusions
Members of other than white ethnic groups report inferior NHS healthcare experiences, which may explain
their lower trust in government, scientists, and medical professionals. However, this does not fully explain
the ethnic gap in coronavirus vaccination uptake.

Article summary
Strengths and limitations of this study
• The sample was large, providing high statistical power, and was designed for representativeness of the
UK adult population
• Standard measures of trust and healthcare experiences were used, providing confidence that these
variables have been measured robustly
• However, it was not possible to obtain a probability sample, and there was limited representation
within the sample both of people who did not take up the invitation to be vaccinated and of members
of other than white ethnic groups

Introduction

The problem of vaccine hesitancy, defined as ‘delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite availability
of vaccination services’ [1], has been recognised as a major global health problem for several years [2,3].
However, it has gained particular importance during the COVID-19 public health emergency: early in the
pandemic, it was estimated that as much as 82% of a population might need vaccination or natural immunity
against the disease before herd immunity could be reached [4], but one survey indicated that less than 72%
of the British population might be willing to accept vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus
which causes COVID-19 [5]. Multiple surveys found demographic disparities in British respondents’ expressed
likelihood of vaccine uptake, with younger, less educated respondents, women, members of lower income
households, and members of other than white ethnic groups all tending to express a lower probability of
accepting the offer of vaccination [6–8]. The finding with regard to ethnicity has been of particular concern,
given higher fatality rates for COVID-19 among members of minority ethnic groups [9]. Actual uptake has
been far higher than these surveys would have predicted, with one longitudinal study finding that 99% of
those who had stated in December 2020 that they would accept vaccination, and 86% of those who had stated
at the same point that they would not or were unsure, stated in February 2021 either that they would accept
vaccination or that they had already done so [10]. However, despite this encouraging trend, demographic
disparities appeared to persist [11], albeit at a reduced level, with youth and membership of other than
white ethnic groups now being the strongest predictors of coronavirus vaccine hesitancy in the UK [10],
such that by 13 January 2021, 42.5% of white people aged over 80 but not resident in care homes, but only
20.5% of black people in the same category, had been vaccinated [12]. The potential health consequences of
incomplete vaccination coverage were recently highlighted by the official claim that the majority of people
hospitalised as a result of a COVID-19 outbreak in the English town of Bolton were unvaccinated yet eligible
to be vaccinated [13].
The possibility that lower trust in government, scientists, and the medical system might lead to reduced
coronavirus vaccine uptake among members of minority ethnic communities had already been noted before
survey data of this nature had been collected [14]. Indeed, many studies have found a relationship between
hesitancy with regard to other vaccinations and mistrust in medicine and other relevant institutions, both
on an individual level [15–18] and on a national level [19]. Evidence now exists to suggest that coronavirus
vaccine hesitancy among African Americans may be driven by mistrust in the medical establishment and by
perceptions of racism in the political system [20]. Moreover, some experts have attributed heightened levels
both of coronavirus misinformation and of coronavirus vaccine hesitancy among members of some minority
ethnic communities in the UK to mistrust which they argue is in turn driven by experiences of racism,
discrimination, and exclusion [21]. This could be related to a UK study’s finding that trust in scientists,
medical professionals, and (to a much lesser extent) government is predictive of coronavirus vaccine hesitancy
[8]. The same study found that ethnic disparities were reduced but did not disappear following controls for
trust in these institutions, which may indicate the importance of other drivers. As members of minority
ethnic groups report lower patient satisfaction and worse healthcare experiences in the UK [22], and, on
an international level, appear to suffer from ‘higher incidences of healthcare associated infections, dosing
errors, [adverse drug events], and complications resulting from their care’ [23], it would seem plausible that
3

healthcare experiences (which were not assessed in the aforementioned study) may act as a driver of ethnic
disparities in coronavirus vaccine uptake, alongside strategic and situational trust. Moreover, it would appear
plausible that the range of mechanisms which can be assumed to generate the forms of exclusion associated
with racism might also be associated with decreased trust, more negative experiences of healthcare, and
higher rates of vaccine hesitancy among other groups, including women, young people, less highly educated
people, and members of low income households. In this context, it is important to note that a separate UK
study found that ‘[s]ocio-demographics do not explain vaccine hesitancy to any helpful degree’ and that the
major predictors of coronavirus vaccine hesitancy are ‘excessive mistrust’ and a lack of ‘positive healthcare
experiences’ [5]. These findings are startling, and urgently require interrogation through replication.
This article therefore reports on a pre-registered study designed in order to test for demographic predictors
of coronavirus vaccination uptake in the UK, both before and after controls for healthcare experiences
and for trust in the principal institutions associated with the UK’s coronavirus vaccination programme,
i.e. government, scientists, and medical professionals [24]. As the UK’s vaccination programme is delivered
by National Health Service (NHS) bodies in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, healthcare
experience items focused specifically on experiences of NHS healthcare. In order to provide the most robust
test possible, established instruments have been used to measure both trust and healthcare experiences,
rather than the novel measures employed in the aforementioned study [5].

Hypotheses

Given the above observations regarding published findings of existing research, the following expectations
were formed:
H1. Coronavirus vaccination uptake will be lower amongst female respondents
H2. Coronavirus vaccination uptake will be lower amongst younger respondents
H3. Coronavirus vaccination uptake will be lower amongst respondents of other than white ethnic groups
H4. Coronavirus vaccination uptake will be lower amongst less educated respondents
H5. Coronavirus vaccination uptake will be lower amongst respondents from lower-income households
H6. Coronavirus vaccination uptake will be positively associated with trust in government, medical professionals, and scientists
H7. Coronavirus vaccination uptake will be positively associated with positive experiences of healthcare

Methods
Study design

Trust was measured using Wellcome Global Health Monitor items Q11B, Q11E, Q14A, and Q15a [25].
Experiences of healthcare were measured using items adapted from the Scottish Government Inpatient
Experience Survey [26]. Responses to individual questions were numerically recoded and averaged to provide
a single measure of trust and a single measure of experience of healthcare. To facilitate analysis of individual
trust and healthcare items, responses to these items were separately dichotomised for use in additional partial
models, with the top two levels recoded as true and others recoded as false.
Education was operationalised as highest qualification received, which was dichotomised in order to distinguish degree-level (and equivalent) qualifications (including undergraduate and postgraduate degrees) from
lower levels of qualification, including lack of all formal qualifications. Ethnic group was also dichotomised
through coding as white or other than white. In order to accommodate respondents who do not identify as
male or female, gender was operationalised as a categorical variable with only two values: female and other
than female. However, all participants included in the survey identified either as male or as female.

The dependent variable is a dichotomous variable representing the condition of having been vaccinated
against the novel coronavirus (in the event that the respondent has been invited to be vaccinated) or of
being about to attend an appointment to be vaccinated (in the event that a respondent was surveyed
immediately after being invited to be vaccinated, and for that reason has not been vaccinated yet).
In calculating indices, missing values were ignored. Cases with missing data in relation to specific variables
were excluded from all analyses featuring those variables.

3.2

Data collection

Although there is no longitudinal aspect to the study reported here, the data collection formed part of a
longitudinal study in which each wave involves collection both from recontactees and from new participants.
Respondents were sampled at random from an Ipsos MORI recruited panel, with pre-stratification in order
to produce representativeness of the UK adult population on age, gender, geographical region, and working
status. Where representativeness was not achieved, additional respondents were obtained by Ipsos MORI
on a quota basis from panels maintained by other data providers. Data were collected from respondents
who have not been offered vaccination against the novel coronavirus, but data on those respondents were
excluded from this particular study, as they could not be used to test hypotheses about vaccine uptake.
Data collection was carried out online by Ipsos MORI. Fieldwork was launched on 01 April 2021 and completed on 16 April 2021. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Demographic weights were
calculated post-collection by Ipsos MORI on the basis of education and geographical region and of gender
interlocked with age, NRS social grade, and working status. Weights were calculated before exclusion of
cases where respondents had not yet been invited to receive coronavirus vaccination. Data were collected
from a total of 4885 respondents, of whom 1662 were excluded due to not having received the invitation to
be vaccinated. Numbers of included cases with missing values for each variable are listed in Table 1.
Ethical approval was sought and received from King’s College London. Ethical and data protection procedures at King’s College London, the University of Bristol, and Ipsos MORI were followed.

3.3

Statistical analysis

The sample was treated as equivalent to a random sample for analytic purposes. Hypotheses 1-7 were
tested through creation of binomial logit models with vaccine acceptance as the dependent variable. Of
most relevant interest are a partial model using only demographic predictors, and the full model featuring
demographic predictors and aggregate measures of trust and of experiences of NHS healthcare. Both of
these models were pre-registered. To further probe the findings of the confirmatory analysis (see below),
two further partial models were created without having been pre-registered. These included one featuring
demographic predictors and aggregate measures of trust only and one featuring demographic predictors and
aggregate measures of NHS healthcare only. In order to study the predictiveness of individual items, two
pre-registered models were also created, one featuring demographic predictors and dichotomised responses
to trust items as predictors, and the other featuring demographic variables and dichotomised responses to
healthcare experience items as predictors. To further understand the unexpected findings of the confirmatory
analyses, mediation analyses were conducted on an exploratory basis using non-parametric bootstrapping
with 10000 repetitions. Coefficients for all confirmatory and exploratory analyses are reported both as
estimates and as 95% confidence intervals.

White ethnic groups comprise white British, English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish, Irish,
Gypsy or Irish Traveller, and any other white background; other than white ethnic groups
comprise all other ethnic categories used in the 2011 UK census, including mixed ethnicities
Low household income = £24,999 or less; median household income = £25,000 - £34,999;
high household income = £35,000 or more

3.4

Power analysis

Post-hoc power analysis confirms that the sample was sufficiently large to detect even very small effects.
Given a sample size of 2773 (i.e. the number of observations which were sufficiently complete to be fitted in
the full model) and a cut-off of p < .050 (two-tailed), an association so weak as to reduce the probability of
vaccine uptake only from 95% to 91% across the entire range of a predictor variable could be detected with
approximately 98% power.

3.5

Patient and public involvement

It was not considered appropriate or possible to involve patients or the public in the design, or conduct, or
reporting, or dissemination plans of our research.

Results
Descriptive statistics and internal reliability

Cronbach’s alpha and Guttman’s lambda 6 were used to assess internal reliability of indices. The reliability
of items used to measure experiences of NHS healthcare was assessed as α = .88, λ6 = .87, which indicates
a high level of internal reliability. The reliability of items used to measure trust was assessed as α = .69,
λ6 = .66, which is a suboptimal level of internal reliability but likely reflects real differences in levels of trust
for different institutions (especially given that government trust may be acting at least partly as a proxy for
political preference).
Table 2 shows weighted and unweighted demographic descriptive statistics, first for the whole sample, and
then for respondents who did and did not accept the invitation to be vaccinated against the novel coronavirus.
Although respondents from median and above-median income households were treated as a single group
for modelling purposes, they are disaggregated here. Comparison with official statistics suggests slight
representation of white ethnic groups, which accounted for 86% of the population at the 2011 census, but
the sample was biased towards older members of the population as vaccination was offered in descending
order of age, and other than white ethnic groups have a younger age profile in the UK [27].

The mean age for respondents who had been invited to be vaccinated yet not take up the invitation is just
under nine years younger than the mean age for respondents who had been vaccinated. Percentages of male
and female and respondents in each group are identical. Percentages with low (below median) household
incomes for the sample are effectively identical, but the weighted percentage of respondents with high (above
median) household incomes for the sample is 4 points lower among those who did not accept the invitation to
be vaccinated (i.e. it was about 0.9 times as high). This suggests that the effect of income may be masked in
the confirmatory analysis presented in this article, as dichotomisation by separating low income households
from median and high income households was a pre-registered data transformation: a point to which we
shall return below. The weighted percentage of respondents educated to degree level was 4 points lower
among those who did not accept the invitation to be vaccinated (i.e. it was about 0.9 times as high). The
weighted percentage of respondents belonging to other than white ethnic groups was 9 points higher among
those who did not accept the invitation to be vaccinated (i.e. it was about 2.3 times as high). This is not
a large difference: by the time of data collection, 94% and 87% of invited members of other than white
ethnic groups within the sample who had received the invitation to be vaccinated had taken it up, which
implies that the great majority of members of all ethnic groups had done so. However, it is consistent with
the observation, discussed above, that uptake rates have been lower amongst members of other than white
ethnic groups.
Table 3 shows weighted and unweighted indices of trust and NHS healthcare experiences, first for the whole
sample, and then for respondents who did and did not accept the invitation to be vaccinated against the
novel coronavirus. Mean scores for members of the latter group were lower on both indices. Table 4 shows
unweighted product-moment correlations between pairs of variables. There was a strong correlation between
indices of trust and NHS healthcare experiences (r = .47), but NHS healthcare experiences were less strongly
correlated with vaccine uptake (r = .13) than trust was (r = .22), while trust was less strongly correlated
with membership of an other than white ethnic group (r = -.08) than NHS healthcare experiences were (r
= -.13). Age was negatively correlated with membership of an other than white ethnic group (r = -.27) and
with degree level education (r = -.09), but positively correlated with membership of a low income household
(r = .11) and with vaccination uptake (r = .14).

4.2

Confirmatory analysis

Table 5 presents adjusted odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) for dichotomous variables (female
gender, membership of an other than white ethnic group, membership of a low income household, and
education to undergraduate or postgraduate degree level) and for increases of 1 SD in numeric variables
(i.e. age and the indices for trust and NHS healthcare experiences). Age (AOR = 1.61, 95% CI [1.39, 1.87],
p < .001) and membership of an other than white ethnic group (AOR = 0.53, 95% CI [0.35, 0.84], p = .005)
were the only statistically significant predictors in the purely demographic model. Thus, the null hypothesis
can be rejected with regard to H2 and H3, but not with regard to H1, H4, and H5.
Controlling for indices of trust and of NHS healthcare experiences diminishes the effect associated with
membership of an other than white ethnic group from AOR = 0.53, 95% CI [0.35, 0.84], p = .005 to AOR =
0.61, 95% CI [0.38, 1.01], p = .046. This suggests that some of the effect associated with ethnicity may be
mediated by one or both of those additional variables. However, the same cannot be said for age. Indeed,
the null hypothesis can only be rejected for H3 with regard to this model at p < .050, but the coefficient
and p-value for H2 are virtually unchanged since the demographic-only model. Moreover, while there was a
significant effect associated with trust in the full model (AOR = 2.02, 95% CI [1.72, 2.37], p < .001), there
was no effect associated with NHS healthcare experiences (AOR = 1.02, 95% CI [0.86, 1.2], p = .820). Thus,
the null hypothesis can be rejected with regard to H6, but not with regard to H7.
This finding would appear to be in contradiction of the claim that vaccine hesitancy was largely explained
by trust alongside healthcare experiences, and that demographic predictors have little importance. Partial
models excluding trust or healthcare experiences are also presented in table 5. As the effect associated with
NHS healthcare experiences in the partial model excluding trust is very highly significant (AOR = 1.46, 95%
CI [1.27, 1.67], p < .001), albeit lower than the effect associated with trust in the partial model excluding
NHS healthcare experiences (AOR = 2.06, 95% CI [1.8, 2.36], p < .001, AOR = 2.06, 95% CI [1.8, 2.36],

p < .001), it seems plausible that the effect of NHS healthcare experiences on uptake may be mediated by
trust: a possibility to which we shall return below.
Table 6 presents adjusted odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) for increases of 1 SD in age and for
dichotomous variables, including dichotomised trust and NHS healthcare items as individual predictors.
Examination of coefficients associated with those items facilitates assessment of their individual predictive
contribution. All effects associated with trust items are statistically significant, especially those associated
with trust in medical professionals (AOR = 2.81, 95% CI [1.74, 4.49], p < .001) and with scientists working
in the private sector (AOR = 1.94, 95% CI [1.34, 2.78], p < .001). Thus, high trust in any of the institutions
mentioned was associated with increased likelihood of uptake, even after controlling for level of trust in all
the others, plus demographic variables. Interestingly, the only significant effect associated with an individual
NHS healthcare experience item after controlling for all the other items and for demographic variables was
that associated with having felt able to trust the staff (AOR = 1.62, 95% CI [1.01, 2.58], p = .045). In
relation to these models, the null hypothesis is still rejected with regard to H6, and may be partially rejected
with regard to H7.

4.3

Exploratory analysis

The above findings were suggestive of theoretically plausible mediated associations, i.e. that experiences
of NHS healthcare might be indirectly associated with uptake via trust, that ethnicity might be indirectly
associated with trust via experiences of NHS healthcare, and that ethnicity might therefore be indirectly
associated with uptake via both of the aforementioned. For this reason, additional mediation analyses were
carried out on an exploratory basis (i.e. without having been pre-registered). All of these analyses involved
the same demographic controls used in the confirmatory analyses.
There were three findings. Firstly, the relationship between membership of an other than white ethnic group
10

and trust appears to be 100% (95% CI [49%, 100%], p = .035) mediated by NHS healthcare experiences.1
Secondly, the relationship between NHS healthcare experiences and uptake appears to be 94% (95% CI
[56%, 100%], p < .001) mediated via trust. Thirdly, the association between membership of an other than
white ethnic group and uptake appears to be 24% (95% CI [8%, 100%], p = .026) mediated via NHS
healthcare experiences (which were not included in the model, given the second finding). This mediating
effect may plausibly be taken to account for the reduction in the effect associated with ethnicity between
the demographic-only model and the full confirmatory model.
While these findings are exploratory rather than confirmatory, they add weight to the above interpretation
of the confirmatory findings. On the one hand, they suggest that positive experiences of NHS healthcare may
be associated with higher vaccine uptake largely for the reason that they have a positive relationship with
trust in relevant institutions, and that membership of an other than white ethnic group is associated with
lower trust in those same institutions for the reason that experiences of NHS healthcare are less positive
among members of such groups. On the other hand, these findings also suggest that those intermediary
relationships can only account for some of the association between ethnicity and vaccine uptake. Most of
that association remains unexplained, as does the association between age and uptake.

Discussion

The finding that female gender, below degree-level education, and below median income do not predict
uptake contradicts several studies which measured vaccine hesitancy before the UK vaccination campaign
had got underway [6–8,10]. This discrepancy may be interpreted in terms of an attitude change potentially
attributable to public health communication, word of mouth discussion of coronavirus vaccination itself, or
many other sources (although it is also possible that members of certain groups simply under-estimated their
own likelihood of accepting vaccination).
The finding that age and ethnicity do, however, predict uptake even after controls for trust and NHS healthcare experiences is in contradiction of the study which found that vaccine hesitancy is largely explained by
mistrust and poor experiences of healthcare, to such an extent that demographic variables are not predictive
once these variables are controlled for [5]. Age is here found to remain a powerful predictor of uptake even
after those controls, and ethnicity also predicts uptake, albeit that this effect appears weaker after the same
controls. This reduction in strength of association appears to be the result of mediation by NHS healthcare
experiences, via trust. However, the mediation effect is quite small, appearing to account for about a quarter
of the variation in uptake which is associated with ethnicity within this sample. To summarise, this study
finds evidence that uptake of coronavirus vaccination is lower among members of other than white ethnic
groups, evidence that NHS healthcare experiences have a relationship with vaccine uptake that is mediated
by trust, and evidence that the lower trust in medics, scientists, and government among members of other
than white ethnic groups is mediated by their worse experiences of NHS healthcare. However, it does not
find evidence that worse healthcare experiences or lower trust can explain the majority of the ethnicity gap
in coronavirus vaccine uptake.
This suggests that lower rates of vaccination uptake among members of other than white ethnic groups are
likely to have drivers other than or in addition to mistrust of medical, scientific, and other authorities and
to negative experiences of healthcare (especially as experiences of healthcare turned out to explain little or
no variation in uptake beyond that which is explained by trust, their association with uptake being almost
entirely mediated by the latter). Such a finding could be viewed as an encouraging one: had the effect
associated with ethnicity been found to be entirely explicable in terms of worse experiences of healthcare,
then prospects of reducing it in the short term —- and especially under pandemic conditions — would
have appeared very bleak. That notwithstanding, the fact that so much variance remains unexplained is
in itself a cause for concern, and highlights the urgent need for further research to test the mediating role
of other variables. Possible candidates involve sources of information, conspiracy beliefs about the novel
coronavirus, and attitudes to vaccination in general [8]. Moreover, the finding that ethnic disparities in trust
— a vital component in public health — could be so closely related to poorer reported experiences of NHS
1 Linear

models with standardised predictor and outcome variables.

healthcare should serve as a reminder of the very real problem of ethnic disparities in healthcare experiences
and outcomes, whether those disparities can be assumed to have a population-level impact on coronavirus
vaccine uptake or not.

Limitations of this study

This study relies on self-report data collected, and as such, it is dependent both on respondents’ candour
and on their recall. Also, while much effort has been made to produce a representative sample, it was not
possible to obtain a probability sample. Moreover, as noted above, the focus on low income as a predictor (to
which the analysts were committed by the pre-registration document) may have concealed the importance
of high income as a predictor. Lastly, while the researchers were working with a relatively large sample, it
included only 187 individuals who did not take up the invitation to be vaccinated, and only 234 members of
other than white ethnic groups. Given that any effects associated with ethnicity must be disentangled from
those associated with age, which in this context functions as a confound (both because age had a stronger
association with uptake than ethnicity and because members of other than white ethnic groups were on
average younger than members of white ethnic groups in the sample, as in the wider UK population),
special caution must therefore be exercised in interpreting the results presented here. Further study of
relationships such as those focused on in this study, for example looking for variables that might mediate
the relationship between age and uptake, or that might explain the currently unexplained majority of the
relationship between ethnicity and uptake, might therefore benefit either from an even larger sample or from
deliberate over-sampling of individuals who have not taken up the invitation to be vaccinated, and perhaps
also of members of specific demographic groups.
