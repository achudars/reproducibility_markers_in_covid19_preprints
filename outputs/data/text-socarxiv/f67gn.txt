"7" "Abstract"
"8" "Aim:  Given the availability of both public health and social measures (PHSMs) and safe and highly-effective vaccines against covid-19, we aimed to assess the feasibility of covid-19 eradication, relative to the benchmarks of smallpox and polio (albeit only 2 of 3 polio serotypes eradicated to date)."
"9" "Methods:  Our scoring system was partly based on previously published factors favouring the eradicability of vaccine-preventable diseases. But it was also supplemented by additional technical, socio-political, and economic factors that we considered relevant."
"10" "Results:  On our scoring for eradication feasibility using a three-point scale and across 17 variables, the mean (total) scores were smallpox at   2.7 (43/48), then covid-19 at 1.8 (30/51), and then polio at 1.5 (26/51).  More specifically for covid-19 eradication, animal reservoirs may potentially prevent it; but the main challenges are probably around the high upfront costs and achieving international cooperation. Nevertheless, an advantage for covid-19 eradication over these other diseases is that effective PHSMs can complement vaccination and there is very high global interest in covid-19 control (due to the massive scale of the health, social and economic burden)."
"11" "Conclusions:  In this preliminary analysis, the feasibility of covid-19 eradication globally seems  slightly more feasible than for  polio, but much less than for smallpox eradication. There  is a need for a more formal expert review of feasibility and desirability of attempting covid-19 eradication by the World Health Organization or coalitions of national health agencies."
"12" "Introduction"
"13" "Elimination and eradication of disease are among the ultimate goals of public health 1   (for definitions see Appendix).  Vaccination  has  globally  eradicated  smallpox, rinderpest  (a  viral  cattle disease  that caused famines 2 ) , and two of the three serotypes of poliovirus. 3   Three o ther vaccine-preventable diseases are eradicable  globally  with current technology , 4   with  measles  the leading contender  and with MMR vaccination  potentially  eradicat ing  mumps and rubella  at same time .   Some other diseases are close to being eradicated but without use of vaccines eg, via the Guinea Worm Eradication Programme with only 54 cases of d r acunculiasis globally in 2019 5 )."
"14" "But is covid-19 also  potentially  eradicable  as opposed to letting covid-19 become a  controlled  endemic disease ?  Commentators have  dismissed the eradication  goal as impossible , 6   ignored its future possibility , 7  or focused on  the challenges of reaching  herd immunity . 8   Yet, there seems no  obvious  reason  why  p rogressive elimination and eradication  is  im possible . H erd immunity is not required for  c ovid-19  elimination  and was  not  how  smallpox was eradicated."
"15" "As proof of concept for eradication  of covid-19 , several countries and areas have achieved elimination without vaccination  with  the use of  new and established   public health and social measures (PH SMs)   (eg,  border  control , physical distancing, contact tracing etc) .  Such successful countries  included  those  with large land borders such as China, but also island nations such as  Australia and New Zealand (albeit with occasional outbreaks from border control failures that were brought under control). 9   There  are  review  articles  suggesting the effectiveness of  a range of  PHSMs interventions  including travel-related controls, 10   on mass masking, 12  and specific studies on the effectiveness of  border  quarantine systems . 11"
"16" "Comparisons with smallpox and polio   for  eradicability"
"17" "In the table below we consider established technical factors  that  favour the eradicability of vaccine-preventable diseases ,  published in 1999. 4  We added to this list additional  technical,  socio-political ,  and economic factors  that are likely to favour  attempting  and achieving  eradication.   We then made comparisons between smallpox, polio, and covid-19 using available literature. Of note is that while two of three wild serotypes  of the poliovirus  have been  declared to have been  eradicated globally (in the years  2015 and 2019 3 )  –  there is still wild virus circulating in Afghanistan and Pakistan  and there remain important challenges to success , 13   including vaccine-derived spread in  some  countries . 14"
"18" "On our scoring for eradication feasibility  using a three-point scale and across 17 variables,  the mean (total) scores were smallpox at  2.7 (4 3 /4 8 ),  then covid-19 at 1.8 (30/51), and then  polio at 1. 5  (2 6 / 51 )  (Table 1) .   Possibl y  the biggest technical concern to the chances of  covid-19 eradicability  (relative to smallpox and polio)  is the risk of  the  persistence of the  pandemic  virus in non-human animal reservoirs.  Nevertheless,  animal infections with SARS-CoV-2, both domestic and wild,  appear to be  rare to date . 15   Also any infections among f armed animal s   could potentially  be controlled by quarantining and culling.  In addition , covid-19 vaccines for domestic animals could be developed  (as they were for the eradication of rinderpest 2 )  and oral vaccine in bait has effected successful regional elimination of rabies in wild foxes. 16  Furthermore, the problem of  Guinea  worm infection in domestic dogs has not stopped the global eradication efforts for that disease from continuing , 5  since various non-vaccination control measures can be successfully used in dogs."
"19" "In terms of socio-political and economic factors, the world has changed a lot since smallpox eradication and even since the major advances with polio eradication. For example,  the earlier eradication campaigns  did not have the problem of social media disseminating misinformation  about vaccination   (which is a problem for covid-19 control, Table 1).  Nevertheless, possibly the major challenges for covid-19 eradication are the high upfront costs (for vaccination and upgrading health systems) and achieving the necessary international cooperation. For example, with the latter there have been vaccine shortfalls with the  COVAX  Programme: “about 200 million doses behind where we want to be”. 17  Also  there are concerns about “new vaccine nationalism” and government-mediated “antiscience aggression”. 18"
"20" "On the other hand ,  the massive scale of the health , social and economic  burden from covid-19  in much of the world means that there is unprecedented  global  interest in disease control and massive investment in vaccination against the pandemic.  There is also the advantage for covid-19 eradication over these other diseases in that PHSMs can be highly effective and can potentially complement vaccination. This  context  might mean that a n   “ expected value ”  analysis  could ultimately   estimate that the benefits outweigh the costs, even if eradication takes many years and has a significant risk of failure."

"156" "Potential next steps"
"157" "The  preliminary  evidence we have collated suggests th at further work on the potential for eradication of covid-19 should be performed. This work  w ould ideally be done by the World Health Organization ,  but failing that it could be done by  coalitions of  various national level  agencies eg,  country equivalents of the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention  or ministries of health . Any expert review   needs to consider two main questions: ( i )  could   c ovid-19  eradication   be  technically  feasible  with currently available technologies ;  and ( ii)  should  eradication  be attempted based on its  desirab ility  in terms of benefits vs costs   and  the  risk of failure ?   Such a  review  should include  at least all the factors we have considered  (Table 1)  and take a long-term perspective on the benefits  and costs .  It should also take a more sophisticated approach by giving the different categories weights and also making comparisons with measles (where elimination has been achieved at times for large regions eg, the Americas 40  and for which “existing tools may be sufficient to reach minimal conditions for eradication”. 5"
"158" "Assessing the desirabil i ty of  attempting  c ovid - 19  eradication  is the hardest question as it need s to  consider  this  approach  compared with  the  alternative scenarios of endemic infection, with varying levels of suppression and mitigation  (potentially informed by integrated health and economic modelling eg, by Blakely et al 41 ) .  The costs of accepting endemicity could be very high and include the ongoing global health burden of acute and post-acute morbidity and mortality, and the potential further emergence of new variants with less favourable clinical outcomes and decreased susceptibility to vaccines (requiring addition al  vaccine development and additional  vaccination  campaigns).  For example, seasonal influenza imposes ongoing costs of US$11.2 billion per year in just one country: the United States. 37"
"159" "The potential co-benefits  of covid-19 eradication , such as  strengthening   health  systems globally  and improved surveillance systems ,   would  also  need to be considered . But so should  the  opportunity costs  eg,  would  a global focus on  covid-19 eradication divert attention from  addressing potential  global threats  that  may  pose existential risks  to humanity  (eg, from  nuclear weapons, synthetic biology  and artificial intelligence 42 ) ?   Similarly, would a focus on covid-19 eradication divert resources from broader improvements in health systems or even addressing the  7·69 million deaths and 200 million disability-adjusted life-years attributable to smoking annually? 43"
"160" "Even if eradication is not considered the optimal  long-term  global  response to the  c ovid-19 pandemic ,  elimination might still be useful as an  interim strategy  for some countries . This approach can allow countries to minimise the public health and economic harm caused by the pandemic while waiting for sufficient information to decide  on the best long-term strategy. 9"
"161" "If a n  expert review recommend ed  attempting global eradication, high-income countries  could then  commit to providing further  additional  funds to low-income countries for  strengthening   the necessary health systems,  running covid-19 vaccination campaigns (whether through the COVAX programme or other mechanisms) , and expanding the  appropriate  use of PHSMs .  Ideally such efforts could  strengthen these health systems ,   and particularly vaccination infrastructure,  to the point where the other vaccine-preventable diseases (including measles, mumps, and rubella) are also eradicated in the next decade ."
"162" "Conclusion s"
"163" "In this preliminary analysis, covid-19 eradication seems  slightly more  feasible t han   for  polio   (albeit only 2 of 3 serotypes eradicated to date), but much less so  than  smallpox . There  is a need for a more formal expert review of feasibility and desirability of attempting covid-19 eradication by the World Health Organization or coalitions of national health agencies."
