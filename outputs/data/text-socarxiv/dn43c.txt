"23" "Introduction"
"24" "In response to  the  COVID-19  pandemic , restrictions of varying stringency have been imposed by governments   around the world  to suppress the virus .  In the UK,  mitigation  measures  including   self-isolation, mobility constraints and the closure of all but essential  workplaces  have  been implemented   in efforts  to minimise contact and transmission 1 .  Whilst  some   occupational  groups  have navigate d  these  measures  through flexible working practices  (e.g. home   working)  and economic support (e.g.  ‘ furlough ’ ) ,  those employed in  ‘essential’   keyworker  occupations , incl uding healthcare, transport  and   education   among others ,   were   mostly  exempt from  such  strategies 2 . Consequently,  many frontline keyworkers  have   continue d  to work throughout the pandemic , often  at increased  risk of  exposure  to  and acquisition of COVID-19 3-5 ."
"25" "The psychological demands of working  through  the COVID-19  pandemic   have attracted a substantial amount of academic interest .   H owever, t o date,  research   ha s  primarily focused  on the  experiences of  health  and  social  care  workers (HCWs) 6-12 .   These  studies  have  document ed   elevated  levels of stress 11 , anxiety 10  and depression 9   through increased workloads, changing work conditions,  and  feelings of helplessness 6-12 .  HCWs   have  also endured longer working hours with inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) 7 ,  and  have reported  fears  of   infection  for  themselves and their families 8 12 .  There is evidence that previous epidemics ( e.g.,  SARS and MERS) p osed  similar  work-related stressors  and subsequent   demands on the psychological wellbeing of  those working in health and social care occupations 13-15 .  Conversely, there is some evidence that HCWs may also experience positive outcomes from working throughout pandemics, including  a renewed sense of purpose,  contribution  and reward 8 12 ."
"26" "R esearch investigating   the  experiences of   non-health  keyworkers   (hereafter ‘keyworkers’)  such as  those employed in  transport, retail, education and various other public services   is limited 4 .   Nevertheless,  similar to  HCWs,  emerging  data suggest s   that  these  keyworkers   are  experiencing elevated stress and anxiety  during the pandemic .  A  recent publication  on grocery store workers in the United States   found   increase d   anxiety and depression   among   employees   with direct exposure to customers  (e.g. cashiers ) 4 .  Correspondingly,  a   case   study  of  a single  UK supermarket  employee  described  how customer behaviours, inadequate PPE and  the absence of  workplace  mitigation  policies   induced  fears of COVID-19 transmission 5 ."
"27" "D espite these similarities ,  many ke y workers   face distinct   occupational  vulnerabilities   that  have received little consideration within broader debates about essential work  and  psychological  distress  during  the pandemic .   First, there is evidence  that some keyworkers (e.g. transport workers)  have  increased   vulnerability  to  COVID-19  due to age, pre-existing health conditions, ethnicity and area of residence 3 . Being at  increased   risk of  COVID-19  susceptibility   is likely to  have  a detrimental impact on mental health and wellbeing  due to  the  perceived  negative  consequences  of infection ,  as   documented in studies with older adults 16  and  those with long-term health conditions 17 .  Second,  many keyworkers , particularly those from low- income ,  service ,  or elementary  occupations ,  may  face financial challenges that increase susceptibility to COVID-19 2 .  Although the Coronavirus Act 2020 extended S tatutory  S ick  P ay (SSP)   to all UK employees, the scheme is based on contractual hours. Part - time employees, or those reliant  on overtime,  may  therefore  be  unwilling  to take leave or self-isolate due to substantial reductions  in  wages 2 5 . Alternatively,  some  key workers may face   financial hardship  if they   choose  to or   are required to self-isolate ,  which may induce  mental distress 18 19 ."
"28" "Accordingly, there is a need for in-depth data on  keyworkers ’ experience s   during the pandemic   to aid our understanding of specific  work-related  stressors   and   to  inform  future psychosocial support  for this group  as  the  COVID-19  pandemic   persists ,  and ,  in  prepar ation  for other infections ( e.g .  seasonal influenza ) . To these ends, the study aimed to explore qualitatively the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the  working lives and mental health  and wellbeing  of  UK  frontline keyworkers."
"29" "Methods"
"30" "The research employed a qualitative design using semi-structured interviews with  UK  keyworkers. The study formed part of the UCL COVID-19 Social Study 20 ,   which  explor es  the  psycho social  effects of COVID-19 and  associated restrictions  on adults in the UK. Participants were interviewed between September 2020 – January 2021 about their working experiences throughout the pandemic, including any implications for mental health and wellbeing. Ethical approval was provided by University College London research ethics committee [Project ID 14895/005]."
"31" "Sample and recruitment"
"32" "Eligibility was based primarily on whether the person was a  non-health care  keyworker   ( as defined by UK Government criteria 21 ) ,  aged over 18,  working during the pandemic ,   and living in the UK. Participants were purposively recruited to ensure diversity of gender, age, and occupation  via  social media, personal  contacts  and the UCL COVID-19 Social Study"
"33" "newsletter and website.  P articipants were provided with both verbal  and   written information  about the purpose of the research ,  and  informed  that their involvement was  voluntary . All participants sign ed  a consent form to indicate their agreement to  participate, and   provided  demographic  information .  "
"34" "Data collection "
"35" "Interviews were conducted by TM (research fellow in social science), RC (research fellow in public health) and SE (research assistant) via telephone or video call.  All interviewers were  experienced qualitative health researchers educated to at least postgraduate level.  Interviews followed a topic guide that posed questions about the participant’s experience(s) of the impact of the pandemic on work, social life and mental health and wellbeing. Interviews lasted an average of 45  minutes, and   were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim by a professional transcription service. Participants were offered compensation in the form of a £10 high street  e- voucher. Data collection continued up until the point at which instances of data emerged consistently, or where no further data would develop new properties, categories or findings (i.e. theoretical saturation) 22  ."
"36" "Patient and Public Involvement"
"37" "Participants or members of the public were not involved in the design, conduct or reporting of the study, nor the dissemination of findings. Participants will be provided with study result upon request, however. The findings will also be disseminated to the public through social media and newsletters (e.g., March Network)."
"38" "Data analysis"
"39" "Following anonymisation by the lead researcher (TM), transcripts were uploaded to NVivo version 12 software for analysis. Analysis began with  researchers  familiarising themselves with data by reading through the individual transcripts. Following this, three transcripts were initially read independently by two researchers (TM and HA), who coded and discussed any emerging codes of potential significance to the research objective. A preliminary coding framework, informed deductively by concepts within the topic guide, was used to guide this process, although an inductive approach was also used to refine the framework in correspondence with any emerging concepts within the data. This was then applied to the  remaining transcripts by TM, who re-read transcripts and coded and synthesised text into categories, which were subsequently analysed and grouped into themes 23 . To ensure that the final extracted themes were not just the personal interpretation of one team member, the qualitative research team met weekly to discuss and iteratively refine any new codes or themes  that emerged . "

"71" "Figure 1. Key themes"
"72" "P erceptions of personal vulnerability"
"73" "Fears of contracting COVID-19"
"74" "The majority of  participants relayed fears of contracting C OVID -19  whilst at work . Some had underlying health conditions that heightened  these  anxieties:"
"75" "‘I was probably more worried than some are, that I might be more prone to catching it. Because  I’ve  got asthma, I’ve got chronic sinusitis, and I just thought, if this is a respiratory thing, you’re buggered’ (supermarket worker 1)"
"76" "Others were less fearful of the implications for themselves but expressed concerns about becoming a source of transmission. Some lived in households with vulnerable family members,  including  elderly parents and children with underlying health conditions ( ‘ because of my personal circumstances at home, I had two people in their 70s and an asthmatic child. The stress and worry and fear of me basically bringing that home to them was just crippling me’ ,  supermarket worker  2 ) , whilst others were more concerned about contracting and transmitting the virus   to  vulnerable members of  the public  ( ‘ I also  don’t  want to give it to anyone else. I might see someone who’s vulnerable, so I’m conscious that it’s not me I’ve got to worry about, it’s everyone else ’ ,   police s t aff ). Working in environments that posed significant risks to themselves and others was ,  therefore ,  a source of anxiety:"
"77" "‘I was so anxious about going to work with the coronavirus. I was quite paranoid. I used to dread leaving the house every day, going into work. It was really, really hard ’  (bus driver 1)"
"78" "Exposure  r isks"
"79" "Participants noted specific exposure risks at work that prompted fears of contracting COVID-19.  Some  reported governmental and organisational   delays in initiating and implementing protective actions, including workplace instructions aimed at mitigating transmission . As a result,  many continued to work without organisational guidance during the initial stages of the pandemic, which  prompted  feelings of vulnerability :"
"80" "‘ So, that first week was  really important  to me, because we weren’t really protected. We didn’t know what the crack was about face masks .. .. w e  were  driving around in buses for that week that didn’t have protection, what we call an assault screen, you know, something that separates you from the passengers on the bus … and we were thinking, jeez guys, anything could be going on here ’ (bus driver 2)"
"81" "Similarly,  most  participants   reported   the inadequate provision of workplace PPE .  Some noted initial delays in receiving  equipment  through their employer  ( ‘h and sanitiser came in, I think, probably three, four weeks after lockdown started ’ , bus driver  3 ) , whilst others described limited  ( ‘ s ometimes we don't even have soap in the bathrooms ’, delivery driver )  or no supplies  ( ‘ w e weren't given any kind of PPE . Nothing was offered ’,  supermarket worker  2 ) .   In some workplaces, such as on buses and in supermarkets, o ther protective measures  including   daily antiviral cleaning and enhanced   sanitation were often inadequate:"
"82" "‘ There are aspects of it that worry me. I don’t think in some ways  [the supermarket] is  the most hygienic place in the world ’  (supermarket worker  1 )"
"83" "Working  closely with  the public was an additional concern among some keyworkers.  Some noted how  some members  of the   public   did  not  always   conform with social distancing  guidelines  or  the wearing of  PPE   ( ‘ there are people not getting on with masks when they should, or if they are wearing  one  they are wearing one under their chin. I would say 80% of people are being compliant, but then  you’ve  got 20% of people who don’t give a monkeys ’, bus driver  4).  Others reported how the public  would  also , at times,   behav e   inappropriately around staff . This was often frightening for participants:"
"84" "‘ I mean, we did initially have some young lads come in who were actually deliberately coughing and sneezing, both on colleagues and other customers. And it really freaked a lot of people out because people were genuinely in fear ’( supermarket worker 2)"
"85" "Relatedly, some  keyworkers  worked in  confined spaces that were unconducive to social distancing ( ‘social distance is quite hard at the depot to do’, delivery driver ) , or worked with colleagues who  did not follow social distancing rules .  The inability to  properly socially distance elevated fears of potential exposure :"
"86" "‘ I don't feel very safe … because many, many drivers arrive and they meet with other people as well and I don't know where they are or who they are   … a  few of them was coughing …a nd they said, oh it’s just a cold. But you think it’s a cold but how I supposed to know that it’s not ’  (delivery driver)"
"87" "Virus mitigation strategies"
"88" "To mitigate concerns about contracting and transmitting the virus,  participants  often enacted their own mitigation strategies. Some reported  purchasing  and wearing  their own  PPE (‘ I got my face mask, I got a cloth one...I have started wearing a hoodie as well, just to cover me whole’, bus driver   6 )  and sanitising their workspace  ( ‘ I  took my own bleach solution and soapy water solution   and was cleaning everything in the cab…we were all bringing our own  stuff in … just to be safe’ ,  bus driver  4 ) . Such measures were acted out in the absence of inadequate PPE provision:"
"89" "‘ There  was  no hand sanitisers. There was nothing. Absolutely zero. Even during lockdown, for the first part of it, there was nothing at all. It was down to the drivers ’  (bus driver  4 )"
"90" "Whilst these measures enabled participants to psychologically cope with stressful working conditions, they did not always prevent family members or loved ones from feeling anxious about possible transmission. To reduce these concerns, some keyworkers  would  therefore   ‘decontaminate’  upon re-entering their home :"
"91" "‘ So  when I come from school, I literally strip off at the door. Everything goes into a  bag,  everything gets cleaned off. I  don’t  talk to anyone or touch anyone. I don’t go near anyone until I’ve decontaminated ’  ( teacher  1 )."
"92" "Others  temporarily   separate d  from anxious loved ones by either sleeping in separate bedrooms ( ‘ [husband]  went in the  spare room , so he kind of lived in the  spare room  for a long time, so that we were distanced ’,   s upermarket worker 1 )   or moving out of the ir home .  One bus driver, for example,  moved to  rented accommodation  to protect his wife from the risk of infection . Such  measures, whilst deemed necessary, induced additional psychosocial strains among keyworkers, including loneliness and isolation:"
"93" "‘[I feel]  Very lonely … I’ve been with [ wif e] since 1990.  We’ve  always been together, always done things together and to suddenly be sitting in a room on your own is quite dire. It upset me at first. I cried myself to sleep for a few nights, you can’t believe this is happening ’ (bus driver  4 )"
"94" "Work-related challenges"
"95" "Increased workload burdens"
"96" "The pandemic presented  several  work-related disruptions and challenges. Staff who were infected with COVID-19 or had been in close contact with a case were required  to  self-isolate . This often  result ed  in staff shortages :"
"97" "‘ During lockdown, we were decimated with staff. We were absolutely on our backside…so, I was  actually out  on weekends, on Saturdays, driving vehicles supporting the operation leaders. We didn't have enough staff ’   ( waste operative )"
"98" "Insufficient staff numbers resulted in increased workloads and longer hours, often without extra pay (‘ we’re doing more hours. They increased the length of the shift.  We’re  on a salary. We’re not hourly-paid so obviously, when we were due to do a shorter  shift  we would still get a long one ’,  bus driver 4 ). Some participants  were also  required to perform additional  or new  duties to relieve workload burdens , which were an additional source of stress:"
"99" "‘ We’re totally doing jobs that we never did before, because we’re answering the telephone calls, because our call centre is in India, and they’re on total lockdown… s o, that part I find stressful ’ ( bank worker )"
"100" "The stress of  i ncreased workload burdens  and  carrying out   new tasks beyond  usual  levels of  expertise   would,  a t times,  lead to tension and conflict within the workplace:"
"101" "‘A lot of friction, people just snapping at each other over the slightest thing. It would just set people off. A couple of times, I had to intervene.  Guys,  calm down. Jesus, boys. What are you  doing?... behave yourself … I was having to stop people pulling lumps out of each other’ (waste operative)"
"102" "Additionally, those  who transitioned to online working (including police,  teachers   and bank workers) welcomed such changes ,  but  noted difficulties. Tasks that were previously performed with  ease  proved more challenging when working from home ( e.g.  communicating with colleagues ) . Some also  reported being ‘overloaded’ with virtual meetings:"
"103" "‘ Because  it’s  virtual and I chaired a meeting the other day and I said, look, I need to eat, I need to get up. Because what you  don’t  see is, we have a meeting here now, and then say yes, bye, and then I’m straight into another one. . . s o I think there’s been a huge overload ’  ( p olice  staff   2)"
"104" "Lack of recognition and support"
"105" "Although some participants were appreciative of the support they received from the public, some  felt  undervalued, particularly in comparison to NHS health care workers whose work was recognised regularly in public gestures of appreciation (e.g., clap for carers):"
"106" "‘They deserve the respect they get, the NHS people, and they should. But I think a lot of people forgot about there's people out there like myself on the railway, bus drivers as well. And there's been really, not much for people, like  myself , in the frontline’ ( platform  staff)"
"107" "Internal  recognition  ( i.e.  from management)  was also limited ( ‘ Internally, from management…I don't think the recognition has been as wide as it could or should be ’, waste  operative ).  In particular, keyworkers  felt that the risks they were exposed to were not fully acknowledged or appreciated  ( ‘ I felt stressed. I felt uncomfortable. I felt vulnerable. I felt neglected. I felt everything because the company still  don’t  think it’s serious ’ , bus driver  5 ) .  Some  felt  that   profit was  sometimes  prioritised over  staff  safety:"
"108" "“ M anagement  don’t  give a crap  about staff. They just care about the things that goes in the till, which is the money. And they  don’t  want to pay sick pay .   There was another one … his wife was a  teacher  and she was told to self-isolate. So obviously, he should have been self-isolating, because there was an outbreak at the school. He was told by the manager of the store just to come in, it wasn't a problem ”   (supermarket worker 2)"
"109" "Disempowerment"
"110" "Despite concerns about contracting COVID-19, many participants felt that they had to  work  for fear of  financial implications or punitive measures . Some were concerned that protracted absence s  would result in disciplinary action ( ‘ But the particular academy chain that I work for has said that if teachers are not available to work from day one when they come back, then it will be disciplinary ’ ,  teacher   1 ) or   job loss:"
"111" "‘ People  were genuinely scared because the government was saying this and your manager’s going, no, you do  this  or you don't have a job…you can't afford not to be there or to lose hours or to lose your job’ (supermarket worker 2)"
"112" "P articipants reported opportunities to take furlough or sick leave but noted the financial implications of doing so.  For example, s ome  participants (particularly supermarket workers, bus drivers and police  staff ) relied on  overtime to supplement their income . However, additional hours are not accounted for in SSP or furlough schemes . Any absence would subsequently result in financial hardship:"
"113" "‘I worked all the way through since the beginning. I was given the choice of furlough, but I turned it down…it would have been such a drop in money, it would have put a financial hardship on us’  (bus depot supervisor)"
"114" "In this context, m any keyworkers  recognised that they  had no option but to continue working (‘ I just thought, well, I either stay at home and do nothing and go unemployed, or I carry on working. And that was literally my two options. There was no middle’ ,  bus driver 3 ).  Some  reported feeling   powerless, and  resigned themselves to  the possibility of contracting COVID-19 :"
"115" "‘ And in my line of work, being on the frontline, there's probably a high chance that I am going to probably get it at some point. And you just resign yourself to the fact ’  ( platform   staff)"
"116" "Discussion"
"117" "The findings presented in this paper are particularly valuable as, to date, non-healthcare keyworker voices are largely absent within broader debates about ‘essential’ work and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic 4 . Therefore, this study provides new insights into the psychological impact of frontline work during the COVID-19 pandemic, including how non-healthcare keyworkers  respond  to  and experien ce  previously identified occupational risks, including insufficient PPE 2  and the inability to socially distance 4 ."
"118" "By far  t he most prevalent stressor   was  the fear of contracting COVID-19.  T hose  who continued to  w ork  close  to others or in  environments  unconducive  to social distancing   reported feelings of  exposure and vulnerability.   Consistent with research  with  HCWs ,  f eeling unsafe and vulnerable to infection  are  predictive of poor mental health .   F rontline HCWs , for example,   were  more likely to  experience  greater  psycho social  distress  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic and  previous   outbreaks  because they  were  likely to have the most direct patient contact 12 24 25 .  This is not dissimilar from   recent data   documenting  elevated psychological distress among supermarket workers unable to socially distance at work during the  COVID-19  pandemic 4 5 .   Although   i t appear s  a  similar  awareness of  one’s  vulnerability increased  feelings of anxiety among our sample, our findings  highlight additional occupational  factors  and working conditions  that compounded fears of contagion, including the inadequate provision of PPE and  organisational  delays in initiating and implementing protective actions aimed at mitigating transmission."
"119" "In response to   these risks , many participants   enacted  their own  risk reduction practices, including purchasing PPE, s anitising  their workplaces and  temporary separation from family members .  Whilst such measures helped   reduce feelings of exposure, they   also  reinforce  widespread  concerns from keyworkers and public health officials  regarding  the inadequacy of PPE provision for those in frontline occupations  during  the pandemic 2 26 .   This is potentially  concerning  for the wellbeing of keyworkers, given  that   previous research has highlighted  how   precautionary  workplace measures, including  sufficient  PPE and infection control measures ,  are  associated  with decreased levels of conc ern and emotional exhaustion among HCWs 24 27 . The provision of  protective measure s  by employees  is also  likely  to reduce the need to  enact  mitigation strategies  ( e.g.  temporary separation)   that  may  trigger additional  psychosocial burdens   (e.g.  loneliness, isolation 10 ) ."
"120" "Workplace  challenges also  posed  several   additional stressors. Increased workload s   were common and  led to  elevated   feeling s  of stres s  and  subsequent  workplace   tension  and conflict .   W orkplace  unity   ha s  been found to be  an   important source of   support   and  resilience  among HCWs  during the COVID-19 10 12  and previous pandemics 15 28 ,  however ,  t his protective factor  was  not  experienced  b y  keyworkers in our study .  Similarly,  whilst  HCWs  may  experience   comparable  workload  challenges ,  these are often endured  alongside  enhanced public and organisation al  recognition  for  their eff orts  ( e.g.  clap for carers).   Among HCWs, g reater recognition  -  both publicly and organisationally  -  ha s  been shown to produce protective mechanisms linked to resilience, including a renewed sense of purpose,  contribution  and reward 8 12 .   T he  absence  of  similar  public and organisational   appreciation  limited  the emergence of any ‘positive’ psychosocial effects occurring among those in our study.   Hence , many keyworkers  experienced  workplace challenges in the absence of protective and support mechanisms proven beneficial to other  occupational  groups."
"121" "M any participants  reported feeling powerless  to  the situation .  This was primarily due to fears of financial hardship o r  disciplinary action.  Indeed,  t here is evidence  that some keyworkers,  particularly those   p art-time  or  heavily reliant on overtime ,  may be unwilling to take leave or self-isolate due to substantial reductions  in  wages 5 .  Many participants  reported similar concerns and that they   had no  option  but to continue working , despite  concerns about possible infection .   Conversely, those who  did take leave , whether through SSP or furlough,  reported  income losses.   This is  a  particular  concern  given  how COVID-19 induced economic hardship is having adverse effects on the psychological wellbeing of the population 29 30 ."
"122" "These findings should be considered  in light of  a number of limitations.  First, while this study provides unique and important insights into keyworkers' experiences during the pandemic, the timing of the interviews may need to be considered when interpreting the findings .   The majority of  interviews were conducted between September  and  November 2020 . Whilst this meant that participants were able to recount both current and retrospective experiences during periods of lockdown and more relaxed measures, as the pandemic is ongoing, experiences are still evolving . Second, this study may be limited by a sample biased toward those motivated or willing to participate. There is the potential that the views and experiences of those unable or unwilling to participate may differ from those in this study ( e.g.  unaffected by working conditions) and have therefore not been documented. Finally, our data covers a range of keyworker occupations, which, whilst useful in terms of coverage, may limit specificity. Where possible, we have attempted to draw out any distinctions between occupations in the data."
"123" "Our study has some important implications for policy and organisational practices.   First,  our findings suggest that  sufficient  protective  measures in workplaces  are urgently required , as m any  participants  report ed  feeling exposed and unsafe .  The inadequacy of governmental and organisational responses to the pandemic is highlighted by the fact that some enacted their own mitigation practices to prevent exposure to and acqui sition of  COVID-19 .  Hence, the  provision of adequate PPE ,   strategies aimed at reducing interpersonal contact  (including temporary accommodation, as has been provided for some HCWs 31 ) ,  and  repeat  and routine   employee testing are but   a number  of  measures that should be pursued to safeguard  keyworkers  who continue to operate on the frontline 2 . For keyworkers who are most at risk, an increased range of actions is needed to protect them from exposure, given that   the most vulnerable workers (whether due to underlying condition, age,  ethnicity  or financial situation)  reported  the greatest concerns regarding work-related stressors.   Second, adequate and accessible financial support must be provided to safeguard keyworkers' health during this pandemic and beyon d .  This is especially important for those  keyworkers , who, due to the nature of their job,  are unable to access furlough  schemes  or sick pay  because of   worries about  financial loss 32 33 .   Third, learning from the  experiences  of keyworkers in  other occupations ( e.g.  HCWs)  may assist with planning interventions designed to assist resilience in pandemics .   Some   HC Ws  have  not ed  the importance of  public  recognition and social support  in  minimising the psychological impact   of the  COVID-19  pandemic 12   and other  infectious disease outbreaks 24 .  Our data suggest a need to provide similar recognition for those working in occupations detailed in this study to buffer negative psychological consequences .  Finally, while these measures may help  mitigate  the immediate psychological effects of the pandemic, it is worth noting that many of the  psycho logical   demands  experienced by keyworkers and  highlighted in this article existed well before the advent of COVID-19 ,   including   occupational stress 34-36 , low levels of job satisfaction 35 37  and  burnout 38 . Hence, although support for  keyworkers  is needed now more than ever,  workplace support packages   must be  provided beyond this period to address long-standing problems  for  those employed in keyworker occupations ."
"124" "Conclusion"
"125" "This  study  highlight s the  psychological  impact of the COVID-19 pandemic  on those  employed in frontline keyworker occupations in the UK.  Participants reported  anxiety  about COVID-19 exposure and transmission to others,  especially  their families.  These fears were often  endured  in the context of multiple exposure risks, including insufficient PPE and workplace support .  Keyworkers also experienced work-related challenges, including increased workload s ,  a  lack of recognition, and a sense of helplessness .  This study therefore contributes to understandings of how the  intersections of  personal  vulnerability  and work  conditions  produce unique risks and challenges among those in frontline occupations."
"126" "It is hoped that by  recognising   the voices of those  who do not feel adequately  supported,  protected  or  valued  for their work  may be an initial  step  in  understanding the psychosocial and occupation al  support  non-healthcare keyworkers need ,  both as COVID-19 persists and in similar future scenarios."
