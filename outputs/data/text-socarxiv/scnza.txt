Abstract
The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak that emerged from Wuhan, China in 2020 has seen unprecedented
restrictions on civilian populations in many countries in the attempt to curtail the spread of the
pandemic. A recently developed model of general collective intelligence predicts the properties of
group decision-making systems that are required to optimize collective outcomes, along with predicting
that authoritarian systems of decision-making might tend to be restricted to non-optimal group
outcomes in ways that are somewhat hidden in that they require an understanding of this new and
relatively unknown model of general collective intelligence. In light of this model of general collective
intelligence, the economic restrictions imposed to combat the pandemic take on a new light, since these
restrictions have not only resulted in economic lockdowns for some countries, but in some cases have
also effectively imposed martial law. The hidden cost of this reduction in civil liberties is explored from
the perspective of the cost of an authoritarian decision-making system resulting in non-optimal group
outcomes as theorized by this model of general collective intelligence, using models of government
inefficiency to assess the cost of those non-optimal group outcomes, and therefore the hidden cost of
reduced civil liberties.
Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 has seen unprecedented measures by governments to restrict the
movement and activities of both citizens and potential foreign visitors in order to curtail the virus.
Measures to restrict the movement of the sick have long been common. During the times of the black
plague in the 1600s, by some accounts the sick would be padlocked into their homes along with the
healthy, and a cross painted over the door of the household in bright red, for any households in which
even one individual had been infected [1]. But never before have the healthy been restricted in such
numbers along with the sick [2].
One-Sided Depiction of the Problem, Mass Fear, and Public Support of Authoritarian Control
Mathematical models for the spread of the pandemic may be driving this extreme response by some
governments. However at least some of those mathematical models, by the admission of their own
creators, don’t take into consideration the deaths related to economic factors, and other factors that
might be related to a reaction that is too extreme. In support of this conclusion, Ira Longini, a modeler
at the University of Florida, says of such concerns “we should probably hook up with some economic
modelers and try to factor that in” [3]. In the absence of this information, and with the lack of any welldefined methodology for distinguishing where extreme actions are irrational and where more moderate
actions might be insufficient and might put the public at risk is a challenge. Mass fear is a natural
consequence [4].
Observation of the spread of the virus has proven that the spread of COVID-19 is likely to kill people.
However long lockdowns to slow the spread of any pandemic can also have catastrophic economic
impacts that may themselves affect public health. “It’s a three-way tussle,” say Gabriel Leung, a
modeler at the University of Hong Kong, “between protecting health, protecting the economy, and
protecting people’s well-being and emotional health” [3]. However, given that such models of the
impact of economic factors on health and mortality already exist [5], [6], a more interesting question
than understanding the economic impacts of shutdowns is understanding why such important

information that already might exist, in many cases doe not appear to have been incorporated into
public policy.
Because in support of Dr. Longini’s concerns, past observation has proven that the hardship which
might come from shutting entire economies down, as many are recommending in fear of the spread of
COVID-19, might affect health and well-being to the point of killing people as well, particularly if that
shutdown triggers economic collapse [7]. Given that economic collapse or the absence of economic
collapse cannot be predicted with complete certainty, a great deal of caution is warranted [8]. Events in
Venezuela leading up to the year 2020 prove how devastating an impact economic collapse can have on
mortality rates [9], [10].
But even within relatively intact economies people are still killed by economic hardship. The number
of people killed by economic hardship in the United States can be viewed from different perspectives:
Category of Economic-Related Death in the US Number Per Year
Deaths of Despair

Estimated at 150,000

Lack of Healthcare

More than 26,000

Individual-level Poverty

133,000

Though there is still some degree of uncertainty about how lethal the COVID-19 pandemic actually is,
even these numbers are potentially significant with respect to the mortality levels expected from the
pandemic.
Potential Indicators of Irrational Focus on Fear in the COVID-19 Response
One overall estimate of the mortality rate of the COVID-19 virus is 0.66% [11]. But estimates vary. By
some accounts the fatality rate for covid-19 in China appears to be as below [12]:
Age
80 and older
70 to 79
60 to 69
50 to 59
40 to 49
10 to 39
Children under 9 (reported)

COVID-19 Mortality Rate
14.8%
8%
3.6%
1.3%
0.4%
0.2%
0%

However, there is some reason to suspect that testing methodology might lead to systematic errors in
these numbers [11]. Factors like the failure to test for immunity indicating the subject had contracted
COVID-19 at any time, rather than presence of the live virus indicating the subject had COVID-19 at
the time of testing, might lead to over reporting mortality. In addition, potential government reluctance
to report actual mortality rates might lead to under reporting of mortality. Both contribute to uncertainty
in the actual numbers.
If the covid-19 virus is indeed ten times worse than the flu as stated by some, and if the number of
deaths in the US from the flu is approximately 41,000 per year [13], then the US might expect 410,000
deaths from covid-19. But by contrast, the number of cancer deaths in the US are 606,880 per year.
Some suggest cancer deaths can certainly be reduced by over 50% more through lifestyle and other

changes, resulting in a potential 300,000 lives per year. If this current concern over covid-19 is strictly
a rational result of considering the risk, why not a similar effort for cancer?
Covid-19 is one of many coronaviruses that include the flu [14]. Even though flu vaccines exist no one
has ever been able to "cure" the flu or any other coronavirus because of the number of strains due to
their constant mutation. The consensus opinion among scientists appears to be that the covid-19 virus
cannot be contained, and that all that can be done is to slow the spread so that healthcare facilities aren't
overwhelmed [15]. By some estimates the majority of the population in the US will be exposed to the
virus over the next year in any case. So even if staying withing the capacity of the health system to
provide ventilators, staying within the capacity of the healthcare system to provide doctors, nurses, as
well as masks, cleaning supplies, medications, and other necessities will save lives, when the capacity
of the healthcare system is taken into account, what is the total difference in lives saved between the
population getting exposed now and getting exposed over the course of a year? Does it amount to 98%
of fatalities avoided? Does it amount to 2% of the fatalities avoided? At what point does the benefit in
lives become more than the cost of the economic shutdown in lives?
Do these figures justify closing schools given the low mortality rate for pre-school or school aged
children and teachers? Or do they justify taking special measures with elder care facilities? In the case
of India, the shutdown of public railways and other transport with little notice was reputed to have
forced scores of migrant workers to walk sometimes hundreds of kilometers back to their villages.
Rather than remove them from exposure, this may have made that entire population more vulnerable
[19], [20]. Perhaps a fitting reminder is that no one has ever been able to keep dry by mopping up the
ocean. Better to stay out of the ocean oneself than waste all one's resources trying. Given the cost in
terms of human lives that might be posed by economic collapse, is it worth examining other more
targeted strategies in which the most vulnerable (perhaps those 60 and above) are kept isolated [16]?
The Hidden Force towards Authoritarianism in the Absence of General Collective Intelligence
A recently developed Functional Modeling Framework (FMF) theorizes the properties required for
individual or collective cognition [17]. This framework has been used to develop a model of collective
cognition (General Collective Intelligence or GCI). Since GCI in this framework is defined as having
general problem solving ability, this model of GCI is proposed to be unique among group decisionmaking systems in having the capacity to reliably define and solve any general problem within human
capacity to conceive. This is achieved through the ability to converge on selecting solutions that
maximize collective outcomes in problem domains where other models are proposed to face potentially
hidden constraints that might prevent them from having the capacity to converge on optimal solutions,
or on any solutions at all [18]. Without collective intelligence to provide a balance of decentralization
in decision-making, this theoretical model of GCI suggests all systems of decision-making have a high
degree of (in some cases hidden) centralization because the mechanism for massive decentralization of
all processes is simply lacking.
Centralization of in any group process, including those involved in research, manufacturing, or any
other part of the life-cycle of any product or services, is projected to result in increasing inequality in
favor of the process owner, and therefore decision-maker. In turn, increased resources as a result of
increasing inequality facilitates greater ownership and control over more of these centralized decisionmaking processes. Because technology removes the constraints to storage and consumption of
resources it also potentially removes the bounds to inequality so that the interests of the process owner
(in this case the provider of the products and services), being unbounded, act as a “tax” that steadily
shifts decision-making so that it drives decisions towards serving their interests. If centralized control is

equivalent to authoritarianism, this hidden force towards greater centralized control is equivalent to a
force towards authoritarianism.
The General Relationship Between Mass Fear and Authoritarian Control
The impact of mass fear is often for the citizenry to call for government leaders to take decisive action,
which in turn requires control. And mass fear is very effective at encouraging a country’s citizenry to
cede that control in the hope of gaining protection [21], [22]. Restricting the movement and freedom of
people at such an unprecedented scale as has occurred with the COVID-19 crisis may have introduced
a level of state control over individual liberties that has not been seen in the history of mankind during
peacetime [23] - [26]. History has shown us that once taken away, these liberties might not fully be
restored. The level of autocratic control that is stable depends on many factors [27]. And the level of
autocratic control that is maintainable with the current level of surveillance, big data, and other
technology that enables the state to precisely target it’s immense weight on individual citizens who are
no longer anonymous may now be greater than ever. This increasing level of control by the state over
the personal affairs of the individual also has a hidden cost in terms of human lives because there is no
system of collective intelligence that ensures the decisions they make with all that power the citizenry
gives up will be in the citizenry’s best interests. Instead, the control the citizenry gives up may end up
being used to do things decision-makers wanted to do anyways to serve their own vested interests [28].
Inadvertently Fomenting Fear as the Path of Least Political Resistance
Forces that systematically drive a reduction in civil liberties in response to fear and crisis do not need to
be driven by any unprovable conspiracy theory. Such forces need not even be intentional. Whatever
party is ruling during a time of fear-inducing crisis might lack any direct political or economic interests,
either locally or internationally, which might be served by a more authoritarian regime. But even for
cases in which this is true, focusing disproportionately on popular fears that tend to lead to more public
support for authoritarian action might simply be the most expedient action in terms of increasing public
support. Using the example of crime, as stated by Chevigny, P., “in democratic countries, at least in the
western hemisphere, there has been a political trend toward appealing to the fear of crime as a popular
issue in electoral campaigns, as well as more generally as a way of attracting public notice” [29]. In
other words, when the public is prone to fixate on a given fear, that fear becomes the most effective
channel of communication. And when the public is fearful, the best way of gaining public support is to
take strong authoritarian action.
Elected politicians are in the end all engaged in a popularity contest. Even small nation-states with few
or no multi-national business interests, are run by individuals who must seek re-election, either for
themselves or their political allies. Trying to convince a population of the need for taking a balanced
perspective in order to productively maximize collective well-being, rather than speaking to their
unproductive fears, is not an effective strategy when no measures for success in the strategy of
maximizing well-being exist.
Fomenting Fear to Further Interests of the Ruling Elite
In some cases however, national or international corporate interests of the political class or their allies
might be perceived as having the potential to incentivize leaders to use fear to manipulate the
population to serve a pre-existing agenda. One prominent example could potentially be the war with
Iraq in which significant reluctance among the American population to go to war was overcome
through the fear of "weapons of mass destruction" the populace was filled with. America didn't get
safer by finding and removing any weapons. The weapons didn't exist. But to the misfortune of those
who can only be thanked for having proudly served their country, America did manufacture a great
many physically and mentally disabled veterans. If there is any truth in the assertion that some of

America’s decision-makers were in fact driven by interests in the oil, military contracts, and other
business, as well as interests in regional control, which they and their cronies might have wanted in the
first place, then exchanging the well-being of military men for such cynical goals shows how fear can
be manipulated [29].
The Cost of Authoritarianism
As mentioned, without a system of collective intelligence to guide collective decision-making, the selfinterest of decision-makers is like a "tax" that constantly extracts value from all interactions. The more
power decision-makers are given in a group decision-making system in which decisions can’t be
adapted to maximize collective well-being, the greater the cost of that tax in human lives. This tax is
the cost of authoritarianism.
Assuming that a general collective intelligence has the capacity to find any strategy or other
intervention with the capacity to maximize efficiency at achieving collective well-being per capita per
unit of resources, then the cost of this authoritarianism can potentially be assessed by assessing the cost
of the current ineffectiveness of governance [30] -[33].
Conclusions
In general, reductions in civil liberties might occur due to an increase in anarchy in which case control
flows from the individual to no one, or due to an increase in authoritarianism, in which case control
flows from the individual to some entity. In the case of an increase in authoritarian control, that control
might be given up by the citizenry in the course of seeking protection from some immediate threat.
However authoritarian control as a decision-making system may tend to be aligned with the interests of
those in control of decision-making. And the misalignment of their interests with the collective wellbeing has a cost. Systems of General Collective Intelligence are designed to use the reasoning strategies
available to them to maximize collective well-being. This cost, the difference between decisions that
maximize collective well-being, and decisions that maximize the interests of those decision-makers, is
a natural consequence of all group decision-making systems that lack general collective intelligence.
And as decision-making continues to further centralize in the absence of GCI, this cost may continue to
increase.
The "change engine" theory of GCI suggests that a wide range of collective impacts, including
potentially existential challenges like the Sustainable Development Goals, are not reliably achievable
without GCI. This theory also suggests that GCI can make these impacts reliably self-funding, so that
these impacts are reliably achievable at a scale large enough to be transformative. Given that the United
Nations estimates a $23 trillion USD gap between the funding required to achieve the SDGs, and the
funding that is available to do so, if GCI is capable of bridging this gap as believed, the value of being
able to implement GCI is at least that $23 trillion.
For this reason, the most important cost of authoritarianism is that as a centralized system of decisionmaking, it has the potential to make a largely decentralized system of decision-making like GCI
impossible unless the potentially one single entity in charge of that authority wishes to implement it.
And in such an authoritarian system the support of any such single entity might be statistically difficult
to gain since the lack of GCI is measurably outside the tendency for any individual entity to see as a
problem, and since GCI itself is measurably outside the tendency of any individual entity to see as a
solution. That support might even be impossible if GCI is outside the capacity of the required
individual entity to see as a problem or as a solution.

GCI is a system with the capacity to optimize collective well-being per unit of natural and other
resources. If a given standard of well-being is being targeted with a given amount of such resources,
the theory suggests that GCI is required to have the capacity to reliably achieve that standard of
collective well-being. Mathematically, if well-being is a function of resources per capita, the only other
way to reliably achieve a given standard of collective well-being is to reduce the population. One might
believe their are too many people on the earth anyway, but such a population reduction might require
much more authoritarian governance. One might welcome such authoritarian governance from the
point of view that if that entity was benevolent, governance by a benevolent entity would be a positive
for a law abiding citizen regardless of whether that entity was authoritarian. However, the theory of
GCI suggest that any authoritarian entity that does not implement GCI can't optimize well-being, and
therefore by definition has interests that are not aligned with the maximization of collective well-being,
and cannot be benevolent.
When assessing the cost of a reduction in civil liberties, rather than assessing the cost of government
ineffectiveness as a measure of the difference between collective well-being achieved and maximum
collective well-being, a much more manageable task is then to assess the cost of achieving the SDGs
where the cost of achieving them can't be covered otherwise. In other words, a simpler way of
assessing the cost of a reduction in civil liberties is by equating that cost to the $23 trillon SDGs
funding gap.
