Introduction
The first COVID-19 case in India was confirmed on January 30, 2020. By March 22, 2020, as

the number of positive cases grew, several state governments had issued orders to contain the spread of
the disease, shutting down schools, malls and restaurants and urging people not to congregate for social,
religious or sporting events. On March 22, 2020, the Prime Minister called for a People’s Curfew
(“Janata Curfew”) urging people to stay home for a day. This served as a prelude to the key action of the
Government of India to slow down the spread of COVID-19 that came on March 24, 2020, when the
Prime Minister announced a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, until April 14, 2020 and eventually to
May 3, 2020 and then yet again to May 31, 2020. India’s lockdown was unusual, compared with those
in other countries, because it was announced with only four hours’ notice, giving people little time to
prepare for what would come to be known as among the most stringent implemented worldwide,
according to the "Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker".4
Although, in principle, the lockdown allowed free movement “essential” commodities and was
supposed to allow food markets to function without impediments, in reality, those involved in food
supply faced insurmountable challenges, including intermittent closure of wholesale markets for
agricultural produce (Rawal and Kumar, 2020) and restrictions and disruption on movement of vehicles,
both across state borders and within cities.5 It is estimated that more than a hundred thousand trucks
were stuck on highways (Ramakumar, 2020). Fishermen who were out at sea on the night of the
announcement returned the next morning with their catch, unaware of the lockdown announcement, to
find no buyers.6 The police appeared to enforce the lockdown with an iron hand, forcing many street
vendors of fresh produce to suspend their business and others to restrict hours of operation.7 Ecommerce and micro-delivery operations of food and groceries ground to a halt.8 Reports of harassment

The stringency index is based on publicly available information on 13 indicators representing government
response and includes those such as school closures, travel bans, internal movement restrictions, etc., fiscal or
monetary measures and measures tackling the disease itself. (Hale, et al 2020)

As per the Annexure to the Ministry of Home Affairs Order 40-3/2020 dated 24 March 2020, while commercial
establishment of food were exempt from the lockdown, manufacturing and transport was permitted only for
essential commodities, implicitly including food.

In fact, several reports emerged of policemen harassing and roughing up people who stepped out to buy their
groceries. At least two cases of Public Interest Litigation (PIL) were filed in the Supreme Court of India seeking
action against police for enforcing the lockdown mercilessly disregarding the guidelines that permitted consumers
to venture out for shopping for essentials.

of delivery agents by the police surfaced in many places.9 Transporters were reluctant to risk plying
their vehicles for fear of being stopped.10 In the cities, many of these food retailing activities depended
on migrant workers, who had left the city post-lockdown, compounding the operational challenges for
many in the food retail sector. Several workers and traders chose to stay home fearing exposure to
Covid-19. Wet markets for fish and meats as well as weekly farmers’ markets ceased to operate in many
cities across the country.
In the immediate aftermath of the lockdown, consumers in the city were panic-buying. As for a
substantial proportion of workers in the city who depended on daily wages, loss of work meant that they
began relying almost entirely on meals and rations provided by civil society and voluntary organizations
or the government. That hunger posed as great a risk to life as the virus became a refrain of many
migrant workers (SWAN, 2020; Seth & Vishwanathan, 2020).
Apart from supply side disruptions, there was a collapse in demand as well. With thousands of
eateries, restaurants, institutions shut and an exodus of migrant workers, demand for many commodities
such as milk plummeted. Many milk cooperatives took drastic measures and stopped procuring milk
from their members to cope with reduced demand.11 Early accounts of agri-food supply chains thus
convey a sense of chaos, uncertainty and anxiety.
This paper seeks to examine select aspects of the consequences of the lockdown on food
markets in India, focusing mainly on wholesale and retail food prices in urban India. We focus on the
period, March 24-July 31, 2020. Until May 31, 2020 much of the country was continued to be under a
lockdown and thereafter, lockdowns continued in some districts in the country where the COVID19
cases were higher. We bring together evidence from two main sources: First, we analyze daily price data
on 22 commodities and 114 cities across India, collected and published daily by the Government of
India.12 We also draw on three rounds of a survey of retailers, conducted by student volunteers from 21
locations in 14 cities across the country that captures the experiences of urban food retailers and also
documenting prices of select commodities.13
Our analysis has several limitations. We do not discuss rural food markets, where a majority of
Indians live and has likely swelled with migrants who have returned home from the cities consequent to

We supplement these with other government sources but given the spotty coverage, we prefer to rely on the
daily price data mentioned here.

The cities where the survey was conducted includes Bengaluru (2), Chennai (2), Coimbatore, Delhi (4),
Porvorim (2), Gurgaon (2), Hazaribagh, Indore, Kozhikode, Kumbakonam, Latur, Malappuram, Mumbai,

the lockdown. We are also constrained by the limited set of locations and commodities for which prices
are available.
Overall, we find that post-lockdown, food retail prices faced by consumers that were until then
trending downwards saw a sharp if modest increase in prices; after a brief period of improvement, prices
have been on rise again. Price rise has been particularly pronounced in smaller cities than in the more
populous ones. Pulses, oils and perishables such as tomato and onions, in particular, have seen
significant increases. We also see a marked increase in the gap between retail and wholesale prices,
consistent with the increased transactions costs of retail traders operating during the lockdown. The
spread of prices across locations has also seen a steep rise, likely on account of transport restrictions that
are crucial for integrating markets spatially. While this is likely a temporary phenomenon, these findings
do not portend well for the food security of the urban poor in the short term, especially in the face of
massive unemployment and a steep drop in earnings (Afridi, et al, 2020; NCAER, 2020).
The paper is organized as follows. Following this introduction, in Section 2, we provide an
overview of the food environment in urban India. In section 3, we analyze food prices, elaborating on
the data and methods, before presenting the results. In Section 4, we draw on our survey and other
existing accounts to discuss the operational challenges faced by food retailers and the ways in which
they have attempted to cope with constraints. Section 5 concludes the paper with lessons for the future.
2. Food Environments in urban India
Urban food markets in India constitute a mosaic of actors and tends to be highly fragmented (Reardon,
et al., 2020; Narayanan, 2008). The supermarket revolution, that began in the mid-1990s in southern
India, has since spread across the country. However, despite the robust growth in organized retailing
especially in smaller cities, it continues to serve a limited constituency. There are no reliable estimates
on the composition of the food retailers in India. An industry estimate suggests that as much as 90% of
the food retail market is serviced by small-scale mom-and-pop stores/ corner stores (called kirana) and
other informal players such as push-cart, street vendors; about 8% constitutes modern organized retail
including supermarkets of various formats and 2% online grocery. Other estimates suggest organized
retail is 5% while a recent estimate from industry analysts RedSeer suggests that though the Fast
Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG)/grocery retail market in India is about $450 billon (based on 2016
figures), online retailing is at a nascent stage, accounting for only 0.1% of the total share of the retail
market. The estimate of small-scale corner stores ranges from 6.65 million to 15 million kirana stores.
Notwithstanding the accuracy of these figures, Indian food retail continues to rely on hyperlocal smallscale brick and mortar kirana stores; modern retail penetration is low as is online grocery retail. In
comparison with its south-east Asian neighbours, India’s food and grocery sector continues to depend
highly on small-scale, often unorganized retail sector.

4

The informal retail sector is quite diverse. At one end are itinerant, hand or pushcart vendors
and street side sellers, especially for fresh fruits and vegetables. They are often the last link in a chain of
intermediaries that can comprise as many as five or six intermediaries. Typically, they procure produce
in wholesale markets in the city or from large buyers. They rely on little capital and their margins are
typically thin. They often build a long-term relationships with buyers and rely on a stable clientele
locally. The kirana stores are often run as family enterprises and sell a wide range of products in a small
space. It is not uncommon in these stores to see processed foods made by multinational firms in large
scale plants jostle for space with artisanal foods and snacks prepared by individuals, women’s groups,
and small manufacturers. Many also sell unbranded loose grains, oil, etc. In India, several tech-based
companies have recently built relationships with kirana stores as suppliers of inventory, so that although
kirana stores are not considered modern retail, their back end and operations have become increasingly
sophisticated. Street food is ubiquitous as are informally prepared food delivery services, that are rising
in importance.
Supermarkets and online grocers, at the other end, especially those operating with their own
inventories tend to have sophisticated procurement systems with strong backward linkages (Reardon, et
al., 2020). Supermarkets too operate with different formats (Reardon and Minten, 2010; Narayanan,
2007). The presence of these latter in rural areas and smaller cities continues to be somewhat limited.
There are also strong regional differences across the country in the composition of food retailer and
consumer shopping preferences over different formats.
A lockdown would therefore likely impact the operations of these actors in different ways and their
capacity to adapt to these challenges are likely different as would their strategies for conducting
business, including decisions around sourcing, procurement and pricing. We discuss these in Section 4
and focus on food prices in the following section.

3.

What happened to urban food prices during the lockdown?

3.1. Data and Methods
We use daily price data for 22 commodities collected from 114 Centres by the respective State
Civil Supplies Departments and published by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public
Distribution, Government of India.14 These prices include both retail and wholesale prices for rice,
wheat, wheat flour (atta), edible oils (mustard, groundnut, sesame, coconut, sunflower, Vanaspati,
soyabean and palm), pulses (pigeon pea, split gram, green gram, lentil, black gram), milk, potato, onion
and tomato, sugar, jaggery, iodized salt, loose tea leaves.15
14

For details see https://consumeraffairs.nic.in/price-monitoring-cell/price-monitoring-cell. The data are published
in https://fcainfoweb.nic.in/reports/report_menu_web.aspx.
15
Prices of horticultural commodities are available with the National Horticulture Board, but we do not use these
since the reporting has been spotty during the lockdown period.
5

We construct a Food Price Index using these data. To do this, we first calculate a weighted
average food price for each Centre for each date, drawing on commodity weights used routinely by the
Government of India to compute the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to track inflation. The CPI for Food of
the Government of India however comprises a larger basket of 78 food commodities. The index we
compute includes only a subset of these commodities for which data are publicly available. We
therefore use weights for just the subset, ensuring merely that the weights each commodity gets is in the
same proportion as used in the construction of the official CPI. Once we have Centre-date specific food
price averages, we aggregate this over all the Centres, weighting these by population of these Centres,
as per the Census of India, 2011, to obtain a daily Food Price Index for the country as a whole. We
construct these for retail and wholesale prices so that we have a Retail Food Price Index (RFPI) and
Wholesale Food Price Index (WFPI) respectively.
Both the RFPI and WFPI are robust to alternate weighting systems.16 We also ensure that they
are robust to missing data.17 The data we use are not complete and are not reported for specific
commodities for specific dates. This is in part because the consumption basket itself varies significantly
across cities owing to strong regional preferences and in part due to gaps in reporting. In this analysis
we use all the data available and adjust the weights accordingly to account for missing data. Our index,
the RFPI and WFPI, are different from the standard CPI for Food computed by the Government of India
and as such the two are not directly comparable, both with respect to the method used to compute the
index and in the coverage of the commodities.18
Apart from examining the trends in RFPI and WFPI, we also assess the gap between wholesale
and retail prices. If there are frictions in the market in the transport and delivery of produce to urban
markets, one would expect a larger difference between wholesale and retail prices. The gap would also
increase if retailers choose to charge consumers higher prices, taking advantage of the limited options
consumers might have. Here, we compute Centre-date-Item specific differences between Retail and
Wholesale Prices and aggregate them by first weighting commodities and then applying population
weights to aggregate these over the centres.
We also compare the movement of the RFPI and WFPI across commodities and contrast
patterns across cities. We classify cities into Megacities, Million-plus cities, Class 1 cities/towns and
“small” cities, based on the Census 2011.19 In the narratives of the consequences of the lockdown, focus

The correlation between the Retail CPI index with NSS (quantity), NSS (value) and NSS (State-weights) is
0.9227, 0.9204, and 0.9228 respectively. Similarly, correlation between the Wholesale CPI with NSS (quantity),
NSS (value) and NSS (State-weights) is 0.887, 0.883, and 0.893 respectively.
17
For CPI retail, the correlation is 0.9980 between the pooled and non-missing value indices. Similarly, for CPI
wholesale, the correlation is 0.9943 between the pooled and non-missing value indices.

has been mostly on the large cities, metropolises and little is known about smaller towns and urban
centres. Our goal is to see if these cities have seen similar movements in prices as the large cities.20
Most of the analysis here focuses on a window spanning a few weeks before the lockdown
period until April 21, 2020. As we map the trend in prices during this window, it is useful to bear in
mind the context of food price movements in India. The year 2019, India saw significant food inflation,
especially during the second half of the year. The late 2019s saw onion prices rise significantly
contributing disproportionately to high food inflation. However, since January 2020, overall food
inflation has been on a fairly consistent downward trend. The lockdown thus came at a time when retail
food prices were trending downwards. In general, this has been the trend globally as well, as indicated
by the FAO’s Global Food Price Index (Figure 1). In this context, the dominant sentiment among Indian
policy makers was that food prices are likely to decline further given the economic shock associated
with the lockdown (reported by Suneja and Noronha, 2020, for example). Data released in April
suggests that food inflation for March was 8.76 per cent as against 10.81 per cent in the previous month
leading to a sense that food prices were easing off.21 The lockdown has reversed this trend.

20

We also assess separately states that went in for an early lockdown ahead of the national lockdown. Some states
such as Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh (17 districts) announced a lockdown on March 22, 2020. We do not
find a significant difference however and hence do not present these here.

3.2. Results
Figure 2 plots the Retail and Wholesale Food Price Index. With both RFPI and WFPI, there is a clear
dip around the time of the March 22, 2020, which was the “Janata Curfew”, also a Sunday. The RFPI
however increases immediately after lockdown, reversing a two-month long downward trend in the
RFPI. WFPI too shows a perceptible increase soon after lockdown. The increase after March 24, 2020,
is not apparent in the previous two years, suggesting that this is indeed likely due to the lockdown.22
Towards the end of May, it appears that wholesale prices seem to decline to its pre-lockdown trend,
retail prices are not declining as fast. Figure 3, which maps the price gap between retail and wholesale,
expressed as a percentage of wholesale prices shows a dramatic increase post-lockdown, suggestive of
increased transactions costs for retailers or greater retailer power to set prices or both.
As one would expect, not all commodity prices have increased comparably (Figure 4; Table 1).
All the pulses and most edible oils, sugar and salt register significant increases. The prices of potato and
tomato too have increased significant during the lockdown, although it appears that the increase is not
sustained for tomato. Onion prices have increased although it continues to remain low relative to the
prolonged period of high prices in late 2019. Milk prices however seems to have held, as does loose tea
and palm oil. The government had urged importers to boycott palm oil imports from Malaysia in
February and despite no official ban, imports were curtailed.23 This is reflected in the increase in prices
during February, it has continued to remain at high levels and there is no expectation that imports from
Malaysia will expand any time soon. Price increases are to the tune of over 6% for several pulses, over
3.5% for most edible oils, 15% for potato 28% for tomato (Table 1). For the commodities that have seen
a significant increase, although the prices have plateaued, only a few are reverting to pre-lockdown
level.
Another aspect of food prices is spatial dispersion across cities. Given the restrictions on
transport across and within many states, one would expect that markets are today geographically
segmented. Typically, when there are price differences across two locations, private traders would take
advantage of arbitrage opportunities and move produce to the location with higher prices. This
expansion of supply in markets where price reigns high would occur until the difference reduces to the
extent that there are transport costs. When this mechanism is disrupted, as it has during the lockdown,
one would expect a large difference in prices spatially. This is indeed what has happened post-lockdown
– our estimates show that standard deviation of the RFPI and WFPI across cities increased three times
(from 0.6 to 1.9 and 1.3, on average, respectively between the pre-and post-lockdown period). It is
noteworthy that relative to the RFPI on the eve of the lockdown, the RFPI rise as been has high as 20%
in some centres with others seeing RFPI decline by 5% (Figure 5). The rise in RFPI at rates more than
22

Some states announced lockdowns earlier than March 24, 2020. We do not find any significant difference
between the early and national lockdown states.

15% is disproportionately among small towns and Class 1 cities/towns. We know little about the
specific conditions in these cities, but it is instructive that some cities are seeing a worrying increase in
retail food prices. Much of the media accounts of disruptions in urban food markets have focused on
the largest cities. Yet, we find that smaller cities seem to have more pronounced impacts and register
sharper increase in prices that the average (Figure 6).
These results of a price increase are at odds with many commentaries in India, published during
the lockdown, on the likely direction of food price movements. One key reason is that these predictions
anticipated that demand collapse would suppress prices. While the demand effect (especially the closure
of eateries, restaurants and social events as well as the exodus of migrants) have dominated in some
cities, it appears that supply shocks to food markets have been more powerful in the lockdown period
and have therefore had the opposite effect on prices, on average, and especially pronounced in some

cities. In general, although expectations are that over the medium term, prices likely would go
down, due to lacklustre demand and economic activity, these results suggest that food prices
would rise in the short term, before they fall.

3. Operational challenges and strategies to overcome them
To understand these issues of supply bottlenecks faced by various stakeholders, we conducted three
rounds of face-to-face surveys of around 50 food retailers at 21 locations in 14 cities across India.
They include grocery retailers (kirana stores), retailers of fresh produce, who have temporary stands
or pushcarts on streets, as well as of meat retailers who typically have dedicated stalls where meat is
cut and prepared. The first round of interviews was conducted between April 6-18, 2020 and each
retailer was visited once in this period. A similar exercise was conducted, revisiting the same
respondents as far as possible between May 6-26, 2020 and then again during June 10-July 10, 2020.24
There is clear evidence of significant supply disruptions (Figure 7) relating to both
availability of supplies and transportation. Retailers of fresh produce, typically pushcart or street
vendors seemed to be particularly constrained. In big cities such as Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai,
these vendors mentioned that before the lockdown they sourced their supplies of fresh produce from a
single wholesale market; now they were forced to go to different locations to source different items,
sometimes make multiple trips (3-4) each day to do this. The timings of the wholesale market were
also unpredictable. Vendors in both Mumbai and Delhi reported having to procure produce at 2 a.m.
in the night, rather than early morning as was practice. Another vendor said that often the supplies
were thin and they were often unavailable by the time they could get to the wholesale market. In
Mumbai, retailers of fresh produce said that there was considerable uncertainty as to which wholesale
market in the city would work each day – so that produce would arrive in one area of the city on one
day and another one 20 kms away the next day. These do not seem to have changed much over the
one month between the surveys.
For meats, anecdotal accounts suggest that initially the poultry meat in particular faced a huge
slump because many consumers associated it with the spread of COVID-19.25 Soon after, in some
cities, it had become impossible to procure mutton and chicken. Some vendors reported that chicken
prices, after a collapse, had more than doubled, had gone up from Rs.100/kg to Rs.220/kg within two
weeks in smaller towns, as had mutton prices where they continue to be traded. 26
Transportation costs had increased substantially, doubled in some cities according to our
survey, and was hard to arrange. Grocery retailers mentioned that restocking had become harder.

These interviews were challenging because of movement restrictions during the lockdown and because of
uncertainty around opening times and vendor availability. We kept the interviews short and focused on their
operations. We could revisit only 34 of the same retailers in the second round, with 6 new retailers.

Interestingly, as part of the PIL referred to earlier, the Writ Petition (Civil) No(s). 10894/2020 heard on 15
April 2020, Amit Goyal versus the Union of India, had requested chicken mutton be included in essential food
and drink items. The guidelines issued by the MHA already permits these, but the contention was that police
were harassing the petitioner when he went to sop for meet. The Judge is reported to have asked “what will
happen if we do not eat chicken and mutton for a few days?” while dismissing the petition.

Stocks of branded dry goods had also dwindled as companies were no longer sending refill vans with
their products. A store owner in Latur, Maharashtra, said while demand for biscuits and bakery
products demand had gone up, supply of these had dried up. A few kirana store owners indicated that
due to supply constraints, wholesalers had raised prices of most commodities. Some retailers also
mentioned that they were now stocking fewer items. In the early days of the lockdown, people had
hoarded rice, wheat flour and oils and they felt that there was no demand any longer and had therefore
stopped stocking them. In general, most felt that demand was lower after the initial days. Close to a
third felt overall demand had gone down relative to business as usual. While some said they were
passing on the higher costs they faced on to consumers, others said they were absorbing the losses and
not charging consumers a higher price.
Even as supply was a huge problem, store owners and retail street vendors mentioned that
they were allowed to do business only for limited hours. Most reported that the police ensured that
they closed after 5 or 6 p.m. Retailers of fresh produce found this to be a constraint since their
operating house were usually till 10 p.m.

Even after two months under the lockdown, these

restrictions had not eased and store owners felt that rather than restricting working hours, it would be
easier for them to manage crowds if they were allowed to keep longer hours and do more business.
A disproportionate number of street vendors of fresh produce complained that the police
frequently stopped them and many complained of harassment. Sourcing produce from wholesale
markets in the middle of the night was particularly difficult. Typically, the police demanded a
“moving pass” but these permits were difficult to get and many did not know how to obtain them.27
Other vendors were harassed for either setting up shop or for not ensuring physical distancing
amongst consumers. Street vendors of fresh produce were far more likely to face such harassment
than kirana shop operators, although the kirana shop owners too reported that the police visited
frequently to ensure that the shops were not crowded. By May 2020, while some bottlenecks had
eased, labor shortages, high transportation costs and local restrictions and harassment by police were
identified as key challenges. Supply of fresh produce continued to be a problem (Figure 7).
Street vendors of fresh produce were however adapting to the new situation. Interestingly in
many cities, many migrant workers or those were doing other business have now switched to selling
fruits and vegetables, given the low entry barriers to informal retail vending. In Porvorim, Goa, for
example, a fruit vendor pointed that around 30 people from the locality they are staying in have
opened up fruit shops because they are out of work and could not return to their villages in
neighboring Karnataka. A garage mechanic, forced to shut his shop, had switched to selling fresh
produce.

27

A March 26, 2020 notification of standard operating procedure issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs noted
“In case of unorganized sector, persons engaged in the supply of essential goods may be allowed based on
approval/authorization by the local authorities.” Few street retailers of produces were aware of what was
required.

15

Many who had stalls had now either begun to use pushcarts or had begun to set up temporary
stalls in residential complexes, since consumers could not venture out to shop as much. One vendor in
Hazaribagh, who has been doing business for 30 years, noted that the number of cart vendors of
vegetables and fruits has increased significantly. He felt that in the wholesale market, from where he
sources produce, the number had perhaps gone up five-fold, from 50 pre-lockdown, to 250 postlockdown. He also felt that the new pushcart vendors had captured much of the market share from
“fixed stall” sellers, since they were mobile and consumers were not. In Noida, Uttar Pradesh near the
national capital of New Delhi, one vendor observed that the competition had increased with an
increase in the number of pushcart retailers of fresh produce, observing that this cut into each person’s
earnings. In the smaller cities, some retailers suggested that they were helpless indicating that they
may not be able to continue with so many restrictions in movement and hours of business with
consequently very little sales. Indeed, not all food retailers are able cope. In the smaller cities, some
pushcart retailers suggested that they were considering returning to their native villages.
By May, when we attempted to contact the same retailers, at least six of the pushcart/ street
vendors had stopped selling or had not been doing so regularly on account of difficulties. Of those
interviewed, an overwhelming proportion said that operational challenges continued unabated. In
contrast, grocery store merchants indicated that despite the fact that they continued to pay a high price
for products, things had improved. Over two-thirds of our sample said that they had suffered losses on
account of the lockdown, a fifth said their earnings was less than half. However, this was
disproportionately among street vendors. Among grocery store owners, a fifth mentioned that their
earning had increased significantly, since consumers had to depend on them rather than supermarkets
located in malls, due to closures. E-commerce and online delivery firms too were unable to service all
their consumers leading them to rely on local stores and vendors.
All the retailers seemed to be aware of Covid-19 and virtually all of them, barring two, stated
that they were taking precautions to ensure physical distancing. Most store owners were now serving
customers at the door step, forbidding entry into the store. Those that did allowed one person or a few,
depending on the size, into the store at a time. Some kirana stores mentioned that they were only
allowing customers who came with a specific list who could place their order quickly in order to be
able to service more clients. Those who were undecided and scanned the shop to see what they
wanted were discouraged. Many pushcart and street side fresh produce vendors kept their produce
covered.
As part of the survey we also collected prices of key items. Table 2 presents these prices and
compares these to prices from the government data for the same time period April 6-18, 2020.28
Consistently, it is evident that for most commodities, the prices collected as part of the survey tend to
28

For horticultural commodities, we compare the prices with the National Horticulture Board prices, though
these were available only for one centre Badaun in Uttar Pradesh; we therefore use prices from a commercial
website. These come with caveats on data reliability since it is unclear how these prices have been collected.

be higher and show a larger range than the average retail prices for the country. This offers a modest
confirmation of official prices, while suggesting that price rise might be greater than official data
suggest (Table 2). At the same time, for the cities we survey, average prices for most commodities,
particularly fresh produce had dropped over the month between the surveys.

The narratives from our survey of urban food retailers is consistent with reports on
operational challenges in food retail published in credible newspapers across the country. Although
the central government clarified on March 29, 2020 and issued an order indicating that grocery stores
could remain open throughout the day or night, our survey suggests that on the ground not much
appears to have changed, an issue that the Government of India itself seemed to be aware of. On
April 3, 2020, the Government of India was even pushed to ponder the meaning of food and grocery:
Queries have been received as to what constitutes food and grocery. Since it is neither
feasible nor desirable to mention each item of food and grocery in the guidelines, the
State/UT Governments have been advised to interpret these terms to mean all items of
food and grocery that are usually consumed by people on day to day basis.

Several instances of social discrimination have emerged recently in many cities, where
pushcart retailers of fresh produce who are from minority religion have been denied access to
neighborhoods where they typically sold produce.29 In our follow up survey, for example, about six of
those interviewed mentioned that they had experienced some form of discrimination. One pushcart
vendor from our survey noted that his customers from one religious group had switched to another
seller, citing his religion as a factor. There have also been instances where supermarket retailers have
refused to allow entry to customers from specific ethnic backgrounds.30 These disturbing instances
reflect systemic discrimination and deserve further scrutiny and documentation.
In response to the formidable challenges associated with food retail during the lockdown,
several new initiatives have emerged. For example, many farmers, braving the lockdown, have taken
to delivering produce directly using WhatsApp to secure aggregated orders in housing societies.31
Other farmers chose to travel to the cities to set up shop at roadsides. Consumer-led Groups on
Twitter, Facebook and What’s App such as Harvest Farmer Initiative (HFI) and Farmer to Fork have
emerged specifically to address farmer distress. The former lists on Twitter details of farmers who are
in distress along with the produce they wish to sell so that consumers can arrange to procure directly
from farmers. The latter aggregates consumer demand via Facebook to source from farmers. Alumni
of the University of Agricultural Sciences in Bangalore similarly set up a platform to assist grape
farmers in getting produce to the city.32 Several other not-for profit and for-profit agritech platforms
such as Krishihub, Agrostar, Ninjakart and Jumbotail (Thaker, 2020) have performed a critical role in

restoring the broken links of the food supply chain. Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) too have
taken the lead in aggregating produce of members to supply to clients in cities and small towns (Vrutti
& Arya, 2020). In some southern states, governments have been actively procuring horticultural
produce from FPOs for distribution including home delivery. E-delivery services like Swiggy,
Zomato, that typically delivered food from restaurants, have pivoted to delivering groceries and many
local informal dairies, restaurants and sweetshops began supplying groceries and fresh produce via
these platforms.33 Several online retail platforms tied up with the local corner stores to deliver
essentials.34 Furthermore, to facilitate the delivery to food (both grocery and cooked) during the
lockdown, these online platforms allowed customers to make personalized orders from any store of
their convenience for a very small fee.35 These examples, though likely small in scale and limited in
reach, suggest a capacity for innovation and resilience in response to severe disruptions associated
with the lockdown.36
Many recent accounts of Indian food retail note the emergence of large-scale online grocery
and produce delivery establishments. During the lockdown, several of them had been forced to
suspend operations, in part because their delivery agents encountered problems with local police but
also because with the large-scale migration out of cities, many found it hard to recruit delivery staff.
In general, larger online grocery retailers had resumed operations, by the end of the lockdown,
expanding their workforce by hiring workers from other sectors, but were struggling to match
consumer demand.37 Industry observers suggest that while online food delivery orders (referred to as
“foodtech”) dropped by 75% in April 2020, relative to January 2020 (e-commerce fell by 83% over
this period), e-grocery in contrast rose by 27%.38 Despite sophisticated procurement and stocking
systems, this segment were unable to function effectively (Mahajan and Tomar, 2020, for example)
and only a fraction of the orders were fulfilled due to distribution challenges, including labor
availability. By contrast, most note the resilience of the kirana store and informal street retailers.39

Concluding remarks

Discussions on the critical trade-offs between controlling the pandemic and economic distress
associated with measures such as lockdowns have drawn a lot of attention recently (Ray et al., 2020).
Most suggest that there is a need to manage both and that these should not be viewed as one or the
other or as a commentator put it as a “Faustian bargain”. The lockdown clearly left urban food
markets in disarray. Despite guidelines that allow the movement and transactions in essential
commodities, it appears that law enforcement and the bureaucracy have privileged maintaining the
lockdown over maintaining food security, which has been compromised severely. Surveys during the
lockdown suggest that of the 11,159 workers surveyed by a migrant support network, an estimated
96% did not get rations from the government, 72% said that their rations will get over in 2 days and
90% did not get wages (SWAN 2020). While the entire country was under a lockdown, those in
urban areas were likely more vulnerable than those in rural areas. A survey by NCAER shows that
while 57% of the respondents in urban areas reported that the lockdown caused a large dip in their
income sources, only 48% of individuals in urban areas had access to any social security, in terms of
additional grains or cash, in comparison to 66% individuals in the rural areas (NCAER, 2020). The
loss of income coupled with lower availability of safety nets in the urban areas adds to the growing
concerns that these areas may be disproportionately affected due to COVID-19, especially as urban
are more likely to be classified as “containment zones”-thereby restricting most movement and
income earning opportunities (NCAER, 2020). Yet, urban food systems in India have shown some
resilience thus far.
There are several key lessons from the impacts of the lockdown. Macroeconomists in Indian
focused heavily on the prospect of recessionary trends that will depress prices in general, including
food prices in the early days of the lockdown. The Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy
Committee report noted that even for those prices that have been high, such as for pulses “the shock
to demand from COVID-19 may weaken (prices) going forward.” Yet, our analysis suggests that in
the near term, supply shocks more than counterbalance the collapse of demand leading to increase in
food prices in many urban contexts. This suggests that notwithstanding longer-term trends,
macroeconomists need factor into their policy proposals the possibility of short term and localized
inflation. In general, such price rise justifies a sharp focus on emergency measures that expand food
availability and feeding arrangements for a sustained period whenever processing and transportation
bottlenecks surface.
Second, existing research on urban food systems in India note the complex mosaic of actors
involved and the high degree of informality. Street vendors/retailers of food have always been

21

marginalized, politically and economically (See Bhowmik, 2005, for example).40 Our field survey and
anecdotal evidence suggest considerable resilience of informal vendors who have been adapting in
response to severe constraints, despite their vulnerability. It is imperative that the government allows
them freedom to operate and for law enforcers explicitly facilitate their functioning as the pandemic
continues to unfold, but even beyond. At the time of writing, it is unclear how many have survived
the lockdown period and will return to doing business. On the other hand, there have been many
innovations in food supply chains at the producer end, especially in terms of collective efforts to get
produce directly to customers. Perhaps this is an opportunity to consider collective retailing as well,
bringing together informal street retailers, considering the critical role they play in maintaining the
urban food system.
Third, it is important for the government to ensure that basic food processing industries, such
as pulse mills, flour and sugar mills, crushing units and solvent extractors who produce edible oil are
able to resume functioning with financial support where needed and to ensure the safety of workers in
these industries.41 Many of these are small units that operate locally and would help ensure that
supplies are available in the smaller cities and towns as well. It is possible that some of them,
especially small-scale units, are financially vulnerable and may have difficulty continuing operations,
especially with labor shortages. The revival of these units needs to be prioritized. The pandemic has
generated calls for a decentralization of agrifood supply chains. These are likely already the case in
India. Yet, India’s experience during the lockdown suggest they too can be vulnerable to shocks.
As for government policies at times like this, many cities have tried to enforce price
controls.42 It might be better focus on removing the supply chain bottlenecks and supporting supply
chain actors rather than attempt to enforce a cap on prices, which puts disproportionate power in the
hands of local law enforcement.43 This can include local governments and government-supported
cooperatives to retail food at controlled prices. Enhancing supply is key to ensuring prices do not soar
and would additionally minimize the impact of overzealous law enforcement. Even in the best of
times, food prices in urban India put healthy diets largely out of reach for a majority of the urban poor
(Raghunathan, et al., 2019). At this time, relief has been patchy at best. It is likely that even when

40

There is a long history of struggle for the rights of these key players in the economy. A Supreme Court
Judgement on September 9, 2013 and the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street
Vending) Act, 2014 emerged from these struggles. National Association of Street Vendors in India (NASVI)
and the National Hawker Federation are two prominent organisations in this area.
41
Notifications on April 12 and April 21, 2020 permit these flour mills, etc. to operate in urban areas with
appropriate measures for distancing. A recent estimate suggests that of 133 firms in the processed foods
industry as per the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIE) Prowess database, 86 of these are
deemed to be “liquidity vulnerable” firms, i.e., these have liquid assets cover for less than 90 days on minimum
expenses (Sane and Sharma, 2020).
42
On April 7, 2020, the Government of India issued a notification urging states to invoke the Essential
Commodities Act, to tackle hoarding, black marketing, profiteering and speculative trading as interventions to
prevent a rise in prices.

food prices recover the large number of workers who will continue to be out of work would need
access to food and cash to help them tide over the crisis (Khera, 2020; Afridi, et al., 2020).
While short- and medium-term response is critical to stave off hunger in urban areas, the
larger question is whether the innovations in food supply chains that have emerged in response to the
crisis survive and how can these novel institutions be strengthened to aid the resilience of urban food
systems. These questions will need scrutiny once the pandemic is over.
