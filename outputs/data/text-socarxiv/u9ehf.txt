INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the economic and political landscape of the world (Blofield
et al., 2020; Greer et al., 2020). Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have been particularly
vulnerable to the effects of the disease (Breevoort et al., 2020; Dahab et al., 2020; Elhadi et al., 2020;
Loayza and Pennings, 2020). Yet, LMIC regions have different approaches to disease response,
control and monitoring. For instance, while Africa centralizes these roles in the Africa Centers for
Disease Control (Africa CDC) (Wadvalla, 2020), Latin American countries lack a common health
administration, making them more susceptible to complications due to poverty, comorbidity and
political dynamics (Pablos-Mendez et al., 2020).
Traditional and social media have been important to disseminate information related to disease
containment and treatment (Basch et al., 2020; Hopman et al., 2020). Yet, these tools have
also served to spread misinformation, conspiracy theories and “miracle cures” for COVID-19
(Malinverni and Brigagão, 2020; Moreno-Castro et al., 2020; Oliveira et al., 2020; Pereira et al.,
2020). In Latin America, there are several instances in which media trends have shaped policy
and resulted in dangerous interventions to fight the pandemic (Oliveira et al., 2020). These have
included the administration of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin (Mega, 2020), as well as the use
of untested convalescent plasma as therapy for COVID-19 (Ferreira and Mostajo-Radji, 2020).
While the world was horrified by President Donald Trump’s suggestion of drinking household
disinfectants to prevent COVID-19 (Litman et al., 2020), less has been mentioned about the
extensive use of chlorine dioxide as treatment in Latin America. Chlorine dioxide is a disinfectant
commonly used to clean medical equipment and treat residual waters (Smith et al., 2001). At high
concentrations and non-physiological pH, chlorine dioxide effectively inhibits microbial and viral
activity (Hauchman et al., 1986; Zoffoli et al., 2005). Exposure to high doses of chlorine dioxide has
been shown to cause thyroid suppression, DNA damage and neurotoxicity in several animal models
(Bercz et al., 1982; Abdel-Rahman et al., 1984; Orme et al., 1985; Harrington et al., 1986; Toth et al.,
1990). It is therefore understood that chlorine dioxide is not safe for human consumption.
At the global scale, the dissemination of pseudoscience and post-truth phenomena is often
associated with income inequalities (Rijs and Fenter, 2020). Interestingly, however, while Latin
American countries often have similar levels of inequality, the use of chlorine dioxide as
COVID-19 treatment varied significantly across countries (Table 1). In this article, I use chlorine
dioxide consumption to further dissect the contribution of additional variables to pseudoscience
dissemination, including scientific literacy and the democratic state of internal politics.

BRIEF HISTORY OF CHLORINE DIOXIDE
AND ITS USE IN MEDICINE

Some of the common symptoms of intoxication include severe
vomiting and diarrhea, anemia, severe liver failure, low blood
pressure, arrythmia and methemoglobinemia (US Food and
Drug Administration, 2020).
During the COVID-19 pandemic, proponents of chlorine
dioxide resurfaced, claiming that this compound could prevent
and treat SARS-CoV-2 infections (Karnik-Henry, 2020). While
no evidence was presented to support those claims, one
observational clinical trial was registered in clinicaltrials.gov
which aimed to determine the effectiveness of oral chlorine
dioxide administration to treat COVID-19 in 20 volunteers. This
study, which was to take place in Colombia, was sponsored by the
Genesis Foundation. Yet, to date, no results have been reported
(US National Library of Medicine, 2020).

Chlorine dioxide is obtained by the chemical reaction of sodium
chlorite with an acid (Burela et al., 2020; Galloso, 2020). In
his book “Master Mineral Solution of the 3rd Millennium,”
Jim Humble claims that he stumbled upon chlorine dioxide
as a miracle solution to malaria when four members of his
camp came down with the disease in Guyana (Humble, 2011).
He then refined his formula through trial-and-error testing in
Latin America and Africa (Humble, 2011). Since then, the use
of chlorine dioxide has been promoted as a cure for cancer,
HIV, hepatitis, malaria, H1N1, Ebola, acne, autism and other
disorders (Humble, 2011; Harrison and Zane, 2017). The major
proponent of this compound as a medication is the “Genesis
II Church of Health and Healing,” of which Humble is one of
the founders (Harrison and Zane, 2017). Self-defined as a “nonreligious church,” this organization considers chlorine dioxide to
be a sacrament that is administered in exchange for donations
(Braga, 2020).
There are several documented cases, both in the scientific
literature and in the popular media, of strong side effects caused
by chlorine dioxide intoxication (Montoya and Rocha, 2020).
According to court documents, in the United States alone,
poison control centers have handled over 16,000 cases of chlorine
dioxide intoxication since 2014 (Braga, 2020; Orshan, 2020).

USE OF CHLORINE DIOXIDE FOR
COVID-19 PREVENTION AND TREATMENT
IN LATIN AMERICA
In Latin America, the biggest proponent of chlorine dioxide is
the “Coalicion Mundial Salud y Vida” (translated to “Global
Health and Life Coalition” - COMUSAV). Created in 2020,
this coalition has over 3,500 members and chapters in 16 Latin
American countries, although it is not formally registered in any
country (Gonzalez, 2020). COMUSAV defines itself as a coalition

which were from MAS, did not resign. In the mist of the
presidential elections, MAS-dominated PLA approved a bill
to “exceptionally elaborate, commercialize and supply chlorine
dioxide for COVID-19” (Porter and Moynihan, 2020; Trigo et al.,
2020). While President Añez never signed the bill to legalize the
use of chlorine dioxide as a drug (King, 2020), several governors,
majors and political candidates, most of which were from MAS,
distributed this compound in their respective regions (Associated
Press, 2020).

that encompasses “open-minded” physicians, researchers,
health professionals and enthusiasts promoting integral health
approaches and homeopathic practices (Lammoglia, 2020).
The leaders of COMUSAV are practicing physicians who treat
thousands of patients with chlorine dioxide (Gonzalez, 2020).
Several of its members have been outspoken at promoting
unproven therapies, such as the use of scorpion venom to treat
cancer (Musacchio, 2020), as well as rejecting the application
of vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Molina, 2020).
COMUSAV claims to have done chlorine dioxide toxicology
studies in chicken embryos infected with avian coronavirus,
although those results have not been published in a peerreviewed journal (La Red, 2020). Moreover, COMUSAV falsely
claimed that these results demonstrate chlorine dioxide is safe
to administer to other animals, including humans and that
the results are extrapolatable to other coronaviruses, such as
SARS-CoV-2 (La Red, 2020).
Many Latin American countries debated the use of chlorine
dioxide to treat COVID-19. For example, in Peru congressman
and physician Posemoscrowte Chagua requested the congress
to create a “neutral” special commission to evaluate the effects
of chlorine dioxide in the treatment of COVID-19 (Redaccion
Gestion, 2020). The health commission of the congress evaluated
the proposal and proponents of chlorine dioxide were invited
to present their viewpoints to lawmakers (Loayza, 2020). The
commission eventually suspended the investigation and did
not approve the use of chlorine dioxide in Peru (El Universo,
2020). In Argentina, congresswoman Monica Frade requested
the central government to authorize the chlorine dioxide as a
medication, although the request was unsuccessful and the topic
was not further discussed in congress (El Intransigente, 2020). In
Chile, congressman Florcita Alarcon presented a similar request
(Dote, 2020), which was also rejected (Camara de Diputados
de Chile, 2020). In Costa Rica, the main proponent was former
presidential candidate Rolando Araya who claimed he “didn’t
need to be a doctor to know it works” (Roque, 2020). While
these motions were particularly effective at promoting the public
image of specific political figures, they failed to gain formal
authorization to commercialize chlorine dioxide as a medication.
However, this compound was extensively sold in illegal markets
and promoted in social media (Oliveira et al., 2020).
Within Latin America, Bolivia represents a particularly
interesting case, as it is the only country in which congress
approved the use of chlorine dioxide in the prevention and
treatment of COVID-19 (Porter and Moynihan, 2020; Trigo
et al., 2020). Bolivia has a complicated political landscape. Until
November 2019, President Evo Morales and his political party
“Movimiento al Socialismo”(translates to “Movement toward
socialism” —MAS) governed the country for almost 14 years.
Yet, after the Organization for American States (OAS) found
indictments of fraud in the October 2019 presidential elections,
Morales and his closest allies resigned and fled the country
amid massive protests and loss of support from the police
and the armed forces (Escobari and Hoover, 2019). Through
constitutional succession, Jeanine Añez assumed the interim
presidency of Bolivia (Sohr, 2019). However, the members
“Plurinational legislative assembly” (PLA), the majority of

THE REASONS BEHIND CHLORINE
DIOXIDE CONSUMPTION IN LATIN
AMERICA
When trying to pinpoint the reason behind the spread of
pseudoscience and misinformation in the context of COVID19, science advisors and epidemiologists have focused on income
inequality as an important measurement (Rijs and Fenter, 2020).
Indeed, one survey of over 20,000 scientists has shown a strong
correlation between governmental acceptance of science advise
and the Gini Index (GI), a standard measurement of a country’s
income inequality (Rijs and Fenter, 2020; Ward, 2020). Yet, on
several occasions the GI has not been accurate at measuring
phenomena between different Latin American countries, due to
the large informal sector of the economy and the fact that most
Latin American countries score similarly in this index (Dobson
and Ramlogan-Dobson, 2010; Hartmann et al., 2016) (Table 1).
Not surprisingly, when comparing the GI to the penetrance of
chlorine dioxide consumption in the population (as measured
by news and blog articles), there is no obvious correlation
(Figure 1A).
Previously, the Global Innovation Index (GII) has been
used to assess the degree of science literacy in a population
(Filho and Heerdt, 2018; Ferreira et al., 2019). GI and GII are
unrelated, as countries like the United States and China with
a relatively unequal societies, rank high in GII, due to their
strong science agencies and research facilities. Latin American
countries, on the other hand, consistently rank among the worst
performers in this index (Crespo and Crespo, 2016; Ferreira
et al., 2019). Science literacy and education are anticorrelated to
pseudoscientific beliefs in the population (Carosso et al., 2019).
As result, when comparing chlorine dioxide consumption in
individual Latin American countries to their performance in the
GII it becomes evident that poorly GII performing countries had
a high penetrance of chlorine dioxide consumption (Figure 1B).
Recently, the degree of freedom of speech and democracy,
as measured by the Freedom in the World Index (FWI),
has been used to better understand the COVID-19 response
of individual governments, particularly in reporting case
numbers and death tolls (Hussein et al., 2020). Unlike in the
GI and GII, Latin American countries have very different
degrees of FWI, with some countries considered “Free”
such as Chile, while others considered “Not Free” like Cuba
and Venezuela (Santiago et al., 2020). Of note, populist
governments tend to score low in the FWI (Waisbord,
2018) and pseudoscientific beliefs are often seen in cultures

Chlorine Dioxide Consumption During COVID-19

FIGURE 1 | Chlorine dioxide consumption in Latin America. Latin American countries had different degrees of chlorine dioxide consumption during the COVID-19
pandemic and are classified as “low,” “medium,” or “high” according to the number of media articles and blog posts related to this chemical as a potential COVID-19
treatment. Comparison to (A) Gini Index, (B) Global Innovation Index, and (C) Freedom in the World Index. Red dot represents Bolivia, as the only country in which
chlorine dioxide was approved by congress as a COVID-19 treatment. For raw values, refer to Table 1.

and regions with low freedom of speech (Anthony, 1999).
Interestingly, there was minimal chlorine dioxide consumption
in countries that scored high in the FWI, while low scoring
countries showed the highest consumption (Figure 1C).
Together, one can only conclude low science literacy and
low freedom of speech, and not income inequality, were
determinant in the pseudoscientific belief that chlorine
dioxide could be consumed for the prevention and treatment
of COVID-19.

officials and science diplomats (Associated Press, 2020; Awandare
et al., 2020; Barber and Mostajo-Radji, 2020). This strategy
became most effective in countries with low scientific literacy
(Figure 1).
Anxiety and desperation have been extensively observed
throughout the world during the COVID-19 pandemic (Ornell
et al., 2020). These feelings have been accompanied with an
increase in the search of homeopathic solutions to overcome
the disease, particularly in regions with weak and saturated
healthcare systems that have undergone strict lockdowns (EscolaGascon et al., 2020; Espin, 2020; Vega-Dienstmaier, 2020).
Several governmental global leaders have taken advantage of this
phenomenon in order to promoter their personal image (Parmet
and Paul, 2020), specially during elections periods.
As we approach a time period in which massive vaccinations
against the SARS-CoV-2 virus will be needed, understanding the
roots, as well as the causes of dissemination, and politicization of
scientific misinformation will be key to overcome this pandemic.

DISCUSSION
COVID-19 has often been described as the first posttruth pandemic (Parmet and Paul, 2020; Shelton, 2020).
Several studies have identified sources of this phenomenon,
including contradicting information in social media, failure
of governmental officials to accurately predict the spread of
the disease, mistrust in the WHO, and increased economic
inequalities (Parmet and Paul, 2020; Puri et al., 2020).
In the times of crises, scientists are key figures to serve as
advisors to governments and common citizens (Awandare et al.,
2020). Unlike popular media, which depicts messages based
in emotions, evidence-based science communication is factual,
therefore reducing fear and uncertainty (Szczuka et al., 2020). In
Latin America, the communication strategy of chlorine dioxide
proponents followed an approach in which pseudoscientists
were presented as experts in the media, whose messages were
considered equal to those of epidemiologists, public health
