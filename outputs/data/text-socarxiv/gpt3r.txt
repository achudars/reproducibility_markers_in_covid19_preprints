Abstract
There is growing evidence that exposure to the natural world (blue-green spaces) has potential
benefits for mental health and well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures adopted to
control it provide a natural experiment to investigate the links between nature exposure and mental
health under extreme conditions. Using a survey distributed online and based on 6,080 responses,
we tested three hypotheses: (1) people will show different levels of symptoms of depression and
anxiety depending on the level of lockdown (severity) and ability to maintain contact with outdoor
spaces; and (2) where access to outdoor public spaces was restricted, those with access to private
outdoor spaces (2a) or even a green-blue nature view (2b) will show fewer symptoms of depression
and anxiety and a more positive mood. Lockdown severity significantly affected mental health, while
contact with nature helped people to cope with these impacts. The buffering effect of nature was
especially relevant for those under strict lockdowns. People perceived that nature helped them to
cope with lockdown measures; and emotions were more positive among individuals with accessible
outdoor spaces and blue-green elements in their views. These findings can help decision-makers
in developing potential future lockdown measures to mitigate the negative impacts, helping people
to be more resilient and maintain better mental health.

Introduction
In December 2019, a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and associated disease (COVID-19) were
identified in China, and quickly spread to the rest of the world (1). This led to a rapid increase of
infections and deaths, which jeopardized the capacity of public health systems all over the world1
and governments took measures to contain the disease.
These measures have been highly variable among countries but the most common were
border and school closures, teleworking, and, particularly, measures restricting the movement of
people, including so called “lockdowns” (2, 3). In Europe, the first country to enact a national
lockdown was Italy (11th March), followed by Spain (15th March), France (17th March), Germany
(22nd March), and the United Kingdom (23rd March). The stringency of the implemented measures
varied among countries. The three major approaches were: Level 1- people were not allowed to
leave their homes except for activities such as essential jobs, buying food and medicines,
emergencies or walking the dog (e.g. China, Italy or Spain); Level 2- severe lockdown but with
certain time for outdoor exercise (e.g. France, United Kingdom); and Level 3- the limitation of
movements as recommendations rather than binding rules (e.g. Scandinavian countries).
The implementation of physical distancing and lockdowns are likely responsible for having
saved millions of lives; with estimates of >3 million lives saved in 11 European countries alone (4).
However, these interventions are likely to have led to many unintended consequences and the
COVID-19 pandemic has provided a natural experiment. Thus, parallel to the fast-moving medical
research to find effective treatments and a vaccine, studies on how the pandemic and the
subsequent lockdown measures are impacting the environment (5, 6), the economy (7) and
people´s mental health (8–10) have also been conducted.
Central to COVID-19 restrictions in most countries has been physical distancing and even
“self-isolation” or “quarantine” from others. There is very strong evidence suggesting that isolation
from others can damage mental health (11–13). Thus, it is not surprising that symptoms of
depression and anxiety (already some of the most common mental health disorders) (14), have
increased in the early stages of lockdown (15, 16). However, there is also emerging evidence that
individual´s psychological resilience can help to cope and adapt to adverse circumstances (17, 18).
Also, that contact with nature can buffer or mitigate against the negative effects of social isolation
on mental health (19, 20), an effect that may have been especially important during lockdown (21).
Indeed, there is a growing literature showing that exposure to blue-green spaces (e.g.
urban parks, woodlands, rivers and the coast), has a range of potential benefits for mental health
and well-being (22–26), also referred to as cultural ecosystems services (27). Exposure can come
in three ways: direct contact, e.g. deliberately visiting a park for recreation; indirect contact, e.g.
window views of natural spaces; and incidental contact e.g. passing through a park when
commuting to work (28). To date the strongest evidence in support of mental health benefits has
been for direct contact in natural settings, with benefits to general (29, 30) and clinical (31, 32)
populations. A large UK study with over 20,000 people estimated two hours/week outdoors in bluegreen spaces as a critical threshold, below which well-being decreases significantly (33). But
indirect contact, by having a window view of nature, and especially blue spaces, has also been
found to be positively associated with better mental health, even once socio-economic factors have
been taken into account (34–36). Importantly for the COVID-19 crisis, research also suggests that
maintaining contact with nature during stressful life events, such as relationship breakdown or job
loss, can “buffer” individuals against stress; with those living in greener areas reporting fewer
mental and physical symptoms of poor-health during, and shortly after, the stressful event (37).

Under the probable scenario of a second wave of COVID-19 (38, 39) and/or spread of new
emerging diseases in the near future, we need to understand the specific factors that positively
contributed to mental health during lockdown, so measures/strategies can be better designed in
future.
The aim of the current study was to test whether, during the first wave of the COVID-19
outbreak, people who maintained direct and/or indirect contact with outdoor spaces coped better
with lockdown measures in terms of fewer symptoms of poor mental health (i.e. depression and
anxiety) and better maintenance of positive mood. To achieve this aim, an online self-report survey
was distributed between April-May 2020, to people around the world and under different lockdown
scenarios.
We tested the following three hypotheses: 1) People will show different levels of symptoms
of depression and anxiety depending on the level of lockdown and whether they were able to
maintain contact with public outdoor nature spaces; 2) Where access to public outdoor nature
spaces was restricted, those with access to outdoor spaces such as a garden or balcony (2a) or
even a green/blue nature view (2b) will show fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety, and a
more positive mood.
Results
A total of 6,895 responses were received from the online survey, with a usable sample of 6,080
responses, after the application of filters (Supplementary Information (SI) Figure S1). We obtained
responses from 77 countries, with the highest representation corresponding to the European
countries of Spain (n = 3,704 participants; 61%), United Kingdom (n = 451; 7.4%) and Germany (n
= 324; 5.3%).
All 6,080 participants were used to test the first Hypothesis. The subsample of respondents
from Spain in severe lockdown (Level 1) (n = 3,403; 56.0%) was used to test Hypothesis 2. This
Spanish subsample was selected as in countries with less strict lockdown measures (levels 2 and
3), the effects on mental health of residence characteristics, and more precisely, the effect of
accessibility to outdoor spaces and nature views from home, could be biased by a more freely
available access to nature and public outdoor spaces for recreational reasons. Furthermore, the
high representation of Spain in the total sample allowed for a more in-depth analysis. The socioeconomic characteristics of the sample and subsample are summarized in SI Table S1.
Lockdown severity positively associated with poor mental health. Mental health was assessed
using the 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) screening scale, composed by the 2-item
PHQ-2 for depression and the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2) for anxiety.
Supporting our first hypothesis, people who were in Level 1 countries reported more symptoms of
depression (Chi-squared X2(2)=27.501; p<0.001) and anxiety (Chi-squared X2(2)=10.234;
p=0.006), and greater signs of poor mental health overall (Kruskal Wallis H(2)=56.025; p<0.001;
(Table 1). Specifically, the proportion of people who reported symptoms considered indicative of
being at risk of depression, i.e. scores of ≥3 on the PHQ-2 scale, were 25.4% for Level 1 vs. 19.1%
and 20.4% in Levels 2 and 3, respectively. The pattern for anxiety (GAD-2 scores ≥3) was similar:
Level 1, 28.8%; Level 2, 26.4%; and Level 3, 23.6%). In terms of the overall PHQ-4 scale 23.7% of
respondents in Level 1 reported ‘Moderate’ or ‘Severe’ symptoms of poor mental health vs. 17.6%
in Level 2 and 18.3% in Level 3. For the PHQ-2 and PHQ-4 scales, post-hoc tests confirmed that
people in Level 1 were significantly more likely to have symptoms of mental health issues than
people in less strict lockdowns (Levels 2 and 3) (Table 1). Regarding GAD-2 for anxiety screening,

3

there was a higher percentage of individuals at risk in Level 1 than in Levels 2-3, but the differences
were only significant between Level 1 and 3 (Table 1).
To explore if, in addition to lockdown levels, other factors may have determined the
prevalence of depression and anxiety, logistic Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) were developed,
using the PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scale results as dependent variables. The models were built with three
independent variables: level of lockdown (Levels 1, 2, 3), access to outdoor spaces (yes, no), and
natural elements in views from home (yes, no). The unadjusted models (Table 2) supported
hypothesis 1, less strict lockdown levels, greater access to private outdoor spaces, and nature
views from home, were all associated with lower symptoms of depression and anxiety. The
inclusion of socioeconomic variables (adjusted models, Table 2), did not alter the general pattern.
Several residence characteristics were predictors of symptoms of both depression and
anxiety (Table 2). Having greater home space (i.e. rooms per individuals under lockdown),
accessible private outdoor areas, and nature views were all associated with significantly lower odds
of depression and anxiety symptoms. The more psychologically-resilient the individual (measured
with the Brief Resilience Coping Scale BRCS), the lower the odds for depression (OR = 0.83; 95%
CI 0.81-0.85; p < 0.001) and anxiety (OR = 0.88; 95% CI 0.86-0.90; p < 0.001). Regarding
socioeconomic characteristics, women, younger adults, and pet owners were more likely to show
symptoms of depression and anxiety than men, older people and people who did not own a pet.
Other variables specifically affected either depression or anxiety symptoms; e.g. people who
changed their employment status during COVID-19 (regardless of the type of change) were more
likely to show symptoms of depression than respondents whose employment status did not change,
but the effect was not significant for anxiety. On the other hand, spending the lockdown with people
with special care needs was linked to higher odds for anxiety, while the effect for depression was
not significant.
In the GLMs built with people in Level 1 (adjusted models, Table 2), the effect of
accessibility to outdoor spaces and nature views was significant and strongly positive for reducing
the likelihood of exhibiting symptoms of depression (access to outdoors OR=0.67; 95% CI 0.570.80; p<0.001; and nature views OR=0.77; 95% CI 0.65-0.92; p < 0.01) and anxiety (access to
outdoors OR=0.77; 95% CI 0.66-0.90; p<0.01; nature views OR=0.78; 95% CI 0.67-0.91; p<0.01).
However, for GLMS built with individuals in Levels 2-3, only nature views had a positive effect in
depression (OR = 0.77; 95% CI 0.61-0.97; p<0.05).
Nature contact ‘buffers’ effect of lockdown on mental health. Supporting Hypothesis 2, when
lockdown measures included strict restrictions to access outdoor public spaces (i.e. people in Spain
under lockdown Level 1), individuals who had direct access to outdoor spaces from their residence
(e.g. balcony, garden) and individuals with mixed or natural views from the window (e.g. green/blue
spaces) showed lower symptoms of depression and anxiety than individuals with no access to
outdoor spaces and with limited or urban views (Table 3). The type of accessible outdoor space
and type of view were related to the likelihood of exhibiting symptoms of mental disorders (for PHQ4 values vs. type of outdoor space or vs. type of view, Kruskal Wallis Tests p<0.001; for PHQ-2
and GAD-2 values vs. type of outdoor spaces or vs. type of view, all chi-squared tests p<0.001).
Post hoc tests confirmed that people with no accessible outdoor spaces had higher odds of
clinically important symptoms of depression (PHQ-2 post hoc test p<0.05) and overall mental health
(PHQ-4 post hoc Dunn´s Test p<0.05) than people with any of the three kinds of accessible outdoor
spaces (balcony, other private spaces [e.g. private garden], shared or public spaces). Individuals
with no nature elements in their views (i.e. limited or urban views) had higher odds of clinically
important symptoms of depression (PHQ-2 post hoc tests p<0.05) and higher PHQ-4 scores
(Dunn´s Test p<0.05) than individuals with mixed or natural views. Regarding anxiety (GAD-2),
results suggest that people were more likely to be ≥3 threshold when they did not have accessible
outdoor spaces and when they had limited or urban views. However, for GAD-2 values, the post
hoc test results were not conclusive, neither for outdoor spaces (none vs. shared or public spaces,

4

p<0.05) nor for views (limited or urban views vs. natural views, p<0.05). Regression models
confirmed the overall importance of the type of outdoor spaces and the type of views for the
likelihood of showing symptoms of depression and anxiety (SI Table S2). However, in the adjusted
models for depression, the effect of nature views shifted to p<0.05, indicating that no clear positive
effect was found in this type of view over the reference level “limited or urban views”.
People perceived that nature helped them to cope better with lockdown measures. In
connection with hypothesis 2, respondents in strict lockdown not only showed lower odds of
symptoms of depression and anxiety depending on the type of accessible outdoor space and view,
but also perceived the positive effect that those spaces and views had in their ability to cope with
lockdown restrictions. The self-reported contribution of accessible outdoor spaces (Table 4) was
more positive for people with access to a private space (e.g. garden, swimming pool)
(M=4.50±0.94) than for people with access to a balcony (M=4.15±1.02) and people with access to
shared or public outdoor spaces (M=4.27±1.14). The differences were significant after the ANOVA
test (F(2, 2281)=25.96; p<0.001) and Tukey´s post hoc test (p<0.01 for private space vs. balcony
and private space vs. shared or public space). Regarding views, the self-reported contribution was
significantly different depending on the view type (ANOVA test F(2, 3400)=533.5; p<0.001), with a
significant decreasing effect from natural views > mixed views > limited/urban views (Tukey´s post
hoc, p<0.001 for the three comparisons) (Table 4). Adjustment for socioeconomic variables did not
change the main results, confirming that the self-reported contribution was dependent on the type
of view and on the type of accessible outdoor space (SI Table S3).
Emotions were more positive among individuals with accessible outdoor spaces and natural
elements in views. Considering that the PHQ-4 scale focuses on depression and anxiety, and that
the lockdown situation may have caused a greater diversity of impacts, respondents were also
asked to self-assess their emotions before and during lockdown. During lockdown, the most
frequently mentioned word was “bored” (n = 559), while “optimistic” was the most frequently
mentioned to characterise the remembered emotional situation pre-lockdown (n = 1,177) (SI Table
S4). After the classification of emotions in a seven core type-emotions (i.e. angry, bad, disgusted,
fearful, happy, sad, surprised), results suggest that the emotional situation of people in Spain under
lockdown Level 1 worsened after the adoption of lockdown measures (during lockdown vs. before
lockdown, chi-square p<0.001), with a decrease from 71% to 26.2% in the emotions classified
inside the “happy” core-emotion (Figure 1). During lockdown, individuals with natural elements in
their views mentioned more positive emotions (“happy” accounts for 30.1%) than individuals with
limited or urban views (23.3%). No significant differences were encountered between view types in
the emotions reported to describe the emotional situation pre-lockdown (chi-squared p>0.05),
confirming that having natural elements in the view may have acted as a buffer against the negative
consequences of lockdown. Regarding outdoor spaces, individuals with accessible outdoor spaces
reported more positive emotions than individuals with no accessible outdoor spaces; however, the
difference was significant both during and before lockdown, and therefore, differences in emotions
cannot be directly linked to the lockdown situation.
Discussion
There are relatively few studies demonstrating that ecosystem services assessments can be
expanded to include their potential benefits on human mental health and well-being (23). However,
there is a growing body of evidence revealing the value of nature experiences for mental health
(19, 22, 24, 35, 40). With rapid urbanization and declines in human contact with nature, as well as
the potential increase of pandemics with global change, understanding how ecosystem services
can provide benefits in terms of mental health and human well-being during new lockdowns will
assist public health and other decision makers to take informed decisions on the type of measures
to adopt. Supporting our three hypotheses, greater lockdown severity was associated with a greater
likelihood of exhibiting symptoms of mental health disorders. However, these symptoms were lower
in the most severe lockdown scenario when individuals still had access to private outdoors spaces

5

such as balconies or gardens, and when their views from home included natural elements.
Furthermore, people self-identified the positive contributions of nature views and outdoor spaces
and maintained a more positive attitude in terms of mood when they had access to these resources
during lockdown.
Previous studies have explored the physical and mental benefits of spending time outdoors
(33), and the buffering effect of nature in individuals suffering from social isolation (19) or stressful
life events (37). In line with those studies and confirming our first hypothesis, our results showed
the clear negative effect of severe confinement on mental health, with people who had restricted
access to outdoor public spaces (Level 1) more likely to show symptoms of mental health disorders
than people who had partial (Level 2) or no restriction (Level 3) to access to outdoor spaces.
Furthermore, the lack of significant differences in terms of symptoms of depression and anxiety
between people in Level 2 and in Level 3 highlights the important role of contact with nature for
maintaining good mental health: even when authorities fixed a limited time to be outdoors (level 2),
this allowance had an important effect in reducing the likelihood of mental health issues.
During COVID-19, among people who could spend free time outdoors, the importance of
contact with nature from home to reduce the likelihood of suffering from depression and anxiety
was less important. Indeed, the buffering effect of nature (access to outdoor private spaces and
the views from windows) in the regression models was only clear for people at Level 1 of lockdown.
This result can be related to the variables selected to explore the contact with nature in the
regressions: access to outdoor spaces from home (yes/no) for direct contact, and the presence of
natural elements in views (yes/no) for indirect contact. These variables, related to residence
characteristics, are likely less important for individuals at Level 2 and 3, as they were able to
maintain access to outdoor spaces, e.g. public parks. Furthermore, the measures adopted in
countries in Level 2 and 3 (e.g. switching to home office working or being placed on furlough) might
have led to an increase in the time available and the possibility to spend it in natural outdoors
setting, with positive effect on well-being (21). For example, a recent study suggested that time
spent outdoors increased in Norway during COVID-19 lockdown (41).
Maintaining contact with nature has been reported to be beneficial in times of stress (37),
and exploring this effect in people who spent the first wave of COVID-19 under strict lockdown (e.g.
Spain) is especially relevant. The measures adopted in Spain to flatten the curve of the disease
were very restrictive (3), with inhabitants spending nearly two months (March-May 2020) under a
stay-at-home order. In this context, our findings confirmed that having accessible outdoor spaces
and natural elements in views from home were key factors associated with a reduced likelihood of
exhibiting symptoms of depression and anxiety, with differences in the effect across types of
accessible outdoor spaces and views. People who had access to a private outdoor space (e.g.
garden, swimming pool) coped better with lockdown limitations in terms of mental health, compared
to individuals who had balconies or shared/public spaces. The higher positive effect of private
outdoor spaces compared to balconies could be related to a higher space availability and a higher
naturalness of the space. The apparently more negative effect of public and shared outdoor spaces
compared to private outdoor spaces could be related to the presence of people in these spaces,
which can complicate the maintenance of the recommended social distance.
For types of views, mixed views (i.e. natural views plus urban views) were found to be the
ones with the most positive association. Longstanding research has shown that, all else equal,
people are willing to pay more for houses and hotel rooms with views of nature (42, 43), which can
be interpreted in terms of benefits from cultural ecosystem services. Further research is needed to
elucidate if under COVID-19 lockdown, there are significant differences between types of nature
views, e.g. if views to blue spaces have a higher buffering effect than green spaces, as suggested
by previous studies (34). Further research could also test whether there are significant differences
between the type of contact maintained with nature during lockdown, e.g. by comparing passive

6

contact (e.g. looking at nature through the window or sitting in the terrace) with active contact (e.g.
practicing physical activities outdoors).
The PHQ-4 scale was used to study mental health vs. contact with nature during lockdown.
However, as divergent results might be obtained for measured effect (PHQ-4) and human
perceptions and emotions, these were further analyzed. Focusing on accessible outdoor spaces,
we found a similarity between what mental health scales indicated and people´s perceptions and
emotions: individuals with accessible outdoor spaces were not only less likely to show symptoms
of depression and anxiety, but also perceived a more positive contribution of those spaces and
maintained more positive emotions than individuals with no accessible outdoor spaces.
Interestingly, differences in emotions between people with and without accessible outdoor spaces
existed before lockdown, suggesting that the positive effect of those spaces is also important under
normal circumstances (23, 44). Regarding views, some discrepancies arose between what mental
health scales indicated and what respondents perceived: no significant differences were found
between people with mixed and natural views in the likelihood of depression symptoms; however,
a more positive effect of views was perceived among individuals with natural views over those with
mixed views. Regarding emotions, results suggested that the buffering effect of views was
especially relevant only under severe isolation situations such as COVID-19 lockdown, as no
significant differences between views were found in the emotions mentioned to describe their mood
before lockdown.
Apart from severity of lockdown measures, accessibility to outdoor spaces and views from
home, other factors might influence the prevalence of symptoms of poor mental health. In this
study, we found that psychological resilience, age and gender were important factors predicting the
likelihood of showing symptoms of depression and/or anxiety during COVID-19, with consistent
effect across the different levels of lockdown. Psychological resilience reflects the adaptative
capacity of an individual to respond to current or future challenges (45), and our results showed
that individuals with higher resilience had lower odds of showing symptoms of depression and
anxiety. Resilience is considered a developmental characteristic that can be enhanced (46),
meaning that measures can be taken to psychologically prepare and protect individuals for future
pandemics.
Regarding age, younger people had higher odds of depression and anxiety symptoms than
older people. This is interesting, since this age group was less severely hit by the disease, with
milder physical symptoms and fewer severe cases than older people. Also, considering that under
normal circumstances, the odds to show symptoms of mental health disorders such as anxiety
increase with age (47). Yet, our results for age are consistent with studies on mental health carried
out during the COVID-19 (15, 48). Despite social media communication having potentially played
an essential role in socialization, this age group may have a higher natural demand for physical
socialization, which was lacking during lockdown. For gender, the prevalence of depression and
anxiety pre-COVID-19 has been previously reported as higher among women than men (49), and
our study suggests that this higher prevalence continues under extreme situations such as
lockdown. Our study might be showing a confounding effect of age and gender, as young women
likely had more childcare responsibilities during lockdown2.
Some personal characteristics were relevant for certain lockdown levels and for depression
and/or anxiety, i.e. individuals who suffered a change in employment after COVID-19 and pet
owners. Many people have lost their jobs during the pandemic 3, and under the expected economic
crisis in the years to come it is not surprising to find a higher risk of mental health disorders among

7

people who are undergoing an unstable employment situation (50). The higher odds for depression
and anxiety found among pet owners and in Level 1 of lockdown was a surprising result, as these
individuals could spend extra time outdoors to walk their pet. However, it could be related to the
fact that they were proportionally more restricted, if compared to their standard walks (e.g. in some
countries there were limitations on the times that one could go out to walk the pet), transforming
the usually-pleasant activity into an obligation with health risks.
When interpreting our results, the limitations of the study, especially the ones related with
sampling, should be considered. Due to the limited time to prepare and conduct the study, the
survey could only be translated and distributed in English and Spanish. Also, to capture a sample
from as many countries as possible and while the lockdown measures were in place, the snow-ball
sampling technique was used. These decisions influenced the composition of the sample, with a
bias towards responses from Spain and an over-representation of high-educated people. Still, as
mentioned above, our results are consistent with other studies published on mental health in times
of COVID-19.
This study provides evidence that maintaining contact with nature in extreme situations
such as the COVID-19 pandemic may be important for mental health. This beneficial effect is linked
to the idea of ecosystem services, which are defined as the ecological characteristics, functions
and processes that contribute to human well-being (51, 52). The human benefits obtained from
contact with nature are classified as cultural ecosystem services, i.e. the non-material outputs that
promote physical and mental health and have positive effect on social relationships (53, 54). All in
all, the “restorative effect of nature” analyzed in psychological studies and “non-material outputs
from nature” analyzed from the ecosystem services perspective appear to be two bodies of
knowledge studying the same concept from different disciplines (23). In extreme situations such as
the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of cultural ecosystem services to protect human health
and well-being is more evident than ever. Indeed, the extreme situation that we all underwent (and
continue to be responsive to) both individually and as a society, as well as the apparent role of
nature to protect us, can be used to increase awareness of the tremendous challenges we are
facing. The increasing pressures and degradation of the environment, which its most evident
consequence is climate change, are risking the ecosystem services we obtain from nature and
humans´ survival. Indeed, the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic has been linked to the
degradation of the environment and the situation is expected to worsen with more frequent and
more rapidly spreading disease outbreaks (55). Therefore, it is important to support transformative
changes that protect nature and reduce the risk of suffering from new pandemics, but also to be
ready to face them in the future. The first wave of COVID-19 has been an unwanted experiment
from which lessons can be learnt if we analyse the (un)intended outcomes of the implemented
measures. Critical analysis of lessons will help individuals and societies prepare for future
coronavirus-like situations.
In this sense, our results can be valuable in the design of future lockdown measures and
urban plans. We found that the lockdown measures adopted led to negative consequences in
people´s mental health, with clear differences across the levels of lockdown. Therefore, future
measures should be designed to protect individuals from the disease and from the mental and
physical consequences of social isolation and stay-at-home orders. We acknowledge that the first
criteria to be considered when trying to control an epidemic or pandemic should be medical and
epidemiological. But if future studies do not find clear differences in flattering the curve of the
infections between countries in Level 1 and Level 2 lockdowns, the less strict Level 2 could be a
more adequate approach to control the disease, while at the same time reducing the likelihood of
suffering mental health disorders. However, if epidemiologic studies confirm that the spread of the
disease is only avoidable under strict lockdown, we recommend health authorities to be ready for
a higher prevalence of mental health disorders, especially focusing on vulnerable subgroups such
as women, young people or people with no contact with nature.

Finally, an important aspect to be considered is the difference in accessibility to nature
across the population. We found that house characteristics, such as outdoor spaces and views
played an important role on people´s mental health during the first wave of COVID-19, with
important differences across types of spaces and views. When designing future urban plans, and
similar to the plans to make cities more resilient to climate change (56), houses and cities should
be adapted to ensure that we live in healthy spaces, and that we are resilient to the consequences
of future pandemics. For example, at the house level, it can be appropriate to ensure that new
houses in densely populated areas include terrace and/or balconies4. At the city level, the plans to
restore, protect and promote the public green-blue spaces and their ecosystem services, and
advances towards equal accessibility to these spaces (57, 58), should be accompanied with
measures to guarantee greater space that allows for physical distancing in times of pandemics.
Materials and Methods
Survey structure and distribution. The online survey comprised 54 questions divided into 12
sections (SI Survey). The objective was to collect responses from as many countries as possible
to capture the highest diversity of lockdown conditions; therefore, the survey was designed in
English and translated to Spanish. The survey was distributed using Google Forms, between 17th
April and 8th May 2020, starting when most European countries had spent at least one month under
lockdown (4) and finishing when some countries started to ease lockdown measures5,6.
The first question of the survey was related to the level of lockdown in which the respondent
was when answering the survey. This question allowed for the classification of responses according
to the three levels of lockdown mentioned in the introduction.
For analyzing mental health issues, the PHQ-4 screening scale was used (59). The PHQ4 scale is a self-administered survey, commonly used in primary care and in remote health surveys
to detect people at risk of suffering depression and anxiety (59–61). It composed of four questions
or two ultra-brief screening scales with two questions each: the GAD-2 for screening anxiety
disorders (62); and the PHQ-2 for screening depression disorders (63). Respondents chose
between four possible response options (from “not at all” (0) to “nearly every day” (3)). Scores for
the GAD-2 and PHQ-2 range from 0-6, and for PHQ-4, from 0 to 12.
Using the PHQ-4 scale, we explored the negative effect of lockdown on symptoms of
depression and anxiety; however, lockdown measures may have enhanced a much broader range
of emotions. To capture emotional changes, respondents self-assessed their emotions pre- and
during lockdown, using a figure designed based on Plutchik´s wheel of emotions (64). The figure
comprised a total of 41 emotions classified in seven core emotions (i.e., happy, sad, disgusted,
angry, fearful, bad, surprised). Respondents had to select the emotions that best described their
current general mood and their character under normal and before coronavirus outbreak (they were
asked to select between one and three emotions in each question).
For the sociodemographic characterization of respondents, 14 questions were included
regarding age, gender, marital status, country of residence, maximum education level achieved,
employment status before and during COVID-19, annual gross income and pet ownership. To
characterize the psychological resilience of respondents, the 4-item BRCS was included (18, 65).
The BRCS captures how adaptable individuals are to cope with stress. To characterize the
conditions of the lockdown, questions on the company of others during lockdown were included:
whether they spent the lockdown alone, with kids and with people with special care needs. Also,
questions on the characteristics of the residence were collected (size, views from residence and

accessible outdoor spaces). Respondents indicated to what extent the views and the accessibility
to outdoor spaces helped them to cope better with the lockdown situation, by answering two Likertscale questions (1-not at all, 5-very much).
The design of the final survey followed the data protection advice for social studies of the
Norwegian Centre for Research Data (NSD). According to the NSD 7, surveys that are distributed
online do not need to be formally approved by an ethics committee if they comply with the following
standards: (i) the survey does not include information that can identify individuals directly (e.g.name
and surname, email) or indirectly (e.g. combination of questions such as postal code, age and
marital status); and (ii) the survey will not be connected to identifying information about the
respondent (e.g. IP address or email address). The final version of the survey complied with these
requirements.
The survey was distributed using a snow-ball sampling technique: the link to the survey
was distributed among authors´ professional and personal contacts using email and social media
(e.g. WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter), so recipients could re-forward within their
contacts and social networks. The link to survey was also shared by authors´ institutions social
media. Once the survey was closed, answers were downloaded and deleted from the platform.
Data analysis. All the statistical analyses were performed in R (version 3.6.2.) using RStudio (66),
considering a significant level of p < 0.05. The values of the screening scales were transformed to
categorical variables: the PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scales results (values from 0 to 6) were classified into
two groups, applying a cut-off value of ≥ 3, in accordance with studies that fixed scores 3-or-greater
as a good cut-point for screening for potential cases of depression and anxiety (62, 63). The PHQ4 scale results (values from 0 to 12), which serves as marker of psychological distress, were
transformed as None-to-minimal (values ≤ 2), Mild (3-5), Moderate (6-8) and Severe (9-12) (59).
To elucidate whether levels of lockdown (hypothesis 1), types of accessible outdoor spaces
(hypothesis 2a) and types of views (hypothesis 2b) influenced mental health, Kruskal-Wallis Test
followed by Dunn´s Test for multiple comparisons was used for PHQ-4 (ordinal variable with >2
categories) and the Chi-squared test with pairwise comparison as post hoc test for PHQ-2 and
GAD-2 (ordinal variable with 2 categories). The p-values of post hoc tests were adjusted with
Bonferroni corrections. Mental health scale values were compared between levels of lockdown
using the whole sample (n = 6,080), while for mental health scale values vs. types of accessible
outdoor spaces and types of views, the subsample of respondents in Spain under Level 1 of
lockdown (n = 3,403) was used. The level of lockdown in Spain was one of the most severe in
Europe, and the high number of responses received from this country allowed for a more in-depth
analysis, splitting responses according to types of views and types of accessible outdoors spaces.
To determine the relative odds that individuals with meaningful symptoms of depression and
anxiety (i.e. above the cut-off value of ≥ 3), logistic GLMs were built.
To test hypothesis 1, models were built with PHQ-2 and GAD-2 results as a function of
lockdown level, access to outdoor spaces and natural elements in the views from windows. Models
were estimated for the whole sample and dividing the sample by severe lockdown (Level 1) and
other types of lockdown (Level 2 and 3). The accessibility to outdoor spaces was introduced as a
binary variable in the model, considering if respondents had access to any outdoor spaces or not,
independently of the type. The information on views was transformed to a binary variable
considering if the view included any natural element (no = few views or urban views, yes = rest of
views).
To analyse if the effect of contact with nature on mental health varied depending on the
type of views and type of accessible outdoor spaces (i.e. hypothesis 2), the subsample of
respondents in Spain under Level 1 of lockdown was used. Logistic GLMs used PHQ-2 and GAD7

2 results as dependent variables and two independent variables: 1) the type of accessible outdoor
spaces, as a four-category variable (none, balcony, other private areas [e.g. private garden] and
shared or public areas); and 2) the type of views that respondents could see from their lockdown
residence, as a three-category variable considering the level of natural component (few views or
urban views, mixed views and natural views).
All the models were later adjusted with 11 variables including sociodemographic
characteristics, lockdown conditions and personal characteristics: age (18-25 years=reference),
gender (female=reference), maximum education level achieved (primary or secondary=reference),
whether employment situation changed after coronavirus outbreak (no=reference), income
(transformed to categorical variable by estimating the ratio Income / per capita Gross Domestic
Product [GDP], and with income/GDP<2=reference), BRCS (numeric), whether respondents
owned a pet that needed walking outside (no=reference), residence size (ratio of rooms per people
in lockdown) and characteristics of the company during lockdown, such as whether respondent
was alone (no=reference), with kids (no=reference), and with people with special care needs
(no=reference). The variables were tested against multicollinearity estimating the Variance Inflation
Factor (VIF) and assuming a threshold value of <3 (67). The logistic GLMs were built in R Studio
(66) using the stats package (68). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were
estimated with the questionr package (69), and the fit of the models as the Cox and Snell Pseudo
R2 estimate using the DescTools package (70).
Finally, two additional analysis were performed to test hypothesis 2a and 2b related with:
a) respondent perceptions on the effect of views and outdoor spaces in coping with lockdown
measures, depending on types of outdoor spaces and views; and b) the emotions that respondents
mentioned as their most common feeling during lockdown and that better describe their character
under normal circumstances. The self-reported effect of access to outdoor spaces was analysed
with the responses to the Likert-scale question: To what extent do you think having physical access
to these areas is helping you to better cope with the lockdown? The self-reported effect of views
was analysed with the responses to: To what extent do you think having that view is helping you to
better cope with the lockdown? To test for significant differences across types of accessible outdoor
spaces and views, a one-way ANOVA was conducted, followed by post hoc Tukey´s honestly
significant difference (HSD) test. Two Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression models were built
with the scores in the two Likert-scales as dependent variables, and 1) type of accessible outdoor
area or 2) type of views as independent variable. Regressions were adjusted with the same 11
sociodemographic variables used in the above-mentioned GLMs. When analysing the perceived
contribution of accessible outdoor spaces, individuals with no accessible outdoor spaces did not
answer the question and therefore were excluded from the analyses.
Regarding changes in emotions, those mentioned by respondents under strict lockdowns
as their most common feeling during lockdown were compared with the ones selected to describe
their character under normal circumstances. Additional comparisons were performed to compare
emotions of individuals with vs. without access to outdoor spaces and natural elements in views.
Emotions were ordered according to the frequency they were mentioned using the tm package in
R (71, 72), and later grouped according to the seven core emotions (SI Survey). To determine if
frequency of core emotions changed after lockdown, and if differences exist depending on access
to outdoor spaces and natural elements on views, the Chi-squared Test of Independence was used.

Table 3. Comparison of PHQ-4 (Patient Health Questionnaire), PHQ-2 and GAD-2 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) values between types of
views and types of accessible outdoor spaces. The subsample of people in Spain and in Level 1 (3393 obs.) was used. The statistical test
performed were Chi-squared test for GAD-2 and PHQ-2 values and Kruskal Wallis test for PHQ-4 values. Different letters (A,B) indicate significant
differences (p<0.05) between groups (i.e. lockdown levels), after pairwise comparison for PHQ-2 and GAD-2 and after post hoc Dunn Test for PHQ4. The post hoc tests´ p-values were calculated with Bonferroni correction for multiple-comparisons.
