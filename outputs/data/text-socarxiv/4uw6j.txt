Abstract
This study investigates the impact of COVID-19 pandemic public closure orders on business
listings for gay bars. Recent studies have shown gay bars to be quite vulnerable, with listings
showing a 36.6% decline between 2007 and 2019. To supplement historic data from
comprehensive printed listings, the Damron Guide, we conducted a census of online business
listings. We verified each listing in the 2019 edition, also searching for new bars that were not
included in that version. Results show that gay bar listings declined by 15.2% between 2019 and
Spring 2021. This compares, however, to a 14.4% decline for 2017 and 2019, indicating a
surprisingly stable rate of decline. This stability may be a methodological artifact, but may also
reflect the relative resources of surviving gay bars going into pandemic, and/or their continuing
vulnerability and precarity.

In March 2020, most U.S. states implemented public closure orders for bars and restaurants to
prevent coronavirus transmission, shuttering them temporarily in some jurisdictions and
drastically reducing occupancy in others. Gay bars are more vulnerable to closure than bars in
general (Anderson and Knee forthcoming). A recent study found 36.6% fewer gay bar listings in
2019 than 2007, citing trends including rising social equality that frees LGBTQ+ people to
socialize in other establishments and the rise of geolocating smartphone apps permitting
LGBTQ+ people to meet each other virtually (Mattson 2019). How have gay bars fared recently
given these intersecting trends?
Data come from two sources. Historic data come from counts of the number of gay bars
listed in the Damron LGBT Travel Guide, the only national and most complete listings of
LGBTQ+ places (Knopp and Brown forthcoming). Guides were sampled at 5-year intervals to
coincide with the Census of Business data from the United States Economic Census and
supplemented with the most recent guide to be published, in 2019.
Data for 2021 come from an online census of gay bars taken from March to May of that
year. Using the 2019 Damron Guide as a baseline, we verified each of its 860 listings using the
Yelp and Google Business directories, cross checking each bar for social media activity on
Facebook and Instagram. Businesses that were not marked as permanently closed on business
directories or that had active social media presence were coded as existing even if not currently
open to patrons. Yelp was used to look for new gay bars or ones that had not been counted in the
2019 printed guide by searching the geographic areas of each state.

Figure 1 shows that there were 15.2% fewer gay bars listed in online business directories in
Spring 2021 (N=729) than in the 2019 Damron Guide (N=860). This compares to a 14.4
decrease in business listings between the 2017 (N=1005) and 2019 Damron Guides. This
relatively stable rate of decline is surprising, despite the lack of comparable data for bars in
general. It may be that the most vulnerable gay bars had already closed before the pandemic, and
thus those that remained had at least some resources to sustain themselves, such as the ability to
crowdfund (Author). It is also likely that many of the bars we coded as existing are themselves
quite vulnerable, and that as government programs to support small business wane, more
closures may be imminent.
Results should also be interpreted with caution. The methodology for collecting the 2021 data
was different than that used by Damron (see Knopp and Brown and Mattson for descriptions).
Rates of change in listings may not reflect actual rates of declines of establishments. Until further
data become available, however, this study suggests that the decline in gay bars continues apace
despite, if not necessarily because, of the COVID-19 pandemic.
