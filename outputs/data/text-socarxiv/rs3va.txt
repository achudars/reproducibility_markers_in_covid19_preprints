Abstract
It is known that the new coronavirus (COVID-19) is disproportionately affecting the
elderly, those with underlying medical conditions, and the poor. What is the effect of informing
the public about these inequalities on people’s perceptions of threat and their sensitivity to the
outbreak’s human toll? This study answers this question using a novel survey experiment and
finds that emphasis on the unequal aspect of the pandemic, especially as it relates to the elderly
and those with medical conditions, could be causing the public to become less concerned about
the outbreak and its human toll. Discussion situates this finding in the literature on scientific
communication and persuasion and explains why language that emphasizes the impact of the
virus on ​all of us -- rather than singling out certain groups -- could be more effective in
increasing caution among the general public and make them take the situation more seriously.

Introduction
Within a few months after its first emergence in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the
novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread to almost every country on earth, including the US
[1]. As of September 2020, the human toll of the disease worldwide is more than 30 million
confirmed cases and nearly one million deaths [2]. Very few disease outbreaks in history have
had such a fast and widespread impact on humanity, with the closest example being the 1918 flu
pandemic [3].
Despite the global nature of the outbreak that has impacted peoples of all sexes, races,
and cultural backgrounds, it is known that the disease is not affecting everyone in the same way.

2

In particular, the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of
severe illness due to the virus [4]. Similarly, more infections and deaths are reported in poor and
low-income communities compared to wealthier ones [5]. Neither of these patterns are surprising
given what we know about health disparities [6-10] and the unequal impact of epidemics on
certain groups [11-12].
While the outbreak is far from having a uniform impact on different groups, the way the
media and the scientific community is talking about the outbreak does not always touch upon
this unequal aspect of the pandemic. Oftentimes, the account instead emphasizes the ​equalizing
aspect of the pandemic, whereby the virus threatens all of us -- all Americans or the entirety of
humanity -- regardless of our background [13]. Other times, the discussion revolves specifically
around how the pandemic has been especially hard on certain groups, such as the elderly and the
sick [14].
How do these different framings of the pandemic affect the public opinion? In particular,
is one framing more or less effective than the other in terms of how it influences whether or not
the public sees the outbreak as a serious threat or not and whether it is more important to save
lives or to save the economy as the outbreak unfolds? This study answers this question using a
novel survey experiment and finds that emphasis on the unequal aspect of the pandemic,
especially as it relates to the elderly and those with medical conditions, could be causing the
public to become less concerned about the outbreak and its human toll. Discussion situates this
finding in the literature on scientific communication and persuasion and explains why language
that emphasizes the impact of the virus on ​all of us -- rather than singling out certain groups --

3

could be more effective in increasing caution among the general public and make them take the
situation more seriously.

Materials and methods
The project has IRB approval from University of California-Berkeley (protocol type:
Soc-Behav-Ed Exempt; protocol number: 2020-04-13247; protocol title: Perceptions of
inequality during the coronavirus outbreak). Written consent was obtained from respondents at
the start of the survey.

Experimental design
The study is designed as a between-subjects survey experiment. It randomized each
respondent into one of three conditions corresponding to three possible framings of the
pandemic: (1) the “equal pandemic” framing, which does not say anything about the disparate
impact of the pandemic on different groups but instead emphasizes how the outbreak has been
affecting everyone regardless of their background; (2) the “elderly and medical conditions
inequality” framing, which specifically emphasizes the unequal aspect of the pandemic in that it
has been especially hard on the elderly and those with medical conditions; and (3) the “class
inequality” framing, which specifically emphasizes the unequal aspect of the pandemic in that it
has been especially hard on the poor and low-income communities. These conditions are chosen
to reflect the ways that the pandemic is discussed in public discourse.

4

The experiment flows as follows. First, respondents are recruited into the study and asked
to give their consent. (At this stage, respondents are told that the goal of the survey is to
“understand the public’s opinions regarding important societal and economic trends in the US.”
This general wording is chosen over using specific words such as coronavirus and inequality in
an attempt to make sure respondents are not primed to think about these issues from the start.)
Second, they are asked to watch a short clip with subtitles and told that the purpose of showing
this video is to assess their comprehension skills; the content of the clips depends on the
experimental condition respondents are in. Third, right after watching the video, they are asked
to briefly describe the content of the video using their own words. Fourth, they answer a series of
general questions related to their attitudes towards inequality as well as their socio-demographic
characteristics such age, gender, race, and income.
Finally, respondents answer questions that are specifically related to the coronavirus
outbreak. These questions include: (1) whether the respondent thinks the coronavirus is a serious
threat to the American people or not; (2) whether the respondent thinks it is more important to
save lives or to save the economy during this outbreak; how satisfied the respondent is with the
way (3) their city, (4) their state, and (5) the federal government has been handling the
coronavirus situation; (6) how the respondent has been affected by the coronavirus outbreak; and
(7) how many times the respondent went outside in the past seven days.
Answers given to questions (1) and (2) constitute the main dependent variables in the
study. Both variables take values between 1 and 5 with higher values denoting higher threat
perceptions in the case of the first variable (1=not a threat at all, 2=a small threat, 3=a threat, 4=a
serious threat, 5=a very serious threat) and attaching more importance to saving the economy

5

over saving lives in the case of the second variable (1=saving lives must be the priority even if it
means the economy will suffer, 2, 3, 4, 5=saving the economy must be the priority even if it
means lives will be lost). Answers given to questions (3), (4), and (5) are similarly coded to take
values between 1 and 5 with higher values denoting more satisfaction.
Multiple binary variables have been generated based on question (6), including whether
the respondent or someone in the respondent’s family (i) is at risk, (ii) has contracted the virus,
(iii) lost their job due to the outbreak, or (iv) experienced a significant decrease in income due to
the outbreak. The “at risk” variable is particularly important here because given that the current
crisis is caused by a disease outbreak, those who are at risk of severe illness and death will likely
view and respond to the crisis very differently compared to those who are not at risk. The
variable based on Question (7) takes values between 0 and 7. (See S1 Appendix for the
experimental texts, images, videos, manipulation check question, survey questions, and other
related project content including additional variables and conditions. The study design is
pre-registered, while the specific hypotheses tested in this paper are not.)

Implementation and subject recruitment
The survey experiment is implemented using Qualtrics. The videos presented to
respondents as part of the experiment are prepared using iMovie and subsequently uploaded to a
YouTube channel created by the researcher (videos are “unlisted”, have comments disabled, and
show subtitles by default). All videos showed an Adobe Stock licensed image in the background
related to the content of the narrated text. The experimental texts themselves are written by the
researcher after a careful reading of relevant news articles and scientific communications.

6

The texts narrated to respondents in the videos are recorded by a young female in her
20’s speaking Standard American English. Female voice is chosen over male voice due to
evidence that shows that people tend to find the female voice to be more credible [15]. The
narrated text is also displayed as actual text under the video in case the respondent experiences a
problem watching the video or chooses not to watch. (As discussed later under Results, the
researcher confirmed that most respondents watched and understood the videos.)
Data collection took place on ​Lucid Theorem​. This platform gives researchers access to
cheap, fast (thousands of responses within hours), and high quality data that is also nationally
representative based on age, gender, ethnicity, and region. A recent scholarly work also validated
the quality of Lucid samples [16]. (All code, materials, and de-identified data will be made
public once the study is over.)

Sample characteristics and data structure
The survey experiment is run on a total of 2,617 respondents with approximately 870
respondents in each condition. The three conditions appear to be balanced on the demographic
covariates, which gives us confidence that randomization worked as expected. All analyses are
conducted on a dataset with the following simple structure: one row per respondent and as many
columns as there are variables. Respondents are required to be US residents and 18 or older. (See
S2 Appendix for information on sample size calculations, exact sample sizes by condition, and
summary demographics by condition.)

Overview of statistical models used

7

Linear regression models are fit to data with the experimental condition as the
independent variable. The equal pandemic condition is used as the reference category to be able
to get estimates for the elderly and medical conditions inequality and class inequality conditions.
(Note that the choice of reference category is somewhat arbitrary as it can be reasonably argued
that equal pandemic is actually the distinct frame here. Accordingly, additional models were fit
to data -- see S3 Appendix -- that treat the inequality conditions as the reference category to
estimate an equal pandemic effect. These additional models do not change our substantive
conclusions at all but allow us to see the story from the opposite angle.)
Since the inclusion of socio-demographic covariates does not change our conclusions -this is not surprising as the independent variable is randomly assigned to respondents -- the main
text only discusses models without these covariates. (S3 Appendix presents results both with and
without socio-demographic covariates for the sake of transparency in line with recent scholarly
work [17]. Models with additional outcomes as well as results based on ordinal logistic
regression models -- which do not change the substantive conclusions discussed in the text -- are
also presented.)

Results

Manipulation checks
Manipulation checks are used in experimental research to determine whether the subjects
actually received the treatments the researcher intended them to receive. The researcher

8

confirmed that most respondents actually watched the videos by checking the number of
YouTube “views” of each video. Most respondents also passed the manipulation check question,
that is, clearly understood the text being communicated to them. (The researcher used a custom
script to look for certain keywords such as “coronavirus” or “elderly” to make sure that
respondents’ description of the video was correct.) Furthermore, conclusions presented here
remain unchanged regardless of whether or not we restrict the sample to only those respondents
who passed the manipulation check.

Main findings
The experiment had a significant impact on respondents’ opinions regarding whether
coronavirus is a serious threat or not and whether the priority should be saving lives or saving the
economy. As far as opinions regarding whether coronavirus is a serious threat or not are
concerned, respondents who saw the elderly and medical conditions inequality condition (which
emphasizes how the pandemic has been especially hard on the elderly and those with medical
conditions) reported significantly lower levels of threat perception compared to respondents who
saw the equal pandemic condition (coefficient estimate = -0.166, p-value = 0.001, see left panel
of Fig 1). Regarding opinions as to whether the priority should be saving lives or saving the
economy, respondents who saw the elderly and medical conditions inequality condition reported
significantly more support towards saving the economy over saving lives compared to equal
pandemic (coefficient estimate = 0.201, p-value = 0.001, see right panel of Fig 1).

​ 2,617.

Digging deeper into these patterns revealed an interesting treatment-effect heterogeneity.
Both of the effects discussed in the previous paragraph are mainly driven by respondents who are
neither at risk themselves nor have family members who are at risk. Significant treatment effects
are observed only in this not-at-risk group, while the treatment effect decreases in magnitude by
more than half and loses statistical significance among respondents who are at risk or have at risk
family members (see Fig 2). Effect heterogeneity is demonstrated by fitting separate models for
at-risk and not-at-risk sub-groups (i.e., fitting two separate regressions of the outcome on the
experimental conditions, one on the at-risk sample and the other on the not-at-risk sample). The
elderly and medical conditions inequality coefficient estimate for the outcome “coronavirus
serious threat” is -0.061 (p-value = 0.454) for respondents at risk and -0.184 (p-value = 0.004)
for respondents not at risk. Similarly, the elderly and medical conditions inequality coefficient
estimate for the outcome “economy must be saved” is 0.101 (p-value = 0.348) for respondents at
risk and 0.226 (p-value = 0.003) for respondents not at risk.

The bars denote 95% confidence intervals. ​N​=2,617.

In addition to the procedure described here to investigate effect heterogeneity, the
researcher fitted additional, pooled models that explicitly modeled the outcome as a function of

10

the experimental conditions, the at-risk variable, and interactions between the two. The
interactions from these models are insignificant, which is not surprising because the experiment
was not powered to be able to detect interaction effects. That said, the at-risk main effects are
significant and both the at-risk main effects and interactions are in the expected direction (i.e.,
opposite of the treatment effects), which explains why the treatment effects are drastically
smaller -- two to three times -- in the at-risk sub-sample. (See S3 Appendix for results based on
the models with interactions.)
While the elderly and medical conditions inequality condition led to significant changes
in both outcomes, the class inequality condition was weaker in its effects. Despite the effect
being in the same direction as elderly and medical conditions inequality, class inequality led to
significant changes only in the “economy must be saved” outcome. The class inequality
coefficient estimates are -0.067 (p-value = 0.199) for the “coronavirus serious threat” outcome,
which is less than half the magnitude of the elderly and medical conditions inequality effect, and
0.138 (p-value = 0.027) for the “economy must be saved” outcome, which is about only
two-thirds of the elderly and medical conditions inequality effect. See Table 1 for a compact
presentation of the estimated coefficients associated with the experimental conditions for both
outcomes. (The statistically significant class inequality effect disappears when we control for the
socio-demographic covariates.) On the other hand, data show that the class inequality condition
had a nearly significant negative effect of -0.111 (p-value = 0.058) on satisfaction with state’s
handling of the coronavirus situation; no significant effects are observed for elderly and medical
conditions inequality or for the other two satisfaction outcomes (city and federal government).

Discussion
The information the public receives regarding the coronavirus outbreak influences their
threat perceptions and whether they think saving the economy or saving lives should be the
priority. Results from this study show that being informed about the disproportionate negative
impact of the pandemic on the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions make people
less likely to see coronavirus as a threat and more likely to prioritize saving the economy as
opposed to saving lives, particularly among those who do not need to worry about themselves or
someone in their family being at risk of severe illness.
These findings suggest that the dissemination of scientific information regarding the
unequal impact of the pandemic on certain groups could actually be causing the general public to
become less concerned about the outbreak and its human toll. The fact that the effect is primarily
observed among people not at risk further indicate that when those people are sensitized to the
situation of the weak they feel more secure about their own situation as not being at risk, which
likely leads to increased optimism bias [18] and underestimation of their risk of infection [19].
These results give more support to mechanisms of deliberation and callousness as opposed to
sympathy [20-22].

12

While information regarding the disproportionate negative impact of the pandemic on
the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions had a significant impact on coronavirus
threat perceptions and preferences regarding whether saving lives or saving the economy should
be the priority, information regarding the disproportionate negative impact of the pandemic on
the poor did not have as big of an impact on the outcomes and generally failed to achieve
statistical significance. One possible explanation for this null effect is that issues around class are
highly politicized in the US, and so it is more difficult to move people’s opinions on these topics
compared to a more neutral and directly health-related topic such as the elderly and those with
medical conditions.
The findings also have important policy implications. If the policy goal is to increase
caution among the general public and make them take the situation more seriously, then
information that emphasizes solidarity -- “we are all in this together” -- is likely to be much more
effective, especially when it comes from a credible source [23-24]. This solidarity framework
should be employed even when informing the public about the unequal impact of the pandemic
on certain groups, so that the general public is not left with the impression that the outbreak
concerns only some -- not all -- of us.

Limitations
One of the limitations of the study is that the ‘elderly and medical conditions inequality’
and ‘class inequality’ conditions are completely separate from one another by design. This is
justified because the study is primarily concerned with how people understand the impact of the
pandemic, not about the actual facts. That said, it is certainly the case that the poor are more

13

likely to have medical conditions as a matter of science, and the current study does not look at
this issue that concerns how ‘elderly and medical conditions inequality’ and ‘class inequality’
angles intersect. Another, related limitation is that the experimental text used for the ‘class
inequality’ condition mentions minorities when discussing the impact of the pandemic on the
poor and low-income communities, which means that the condition refers to not only class but
also race disadvantage. Once again, while this choice is justified by virtue of the fact that the
framing is in line with the usual way the topic is discussed in public discourse -- see, e.g., the
recent United States Joint Economic Committee report on coronavirus [25] -- the literature on
group cues [26] tells us that whether the information is interpreted primarily in terms of class or
race will likely influence the way respondents answer survey questions. Therefore, investigating
how class and race axes intersect would be a fruitful area of future work. A final limitation is that
the custom script used for parsing the manipulation check question is developed by the
researcher alone and was not independently verified prior to data collection.

The new coronavirus (COVID-19) is not affecting everyone in the same way. The elderly and
those with underlying medical conditions such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes have been
disproportionately affected. The number of infections and deaths are significantly higher among
this group compared to the rest of the population.

Additional variables, conditions
This study is part of a larger project to understand the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on
Americans’ perceptions of inequality. The survey included many other questions related to
respondents’ general perceptions regarding opportunity, inequality, and redistribution that are not
directly relevant to this paper. The survey also had experimental conditions that are completely
unrelated to coronavirus (internet; ​elderly and medical conditions inequality without reference to
coronavirus; class inequality without reference to coronavirus). The researcher is writing another
paper in parallel based on these results and is happy to share any materials, data, and/or results if
requested.

Appendix: Sample

size calculations and

characteristics

Sample size calculations
Sample size calculations were made with the aim of being able to detect a small effect in
one-way ANOVA. The ​pwr.anova.test function in the ​R package ​pwr was used for this end.
Using this function, and assuming a small effect size (Cohen’s ​d = 0.075), a total of 2,250
respondents gives us more than 90% power to be able to detect the effect of interest. (Note that
Cohen’s ​d is defined as ​mu/sigma​, where ​mu is the raw effect size in the original scale and
sigma is the standard deviation of the outcome variable.) The specific function that was run was

this: ​pwr.anova.test(k=3, f=0.075, sig.level=0.05, power=0.9)​.

Sample characteristics
S2 Table 1 presents sample sizes by condition; since the variable indicating whether the
respondent or someone in the respondent’s family is at risk is used to show effect heterogeneity
in the main text, sample sizes disaggregated by this additional variable are also presented in
parentheses. S2 Table 2 presents summary demographics by condition, and S2 Table 3 presents
the distribution of respondents across states by condition.

S3 Table 1 presents linear regression results for the outcome “coronavirus serious threat,” while
S3 Table 2 presents linear regression results for the outcome “economy must be saved.” S3 Table
3 presents additional results for these outcomes based on ordinal logistic regression models. S3
Table 4 presents estimates disaggregated by respondent’s at risk status, and S3 Table 5 presents
estimates based on models that include interactions between the at-risk variable and the
experimental conditions. Finally, S3 Table 6 presents estimates from models that treat the two
inequality conditions as the reference category to report an effect estimate for the equal
pandemic condition, and S3 Table 7 presents results from additional outcomes related to
respondent’s level of satisfaction with the way their city, state, and the federal government has
been handling the coronavirus situation.
