Abstract
The population-level case-fatality rate (CFR) associated with COVID-19 varies substantially,
both across countries time and within countries over time. We analyze the contribution of two
key determinants of the variation in the observed CFR: the age-structure of diagnosed infection
cases and age-specific case-fatality rates. We use data on diagnosed COVID-19 cases and death
counts attributable to COVID-19 by age for China, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Spain, the
United States, and New York City. We calculate the CFR for each population at the latest data
point and also for Italy over time. We use demographic decomposition to break the difference
between CFRs into unique contributions arising from the age-structure of confirmed cases and
the age-specific case-fatality. In late April 2020, CFRs varied from 2.2% in South Korea to
13.0% in Italy. The age-structure of detected cases often explains more than two thirds of crosscountry variation in the CFR. In Italy, the CFR increased from 4.2% to 13.0% between March 9
and April 22, 2020, and more than 90% of the change was due to increasing age-specific casefatality rates. The importance of the age-structure of confirmed cases likely reflects several
factors, including different testing regimes and differences in transmission trajectories; while
increasing age-specific case-fatality rates in Italy could indicate other factors, such as the
worsening health outcomes of those infected with COVID-19. Our findings lend support to
recommendations for data to be disaggregated by age, and potentially other variables, to
facilitate a better understanding of population-level differences in CFRs. They also show the
need for well designed seroprevalence studies to ascertain the extent to which differences in
testing regimes drive differences in the age-structure of detected cases.

Introduction
The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been spreading rapidly across the world, and on March 11
2020 was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization.
COVID-19 outbreaks went along with mostly regular patterns of logarithmic increase of the
number of confirmed cases, with a few notable exceptions. The number of deaths associated with
COVID-19, however, have evolved considerably less regularly, and case-fatality rates (CFRs)
differ substantially between countries [1,2].
Examples of this discrepancy are shown in Fig 1. As of April 22, 2020, Germany had a total of
around 150 thousand confirmed infections and 5700 deaths, resulting in a CFR of around 3.8%.
Italy, on the other hand, up to the same day, had close to 174 thousand confirmed cases of
infection, around 23 thousand deaths, and a CFR of 13.0%. On April 13, Italy had roughly the
same number of cases as Germany on April 22, and a CFR of 12.7%. Thus, the outbreak in Italy
is going along with a much higher CFR, which has also increased over time [2,3].
Differences in the CFR could indicate that the risk of dying of COVID-19 among detected cases
differs between countries or changes within a population over time. On the other hand, it could
also imply compositional differences in the detected infections [1,3]. Specifically, the risk of
dying of COVID-19 is well-documented to increase with age. Thus, if the population of
confirmed infected individuals is older in one country or time period than in another, the CFR
will be higher, even if the age-specific risk of dying is the same.
Indeed, demographers have argued that age structure matters, and the age composition of the
reported cases has been suggested as a potential explanation for differences in CFRs [1-5]. So
far, however, there have been no assessments of the importance of
diagnosed cases versus the age-specific CFR.

the age structure of

Fig 1. COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths, and implied case-fatality rates (CFR) in Italy and
Germany since March 1, 2020 (Germany) and March 9, 2020 (Italy).

In this paper, we analyze cross-country differences in observed CFRs and within-country time
trends in CFRs. We use recent data on China, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Spain, the United
States, and New York City. We use a standard demographic decomposition technique to
disentangle two potential drivers of differences and trends: (1) the age structure of confirmed
cases and (2) age-specific case-fatality rates [6].
We interpret our findings in light of the unfolding knowledge about data-driven biases affecting
CFRs. Counts of confirmed cases and deaths might not be comparable across countries because
of differences in case and death definitions; differences in the underestimation of cases and in
their age structure as a consequence of the country-specific testing regime; reporting delays of
case counts and death counts; and differences in delays between symptoms and death [1,2].
These data-related issues might lead to over- or under-estimation of CFRs throughout the
epidemic, and more reliable estimates will only be available after its conclusion. Currently,

4

adjusting CFRs for all of these potential biases is challenging and beyond the scope of this paper.
Nevertheless, the method described in this paper is also readily applicable to adjusted estimates
of CFRs once they become available.
Decomposition approaches like the one used in this paper are commonly used to explain the role
of age structure on changing incidence rates [7]. They have also been applied to differences in
cancer fatality rates across regions with varying age structures [8]. We are not aware of any
application to CFRs of infectious diseases in general and the COVID-19 pandemic in particular.
To facilitate the application of the approach described in this paper, we provide code and
reproducibility materials for the open source statistical software R in a freely-accessible
repository on the Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/vdgwt/. Moreover, we also provide
some examples in an Excel spreadsheet in the same repository, and an interactive spreadsheet on
Google Docs: https://bit.ly/2WVkPAg.

Data and methods
Data
We gathered data on the cumulative number of diagnosed infections and deaths attributable to
COVID-19 for the following populations (in alphabetical order): China, Germany, Italy, South
Korea, Spain, the United States, and New York City. An overview of the data is given in Table
1. For Italy, we include a total of 8 days in the analysis, covering the period starting on March 9
and ending on April 22. For all other populations, we use the data of the most recent date. For
China, the most recent available age-specific data is from February, while for the remaining
cases the data is from April 22.

we use the latest data available to us. The age-specific data for China does not account for the
retrospective correction of the number of deaths. For Italy, we also analyze trends over time. The
cumulative cases and deaths shown for Italy in this table are for April 22.

All data is provided by the respective health authorities, and is collected as part of another
project which gathers and standardizes age-specific data on the COVID-19 pandemic [9]. The
database is continuously updated and freely available online, but we also provide snapshots of
the data used for the calculations in this paper together with the code. A complete list of sources
is provided in the documentation of the database project [9].
For some of the countries (Germany, Italy, Spain, United States, and New York City) age is not
available for some confirmed cases or deaths. The database project imputed the missing age
using the observed age distribution of cases or deaths, respectively [9]. Removing these cases
from the analysis altogether has no substantive impact on the results, except for Spain, where
around 28% of cases and 44% of deaths have no recorded age. Ignoring cases and deaths of
unknown age in Spain would therefore deflate age-specific case-fatality rates.
The original data is provided in different age groupings. For the decomposition, the age groups
have to match. The database project adjusted counts so that all countries conform with the age
groups of South Korea, for which the age groups are 10-year age groups from birth to 80+.

6

Counts were split using a recently proposed method tailored for this data situation [9,10]. The
supplementary materials show the original age groups of the data.

Case-fatality rates
The COVID-19 case-fatality rate (CFR) is defined as the ratio of deaths (D) associated with
COVID-19 divided by the number of detected COVID-19 cases (N): CFR=D/N. In our
application, the death and case counts are cumulative counts up to a certain date.
If case counts and death counts are available by age, which is our situation, the CFR can also be
written as a sum of age-specific CFRs weighted by the proportion of cases in a certain age group.
We use ùëé as an index to denote different age groups. These age groups could, for instance, be 0
to 9 years, 10 to 19 years, and so on, but other groupings are also possible. We define ageùê∑

specific CFRs as ùê∂ùëé = ùëÅùëé ; i.e., the number of deaths in age group ùëé divided by the number of
ùëé

cases in the same age group. The proportion of cases in age group ùëé is given by ùëÉùëé =

ùëÅùëé
ùëÅ

. Using

this notation, the CFR can be written as a weighted average of age-specific CFRs:
ùê∂ùêπùëÖ = ‚àëùëÉùëé ùê∂ùëé .
We use the weighted expression and a mathematical decomposition approach introduced by
Kitagawa to separate the difference between two CFRs into two distinct parts, one attributable to
age-structure and another to age-specific case-fatality [6]. The method attributes the total
difference into these two components, leaving no residual. In other words, if we use ùëñ and ùëó to
index two different populations, then the decomposition approach splits the difference between
their CFRs into
ùê∂ùêπùëÖùëñ ‚àí ùê∂ùêπùëÖùëó = ùõº + ùõø,
where the ùõº-component captures the effect of the age structure, and the ùõø -component indicates
the part of the difference attributable to age-specific case-fatality. The details of the method are
described in the supplementary materials, which also provides a step-by-step walk-through of the
decomposition.

Results
Country comparisons
Table 2 shows results for cross-country comparisons using the data from South Korea (April 22)
as a reference, with countries sorted by increasing CFR. We chose South Korea as the reference
because its CFR is arguably the closest match to its actual infection rate due to extensive testing
and an earlier onset of the epidemic; moreover, the CFR was comparably low, and
decompositions will estimate what factor leads other countries to differ from this low CFR
setting, making results easy to interpret. For all other countries, we use the most recent date
available to us, as shown in Table 1. In the supplementary materials, we provide additional
results using Germany (low CFR) and Italy (high CFR) as reference countries.

Table 2: Results of the cross-country decompositions of case-fatality rates (CFRs) using South Korea as
a reference case. The third column shows the difference between each country and South Korea as a
reference, and is calculated as the CFR of South Korea minus the CFR of the respective country. Data
for all countries is for April 22, except China (February 11).

Based on the cumulative data up to April 22, South Korea had a CFR of 2.2% (first line of the
table, column CFR). For all countries the difference to the South Korean CFR is shown in the
third column of the table (South Korea minus the respective country). The fourth and fifth
column of the table show the absolute contributions of the case age distribution and age-specific
fatality components, respectively. A negative number for the age structure indicates an older age
structure of detected cases compared to South Korea, while a negative number for the fatality
component indicates higher age-specific case-fatality rates compared to South Korea. The sixth
and seventh column of the table indicate the relative contributions of the components.
All countries and regions have a higher CFR than South Korea, as indicated by the negative
difference shown in column four of Table 2, and some of the differences are substantial. For
instance, the Italian is almost six times as high.
In many cases, the (relative) contributions of the ùõº-component (age structure) seem to be larger
than the ùõø -component (fatality), and the ùõº-component is always negative. This means that the
age structure of cases is an important factor in explaining why most countries we study fare
worse than South Korea. For instance, in the two cases with the highest CFRs ‚Äì Italy and Spain ‚Äì
the relative contributions were similar with the ùõº-component explaining around two thirds of the
difference (Italy: 65.7%; Spain: 69.2%), and the ùõø -component explaining the remainder. In
Germany, the case age structure is the main driver of the difference in CFRs relative to South
Korea, and explains close to 90% of the difference. The US and New York City seem to be an
exception, and the high CFR compared to South Korea seems to be mostly due to higher
mortality of infected individuals.

Trends over time: The case of Italy
For Italy we have a relatively long time series of data spanning several weeks. Table 3
documents how the Italian CFR evolved from March 9 to April 22, with selected dates presented
in between. The CFR of March 9 is used as a reference, and the decomposition shows which
factor is driving the trend in the CFR. From the beginning to the end of the period under study
the CFR almost tripled, from 4.3% to 13.0%. This increase over time is largely driven by
worsening fatality of COVID-19 ‚Äì the fatality component explaining more than 80% of the rise
in almost all time periods ‚Äì and changes in the age structure of cases only played a minor role,

9

with detected cases moving to a more favorable (younger) age distribution and slightly
counteracting the effect of worsening fatality. As a robustness check we changed the reference
period from March 9 to March 21 (CFR: 8.1%). This resulted in the fatality component
explaining more than 90% of the increase in CFR.

Table 3: Development of the Italian case-fatality rate (CFR) over time. The third column gives the
difference between the CFR of the respective date minus the CFR of March 9.

Discussion
Case-fatality rates (CFRs) associated with COVID-19 vary strongly across countries and over
time within countries. Our findings show that there is substantial variation in which factor
explains the differences in CFRs. Differences in the age distribution of detected infections in
some cases explain a substantial part of the total difference in CFRs. In particular, more than
50% of the difference in CFRs between countries with a low CFR and a high CFR can be
explained by the age structure of detected infections. In contrast, in Italy, we observe a
substantial increase in the CFR over time, mostly attributable to increasing age-specific casefatality.

10

Ultimately, the approach discussed here does not directly explain why the age structure of
confirmed cases or the age-specific case-fatality rates matter more in one case and less in
another, and some expertise about the contexts which are being compared is required to interpret
results. We discuss some potential explanations below, including potential data-related issues
and biases.
Differences in the age structure of the populations which are being compared are unlikely to be a
major driver of the age component that we estimated here, as the age composition of confirmed
cases does not necessarily match the age composition of the population. For instance, according
to Eurostat, the proportion of the population aged 80+ in 2019 was 7% in Italy and 6.5% in
Germany, while in our data the proportion of reported infections in the same age range was 24%
for Italy and only 11% in Germany.
Differences in testing regimes are a plausible mechanism driving both the different age structures
of detected cases, as well as different age-specific fatality rates to the extent that denominators
are underestimated in distinct degrees [3,11,12]. Results not shown here indicate that early in the
pandemic in March the difference in the CFRs of South Korea and Germany - two countries with
extensive and early tracing and testing of contacts of known cases - was largely driven by
differences in fatality. The low contribution of the case age distribution component to the CFR
disparity between South Korea and Germany suggests that these countries might have been more
successful at catching the mild and asymptomatic cases among the younger population groups.
Since then, the CFR of Germany has increased and the age structure of confirmed cases has
shifted to higher ages, and the age structure has become more important in explaining the gap
between South Korea and Germany, making test numbers alone an unlikely explanation for the
different age structure of detected cases.
Differences in the COVID-19 transmission pathways might also be a factor. Depending on
contact patterns and household structure, the elderly population might be affected earlier in some
countries than in others, leading to a less favorable age distribution of infections [4,13]. This
could be relevant in explaining why the age distribution plays such a large role for the two
countries with by far the highest CFR, Spain and Italy, which have a relatively large proportion
of individuals living with their elderly parents or grandparents, and comparatively intensive
intergenerational contact [14-16].

11

Disparities in age-specific case-fatality rates across countries may result from either differences
in age-specific prevalence of comorbidities, which exacerbate the risk of death from COVID-19
considerably [1,17] or differences in quality or saturation levels of the healthcare system. The
trend over time in the Italian CFR is an example where changes in age-specific case-fatality rates
are driving trends, instead of changes in the case age distribution. This likely reflects the
worsening situation in Italy over time as its health care system got under increasing pressure
[11,18]. However, an increase in CFR could also be expected once containment measures
become effective, and newly confirmed cases increase at a slower pace than deaths from cases
acquired prior to containment policies.
Only once an epidemic reaches its final conclusion and all cases have either resulted in recovery
or fatalities, can the importance of the age difference in cases on CFRs be assessed with an
acceptable degree of accuracy [19]. In this context a distinction should be made between CFRs,
which are solely based on detected cases, and infection fatality rates (IFRs), which estimate the
risk of dying once infected, including both confirmed and undiagnosed cases. Ideally policies for
containing the spread of a virus would be designed on the basis of IFRs. However, particularly
early on in an epidemic, the CFR is the only metric available until the extent of known datadriven biases can be assessed [1,11,12,20-23].
Data quality can affect both the age composition of detected cases and age-specific case-fatality
rates. For instance, counts may be affected by issues like reporting delays or censoring, or by
inconsistent case definitions [1,2,20,21,24]. In many countries, only deaths occurring in hospitals
are being reported in a timely manner [25], underestimating the full death count which would
include deaths at home and in institutions. Deaths may be underestimated because of a lack of
testing both before and after death. Countries might also differ in how they code deaths from
underlying or contributory causes [25]. Excess all-cause mortality compared to a seasonal allcause mortality baseline are suggestive that there is currently considerable underreporting of
COVID-19 deaths, even if some of these deaths might be related to delayed or avoided medical
treatment from other causes of death [26].
The relative importance of both the case age structure and mortality components could also be
affected by comparing countries at different stages of the epidemic. This could result from cases
not being detected at the beginning of the epidemic, or from differences in the lag between

12

infection and death [11,23,27]. Generally, CFRs are highest at the beginning of an infectious
outbreak, when the most serious cases are the most readily detected, and declines as testing
capacity increases and less serious cases are identified [23]. This has notably not been the case
for the COVID-19 epidemic, where the CFR has generally been increasing. Likely this reflects
the success of widespread containment measures enacted in response to increasing caseloads.
Newly identified cases are increasing more slowly than deaths, despite increases in testing
capacity.
The application of the method we present in this paper is not limited to decomposing the current
estimates of CFRs. It can also be applied to CFR estimates which have been corrected for biases,
to infection fatality rates (IFRs) - which estimate the risk of dying from both detected and
undetected cases -, and to excess all-cause weekly mortality counts. Thus, while the data
currently available as input for the decomposition approach might be of varying quality, this is
not a flaw of the method itself. As data quality improves over time and adjustment methods
become available our approach will continue to provide insights into differences and trends in
mortality associated with COVID-19.
Finally, the choice of age groups may have affected our results. If ages were grouped too widely
it might hide actual age-specific case-fatality differences. For instance, if the median age within
the 10-year aggregated age groups that we used differed between populations, this would reduce
the case-age structure explanation and inflate the age-specific mortality explanation. Finally,
there are alternative decomposition techniques that might yield different results. However,
differences are expected to be rather small; indeed, applying the method of Horiuchi and
colleagues [28] to our data yields virtually the same results (results available upon request).
The results of this study add weight to recommendations for data to be disaggregated by age and
potentially other variables to facilitate a better understanding of population-level differences in
CFRs. Equally important will be well designed seroprevalence studies to ascertain the extent to
which our findings are driven by differences in testing regimes, particularly in the diagnosis of
mild and asymptomatic cases. To this extent we are encouraged by the recent announcement that
such a study is being initiated in Germany in line with official WHO recommendations [29,30].

13

Overall, our results show that differences between countries with low and high CFRs can be
driven to a significant extent by the age structure of confirmed cases. Decomposing differences
in case-fatality rates over time or between countries reveals important insights for monitoring the
spread of COVID-19. An accurate assessment of these differences in CFR across countries and
over time are crucial to inform and determine appropriate containment and mitigation
interventions, such as social confinement and mobility restrictions.

A. Details of the decomposition method
A.1 Decomposing CFRs
We want to decompose, or ‚Äúexplain‚Äù, the difference between two CFRs, irrespective of whether they are from
two different populations, or from the same population at two different points in time, or from different
groups within a population, e.g., gender or socio-economic groups. We will use ùê∂ùêπùëÖùëñ and ùê∂ùêπùëÖùëó to distinguish
the two CFRs, e.g., country ùëñ and country ùëó. Moreover, we write ùëÉùëñùëé , ùê∂ùëñùëé , ùëÉùëóùëé , and ùê∂ùëóùëé for the underlying age
compositions and age-specific CFRs; i.e., ùê∂ùêπùëÖùëñ = ‚àëùëÉùëñùëé ùê∂ùëñùëé .
Using a decomposition approach introduced by Kitagawa [6] we separate the difference between two CFRs
into two distinct parts,
ùê∂ùêπùëÖùëñ ‚àí ùê∂ùêπùëÖùëó = ùõº + ùõø,
where ùõº captures the part of the difference between CFRs which is due to differences in the age composition
of cases, and ùõø is due to differences in mortality. ùõº is given by
ùõº = 0.5(ùê∂ùêπùëÖùëñ ‚àí ‚àëùëÉùëóùëé ùê∂ùëñùëé + ‚àëùëÉùëñùëé ùê∂ùëóùëé ‚àí ùê∂ùêπùëÖùëó ),
while ùõø can be calculated as
ùõø = 0.5(ùê∂ùêπùëÖùëñ ‚àí ‚àëùëÉùëñùëé ùê∂ùëóùëé + ‚àëùëÉùëóùëé ùê∂ùëñùëé ‚àí ùê∂ùêπùëÖùëó ).
Note that the age groups for group ùëñ and group ùëó need to be the same. If this is not the case in the raw data
and, for instance, one country reports counts in 5-year age groups (0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, ‚Ä¶) and the other
uses 10-year age groups (0-9, 10-19, ‚Ä¶), then either the more finely grained data needs to be aggregated to
match the coarser data, or the coarser data needs to be adjusted. We choose the latter approach (see
appendix C below).
The intuition behind the formulas is as follows. The first two terms in brackets in the equation for ùõº are
ùê∂ùêπùëÖùëñ ‚àí ‚àëùëÉùëóùëé ùê∂ùëñùëé , or, replacing ùê∂ùêπùëÖùëñ with its definition, ‚àëùëÉùëñùëé ùê∂ùëñùëé ‚àí ‚àëùëÉùëóùëé ùê∂ùëñùëé . The second sum in this expression
captures how high the CFR would have been if group ùëñ had the same age distribution of infections as group ùëó.
The difference to the actual CFR (the whole expression) then captures to what extent the CFR is higher than
this hypothetical CFR because of the actually observed age distribution of detected infections. The third and
the fourth term in brackets in the equation for ùõº are following a similar logic, but using a different
hypothetical comparison, asking how much the CFR of group ùëó would differ if the detected cases had the age
distribution of group ùëñ. The formula for ùõø again follows a similar logic, but now replacing the age-specific
CFRs instead of the age distribution. In summary, to decompose the difference between two CFRs requires
nothing more than the two CFRs themselves as well as a few additional hypothetical CFRs.
To calculate the proportion ùõº and ùõø contribute to the total difference one can use

|ùõº|
|ùõº|+|ùõø|

in case of ùõº and

|ùõø|
|ùõº|+|ùõø|

for the contribution of ùõø .
A.2 Interpretation
As an artificial example, assume that the CFR in country A is equal to 2 percent, while it equals 4 percent in
country B. Subtracting the CFR of country A from country B gives a difference of 2 percentage points. If a large
part of this difference is due to the age structure, then ùõº could be 0.015 and ùõø could be 0.005. These sum to
0.02, or 2 percentage points. If, as another example, two countries have the same age structure of cases, then

18

ùõº will be zero. A similar reasoning holds for ùõø if age-specific CFRs are the same for both countries being
compared. In relative terms, the ùõº -component explains 75 percent of the difference between countries, while
the ùõø -component only explains 25 percent.
The total difference between two CFRs as well as both ùõº and ùõø can be negative. The formulas for the relative
contributions take this into account by using absolute values. If the total difference is positive and either ùõº or
ùõø are negative, it means that the corresponding part of the difference actually reduces the difference between
CFRs. For instance, when comparing the CFR for one country at two points in time, the total difference could
be 0.03; i.e., the CFR increased by three percentage points. If in this case ùõº would be negative, say ‚àí0.01, it
would mean that the age distribution of cases over time became more favorable. ùõø would be 0.04 in this
scenario, and without changes in the age distribution of infections as captured through ùõº , the difference
between CFRs would even have increased by four percentage points.

C. Additional information on data: Age groups
The data we use is provided in different age groups, depending on the country. The following age groups are
used in the original data for both case counts and death counts:
‚Ä¢

China: 0-9, 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 69-69, 70-79, 80+

‚Ä¢

Germany: 0-4, 5-14, 15-34, 35-59, 60-79, 80+

‚Ä¢

Italy: 0-9, 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 69-69, 70-79, 80-89, 90+

‚Ä¢

Spain: 0-9, 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 69-69, 70-79, 80+

‚Ä¢

South Korea: 0-9, 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 69-69, 70-79, 80+

‚Ä¢

United States: 0-19, 20-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, 85+

‚Ä¢

United States (New York City): 0-18, 18-44, 45-64, 65-74, 75+

For the decomposition, the age groups have to match. This is the case for China, Spain, South Korea, and Italy;
in the case of the latter the age categories 80-89 and 90+ have to be merged. The age groups provided for
Germany and the United States are problematic, as they do not match the age groups of any other country.
Aggregating the age groups, as for Italy, does not help, either. For instance, the age category of 20 years to 44
years available for the US cannot be created based on the German data. To deal with this issue, the database
project from which we obtained the case and death counts [9] uses a smoothing approach to estimate counts
for age groups 0-9, 10-19, ‚Ä¶, 80+ [10].
