ABSTRACT

Received: 18 Apr. 2020

Having first reached epidemic proportions in coastal metropolitan areas, COVID-19 has spread around the
country. Reported case rates vary across counties from zero to 126 per thousand population (around a state prison
in the rural county of Trousdale, Tennessee). Overall, rural counties are underrepresented relative to their share
of the population, but a growing proportion of all daily cases and deaths have been reported in rural counties.
This analysis uses daily reports for all counties to present the trends and distribution of COVID-19 cases and
deaths in rural counties, from late March to May 21, 2020. I describe the relationship between population density
and case rates in rural and non-rural counties. Then I focus on noteworthy outbreaks linked to prisons, meat and
poultry plants, and nursing homes, many of which are linked to high concentrations of Hispanic, American
Indian, and Black populations. The growing epidemic in rural counties is apparently driven by outbreaks
concentrated in these institutional settings, which are conducive to transmission. The impact of the epidemic in
rural areas may be heightened due to their weaker health infrastructure and more vulnerable populations,
especially due to age, socioeconomic status, and health conditions. As a result, the epidemic may contribute to
the ongoing decline of health, economic, and social conditions in rural areas.

INTRODUCTION
After spreading around the country for at least four months
(CDC, 2020), COVID-19 cases remain unevenly distributed
geographically, with 193 of the 3,143 counties reporting no
cases, the average county reporting 2.1 cases per thousand,
and the maximum as high as 125 per thousand - in Trousdale
County, Tennessee, where an outbreak at the state prison
drove the epidemic (Bosman et al., 2020b). Although the U.S.
epidemic has had its greatest impact in coastal urban areas, it
is increasingly reaching into rural areas. In this paper I
describe the spread of reported COVID-19 cases and deaths
into rural counties of the United States, with attention to
race/ethnic composition, population density, and institutional
factors.
The COVID-19's effect on rural areas may exacerbate
existing health disparities in the U.S. (Dorn et al., 2020).
Although we would expect lower transmission rates in rural
areas, because of lower population density, there also may be
higher rates of serious complications and death because of
their older age profile, poorer health status, and degraded
health care infrastructure (Ameh et al., 2020; Cafer and
Rosenthal, 2020). The context of urban-rural health disparity,

and disparities within rural areas, are important to understand
the impact of the epidemic in rural areas.
Health disparities between rural and urban areas in the U.S.
are wide and growing wider (James and Cossman, 2017; Singh
et al., 2017). Rural residents are older, have lower average
educational attainment, and have lower incomes, than urban
residents. And there are substantial disparities within the rural
population, with Black, Hispanic, and American Indian
populations having worse social and economic conditions than
non-Hispanic Whites. Concurrently, rural ethnic minorities
are more likely to report poorer health status, lack of access to
medical care, and higher prevalence of chronic health
problems (James et al., 2017). Rural residents also have less
access to reliable health information, both from service
providers and from media sources (Chen et al., 2019), and are
less likely to use health information technology (Greenberg et
al., 2018). These disadvantages in U.S. rural areas suggest the
possibility of serious impact of the COVID-19 epidemic,
despite the advantage of lower population density for
transmission rates. And within rural areas, we need to assess
disparate impacts by race/ethnicity and social class.
In addition, three specific institutional settings in which
the epidemic has surged in the rural U.S. deserve special
attention: meat and poultry processing plants, prisons, and

nursing homes and long-term care facilities. By April 28, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported
results from a voluntary survey of correctional and detention
facilities, which yielded responses from 37 jurisdictions. In
these facilities, there were about 4,900 COVID-19 confirmed
cases among prisoners, as well as 2,800 among their staffs,
leading to more than 100 deaths. The outbreaks are apparently
fueled by crowding, close quarters, lack of testing and medical
isolation facilities, turnover among prisoners, and continuous
entry and exit by staff (Wallace, 2020). Some of the biggest
prison outbreaks of COVID-19 have been in rural areas,
including the one in Trousdale County, Tennessee.
By April 27, 2020, CDC reported almost 5,000 cases of
COVID-19 at 115 meat and poultry processing facilities in 19
states, affecting plants that employ more than one-fifth of the
industry. At the extreme, one plant reported an 18 percent
infection rate among its workers (Dyal, 2020). CDC suggested
that the close proximity, physical exertion, fast work pace, and
lack of adequate disinfecting were likely contributors to the
outbreaks. Workers have reported unsafe working conditions
and failure to implement steps need to reduce transmission in
plants (Laughland and Holpuch, 2020). At the end of April,
President Trump ordered meat processing plants to remain
open (White House, 2020), even as the union representing the
most workers in the industry, the United Food and Commercial
Workers International Union, called for heightened safety
enforcement and testing in the plants nationwide (UFCW,
2020). Many affected meat and poultry processing facilities are
in rural areas, as shown in the examples below.
The CDC has not yet reported on the epidemic's impact on
nursing homes, but media aggregations of state health
authorities indicate more than 20,000 people have died in
nursing homes nationally (Into America, 2020). Again, the
rural/urban distribution of these cases is not yet known, but
some nursing home outbreaks are apparent in the county case
reports I provide below. In addition to these settings, early
rural outbreaks apparently stemmed from tourism or seasonal
housing (Carson, 2020). However, those outbreaks were
overtaken by larger outbreaks in the institutional settings
described here.
At this point we do not yet have the data necessary to parse
the relative contribution of each of these settings to the overall
COVID-19 epidemic in rural areas. However, this descriptive
review of the case and death data, with an informal survey of
pubic reports, indicates the potential importance of these
institutional settings.
The early months of the COVID-19 epidemic have revealed
a disparate impact on Black, Hispanic, and American Indian
communities (Almagro and Orane-Hutchinson, 2020; Dyer,
2020; Kovich, 2020; Solis et al., 2020). In some rural cases,
there is likely an overlap between race/ethnic composition and
the institutional factors described here. For example, the
concentration of Black prisoners in rural prisons and Hispanic
workers in meat processing plants. In the absence of the data

necessary to draw these connections systematically, I use
race/ethnic concentration to look for patterns across counties.
In the descriptive analysis that follows, I present the trends
and distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths in rural
counties, from late March to May 21, 2020, the latest data
available. I describe the relationship between population
density and case rates in rural and non-rural counties. Then I
focus on noteworthy outbreaks linked to prisons, meat plants,
and nursing homes - and associated with high concentrations
of Hispanic, American Indian, and Black populations.

DATA AND MATERIALS
COVID-19 data are drawn from the database maintained by
the New York Times (2020), which is updated daily with reports
from public health authorities around the country. The data
reported at the county level used here include the number of
new confirmed (or presumed) cases and deaths each day in
each county.1 County population data, including race/ethnic
composition, are 2018 estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau
(2020). Rurality is drawn from the 2010 Decennial Census,
from which the Census Bureau reported the percentage of each
the population in each county that lived in a rural area
(Ratcliffe et al., 2016). I follow the Bureau's categorization of
counties as (1) completely rural (100 percent), (2) mostly rural
(50-99.9 percent), and (3) mostly urban (less than 50 percent
rural). In the text I refer to counties with 50 percent or more
rural population as "rural." I calculate county population
density as residents per square mile, using the Census Bureau's
(2019) estimates of land area.2
Finally, for counties with large COVID-19 outbreaks, I used
Internet searching, mostly relying on local or national news
sources, to identify likely centers for the outbreak. Most of
these are easily identified, as when the state authorities in
Tennessee listed some 1300 cases over several days at the state
prison in Trousdale County. I was unable to find a clearly
identified source in only one prominent case: Sullivan County,
NY, with about 1300 cases. In most rural counties with large
outbreaks, local or national media have published news reports
about the institutional settings where the outbreak began.
This is much easier to identify than in urban areas, where there
are many large institutions with overlapping population
exposures. Nevertheless, these place notes remain informal
identifiers of likely centers of the disease. Note also that the
outbreaks in these counties, and the case counts I provide, are
not limited to people within these institutions, as they also
include people in the surrounding communities within each
county.
The data for this paper is from publicly available sources.
The code is written in Stata (using the maptile program for
maps). The code is available here: https://osf.io/wd2n6/,
including links to all data used.

The New York Times created two aggregate counties, for New York City (combining the five borough-counties) and Kansas City, Missouri (where
the portions of Cass, Clay, Jackson and Platte counties in the municipality of Kansas City are combined into one). Both of these are non-rural
counties, so they have little effect on this analysis.

Two counties, Oglala Lakota, SD, and the Kusilvak Census Area, AK, are not included in the Census file. I retrieved their land areas from
Wikipedia.

RESULTS
By May 21, 2020, there were 1.6 million confirmed or
presumed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., and about 94,000
deaths (Table 1). Case and death rates were highest in urban
counties (less than 50 percent rural). Rural counties recorded
about 91,000 cases and about 3,800 deaths, the great majority

of them in the mostly rural category (50-99 percent rural).
From Table 1, we can see that the rural counties (both
categories combined) account for 13 percent of the population,
6.2 percent of cases and 4.3 percent of deaths.
Figure 1 uses county maps to show the distribution of rural
cases across the country. Panel A shows the count of cases
reported by county, which ranges from 0 to 2,044. The greatest
numbers are in the Southwest (American Indian reservation

areas), the South and Mid-Atlantic (from Louisiana to
Maryland), Michigan, and New England. The upper Midwest
and West have much lower numbers of rural cases. Panel B
shows the same case count expressed in terms of cases per
1,000 population. This shows that the Mid-Atlantic, Michigan,
and New England rural counties, although reporting many
cases, do not have the highest rates per capita. The per capita
map isolates counties in the Southwest, South, and Midwest
that, as we will see, are sites outbreaks in prisons, meat or
poultry processing plants, or nursing homes.
It is not surprising that rural counties are
underrepresented in reported COVID-19 case and death rates,
because community transmission of the disease was first
identified in coastal urban areas where people had traveled
from Europe and China (Zimmer, 2020). Not only were rural
counties less likely to host the initial vectors of the disease,
they also have lower population density and fewer face-to-face
interactions, offering less opportunity for viral transmission.
However, once establishing a foothold in some rural areas, the
virus has spread robustly and their share of the epidemic has
increased.
Figure 2 shows the number of new cases and deaths
reported each day in rural counties, from the last week of
March to mid-May, on a log scale (panel A), and the share of
new cases and deaths each day that are in rural areas (panel B).
Both panels present the data smoothed using seven-day
trailing averages. As the epidemic slowed in much of the
country in early May, including major metropolitan areas such
as New York and Detroit (Bosman et al., 2020a), the pace of
new reports of cases and deaths in rural areas did not slow, at
more than 2,000 and just under 100 per day respectively. New
cases and deaths in rural counties, as a share of the U.S. total,
increased substantially over this period.
3

The dynamics of rural transmission are naturally different
from those in urban areas, where there is more face-to-face
interaction, denser housing, larger institutions, mass
transportation, and larger social events. With a similar level of
initial infection, transmission occurs more efficiently in areas
of denser population (RocklÃ¶v and SjÃ¶din, 2020.). To explore
differences in transmission patterns between rural and urban
areas, Figure 3 presents the relationship between COVID-19
cases per capita and population density (residents per 100
square miles), with both measures logged and including only
those counties with any reported cases. The overall slope
(weighted by population) is .35. However, the slope is steeper
among urban (.37) than among rural (.20) counties (the slopes,
and the difference between, them are highly significant
statistically). Although only suggestive, this distinction might
imply that rural outbreaks of the epidemic are more driven by
idiosyncratic circumstances (such as the presence of a prison,
meat plant, or nursing home); while transmission in urban
outbreaks is generated by interactions across a wider set of
social settings, determined in greater part by the level
population density.
Rather than relying on overall population density to
achieve viral transmission, in rural areas it appears the novel
coronavirus spreads most successfully through pockets of
dense and vulnerable populations within confined
institutional settings. A prison in a rural area gains none of the
protections of looser population concentration that benefit
the wider community. Figure 4 shows the growth of outbreaks,
by county, associated with the three types of institutions
described above: prisons, meat and poultry processing plants,
and nursing homes. 3 (Again, the categorization of these
outbreaks is drawn from my reading of local and national news

I include with nursing homes one outbreak, in East Feliciana, LA, apparently associated with a state mental hospital.

reports or public health authorities, and may not be definitive.)
Of these, counties with prison outbreaks (panel A) report the
greatest number of cases (note the y-axis scales differ across
panels). 4 The prison-involved counties also demonstrate a
4

disturbing pattern of suddenly reporting hundreds of cases at
once, which implies their testing regimes or reporting
practices are not adequately capturing the true pattern of
infection. Although not a comprehensive accounting of rural

Outbreaks in the counties listed are all associated with state prisons, except Pike, PA, which involves an ICE detention facility.

outbreaks, the 30 counties shown in Figure 4, and listed in
Table 2, together account for 15 percent of all reported rural
cases, and represent the largest rural outbreaks, with the
exception of those around the Navajo, Zuni, Hopi, and Fort
Apache reservations, which account for an additional 4,064
cases.
Finally, I present rural COVID-19 outbreaks according to
the race/ethnic composition of their counties. This makes clear
that some of the outbreak counties describe above are outliers
not only with regard to their number of cases, but also with
regard to high minority population concentration. Figure 5
shows rural counties and their COVID-19 case counts by
population percent Hispanic (panel A), American Indian (B),
and Black (C), with select counties labeled for exposition. The
overall relationship between case count and percent minority
is strongest for Black population (not shown), but in all three
cases there are clear outlier cases comprising severe rural
outbreaks in counties with disproportionate minority
populations.

DISCUSSION
At this writing, rural U.S. counties account for less of the
COVID-19 outbreak than their share of the population,
reflecting the epidemic's initial explosion in coastal urban
areas and the greater propensity for transmission in places

with greater population density. However, the share of cases
and deaths in rural counties is rising, apparently driven by
outbreaks concentrated in institutional settings conducive to
transmission: prisons, meat and poultry processing facilities,
and nursing homes. In addition to the institutional factors, the
impact of the epidemic in rural areas may be heightening due
to their weaker health infrastructure and more vulnerable
populations, especially due to age, socioeconomic status, and
health conditions. As a result, the epidemic may contribute to
the ongoing decline of health, economic, and social conditions
in rural areas (Ajilore, 2020).
There are several notable weaknesses to this analysis. First,
it relies on officially reported COVID-19 cases and deaths,
which are dependent on laboratory testing and subject to
underreporting (Lipsitch et al., 2020). People who administer
institutions such as prisons, factories, and nursing homes are
often motivated to downplay the severity of their outbreaks,
even if they have the resources necessary to track them.
Second, my notes on selected county cases are not a substitute
for more systematic analysis. Subsequent analysis may
examine the association of cases with the presence of these
institutions more systematically, using databases of their
locations. Finally, more systematic analysis will require
consideration of all-cause mortality, which allow a more
holistic assessment of the full impact of COVID-19's epidemic
in rural counties (Goldstein and Lee, 2020).
