Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns are creating health and economic crises
that threaten food and nutrition security. The seafood sector provides important sources of
employment and nutrition, especially in low-income countries, and is highly globalized, allowing
shocks to propagate internationally. We use a resilience ‘action cycle’ framework to study the
first five months of COVID-19-related disruptions, impacts, and responses to the seafood sector.
Looking across high- and low-income countries, we find that some supply chains, market
segments, companies, small-scale actors and civil society have shown initial signs of greater
resilience than others. For example, frozen Ecuadorian shrimp and Chinese tilapia exports were
diverted to alternative markets, while live-fresh supply chains were more impacted. COVID-19
has also highlighted the vulnerability of certain groups working in- or dependent on the seafood
sector. We discuss early coping and adaptive responses, combined with lessons from past shocks,
that could be considered when building resilience in the sector.

The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns are creating health and economic crises,
leading to increasing incidence of poverty 1 and a looming food crisis 2,3. The food system has
been seriously disrupted with impacts occurring at multiple levels and across supply chains 4.
Studying these impacts identifies vulnerabilities within the food system as well as opportunities
for governments, international bodies, industries, small-scale actors, and civil society to respond,
adapt, and build resilience to future shocks. Seafood is highly traded, both globally 5 and
regionally 6, and composed of many species and production and distribution strategies. Much can
be learned about food systems in pandemics by studying COVID-19-related shocks and
responses in the seafood sector.
The current pandemic began in China, the world’s largest producer, consumer, and
exporter of seafood 7. As the pandemic spreads, a patchwork of impacts and responses are
occurring across this sector. Strategies to absorb shocks, react, and restore the functions of the
seafood sector are critical. Hundreds of millions of people rely on seafood for their livelihood,
culture, and food and nutrition security 8 including women, migrant workers and young people,
and a large informal sector 9 that may not see direct aid from governments or financial
institutions.
In order to rebuild toward a more resilient food system, it is necessary to understand the
scope of recent disruptions, impacts, and range of responses. We applied a food system resilience
action cycle framework (Fig. 1) 10 as informed by concepts of coping, adaptation 11, and
specified vs. general resilience 12. We use the term resilience to mean the “capacity over time of
a food system and its units at multiple levels, to provide sufficient, appropriate and accessible
food to all, in the face of various and even unforeseen disturbances” 10. Using these concepts, we
ask three central questions: First, how has the seafood system been impacted by COVID-19?
Second, what types of responses have occurred thus far to absorb and react to COVID-19
disruptions and what actions have been taken to restore system functions? Third, what lessons
from current and past shock events can help to inform actors and institutions as they build
resilience to future shocks? The period of study was the first five months of the pandemic, from
January through May 2020.
Disruptions from COVID-19 to the seafood system
Published data across news, social media outlets, governments, and development partners
provide an emergent picture of disruptions or shocks to multiple stages of supply chains (Fig. 2).
These disruptions caused a generalizable range of impacts across different subsectors, product
forms, markets, and consumer segments. Impacts from the pandemic were felt first in China and
among its trading partners (Fig. 3), but quickly spread around the world. In some cases,
disruptions occurred simultaneously to multiple stages of a supply chain. In other cases, the
impacts propagated out as a pressure wave ahead of COVID-19 cases, causing second order
impacts following shifts in trade. We also expect lagged impacts caused by high uncertainty
about future demand or disruptions to production inputs that have yet to be realized. Disruptions
in some regions or sectors are being magnified by existing stressors such as climate change,
natural hazards (Pacific cyclone season, African locust season), resource management, and
political or economic instability. Below we use data to discuss specific disruptions to seafood
demand, distribution, labor, and production.

3

Demand disruptions. The first demand impacts were experienced in China in late January and
early February 2020, as lockdowns caused domestic seafood trade to drop precipitously with
high-value marine fish species sold at restaurants more impacted than lower value farmed carp
sold at retail outlets (Fig. 4a). Lower consumer demand in China led to reduced import volumes,
however, as the pandemic subsided within China, seafood imports and domestic carp sales
rebounded (Fig. 4a, 4b). In high-income countries, such as the United States (U.S.) there was a
dramatic shift in all food sourcing favoring retail over restaurants due to public health measures
to reduce COVID-19 spread (Fig. 4c). As restaurants typically sell more expensive live and fresh
seafood, restaurant closures constrained markets for these products. In the European Union,
lower demand at restaurants led to a 30% drop in imported live-fresh seafood prices (Fig. 4d).
In low income food deficit countries, such as Ethiopia, public health interventions
reduced household incomes, which translated into reduced expenditures on nutrient dense foods
that, if sustained, could lead to malnutrition 13. As COVID-19 spreads poverty and hunger will
continue to be concerns in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) 14.
Distribution disruptions. Seafood trade was disrupted, redirected, or halted by sudden shifts in
demand, supply, and limits on the movement of goods and people. Many of the earliest trade
impacts radiated out from China (Fig. 3). In January 2020, China banned imports of live animals
which impacted trade of live lobsters from many countries (Fig. 3). Some ports were closed for
quarantine, which forced cargo ships to reroute and increased congestion at other ports, or
shipments were cancelled entirely 15. Cancelled international passenger flights created logistical
problems and increased air freight costs for high-value seafood products such as farmed Atlantic
salmon 16. Cancelled shipments left producers and distributors without a market for perishable
products or with a shortage of freezer space. In some cases, distributors were able to shift trade
to other markets, such as frozen Ecuadorian shrimp re-routed from China to the U.S. and Europe
in January through March 2020, and then back to China in April 2020 (Fig. 4e). Norwegian
salmon was redirected from China to other countries such as the U.S. and Brazil 17, without a
significant change in volume or price (Fig. 4f). As shifts to retail purchases occurred in the U.S.,
China dramatically increased exports of higher priced processed tilapia products to these
valuable markets (Fig. 4g, 4h).
Trade disruptions have secondary impacts on LMICs that are more distributed. For
example, the diversion of China’s farmed tilapia to North America corresponded with a drop in
exports to some countries, notably a 50% drop in exports to developing countries in April, 2020.
The drop in Chinese tilapia initially opened up markets to local fishers around Lake Victoria 18,
however, this short-term benefit was dampened as the Kenyan government introduced curfews to
control the spread of COVID-19. Curfews decreased night-fishing activity for both expensive
export products (e.g., Nile Perch) and affordable nutritious small fish for local consumption (e.g.,
Dagaa)19, which along with trade shifts, increased price volatility 20. Tilapia farms on Lake
Victoria suffered disrupted feed supplies and responded to increased demand for smaller fish and
expanded market opportunities outside of the capital.
Labor disruptions. Lockdowns disrupted employment in seafood supply chains for workers,
and access to labor for seafood businesses. In many low-income food deficit countries, farms and
enterprises in food supply chains provide self-employment and casual work for many people.
COVID-19 policy responses impacting the operation of such businesses resulted in lowered
incomes and caused substantial unemployment 21. Migrant fish workers were not able to leave

4

fishing boats in India, ports in Thailand, or an Ecuadorian fishing vessel in the South Pacific, and
closures of fish markets have rendered many fish workers jobless 22,23. India’s nationwide
lockdown also forced the closure of hatcheries, feed mills and processing plants, and sharp drop
in demand from the U.S. and Europe reduced international exports of frozen shrimp, which
account for 70% of India seafood exports. Similar impacts have been reported in Bangladesh and
Myanmar 23. COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred among seafood process workers in Ghana 24,
the U.S. 25, and elsewhere, as well as other animal processing plants 26, indicating this is not
unique to seafood processing.
Production disruptions. Seafood production decreases have sometimes occurred in parallel
with COVID-19 cases and at other times lagged reductions in consumer demand. COVID-19related lockdowns have decreased industrial fishing efforts in China, Spain, France, and Italy by
40% to >50% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019 27. Reductions in Pacific tuna fishing
are due to port closures and a lack of fisheries observers, while coastal subsistence fishing has
increased 28. Other fisheries have been unaffected thus far; Alaska pollock fishing and processing
vessels were at sea before U.S. lockdowns were enacted 29. However, uncertainty remains about
upcoming fishing seasons, and in Alaska, where the salmon fishery is highly dependent on
seasonal workers, production may be limited by restrictions on immigrant labor.
Aquaculture production has been disrupted as farmers decide whether to restock given
uncertainty over demand. For example, as of April 2002, shrimp farmers across Southeast Asia
have stopped stocking ponds 30, in some cases due to difficulty importing broodstock, which will
produce lagged reductions in supply. Species with long grow-out periods, such as shellfish and
salmon, can be held in the water until markets improve, but not indefinitely and not without
economic costs. This range of impacts across the supply chain has been met with diverse
responses deployed by governments, the seafood industry, and consumers.
Reactive actions to COVID-19 by seafood system actors and institutions.
We explore the reactive actions taken by multiple actors and institutions in response to COVID19 through May 2020. These include initial steps to absorb and react to disruptions, and to
restore functions to the seafood system (Fig. 1). We categorized these actions as short-term
coping and forward-looking adaptive responses. To date, responses have mostly aimed to 1)
protect public health, including the health of fishery sector workers, 2) support those whose
enterprises, jobs, and incomes are affected by COVID-19 related disruptions; and 3) maintain
seafood supplies to consumers. Initial coping responses, in particular by governments, sought to
maintain the sector’s core functions through the period of wide-spread economic disruption,
while protecting the most vulnerable. Longer-term adaptive measures, that often emerge outside
of government, can contribute to building COVID-19-specific and generalized resilience to
multiple shocks and stressors. Below we discuss specific responses by different actors and
institutions which is summarized in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1 with expanded countryspecific examples.
Governments and development partners. Governments have different capacities and
tendencies to respond and, when responding, have exposed intensifying tensions between public
health measures to limit COVID-19 infections and preventing an economic crisis
(Supplementary Table 1). Consequently, most government actions represent short-term coping
strategies to address immediate challenges posed by the crisis. For example, early on, many

5

governments, including those in Russia, Canada, and South Africa 31-33, designated fishers, fish
farmers, and fish processors as “essential workers” allowing them to operate in order to maintain
the food supply. Along with these actions, protective measures were taken to safeguard worker
health (Table 1). These were coupled with social protections to lessen the socioeconomic toll of
the pandemic and keep companies going, with efforts to distribute the funds equitably varying in
their levels of success 34,35.
Development partners including non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have also acted
to support governments in dealing with the immediate impacts of COVID-19. Their actions
comprise adaptive responses that can form the basis for building resilience. They targeted
countries and regions where governments had limited capacity to implement social and economic
measures seen elsewhere. For example, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
and WorldFish are providing policy recommendations, technical advice, and support and/or
harnessing research to guide government responses 23,36. The World Bank is providing grants and
loans to countries to assess impacts and develop responses.
Large-scale commercial sector responses. Responses to the pandemic from the industrialized
sector have been rapid, detecting early signs of weaknesses in global seafood markets and
making resources available to rapidly adjust marketing and distribution. Early coping responses
focused on protecting worker health, consumer health, and securing production and supply
chains during the pandemic (Supplementary Table 1). Nevertheless, some seafood workers
remained exposed to outbreaks 24,25. The economic response has included reducing the
workforce, but some companies have also responded by shifting into or strengthening their
positions in retail and online markets, where consumer demand has been high; the ability to
make such transitions could represent longer-term adaptation. Companies selling frozen and
shelf-stable products as well as companies with strong relationships with retailers have been
particularly well positioned to adapt sales from the restaurant sector to retail markets. Use of
technology such as IT has facilitated these advantages, allowing companies to promote their
products and connect with consumers (Supplementary Table 1).
Small scale-sector and non-governmental organization responses. Small-scale fisher
responses to the pandemic have predominantly comprised actions that can translate into longerterm adaptive strategies that build resilience. Early on, some small-scale fish worker networks,
which are often global with strongholds in LMICs such as India or South Africa, mobilized to
share information, document impacts, and advocate for government resources 37. Others
formulated recommendations to fight against COVID-19 and improve the working conditions of
artisanal fisheries with a specific focus on women 38, who represent a large share of the total
workforce 39. In some cases, producer organizations have bought back fish from their members
by applying the withdrawal price — a minimum price guaranteed throughout the year even in the
absence of demand. Artisanal fishers and small holders have also turned to food banks and other
forms of food sharing to distribute the catch 40,41. Some NGOs are working with local fishers and
women fish workers to connect catch to private households to support direct marketing of
catches that would otherwise go unsold. There has also been a surge in direct producer-toconsumer sales. User traffic on the Local Catch Network in the U.S. was up by 310% from
March 15, 2020 to May 14, 2020 compared to the previous year.

Consumer responses. Consumer response has been largely conditioned by public health
measures that have confined people to their homes. Early responses included panic buying, a
shift from restaurants to retail purchases and home delivery and local seafood purchasing 42.
Consumers in high-income countries have focused on buying seafood products with longer shelflife and frozen products, while in low income food deficit countries there are early examples of
reduced household income leading to shifts towards staple foods and away from nutrient dense
foods 13. There has also been some concern about the safety of seafood but others have
responded that there is no connection between seafood and COVID-19 43.
Learning and building resilience to future shocks
COVID-19 has exposed vulnerabilities and power imbalances in the food system, as well as
highlighted broader inequalities and health disparities across society 44,45. Coping and adaptive
measures represent early responses during the first five months of the COVID-19 pandemic.
While short-term coping will remain important as the pandemic spreads and possibly re-emerges
in countries, actors and institutions within the seafood sector can carry adaptive responses
forward and engage in a process of learning and building robustness to prevent future shocks
(Fig 1). Based on the literature and findings from this study, we provide three key concepts to
guide this ‘adaptive cycle’ process.
Identify resilience, vulnerability, and power imbalances in seafood systems. The seafood
system is a meshed network of formal and informal producers and distributors, retailers, and
consumers. Some supply chains, market segments, companies, small-scale actors and civil
society have shown initial signs of greater resilience than others. In high-income countries, food
retailers and supply chains selling shelf-stable and frozen seafood have done well following
COVID-19-related shifts in food sourcing, while live-fresh and high-value producers selling to
restaurants were particularly hard hit. A surge in direct producer-to-consumer sales in the U.S.
may foretell a longer-term shift in consumer purchasing habits. Conversely, in many LICs, such
as India, the informal sector was particularly hard hit by restrictive government responses to the
crisis that prevented many actors from engaging in their livelihood activities 46, which could lead
to less household income and decreased food security.
Maintaining and building diversity and connectivity at the community, company, and
country level are ways to build resilience and guard against bad outcomes. Communities with
diverse networks, such as in Mexico, were able to mobilize for support in the form of food aid
and relief 47. Strengthening local food systems, for example in India, is another way to build
resilience in communities 48. Companies with diverse portfolios and connections to more markets
could more easily switch between commodities or divert products at a global scale (e.g.
Ecuadorian shrimp, Chinese tilapia) thus enabling them to continue their business. Diversity and
connectivity to markets at the country-level enables continuous supply of seafood.
Many countries, however, are increasingly reliant on food imports from a shrinking
number of exporters 49, which makes them more vulnerable to disruptions. The tendency towards
concentration in the seafood sector creates power imbalances that risk undermining food security
in low-income countries and communities 50. Companies and countries that were able to
diversify and adapt did so, in some cases, by exposing other aspects of the global system (e.g.,
low-value markets in low-income food deficit countries) to trade shocks. Efforts to build
resilience following COVID-19 should consider resilience to what?, for whom?, and for what
purpose? 11, and be attentive to the possibility of propagated impacts from these decisions.

7

Transition from short-term coping to longer-term adaptation. As the pandemic shifts and
possibly re-emerges in countries, there will be continuing need for coping responses to maintain
the sector’s core functions and protect vulnerable populations working in- or dependent on the
seafood sector. Some coping responses, such as removing normal restrictions on fishing or
increasing fishing quotas, which result in over-harvesting, may be maladaptive or have
unintended consequences that undermine the resilience of the seafood system in the long-term.
Responses will vary across regions and countries reflecting the different levels of economic,
social, and political capital available to address the impacts across sectors in the seafood system,
as well as the nature of the labor market. Informally employed workers, many of whom are
women and migrants and are especially prevalent in Asia and Africa, are often omitted from
social protection schemes and other entitlements.
A key transition point for actors in the seafood sector, and other food sectors, will be
knowing when to shift from short-term coping strategies to the development and implementation
of longer-term adaptation strategies and resilience building that is necessary to prevent future
shocks and respond to ongoing stressors such as climate change or political instability. These
shifts will be staggered in time as the pandemic progresses through countries and regions of the
world. An additional consideration is how specialized adaptations should be, because increasing
resilience of the seafood sector to future pandemics may reduce general resilience to an unknown
array of future shocks 12. Lastly, the United Nations recommends using the COVID-19 shock as
an opportunity to transform the food system to be more green, inclusive, and resilient 51. The
idea of shocks as “windows of opportunity” to engage in transformations is a key feature of
resilience thinking 12. The current seafood system does not work for all people; it falls short in
addressing concerns over environmental sustainability 52, social equity 53, or nutrition security 54.
Returning to ‘business as usual’ following this shock would be missing an opportunity to ‘build
forward better’.
Avoid mistakes of past responses. While COVID-19 presents a somewhat novel shock to the
seafood sector in terms of magnitude, extent of supply chain influence, and global scope,
previous shocks offer useful lessons. Three key lessons relate to trade restrictions,
overstimulating production, and food prices and aid.
First, to avoid propagating shocks through trade, as occurred in the 2008 grain crisis,
countries should maintain food supply buffers and cooperate internationally to avoid export bans
and hoarding behavior 55-57. As of mid-April, 20 countries representing 5% of the global calorie
market had implemented restrictions on food exports, mainly for cereals and grains, and limited
restrictions on animal products (eggs, chickens) 58. While these actions have seemingly not
triggered a cascading crisis, seafood flows were disrupted with impacts worse in some areas than
others, and additional stressors such as a recession or future waves of COVID-19 could worsen
the situation.
Second, surges in fishing effort in Europe after WWII 59 or more recently in Sri Lanka
following the 2004 tsunami 60 led to overfishing. As governments and industries try to reboot
the economy in the coming period, there is a risk of overstimulating production in some regions
and fisheries, which could harm fish populations and the marine environment. Related to
overfishing is the need to continue tracking lapses in monitoring, enforcement, and observers
aboard vessels as they could lead to illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing and
subsequent environmental impacts 41.

8

Third, during past shocks, the quality of the diet often suffers as families shift purchasing
behavior to less expensive staple foods. For example, during the 1997-8 Asian financial crisis in
Indonesia, households were largely able to maintain calorie intake, but anemia rates rose
following decreased consumption of micronutrient rich foods (e.g., eggs, meat, fish) due to high
prices 61. This is confirmed in Bangladesh, where maintaining low staple food prices can benefit
lower income consumers by freeing up money to access fish and other pricier foods 62. It is
estimated that the COVID-19 pandemic could double the number of people who are acutely
hungry, from 130 million currently to 265 million 3. Understanding the complex interplay
between household income, food prices, and access for staple foods and micronutrient dense
foods (including fish) can help governments and institutions better respond to current and future
shocks.
This paper describes disruptions to- and responses by actors at multiple levels in the seafood
system to fast moving, continually evolving shocks that have a direct impact on livelihoods,
economies, food and nutrition security. We use a resilience ‘action cycle’ framework to study the
first five months of COVID-19-related disruptions, impacts, and responses to the seafood sector.
As the pandemic continues to spread there is much we need to learn, and we propose a series of
immediate and longer-term research needs to guide strategic research investments (Table 2).
COVID-19 has also highlighted the vulnerability of certain groups working in- or dependent on
the seafood sector. Early coping and adaptive responses, combined with lessons from past
shocks, should be considered when building resilience in the sector.
Methods
Data. Seafood production, trade, and retail sales were collected from March 28 to June 2, 2020
from national government agencies and market reporting companies. Data sources include the
following: China domestic fish sales 63 and imports 64, European Union seafood imports 65, U.S.
reservations for >20,000 restaurants 66, U.S. retail food sales using an aggregate of six major
food groups 67, U.S. national food expenditures by food source 68, Ecuador shrimp exports 69,
Norway farmed salmon exports 70, and international trade data (i.e., United Nations Comtrade)
71
. These data include the volume and/or value of seafood published on a weekly or monthly
basis for the period of January 1, 2018 through April 30, 2020. Year-over-year percent change
was calculated as the current trade volume (for a week or a month) minus the previous year’s
volume divided by the previous year’s volume times 100. Prices were converted to U.S. dollars
per kg and calculated as the total value divided by the total volume for a time period.
Reported impacts and responses on the seafood sector were compiled from April 3 to
May 30, 2020, which includes (n = 175) articles published from January 28 to May 27, 2020.
News articles were collected by monitoring Google News alerts for ("seafood" OR "fish") AND
("COVID-19" OR "covid"), daily data scraping of Twitter posts for "seafood" and "COVID-19"
OR "covid," website searches of primary seafood industry news outlets (e.g., Seafood Source,
Undercurrent, and IntraFish), and compiling information shared through the authors’
professional networks. All news articles containing information about an impact on or response
to the COVID-19 pandemic relating to any stage of the seafood supply chain were considered
relevant. For each post, we extracted information on the date of the article, date of the reported
impact, the type of impact, reported countries, sector(s), supply chain stage(s), species/taxa, and
product form(s) involved. The extracted data and links to original news articles are available

9

through the COVID-19 Seafood Impacts database 72. While this database is not intended to
represent a complete accounting of all impacts and responses, it does represent a sampling of the
early impacts and responses across small-scale and industrial production, wild-capture and
aquaculture systems, all supply chain stages, and over 40 high- and low-income
countries/territories.
Examples of responses were drawn from the database 72 as well as emerging policy
statements and technical reports published by governments and development partners during our
study period to create Tables 1 and Supporting Information Table S1. Utilizing these latter
sources, enabled us to rapidly evaluate early responses and strategies around the world and
across sectors in the seafood supply chain. Responses and strategies were inventoried and then
organized thematically using an iterative and inductive approach as new information became
available.
Terms and definitions. We distinguish between specified resilience (specific to one type of
shock) and general resilience to a range of shocks and stressors (e.g., economic, political,
climatic, or biotic) 12. For either dimension, ‘building resilience’ can be an explicit goal of
seafood system governance in the future. When considering responses to shocks, we refer to
coping as short-term reactive measures that cannot be sustained for long periods and adapting as
longer-term and planned change in practices 11.

Tables and Figures
Table 1. Reactive actions to COVID-19 by seafood system actors and institutions. (See
Supplementary Table 1 for country-specific examples and references.)
Governments and Development Partners
Health and safety responses to protect public health, as well as safety and working
conditions for fishers and fish farmers, including through the use of technologies
Social protection and employment response including non-contributory assistance
programs (one-off cash transfer, food distribution), social insurance (e.g.
unemployment benefits) and labor market interventions (e.g. wage subsidies) to
mitigate short-term impacts. These responses differ according to national fiscal
policies.
Economic responses to provide emergency assistance including aid, reallocation of
financial resources, loans and subsidies to mitigate the short-term impacts of the
crisis on commercial fisheries and aquaculture. These responses have been observed
in both high- and low-income countries, but appear to be significantly larger in high
income countries. In both, challenges have been reported in accessing funds,
especially for small holders and the informal sector.
Management measures and other technical responses to respond to the impacts
of COVID-19 on commercial fisheries and aquaculture
Large-Scale Commercial Fisheries and Aquaculture
Health and safety responses to ensure the health and safety of workers along the
supply chain as well as social support to national efforts
Social protection and industry responses, including advocating for and pursuing
social protections and reducing workforce in response to diminished demand and/or
changes in the marketplace
Economic responses targeting retail and consumer markets, including online and
home delivery
Small-Scale Sector and Non-Governmental Organizations
Health and safety responses, including arrangements and information to support
and strengthen communities and vulnerable populations

15

Social protection and sector responses, including collective action and networking
within or across small-scale fishing sector as well as fish workers and small fish
farmers to maintain safe employment opportunities
Economic responses via local and seafood direct marketing
Consumers
Shift in consumer purchasing as a result of the pandemic with uncertainty about
the future

Table 2. Short-term and longer-term strategic research needs to support learning from
COVID-19 impacts and responses.
Immediate research needs:
● To complement price and production data, use survey tools to document and better
understand COVID-19 impacts on people working at all levels in seafood value chains
and seafood consumers in order to direct support to vulnerable actors in the seafood
system.
● Document and share case-experiences of actors in the value chain that have
successfully adapted to shifts in supply and demand of perishable seafood so lessons
from their strategies can be more widely adopted
● Improve open data and data sharing platforms to facilitate the exchange of information
about the societal impacts of COVID-19, to enable more rapid and coordinated
responses to future shocks
Longer-term research needs:
● To design future response strategies in support of the ‘tropical majority’ of small-scale
fish producers and traders, draw on lessons from social safety net programs in other
food sectors, and experience with implementing the Human Right to Food
● Improve information systems to track fish prices and trade volumes typically consumed
by different types of consumers (particularly in LMICs) to reduce wasted fish and
enable value chains to respond to consumers’ nutrition needs and demand preferences.
This may include full traceability of species and stocks based on molecular/DNA
analysis.
● Focus resilience research on those parts of the aquaculture and fisheries system that
supply populations most nutritionally dependent on seafood and those which, through
employment, support food security of low-income value chain actors.
● Develop and apply an evaluation framework and resilience indicators for seafood value
chains, that include social economic and environmental aspects, to identify and learn
from resilience ‘hot-spots’
● Study temporal effects of the shock on employment in the sector, on migration, on
adoption of technologies for production and processing, to better design future crisiscoping strategies and recovery efforts
● Study immediate and longer-term impacts on natural resource systems to identify
means to sustain resources during and after future system shocks

Fig. 2 COVID-19 disruptions and impacts on seafood supply chains. Disruptions to
production, labor, distribution, supply and demand create a range of impacts. The color gradient
indicates the hypothesized relative impacts to different components of- or actors within seafood
supply chains. The ordering of groups is based on multiple data streams collected through May
2020 but is not intended to be a quantitative or absolute ranking. In the center of the figure are
key outcomes we focus on in this paper: human well-being, livelihoods, and food security.
