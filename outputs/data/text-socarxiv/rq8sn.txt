Abstract

4

Cities implemented social distancing measures to cope with COVID-19, which kept people away from

5

nature. A steep drop in the greenspace use was observed in western cities. Surprisingly, news revealed a

6

surging greenspace use in Asian cities. In this study, we used COVID-19 outbreak stages as natural

7

experiments to investigate individual behavioural changes of greenspace use before and during the

8

pandemic. Our case cities are Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and Seoul. We extracted panel data which

9

consisted of longitudinal posts of 100, 232 users, being posted in 1,185 greenspaces in the four Asian cities.

10

Our statistical models found a 5.3% increase in the odds of people using greenspaces for every 100

11

additional weekly new cases. The analyses also revealed people’s preference in larger, nature parks that are

12

close to city centres. Due to the established physical and mental health benefits of greenspaces, people have

13

been escaping to nature to cope with the pandemic in Asian cities.

1. Introduction

24

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency on

25

the 30 January 2020 and a global pandemic on the 11 March 2020. By 29 August 2020, there are 24.5

26

million infected cases and 832.8 thousand deaths, and the numbers keep increasing (WHO, 2020). COVID-

27

19 pandemic impacts our life and society profoundly. Cities worldwide have implemented various social

28

distancing measures which remain the most effective way to reduce the spread of virus (Gu, Jiang, Zhao,

29

& Zheng, 2020; Tian et al., 2020; Wilder-Smith & Freedman, 2020). However, such social distancing

30

measures may keep people away from nature. Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports show that

31

greenspace usage decreased in European and North American cities (Samuelsson, Barthel, Colding,

32

Macassa, & Giusti, 2020). On the contrary, news revealed a surge in greenspace usage in Asia cities such

33

as Hong Kong, Tokyo, Seoul, and Singapore (Fig. 1), where lenient social distancing measures were

34

implemented (Chang, 2020; Jiji, 2020; Sun, Tsang, Wong, & Zhang, 2020). Escaping to nature is a human

35

instinct to avoid harsh environments and infection disasters (Tuan, 1998). During this pandemic, this

36

activity may also become a way for residents to cope with the pandemic in Asian cities.

Kong(Sun et al., 2020), Singapore(Kimberly Lim, 2020), Tokyo(Kirby, 2020) and Seoul(Chang, 2020).

41
42

Modern urban greenspace system could be partially viewed as the planning outcome of how cities

43

responded to previous crises and pandemics in history. Urban planning was shaped by the deteriorated

44

living environment and frequent pandemic outbreaks in European cities in the 19th centuries (Johnson,

45

2006). The 1853 cholera pandemic claimed over 10,000 deaths in London, primarily due to the high density

46

living condition and poor sanitation. London hence created the first public park, Victoria Park, to improve

47

public health after this cholera outbreak (Waller, 2000). The same planning motivation was embedded in

48

Central Park in New York City, Emerald Necklace in Boston, and tree-lined boulevards in Paris (Savitch,

49

2014). These greenspaces have become an integrated component of urban environment.

50
51

Urban greenspaces have well-established physical and mental health benefits (Hartig, Mitchell, de Vries,

52

& Frumkin, 2014; Triguero-Mas et al., 2015; van den Bosch & Ode Sang, 2017). Previous research suggests

53

that exposure to urban greenspaces during the pandemic may have health benefits with the following five

54

pathways (Fig. 2):

55

•

To maintain physical activity. With the widely implemented social distancing measures, many

56

people adopt a sedentary lifestyle which led to a sharp decline in physical activity level (Sallis,

57

Adlakha, Oyeyemi, & Salvo, 2020). Urban greenspaces can provide a suitable setting to for people

58

to maintain their physical activities (Hunter et al., 2015).

59
60

•

To reduce usage of electronic device. With work from home policy, people rely on electronic

61

devices for daily job and communication. Prolonged electronic device usage may increase risk of

62

depression and feeling of loneliness (WHO, 2015). Hence, visiting greenspaces could provide a

63

break from electronic device usage (Jiang, Schmillen, & Sullivan, 2019).

64
65

•

To reduce stress. People feel stressed in the pandemic, especially when they were confined in the

66

indoor environment (Stieger, Lewetz, & Swami, 2020). Biophilia theory, stress reduction theory

67

and attention restoration theory all point out that greenspaces improve restoration from mental

68

fatigue, stress, and negative moods because human beings have an inherent affinity for nature

69

(Kaplan, 1995; Ulrich, 1993; Ulrich et al., 1991; Wilson, 1984). Visiting greenspaces during the

70

pandemic are likely to provide opportunities to contact with nature and reduce stress.

71
72
73

•

To avoid home stressors. Due to prolonged stay at home, people are prone to potentially harmful
interpersonal and environmental stimuli, including domestic violence and abuse, deteriorated

74

family relationship, noise, temperature, air pollution, and crowding (Douglas, Katikireddi, McKee,

75

& McCartney, 2020). Urban greenspace visit can reduce the exposure to such adverse stressors.

76
77

•

To increase social cohesion. It is possible to maintain social contacts in greenspaces and still

78

comply with social distancing measures. For instance, Hong Kong allows for small group

79

gatherings in public places even in the worst stage. When verbal communication with strangers is

80

not feasible, visual contact with others is still beneficial. As found in neuroscience and cognition

81

studies, social gaze is “hard-wired” in the brain, and is a foundational component of communication

82

and social interaction

83

greenspaces may stimulate a sense of social cohesion (Fone et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2020).

(Emery, 2000; Senju & Johnson, 2009). Therefore, seeing others in

84

85
86

Fig. 2: The five pathways on how urban greenspaces contribute to health benefits. During the COVID-19 pandemic, exposure
to urban greenspaces may affect both physical and mental health via these pathways.

87
88

However, empirical findings on how people use greenspaces during the pandemic remain scarce and

89

inconclusive. Based on the Google mobility data in 111 counties in America, a study found that changes of

90

park visit were mainly due to seasonality, not the pandemic (Rice & Pan, 2020). Yet, another study reported

91

that the outdoor recreational activity in greenspaces increased by 291% during the lockdown in Norway

92

based on mobile tracking app data (STRAVA) from runners and cyclists (Rice & Pan, 2020; Venter, Barton,

93

Figari, & Nowell, 2020). The reason for the contrasting results could be attributed to their data aggregation.

94

Both studies were analyzed at the aggregated level, either by counties or by greenspaces, and thus cannot

95

infer individual response to the pandemic.

96
97

Nevertheless, the aforementioned studies have strengths in the usage of big data. This approach could

98

provide vast datasets to assess the relationship between urban greenspace, their usage, and health outcomes

99

during the pandemic due to their high volume, variety and velocity (Ilieva & McPhearson, 2018; Laney,

100

2001). Recent studies assessed eye-level street greenery with large street view imageries and associated it

101

with health outcomes in Hong Kong (Lu, 2019; Wang et al., 2019). A study with 717,527 people whose

102

physical activity were retrieved from smartphones with built-in accelerometry revealed worldwide physical

103

activity inequality (Althoff et al., 2017). In addition, researchers used geotagged social media data,

104

including Twitter, Flickr, and Instagram to understand the pattern of park usage and potential drivers (Chen

105

et al., 2018; Donahue et al., 2018; Hamstead et al., 2018). These studies were made possible by the wide

106

availability of online data.

107
108

In this study, we extracted geotagged social media data from different times to form longitudinal panel

109

datasets. We identified individual greenspace visiting behaviours before and during different stages of the

110

pandemic from 100,232 Instagram users in Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and Seoul. Using the

111

longitudinal panel data of the four Asian cities, we investigated how people shaped their greenspace visiting

112

patterns according to pandemic situation, and how greenspace characteristics influence greenspace usage

113

patterns.

114

Our study contributes to academic and society in three aspects. First, we provided more rigorous result

115

compared to previous cross-sectional studies by forming a longitudinal panel study (Craig, Katikireddi,

116

Leyland, & Popham, 2017; Frees, 2004; Leatherdale, 2018). We use a natural experiment research design,

117

taking the COVID-19 outbreak as an intervention. The individual-level behaviours were collected both

118

before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, we addressed the questions: do people visit urban

119

greenspaces more often during the pandemic than before? And what types of greenspaces have become

120

more popular during the pandemic? Currently, little is known about the relationship between pandemic

121

situation, park characteristics, and park visiting behaviours. Third, we expanded the current understanding

122

of greenspace usage in high-density Asian cities. The greenspace usage pattern during the pandemic in

123

these cities have been largely under-investigated, despite their relatively success in virus control. This

124

research help gain knowledge of greenspace usage in high-density Asian cities.

125
126

2. Methods

127

2.1 Research design

128

We take the COVID-19 outbreak as an intervention, to look at its impact on park visit behaviours in four

129

Asian cities. Hong Kong, Singapore, Seoul and Tokyo are the focuses in our study as they are all densely

130

populated metropolitans with lenient social distancing measures and successfully controlled the pandemic

131

at the time of analysis in March 2020. We formed a longitudinal study with Instagram data to investigate

132

how people change green space visiting behaviours before and during the pandemic.

133
134

The analyses consist of two aspects. Analysis 1 is to study how people use green spaces before and during

135

the pandemic. Analysis 2 is to study what kind of parks received more visits. There did not exist a control

136

group since the outbreak occurred in all the cities.

137

We divided the pandemic situation into three stages following WHO’s announcements regarding COVID-

138

19 development. The analysis was aggregated weekly to balance between computation power and

139

interpretability. The detailed timeline is as shown below:

140

•

141
142

of Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January;
•

143
144

Stage 0 covers seven weeks from 16 December 2019 to 2 February 2020, due to the announcement

Stage 1 covers five weeks from 3 February to 8 March, due to the announcement of a global
pandemic on 11 March;

•

Stage 2 covers the rest three weeks from 9 March to 29 March.

145
146

2.2 Instagram data

147

We collected all the park visit related Instagram posts between 16 December 2019 and 29 March 2020 in

148

the four cities. Also collected were data for weather, new COVID-19 cases, greenspace characteristics and

149

several covariates.

150
151

Instagram data were retrieved with an open-source Instagram API instaloader (Graf & Koch-Kramer,

152

2019). We first collected a list of greenspace names from government websites in each city (Lands

153

Department of Hong Kong, 2014; Tokyo Metropolitan Government Bureau of Construction, 2018; Urban

154

greening Department of Seoul, 2019; Urban Redevelopment Authority, 2017), and then retrieved Instagram

155

location ID for each name with the API. We further extracted all Instagram posts with such location IDs.

156

Each Instagram post includes unique user ID, post time, and location ID. We removed all duplicated

157

Instagram posts, which are multiple posts with the same location ID issued by one person in one day.

158

The weekly Instagram posts were aggregated into two datasets, based on user and greenspace, respectively.

159

The first dataset is for user-based Analysis 1, which consists of 100,232 users’ longitudinal data, who have

160

posted during the study period. With the unique user ID, we can find out one person’s greenspace visiting

161

behaviours during the study period (Fig. 3). Greenspace visit behaviours were converted to a binary

162

outcome because most users have only posted once for the study period. The second dataset is for

163

greenspace-based analysis, which consists of a total of 1,185 greenspaces in four cities (Fig. 4).

167

2.3 Pandemic situation and greenspace characteristics

168

Daily new cases are vital to our study, as COVID-19 acts as a natural intervention to people’s greenspace-

169

visiting behaviours. These records were collected via each city’s government portal (Appendix 1). COVID-

170

19 cases were aggregated to weekly new cases, with a unit of 100 cases. The number of new cases acts as

171

a proxy for the severity of the pandemic.

172

173

Greenspace characteristics include size, distance to city centre, and greenspace type. The sizes were

174

collected from the city’s official websites. Greenspace to city centre distance was calculated using the

175

Euclidean distance. Coordinates of each greenspace were obtained from Instagram posts. City centres are

176

defined as the central business district of each city, and hence their coordinates were extracted from Google

177

Map. Greenspaces were further classified into urban parks and country parks (Appendix 2).

178
179

2.4 Covariates

180

We included three covariates, which may affect greenspace usage. Our four case cities were experiencing

181

different climates, and thus weather data of the study period were collected. The weather records were

182

converted into two covariates: weekly average temperature and the ratio of outdoor-suitable days over a

183

week. The outdoor-suitable day was defined as a day with mild weather, such as sunny, overcast, cloudy,

184

and light rain and with a temperature between 5-35 degree Celsius. In contrast, an unsuitable day is a day

185

with heavy precipitation and below 5 or above 35 degree Celsius. Additionally, as each city has its own

186

holiday schemes, and holidays may be likely to induce greenspace visit. The ratio of holiday and weekends

187

in a week were used as the third covariate.

188
189

2.5 Statistical analysis

190

Corresponding to our two dataset structures (by users and by greenspaces), two panel data analyses were

191

conducted. In Analysis 1, individual participants were the unit of analysis. We explored how the propensity

192

of visiting greenspaces change after entering Stages 1 and 2, as well as the influence of weekly new cases

193

on the greenspace visit behaviours. A mixed effects logistic regression model was used to predict the odds

194

of visiting greenspace during a week for our participants against explanatory variables and covariates

195

(Equation 1). We incorporated a random intercept for each participant. In Analysis 2, greenspaces were the

196

unit of analysis. We explored how greenspace characteristics affect its usage. A mixed effect negative

197

binomial regression model was used to predict total greenspace usage in a week for each greenspace, against

198

explanatory variables and covariates (Equation 2). The random intercept is the parks.

Where i refers to individuals, t refers to the time (week in our study), ε is the random error of the model,

204

(Equation 1)

205
206

We followed a workflow when conducting both analyses. First, we fitted univariable regressions for each

207

variable separately. Second, we fitted a full model with all the variables. Third, we fitted three sensitivity

208

analysis models to test the robustness of the results.

209
210

The first sensitivity analysis used Singapore data, excluding other cities (Analysis 1: n = 329,130; Analysis

211

2: n = 1,085). Singapore has little weather variation and hence is considered to have the least influence from

212

weather changes. The second sensitivity analysis used data from relatively active users and actively used

213

greenspaces in Analysis 1 & 2, respectively. Active users are those who have posted for at least two times

214

over the study period (n = 285,630); actively used greenspaces are those with at least 48 posts over the

215

study period (n = 4,228). These cutoff numbers were determined by the minimum number of posts of the

216

first quantile (top 25%) users or parks, respectively. The third sensitivity analysis used data from stages 1

217

and 2 (Analysis 1: n = 801,856; Analysis 2: n = 4,634). Since the weekly new cases for stage 0 are always

218

zeros, excluding this stage may help see the influence of coronavirus cases more accurately.

219

220

All analyses were conducted using ‘glmmTMB’ package (Brooks et al., 2017) in R (version 4.0.1) (R Core

221

Team, 2014).

222

significance levels were reported for all models. Additionally, the coefficients of each variable against the

223

greenspace usage were plotted to visualize individual effects using ‘effects’ package (Fox & Weisberg,

224

2019). These plots facilitate our understanding of the associations between different variables and the

225

outcomes.

3. Results

228

3.1 Descriptive statistics

229

The number of daily Instagram posts within greenspaces are illustrated in Fig. 5. The spikes indicated

230

weekends and holidays, which experienced higher park visits. Singapore showed a gradual increase in park

231

related posts, especially during Stages 1 and 2. Hong Kong displayed an ‘M’ shape fluctuation with a gentle

232

decrease at the beginning of Stage 1, which recovered during the transition from Stage 1 to 2. Seoul and

233

Tokyo experienced stagnant park visits and a boom entering March.

234

Fig. 5. Daily posts related to parks in four case cities. The spikes in the graph are due to weekend activities.

235
236

As shown in Table 1, Tokyo has the greatest number of users (N=38,138), followed by Singapore

237

(N=21,942), Seoul (N=20,867), and Hong Kong (N=19,285). Singapore and Hong Kong had steady

238

percentage of users visiting greenspaces in three stages (around 9% respectively), whereas Seoul (6%, 7%,

239

13%) and Tokyo (7%, 8%, 16%) experienced a surge of users who visited greenspaces in Stage 3. The

240

percentage of users visiting greenspaces measures the ratio of users who visited greenspaces at least once,

241

divided by total city users in a week.

242
243

In addition, the growth of average weekly new virus cases (’00) is faster in Singapore (Stage 1 = 0.3, Stage

244

2 = 2.3), followed by Hong Kong (Stage 1 = 0.2, Stage 2 = 1.8), Tokyo (Stage 1=0.1, Stage 2=1.2), and

245

Seoul (Stage 1=0.2, Stage 2=1.0). Weekly outdoor-suitable day ratio is defined as the proportion of outdoor-

246

suitable days over a week. Hong Kong had more outdoor-suitable days than other three cities. Weekly

247

temperature refers to the average temperature over a week. Singapore had the highest temperature and the

248

least fluctuation comparing with the other three cities. Weekly holiday ratio measures the ratio of holidays

249

(Saturday, Sunday and public holiday) over a week. The ratio remained around 0.3 across time across the

250

four cities.

3.2 Propensity of visiting greenspaces (Analysis 1)

258

The participants are more likely to visit greenspaces after the COVID-19 outbreak (Table 3 and Fig. 6).

259

The odds of going to greenspaces in Stage 1 increased by 6% (p < 0.001) from Stage 0 in the full model.

260

Similarly, the odds of visiting greenspaces during Stage 2 increased by 26.5% from stage 0 (p < 0.001). As

261

visualised in Fig. 6, the increase from stage 0 to stage 2 is greater. The pattern is consistent in three

262

sensitivity analyses: for users in Singapore only (SA1), for active users who posted for at least two times

263

over the study period (SA2), and for the period of Stage 1 and 2 only (SA3). Effects are more pronounced

264

in sensitivity analyses 1 and 2. Singapore users had an increase of 8.8% from stage 0 to 1 and 31.9% from

265

stage 0 to 2. Active users increased odds by 24.1% and 54.3% for two stages. When considering only stages

266

1 and 2, the odds increased 17.7%, slightly less than the full model.

267
268

Moreover, the propensity of visiting greenspace is positively related to the number of new virus cases in a

269

week. In the full model, the odds of visiting a park increased by 5.3% (p < 0.001) with an increase of 100

270

new cases in a week. As shown in the effects plot (Fig. 6), the weekly new cases are positively associated

271

with greenspace visits. This association remained significant in three sensitivity analyses. Specifically, the

272

odds increased by 8.7% (p < 0.001) when only considering stages 1 and 2, the most out of all models. The

273

odds increased by 2.2% (p < 0.05) for Singapore users and 2.6% (p < 0.01) for active users. People were

274

more likely to visit greenspaces when the pandemic became severe in the four Asian cities.

275
276

All covariates were significant in the full model, and mostly remained significant in the sensitivity analyses.

277

Comparing with those in Singapore, the users in Hong Kong, Seoul, and Tokyo were more likely to go to

278

greenspaces. This trend is reflected in Fig. 6, where Seoul has the highest value and followed by Tokyo,

279

Hong Kong, and Singapore. The increase magnitude was larger in the full model than for the active users

280

but was similar for the stage 1 and 2 model. The weekly temperature and holiday ratio were positively

281

related to the odds of visiting greenspaces. The weekly temperature influenced the most in the full model

282

and less for active users and stages 1 and 2. It was insignificant in the sensitivity analysis with Singapore

283

participants. The holiday ratio’s positive influence was intensified for the Singapore model and the stages

284

1 and 2 model. The effect of weekly outdoor-suitable days was mixed. It was positively related to the park

285

visit in univariate analysis, sensitivity analysis with Singapore, and for active users. Yet, it was negatively

286

related to the outcome in the full model and was insignificant in the sensitivity analysis in stages 1 and 2.

3.3 Greenspace characteristics and usage (Analysis 2)

290

As the full model shows in Table 4, greenspace usage in stages 1 and 2 was higher than in stage 0 for the

291

full model. Stage 1 was 1.095 times (p < 0.001) the expected visits of stage 0, and stage 2 was 1.261 times

292

(p<0.001) of stage 0. This upward trend is reflected in the plot against Stages in Fig. 7. It is consistent with

293

the results from sensitivity analyses for active parks (SA2) and stages 1 and 2 (SA3). Yet, for Singapore

294

parks, the trend was insignificant. Moreover, the weekly new cases were also significantly related to

295

greenspace usage. In the full model, the expected visits increased by 0.063 times (p<0.001) for every 100

296

additional new cases. Sensitivity analyses 2 and 3 are consistent with this trend. Yet for Singapore, the

297

increased number of weekly new cases was insignificant towards park visits.

298
299

Several greenspaces characteristics were significantly correlated with total greenspace usage. Greenspaces

300

closer to city centres were used more often. Distance to city centre was negatively associated with its usage

301

in the full models and in sensitivity analyses 2 and 3. However, it was insignificant in Singapore. Larger

302

greenspaces were used more often. Greenspace area was positively related to its usage in the full models

303

and in all three sensitivity analyses. In terms of park types, nature parks (with predominant nature elements

304

such as country parks or trails) were used more often than urban parks (with large man-made elements such

305

as football fields or community parks), as supported by the full model and sensitivity analyses 1 and 3.

306
307

In terms of covariates, greenspaces in Seoul and Tokyo, but not in Hong Kong, were used more often

308

compared with those in Singapore. Both temperature and holiday ratio are positively related to total

309

greenspace usage. However, the ratio of outdoor-suitable days is insignificant, and it is reflected in the

310

broad confidence interval as shown in the plot against outdoor-suitable days (Fig. 7).

4. Discussion

314

4.1 Principal findings

315

It is unclear how urban residents change their urban greenspace usage in response to the pandemic in Asian

316

cities with lenient social distance measures. In this study, we used longitudinal panel data to explore the

317

individual behavioural change of greenspace usage before and during the pandemic for 100,232 Instagram

318

users from Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and Seoul. We found that the participants are more likely to visit

319

urban greenspaces when there are more new virus cases in a week, after controlling for temperature, weather,

320

and number of holidays. The propensity of visiting greenspaces for our participants increases by 5.3% with

321

100 increase in weekly new cases in a city.

322
323

4.2 Interpretation and implications

324

Our findings provide insights that urban residents in the dense Asian cities may have been using greenspaces

325

as a strategy to cope with the pandemic of COVID-19.

326
327

First, our finding complements that from Norway that greenspace usage increased during pandemic. The

328

Norway study reported an 291% increase in physical activity occurred in greenspaces (Rice & Pan, 2020;

329

Venter et al., 2020). Both our cities and Norway adopted a lenient social distancing measures without total

330

lockdown or stay-at-home order. However, the sampling participants are different in two studies. The

331

participants in the study conducted in Norway is mostly sports enthusiasts using the Strava app, while our

332

participants are the general public. The convergence of the two findings supports the generalizability of the

333

behavioural pattern of urban residents under lenient social distancing measures. However, our result is in

334

contrary to that from US, reporting changes in total greenspace use is largely due to seasonality not the

335

pandemic, based on Google Mobility Report (Rice & Pan, 2020). The difference may be explained by the

336

difference in urban and social context and data resolution. The four Asian cities are more densely populated

337

compared with cities in the US. The residential environment is relatively small and confined in Asian cities.

338

People also cherish more active lifestyles (Bauman et al., 2009). With soft social distancing measures

339

implemented in these cities, people are likely to escape to urban greenspaces when the pandemic become

340

severe. Furthermore, our data were at personal level which could provide refined inquiries, while Google

341

Community Mobility data were aggregated at the city level and were difficult to understand personal

342

behavioural changes based on aggregated data.

343
344

Second, the greenspace use behaviours were associated with weather and holidays. People visit greenspace

345

more often when there is more holiday in a week. People also visit greenspace more often with increased

346

temperature, except in Singapore. The exception is Singapore are not surprising, because the daily average

347

temperature is constant in 12 month the whole year, with highest temperature of 28.3 in May and June and

348

lowest temperature of 26.4 in December (Meteorological Service Singapore, 2020). The results are in line

349

with previous studies (Rice & Pan, 2020; Rice, Park, Pan, & Newman, 2019; Vierikko & Yli-Pelkonen,

350

2019). Human intended to go to nature during good weather. The combat with COVID-19 is still ongoing.

351

In places experiencing severe outbreaks, people should be reminded to take precautions when visiting

352

greenspaces under good weather to prevent from overcrowding.

353
354

Third, greenspace characteristics are related to park usage during the pandemic. Greenspaces which are

355

larger, closer to urban centre, and being nature park (vs. urban park) were used more often. The results are

356

largely in line with previous findings of the association of urban greenspace and number of park users

357

during period without the pandemic (Cohen et al., 2010; Ekkel & de Vries, 2017; Sugiyama, Francis,

358

Middleton, Owen, & Giles-Corti, 2010). Our study added new knowledge to previous studies that nature

359

parks are more popular than urban parks during the pandemic. According to the attention restoration theory,

360

nature parks are often associated with the feeling of “being away” and “fascination”, hence they help urban

361

dwellers reduce stress and recover from mental fatigue (Kaplan, 1995, pp. 174). Nature parks with

362

mountains, forests, lakes are ideal settings for urban residents to escape from the perceived risk and stress

363

related to the pandemic. As supported by psychology studies (Austenfeld & Stanton, 2004; Taylor &

364

Stanton, 2007), short-term escape to nature parks can be an effective emotion-focused coping strategy for

365

urban residents to manage the demands created by the stressful events.

366
367

4.3 Strengths and limitations

368

There are strengths in this study. Methodologically, we designed a natural experiment study with

369

longitudinal panel data of voluntary-submitted social media data. The behavioural change of greenspace

370

usage before and during the pandemic over the same participants were observed. Such panel research design

371

is preferred over cross-sectional design to infer rigorous relationship, because the former is enhanced by

372

temporal ordering and can rule out the effects of unobserved individual differences (Frees, 2004). Our large

373

sample size (N=100,232 persons) in four Asian cities and sensitivity analyses enhance the reliability and

374

robustness of our findings. Theoretically, this study is one of the first to demonstrate that people’s

375

greenspace visit is sensitive to pandemic severity. More specifically, people visit greenspaces more when

376

there are more new virus cases in cities with lenient social distancing measures. In addition, greenspace

377

characteristics are associated with the greenspace popularity during the pandemic. These findings shed new

378

insights into further studies about greenspace management and planning, and health benefits of greenspace

379

during the pandemic.

380
381

This study has some limitations. First, it was difficult to identify a control group because the COVID-19

382

pandemic emerged in almost all global cities. Second, some limitations are inherent in Instagram data. We

383

could not collect individual demographic or socioeconomic factors, such as age, gender, income, vehicle

384

ownership. Though the lack of such information was not crucial to the panel data analysis, we were not able

385

to assess the effects of individual factors on greenspace usage (Frees, 2004). Instagram is one of most used

386

social media apps in these four cities, but they tend to be younger users (NapoleonCat, 2020). Hence, our

387

results may not be applicable to older users, who are more prone to coronavirus infection and adverse

388

symptoms. Last, the motivation, health benefits and potential harms associated with urban greenspace use

389

during the pandemic were not assessed in this study. Though current evidence tentatively suggests infection

390

risk associated with greenspace usage is relatively low. In one recent study investigating the transmission

391

environments of 7,324 infected cases in China, only two cases in one outbreak were linked to outdoor

392

transmission (Qian et al., 2020). Nevertheless, there are still much unknown about such potential health

393

benefits or harms during the unprecedent pandemic. Visiting urban greenspaces may be still associated with

394

higher infection risk when precautions are not taken, e.g. using rails, public toilet and facilities, talking to

395

others with masks. Further studies are needed because understanding such outcomes can inform evidence-

396

based policy making in combating the pandemic.

397
398

5. Conclusion

399

This is the first study demonstrating that people’s greenspace usage during the pandemic is linked to

400

pandemic severity in Asian cities. The propensity of visiting urban greenspaces increased with number of

401

weekly new COVID-19 cases. On a methodological front, using social media big data to analyse

402

behavioural changes at a personal level is a feasible and effective research design, which can control for

403

any unobserved individual factors. We can tentatively draw policy and urban planning implications, if our

404

findings were confirmed in other cities. Given the potential health benefits of urban greenspaces, urban

405

planners and public health officials should create more accessible and large greenspaces, especially nature

406

parks, to increase community resilience in crises and pandemics. At the same time, precautions should be

407

taken to mitigate potential harms, such as keeping social distances, and wearing a mask during social

408

interaction.
