Functional and Dysfunctional Fear of
COVID-19: A Classification Scheme
Abstract
Worry about COVID-19 is a central topic of research into the social and economic consequences
of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we present a new way of measuring worry about
catching COVID-19 that distinguishes between worry as a negative experience that damages
people’s quality of life (dysfunctional) and worry as an adaptive experience that directs people’s
attention to potential problems (functional). Drawing on work into fear of crime, our classification
divides people into three groups: (1) the unworried, (2) the functionally worried (where worry
motivates proactive behaviours that help people to manage their sense of risk) and (3) the
dysfunctionally worried (where quality of life is damaged by worry and/or precautionary
behaviour). Analysing data from two waves of a longitudinal panel study of over 1,000 individuals
living in ten cities in England, Scotland and Wales, we find differing levels of negative anxiety,
anger, loneliness, unhappiness and life satisfaction for each of the three groups, with the
dysfunctionally worried experiencing the most negative outcomes and the functionally worried
experiencing less negative outcomes than unworried. We find no difference between groups in
compliance and willingness to re-engage in social life. Finally, we find a difference between the
dysfunctionally worried compared with functional and unworried groups in perceptions of risk
(differentiating between likelihood, control and consequence). This finding informs what sort of
content-targeted messaging aimed at reducing dysfunctional worry might wish to promote. We
conclude with some thoughts on the applicability of our measurement scheme for future research.

Introduction
The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has affected many aspects of life globally. One
consequence has been the surge of public anxieties and worries in some parts of the world (Lin,
2020), with significant levels of fear of catching COVID-19 being recorded in the UK (Fancourt et
al., 2020), Germany (Gerhold, 2020), Iran (Ahorsu et al., 2020), India (Roy et al., 2020) and China
(Lin, 2020). Worry about catching COVID-19 has been associated with negative outcomes such
as poor mental health (Sloan et al., 2020) and higher levels of prejudice (Lin, 2020; Roy et al.,
2020). It may also be related to reluctance to re-engage with economic and social activities as
lockdown eases (Shaw et al. 2020).

In and of itself, worry (thinking and feeling anxious about actual or potential problems) can
damage people’s mental health and quality of life, but it can also stimulate care and precaution.
The type of worry that helps people to develop coping strategies has been described in the fear
of crime literature as “functional fear”, because it involves people using adaptive emotions and
precautionary activities to help guard themselves against the cause of their worry (Jackson &
Gray, 2010). “Dysfunctional fear”, by contrast, involves people worrying about crime and reporting
that their quality of life is negatively affected by this worry and/or their precautionary behaviour.
In that criminological work, the word “fear” is used as a marker for worry and anxiety about
victimization risk (Farrall et al., 2019).
In this paper we explore whether these groupings exist for worry about COVID-19. Drawing on
self-reports, we classify research participants based on whether they worry, whether that worry
affects their quality of life, whether they take precautions, and whether those precautions make
them feel safer or impact quality of life. We then consider whether membership of these groups
is associated with different outcomes, both negative (e.g. negative affect) and positive (e.g.
compliance and willingness to re-engage with social and economic life). Finally, we consider a
possible intervention to address those experiencing dysfunctional fear, exploring who messaging
should target, but also what content that messaging might consider. To achieve this, we look at
differences in risk perception between the three groups, and speculate on the type of information
that might target people’s perceived likelihood, perceived consequences, and sense of control.
We argue that the dysfunctional group would be best served by targeted messaging and time
and effort from governments and other organisations in order to reduce their worry, or, to shift
them to the “functionally worried” group (Lee et al., 2020).

Worry about COVID-19
COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. To date (28th
October August 2020) there have been 43,540,739 confirmed cases and 1,160,650 confirmed
deaths across 226 countries and territories (World Health Organisation, 2020). Understandably,
such an unprecedented global health crisis has evoked worry and anxiety in large segments of
the population of countries across the world.
Worry about COVID-19 is a topic of interest in research and policy as it is thought to (a) stimulate
adherence with public health measures (good hygiene, social distancing etc), (b) have negative
consequences on mental and physical health, and (c) prevent people from re-engaging with social
and economic life once government restrictions of such activities are eased. This concern has
spurred various initiatives. For example, the World Health Organisation has supported a range of
projects aimed to reduce COVID-19 related stress; for example, a telephone counselling service
in Turkey (World Health Organisation, 2020).
Research into worry about COVID-19 has focused on establishing a way to gauge prevalence of
worry (Ahorsu et al. 2020) and explore some of the possible consequences of worry, e.g. impact
on wellbeing (Fancourt et al., 2020; Sloan et al., 2020), behaviour changes (Gerhold, 2020), and
prejudice against groups perceived as associated with the spread of the virus (Lin, 2020; Roy et
2

al., 2020). It is our contention, however, that the literature would also benefit from engaging with
previous work in victimization worry and risk perception, particularly the understanding that while
worry can be a negative, often debilitating, experience that discourages healthy re-engagement
with the world, it can also be a problem-solving activity, directing people’s attention to problems
and encouraging them to act accordingly.
The distinction between ‘adaptive’ worry and ‘corrosive’ worry is illustrated in a current debate in
the literature on the nature and impact of fear of COVID-19 (Ahorsu et al. 2020; Harper et al.
2020). Ahorsu et al. (2020) assessed the scaling properties of items such as “I cannot sleep
because I am worried about getting coronavirus-19”, “It makes me uncomfortable to think about
coronavirus-19” and “When watching news and stories about coronavirus-19 on social media, I
become nervous or anxious”. Because the resulting scale (with good scaling properties) was
moderately and positively correlated with depression, anxiety, perceived infectability and germ
aversion, what seems to emerge is a continuum that, at one extreme, is something akin to
psychopathology, i.e. something that is part of a spectrum of emotional conditions characterized
by negative affect, including phenomena such as depression, anxiety, and phobias.
Importantly for the current study, however, Harper et al. (2020) fielded the same scale on a new
sample, and found that people who scored higher on the scale were more likely to practice positive
public health behaviours like social distancing. Rather than measuring some kind of pathological
“fear”, they argued, the scale may instead be tapping into adaptive negative emotions that help
guide people to respond to dangerous situations. Psychologists have long recognised the
problem-solving function of worry in the anticipation of future problems and risks (Gladstone &
Parker, 2003). Worry can be a routine and mostly acceptable activity that occurs more or less
daily, about various issues. It transpires mostly in the form of thoughts with a narrative course,
stimulates problem-solving activity, and is an indicator of high levels of responsibility (Tallis et al.,
1994; Berenbaum, 2010).
Such thinking has already been applied to worry about crime (Jackson & Gray, 2010; Gray et al.,
2011). Fear of crime can have adverse emotional effects upon people, inducing a feeling of
isolation and vulnerability and general loss in personal well-being (Hale, 1996), motivating people
to remain indoors more than they would wish or to avoid certain places (Moore & Trojanowicz,
1988); in extreme cases, it can be destructive and paralysing. But people and communities have
the potential to convert worry about crime into constructive action; people who worry in such a
pro-active, non-detrimental manner can be described as experiencing “functional fear” (Lee et al.,
2020).

A typology of worry about COVID-19
Macleod et al. (1991: 478) define worry as a cognitive phenomenon ‘...concerned with future
events where there is uncertainty about the outcome, the future being thought about is a negative
one, and this accompanied by feelings of anxiety.’ Worry can be differentiated into functional and
dysfunctional, based on its nature, effects and how it is managed by people (Tallis et al., 1994,
Gladstone and Parker, 2003). On the one hand, worry can be constructive, helping people to
3

solve potential problems in numerous life domains, e.g. educational performance, finances, and
job prospects. On the other hand, worry can be destructive, with people becoming preoccupied
with negative information and future unpleasant outcomes, hyper-vigilant in scanning for salient
material relating to threat, engaged in the over-estimation of risk, and so forth (Butler & Mathews,
1983, 1987; Tallis & Eysenck, 1994).
Applying this psychological work to criminal victimization risk, but extending the analysis to include
precautionary behaviour, Jackson and Gray (2010) separated people into these groups of
functional and dysfunctional worry about falling victim of crime. The measurement strategy they
used classified people in the ‘functional fear of crime’ group when they said that they were worried
about crime, that they took precautions against crime, that these precautions made them feel
safer, and crucially, that they thought that their quality of life was reduced neither by their worry
nor by their precautions. The implication here is that functional worry motivates a behavioural
response that helps people manage any insecurity in a way that their quality of life is unharmed.
By contrast, ‘dysfunctional fear’ was assumed to be present when people said that their quality of
life was reduced either by worry or precautionary behaviour (or both). Jackson and Gray (2010)
found that victimization experience was associated with dysfunctional worry, but not with
functional worry. In another study, Gray and colleagues found that those experiencing
‘dysfunctional worry’ were at greater risk than those in the other worry categories of experiencing
health problems and seeing their neighbourhood as disorderly and lacking in collective efficacy
(Gray et al., 2011).
Our approach to measurement follows the same template, i.e. we build on psychological work on
worry using a similar empirical approach as Jackson & Gray (2010), which means bringing into
focus people’s precautionary behaviour and sense of impact on their own quality of life. We ask
research participants whether they have or have not worried about catching COVID-19 (we draw
on data from waves 2 and 3 of a panel study, with 64% in wave 2 saying yes), whether they take
precautions against COVID-19 (91% in wave 2 said yes), and whether the precautions they took
made them feel safer (81% in wave 2 said ‘moderately’, ‘quite a bit’ or ‘very much’). Then, based
on whether research participants said that their quality of life was reduced by their worries and/or
precautions, we classify research participants into one of three groups: (a) unworried, (b)
functional worry, and (c) dysfunctional worry.
We then explore whether worry about COVID-19 is associated with experience with COVID-19
like infection or infection of a loved one, and other related issues such as losing a job or
experiencing economic hardship due to government restrictions aimed to curb the spread of
COVID-19. We also assess whether there is a difference in negative emotions between the
different types of worry about COVID-19, and whether worry about COVID-19 is related to
compliance with government restrictions aimed to curb the virus, as well as subsequent reengagement in social and economic activities. Graham et al. (2020) found that personal fear of
COVID-19 significantly predicted compliance with social distancing ordinances. Those who were
more afraid of COVID-19 were more likely to say they would engage in social distancing. They
also found that COVID-related cognitions (perceived risk) and emotions (fear) had different effects
on compliance. However, Wright et al (2020) find evidence that increased confidence in

4

government to tackle the pandemic is longitudinally related to higher compliance, but little
evidence that factors such as mental health and wellbeing, worries about future adversities, and
social isolation and loneliness are related to changes in compliance. In light of this mix of findings,
it is important to further explore this association.

Risk perception and change in worry group
Finally, to help inform effective messaging designed to move people from one group to another
(specifically from the dysfunctional group to the functional group), we consider what sort of
perceptions might mean someone is in one group over the other. Much fear of crime literature
focuses on people’s demographic characteristics (age, gender, race), and this is also the case in
fear of COVID-19 literature. But fear of crime is transitory and situational, meaning that people
move between states of worry. Studies following people over time have found that their worry
levels change as they experience various different situations which might make them worry
(Chataway et al., 2017; Solymosi et al., 2015). It is possible that people also move between
‘functional’, ‘dysfunctional’ worry, and unworried groups over time. Due to the longitudinal survey
design we can examine this for worry about COVID-19, to see how people might shift between
experiencing different types of worry over time.
If people do indeed shift, then that lends support to initiatives aimed to help people out of
dysfunctional states of worry into functional fear. But the question remains what sort of messaging
might be helpful. Fear of crime scholarship has benefited from engagement with research in the
psychology of risk by establishing that perceptions of the likelihood of criminal victimization predict
levels of fear of crime (Jackson, 2009). To establish whether this is also the case for fear of
COVID-19, we apply these measures of risk perception to concerns about contracting the virus:
namely, people’s perceived likelihood of the event happening to them, the perceived control that
they have over the occurrence of the event, and the perceived severity of the consequences of
the event happening. In relation to worry about crime, it seems that the more an individual judges
the likely consequences to be severe, and the less control they feel they have over this risk,, the
higher the expected value of perceived likelihood (Jackson, 2011). If similar risk perceptions are
also associated with worry about COVID-19, it might be an idea to target these perceptions with
information campaigns based on notions of likelihood and/or control and/or consequence, to
reduce dysfunctional worry.

Data and Methods
Sample
We use data collected as part of the ‘Policing the pandemic’ longitudinal study. The surveys were
hosted on Qualtrics and fielded on the online platform Prolific Academic. Prolific is similar to other
crowdsourcing platforms such as Mechanical Turk but has a larger, more diverse pool of UK
participants. In line with Prolific recruitment protocols, participants received compensation for their
5

time. We use data from the second and third waves collected between 11-14 May (wave 2) and
1 - 5 June (wave 3) 2020 (The first wave did not ask questions about worry). The second wave
was fielded the day after UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s address to the nation that announced
an easing of the initial lockdown restrictions. These changes involved revised messaging from
‘stay at home’ to ‘stay alert’ as well as some rule changes (e.g. allowing more outdoor activities
within and contact between households), and came into force on 13 May. The data collection of
the third wave took place ten days after the nation learnt about the lockdown breach by Dominic
Cummings, the prime minister’s chief advisor, which was followed by a national outcry. The data
collection for wave 3 also coincided with further easing of the restrictions, including permitting up
to six people to meet outside, the reopening of some childcare facilities, and so on. According to
the data by the Office of National Statistics, on the week of survey wave 2, 3,810 people died with
COVID in the UK; this dropped to 1,588 COVID deaths by the week of wave 3. A total of 1,100
people participated in wave 2 of the study, and 1,019 in wave 3. Respondents lived in ten
metropolitan areas across the UK (Birmingham, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool,
Manchester, Newcastle, Sheffield, and London). Quota weights were calculated1 for gender and
age. Although quota sampling is not probabilistic in nature, the stratification involved with the
sampling strategy meant that after the data collection quota weights could adjust the results
making them largely representative of the ten cities in our sample.

Variables
This section details how we operationalise the key concepts discussed above. The specific
questionnaire items are in Appendix 1.

Worry and precautionary activity
In order to classify worry about COVID-19, we use answers to questions adapted from fear of
crime questions (e.g. see Jackson et al., 2009), asking people whether they had felt worried about
getting COVID-19 in the past 3 weeks, and to what extent their quality of life was reduced by this
worry. We note that we use the phrases “functional fear” and “dysfunctional fear” because they
are good phrases, but we do not claim to be measuring fear -- we ask research participants about
their “worry”, leaving them to interpret what “worry” means. By explicitly stating ‘worry’ and
‘worried’ in the question wording, we make sure to measure worry as both a cognitive and
emotional phenomenon.
To measure whether people take precautions and how these affect them, we asked questions
based on precautions people take against crime victimisation (eg see Newton et al., 2020), asking
whether they take precautions, and to what extent these affect their quality of life and make them
feel safer. Regarding the definition of ‘quality of life’ we left it up to participants to define what this
means to them, as the question asked directly to what extent either worry or precautions ‘reduce
your quality of life’.

1

This was calculated by re-balancing the data where the tabulation of results becomes more than a
simple counting process

6

Previous experience
To match ‘previous victimisation’ in fear of crime studies, we asked about previous experience
with COVID-19. This included whether participants had had COVID-19 themselves or whether
they had been affected by any of the following: themselves or a member of their household losing
their job or being unable to work, being unable to pay bills, access sufficient food or required
medication, having been evicted or lost accommodation otherwise, and having someone they are
close to go in hospital or die as a result of COVID-19. Based on these measures, a summative
score of how much the person had been affected by COVID-19 was calculated, where higher
scores indicate they were more severely affected. This is not a construct as such, rather a sum
of negative life experiences (possibly unrelated to one another) caused by COVID-19.

Emotions
To assess the extent to which mental and emotional wellbeing is associated with worry we asked
people about how strongly they had felt anxiety, anger, loneliness, and happiness in the previous
day. We also asked people overall how satisfied they are with their life and to what extent they
feel that the things they do in life are worthwhile. Those who answered they felt
anxiety/anger/loneliness "Not at all" were coded as “No”, everyone else as “Yes” to experiencing
these outcomes. For happiness, those who answered "Not at all" were coded as "Yes" to never
having felt happy, and for Worthwhile and Satisfied we coded "Not at all..." feeling that the things
they do in their lives were worthwhile or "Not at all..." satisfied with their lives as "Yes" to feeling
not satisfied and not worthwhile. As a result, a positive (“Yes”) outcome for each respective
emotions indicator represents a bad emotional experience. We also created a summative
emotion score, where answers were re-coded to run from 1 to 5, with higher scores representing
a worse emotional outcome. A Cronbach’s alpha of 0.88 indicates good internal consistency
among these indicators.

Compliance and reengagement
We also asked people the extent to which they engaged in the following behaviours: socialised in
person with friends or relatives they do not live with; went for a walk or run or cycle and spent
time sitting somewhere to relax; and travelled for leisure. In wave 2 these behaviours were in
breach of the lockdown restrictions put in place by government, so participating in these events
reflected a lack of compliance. However, in wave 3, these behaviours were once again allowed.
As a result, people in the UK were being encouraged to re-engage in some semblance of normal
life--they were allowed to stop and rest during or after walking, running and cycling, they were
allowed to travel for leisure, and they were allowed to socialise in groups of 6 in England or 8 in
Scotland. Thus, changes in self-reported behaviour betweens waves 2 and 3 represented the
extent to which research participants were re-engaging with the social world. We calculated a reengagement score by taking the score for the compliance item in wave 2 and subtracting it from
the sum of the compliance items in wave 3. This means higher scores indicate more reengagement: A score of 0 represents no change in engagement, a negative score represents
more engagement in wave 2 than wave 3 (less engagement after easing of lockdown), and a
positive score signals more participation in the activity in wave 3 than wave 2 (re-engagement).

7

Similar to impact of COVID-19 score, this is not a construct as such, rather a mock-count using a
formative approach to measurement adding up people’s answers to create an index.

Control variables
Of course, other factors besides worry might affect compliance and reengagement, so we
included measures of the following in our modelling: knowledge of the virus (self-rated knowledge
level of the virus), their perceived risk of sanctions for breaching lockdown restrictions (how likely
they think it is to be caught and sanctioned for each activity), expressive function of the law
(whether they think it was right or wrong to make social distancing a legal requirement, and
whether doing so clarifies the restrictions and sends the message of its importance in fighting the
pandemic), social norms (whether people think it is important to follow social distancing guidelines
and if they perceive their community to also think this is important), feelings of duty to obey the
police and follow the law, and their normative alignment with the police and the law.
We also asked for demographics, such as age, gender, ethnicity, and whether they held
employment that considered them to be ‘key workers’.

Risk perception
Finally, to measure perception of risk, we used three risk related questionnaire items adapted
from perceived victimization risk questions (Jackson, 2009) to measure perceived likelihood (how
likely they think it is to catch COVID-19 in next 3 weeks), perceived severity of consequences
(how severe they expect the consequences to their health to be), and perceived control (to what
extent they believe they can control whether or not they catch COVID-19 in the next 3 weeks).

Results
Defining and measuring worry about COVID-19
In wave 2 just over one-third (34%) of people said that “No”, they had not worried about getting
COVID-19 in the past 3 weeks. From those who said “Yes”, there was variation in self-reported
frequency and intensity of worry. 35% of people who were worried experienced this “Once or
twice” in the last 3 weeks, while 21% worried more than 10 times in this timeframe. On the last
occasion, 58% said they “felt fairly worried” or “very worried”.
First, individuals were classified as unworried if they reported being unworried about catching
COVID-19: it did not matter if they took precautions that made them feel safer, or if their quality
of life was reduced by their precautions; if they reported being unworried they were simply
classified as unworried.
To be classified in the functional worry group, respondents must have met three conditions: (a)
they must have reported being worried about catching COVID-19; (b) they must have taken

8

precautions that made them feel safer; and (c) they must have judged their quality of life to be
unaffected by either their worries or their precautions. Importantly, we assume that the worry
process partly motivates these beneficial precautions; as Tallis & Eysenck (1994) argue, worry
can play a problem-solving role in people’s lives by stimulating action and helping them deal with
uncertain future events. Finally, to be classified in the dysfunctional worry group, respondents
must have reported being worried about COVID-19 but also that their quality of life was reduced
by either their worries or their precautions (or both), or their precautions to not have made them
feel safer.
To generate the three groups, Tables 1 and 2 break down the sample. Overall 35% (n = 401,
weighted n = 312) of respondents were unworried. The other two categories – functional worry
and dysfunctional worry – are subsets of the remaining 65% of respondents (n = 690, weighted n
= 581). Of these, 4% (n = 34, weighted n = 25) took no precautions, 93% (n = 641, weighted n =
541) took precautions and felt safer as a result, and 1% (n = 5, weighted n = 6) took precautions
but did not feel safer as a result (Table 1). We make this distinction because of the central role
that beneficial precautionary activity plays in the functional/dysfunctional distinction.

Table 2 takes the categorisation process one step further by also considering whether the worry
or the precautions had an effect on people’s quality of life. Overall 37% (n = 206, weighted n =
203) said their quality of life was not affected by either precautions or worry, 33% (n = 236,
weighted n = 181) said they were affected by both, 12% (n = 82, weighted n = 64) said their quality
of life was reduced by their worry but not the precautions, and 18% (n = 122, weighted n = 99)
said this was the other way around (precautions but not the worry).
By cross-tabulating precautionary activity with levels of impact on quality of life, we can identify
the functionally worried and the dysfunctionally worried. The cell to highlight is top-left (Table 2).
This represents the functionally worried – the subset of the sample who were worried about
COVID-19, who took precautions that made them feel safer, and whose quality of life was not
reduced by either worry or precaution. The other three cells comprise the dysfunctionally worried
group.

Bringing this classification process to a close, we found that just over one-third (35% (n = 401,

Previous experience
We consider whether the person had COVID-19 themselves or not and draw on our measure of
how much COVID-19 had affected their lives by tallying the many negative outcomes we asked
about. In total, 14% (183) had themselves lost their job or were unable to work, 10% (118) had a
member of their household lose their job or be unable to work, 6% (67) reported being unable to
pay bills, 0.4% (5) couldn’t access sufficient food, 5% (59) couldn’t access required medication,
2% (28) had been evicted or otherise lost their accommodation, 3% (36) saw someone they are
close to go in hospital and 3% (35) saw someone close die as a result of COVID-19. Some 171
people reported suspecting themselves having COVID-192.
We see that those who have had (or thought themselves to have had) contracted COVID-19
already are more likely to be in the functionally worried group (vs unworried). On the other hand,
those scoring higher in the COVID-19 effect measures are those in the ‘dysfunctional worry’ group
(Table 4).

Negative outcomes on emotional well being
We find that separating out the types of worry, and comparing to the unworried, shows that for
all our measures of emotional wellbeing those in the ‘dysfunctionally worried’ group report more
negative emotions than those who are not worried, while those in the ‘functional’ worry group do
not. In fact, on all outcomes, those in the functionally worried group report fewer negative
emotional outcomes than the unworried, while dysfunctional worry group report more (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Emotional wellbeing outcomes by worry group

Separating out the functional and dysfunctional worry here highlights that it is those who are
experiencing ‘dysfunctional worry’ that are more affected by these negative outcomes, and not
the ‘functional worry’ group.
Modelling the outcome variable to the summative score on negative emotional outcomes shows
that those in the functional worry group score lower on this negative emotion score than unworried
people, while those in the dysfunctional group score higher, i.e. have worse wellbeing outcomes
(Table 5).

Lockdown compliance/ re-engaging with social and economic
activities
We next consider whether worry is a factor in shaping people’s compliance with lockdown
regulations, and whether worry discourages people from re-engaging with social and economic
activities once these restrictions are eased. We asked people a series of questions related to
compliance as well as questions about other factors which may influence such behaviours (see
‘Variables’ section in ‘Data and Methods’). When we consider the effect of being in either the
functionally or dysfunctionally worried group, while controlling for these other possible predictors
of compliance with social distancing (Table 6) and re-engagement with the social world (Table 7),
we find that functional worry does play a role in social distancing: people who are functionally
worried are more likely to report frequent compliance with social distancing than people who are
unworried or dysfunctionally worried. Neither type of worry seems to play a significant role in
overall compliance.

Risk perception
We now turn to whether it is possible for people to move between worry groups, and what might
motivate them to do so. Previously we found that some factors such as previous experience with
COVID-19 and the extent to which it has negatively affected people’s lives are related to which
group they belong to (see ‘Previous experience’ section). Yet, this is not something that lends
itself readily to practical interventions aimed to nudge people from one group to the other.
Instead, here we explore how perceived risk might differ between the worry groups as this might
be something that targeted messaging might better be able to influence. First, we need to see
whether people move between worry groups, or whether this is a static attribute. The longitudinal
nature of this survey allows us to assess this. While most people stayed in the same group
between the two waves (71%), almost a third (29%) moved between categories (Figure 2).

19

Figure 2: Movement between Functional, Dysfunctional, and Unworried worry groups
between waves 2 and 3 of the panel survey

Clearly it is possible for people to move out of this dysfunctional worry category, so messaging
targeted at this group to encourage this shift might be a helpful policy intervention to explore. But
what sort of content might be useful? Would they be messages based on control: what people
can do to manage their risk? Would they be messages based on consequence: would they stress
the low relative risk of serious health outcomes among, say, younger people?
As mentioned earlier, in relation to fear of crime, risk perception in terms of the perceived
likelihood of victimization, control over this likelihood, and the perceived severity of the
consequences all play a role in people’s worry (Jackson, 2011). It is possible that these also affect
belonging to worry about COVID-19 groups.
Indeed, we find the unworried group have lower perceived likelihood and severity of
consequences and higher perceived control, the functionally worried group are in the middle, and
those in the dysfunctional worry group have the highest perceived likelihood and perceive the
most severe consequences (Figure 3).

20

Figure 3: Perceived likelihood, control, and consequences between worry groups

To quantify, we set ‘dysfunctional worry’ as the reference category to see how these elements of
risk perception are associated with membership of either functional or unworried groups in
comparison (Table 8).

Dysfunctionally worried group members perceive higher likelihood and more severe
consequences of catching COVID-19 than both unworried and functionally worried group
members, while also perceiving lower control over whether or not they will get exposed to the
virus. Since these are perceptions, one approach that an intervention could take would be to
consider messaging aimed at addressing these, maybe considering ways in which people might
gain greater control over their risk of infection.

Discussion
Our paper has approached worry about COVID-19 as something that can have both negative
outcomes in terms of
people’s mental health and emotional wellbeing, and positive
consequences in terms of the likelihood of taking precautions and helping people protect
themselves from the consequences of the virus. Analysing data from a panel study of attitudes
and experiences with COVID-19 across ten UK cities, we classified people into groups of
functional, dysfunctional, and no worry, based on previous development of such typologies in fear
of crime literature. Using this method we found that dysfunctional worry (i.e. worry which affects
quality of life, or leads to taking precautions which are either worthless (do not make the person
feel safer) or result in reduced quality of life) was associated with negative emotional outcomes
which may affect people’s mental health. On the other hand, people who experienced functional
worry, which is worry that encourages them to take precautions, did not have the same
association with these negative outcomes. This suggests that, for some people, some worry is

23

beneficial, and does not damage wellbeing. Similar to the relationship between previous
victimisation and fear of crime, we found that having previous negative experiences as a result of
COVID-19 such as loss of income or housing was associated with dysfunctional worry, but unlike
crime victimisation, having had COVID-19 was associated with functional worry instead.
We also found, however, that none of the groups of worry were associated with either levels of
compliance with lockdown measures, nor with subsequent re-engagement in these activities once
the restrictions are lifted. It is instead likely that other factors are at play, such as the sense of a
common fate, a shared identity, or acting for the common or the social good, centred around
national sentiment towards the NHS for example.
Finally, one key difference between the worry groups was perceived risk, made up of the
perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19, perceived severity of the consequences, and their
perceived control over it. We suggest that future work could explore any causal relationship in
order to inform targeted interventions that may help move people out of the dysfunctional worry
group into the functional one and thus, it might be hoped, improving their quality of life and other
outcomes. Interventions aimed at reducing worry should target those experiencing dysfunctional
worry, possibly by exploring the effect that targeted messaging/ communications campaigns might
have on reducing perceived likelihood and severity of consequences, or increasing people’s
perceived ability to control whether or not they contract the virus.
Of course, such targeted messaging should take into account all possible consequences, and
specifically that the aim is to move people from dysfunctional to functional worry. We would want
to eliminate the negative outcomes on wellbeing, but maintain the prosocial precautionary
behaviour of functionally worried folk. For example, it might be an intervention to trial whether
identifying and messaging dysfunctionally worried people about ways in which they can gain some
control over their risk of catching COVID-19, for example by talking about wearing masks
(something they can control) in places where they do not perceive other people to be following
social distancing guidelines (something they cannot control) to increase perceived control. A
follow-up evaluation of such messaging might measure to what extent such messaging influences
perceived control, and whether if it increases people’s sense of control this is associated with
moving out of dysfunctional and into functional worry. We note that risk perception has to be
understood in a systems context, as people belonging in one worry group or the other is likely
influenced by a myriad of complex reasons (e.g. past experiences, existing circumstances,
policies) and so on, but targeted (e.g. warning) messages can influence these perceptions within
said contexts (Laughery and Wogalter, 1997).
In light of the above findings, we suggest that future studies exploring worry about COVID-19 take
into account this difference between functional and dysfunctional worry. Of course, we realise that
asking many follow-up questions is not always possible due to resource and other constraints, so
asking about worry and precautions might not always be feasible. In our data, we also explored
a simplified classification, in which we do not take into account precautions, but instead divide
people into functional or dysfunctional worry based on whether their worry reduces their quality
of life or not. Using this simpler classification, we find the same relationships between

24

dysfunctional worry and worse negative emotional outcomes, and the same differences in risk
perception, alongside there still being no relationship between worry and compliance or reengagement (see Appendix 2). While such a simplified definition loses some of the nuance of
considering the effect of precautions (whether these made people feel safer and/or reduced their
quality of life), in situations of constrained resources they should identify similar patterns to the
more complete definition. Further work might pursue a more nuanced definition which considers
the intensity and frequency of precautionary behaviours in the classification of dysfunctional and
functional fear, distinguishing between active or passive behaviours in response to perceived
threats that are proximal or distal within an individual's environment, and whether a shift from
active precautions to more passive precautions account for functional worry.

Appendix 1
Worry and precautionary activity
●
●
●
●
●

In the past 3 weeks, have you ever felt worried about getting COVID-19? (Yes/No)
To what extent was your quality of life reduced by your worry about COVID-19? (Not at all
– very much)
Do you take any precautions against getting COVID-19? (Yes/No)
To what extent do these precautions reduce your quality of life? (Not at all – very much)
To what extent do these precautions make you feel safer? (Not at all – very much)

Catching COVID-19
Research participants were asked whether they had had COVID-19 themselves or not, counting
both confirmed and suspected cases as “Yes” they had had COVID-19.

Impact of COVID-19 on people’s lives
We asked a series of questions designed to tap into how each person had been personally
affected by COVID-19. These are:
●
●
●
●
●
●
●
●

Lost your job/been unable to do paid work
Other member of your household lost their job or was unable to do paid work
Unable to pay bills
Evicted/lost accommodation
Unable to access sufficient food
Unable to access required medication
Somebody close to you is in hospital with Covid-19
You lost somebody close to you to Covid-19

Here we simply sum all the cases where the person answered that ‘yes’ this had happened to
them to attain a score of how much the person had been affected by COVID-19, where higher
score means more severely affected.

Emotions
To measure people’s emotions, we asked the following questions:
●

28

Thinking about how you felt yesterday, overall, how strongly did you feel the following
emotions? (Not at all - Very Strongly)
○ Anxiety
○ Anger

●
●

○ Loneliness
○ Happiness
Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays? (Not at all satisfied - Completely
satisfied)
Overall, to what extent do you feel that the things you do in your life are worthwhile? (Not
at all worthwhile - Completely worthwhile)

Compliance and reengagement
In waves 1, 2 and 3 we measured what in the first two waves represented compliance with
lockdown. We asked how often in the past three weeks research participants had:
•
•
•

Socialised in person with friends or relatives whom you don’t live with
Went out for a walk, run, or cycle and spent more than a few minutes sitting somewhere to
relax
Travelled for leisure (e.g. driven somewhere to go for a walk)

By the time of wave 3, these behaviours no longer broke lockdown because of its gradual ease.
People in the UK were being encouraged to re-engage in some semblance of normal life--they
were allowed to stop and rest during or after walking, running and cycling, they were allowed to
travel for leisure, and they were allowed to socialise in groups of 6 (8 in Scotland). Thus, changes
in self-reported behaviour between waves 2 and 3 represented the extent to which research
participants were re-engaging. We calculated a re-engagement score by taking the score for the
compliance item in wave 2 and subtracting it from the sum of the compliance items in wave 3.
This means higher scores means more re-engagement: 0 is same engagement, negative is more
engagement in wave 2 than wave 3 and positive is more participation in the activity in wave 3
than wave 2.

each of the following statements? [1-5: strongly disagree, disagree, neither disagree nor agree,
agree, or strongly agree]
1. People should do what the law says
2. A person who disobeys laws is a danger to others in the community
3. Obeying the law ultimately benefits everyone in the community

Normative alignment with the law
And thinking about the law in the United Kingdom, to what extent do you agree or disagree with
each of the following statements? [1-5: strongly disagree, disagree, neither disagree nor agree,
agree, or strongly agree]
1. My own feelings about what is right and wrong usually agree with the laws that are
enforced by the police and the courts
2. The laws in my community are consistent with your own intuitions about what is right and
just
3. The laws of our criminal justice system are generally consistent with the views of the
people in our community about what is right and wrong

Risk perception
To explore this, we consider people’s reply to three risk related questionnaire items adapted
from fear of crime perceived likelihood questions (Jackson, 2009):
•
Perceived Likelihood: “How likely do you think it is that, in the next 3 weeks, you will catch
COVID-19?”

31

•
•

32

Perceived Severity of Consequences: “If you contracted COVID-19, how severe do you
expect its consequences to be on your health?”
Perceived Control: “To what extent do you feel able to control whether or not, in the next 3
weeks, you will catch COVID-19?”

Appendix 2: Results with simplified classification
In this appendix we present the results above using the simpler classification scheme.

Defining and measuring fear of COVID-19
In wave 2 just over one-third (34%) of people said that “No”, they had not worried about getting
COVID-19 in the past 3 weeks. From those who said “Yes”, there was variation in self-reported
frequency and intensity of worry. 35% of people who were worried experienced this “Once or
twice” in the last 3 weeks, while 21% worried more than 10 times in this timeframe. On the last
occasion, 58% said they “felt fairly worried” or “very worried”.
First, individuals were classified as unworried if they reported being unworried about catching
COVID-19: it did not matter if they took precautions that made them feel safer, or if their quality
of life was reduced by their precautions; if they reported being unworried they were simply
classified as unworried.
To be classified in the functional worry group, respondents must have met three conditions: (a)
they must have reported being worried about crime; (b) they must have taken precautions that
made them feel safer; and (c) they must have judged their quality of life unaffected by either their
worries or their precautions. Importantly, we assume that the worry process partly motivates these
beneficial precautions; as Tallis & Eysenck (1994) argue, worry can play a problem-solving role
in people’s lives by stimulating action and helping them deal with uncertain future events. Finally,
to be classified in the dysfunctional worry group, respondents must have reported being worried
about COVID-19 but also that their quality of life was reduced by either their worries or their
precautions (or both).
To generate the three groups, Tables 1 and 2 break down the sample. Overall 34 % (n = 401,
weighted n = 312) of respondents were unworried. The other two categories – functional worry
and dysfunctional worry – are subsets of the remaining 65% (n = 699, weighted n = 596).
Of these 65%, 4% (n = 34, weighted n = 25) took no precautions, 91% (n = 641, weighted n =
541) took precautions and felt safer as a result, and 1% (n = 5, weighted n = 6) took precautions
but did not feel safer as a result (Table 1). We make this distinction because of the central role
that beneficial precautionary activity plays in the functional/dysfunctional distinction.
Table 1 here

Table 2 takes the categorisation process one step further by considering also whether the worry
or the precautions had an effect on people’s quality of life. Overall 37% (n = 206, weighted n =
203) said their quality of life was not affected by either precautions or worry, 33% (n = 236,
weighted n = 181) said they were affected by both, 12% (n = 82, weighted n = 64) said their quality
of life was reduced by their worry but not the precautions, and 18% (n = 122, weighted n = 99)
said this was the other way around (precautions but not the worry).

33

By cross-tabulating precautionary activity with levels of impact on quality of life, we can identify
the functionally worried and the dysfunctionally worried. The cell to highlight is top-left (Table 2).
This represents the functionally worried – the subset of the sample who were worried about
COVID-19, who took precautions that made them feel safer, and whose quality of life was not
reduced by either worry or precaution. The other three cells comprise the dysfunctional worry
group.
Bringing this classification process to a close, we found that just over one-third (34% (n = 401,
weighted n = 312)) of the sample were unworried, about one-in-five (36% (n = 355, weighted n =
331)) were functionally worried, and just less than a half (29% (n = 344, weighted n = 265)) were
dysfunctionally worried (Table 3).

Movement between groups
While most people have stayed in the same group between the two waves (68%), almost a third
(32%) moved between categories (Figure 2).
Unworried group have lower perceived likelihood and severity of consequences and higher
perceived control, the Coping group are in the middle, and the Struggling group have the highest
perceived likelihood and perceive most severe consequences.
