Abstract
Does schooling affect social inequality in educational achievement? Earlier studies based on
seasonal comparisons suggested schooling to equalize social gaps in achievement, but recent
replication studies gave rise to skepticism about the validity of older findings. We propose an
alternative causal design that identifies schooling exposure effects by exploiting (conditionally)
random variation in test dates and birth dates for children participating in assessment studies.
We test effects of school exposure in first grade for a series of learning domains (vocabulary,
grammar, math, and science) by drawing on recent data from the German National Educational
Panel Study (NEPS). Findings clearly indicate that schooling increases learning in all domains
and particularly in math and science. However, we did not find any evidence that schooling
effects differed by children’s socio-economic background. We conclude that, while all children
benefitted by first-grade exposure, first-grade schooling had no consequences for social
inequality in learning. We discuss the relevance of our approach and results in the context of
the massive school lockdowns due to the COVID-19 crisis and to further knowledge on the role
of schooling in the process of social stratification.

INTRODUCTION
What is the role of schooling for social inequality in learning? A well rooted tradition of
research stresses the role of non-school factors in creating unequal learning outcomes and
suggests that schooling, if anything, tends to equalize social inequality in achievement.
Proponents of this ‘compensatory’ view argue that equalization happens because schooling
exposes children to more similar environments than the ones they would experience in the outof-school counterfactual, that is the home environments (Downey, von Hippel, & Broh, 2004;
Raudenbush & Eschmann, 2015). This exact view has fed fears of amplifying social disparities
in learning and educational opportunities as a result of worldwide school lockdowns in the wake
of the COVID-19 crisis. If the school system reduces inequality, then the absence of schoolbased teaching may foster such disparities in children’s learning.
The idea of schooling as equalizer was tested for the first time half a century ago by
comparing learning rates across seasons (Heyns, 1978). If test score inequality increases faster
over the summer than the school year, then school-factors contribute to the reduction of social
inequality in learning. Studies employing the seasonal comparison design (hereafter: SCD)
have dominated sociological research on schooling effects for the last 40 years (Alexander,
Entwisle, & Olson, 2007; Downey et al., 2004; Entwisle & Alexander, 1992; Hayes & Grether,
1983). Only recently, proponents of the SCD themselves have criticized it for being prone to
various statistical artifacts – such as scaling of tests and comparability of test forms – that might
have led to an overestimation of schooling’s equalizing role (von Hippel & Hamrock, 2019a;
von Hippel, Workman, & Downey, 2018).
Besides artifacts that may occur as a by-product of repeated testing, the causal validity
of the SCD approach hinges on one particularly crucial assumption: the summer is an
appropriate counterfactual for the absence of schooling. However, many things may occur
during the summer that might be related to differential learning but unrelated to school absence.
SCD studies, thus, tend to conflate ‘summer’ specific factors with more regular out-of-school
factors in estimating schooling effects. Furthermore, SCD studies impose high requirements on
data such as repeated test score measurements within and across school grades. Outside US,
those requirements are rarely met by international or national assessment studies (for some
exceptions, see Holtmann, 2017; Verachtert, Van Damme, Onghena, & Ghesquière, 2009).

3

We propose a more parsimonious design for estimating the effect of schooling that is
less prone to confounding issues and maybe applicable to a wider set of national assessment
data. The proposed design, inspired by previously applied in psychological research on
cognitive development (Carlsson, Dahl, Öckert, & Rooth, 2015; Cliffordson & Gustafsson,
2008), requires only one assessment per child over the school year and rest on the fact that, in
many practical instances, children are not tested at the same time but at different and random
time points of the academic year. Exploiting random variation in test dates and the month of
birth across children entering school life on the same calendar day, the design identifies the
effect that the exposure to the school system has on the achievement of students having the
same age at the test day and the social gaps therein.
We apply our design to the case of Germany and focus on the effects of exposure to
first-grade schooling. Germany is a country in which early social inequality in achievement
matters in particular because Germany’s stratified education system tracks students based on
their achievement as early as at the age of 10. Previous studies on Germany reported large social
gaps in cognitive achievement even before children enter school or right at the school start
(Linberg, Schneider, Waldfogel, & Wang, 2019; Skopek & Passaretta, 2020). Moreover, such
early gaps seem to explain the majority of social gaps in achievement found at the age of
transition to secondary schooling (Passaretta et al., 2020). Therefore, studying the contribution
of the schooling to the formation of social gaps around first grade is of critical concern in the
tracked educational system of Germany. Moreover, Germany provides a theoretically
interesting contrast to the case of US predominantly researched previously. Our study employs
recent and representative data the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS). NEPS
implemented a comprehensive test program that allowed us to study school exposure effects on
various intellectual domains including math, science, grammar, and vocabulary.
Our results show that increased exposure to first-grade schooling improves student
learning with respect to all inspected outcomes. However, there is no evidence for those schoolexposure effects to differ by children’s socio-economic background. We conclude that firstgrade schooling had no consequences for social inequality in learning.
The paper proceeds as follows. First, we discuss the recent state of schooling research
based on the SCD design. Second, we introduce our alternative approach to identify school
exposure effects and its potential contribution. Third, we describe data, sampling, variables and
the statistical models estimated. Fourth, we present findings and discuss robustness checks.

4

Finally, we embed our findings to the state of research and discuss the relevance of our results
and approach for the recent challenges posited by the COVID-19 crises and to further
knowledge on the role of schooling for social stratification.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON THE ROLE OF SCHOOLING FOR ACHIEVEMENT GAPS
Studying the effect of schooling on social gaps in learning involves comparing outcomes in two
states: school versus out-of-school. Since nearly all children in Western societies attend school,
in practice, constructing a valid out-of-school counterfactual represents an empirical challenge.
The SCD establishes such counterfactual comparison by comparing social gradients in learning
rates during the school year – when school is on – versus the summer holiday season – when
school is off. The design requires measuring achievement on the same cognitive domain at the
beginning and the end of two consecutive school years in order to estimate three seasonal
learning rates and the related social gradients (see Figure 1). A central assumption is that while
both school and non-school factors shape learning during the school year, non-school factors
only influence learning during the summer. This way one can assess the contribution of
schooling to learning and to social inequality in learning.

[FIGURE 1]

Earlier SCD research in the US quite consistently found SES inequality in learning to
increase faster in the summer period than the school year (e.g., Entwisle & Alexander, 1992;
Hayes & Grether, 1983; Heyns, 1978, 1987; Murnane, 1975; Reardon, 2003). Early studies, by
now older than 40 years, already suggested that “when it comes to inequality by socioeconomic
status, schools are more part of the solution than the problem” (Downey and colleagues 2004,
p.616). In the 2000s, a second wave of studies refined the SCD in an attempt to minimize bias
arising from non-perfect overlap of test dates with the first and last days of the school years
(Burkam, Ready, Lee, & LoGerfo, 2004; Downey et al., 2004). Notwithstanding, results
supported the earlier studies’ general conclusion of schooling effectively equalizing social gaps
in learning.
The seemingly consistent evidence from SCD research has been contested by a couple
of critical replication studies only recently. As von Hippel and Hamrock (2019) uncovered in
their study, findings of previous studies were driven by statistical artifacts related to seasonal

5

change in the test-forms and non-comparable scaling of test-score data at various measurement
occasions. Not all results and conclusions fell, however. When replicating one of the most
influential works published by Downey and colleagues (2004) using newer data and properly
scaled measures, von Hippel et al. (2018) found that while equalization effects of schooling
were generally weak, schools did act as equalizing institutions in the early years of life. The
conclusion that schooling in early years can equalize achievement gaps appears reassuring
considering the significance of the early years for later achievement and social inequality
therein (Heckman & Cunha, 2007; Passaretta et al., 2020).
Statistical artifacts related to test form and scaling are not the only shortcomings of the
SDC. The isolation of school effects in the SCD rests on certain identification assumptions that
are extensively discussed in the previous literature (Downey et al., 2004; Downey, Yoon, &
Martin, 2018). Perhaps the most crucial assumption is the absence of schooling being the only
reason for the change in learning during the summer. The problem with that assumption may
be illustrated well by a parallel stream of literature that examines the effect of schooling on
child obesity. The common finding that children’s body-mass-index grow faster over the
summer than the school year is attributed to compensatory effects of schools’ dietary and
exercising policies (von Hippel, Powell, Downey, & Rowland, 2007; von Hippel & Workman,
2016). Can we maintain that dietary and exercising behavior remain unchanged over seasons?
One might argue that summer months are a breeding ground for unhealthy behaviors and BMI
would have seasonal change even if school was not absent. For example, summer temperatures
may increase ice-cream consumption leading to weight gain among children. Such increase
would be unrelated to the absence of schooling per se but happen to occur in the same season.
If that is the case, one may provocatively argue that the school effect on BMI growth identified
by SCD resembles genuinely an ice-cream effect, at least in part.
The problem is related to omitted variable bias: one cannot rule out that some
peculiarities of the summer months having little to share with schools’ closure impacted the
learning of high and low SES kids differently, thus producing a spurious stronger increase in
SES differentials over the summer break compared to the school year. Obviously, the
proponents of the SCD are aware of the potential danger of assuming no confounding factors
and other important assumptions not mentioned here. At the same time, they posit that those
assumptions are less severe compared to the ones implied by more traditional approaches that,

6

for example, try to isolate school-effects by controlling for all potential non-school factors
(Downey et al., 2018).

AN ALTERNATIVE DESIGN TO IDENTIFY SCHOOLING EFFECTS
The seasonal comparison of learning rates is not the only possible comparison for studying the
effect of school exposure on SES inequality in achievement. An alternative strategy entails
contrasting achievement for children who had the exact same age at testing but experienced
different amounts of schooling throughout their lives. This contrast is constructed by our design
which has its roots in psychological research aimed at identifying the separate contribution of
schooling and ageing for the cognitive development (Carlsson et al., 2015; Cliffordson &
Gustafsson, 2008). We specifically focus on the effects of first-grade schooling but, in principle,
the proposed design may be extended to measure the exposure effect of later grades.
To be sure, ageing and exposure to schooling are almost perfectly colinear. Our design
addresses this issue by exploiting variations in birth dates among children who entered first
grade on the same calendar day and the timing of test administration over the school year.

[FIGURE 2]

Figure 2 illustrates the intuition behind the design. Panel A refers to fictional dates of
birth (𝑇𝑏 ), school start (𝑇𝑠 ), and test administration (𝑇𝑡 ) over calendar time. Imagine two
children born three months apart but started first grade on the same day – Peter and Simon. By
the way the school system is organized, Simon was younger when he started school life. Now
imagine both Peter and Simon taking a cognitive test (resulting in a test score Y) on the same
calendar day after six months into grade one. In this scenario, we would expect Simon to
perform worse than Peter: even though they received the same amount of schooling, Simon was
younger and likely at an earlier maturation point at the day of testing. Now imagine a third child
– Emily – who entered school together with Peter and Simon. Emily also shares Simon’s
birthday, which is exactly three months after Peter’s. However, for random reasons, Emily took
the test exactly three months later in the school year. In this scenario, we would expect Emily
to outperform Peter: even if they had equal age at the day of the test, Emily had received more
schooling by then.

7

Panel B shows the same data over chronological age and makes it apparent that random
variation in month of birth and test date, combined with a constant date of school start, allows
us to separate the effects of ageing and schooling on learning. Comparing children who differed
randomly in age (𝐴𝑡 ) but had the same amount of school exposure (𝐸𝑡 ) at the test day – that is
Peter and Simon – yields information on the effect of age on achievement. Comparing children
of the same age at test who randomly had received a different amount of schooling up to the
test day – that is Peter and Emily – yields information on the contribution of schooling to
achievement. More precisely, in our example, comparing Emily and Peter, who had the same
age at the time of testing, provides us with an estimate for the effect of three months difference
in school exposure on achievement.
An important insight is that variations in age at test day and school exposure up to the
test day depends also on variations in the age at entry into first grade in our design. While we
could make sense of Simon’s lower performance compared to Peter as a direct consequence of
the age difference at testing, Simon was younger at test day because he entered school at a
younger age. In the same way, we could make sense of Emily’s better performance compared
to Peter as a direct consequence of the additional schooling she received. However, Emily
received additional schooling by the day of testing because she entered school life at a younger
age. Thus, the effect of schooling measured by our design is a composite effect driven by
differential exposure to schooling due to differential age at entry. Most school systems feature
fixed school entry dates at the national or regional level combined with cut-off rules that lead
to age-variations among children entering first grade on the same calendar day. Thus, taking
into account such age at entry effects is essential to evaluate the effects of exposure to the school
system. Moreover, one of the most straightforward real-world policies to increase school
exposure in the early years is, indeed, adding schooling before primary school starts. Our design
is therefore particularly relevant for the debate over the effect of policies increasing the early
exposure to formal teaching in the classroom by lowering the school entry age.

A FORMAL APPROACH
We can express the relationships more formally by the following theoretical model
𝑦 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝐸𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝐴𝑡

(1)

8

with 𝑦 denoting student’s expected achievement, 𝐸𝑡 denoting the exposure to the school year
up to the test date, and 𝐴𝑡 denoting age at test date. Age at test date is the difference between
test date (𝑇𝑡 ) and birth date (𝑇𝑏 ). In most assessment data, school exposure can be measured by
the time difference between the test date (𝑇𝑡 ) and the starting date of school (𝑇𝑠 ).
To see why exposure coefficient 𝛽1 (and also age coefficient 𝛽2 ) measure a composite
effect, we can write out a theoretical model in which age at test day (𝐴𝑡 ), age at entry (𝐴𝑠 ), and
school-year exposure (𝐸𝑡 ) have separate effects on achievement (see Cornelissen & Dustman
2019):
𝑦 = 𝜆0 + 𝜆1 𝐸𝑡 + 𝜆2 𝐴𝑡 + 𝜆3 𝐴𝑠

(2)

Since 𝐸𝑡 = 𝑇𝑡 − 𝑇𝑠 , 𝐴𝑡 = 𝑇𝑡 − 𝑇𝑏 , and 𝐴𝑠 = 𝑇𝑠 − 𝑇𝑏 , it follows logically that 𝐴𝑠 =
𝐴𝑡 − 𝐸𝑡 . Replacing 𝐴𝑠 and rearranging terms in Eq. 2 leads to
𝑦 = 𝜆0 + 𝜆1 𝐸𝑡 + 𝜆2 𝐴𝑡 + 𝜆3 (𝐴𝑡 − 𝐸𝑡 )
= 𝜆0 + (𝜆1 − 𝜆3 )𝐸𝑡 + (𝜆2 + 𝜆3 )𝐴𝑡

(3)

which demonstrates the composite nature of the school exposure effect measure 𝛽1 =
𝜆1 − 𝜆3 (as well as the age at test date effect measured by 𝛽2 = 𝜆2 + 𝜆3).
Considering achievement scores of a population of students who have the same age at
test (𝐴𝑡 ), parameter 𝛽1 identifies the expected marginal gain in achievement for the average
individual if she had received more exposure to the school year, which in practice would have
been feasible only by starting school earlier. Hence, 𝛽1 reflects exactly the effect of increasing
exposure to first grade (𝜆1) obtained by starting school earlier in life (–𝜆3 ). We deliberately
conceive age of entry effects as a constituent part of the effects of schooling as they occur in an
actual school system characterized by institutional rules of enrolment that features age
variations among children starting school on the same calendar day.
To identify the model in Eq. 1 in practical applications, we need sufficient variation in
at least two out the three terms: test dates 𝑇𝑡 , dates of school year start 𝑇𝑠 , and birth dates 𝑇𝑏 . In
our empirical case, Germany, we will exploit predominantly variations in test dates and birth
dates since school start is legally fixed and equal for all children (within states). If school start
is fixed (i.e., 𝑇𝑠 is a constant) and if test dates (𝑇𝑡 ) and birth dates (𝑇𝑏 ) are independent to

9

observed and unobserved factors predicting achievement, then age at testing (𝐴𝑡 = 𝑇𝑡 − 𝑇𝑏 )
and school exposure (𝐸𝑡 = 𝑇𝑡 − 𝑇𝑠 ) are independent of those factors too. If these conditions
are met, then our parameter of interest, composite effect 𝛽1 , can be estimated absent of selection
bias.
The ultimate aim of our analysis is testing whether and how socioeconomic status (SES)
gaps in children achievement vary with school exposure effects. We are interested to test if
parameter 𝛽1 is a function of socioeconomic status of the family, which can be expressed by
extending Eq. 1 to include SES and the multiplicative terms with school exposure and age at
test. After rearranging terms, we can write
𝑦 = 𝛽0 + (𝛽1 +𝛽4 ∙SES)𝐸𝑡 + (𝛽2 + 𝛽5 ∙SES)𝐴𝑡 + 𝛽3 ∙SES

(4)

From Eq. 4 we can derive three theoretical scenarios regarding the impact of school
exposure on achievement inequality by family SES. If 𝛽4 < 0 , school exposure had an
equalizing effect on SES related inequality in achievement. If 𝛽4 = 0, then school exposure had
no effect on social achievement inequality (2). Finally, if 𝛽4 > 0, school exposure would
exacerbate achievement inequality. Note that also parameter 𝛽4 captures the composite effect
of differential school exposure achieved by manipulating school entry age (for a formal
demonstration see Appendix A). The methods part will provide more details on the precise
estimation of the theoretical models described by Eq. 1 and 4 in the context of our data.

THE CONTRIBUTION TO A SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE ON SCHOOLING
Starting school life at a younger age is one way to increase the time spent in school. Longer
school days, fewer holidays within the academic term, and school-year extensions into the
summer or the winter break are feasible alternatives for policy making. However, there is no
guarantee that different ways of extending school exposure would be equally effective in terms
of fostering learning and mitigating social gaps therein. Schooling effects depend on out-ofschool counterfactuals (Raudenbush & Eschmann, 2015) and these counterfactuals may vary
depending on age and life stage, season, or even time of the day.
Similar to the SCD, our design considers the impact of school-year exposure rather than
instructional time measured by school days or teaching hours within the academic term (e.g.,
(Carlsson et al., 2015; Cliffordson & Gustafsson, 2008). Both approaches see schools as more

10

than simple providers of instructional time in the classroom, a conceptualization of schooling
frequently found in economic perspectives that quantify school exposure by counting school
and out-of-school days (Carlsson, Dahl, Öckert, & Rooth, 2015; Cliffordson & Gustafsson,
2008). After all, children are exposed to the school system as an institution even during nonschool days within the academic term (for example, when children do homework at home).
By adopting a similar institutional perspective on the role of schools, our approach
provides a viable complement to the SCD. Comparing social inequalities in learning rates
within the school years and the summer months provides an estimate for the impact of extending
the school year into the summer. One may rise doubts if increasing overall school year
exposure, in our case by starting school life earlier, would yield the same result. Hence, our
design complements the SCD insofar as it provides an estimate for the effect of school exposure
as manipulated by starting school life earlier. Thus, both designs may yield different findings
to the extent that different ways of manipulating school exposure (school at younger ages vs.
smaller summer school gap) may generate different results. However, a substantive
interpretation of the differences in the effects of manipulating school exposure via earlier entries
or shorter summer breaks is rendered difficult by potential statistical artifacts and confounding
issues related to the seasonal comparison of learning rates. Compared to SCD, our design is
less prone to confounding and has the advantage of identifying a causal effect based on one
achievement measure only, which reduces data requirements and the risk of statistical artifacts.

DATA AND METHODS
DATA
For studying the effect of schooling on early achievement in Germany we employed nationally
representative data from the Kindergarten Cohort of the German National Educational Panel
Study (hereafter: NEPS). The Kindergarten Cohort covers a sample of children enrolled in
Kindergarten in the years in 2010/2011, around the age of four to five. In Germany, school
starts formally with the first grade of primary school (grade one to four) at around six to seven
years of age. Unlike other countries, Kindergarten is not part of the formal education system
although it has more than 90 per cent attendance rate.
The sample has been followed to the end of primary education (grade 4) and early
secondary education (grade level 5 and 6). Children were tested in various domains but only

11

once in each grade. The original sample (N=2,996) was augmented by a refreshment sample of
6,341 children in Wave 3 (2012), which is the point marking the transition from Kindergarten
to primary education (grade 1).
For the purpose of our article, that is studying the effect of first-grade school exposure,
we drew upon grade one data only (Wave 3).1 We selected first graders in the refreshment
sample only because the original Kindergarten sample suffered from strong attrition between
the last year of Kindergarten and grade one (approximately 85% attrition). The refreshment did
not suffer from any attrition because it was sampled precisely in grade one (Wave 3, school
year 2012/2013). Data collection involved child testing, parent interviews, and teacher and
school headmaster questionnaires. Children were tested in school. There were two test booklets,
one containing math and science tests and the other vocabulary and grammar tests. Testing took
place in two test days in each school and students worked on one test booklet per test day. 2
Schools were randomly assigned to two different time windows for testing: mid of February till
mid of April in 2013 versus mid of May till mid of June in 2013. Thus, testing commenced
after the winter break and ceased before the summer break, when children had already been
into first grade for a minimum of 5-6 months (February) and a maximum of 10 months (June).
The variation in school exposure imposed by variation in testing dates, around slightly less than
6 months of primary schooling, is almost doubled compared to the period of school closure
exploited by the SCD (3 summer months approximately). Although within the assigned time
window schools might have had some discretion in choosing the exact two days of testing, the
overall procedure ensured that the timing of children’s testing is random. In fact, as we will
show later, neither parental SES nor school characteristics predict the day of testing. Parents of
participating children were surveyed via telephone interview. Only one reporting parent (or the
custodian in few cases) was selected for interview.

1

While our design allowed the identification of the effects of exposure to later grades (for example, the exposure

to second or third grade), the latter effects are confounded by summer holidays and hinges on treatments whose
relevance decreases over grades relative to the overall exposure to schooling. Such effects also have different
theoretical meaning and dubitable policy implications, since they hinge on a composite treatment hardly
manipulated by real world policies, that is the differential exposure to second or third grade due to an earlier start
into first grade.

Test booklets were rotated across test days and students randomly assigned to those different test groups.

SAMPLE SELECTION
We selected children from the refreshment sample who participated at school testing and whose
parents participated in the interview (see Table 1 for sample selection logic). After list-wise
deletion of missing values on analytical variables, the sample included 5,481 children.

[TABLE 1]
In general, mandatory schooling in Germany (‘Vollzeitschulpflicht’) commences in the
calendar year children turn six if age six is reached before a certain cut-off date. If they turn six
after the cut-off in that year, school enrolment happens in the subsequent year. Due to the
federal autonomy in German education, the exact cut-off date varies from end of June to end of
September between German federal states and so does also the exact day of school start (see
Table 2). Cut-off dates are fixed within federal states. School start dates are also fixed within
states but do vary across academic years.
For example, in Bavaria, children born in September 2006 had to enter school on September
13, 2012 (school year 2012/2013) because they reached the age of six before the cut-off date
(end of September). Children born a year before, in September 2005, however, were scheduled
to enter school in 2011 (school year 2011/2012). Finally, children born in October 2006 were
scheduled to enter school in 2013 (school year 2013/2014). Parents can apply (but not choose)
for deferring or anticipating enrolment by one year but there is no guarantee of success.
Postponement is more regulated than anticipation and usually occurs only if children had
examined to be physiologically, psychologically, or socio-emotionally unfit for school. In
practice, applications for both anticipation and postponements occur only when children’s age
at the cut-off date is close to the threshold. Nevertheless, an overwhelming majority of children
has regular school enrolments. According to the German national education report for school
year 2012/2013, about 10% of all school enrolments had been irregular enrolments with about
7% postponed and 3% anticipated enrolments (Bildungsbericht 2014).
Based on the cut-off dates, we derived the legally defined birth ranges corresponding to
a compliant school enrolment in the academic year 2012/13 in each of the German Laender.
For example, in Bavaria, all children born between October 2005 and November 2006 were in
the ‘right’ age range at the cut-off date and should have entered primary school on September

13

13, 2012.3 Table 2 provides Laender details on the cut-off dates, school start dates, and the birth
ranges corresponding to a compliant school entry. Around 13% of the children in our sample
were outside the right birth ranges and must have entered first grade in the fall of the previous
(2011 or before) or the following years (2013 or after). Such unregular – early or late – school
enrolment is likely to be associated with factors influencing achievement in school (such as
children’s developmental stage or general school readiness). We excluded those non-compliers
from the analyses because selectivity in age at entry would cause selectivity in school exposure.
Thus, our estimation is based on compliers, i.e. first-grade children in the academic year
2012/13 who had a regular school enrolment.
The sample of compliers (Sample A, N=4,759) included only children whose age at
school entry is defined entirely by the enrolment rules. We know from previous research that,
in practice, it is those children who are just at or close to the upper and lower limits of the ‘right’
birth range at the cut-off date who are most likely to apply for anticipation or postponement
(Mühlenweg & Puhani, 2010). For example, in Bavaria, a child aged exactly 6 at the cut-off
date (born on September 2006) had the choice to apply for a postponed enrollment in 2013/14
and be among the oldest rather than the youngest in the classroom. Conversely, a child aged
exactly 6 years and 11 months at the cut-off date (born on October 2005) was only one month
below the threshold age at the previous year’s cut-off and might have applied for anticipated
enrollment in 2011/12 and be the youngest rather than the oldest in the classroom. Compliers
with the choice to apply for anticipation or deferral might be selective in terms of unobservable
characteristics related to achievement and their parents may have adopted strategic behaviors
aimed at leveraging the school entry age (resulting in endogenous exposure to grade one in our
setting).
To assess how robust our findings are against potential selectivity of those cases, we
constructed alternative and stricter samples that removed from Sample A potential compliers
with the choice to apply for anticipation or deferral in progressive steps. First, Sample B
excluded children who were exactly at the lower (6 years) and upper limit (6 and 11 months)
of the ‘right’ age range at the cut-off date (N=4,042). For example, in Bavaria, Sample B
excludes children born in October 2005 and September 2006. Second, Sample C excluded
additionally those children who were up to one month above (6 and 1 month) or below (6 and
3

In absence of detailed information on birthdays, we assumed all children were born the 15th of the month (14th in

February) as to minimize error.

14

10 months) the limits (N=3,265). Thus, Sample C is the strictest of all three samples. It aims at
including only compliers without choice to apply for anticipation or deferral (i.e., the population
of children for whom either anticipation or postponement of school entry is nearly absent).
Sizes of the three samples vary slightly by outcome as we aimed at maximizing sample size for
each outcome (see Table 3).

[TABLE 2]

COGNITIVE OUTCOMES
We focus on a set of four complementary cognitive domains along the full spectrum of
the fundamental skills thought in primary school: vocabulary, grammar, math, and science.
Math, science, and grammar tests were scaled based on item-response theory (IRT) models
which provide interval scaled scores (WLE scores) best representing children’s abilities (Pohl
and Carstensen 2012). For vocabulary, the NEPS data provided only a sum score. A recent
article pointed out that sum scores are responsible for longitudinal artifacts that have plagued
seminal findings in the SCD literature so far, and suggested IRT scaled tests as superior
alternatives (von Hippel & Hamrock, 2019). However, our study is not affected by scaling
artifacts since we mostly employ IRT-scaled tests and do not compare test scores over time.
Table 3 describes test scores variables in original metrics. For our analyses, we zstandardized test scores for all four domains in each of the samples to have a common mean of
zero and unit standard deviation. Test score reliability was documented to be at .72 and .74 for
math and science respectively. Imperfect reliability inflates test score variance which can lead
to an attenuation bias in estimates for the effects of SES and schooling on z-scores. Thus,
whenever possible, we adjusted test scores for reliability as suggested in Reardon (2011). We
comment on both the unadjusted and, whenever possible, the adjusted results.

SCHOOL EXPOSURE AND AGE AT TESTING
Exposure to first-grade schooling is exogenous only if test dates are independent of SES
and other factors influencing achievement (since 𝐸𝑡 = 𝑇𝑡 − 𝑇𝑠 with 𝑇𝑠 being a constant for
students from the same federal state). Test dates 4 should fulfill such requirements by design as
schools were assigned testing periods and neither first-grade students nor their parents had any
influence on the timing of tests. We can be confident about exogeneity in test dates if test dates
are not predicted by parental SES or school characteristics. Table 4 shows results from
regression models that attempted to predict birth and test dates based on parental SES and class
level characteristics. Results clearly show that, within federal states, test dates were not
predicted by SES nor a wide array of characteristics relating to the social, cognitive, and noncognitive composition of the classrooms and the classroom quality and conditions. 5 The
independence between tests dates and class characteristics is particularly reassuring because,
although assigned to the testing periods, schools might have had some discretion in choosing
the exact dates of testing.
In addition to random tests dates, the exogeneity of age at the day of testing also requires
birth dates to be independent of SES and other factors influencing achievement (since 𝐴𝑡 =
𝑇𝑡 − 𝑇𝑏 ). Birth dates should be exogenous in our samples because we only selected compliers
with the enrolment rules implemented in each federal state. Table 4 shows that this has been
largely the case in our three samples, with the partial exception of parental SES in the overall
sample of compliers (Sample A). However, the SES-birth date association is trivial and, as
expected, even disappears when moving to the more restrictive samples of compliers without
the choice to apply for anticipation or deferral (Sample B and C).
Altogether, selectivity analyses in Table 4 make us confident that, within federal states,
children in our samples randomly differed in school entry age, which resulted in random
variation in age at test and exposure to first-grade schooling. Interestingly, this was the case
even in the overall sample of compliers (Sample A) for which we might have expected some
SES-related age differences at school entry, possibly due to parental strategic behavior. Thus,

4

In absence of information on the exact day of testing, we assumed testing took place the 15th of the month (14th

on February) as to minimize error.

While children tested in the same school may sat in different classrooms, variability across classrooms largely

resembles variability across schools in the NEPS.

16

we mainly comment on the results for sample A but also report findings for more restrictive
samples of compliers without choice to apply for anticipation or deferral (Samples B and C).

[TABLE 4]

SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS OF THE FAMILY
We used the highest parental education and occupational status as proxies for family SES. In
Germany, educational attainment is usually preceding childbirth and comparably stable over
the life course. Occupational status, in contrast, is subject to more fluctuations and also more
prone to measurement error. Thus, we preferred parental education as our primary SES
indicator. We constructed highest parental education by the number of years necessary to attain
the highest educational certificate among the parents (variables for single parents are generated
by NEPS, see Skopek and Munz 2016). Occupational status of parents is measured by the
highest ISEI among parents (Ganzeboom & Treiman, 1996). Both information was provided
by the parent interviews in Wave 3. We report the main analyses for parental education but
results using parental ISEI were very similar and available in Supplementary Figure C1.
Henceforth, we use parental education and SES synonymously. Descriptive statistics for all
variables used in the main analyses are shown in Table 3.

MODELLING APPROACH
Our modelling involves regressing the test scores on school exposure while accounting for
gender, age at test and state fixed effects. The baseline estimation model resembles Eq. 1 in the
theory part:
𝑧𝑖𝑓 = 𝑎0 + 𝑎1 𝐸𝑇𝑖𝑓 + 𝑎2 𝐴 𝑇𝑖𝑓 + 𝑎3 𝑆𝐸𝑆𝑖𝑓 + 𝑎4 𝐺𝐸𝑁𝐷𝐸𝑅𝑖𝑓 + 𝑚𝑓 + 𝑒𝑖𝑓

(5)

where the z-standardized test score of the individual i in federal state f is regressed on gender,
parental SES, age at testing (𝐴 𝑇 ) and the exposure to first-grade schooling up to the testing
(𝐸𝑇 ). In addition, the estimation model includes fixed effects for German federal states (𝑚𝑓 ).
𝐸𝑇 is random only when children are subjected to the same enrolment rules. Hence, accounting

17

for state effects is necessary as both cut-off dates and school start dates vary across German
Laender.
Our main interest lies in studying if SES gaps in achievement increase with exposure to
first grade (keeping age at test constant). Modelling interaction terms in accordance with the
theoretical model described by Eq. 4 provides a direct test for this idea:
𝑧𝑖𝑓 = 𝑏0 + 𝑏1 𝐸𝑇𝑖𝑓 + 𝑏2 𝐴 𝑇𝑖𝑓 + 𝑏3 𝑆𝐸𝑆𝑖𝑓 + 𝑏4 𝐺𝐸𝑁𝐷𝐸𝑅𝑖𝑓 + 𝑏5 𝐸𝑇𝑖𝑓 𝑆𝐸𝑆𝑖𝑓

(6)

+ 𝑏6 𝐴 𝑇𝑖𝑓 𝑆𝐸𝑆𝑖𝑓 + 𝑚𝑓 + 𝑒𝑖𝑓

Equation 5 and 6 were estimated separately for each of the four standardized competence
measures in all three analytical samples (A, B, and C). Variable measuring age at test day,
school exposure at test day and SES are centered in each of the subsamples to ease the
interpretation. Although we did not expect heterogeneity in schooling effects between boys and
girls, estimating (5) and (6) for boys and girls separately put our design to a further test. As a
result, for the main analyses we estimated 108 models for each of the two SES measures.
Furthermore, we run a series of additional and alternative models to ensure the robustness of
our findings. All analyses employed design weights provided by the NEPS.

RESULTS
Table 5 summarizes the main estimates of our analysis obtained for Sample A. The baseline
model (Eq. 5) estimated the main effects of school exposure, age, and years of parental
education (noted by SES) while controlling for gender and federal state differences (fixed
effects). In line with the previous studies on achievement gaps, our results show substantial
SES-gaps among children right at the school start. Coefficients of .15–.20 imply a maximum
gap of 2 standard deviations (SD) across the entire range of parental education (10 years of
parental education). The gap seems somewhat lower in math (.15) compared to grammar (.18),
vocabulary (.18), and science (.17). As expected, reliability-adjusted math and science scores
show somewhat larger gaps. Overall, SES effects on scores are substantial and, despite minor
differences, pretty consistent across all domains. To facilitate interpretation, these SEScoefficients are plotted in the upper panel of Figure 3 (Columns A), which also provides
coefficient plots based on the more restrictive Samples B and C for comparison (compliers
without choice to apply for anticipation or deferral).

18

[TABLE 5]

Table 5 also provides clear evidence for the positive effects of school exposure and age
at test on child achievement. School effects are statistically significant across the board.
Notably, schooling exposure has larger effects on math and science than on vocabulary and
grammar. For example, one additional month of schooling increases math scores by about 12%
of a SD (14% for reliability adjusted scores) whereas it increases vocabulary scores only by 3%
of a SD (see Table 5, Eq.5). In contrast to schooling effects, age effects are somewhat more
consistent across domains and comparably small (in the case of math and science): one month
of age is associated with 3 to 5% of a SD higher scores. Age and school effects are similar for
vocabulary and grammar. Note that our approach implies both school and age effects to add up
on children’s growth in cognitive development and learning. For example, based on our
estimates, after 10 months of being in first grade an average child’s vocabulary score is
expected to increase by 73% of a standard deviation, and more than one third of that increase
is explained by the exposure to schooling. The equivalent for math was a score growth by 1.6
SDs with schooling explaining three fourth of it. Figure 3 (upper panel, Column B) shows that
schooling effects were statistically identical for the more restrictive samples of compliers
(Samples B and C). Age effects were also similar in the more restrictive samples of compliers
(see supplementary Figure C2).
Can test scale differences (sum scores vs. IRT scales) explain our findings of domainspecific school exposure effects? We believe this scenario is unlikely. Vocabulary and grammar
– both sub-dimensions of German language competency – differ in test scaling but we find age
and school effects being similar for both domains. Moreover, age effects are similar across
different domains and different test scales. If scaling was fully responsible for the patterns of
results across domains, it would have been extremely unlikely to find similar age and schooling
effects for vocabulary and grammar and similar age effects in all domains. Finally, schooling
effects on grammar are substantially lower than math and science even though all three tests
were IRT scaled.
Having ruled out methodical artifacts, we can at this point only speculate on substantive
explanations for why we find comparably smaller schooling effects on language-related
domains. Like math and science contents, vocabulary and grammar training form part of the

19

curriculum in first-grade primary school (subject “Deutsch” in which children also learn to read
and write). However, since language development is a generally robust process that happens
very early in life (Shonkoff & Phillips, 2000), it might be possible that language skills are less
malleable through instruction in school at later ages. Saturation effects may also play a role
since language competencies are acquired long before school while more technical skills of
math and science are typically learned in school. Furthermore, peer-group mechanisms (Justice,
Petscher, Schatschneider, & Mashburn, 2011) and school segregation along social lines – and
thus indirectly school and classroom segregation by prior language skills – could also explain
weaker schooling effects on language. Whereas further research may address those specific
questions, our findings do underline the importance of differentiating learning domains when
examining schooling effects.
Our main purpose was to test if schooling effects differed by parental SES. Table 5
provides results on our models that included interaction terms (see Eq. 6). Figure 3 (upper panel,
Column C) visualizes interaction coefficients between school exposure and SES (interaction
coefficients between age and SES are shown in Supplementary Figure C2). Results regarding
the SES-schooling interaction are clear-cut; there are no signs of any meaningful interaction
effect for any domain, implying that schooling effects do not vary by parental SES. In other
words, exposure to first-year schooling does not seem to modify any of the SES gaps found in
the various domains, thus suggesting that all children – regardless of their parental background
– benefit from schooling alike. When it comes to the SES-age interaction we find mixed
evidence (see Table 5 and Supplementary Figure C2); while not being statistically significant
at conventional levels for vocabulary, grammar, and math, age effects do depend on SES for
science. Estimates in Table 5 imply, for example, that the unadjusted SES gap in science
between children differing in four years of parental education would have grown from
approximately 69 to 97% of a SD over a 10-months period and independent of school exposure.
Hence, SES gaps in science might be growing over first grade, but this seems due to factors
related to ageing and not school exposure itself. Estimates for the stricter samples of compliers
are almost identical (Samples B and C).
We run all analyses using parental ISEI as measure for SES. Results are nearly identical
to the ones reported here (see Supplementary Figure C1). We also tested for gender differences
in the effects by running our models for boys and girls separately (middle and lower panels of
Figure 3). In short, we could not detect meaningful differences in the inspected relationships

20

by gender. Although there was somewhat more uncertainty about the presence of schooling
effects on grammar and vocabulary in those separated samples, our general conclusions about
the absence of school exposure effects on SES-inequality apply to boys and girls equally. All
in all, our results clearly suggest that first-grade schooling did not reduce or increase SESinequality in educational achievement. Exposure to schooling seems to improve educational
achievement in all skill domains but not to have any impact on SES-related inequalities in any
of those domains.

[FIGURE 3]

FURTHER ROBUSTNESS ANALYSES
We ran additional analyses to ensure the robustness of our findings. First of all, we estimated
Eq. 5 and 6 including an indicator for migration background among the covariates (at least one
parent not born in Germany) and, when relevant, also the multiplicative terms between the
migration indicator and school exposure and age at test, respectively. While being more
consumptive, these augmented models may reflect sharper theoretical measures for SES
inequalities as migrant families are usually overrepresented in the low tail of SES distribution.
Results from the augmented models fully confirm our general conclusions (see Supplementary
Figure D1 and D2 for parental education and parental ISEI respectively). As expected, SES
gradients in achievement are somewhat lower compared Figure 3, but those social inequalities
are still astoundingly strong and unchanged by school exposure.
We additionally estimated Eq. 5 by grouping children in three (state-specific) groups
which are equally spaced in terms of their age of entry into first grade (specifying entry age in
a linear fashion would be inestimable, as discussed in the theoretical part). The estimation of
school exposure effects in the augmented models hinges on the comparison among children
with reduced variations in their entry age. On the downside, this strategy also dramatically
reduces variation in school exposure by construction, thus representing a strict test for our
design. Analogously, we added entry age dummies and their interactions terms with school
exposure and age at entry to Eq. 6. Adding entry age dummies increases uncertainty around the
estimates of school exposure effects, reduce slightly their magnitude, but leave interaction
terms with SES unchanged (see Supplementary Figure D3 and D4 for parental education and

21

parental ISEI respectively). Hence, our general findings are supported by the data even when
reducing variations in school entry age and, therefore, exposure to first-grade schooling.

CONCLUSIONS
Decades of research has suggested that schooling acts as an institution ameliorating social
inequality in learning. Learning in home environments is so heavily dependent on the socioeconomic position of the parents that even unequal school systems contribute to equalization.
These ideas have mainly arisen from the observation that social gaps in achievement grow faster
during the summer break – when schools are closed – compared to the school year.
But does schooling actually reduce social inequality in educational achievements? This
article answered this question looking at the role of first-grade schooling in the German context
education. The equalizing potential of schools in the early years of life is crucial in all
institutional contexts but particularly in Germany, where most of the social differences in
achievement contributing to track allocation at age 10 are produced right at the school start. If
first-grade schooling reduced those early inequalities, such equalization effect would foster
fairness in the track allocation process and contribute to equalization in later life chances.
We proposed a design to identify causal effects of school exposure that exploits random
variation of birth dates of children entering school on the same calendar day and test dates in
assessment studies. Notably, the proposed design complements the predominant seasonal
comparison design which has been used in the US literature on schooling effects. In contrast,
our design is less data consumptive by requiring only one instead of four points of skill
measurement at the minimum. We applied this design to most recent educational data from the
German National Educational Panel Study and studied school exposure effects on first-grade
students.
Our findings on the impact of schooling on achievement inequality are clear-cut: We
found no effect of first-grade schooling on social gaps in achievement in a series of skill
domains. Gaps in achievement between children from higher versus lower social backgrounds
were the same irrespective of the time they had been exposed to first-grade schooling. Even
though we found clear evidence for schooling to facilitate learning, our study could not find
any evidence that it does so at different rates for children of different social backgrounds. Thus,
we conclude that schooling in Germany neither equalizes nor exacerbates social inequality in

22

achievement, at least in the first grade. One can argue schooling is beneficial for all children at
comparable rates.
This article challenges older findings from seasonal comparisons studies that found
equalizing effects of schooling in the US and other European countries and accord with more
recent accounts that questioned those earlier findings based on methodological shortcomings
(von Hippel & Hamrock, 2019b; von Hippel et al., 2018).
We would like to stress that our results do not necessarily stand in contrast with the
seasonal comparison literature. One possibility is that extending first-grade schooling by
anticipating school life bears no consequences for social inequality in achievement while
extending first grade into the summer break may indeed ameliorate such inequalities. It is
difficult to assess whether such a scenario is likely, however. We are left to wonder whether
the common findings in seasonal comparison research relates to the absence of schooling or
other things happening over the summer that are not at all related to the school closure. For
example, favorable weather conditions in the summer make contacts with friends in the
neighborhood more likely even outside school hours, and those interactions may well be
consequential for differential learning by social background. Such potential seasonal
‘neighborhood effects’ – not caused by but associated to the school absence – could sneak into
‘schooling effects’ identified by the seasonal design. While von Hippel & Hamrock (2019)
recently put into question the previous empirical evidence based on potential artifacts due to
scaling and changing test form, they still reason within a seasonal framework suffering from
potential omitted variable bias, and still find an equalizing effect of schools in the early years
of life. Confounding issues, together with issues of scaling and changing test form that affects
longitudinal comparisons, are eliminated in our design. Furthermore, by its parsimony in terms
of data requirements, our design may facilitate cross-national research on schooling effects
which could address the important question of whether and to which extent schooling effects
might be shaped by features of the larger macro context of countries and education systems.
A first naïve look at our findings may shed hopes on the consequences of school closures
in the midst of the current COVID-19 pandemic. If schools do not impact inequality, we may
expect school closure under COVID-19 to slower learning of children from different social
background equally. However, the current crisis resulted in a peculiar out-of-school
counterfactual. In many countries, the pandemic kicked in right at the middle of the school year
2019/20 and teaching continued remotely and online, and in many cases through the direct

23

involvement of the parents. It is unclear how such a peculiar situation of school absence
matches with the counterfactuals as constructed by the seasonal comparison design and our
design. Summer often coincides with holidays and parents are not necessarily focused on
building up their children’s curricula during holidays (Von Hippel, 2020). After all, parents
outsource most of the teaching to schools and those schools will soon reopen their doors. Early
years of life are an unexpected analogy: while not on vacation, parents usually do not rush
children’s learning right before the school start precisely because the school will soon start. The
spreading fear is that school closures under COVID-19 will indeed sharpen social differences
in learning as parents acted as home teachers whose effectiveness is likely to change across
social strata. Furthermore, remote teaching comes at the disadvantage of those with limited
access to broadbands and technological devices. Reliable data to assess the consequence of
school closure under the COVID-19 pandemic is not yet available but we agree with other
colleagues that the prospects are not encouraging (Defeyter et al., 2020; von Hippel, 2020).
Social scientists will find ways to assess the consequence of COVID-19 for SES-inequality in
achievement but the extent to which such consequences will relate to school closures per se is
rather unclear. Even if future research will succeed in isolating school closure effects from other
COVID-19 related factors, such effects would refer to a very peculiar out-of-school
counterfactual that does not reflect life in non-pandemic historical periods. Hence, COVID-19
based designs will not be perfect when it comes to assess the effects of schooling under normal
circumstances as much as our design is not perfect when it comes to assessing schooling effects
under COVID-19.
We believe our results may help to reframe the way sociologists and policy makers think
of schooling as an institution fostering equity and helping children from socioeconomically
disadvantaged backgrounds to catch up with their more advantaged peers. The Coleman report
in the early 60s stressed the greater importance of non-school factors compared to school factors
in shaping social inequality in learning. Starting from the 60s, seasonal designs have
substantiated such perspective and repeatedly argued that, “when it comes to inequality by
socioeconomic status, schools are more part of the solution than the problem” (Downey and
colleagues 2004, p.616). Most recent studies have already brought up skepticism towards those
earlier assertions. Our study substantiates such skepticism and challenges over-optimistic ideas
about schooling as being a social ‘equalizer’; rather we point to the possibility that schooling
might be wholly agnostic when it comes to social inequality in achievement. Thus, we might

24

re-address the issue by arguing that, when it comes to inequality by socioeconomic family
background, schools are likely neither the problem nor part of the solution – at least when it
comes to the first year of schooling.

APPENDIX
A.

COMPOSITE EXPOSURE EFFECT ON SES-INEQUALITY: DEMONSTRATION

Imagine a theoretical model in which age at test day (𝐴𝑡 ), age at entry (𝐴𝑠 ), and school-year
exposure (𝐸𝑡 ) have separate SES-specific effects on achievement:
𝑦 = 𝛾0 + 𝛾1 𝐴𝑡 + 𝛾2 𝐴𝑠 + 𝛾3 𝐸𝑡 + 𝛿0 𝑆𝐸𝑆 + 𝛿1 (𝑆𝐸𝑆∙𝐴𝑡 ) + 𝛿2 (𝑆𝐸𝑆∙𝐴𝑠 )

(A1)

+ 𝛿3 (𝑆𝐸𝑆∙𝐸𝑡 )

Rearranging the terms in Eq. A1 we obtain:
𝑦 = 𝛾0 + (𝛾1 + 𝛿1 𝑆𝐸𝑆)𝐴𝑡 + (𝛾2 + 𝛿2 𝑆𝐸𝑆)𝐴𝑠 + (𝛾3 +𝛿3 𝑆𝐸𝑆)𝐸𝑡 + 𝛿0 𝑆𝐸𝑆
(A2)

Replacing 𝐴𝑠 with 𝐴𝑠 = 𝐴𝑡 − 𝐸𝑡 (remember that 𝐸𝑡 = 𝑇𝑡 − 𝑇𝑠 , 𝐴𝑡 = 𝑇𝑡 − 𝑇𝑏 , and 𝐴𝑠 = 𝑇𝑠 −
𝑇𝑏 ) and rearranging terms in Eq. A2 leads to:
𝑦 = 𝛾0 + (𝛾1 + 𝛿1 𝑆𝐸𝑆)𝐴𝑡 + (𝛾2 + 𝛿2 𝑆𝐸𝑆)∙(𝐴𝑡 − 𝐸𝑡 ) + (𝛾3 +𝛿3 𝑆𝐸𝑆)𝐸𝑡
+ 𝛿0 𝑆𝐸𝑆

(A3)

Corresponding to:
𝑦 = 𝛾0 + (𝛾1 + 𝛿1 𝑆𝐸𝑆 + 𝛾2 +𝛿2 𝑆𝐸𝑆)𝐴𝑡 + (𝛾3 + 𝛿3 𝑆𝐸𝑆 − 𝛾2 −𝛿2 𝑆𝐸𝑆)𝐸𝑡
+ 𝛿0 𝑆𝐸𝑆
and
𝑦 = 𝛾0 + {(𝛾1 + 𝛾2 ) + (𝛿1 +𝛿2 )𝑆𝐸𝑆)}𝐴𝑡 + {(𝛾3 − 𝛾2 ) + (𝛿3 −𝛿2 )𝑆𝐸𝑆}𝐸𝑡
(A4)

+ 𝛿0 𝑆𝐸𝑆

Equation A4 makes it clear that the school exposure effect we estimate is a function of (1) the
difference in the main effects of the school exposure and age of entry (𝛾3 − 𝛾2 ), (2) the level
of SES, and (3) the difference of the interaction effects between school exposure and SES and
age of entry and SES, respectively (𝛿3 − 𝛿2 ).
37

When we focus on SES-gradients in our model, we obtain:
𝛿𝑦
= 𝛿0 + (𝛿1 + 𝛿2 )∙𝐴𝑡 + (𝛿3 − 𝛿2 )∙𝐸𝑡
𝛿𝑆𝐸𝑆

(A5)

If we increase school exposure, the estimated SES gradient is:
𝛿𝑦
= 𝛿3 − 𝛿2
𝛿𝑆𝐸𝑆 𝛿𝐸𝑡
