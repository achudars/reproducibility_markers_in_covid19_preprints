"14" "Abstract"
"15" "Transportation disruptions caused by COVID-19 have exacerbated difficulties in health care delivery and access, which may lead to changes in health care use. This study uses mobile device data from  SafeGraph  to explore the temporal patterns of visits to health care points of interest (POIs) during 2020 and examines how these patterns are associated with socio-demographic and spatial characteristics at the block group level in North Carolina. Specifically, using the k-medoid time-series clustering method, we identify three distinct types of temporal patterns of visits to health care POI. Furthermore, by estimating the multinomial logit models, we find that socio-demographic and spatial characteristics are strongly correlated with both the intensity and trend of medical visits during the pandemic. The results suggest that the ability to conduct in-person medical visits during the pandemic has been unequally distributed, which highlights the importance of tailoring policy strategies for specific socio-demographic groups to ensure health care delivery and access in a timely, equitable, and safe manner."

"17" "Introduction"
"18" "Transportation is widely recognized as  critical factor in  health care access (Syed et al., 2013). Nearly 5.8 million Americans in 2017 reported delaying medical care because of a lack of transportation options (Wolfe et al., 2020). COVID-19 has significantly disrupted transport and health systems. Early indications are that these changes, combined with lockdown requirements and a desire to limit exposure, reduced access to healthcare. For example, 35% of US adults reported delaying health care because of COVID-19 (Household Pulse Survey, 2020, May) and many news outlets have reported decreases in preventive services (e.g., Smith, 2020; Martin et al., 2021)."
"19" "In response to COVID-19, health care systems implemented policies that made accessing care both harder and easier. During the initial months of the pandemic, most systems eliminated or significantly reduced access to elective or non-emergency services. Hospitals also placed restrictions on whether patients could have individuals accompany them to appointments. While these policies reduced access to in-person healthcare, providers and insurers increased support for telemedicine visits (Chen et al., 2021;  Medicare Telemedicine,  2020). COVID-19 also disrupted transportation options. Shared mobility options including fixed-route transit, paratransit, and ride-hailing, became less available as agencies and firms decreased service in response to safety concerns and ridership declines (Hu & Chen, 2021; APTA, 2021)."
"20" "The purpose of this study is to assess the impacts of COVID-19 on visits to healthcare facilities in North Carolina. We do this by using mobile device data from  SafeGraph  to identify visits to health care facilities and then use time-series clustering to identify block groups exhibiting similar medical trip making patterns during 2020. We then examine the association between these temporal patterns and the socio-demographic and spatial characteristics of block groups in North Carolina. The findings reveal social and spatial inequalities in health care  use  before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of our work, we also assess the reliability of the mobile device data."
"21" "The research contributes to existing studies on the impacts of the pandemic on activity-travel behavior in two aspects. First, mobile phone data provides a viable data source to capture large-scaled human mobility and has been widely used to map mobility patterns and identify activity hotspots during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, few studies (e.g., Atkinson et al., 2020) have checked the quality of mobile phone data to measure mobility. As a result, it is difficult to know the validity of these findings. Our study validates the use of mobile phone data to measure mobility patterns and activities by using weekly pattern data from  SafeGraph , specifically for health care related activities. Second, the research examines the correlation between socio-demographic and spatial characteristics and medical visits during the pandemic. A better understanding of these associations could inform the design of appropriate policies to deliver health care service in a safe, equitable, and timely manner."
"22" "Background"
"23" "2.1  Health care services during COVID-19"
"24" "The COVID-19 pandemic drastically changed peoples’ access to and use of health care services. These changes include health insurance loss, health facility closure, and the increasing use of telemedicine (Chen et al., 2021). During the pandemic, more than 40 million Americans lost their jobs, which further caused many of them to lose their employer-based health insurance (Blumenthal et al., 2020). As a result, they may be forced to delay necessary but noncritical treatments (Blumenthal et al., 2020). These impacts also tend to be disproportionately distributed. Minorities and people with low educational attainment and low-income have experienced disproportionate job loss and delayed care ( Kurtzleben , 2020)."
"25" "The pandemic also caused significant economic threats to the viability of some health care providers, especially those located in rural and poor communities (Blumenthal et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021).  The pre-existing accessibility to health care facilities in rural and poor communities is comparatively lower ( Ghorbanzadeh  et al.,2021;  Guida  &  Carpentieri , 2021).  Many providers were temporarily closed during the pandemic, which may have  further decreased  geographic  access to local health care and further influenced health care use."
"26" "Telemedicine is another key change in health care services. Many health care systems increased telemedicine options for patients during the pandemic. Health insurers also expanded their coverage to include telemedicine. With these changes, the use of telemedicine increased significantly during the pandemic to replace in-person care (Mann et al., 2020). However, not everyone has equal access to telemedicine. People with limited internet access, language barriers, and cognitive limitations may not be able to use telemedicine, and telemedicine is not suitable for all medical services (Chen et al., 2021)."
"27" "2.2  Transportation during COVID-19"
"28" "Transportation provides access to health care. Despite the increasing popularity of telemedicine, transportation is still important for people who need in-person care. Thus, the pandemic’s disruptions of travel demand  and transportation services  may influence health care access and u se . In response to stay-at-home orders and social distancing regulations, travel demand decreased (Dasgupta et al., 2020; Pepe et al., 2020). People may also have reduced their health care trips, delayed their medical care visits, or used telemedicine to meet critical health care needs (Cochran, 2020). Others may have had more time and flexibility to commit to conducting  health care activities because of their flexible work schedules. Mobility reduction  also  varies among different socio-demographic groups and geographic locations (Dasgupta, 2020; Pepe et al., 2020; McLaren 2020). Thus, the ability to conduct and restrict medical trips may also vary among people with different social-demographic characteristics and living in different geographic locations. Neighborhoods with higher percentages of minorities and people with low income and low educational attainment tended to show less reduction in mobility because of their inability to work remotely   (Dasgupta, 2020; Pepe et al., 2020; McLaren 2020). People living in urban areas maintained higher mobility levels compared to people living in rural areas (Jones, 2020). Population density is positively associated with more mobility reduction (Do Lee et al., 2020)."
"29" "T ransportation s ervices  also changed. Nationally, public transit ridership dropped by 80% at the start of the pandemic and remained approximately 60% below compared to 2019 levels (APTA, 2021). Public transit agencies cut service because of reduced ridership and revenues. For example, in response to reduced revenues, Los Angeles’ transit agency (LA Metro) cut their budget by 1.2 billion and service by 20% (Los Angeles Times, 2020). MARTA, in the Atlanta region, cut most of its bus routes in April and is still operating at low capacity. King County Metro in Seattle cut service by 15% in September (Bellis, 2020). Ride-sourcing programs, such as Uber and Lyft, suspended their pooled and shared ride options in response to the spread of COVID-19. Changes in public transit and ride-hailing programs left some people, particularly those who rely more on transit and shared rides, such as individuals with disabilities (Cochran, 2020), facing greater challenges accessing transportation and health care."
"30" "2.3  Mobile  p hone  d ata in  m easuring  m obility"
"31" "Mobile phone data, which consist of Call Detail Records or Global Position System data, have been widely used in transportation research. These data offer a rich source of information on continuous space–time geography in urban areas. These data have been used to develop human mobility models (e.g., Deville et al., 2016), to develop traffic models (e.g.,  Demissie  et al., 2018; Breyer et al., 2018), and to estimate trip rates (e.g. ,   Çolak  et al., 2015)."
"32" "Because mobile phone data can capture large-scale human mobility patterns, it also has been used in COVID-19 related studies to map human mobility patterns (e.g., Gao et al., 2020), identify activity hotspots (e.g., Li et al., 2021), and set parameters for disease transmission models (e.g., Change et al., 2020). Although mobile phone data has been popular in mobility studies, limited studies ( Atkinson et al., 2020 ) have assessed the accuracy and reliability of these data to measure travel and activity patterns."
"33" "Data"
"34" "We obtained data on visits to medical facilities in North Carolina from  SafeGraph , a data company that tracks mobile device visits to points of interest (POIs) across the United States and Canada using the global positioning system (GPS). Information on medical visits was obtained from  SafeGraph’s  Core Places and Weekly Patterns datasets which contain data on the characteristics of POIs along with estimates of number of visits and visitors to each POI and the home census block group of each visitor.  SafeGraph  defines each device’s home as the most common nighttime location over a six-week period."
"35" "We analyzed the aggregated visits to different types of health care facilities.  Medical facility POIs are  usually  concentrated spatially,  especially in urban areas.  Thus, it is difficult to  accurately measure  visits to each medical facility POI. Furthermore, multiple medical POIs are usually identified for a large medical facility. For example,  POIs of office  of  physicians  are  inaccurately  identified within the building boundary of the Duke University Hospital. The se  POI data issue s  further  challenge the accuracy of assigning visits to each medical POI and differentiating visits to different types of medical facilities. We selected medical facility POIs with the designation “office of physicians (NAICS code 621111)”, “office of dentists (NAICS code 621210), “office of other health practitioners (NAICS code 6213), “office of outpatient care centers” (NAICS code 6214), and “general medical and surgical hospitals” (NAICS code 622110) (see  Appendix  for details)  for analysis . The study period spans 52 weeks from January 6, 2020, to the week starting on December 28, 2020."
"36" "We used American Community Survey (ACS) 2019 5-Year Estimates to measure socio-demographic and economic characteristics at the census block group level. We included metrics in six domains: (1) gender; (2) age; (3) race and ethnicity; (4) education; (5) economic status; and (6) transportation disadvantage. We also integrated percent of the population without internet access, and percent of commuters working at home as proxy measures for the potential of using telemedicine."
"37" "For spatial variables, we used the urban-rural classification scheme from the National Center for Health Statistics to categorize block groups into six types: large central metropolitan, large fringe metropolitan, medium metropolitan, small metropolitan, micropolitan, or noncore county. We also calculated population density for each block group, defined as the number of people per square mile. We further used the medical POI data to derive the measure of density of health care facilities, defined as the count of the number of health care facilities per square mile for each block group."
"38" "Methods"
"39" "Our study aimed to assess the reliability of  SafeGraph  data for analyzing trips to medical facilities and patterns of travel to medical facilities during 2020."
"40" "Reliability of  SafeGraph   d ata"
"41" "To assess the reliability of  SafeGraph  data, we used three approaches. First, we estimated sample geographic representativeness by comparing the number of sampled devices with 2019 Census Bureau population counts at different geographic levels, from the block group, census tract, county and state levels. Using American Community Survey 2019 5-year estimates, we also estimated the expected demographic characteristics of sampled devices and compared to state averages. Second, we compared  SafeGraph  medical facility POIs with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) list of health care providers (CMS, 2020) to check the accuracy and representativeness of medical facility POIs. Third, we compared and correlated  SafeGraph  estimates of medical facility visit volumes with the in-person visit volume to select facilities under UNC Health Care System. The in-person encounter visit volume data was obtained from Carolina Data Warehouse for Health."
"42" "4.2  Analysis of  t emporal  t ravel  t rends for  m edical  f acilities"
"43" "We conducted several preprocessing steps on the medical visitor flow data to ensure that block groups contained sufficient and valid records to derive stable estimates of visitors for analyzing temporal patterns. We removed block groups with zero population, as sampled devices in block groups with zero population are likely to be misidentified.  The  number of devices in some block groups dropped significantly across 2020 from thousands or hundreds to only a few. To address this, we included block groups where weekly counts of sampled devices were at least 2% of the census block group’s population and removed block groups with fewer than 10 sampling devices. The analysis results are not sensitive to our selection of cut points.  Our final preprocessing yielded 52 weeks of data for 5,565 of the 6,155 North Carolina block groups. The number of devices sampled in the  SafeGraph  data varies each week. Because of this, we normalized medical visitor counts by the reported number of devices and focused our analysis on the percent of devices making medical trips each week."
"44" "To identify patterns in medical care visits during the pandemic, we employed time series clustering. This approach identifies block groups that displayed similar temporal trends in medical care visits during 2020 (Das et al., 1998). Time series clustering partitions time series data into clusters based on a similarity measure. We chose a distance measure based on dynamic time warping (DTW), with a window size of 1 for wrapping. Thus, when calculating the distance between  and  , we considered all points between  and   (Three weeks). We selected DTW with a small window size of 1 because it allowed us to compare both the similarity in time and the shape of time-series data."
"45" "To identify the cluster prototype or cluster representation, we used partition around medoids (PAM). We also experimented with two other common cluster prototypes and partitional algorithms, k-mean, and barycenter averaging (DBA). Our visual comparison of the clustering methods showed that PAM presented better clustering results. In PAM, the center of a cluster is defined as a representative sequence which minimizes the sum of squared DTW distance to other objects within the cluster. The distance is calculated using DTW. We then apply the k-Medoid partitional clustering algorithm by (1) specifying the number of clusters k; (2) selecting k samples from time-series objects as the initial center of the k clusters; (3) assigning each object to the nearest center based on the DTW distance; (4) finding the center within each cluster, the object with the minimum average DTW distance to the remaining objects; and (5) repeating steps (3) and (4) until none of the objects change their cluster memberships."
"46" "In this study, we present results with three clusters. We selected k=3 by running the DTW distance-based K-Medoid clustering algorithm with values of k from 2 to 6. The clustering outcomes of different numbers of clusters were visually compared and explored (see Appendix for detailed results). We selected the value of  k=3  with better clustering results."
"47" "We characterized differences across time-series clusters by comparing socioeconomic characteristics using unadjusted (ANOVA) and adjusted (multinomial logit regression) approaches."
"48" "Results"
"49" "5.1  Reliability of  SafeGraph   m edical  f acilities  d ata"
"50" "The  SafeGraph  sample averaged 631,835 devices during 2020. The proportion of population sampled ( sampled device counts /state population) ranged from 4.5-8% 2020 (Figure 1). The  number of sampling devices decreased significantly during the lockdown period (from Mid-March to May).  SafeGraph  sources data from phone applications, such as navigation and social media apps, where people could opt into location tracking. Thus, stay-at-home orders may decrease the use of apps with location tracking and therefore decrease the number of sampled devices. At the county level, the sample averaged 6,318 devices (6% of population; IQR 5%-7%). At the census tract level, the sample averaged 287 devices (6% of total population; IQR 5%-7%). At the census block group level, the sample averaged 102 devices (6% of total population; IQR 4%-8%). The correlation coefficients between average device counts and Census population estimates ranged from 0.98 to 0.99 at the county level, 0.77 to 0.85 at the census tract level, and 0.72 to 0.83 at the block group level. The ratio of devices to census population also varied spatially with the ratio being higher in metropolitan areas compared to non-metropolitan areas (Figure 2)."

"52" "Figure 2: Ratio of  mean  weekly sampled device  counts  in 2020 to the population from the ACS 2019 estimates at block group level. NA represents zero population."
"53" "We analyzed how closely the device data matched state demographic averages by assuming that sampled devices in a block group have the same demographic characteristics as the block group. In terms of age composition, the weekly device sample across 2020 is slightly over-represented for the over age 45 while under-represented below age 45. But overall, the device sample is well- sampled across age groups. The sample is generally over-represented on White s  but under-represented on non-White s  (those identifying as Blacks and Hispanics). The sample is generally well-sampled for educational attainment categories. It is slightly over-represented on higher education levels and under-represented on those with high school degrees or below. The sample is under-represented for lower household income categories (annual income between $15,000 and $35,000, and less than $15,000) and over-represented for higher household income categories (income between $50,000 and $100,000, and higher than $100,000)."

"125" "Compared with the CMS list of medical facilities, the spatial distribution of medical POIs from  SafeGraph  is well-balanced. The distribution of medical facilities at the county level derived from both datasets is similar; counties with a higher number of CMS providers also have a higher number of medical facility POI from the  SafeGraph  dataset (Pearson correlation coefficient=0.89). There are no medical facilities in 594 census tracts (27%), based on the two datasets. 42 tracts have one or two CMS providers, which are not identified in the  SafeGraph  POI. There are no medical facilities in 3,316 block groups (54%), based on both datasets. 107 block groups have one or two CMS providers, which are not identified in  SafeGraph  POI. The correlation coefficients at the census tract and block group levels are moderate,  at  0.58 and 0.54, respectively. Besides, as mentioned above, health facility POIs are usually concentrated spatially, and multiple POI points are often identified for the large medical facilities. The data  issues may contribute to the moderate correlation coefficients (0.58 at the tract level and 0.54 at the block group level) at the tract and block group levels."
"126" "Overall, trends of medical facility visit from  SafeGraph  and UNC Health Care System are comparable, exhibiting similar temporal patterns (Figure 3). The number of medical visits started to drop in the middle of March when North Carolina’s governor declared a State of Emergency and reached their lowest values in early April. Visits to facilities  under  UNC Health Care System dropped more (over 70%)  during the lockdown period  than visits measured from  Safe Gr aph  data. Most medical facilities under UNC Health Care Systems are in the central urban areas, where social distancing measures were more likely to be enforced. In May, when the stay-at-home order was  lifted  and North Carolina entered Phase 2, medical claims and medical visits both recovered. The correlation coefficient between the two groups is strong, at 0.83."
"127" "Figure 3: Temporal trends of medical facility visit change."
"128" "Note: Visits to facilities under UNC health Care System are available  until  the week starting on 12/7/2020. Two lines represent the percent change in visits (UNC Health Care System) and visits per device ( SafeGraph ) since the first week of 2020."
"129" "Based on these assessments, we concluded that overall  SafeGraph  data are well-balanced in terms of geographic and demographic representativeness of population but  slightly  under-represented in minority and low-income groups and have a well-balanced sampling of POIs. The aggregated trends in medical visits somewhat matched up to the aggregated trends in medical claims. However, we still need to be cautious that  SafeGraph  data have a limited coverage in outlying rural areas, limited representativeness in low-income populations who often have limited access to smart phones with GPS, limited accuracy of POI location identification, and limited coverage for POIs of small size. As a result, medical visits derived from  SafeGraph  by low-income people, and medical visits to small size hospital POIs, especially in rural areas, may not be accurately recorded in  SafeGraph  data."
"130" "Temporal  p atterns of  m edical  f acility  v isits"
"131" "We identified three clusters of block groups that exhibited similar temporal trends for trips to medical facilities. Medical care visits of block groups in all three clusters dropped at the start of the pandemic and did not return to pre-pandemic levels."
"132" "Cluster 1 .  B lock groups  in this cluster  have lower medical visits all the time. These block groups also responded to the lockdown in April with a reduction in medical visits.  As  the COVID-19 restrictions were gradually lifted, these block groups experience d  a  moderate   and slow  increase in medical visits."
"133" "Cluster 2.  Compared to block groups in cluster 1 (n=1,877) and 3 (n=2,516), block groups in  this  cluster (n=1,172) responded to the stay-at-home orders implemented in March and April strongly; block groups in  this cluster  saw a significant decrease (over 50%) in medical visits during the lockdown period.  When North Carolina implemented re-opening phase in May, medical visits bounced back soon  but were lower than pre-pandemic levels ."
"134" "Cluster 3.   Compared to block groups in cluster 2, block groups in  this  cluster experienced a moderate decrease in medical visits during the lockdown period and a moderate  and low  increase."

"141" "Block groups in the three clusters are significantly different on all selected socio-demographic variables, except for the percent of females (Table 3).

Block groups in cluster 1 and 3 have a higher percentage of Blacks and Hispanics. As for education, compared to block groups in cluster 1, block groups in cluster 2 and 3 have a high percentage of adults with higher educational attainment. In terms of household income, block groups in cluster 2 and 3 show a similar distribution of a lower percentage of low-income households and a high percentage of high-income households, while block groups in cluster 2 have a comparatively higher percentage of households with annual incomes greater than $100,000. Compared to block groups in cluster 2 and 3, block groups in cluster 1 have a higher percentage of zero-car households and households without internet access."
"142" "Significant disparities in all spatial variables (except micropolitan and noncore variables) are revealed among block groups in the three clusters. 20% of block groups in cluster 1 are in strong central areas, and 38% of block groups in cluster 1 are in medium metros. 22% of block groups in cluster 2 are in fringe areas of large metros. In periphery areas (micropolitan and noncore), the distribution of block groups in the three clusters is similar. Block groups in cluster 1 and 3 tend to have a higher population  density."

"336" "We estimated a multinomial logit model to examine how socio-demographic and spatial characteristics at the block group level are associated with cluster types (Table 4). We chose cluster 2 as the reference cluster because block groups in cluster 2 comparatively have higher medical visits, and block groups in cluster 2 exhibit a typical pattern of medical visits, decreasing significantly during the lockdown and recovering after. These socio-demographic variables are strongly correlated, and thus we presented our final model without any multicollinearity issues. The model overall has a moderate fit (Pseudo R 2 =0.10)."
"337" "A higher percentage of females is negatively correlated with the relative likelihood of being in cluster 1. A 1% increase in the female population is associated with a 0.5% lower probability of being in cluster 1 (Table 4 and Table 5).  A 10% increase in persons over age 65 has a positive and significant association with a 1.8% higher probability of being in cluster 1 ."
"338" "Race and income have the strongest effects. A 10% increase in Whites tends to have a 7.3% and 1.1% lower probability of being in cluster 1 and 3, respectively. A 10% increase in households with incomes less than $35,000, and a 10% decrease in higher than $100,000 are associated with a 2.8% and 2.3% higher probability of being in a temporal pattern like cluster 1. Block groups with a higher percentage of zero-vehicles are more likely to belong to cluster 2 than cluster 1."

Geographic proximity to health care facilities is positively associated with the probability of being in cluster 2, characterized as higher medical visits and a comparatively quick recovery."
"519" "Discussion"
"520" "Our study aimed to 1) analyze patterns of travel to medical facilities during 2020 and 2) assess the reliability of  SafeGraph  data for analyzing trips to medical facilities."
"521" "6.1  Disparate  p atterns of  v isits to  m edical  f acilities"
"522" "We found three distinct clusters of temporal patterns of visits to medical POI during 2020. All three clusters experienced a reduction in medical care visits during the lockdown but differed in their extent and recovery patterns."
"523" "It is interesting to note that block groups with lower medical visits before pandemic (cluster 1) experience a slower recovery. The socio-demographic and spatial characteristics at the block group level are significantly associated with the disparities of cluster 1 and 2, and the most significant results were observed for age, race, income, spatial locations, and population density. Block groups with higher percentages of elderly persons, minorities, low-income individuals, and people without vehicle access (cluster 1) had limited use of health care before and during the pandemic and experienced a slower recovery after the lockdown. These socio-demographic disparities confirm the necessity of health systems to care adequately for these groups under normal conditions and during a pandemic."
"524" "Block groups with higher population density and in central areas are more likely to be in cluster 1.  Higher population density areas and central areas are usually areas with higher public transit use ( Schimek , 1996), but public transit is also highly likely to be affected by the pandemic. As a result, people living in these areas are more likely to have difficulty in getting to health care during COVID-19 and experience a lower recovery after the lockdown. The positive association between a lower facility density and the likelihood of being cluster 1 also suggests the limited physical access to health care resources for block groups in cluster 1 , highlighting the importance of ensuring equal accessibility to health care resources ( Guida  &  Carpenteri , 2021)"
"525" "Block groups in the other two clusters with comparably higher medical visits (cluster 2 and cluster 3) mainly differ in recovery patterns of medical visits after April; cluster 3 has a relatively slower and modest recovery. The socio-demographic and spatial characteristic variables also explain the disparities in recovery patterns between cluster 2 and cluster 3. It is important to note that these significant associations tend to be small in magnitude, suggesting recovery patterns of medical care visits after the lockdown are not sensitive to socio-demographic and spatial characteristics. However, the effect sizes of two variables, percentages of White and highest income individuals are still comparable. Block groups with higher percentages of Whites and  people in the highest income class (greater than $100,000) reduced their medical visits during the lockdown but increased their visits soon after the lockdown."
"526" "6.2  Using mobile phone data to measure medical trips"
"527" "Our assessment of the  accuracy and reliability of mobile device data from  SafeGraph  to analyze visits to medical facilities shows that the data has a good geographic representativeness of population at different geographic scales (county, tract and block group). The data was spatially balanced when sampling health care facility POIs and could measure the overall temporal patterns of visits to medical facility POIs at the state level. However, the data still suffers from a slight under-representativeness of low-incomes and non-Whites. The data issues may indicate that  SafeGraph  data does not accurately record medical visits by low-income people ,  especially in rural areas.   The study's focus on longitudinal analysis and spatially balanced distribution of health care POI would help alleviate potential sampling bias."
"528" "Our assessment also showed a significant decrease in sampled devices, which may be attributed to the inability of mobile phone data to track a population staying at home not using phone apps with GPS tracking. However,  SafeGraph  data does not reveal the information about which phone apps with GPS tracking are recorded in the data collection process. Different socio-demographic groups may use their phone apps differently. Without data transparency about phone apps, it would be difficult for us to evaluate and correct the potential bias of the sampling."
"529" "6.3  Strengths and  l imitations"
"530" "Timely delivery and access to health care are essential under normal circumstances and during a pandemic. This study is among the few to examine medical care visits during COVID-19. Distinct from other studies, ours is based on a geographically extensive sample of mobile devices across the state of North Carolina, allowing for interpretation beyond the context of a single geographic setting and a small sample of patients."
"531" "Several caveats should be considered when interpreting the research results. The  data suffers from some under-representativeness issues revealed in our assessment. The data tracks a device instead of an individual, and thus it could not distinguish multiple people traveling with one sampled device. These data issues are still unclear, and this study does not differ from most studies using mobile device data. The data also cannot capture sub-Census block group heterogeneities without individual information. This study focuses on area-level associations rather than individual-level associations; however, area-level characteristics are significantly associated with health behavior independent of individual characteristics ( Turrell  et al., 2010), suggesting the value of considering area-level characteristics. "
"532" "While our focus on North Carolina was useful for understanding broader geographic disparities, especially urban and rural disparities, it could also mask variation within metropolitan areas which usually have more apparent disparities in the distribution of socio-demographic characteristics. It would be interesting to conduct similar research in a single metropolitan area as a supplement to this study’s findings."
"533" "Conclusion and Policy Implications"
"534" "Analysis of the temporal patterns of visits to medical POI across 2020 and their associations with socio-demographic and spatial characteristics at the block group level reveals two key findings. The findings may be useful for policymakers seeking to improve health care delivery and access."
"535" "Block groups with higher percentages of elderly persons, minorities, low-income individuals, and people without vehicle access (cluster 1) had  lower  use of health care  before the pandemic  and experienced a slower recovery in medical visits after the lockdown.  Health policymakers and transportation planners need to develop appropriate strategies to address persistent inequalities in health care use by these social groups. First, health policymakers need to make telemedicine a viable option for people living in these less advantageous block groups. Historically vulnerable populations, such as racial minorities, adults over 65, and low-income households, have limited digital literacy and access (Smith, 2020). Community health centers, which provide safety-net care for low-income and uninsured people, have financial constraints to implement telemedicine (Kim J-H et al., 2020). Health care providers need to develop training programs to teach populations in these areas the digital skills to use telemedicine and offer language interpreter access. Health care systems may also need to provide community health centers located in less advantageous areas with funding to support  telemedicine."
"536" "Second, public transportation agencies, private transportation providers, health care providers, and governments should work together to provide low-cost and reliable transportation options for people living in these less advantageous block groups. Transportation agencies should ensure that transit and paratransit options for health care are still operating for these block groups. People may also be less willing to use transit to conduct health care visits because of safety concerns. Thus, transportation and health care agencies may need to make efforts to partner with private transportation providers, like ride-hailing services (e.g., Uber), to provide low-cost ride-hailing options for vulnerable populations to access care."
"537" "Block groups in the central areas of large metropolitans or with higher population density tend to have a slow recovery of health care visits (cluster 1 and 3 vs. cluster 2).  The results may be attributed to significant disruptions in transportation in these areas. When transit services become unavailable in these dense and central areas, transportation agencies, health care providers, and private transportation provider companies should support alternate transportation options for people living in central and dense areas. Ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft have provided Non-Emergency Medical Transportation (NEMT) since 2018 and 2016. Studies (Power et al., 2018) have shown that using ridesharing NEMT has produced positive results, such as fewer missed appointments. Health care providers and insurers could continue partnerships with ride-hailing companies for people living in these areas to access health care. Transportation agencies could also collaborate with bike-share companies to provide free or low-cost bike-share in these areas. Bicycling may not be a good transportation option for all people who need care. However, the availability of bike-share programs could expand mode options and reduce the number of transit transfers for people who live in the central areas and rely on transit to access health care."
