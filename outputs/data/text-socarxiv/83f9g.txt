Abstract
Background: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused the worst international crisis since
World War II. Italy was one of the countries most affected by both the pandemic and the related
infodemic. The success of anti-COVID-19 strategies and future public health policies in Italy cannot
prescind from containment of fake news and divulgation of correct information.
Objective: The aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on conspiracy attitudes and
risk perception of Italian web users.
Methods: Google Trends was used to monitor users' web interest in specific topics, such as
conspiracy hypotheses, vaccine side effects, and pollution/climate change. The keywords adopted to
represent these topics were mined from Bufale.net – an Italian website specialized in detecting online
hoaxes – and Google Trends suggestions (i.e., related topics and related queries). Relative search
volumes of the timelapse 2016-2020 (pre-COVID-19) and 2020-2021 (post-COVID-19) were
compared through percentage difference (∆% ) and Welch’s t-test (𝑡). When data series were not
stationary, other ad-hoc criteria were used. The trend slopes were assessed through Sen's Slope (𝑆𝑆).
The significance thresholds have been indicatively set at 𝑃 = .05 and 𝑡 = 1.9.
Results: The COVID-19 pandemic drastically enforced Italian netizens' conspiracy attitudes (𝛥% ∈
[60, 288], 𝑡 ∈ [6, 12]). The regional web interest towards conspiracy-related queries has increased
̅̅̅̅̅̅ = 80 ± 2.8, 𝑡𝑚𝑖𝑛 =
and become more homogeneous compared to the pre-COVID-19 period (𝑅𝑆𝑉
1.8, 𝛥𝑚𝑖𝑛% = +12.4, 𝑚𝑖𝑛 ∆𝑆𝐷% = −25.8). Besides, a growing trend in web interest in the infodemic
YouTube channel "ByoBlu" has been highlighted. The web interest in fake news has increased more
than that in anti-hoax services (𝑡1 = 11.3 𝑣𝑠 𝑡2 = 4.5, 𝛥1 = +157.6 𝑣𝑠 𝛥2 = +84.7).
Equivalently, the web interest in vaccine side effects exceeded that in pollution/climate change
(𝑆𝑆𝑣𝑎𝑐 = 0.22, 𝑃 < .001 𝑣𝑠 𝑆𝑆𝑝𝑜𝑙 = 0.05, 𝑃 < .001, ∆% = +296.4).
Conclusions: COVID-19 has given a significant boost to online conspiracy attitudes in Italy. In
particular, the average web interest in conspiracy hypotheses has increased and become more uniform
across regions. The pandemic accelerated an already growing trend in users' interest towards some
fake news sources, including the 500,000 subscribers YouTube channel "ByoBlu" (canceled for
disinformation in March 2021). The risk perception related to COVID-19 vaccines has been so
distorted that vaccine side effects-related queries outweighed those relating to pollution and climate
change, which are much more urgent issues. Based on these findings, it is necessary that the Italian
authorities implement more effective infoveillance systems and communication by the mass media is
less sensationalistic and more consistent with the available scientific evidence. In this context, Google
Trends can be used to monitor the users' response to specific infodemiological countermeasures.
Further research is needed to understand the psychological mechanisms that regulate risk perception.
Keywords: COVID-19, fake news, Google Trends, infodemiology, Italy, risk perception

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (abbreviated in COVID-19) was responsible for one of the dramatic
global crises after World War II. To date (April 24, 2021), the official global toll is 144 million cases
and 3.1 million deaths [1]. Such a pandemic has also triggered a vast infodemic capable of seriously
damaging the economy and sanitary system of many countries, as well as favoring the spread of the
novel coronavirus itself [2]. Specifically, an infodemic is defined as an excessive amount of unfiltered
information concerning a problem such that the solution is made more difficult [3]. As reported by
the World Health Organization (WHO), this phenomenon can intensify or lengthen outbreaks. For
this reason, a huge infoveillance effort has been made to study the information circulating on the web
and contain the spread of fake news [4]. In this context, 132 nations worldwide signed a document to
guarantee their commitment to the battle against disinformation and misinformation [5]. On the
operational level, infodemic management takes place through 4 key points: i) listening to community
concerns and questions, ii) promoting understanding of risk and health expert advice, iii) building
resilience to misinformation, iv) engaging and empowering communities to take positive action [2].
This paper focuses on points ii) and iii) as concerns Italy, one of the nations most affected by COVID19 [1]. In particular, this study aims to analyze and quantify the impact of COVID-19 on Italian
netizens' risk perception and conspiracy attitudes through Google Trends, an infoveillance tool
provided by GoogleTM that returns users' web interest in specific topics in the form of normalized
values called "relative search volumes" (RSVs) [6]. Google Trends has been exploited extensively in
the scientific community to conduct infodemiological, medical, psychological, economic, and even
epidemiological studies [7-12]. Indeed, although the media can influence users' web searches [13],
Google Trends provides valuable details on the dynamics of users' online interests (including the
influence of the media on collective thinking) [14, 15].
At present, the success of the vaccination campaign is crucial in the fight against COVID-19 [16, 17].
Conspiracy hypotheses, inadequate risk perception, and unjustified fears have already undermined
non-pharmacological containment measures and can reduce the effectiveness of pharmacological
ones [18]. Furthermore, these factors can compromise the management of equally serious problems
such as pollution and climate change (often linked to COVID-19 incidence and mortality) [19-21].
Therefore, such a scenario requires careful surveillance of the online information flow as well as
thoughtful communication. As we will show in this research, Google Trends can help achieve this
goal.

Methods
Data collection
For each topic appropriate keywords were selected as explained in the following subsections. Each
keyword was searched on Google Trends under the category "all categories". The timelapse was set
at five years (April 21, 2016 – April 21, 2021). Only the most relevant queries were included in the
̅̅̅̅̅̅ > 1). All keywords were collected for at least 7 consecutive days in order to
results (i.e. 𝑅𝑆𝑉
highlight potential anomalies and significant variations [22].
- Pre-existing fake news
Pre-existing fake news and disinformation channels were mined from the specialized anti-hoaxes
website "Bufale.net" [23]. Four keywords that can represent the main conspiracy-related web
interests on Google Trends were identified: "cospirazione + nuovo ordine mondiale + complotto"
(conspiracy + new world order + plot), "byoblu" (a 500,000 subscribers YouTube channel canceled
in March 2021 for disinformation), "Maurizio Blondet" (an Italian journalist who supports conspiracy
hypotheses), and "luogocomune" (a Facebook page sharing conspiracy hypotheses).
- Risk perception
RSVs of the query "fake news + bufale + notizie false" (fake news + hoaxes + false news) and the
previous queries (Pre-existing fake news) were compared. By doing so, it was possible to observe the
impact of the pandemic on web interest in anti-hoax services and hoaxes themselves. The selection
of the queries with the highest RSVs was conducted by consulting related topics and related queries
provided by Google Trends. The same procedure was carried out for the queries "vaccini effetti
collaterali + vaccino effetti collaterali" (vaccine side effects + vaccine side effects) and "inquinamento
+ cambiamento climatico" (pollution + climate change) queries. In this way, it was possible to
evaluate the web interest in two very distant topics in terms of health risk and incidence [24-26].
Statistical Analysis
- Welch’s t-test
Welch's t-test was used independently of the dataset distribution thanks to the central limit theorem
(𝑁 > 30, with 𝑁 number of measures). The difference between the two mean values was considered
significant indicatively when 𝑡 > 1.9.
- Percentage change
The percentage change ∆% was calculated through the formula [𝑦(𝑇2 ) − 𝑥(𝑇1 )]/𝑥(𝑇1 ) ∙ 100, where
𝑇𝑖 is a specific timelapse.
- Mean values
All mean values were calculated using the standard arithmetic mean and presented through the
notation 𝐴𝑉 ± 𝑆𝐸𝑀, where 𝑆𝐸𝑀 represents the standard error of the mean. When 𝑁 < 30, the
Shapiro-Wilk test was performed to assess the goodness of the mean value as a statistical measure.

4

- Data series analysis
All data series were graphed. To signal the presence/absence of trends, augmented Dickey-Fuller
(ADF) and Mann-Kendall + Sen's Slope (MK + SS) tests were adopted. The same tests were used to
evaluate datasets stationarity. Calculations were performed with Microsoft Excel 2021 software
through the Real-Statistics 2021 package (Supplementary File 1). The optimal lag was determined
using the Schwert criterion.
- Data series comparison
To provide a quantitative estimate of the effect of COVID-19 on web queries, RSV trends over the
last five years (21 April 2016 – 21 April 2021) were analyzed. As shown in a previous paper, Italian
netizens showed a marked interest in the COVID-19 pandemic only when this became a direct
national problem [27]. Therefore, the timelapse "21 April 2016 - 16 February 2020" (period 1) and
"16 February 2020 - 21 April 2021" (period 2) were compared. When period 1 turned out to be
stationary or contained a negative trend, 𝑡 and 𝛥% have been calculated. When period 1 contained a
stationary positive trend, the trend slopes of period 1 and a specific subperiod "16 February 2020 - x"
of period 2 were compared by 𝛥% ; such a subperiod was selected by observing the region of the graph
in which a possible positive level-shift occurred. Period 1 data were then linearly, quadratically, or
sigmoidally interpolated, depending on which monotone function minimized the statistical errors.
Period 2 data were interpolated through a polynomial function of 9th degree. Finally, 𝛥% was
calculated between the areas subtended by the two curves after February 16, 2020 (∆𝐴% ). These were
calculated using a definite integral between weeks 201 and 264. When period 1 contained a positive
level-shift but was piecewise quasi-stationary, 𝑡 and ∆% were calculated considering only the last
quasi-stationary subperiod.
- P-values
P-values were used as graded measures of evidence against the null hypothesis. An indicative
threshold has been set at 𝑃 = .05; however, exact P-values for ADF and MK+SS were reported in
Supplementary File 1.

Results
Web interest in pre-existing fake news
The impact of COVID-19 on conspiracy-related queries RSVs was evident (Figure 1): in particular,
∆1% = +102.5, 𝑡1 = 6.3; ∆2% = +288.2, 𝑡2 = 11.5; 𝛥𝛢3% = +10.2; 𝛥4% = +60.6, 𝑡4 = 6.2.

Figure 1. Conspiracy-related web relative search volumes (RSV) from April 21, 2016, to April 21, 2021 (Italy). Y-axis =
RSV.

It is relevant that COVID-19 national outbreak has influenced the RSV trend even after the end of
the first lockdown (May 2020). Indeed, Figure 1 shows a permanent level shift for all the investigated
web queries.
Regional interest in conspiracy-related keyword 1 decreased on average during 2016-2020 timelapse,
from 71 ± 4.2 to 52 ± 4.1 (Table 1). From 2020 to 2021, the increase in RSV was manifest and
̅̅̅̅̅̅ = 80 ± 2.8, 𝑡𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 1.8, 𝛥𝑚𝑖𝑛% = +12.4; 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 5.7, 𝛥𝑚𝑎𝑥% =
common to all regions (𝑅𝑆𝑉
+54.6). Over the period 2016-2020, the percentage standard deviation varied in the range
[22.1, 32.6], while it reached an absolute minimum of 14.4 during the COVID-19 pandemic. This
fact shows that web interest in conspiracies has also become more homogeneous across regions. No
correlation was sought as data was subject to a strong dependence on the day of collection [25];
however, the mean values and standard deviations never changed significantly (𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 0.4).

On the contrary, the web interest in the ByoBlu disinformation channel has always been compatible
during
2016-2021
(𝑡 ∈ [−1.3, 1.1], 𝛥% ∈ [−16.3, +21.8], 𝑡20−21 = −0.1, 𝛥20−21 = −1.0,
Supplementary File 1). Since Figure 1 witnesses a substantial increase in national searches, it is
evident that the query "byoblu" was searched more in some regions than others. By analyzing the
regional trends one by one, it can be observed that the "byoblu" web interest has increased over time
except for Basilicata and Molise (Figure 2). Although a growing trend was already present, the novel
coronavirus seems to have strongly impacted RSVs in Campania (𝛥20−21% = +93.3 𝑣𝑠 𝛥19−20% =
+63.8), Friuli-Venezia Giulia (𝛥20−21% = +187.6 𝑣𝑠 𝛥19−20% = +59.0), Lazio (𝛥20−21% =
+95.7 𝑣𝑠 𝛥19−20% = +15.8), Trentino-Alto Adige (𝛥20−21% = +173.2 𝑣𝑠 𝛥19−20% = +4.5),
and Valle d’Aosta (𝛥20−21% = +199.2 𝑣𝑠 𝛥19−20% = +86.2).

relative search volume.

Risk perception
A part of the users seemed aware of the high number of fake news on COVID-19 circulating on the
web and tried to limit its effects by relying on anti-hoax websites (Figure 3, next page). Nevertheless,
the impact of COVID-19 was more incisive for conspiracy hypotheses (𝑡1 = 11.3 𝑣𝑠 𝑡2 = 4.5,
𝛥1 = +157.6 𝑣𝑠 𝛥2 = +84.7), so much so that it is possible to observe a greater level-shift in the
trend of infodemic web queries. This worsening was homogeneous on a national scale (Figure 4).

2016-2020 and 2020-2021. The index shows the percentage of infodemic queries (e.g. 70 means 70% conspiracy-related
queries vs 30% anti-hoax-related queries).

With the announcement of the discovery of COVID-19 vaccines, web interest in side effects
immediately soared (𝑡 = 10.3, ∆% = +905.2 from October 2020 to April 2021). Although health
authorities report rare side effects of adenoviral vector vaccines only, web interest in this topic has
exceeded that in pollution and climate change (𝑆𝑆𝑣𝑎𝑐 = 1.2, 𝑃𝑀𝐾 < .001 𝑣𝑠 𝑆𝑆𝑝𝑜𝑙 = 0.81, 𝑃𝑀𝐾 <
.001, ∆% = +44.0, Figure 4), which are much more urgent issues. Pollution and climate change
effects-related query returned negligible RSVs.

When considering vaccines names-related queries, the gap between the RSVs further widens
(𝑆𝑆𝑣𝑎𝑐 = 0.22, 𝑃𝑀𝐾 < .001 𝑣𝑠 𝑆𝑆𝑝𝑜𝑙 = 0.05, 𝑃𝑀𝐾 < .001, ∆% = +296.4). As observable in
Figure 6, the risk perception in vaccines has surpassed that in pollution and climate change in a
homogeneous way throughout Italy (Figure 6, next page).

Discussion
Principal Findings
To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the impact of COVID-19
on pre-existing fake news and the risk perception of Italian web users. These findings show that the
pandemic - understood as a set of different situations such as health crisis, economic crisis, lockdown,
disease, infodemic - has significantly increased the phenomenon of conspiracy and interest in it. This
influence caused not only a marked initial growth of relative search volume (RSV) during the first
lockdown (March-May 2020) but also generated a pronounced level-shift in web interest that has
persisted until nowadays. The regional web interest in the conspiracy hypotheses in the pre-COVID19 2016-2020 period had assumed a clear negative trend and was more noticeable in some areas than
in others. However, with the advent of the novel coronavirus, interest has increased to reach the
highest value in the last five years, becoming even more homogeneous across regions. Due to the
high dependence of the RSV on the day of gathering, it was not possible to search for correlations
with the regional number of COVID-19 cases; nevertheless, the mean values and the variance of the
sample have always remained similar. On the contrary, analyzing the data year by year, no change in
the average interest in the infodemic YouTube channel "ByoBlu" (which had over 500,000
subscribers) was observed between the regions. Since a strong increase was highlighted nationwide,
some regions must have contributed far more than others to the jump in total RSV. Specifically, as
shown in Figure 2, Campania, Lazio, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige, and Valle d'Aosta
experienced a much higher increase than the other regions. Moreover, a growing trend in RSV during
the last five years characterized all regions except Basilicata and Molise. Finally, web interest in fake
news sources has increased more than that in anti-hoax services. These results are not to be
underestimated: indeed, the Ministry of Health, various online platforms such as YouTube and
Twitter, and social networks such as Facebook and Instagram have declared war without borders
against the rampant infodemic. Specifically, under each video relating to the pandemic, YouTube has
affixed a warning bar that offers users the opportunity to read the latest COVID-19 news on the
Ministry of Health official website (complete with a button to access it). A similar procedure has been
adopted by Facebook and Instagram (Figure 7, next page). All these companies have banned accounts
and channels protagonists of the fake news spread, including ByoBlu [28-32]. This approach is
partially consistent with the procedure proposed by the WHO to deal with the infodemic but was not
sufficient to avoid a boost in disinformation in Italy. Among the problems that have undermined the
effectiveness of these strategies, there is the resonance given by newspapers and television channels
to unreliable or misleading information [33-36]. Beyond the mere disinformation contribution, this
can foster distrust towards mass media, making the information campaign even more complex during
times of crisis [37]. Furthermore, despite all the countermeasures adopted, social networks and
messaging applications such as WhatsApp are a constant vehicle of fake news [33, 34, 37].

Figure 7. YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram COVID-19 informative bars (Italian language).

Alongside this, the influence of newspapers and television news on the risk perception on antiCOVID-19 vaccines was evident. Although the trend has been on the rise since early October 2020,
the headlines of online, printed, and television news publications have often been the subject of
criticism from the scientific community as sensationalistic and far from scientific evidence [38-40].
Distrust of vaccines is a growing problem that raises a serious question of public health [41-43].
Although most vaccines-related fake news circulates on social networks, the national mass media
must attend to the evidence presented in the scientific literature with appropriate and thoughtful
language. In particular, the effect of deliberately misleading titles linked to secondary aspects of the
article can have serious consequences [44]. In such an intricate scenario, the web interest in vaccine
side effects has overtaken that in pollution and climate change. Notwithstanding that the author of
this paper loudly supports the pharmacovigilance process and is aware of the existence of numerous
studies on the possible causal link between adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccines and thrombotic
events [45-47], it is necessary to consider that pollution and climate change constitute today one of
the major global threats, claiming millions of victims every year [25, 48]. Since Janssen and
Vaxzevria vaccines have very rare side effects [26, 48-51], it is reasonable to conclude that the risk
perception of Italian users is distorted and disconnected from the real dangers that menace it. This is
even more true when considering the incidence of COVID-19 itself in this type of event [52, 53].
Limitations
There are no guarantees that Google Trends is sufficient to investigate the totality of the interests of
the Italian public. Furthermore, it is not certain that the keywords used in this research include all the
terms related to the topics investigated.
Conclusions
COVID-19 has given a significant boost to online conspiracy attitudes in Italy. In particular, the
average web interest in conspiracy hypotheses has increased and become more uniform across
13

regions. The pandemic accelerated an already growing trend in users' interest towards some fake news
sources, including the 500,000 subscribers YouTube channel "ByoBlu" (canceled for disinformation
in March 2021). The risk perception related to COVID-19 vaccines has been so distorted that vaccine
side effects-related queries outweighed those relating to pollution and climate change, which are
much more urgent issues. Based on these findings, it is necessary that the Italian authorities
implement more effective infoveillance systems and communication by the mass media is less
sensationalistic and more consistent with the available scientific evidence. In this context, Google
Trends can be used to monitor the users' response to specific infodemiological countermeasures.
Further research is needed to understand the psychological mechanisms that regulate risk perception.
