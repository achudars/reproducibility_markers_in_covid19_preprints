Pandemic Leadership: Did “Scientists” Lock Down More Quickly?
Joachim Wehner* and Mark Hallerberg^†
April 2021
Commentators have suggested a link between leaders having a “science” background and the
speed of lockdown after the outbreak of COVID-19. We examine possible underlying
mechanisms and test this relationship empirically with a global dataset of the educational
background of 188 leaders in office at the start of the pandemic. Using several statistical tests,
we find no support for a systematic relationship between a leader having studied a natural
science or medicine and the timing of the first lockdown. There are no systematic effects for
female leaders and populists either. We caution against generalizations based on a small
number of high-profile anecdotes about how certain leadership traits translate into different
policy responses during the pandemic.
Did leaders with natural science or medical backgrounds lock down more quickly following the
outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic? The effectiveness of governments in fighting the disease
has been under intense public and media scrutiny. As infection and mortality data began to
show distinct patterns, commentators quickly pointed to the quality of leadership (e.g., Al Saidi
et al. 2020, Gallu and Delfs 2020). Media coverage highlighted the divergent capacity of leaders
to grasp relevant concepts and scientific evidence, and to act on it. US President Donald Trump,
a real estate developer with an economics degree, resisted a national lockdown. Instead, he
mused about treating COVID-19 with “very powerful light” and injecting disinfectant (Rucker et
al. 2020). In contrast, German Chancellor Angela Merkel declared the pandemic her country’s
greatest challenge since World War II, urged citizens to avoid unnecessary contact, and
explained the epidemiological basis of her strategy with “the calm confidence expected of a
former research scientist with a doctorate in quantum chemistry” (Oltermann 2020). That
Merkel was a “scientist” was touted as “the secret to Germany’s Covid-19 success” as she
emerged as “the political leader who executed, celebrated, and personified evidence-based
thinking when it mattered most” (Miller 2020). It is easy to find anecdotes such as these to
suggest a “science” education mattered. Why might there be a link? And what do the data say?
Why education might matter
There are at least two reasons why we might expect a link between a government’s response to
the pandemic and the academic training of its leader. The first stems from the fact that crisis
situations require speedy decisions, taken by a small group of high-level politicians without the
luxury of lengthy analysis. In such contexts, the capability of a leader immediately to grasp the

problem may be crucial. Prior research shows that the characteristics of leaders shape the
performance of organizations and countries (Besley et al. 2011, Dube and Harish 2020,
Malmendier et al. 2011). In complex emergencies that require immediate decisions, there is a
twist to this argument. This relates to the fit between a leader’s specific expertise and the
nature of the crisis – in a banking crisis, an understanding of the financial system may help
(Hallerberg and Wehner 2020); in a public health crisis, expertise in medicine or the natural
sciences may be key (Rachman 2020).
The second reason why the nature of a leader’s educational background may matter is that
individuals select into particular academic subjects, which has been linked to their personality
types (Gambetta and Hertog 2016). In our context, this implies that some leaders intuitively
take data and evidence seriously, others not, and this leads them to pursue different
educational choices. While it is difficult to distinguish this channel from the first one, their
empirical implications point in the same direction: Leaders who studied a relevant academic
subject – a natural science or medicine – are more likely to understand the pandemic, take
evidence seriously, and hence, act quickly in response.
One counterargument is that leaders may not require specific expertise when they can rely on
highly trained advisors to help them make the right decisions. However, leaders choose their
advisors, and their closest confidants are often cut from the same cloth. For example, Angela
Merkel’s chief of staff is a medical doctor, Helge Braun. Boris Johnson’s chief advisor during
most of 2020 was Dominic Cummings, who was privately educated and studied humanities at
Oxford – just like the prime minister. Such advisors, if anything, reflect and reinforce the skill
set of their respective leader.
Also uncertain is the influence on leaders of health ministers or other experts. During April and
May 2020, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who opposed strict pandemic control measures,
fired two medically trained health ministers he disagreed with before appointing an army
general to the portfolio (Schipani 2020). Alternatively, leaders can simply ignore experts when
their advice does not suit them, as did US President Donald Trump with his top infectious
diseases expert, Anthony Fauci (Viglione 2020). Whether experts can compensate for
shortcomings in the analytic capacity of politicians during crisis situations is thus far from
certain, and likely contingent on how open these politicians are to receiving such advice in the
first place. This again leads us back to the personal characteristics of political leaders.
Few leaders are “scientists”
Moving this discussion beyond anecdotes requires systematic data on the personal traits of
political leaders, specifically their educational background. We set out to collect official and
other biographical information for the leaders of all 193 United Nations member states who
were in office at the start of 2020. In Guatemala and Austria, elections had taken place in the
previous year and a new president (Alejandro Giammattei) and chancellor (Sebastian Kurz) took
office in January 2020, so we code these as in office at the start of that year. We could not
2

identify a single individual as effective leader in some politically unstable countries (Libya,
Yemen, Sudan and Haiti) and in one diarchy (San Marino).
To classify the educational background of leaders, we used the International Standard
Classification of Education (ISCED) developed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (1997). This yields some information of overall levels of educational
attainment, with the caveat that the equivalence of levels of education across countries is at
times difficult to assess. Of 188 leaders in our dataset, 87% (164) had a university degree,
defined as ISCED level 5 or 6. Of those with a degree, we estimate that about half had an
advanced degree (ISCED level 6), including 34 leaders (18%) with a doctorate or PhD.
We categorized degree subjects following ISCED 1997 (Andersson and Olsson 1999). Where a
leader studied more than one subject, we coded all of them. In most cases, we could classify
subjects in a straightforward way, but there were exceptions. For example, Australia’s Prime
Minister Scott Morrison has a degree in economic geography, which may be considered a
subfield of geography or of economics – in this case, we classified it as the latter. For three
countries (Marshall Islands, Palau, and Tuvalu), we could confirm that the leader had completed
a degree, but not the subjects studied. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the degree subjects of
all other 185 world leaders in our dataset across ISCED “broad fields”. By far the most popular
category is “social sciences, business, and law”, followed by “humanities and arts”. The
“services” category ranges from “hair and beauty services” to “military and defense”, which is
not very informative. To add precision, Figure 2 identifies the six most popular “detailed fields”,
to which we add the less popular life and physical sciences.
It is striking that, even with our generous definition of having studied a subject, there are very
few world leaders with a university degree in medicine or the life or physical sciences. The 15
leaders (8% of the total) listed in Table 1 studied at least one relevant subject and we classify
them as “scientists” for the purpose of our analysis. Most studied medicine. They rule in
industrialized and developing countries, democracies and dictatorships, and they are
geographically dispersed across four continents (Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America). At
first glance, these leaders appear to represent a variety of pandemic responses. Apart from
Angela Merkel, the only other leader who studied a natural science and completed a doctorate
in chemistry is President John Magufuli of Tanzania, who denied the existence of COVID-19 –
and later died, officially of “heart complications” and amidst rumors he had caught the virus
(Economist 2021). Among medical doctors, the Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was praised for his
hands-on involvement in the early stages of the pandemic (Landler 2020), while the Turkmen
President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow declared his country free of COVID-19 and
recommended licorice as a cure (AFP 2020).
What do the data say?
The key outcome of interest is the speed of lockdown. Facing extreme uncertainty about the
disease and how best to fight it (Gibney 2020), how quickly governments adopted containment
3

and closure policies had direct consequences for subsequent mortality rates. By one estimate,
the UK government could have saved 20,000 lives by locking down just one week earlier
(Stewart and Sample 2020). However, not all central governments have the constitutional
authority to impose a lockdown, notably in federal countries (Olson 2020). To acknowledge
these differences, we operationalize lockdowns in two alternative ways.
Our first measure of lockdown is the number of days from the start of 2020 to the initial
nationwide “stay at home” recommendation or order. All national leaders could have issued
the former, irrespective of their constitutional authority. Whether and when to do so was an
essential decision they faced at the start of the pandemic. We extract this information from the
Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker dataset (Hale et al. 2021). This covers 169
countries in our dataset, with 151 of them adopting such a measure in 2020. The dataset
indicates Monaco was the first to do so, after 24 days. The median number of days was 83, but
the distribution of this variable has a longer tail as reflected in a mean of 95 days.
Our second measure of lockdown is based on a broader “stringency index” that also captures
other containment and closure policies, such as school closures, restrictions on internal
movement, or international travel controls (Hale et al. 2021). The index is additive and thus
allows for substitutability between different policy measures. It also counts measures targeted
at – or adopted by – specific subnational authorities, giving them a lower weight than those
with nationwide applicability when calculating the overall score. We construct an indicator of
the day on which countries reach the median stringency index score of 54.63, which 160 out of
169 countries did during 2020. On this measure, China was the first to adopt a “stringent”
policy response after 26 days. The median number of days was 78, with a mean of 82.
An examination of the number of days since the first of January is a rather blunt measure. One
could think of others, such as the date of lockdown after the first case in a country’s borders, or
after a given threshold of cases. These alternatives have problems of their own. Early in the
pandemic, the testing regimes varied widely, and even to this day some countries do no testing.
Even more problematic, the level and quality of testing is likely correlated with other variables
we care about, such as the overall quality of the health system. We do include as a control the
date of the first reported death in a given country in one regression model. The fact that
someone is reported as dying from the virus may put pressure on the government to act. But
we cannot say with any precision the date when the first actual death occurred.
In terms of explanations, leaders differ on many other dimensions, not only their educational
background, and we code some of these attributes as well. Commentators have also related
COVID-19 deaths to whether governments were led by women (Garikipati and Kambhampati
2020, Maclean 2020, North 2020) or populists (Rachman 2020). These characteristics overlap:
Angela Merkel is a woman with a doctorate in chemistry, and anything but a populist; Jair
Bolsonaro has a military background, is a man, and is a populist. We thus need to consider
these traits jointly. Hence, we coded whether a national leader in January 2020 was a man or a
woman, and identified “populists” based on the list by Kyle and Meyer (2020). Of the 169

4

leaders of countries for which we have COVID-19 response data, 13 had a natural science or
medical education, 13 were women, and 17 were populists.
Figure 3 reports Kaplan-Meier survivor functions that relate these leader traits to the
probability of a nationwide stay at home measure. Most governments did so during the 2020
calendar year, and it mattered little whether they were led by a scientist, woman, or populist.
Log-rank tests for the equality of the survivor functions indicate no significant differences.
Figure 4 looks at those 151 governments that took this step and when they did so. The median
date is March 21 for governments led by scientists, and it falls in between March 17 and 18 for
both women and populists (against March 23 for all three: non-scientists, men, and nonpopulists). Only the difference in medians for populists and non-populists is borderline
statistically significant with a Wilcoxon rank-sum test (z = 1.865, p = .062).
We replicate this analysis with our alternative outcome measure. Again, log-rank tests for the
equality of survivor functions in Figure 5 do not detect any significant differences. Looking at
the 160 countries in which the government adopted a “stringent” policy response, the median
date falls between March 19 and 20 for scientists (March 19 for non-scientists), between March
17 and 18 for women (March 20 for men), and March 16 for populists (March 20 for nonpopulists). Here, we reject the hypothesis of equal medians for populists and non-populists with
a Wilcoxon rank-sum test (z = 3.470, p < .001).
So far, we have no evidence that leaders with a “science” education are linked to differences in
the speed of lockdown. Yet, whether a government has a certain type of leader may covary
with other variables that also affect the outcome we examine. We thus assessed these
relationships in a Cox regression framework, using a dataset structured by country-day and
covering the entire 2020 calendar year. To account for resources, we control for the natural log
of GDP per capita (in constant 2010 US$; World Bank 2020) and purported capacity to handle
an infectious disease outbreak according to the 2019 Global Health Security Index (Nuclear
Threat Initiative et al. 2019; but see Aitken et al. 2020). We further include a measure of liberal
democracy from the V-Dem dataset (Coppedge et al. 2020, Pemstein et al. 2020). While
dictators are unincumbered by the checks and balances of democratic constitutions and can act
more swiftly, democracies have an advantage due to the free flow of information that
promotes responsive government (Besley and Dray 2020, Kavanagh 2020).
Finally, we attempt to control for country-specific dynamics of the pandemic in two ways. First,
we account for whether a government has officially confirmed any COVID-19 deaths or not, as
recorded in the Oxford dataset (Hale et al. 2021). Our expectation is that doing so would speed
up the policy response. We use a simple binary indicator as there is little consistency in fatality
data, and misinformation is rife (Besley and Dray 2020). As noted above, this is also the reason
why the period we examine is the 2020 calendar year, rather than choosing a starting point
with reference to recorded cases or deaths. Second, we include an indicator for island
countries, which could stop international travelers importing the disease more easily than
countries with land borders.

5

The resulting Hazard ratios reported in Tables 2 and 3 lend no support to the hypothesis that
leaders with a natural science or medical background were any quicker in locking down. We
find no significant effects for female leaders and populists either. This pattern is stable across
the different specifications and not substantively affected by variations in control variables,
irrespective of the outcome measure that we use.
Implications
There is a perception based on anecdotal evidence that leaders who are “experts” in a natural
science or medicine understood the pandemic better than their counterparts and enforced
earlier lockdowns – which were important because they saved lives. We do not find such a
relationship using a worldwide dataset.
One possible explanation for these results is that our data are too inexact, or too plagued with
measurement error, to find any meaningful relations. Yet we do find a statistically meaningful
and plausible relationship with two independent variables, namely that lockdowns came more
quickly after a first reported death and that island nations were less likely to lock down.
A second would be that we are dealing with observational data that might be riddled with
endogeneity problems. Countries differ in various respects that may be correlated with the
traits of their leaders and their policy response, giving rise to omitted variable bias. Yet our
findings are consistent even in a regression framework with controls, which provides some
reassurance. Moreover, some features of our dataset rule out other potential sources of bias.
As the leaders themselves were appointed prior to the pandemic, reciprocal causation is not a
concern. And we counter sample selection bias, which motivated our analysis, by achieving 90%
coverage of the eligible population (169 out of 188 UN members with identifiable leaders).
A third would be that the dependent variable itself, namely the lockdown date, is a very
incomplete measure of what governments did to fight the pandemic. “Scientists” may pay more
attention to the details of the bigger steps. The Hale et al. (2021) dataset includes other
dimensions of the policy response to the crisis, such as contact tracing and tests. Yet we looked
at the broader “stringency” index in the Hale et al. (2021) dataset to consider the speed of a
“stringent” policy response and similarly found null results. We prefer to look specifically at
nationwide stay at home recommendations, given that key information can be obscured in an
additive index as combinations of different variables may lead to the same index value. But
again, the null results remain even with the more broadly-based alternative measure.
Rather, we think our results provide a cautionary tale concerning generalizations about how
certain leadership traits translate into different policy responses during the pandemic. A
woman with a doctorate in a natural science may initiate an early lockdown, as was the case in
Germany. But there does not appear to be a systematic relationship between these traits and
the date of lockdown.
