Abstract
This study aims to determine the level of ESP students’ satisfaction with online ESP learning courses at
three faculties of Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. The current study examines students’
answers to identify their satisfaction in ESP online courses. The study's research questions were divided
into four categories: the effectiveness of online ESP learning, the availability of learning material used by
ESP instructors, the evaluation of ESP teachers' results, the effectiveness of online testing, and students'
difficulties with ESP distance learning. A descriptive statistical method was used to validate the study.
The statistics package JASP was used for data analysis. The authors chose observation, literature analysis,
a questionnaire provision, and descriptive data analysis as the research tools. The study results show that
students are primarily pleased with ESP courses taught online, students fulfil the expected progress in
ESP learning performance. It is revealed that the main problems that influence and impact online ESP
learning during COVID-19 are related to technical, academic, and communication challenges. Student
satisfaction surveys may lead to changes in ESP online learning activities that may, in turn, boost
students’ outcomes. The results provide valuable insight into students' satisfaction with online learning
and pose practical questions for its implementation. As a result, this study is just a preliminary attempt at
offering considerate analysis to Ukraine's policymakers.

Introduction
To prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, most higher education institutions
worldwide abruptly stopped in-class study at the end of March 2020 (UNESCO, 2020b). As a
result of these closures, universities have been forced to use online training tools irrespective
students’ and teachers’ competencies in using technological resources (World Bank, 2020).
Although online education is not a new pedagogical methodology and has been used in different
fields for many years, there is still a lack of competence in integrating online learning platforms
in higher education institutions (UNESCO, 2016). The worldwide academic calendar was
plunged into a state of disarray by the coronavirus pandemic. Many teachers and students have
gone home and self-quarantined at the same time (UNESCO, 2020a). As a solution to this
problem, several academic leaders are now supporting online education. (UNESCO, 2020). It is
necessary to acknowledge the fact that online education is not a satisfactory substitute for faceto-face delivery. In Ukraine students of the higher education institutions were asked to stay home
and continue their studies online. All lectures and seminars were transferred entirely to online
learning at Taras Shevchenko National University.
With the ongoing technology development in distance learning and with the introduction
of digital teaching technologies, it is crucial to analyse the level of students’ satisfaction in online
learning. These issues are of great concern to teachers and administrators of the vast majority of
universities worldwide, as students are recognized as the most critical stakeholders in higher
education. All efforts are made to meet their educational needs and to ensure the quality of
teaching and learning. Evidence of this is the statistical research conducted in the UK and the
USA. They, in particular, show that the percentage of students' dissatisfaction with the
educational process is growing rapidly. It is indicated in a survey by the British Office for
National Statistics. In a January survey by the UK's National Statistics Office (ONS), 37% of
students said they were "dissatisfied" or "very dissatisfied" with higher education. It is 8% more
than in November last year. The biggest problems, according to British students, are the teaching
methods, teaching materials, and the quality of knowledge. In the UK, it can be explained by the
transition of most subjects to the online environment through the third lockdown, which was
introduced in early January (Office for National Statistics, 2021).
In Ukraine, as in most countries across the world, studies on students’ perception of
online learning are also being conducted. The State Quality Service of Education of Ukraine
conducted an online survey among teachers and students to analyze their satisfaction with online
education and assess the quality of online learning in the 2020/2021 academic year. The survey
found various critical challenges in online learning that are considered to influence the quality
and efficient study. Such challenges include lack of transparency in the students’ assessment,
lack of or poor internet connection, insufficient control over students' acquisition of knowledge,
a lot of individual learning, and lack of professional competence for teaching online (The State
Quality Service of Education of Ukraine, 2020).
The network of Higher Education Reform Experts reports on the Ukrainian situation with
online learning at higher education institutions. According to the findings, Ukrainian universities
help their students meet their educational targets in these unprecedented times. The flexibility
with which online learning is adopted across Ukraine, however, differs significantly. The higher
education institutions experienced with Erasmus+ projects have successfully used the projects’

findings on the creative teaching, learning approaches and instruments of online learning.
However, most Ukrainian universities are facing similar problems: 1) there is a shortage of
institutional policies and tools to coordinate online learning, 2) the introduction of high-quality
multimedia facilities and content is still recent and there is a need to manage the multitude of
such services, and 3) teaching personnel have limited knowledge and competence and/or a lack
of digital skills (HERE, 2020). The task now is to incorporate new online tools into ordinary
teaching activities and to determine the subject areas in which they are already best used and
where further progress is needed. As can be seen from the statistics obtained in different
countries, further challenges are linked to the teachers’ adaptability to tailor lectures for online
learning, to track synchronous or asynchronous interaction between students, and to build
authentic online appraisal resources that complement the shift from face-to-face courses to online
platforms (Watts, 2016).
To boost student performance, more efforts are required by all online educators to
combine pedagogy with technology. Among the various types of student engagement, learner-toinstructor engagement techniques seemed to be the most valued. Icebreaker/introduction
discussions and working collaboratively in groups by using online communication tools were
rated the most effective engagement strategies in the learner-to-learner category. Sending regular
announcements or reminders and providing an assessment scale for all assignments were rated
most valuable in the learner-to-instructor category. Also, online dialogue as an efficient
networking activity was found to be very motivational for students in the new online learning
environment. Thus student engagement increases student satisfaction, enhances student
motivation to learn, and improves student performance in the online learning environment. As a
result, teachers need a deeper understanding of how students perceive and react to elements of
online learning (because student expectations and attitudes are vital to motivation and learning)
along with how these methods can be more successfully implemented to improve learning
(Koohang & Durante, 2003). Students’ roles and responsibilities in collaborative groups are
clearly established and emphasized, and teachers' roles are changed from information providers
to facilitators of knowledge in online learning. It is better to involve and inspire students by
setting challenges to the students and implement it. Such students’ involvement increases
students’ satisfaction (Amena, 2020). This study calls for further studies on integrating
professional development seminars and educational workshops for ESP online learning and
teaching in order to encourage innovative ESP teaching methods for online learning and
alternative evaluation plans for teachers and students. The research aims to determine the level of
satisfaction of the students of three faculties at KNU Ukraine with ESP online learning channels
and learning environments during lockdown. Student satisfaction surveys may lead to changes in
ESP online learning activities that may, in turn, boost students’ outcomes. The results provide
valuable insight into students' satisfaction with online learning and pose practical questions for
its implementation. The study's research questions fell into four categories: the efficiency of
online ESP learning experience, the availability of learning material used by ESP instructors, the
assessment of ESP teachers' performance, the effectiveness of online testing, and students'
difficulties with ESP distance learning.

The analysis of the literature shows that most studies are conducted to classify students'
perceptions and attitudes toward online learning, and studies relating to students' perceptions of

online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic are rare and far between. There are different
terms presented for online education in the literature. Some of them are virtual education,
Internet-based education, web-based education, and education via computer-mediated
communication. The authors choose the definition of online education that is based on Keegan's
(1988) definition of distance education. Keegan (1996) analyzed reports of distance education
and incorporated the following form of education into five characteristics: separation of teacher
and learner throughout the length of the learning process; the impact of an academic institution
in the preparation and planning of learning materials as well as the availability of student support
services; the use of electronic media (print, audio, video, or computer) to link teacher and learner
and deliver course material; the availability of two-way communication so that the student may
benefit from or even initiate this form of communication (Keegan, 1996).
Sinclaire highlighted that online learning is a massive difference in how students learn and, in
addition, how students are taught. Therefore, the point is that there is a growing need to consider
what leads to student satisfaction with online learning (Sinclaire, 2011).
In creating a successful online program, Sener and Humbert (2003) claimed that
satisfaction is a vital component. Satisfaction can be characterized as "a definition that reflects
results and reciprocity between students and an instructor"(Thurmond, Wambach, Connors &
Frey, 2002, p.171). Learner satisfaction of a course is one of the significant pillars for evaluating
the success and efficacy of the course delivery. In evaluating student satisfaction with online
courses Richardson and Swan (2003) concentrated on the relationship of teacher social presence
in online learning that influenced students’ satisfaction. They discovered a strong connection
between the perceptions of students’ social involvement and their perceptions of online learning.
Bollinger (2004) found three constructs to be important: interactivity, teacher variables and
technology problems. Yet, developing an online environment that promotes student satisfaction
requires methods that go beyond facilitating interaction with components of the course.
Interaction with each other, between a student and a teacher and between students in the course,
often includes creating culture, among other elements. Sher (2009) discovered that interactions
between student and teacher and between students are essential factors in student satisfaction.
Multiple studies have shown that a student's active participation in the learning process improves
learning, a process known as active learning (Sarason & Banbury, 2004). Good learning results
were obtained by interactive teaching or “learning by doing” (Picciano, 2002).
When it comes to learner motivation, satisfaction, and engagement, the online learning
environment differs dramatically from the conventional classroom environment (Bignoux &
Sund, 2018). Because many new technologies and web-based activities are interactive, online
learning can build environments where students engage with the material and learn by doing,
improving their understanding as they build new skills (Johnston, Killion & Omomen, 2005).
Some pedagogical methods can be more easily converted into online learning and
distance learning environments than others. Teaching activities that rely heavily on instructor
lectures or the teacher assigning self-study materials are more readily transferable to online
learning environments than more advanced pedagogical approaches. Those approaches are
usually discovered where students complete the tasks that are more learner-centered or projectbased (Anderson & Dron, 2010). The surveys include a range of explanations why, with online

studies, students can learn successfully. Students have more influence over their research,
according to the findings, and have more choices available for reflection at their hands.
In the field of language education, teachers have taken an interest in modeling studentoriented courses using the latest web tools for courses that have been mainly instructor- oriented.
Based on the main functions and features of the language learning, online tools are grouped into
twelve categories (Son, 201l). For this study the authors chose the tools that are frequently used
during ESP classes at the university, such as content management, communication, live and
virtual worlds, social networking and bookmarking, resource sharing, Web exercise creation, and
Web search engines. ESP courses have similar challenges. The authors decided to research what
affects students’ satisfaction in learning ESP online and what learning tools lead to student
performance improvement in the lockdown.
Methods
The study's data are based on students' experiences completing an online ESP course
during lockdown. This research aims to determine the level of satisfaction of the students of
three faculties at KNU Ukraine with ESP online learning channels and learning environments
during lockdown. Data collected were analyzed using the Statistical Package JASP. Appropriate
statistical procedures for description (frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations)
were used. Students answered the questions in a Google questionnaire. Based on a literature
review, a questionnaire was developed to collect the necessary data. The questionnaire covered
four areas and consisted of a list of questions in each section. As research tools the authors also
chose observation, literature analysis, a questionnaire provision, and descriptive data analysis.
Research questions
The current study examines students’ answers to identify students’ satisfaction in ESP
online courses. The Google questionnaire was divided into four dimensions: the efficiency of
online ESP learning experience, availability of learning material used by ESP teachers,
assessment of ESP teachers’ performance, efficiency of online testing, and students’ challenges
with ESP distance learning. Questionnaires were sent out and consisted of 23 survey questions
sorted into four dimensions: How would you evaluate your ESP online course experience? How
would you assess the efficiency of ESP learning materials used in ESP classes? How would you
assess your ESP teacher’s performance in a virtual class? How would you consider ESP online
testing?
Participants
The site for this study was the Faculty of Economics, the Faculty of Biology, and the
Faculty of Geography where an ESP course is taught for students of the first and second years of
study at KNU, Ukraine.
This study used a selective student satisfaction evaluation model. The study population
was ESP students of three faculties of KNU of the first and second years of study who take ESP
courses and participate in online learning. The sampled group is made up of 167 students who
were targeted for the survey. The participants' ages range from 17-19. The survey was conducted
in English, and no translation was necessary to be added.

Research Procedures
Respondents who participated in the ESP online learning programs of three different
faculties were invited to complete the questionnaire. Responses to each question in the survey
were imported into a JASP statistical package from Google forms, and respondents’ complete
data for each question was put in the JASP interface. Anonymous completed questionnaires, and
the received results were analyzed. A descriptive–correlation survey approach was used in this
study.
Data Collection
The ESP students’ answers were collected and saved in the Google documents. Data were
collected over two months from October to December 2020. The survey took the participants
about eight minutes to complete. The 167 forms and the accompanying comments samples
formed the data set for subsequent analysis.
Findings
The questionnaire was divided into four sections where the first section highlighted the
ESP students’ satisfaction with their ESP learning experience online. In the second section of the
questionnaire, the students' satisfaction with the ESP learning materials offered and used by their
ESP teacher was assessed. In the third section the level of students’ satisfaction with their
teacher’s competence and performance online was evaluated. The fourth section of the survey
represented the student’s satisfaction with the transparency of online assessment.
How would you assess your ESP online course experience?
Regarding answering the questions in the first section: How would you assess your ESP
online course experience? Students reported that they were satisfied with the selected method,
facilitating their learning outcomes of the course’s objectives. Quantitative data were obtained by
asking students to indicate if they are satisfied or dissatisfied with a series of statements about
their experiences and preferences regarding the use of the online learning tools on a five point
Likert scale (1=Fair and 5=Excellent). The results from the survey suggest that the students view
online learning experience as satisfying. Table one provides a summary of the results obtained.
As indicated in Table one, the respondents rated two items as being of "high importance" and
sixth items as being of "average importance. " The two highest-rated items were “Willingness to
continue studying ESP online” and “Ability to meet the deadlines. " Analysis shows that the
students are mostly satisfied with the offered ESP online learning experience during the COVID19 pandemic. Furthermore, it was determined that course delivery methods and tools (4,396),
were effective during a rapid shift to online teaching during COVID-19. As a first-time
experience, the results showed a highly satisfactory achievement of learning outcomes.
Participants were satisfied with course engagement activities levels (4,317), ability to meet the
deadlines where the mean is (4,617) and the results obtained represent an increased ability to
manage time while studying online. Students reported a high level of motivation to learn ESP
online (4,377), their willingness to continue study ESP online showed more than good results
(4,377), increased opportunity to access and use information showed (4,120) that have a positive
attitude to online ESP experience where shift to online ESP learning increased attendance of ESP
courses (4,333).

How would you assess ESP learning materials used in ESP classes?
The answers given in the second section about students’ satisfaction with chosen learning
materials used in their online ESP course show that the most effective and convenient media for
ESP classes were ZOOM, Google Classroom, and Google Hangouts. The students’ perceptions
of the most effective online learning methods and platforms are varied. Quantitative data was
obtained by asking students to indicate if they have a positive perception of learning materials -1
or have a negative attitude - 0 to their experiences and preferences regarding the use of online
learning tools. Overall, the results from the survey suggest that the students view online learning
materials as effective. Concerning the ability to work with the ESP teachers’ guides on their
own, students reported that they could do it themselves (0,720). Students understand ESP course
requirements better in an ESP online course than in an in-class (0.738). They show high
satisfaction with online resources chosen by the ESP teachers (0,707). Overall, the students are
delighted with the online classes and the tools used for class deliveries.

How would you assess your ESP teacher’s performance in virtual class?
Regarding the questions in section three rating teacher’s competence and performance,
students assessed teachers in the online class overall (Good). They were almost satisfied with
teachers’ performance in a virtual class. The survey results suggest that the teachers’
performance in a virtual class is favorable for achieving learning outcomes. Table three provides
a summary of the results obtained. As indicated in Table three, the respondents rated one item as
being of "high importance" and five items as being of "average importance". The highest rated
item was “teacher’s presence in the virtual classes”, which represents a vital role of a teacher and
facilitator in online learning. The second - highest ranked thing was opportunities to collaborate
with other students during online ESP classes, group work and interactivity of classes (4,598)
which indicates the necessity of group work during ESP classes. Moreover, it was identified that
teacher’s communication was adequately effective and participants are satisfied with the means
of communication chosen by their ESP teacher (4,317). Surprisingly the time response from the
ESP teachers and feedback from them was not as quick as students expected, and answers to this
research question gave less than (4,287) satisfied students. Consequently, it influenced the final
result of students’ satisfaction with their teachers’ performance.

How would you assess ESP online testing?
In answering the fourth section on transparency and accuracy of ESP online testing,
students reported that they were satisfied with the selected online exam platforms, namely
Exam.net and Socrative which were highly rated by respondents. As indicated in Table four, the
respondents rated two items as "highly-rated" and four items as being "lower-rated". The results
from the survey suggest that online performance testing was assessed transparently and
accurately. Despite of the high level of difficulty of the exam tasks (4.741) it did not influence
the final result for the course. Monitoring academic performance in online ESP classes in its turn
was rated as higher than moderate (4.377), instructions were clear and easy to follow.

Discussion
The aim of this research was to investigate students' attitudes toward online ESP courses
in terms of social presence, social interaction, engagement and satisfaction. Furthermore, the aim
of this study was to investigate the perception of ESP online learning versus among students. The
survey results show that a level of course engagement activities leads to students’ motivation,
and having an opportunity to assess and use information with delivery methods and tools used by
their ESP teacher increases the student’s satisfaction with ESP online learning. Interactive
instruction or “learning by doing” resulted in positive learning outcomes (Picciano, 2002;
Watkins, 2005). Richardson and Swan (2003) concentrated on the relationship of teacher social
presence in online learning and students’ satisfaction. They discovered a strong connection
between the perceptions of students’ social involvement and their perceptions of online learning.

Our study showed that the four highest rated advantages of online learning were “teachers
presence in the virtual classes”, “flexibility in time and place”, “quick sharing of learning
materials for students and collaboration with other students”.
Moreover, online learning encourages students to work at their own speed to complete
their tasks. As a result, in order to experience class participation, instructors must have a solid
understanding of both theory and practice of online learning.
Conclusion
The unprecedented situation with COVID-19 had a significant impact on university
education in Ukraine. It is crucial to tailor and adjust teaching methods and tools and create a
favorable environment for teaching and online learning in universities. The quarantine gave a
push to rapid and effective transformations in the higher education system of Ukraine. Online
learning plays a vital role in higher education, it is important for universities to focus on
students’ perception and their expectations towards the role of online learning within their higher
education experiences.
This study concludes that the students are satisfied with the ESP teachers who created a
comfortable ESP online environment in times of COVID-19, where they agreed on specific
teaching rules to use, assessment choices, training workshops, and online technical support.
Students are also satisfied with the facilities provided by the ESP teachers.
Regarding their most effective online learning platforms, it is concluded that ZOOM is
the most effective tool for lecture delivery after Google Classroom.
Overall, all the students are delighted with online teaching during COVID-19. The study
revealed that the students are content with the assessment types. The assessment plans used by
teachers are perceived as favourable for gaining course knowledge and skills. An efficiently
tailored ESP online course uses various teaching tools and services to increase students’
performance. ESP online in the university offers more accessibility and freedom.
The effectiveness and success of ESP online courses at the university rely mainly on the
nature of the course content, the outline of the course content, the contact between the student,
and the teacher, and the availability of learning materials. The study found that teachers’
presence and support play an essential role in acquiring knowledge online. In both individual and
group work, teachers initiate interaction. ESP teachers respond to the learners' questions, design
projects, and evaluate their learning because student expectations and attitudes are vital to
motivation and learning. It is important to remember that technology may not be capable of
replacing a teacher. Our study showed that teachers’ communication was effective enough and
participants are satisfied with the means of communication chosen by their ESP teachers. If that
is the case, research needs to be done on a wide scale to promote the refinement of ESP teaching
and learning processes.
The study presented here focused on students’ satisfaction with ESP online learning
among students with mostly limited prior online learning experience. The findings provide
important insight into students’ satisfaction with online learning and raise practical

considerations for its implementation. This study is thus just an initial attempt at providing
insightful analysis to the policymakers of Ukraine.
Additional studies are recommended to extend research on both professors’ and students’
satisfaction with their overall perception, such as willingness to use online learning, their need
for educational technology, as well as technical assistance and training support. A gap actually
remains that needs to be filled. Future studies should perhaps be specifically concerned with
carrying out an in-depth analysis of the activities to be implemented, such as online training
practices, ESP online teaching, development process, and a more detailed course design
guidance. In order to promote new ESP teaching strategies for online learning and alternative
evaluation plans for teachers and students, this study calls for more research about incorporating
career development seminars and educational workshops for ESP online learning and teaching.
Collecting data on the benefits and challenges of online teaching and learning during the
unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic would also be appropriate for teachers and administrators
who are to design strategies for future crises.
