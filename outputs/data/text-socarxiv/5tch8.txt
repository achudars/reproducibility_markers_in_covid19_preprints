Abstract
Trust in science and experts is extremely important in times of epidemics to ensure compliance with public health measures. Yet little is
known about how this trust evolves while an epidemic is underway. In
this paper, we examine the dynamics of trust in science and experts
in real-time as the high-impact epidemic of Coronavirus (COVID-19)
unfolds in Italy, by drawing on digital trace data from Twitter and
survey data collected online via Telegram and Facebook. Both Twitter and Telegram data point to initial increases in reliance on and
information-seeking from scientists and health authorities with the
diffusion of the disease. Consistent with these increases, using a separately fielded online survey we find that knowledge about health information linked to COVID-19 and support for containment measures
was fairly widespread. Trust in science, relative to trust in institutions
(e.g. local or national government), emerges as a consistent predictor
of both knowledge and containment outcomes. However, over time and
as the epidemic peaks, we detect a slowdown and turnaround in reliance and information-seeking from scientists and health authorities,
which we interpret as signs of an erosion in trust. This is supported
by a novel survey experiment, which finds that those holding incorrect
beliefs about COVID-19 give no or lower importance to information
about the virus when the source of such information is known to be
scientific.

Even in the public, that stubbornness to deny the plague was
naturally giving way and losing itself as the disease spread, and
spread because of contact and practice; and even more so when
after having only been among the poor for some time, [the plague]
began to touch better known people. Alessandro Manzoni, The
Betrothed, ch. XXXI
The quote above comes from a 19th century Italian national literary classic in which the writer Alessandro Manzoni describes the plague outbreak
in Milan in the 1630s. In the novel, Manzoni vividly writes about moments
when the disease was already spreading but, due to misleading communication and mistrust in experts, few were inclined to take precautions for its
containment. However, “the stubbornness to deny” the epidemic gave way,
as the disease spread fast and the measures that were eventually taken to
contain it were as dramatic as the epidemic itself. As the novel coronavirus
(COVID-19) epidemic spreads across the world, Manzoni’s characterisations
of the dynamics of disease spread, public perceptions of it, and their willingness to respond to experts and modify behaviours, seem as relevant and
important to understand today.
Scientific research has brought multifarious benefits to people’s daily lives,
and public trust in science and in experts should be a natural extension of
science’s cultural achievements (Barber, 1990). Moreover, trust in science
and in scientific experts is essential to the functioning of modern, highly differentiated societies, where knowledge is highly specialized and complexity
is constantly growing (Luhmann, 1979). Aligned with this, people across the
world report fairly high levels of trust in science and in scientists (Gallup,
2019), and this trust often exceeds trust in other institutions such as government or media (Pew Research Center, 2019). Yet, the public health crisis
triggered by the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) since December
2019, has occurred in a landscape when forces questioning science and the
validity of expert opinions have gained greater visibility worldwide. In the
recent past, the so-called vaccination backlash (Shetty, 2010) resulted in a
return of measles in Europe and North America, and a broader environment
of mistrust of scientific experts and tensions between politics and science
have been noted in a number of countries and in the context of significant
issues such as climate change (Nature, 2017; Larson, 2016).
Trust in science and in experts is particularly important in times of epidemics such as COVID-19. Although empirical research analysing the relationship between public health and public trust remains limited, existing

literature indicates that variables linked to trust in experts and institutions
(e.g. national and local governments) are important correlates of citizens’
compliance with public health policies, restrictions and guidelines (Bavel
et al., 2020; Vinck et al., 2019; Blair et al., 2017; Siegrist and Zingg, 2014;
Gilles et al., 2011; Prati et al., 2011; Whetten et al., 2006). However, sustaining trust can be challenging in times of uncertainty and risk (Bavel et al.,
2020; Siegrist and Zingg, 2014; Larson and Heymann, 2010). For example, in
the early days of the Ebola epidemic in Western Africa in 2013, the lack of
trust in healthcare providers led affected families to hide sick family members
(Larson, 2016). Based on these experiences, the World Health Organization
(WHO henceforth) cited the lack of trust in the health system as a major
driver of the failure of the containment of the later Ebola outbreak (World
Health Organization, 2019).
Understanding how trust in science and in experts evolves in the context
of an unfolding epidemic is, therefore, crucial. Yet little is known about how
trust evolves during an epidemic. How does trust in science and experts
affect perceptions and knowledge about the disease while the epidemic is
underway? How does trust in science and health experts – compared with
trust in government institutions – affect the success of public health messaging and citizens’ support for containment policies? Here, we address these
questions by examining the dynamics of trust in science and experts in realtime as the high-impact epidemic of COVID-19 unfolds in Italy by leveraging
complementary sources of digital trace and survey data (including a survey
experiment) collected using three online platforms: Twitter, Telegram, and
Facebook.
As of end-April 2020, Italy was one of the most severely affected countries
by COVID-19. While each province in Italy had confirmed cases of the virus
by mid-March 2020, the diffusion of the outbreak has been very heterogeneous with the majority of cases being concentrated in Lombardy, one of the
wealthiest regions in the north of the country. Italian authorities have implemented draconian measures to tackle the COVID-19 outbreak.1 However,
especially at the beginning of the outbreak, media reports suggested that
the effectiveness of most of these measures was limited because the public
received them with reluctance (Giuffrida and Cochrane, 2020). As Italy enters the next stage of the management of the epidemic and steps are taken to
gradually loosen the ‘lockdown’ – and several other countries also confront
this next stage – a deeper understanding of how public trust in science and
experts has evolved over the course of the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as

the role of trust in shaping public attitudes towards public health measures
in the context of an ongoing pandemic is vital.
Given the continued diffusion of COVID-19 and the heterogeneity in the
levels of the contagion, Italy represents a relevant, timely, and interesting
case study to examine how trust in science and experts unfolds during an
epidemic. To understand these processes, we leverage primary data fielded
through a pre-registered online survey collected in four waves via the popular messaging app, Telegram, as well as digital trace data on geo-localised
Tweets. Using both these data sources, we first examine how the willingness to consult experts and authoritative sources of information regarding
COVID-19 evolves over time and space as the epidemic spreads. Second, using a separate, pre-registered survey experiment fielded to a geographicallytargeted pool of Facebook users in Northern Italy with varying proximity to
outbreak areas, we analyse beliefs and misperceptions regarding COVID-19
and assess if people’s willingness to modify misperceptions with respect to
the virus differs when the source of the same information is experimentally
manipulated.

Trust in experts and institutions is important in contexts where individuals
lack the knowledge to make decisions and are unable to evaluate and understand the risks associated with a hazard (Siegrist and Cvetkovich, 2000).
A public health crisis such as the COVID-19 outbreak provides such a setting, as existing research indicates that concepts linked to infectious diseases
(e.g. herd immunity) are often poorly understood by the public (Zingg and
Siegrist, 2012), and the outcomes of recommended behavioural measures for
disease control are not clearly, nor immediately, visible (Betsch, 2020).
Although trust is theoretically important for the management of pandemics, it is also likely to be affected by the diffusion of the outbreak. The
empirical literature on the dynamics of trust in science and experts in the
context of crises is scant. There is some evidence, however, that crises can
affect generalized trust and trust in authorities, but results point in different
directions. In their study of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in the three
most affected countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leon, Flückiger et al.
(2019) found that trust in central government (parliament and president)
and police increased in regions with higher exposure to the epidemic. Shupp
et al. (2017) showed, for instance, that people who were affected by a tornado exert an increased level of general trust but also an increased level of
trust in authorities and civil servants, such as police and firefighters. Evi4

dence on how long effects of changes in trust last is also mixed. For example,
Calo-Blanco et al. (2017) showed that trust and social cohesion increased
after a large-scale earthquake but slowly weakened as environmental conditions improved over time. In contrast, Aassve et al. (2020) found that the
spread of the Spanish flu of 1918 is negatively and significantly correlated
with generalized trust in the United States today.
The above-mentioned studies examine trust outcomes after the crisis; how
these changes occur as these events are underway is less well understood. An
exception here is van der Weerd et al. (2011) who analysed the dynamics of
trust in government during the H1N1 pandemic in the Netherlands and found
that it decreased during the outbreak. The reasons recorded in their survey
for weakening trust changed during the course of the pandemic, with the
most reported reason being the perception that information was incomplete
or withheld, to a belief in the later stage that the threat had been exaggerated
by the government. Heterogeneity in the intensity of the outbreak may also
affect dynamics of trust, as suggested by Fong and Chang (2011) who found
that trust was not a significant predictor of community actions during the
SARS outbreak in Taiwan where larger outbreaks occurred. These findings
suggest that a perceived inability to control an outbreak may erode trust in
authorities.
In light of the above, we hypothesize that, on average, trust and attention
to scientific sources of information increase as a first reaction to the outbreak
through an unconditional reliance on experts when facing an increased level
of risk. However, this effect may begin to decrease over time as the epidemic
continues to spread and as frustration against experts as well as authorities
sets in who are perceived as unable to stop the diffusion of the disease. We
anticipate that these dynamics of an increase followed by a stall to occur
especially in areas that are affected at a later time, following a reversed Ushaped curve. In areas that are hit unexpectedly first, we expect frustration
to erode trust as time from initial outbreak passes.2
At the individual level, we expect trust in science to be positively correlated with better knowledge about health information linked to the virus, as
well as acceptance of containment policies. We expect that those who trust
science are also more receptive to information derived from experts while
those with weaker trust in science tend to trust even less the information
coming from experts during an epidemic.

We used the Twitter API to download all geo-located tweets posted between
February 25 and April 15, 2020, including either of the three most popular
hashtags related to the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy (further details in M4).
Using this dataset, we study how social media attention given to scientists
evolves over time and space as the virus spreads. We first focus on mentions
to scientists’ Twitter accounts to assess: 1) how attention given to scientists
changes over time in the period between the end of February, when the first
case of the virus is identified in Italy, until mid-April, by when Italy was
widely believed to have passed the (first) peak,3 and 2) whether subjects
located closer to cases of contagion are over-, or underrepresented – that is,
if citizens from these areas have a specific propensity to mention scientists.
We also compare changes in attention to scientists relative to other Twitter
accounts from categories, including health authorities (e.g. WHO, Italian
Institute for Public Health), authorities (e.g. government, regions, municipalities), politicians, media, and a residual category of other that regroups
all accounts, for which increases in volume denotes a dispersion of attention
away from those most closely associated with information on COVID-19.
Figure 1 and Table S3 in Supplementary Information S3.1 show the results of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions as described in section M4
in the Methods section. Figure 1 (first panel) and column (3) of Table S3 in
Supplementary Information S3.1 show that trust in scientists, as proxied by
Twitter mentions to scientists, increases with time as the disease outbreak
spreads but then stalls. Further exploring the heterogeneity of this effect by
the intensity of disease spread, we detect that this (non-monotonic) reversedU-shape pattern is driven by low and medium diffusion areas of the disease
outbreak. The (non-monotonic) reversed-U shape also appears in Figure
2 (first panel) and column (1) of Table S4 where we focus on the average
number of retweets (instead of mentions) per day for the three most mentioned scientist (Roberto Burioni, Ilaria Capua, Nino Cartabellotta) during
the same period.
We further explore how attention paid to health authorities, authorities,
politicians and media evolves over time and by disease intensity (columns
4–18 of Table S3 and columns 2–5 of Table S4 in Supplementary Information
S3.1). Figures 1 and 2 highlight the categories for which non-monotonic
patterns of heterogeneity by time and disease intensity are statistically sig3

nificant. Similarly to scientists, we see initial increases in retweets of health
authorities and authorities, as shown in Figure 2 over time, with a turnaround
occurring in mid-March 2020, after the lockdown corresponding to the uptick
in the number of deaths as shown in Figure S1 in S1. The volume of retweets
of health authorities in particular is sizeable compared with the other two
categories. Further, we see a shift in the categories that are mentioned over
time, with decreasing attention to scientists and increases towards politicians. The biggest increases in mentions to politicians are in low to medium
diffusion areas of the disease, which are the areas where mentions to scientists
experience declines.

Similar patterns are observed in the data we collected via an opt-in survey
on the popular messaging app Telegram. In the survey, which was run on
a channel of 60 000+ participants, we asked users about their desire (on a
scale from 1 to 8) to receive information about the novel coronavirus from
different sources, specifically: 1) doctors and scientists, 2) the government
and local administration (authorities), 3) health authorities (e.g. WHO), and
4) celebrities (from show-business and sports). The first wave took place on
February the 27th, 6 days after the discovery of the first case in Italy. The
other waves were conducted on March 5, March 13 (just after the lockdown
in Italy and corresponding to the descending path in the scientists panel on
Figure 1 and to the the ascending path in the number of deaths, as shown in
Figure S1 in S1), and March 20. Data from this survey allows us to directly
track changes in self-reported preferences of individuals over time and space.
Figure 3 and Table S5 in Supplementary Information S3.2 summarise
the results. Already at the first wave at the end of February, we observe
that interest in receiving information from scientists and health authorities
is higher than from other sources (authorities and celebrities). For each of
the three categories of scientists, government authorities, and health authorities, there is a sizeable and significant overall increase of interest over time,
and in several cases also from one wave to the following one; a decreasing
pattern emerges instead for celebrities. However, both categories of experts –
scientists and health authorities – feature a U-shaped pattern by which inter8

est increases until the third wave but then starts decreasing. Interest keeps
increasing instead for authorities, perhaps unsurprisingly given the larger
importance that public bodies bear when emergency laws are being put in
place. For reference, the national lockdown was established on March 10,
halfway through between the second and third wave.
Examining heterogeneity by outbreak intensity (as measured by the same
indicator as in the Twitter analyses, weighted case count (wcc) per province
as described in Section M5, Table S6 in Supplementary Information S3.2
suggests that people living in areas where the disease diffusion is higher are
more willing to receive information from all categories but celebrities. This
effect is statistically significant for information from scientists.

Trust in science, compliance and willingness to update
wrong beliefs
We recruited via the Facebook ads platform a geographically targeted pool
of online respondents and administered a pre-registered survey and a survey
experiment. The exact wording of this survey’s questions and of the treatment manipulation are reported in Supplementary Information S2.2. Our
sampling strategy consisted of targeting 15 provinces in Lombardy (9) and
Veneto (6), the two regions in northern Italy that were affected first by the
pandemic. More specifically, our sampling strategy included a detailed ge9

ographical targeting of some specific municipalities within those regions (in
the provinces of Lodi and Padova) that experienced the earliest outbreaks
and were quarantined since February 21st and some specific municipalities
(in the province of Bergamo) that also experienced an early outbreak but
were not quarantined until March the 10th.4 The targeted provinces were
the provinces where the spread of the infection was faster and the virus hit
hardest. This is clear both from Figures S9 in Supplementary Information
S3.3, showing the wcc value calculated from the geographical coordinates of
the respondents, and from S10 in Supplementary Information S3.3 showing
province-level data on cases tested positive for COVID-19 on March the 17th.
The survey experiment was administered from March 17th to March the
30th, i.e, corresponding to the part of Figures 1 and 2 where Twitter mentions
and retweets to scientists is descending, and when a slowdown in informationseeking from scientists and health authorities also emerges in the Telegram
survey between waves 3 and 4.5 The survey was also administered after the
lockdown, when significant restrictions to movement had been imposed, and
in a period where the COVID-19 mortality toll was continuously growing (See
Figure S1 in S1). In the survey questionnaire, we asked respondents about
the perceived importance of containment measures that had been implemented by the Italian government. Furthermore, we investigated knowledge
about health information linked to the coronavirus through our survey experiment. This health information – the source of which was experimentally
manipulated – was widely available on the website of Italian Institute for
Public Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanità).6 We apply post-stratification
weights in our analyses to conform our sample to the Italian population along
demographic characteristics (age, gender, and education).
Figure S13 in Supplementary Information S3.3 shows that by the secondhalf of March 2020, public health messages on the importance of social distancing and the isolation of positive cases had been widely received by the
public, with more than 70% of the respondents assigning a value of 10 to
the importance of social distancing, more than 90% assigning a value 10 to
the importance of isolation of COVID-positive cases and more than 80% as4

the Telegram survey.

signing value 10 to the importance of social distancing in particular for the
elderly.7 Trust in science is found to be the most consistent predictor of
agreement with measures of social isolation and social distancing (see Tables S10 – S13, and Figure S14 in Supplementary Information S3.3), net of
a range of socio-demographic control variables and as shown in the upper
panel of Figure 4.8 When we examine trust variables separately the largest
coefficients in terms of magnitude are that of trust in science and trust in the
Italian Institute for Public Health, as shown on Table S14 in Supplementary
Information S3.3. Trust in science is mostly closely aligned with trust in the
Institute for Public Health, and when computing an average between trust in
science and in the Italian Institute for Public Health, and a separate average
for trust in institutions (see Table S13 in Supplementary Information S3.3)
only for former remains significant while the latter is not.
Knowledge about information linked to the coronavirus was also generally
widespread in our sample, although this varied for different types of information. As shown in Figure S13 in Supplementary Information S3.3, weighted
mean scores on all four questions linked to the coronavirus were generally
high. Using a score of 10 (on a scale of 0 to 10) for complete accuracy,
around 50% of the respondents knew that younger people are also at risk of
contracting the coronavirus, and more than 70% knew that washing hands is
important in preventing the coronavirus infection. Knowledge about other,
more technical questions was comparatively less accurate – just over 30%
knew that antibiotics are not helpful in treating the infection, and around
30% knew that it is safe to receive parcels from China or other countries
where the virus has been identified. The middle panel of Figure 4 (and Figure S15 in Supplementary Information S3.3) mirror the results obtained so
far by showing that trust in science is inversely proportional to the probability of having wrong beliefs about the virus. More specifically, Table S15
shows that a one point increase (on a scale from 0 to 100) in trust in science is related to a 1% decrease in the probability to hold incorrect beliefs
across specifications, net of a range of socio-demographic controls. As with
the agreement with social distancing measures, trust in science is a consistent predictor also of knowledge about information linked to coronavirus.
7

The exact wording of these questions reads as follows: On a scale from 0 to 10 in
order to reduce the spread of the virus, how it is important in your opinion to: 1) Reduce
the movement of individuals even if they have not tested positive for the virus, 2) Home
isolation for those who tested positive for the virus, 3) That older people avoid leaving
their homes.
8
When using in the same model trust in science, trust in institutions, and trust in
the National Institute for Public Health, the only significant coefficient is that of trust in
science.

Furthermore, those who were better informed about the coronavirus are also
more supportive of containment policies for two out of three questions, as
revealed by the bottom panel of Figure 4 (and Figure S15 in Supplementary
Information S3.3).
Our treatment manipulation proceeded by asking three pieces of information about the coronavirus. In each of these cases, we first asked respondents
for an answer, and then exposed them to information on the same topic
by using directly relevant quotations from the website of the Italian Institute for Public Health. When providing them this current information, we
randomised the framing (i) quoting the text as coming from public health
experts, (ii) providing the same statement without any source. Finally, we
asked if the subject wanted to change his/her responses to their original answers once the new information was provided. This exogenous treatment manipulation allow us to answer the question of whether the information source
changes the propensity to adjust the respondents’ beliefs (when wrong). The
exact wording of the treatment manipulation is reported in Supplementary
Information S2.2.
The results of this exogenous treatment manipulation are depicted in
Figure 5. The bars represent marginal effect plots of treatment effect for each
one of the four questions9 while the right panels plot the marginal effects
of the interaction between information received by experts (our treatment
manipulation) and the average distance from early outbreak areas described
above.10
Figure 5 show that those holding incorrect beliefs about the disease give
no (for the question about antibiotics being effective in preventing the coronavirus infection –i.e., panel B.1 – and that on the importance of washing
hands –i.e., panel D.1 of Figure 5) or significantly lower (for the question
about younger people being also at risk of contracting the coronavirus infection –i.e., panel A.1 – and that about receiving parcels from China –i.e.,
panel C.1 of Figure 5) importance to information when the source of such
information is known to be scientific.11 These results are also confirmed by
a simplified version of the survey experiment nested within the last wave of
the Telegram survey (details are available in the Methods Section M5).
9

Are younger people also at risk of contracting the coronavirus? Are antibiotics helpful
in preventing the new coronavirus infection? Is it safe to receive parcels from China or
other countries where the virus has been identified? Is washing hands really useful in
preventing the coronavirus infection?
10
Given the purposely localized targeting chosen for this analysis, distance from the
initial outbreak areas can be interpreted both as a measure of duration of exposure and
intensity of exposure.
11
Our randomization worked well: see table S8 in Supplementary Information S3.3.

These main results are corroborated by a number of sensitivity tests where
we make use of different measures of trust and of distance from early outbreak
areas as described in Section M6 and as shown in Tables S10–S14, Tables S15–
S20, Tables S21 – S22, and in Tables S23–S26 in Supplementary Information
S3.3.
Panels A.2, B.2, C.2, and D.2 of Figure 5 further show that the reluctance
to update wrong beliefs in two out of four outcomes is more pronounced for
those living closer to early outbreak areas (i.e., the red line being significantly
higher than the light blue line in Panel A.2 and C.2 of Figure 5). This is
consistent with an idea of erosion of trust in experts due to frustration as
time passes and the disease outbreak spreads. These results experimentally
corroborate the patterns suggested by the digital traces and the Telegram
survey, which showed that during the period that our survey experiment was
(unintentionally) fielded, indicators linked to trust in scientists and health
authorities were descending.

Drawing on digital trace and survey data, our study shows how trust in experts has evolved in Italy in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Shortly
after the identification of the first cases of COVID-19 in Italy in February
2020, both Twitter and Telegram data pointed to initial increasing attention
and information-seeking from scientists and health authorities. However, we
found a stall in this increase, and in particular on Twitter, where data are
available over a longer period of time, we detected declines in social media
attention to scientists and health authorities after mid-March 2020, taking
the form of a reversed-U-shape.
Complementing Twitter and Telegram, we administered a separate survey to Facebook users geographically targeting two northern Italian regions
with significant disease outbreaks to examine individual knowledge about
the virus, support for containment policies, as well as experimentally assess
trust in experts. The increasing willingness to consult expert sources, as
suggested by the Telegram and Twitter data in the period leading up to the
Facebook survey, was also reflected in knowledge outcomes. In the survey,
we found generally high levels of public understanding of information about
the disease as well as support for containment measures. Better knowledge
was also correlated with greater support for containment measures.
However – echoing the signs of a declining levels of attention to scientists and health authorities in Twitter and Telegram – our survey experiment found that individuals with incorrect information about the virus were

either not or less willing to correct it when receiving information from a
scientific source than when the source of the same information was not explicitly stated. Examining geographical heterogeneity, we found that those
living closer to early outbreak areas with longer exposure to the outbreak
were less willing to update their incorrect beliefs.
Our findings, across the different, complementary data sources suggest
an erosion of trust in scientists and scientific authorities in Italy with longer
exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following from our hypotheses, we interpret these dynamics to suggest that over time, and with continued disease
diffusion and inability to curb it, frustration emerges that weakens trust. In
the survey experiment, this effect is most clear in areas close to the early outbreaks areas and that witnessed already two weeks of quarantine. In these
areas, although average levels of knowledge about the virus and support for
containment was high, with time by late-March, a lack of willingness to modify beliefs in response to expert information appeared among those holding
incorrect beliefs. Although by the time of the survey experiment we did not
see this effect in other areas, these results suggest that it may appear with
longer duration of exposure and if perceptions of an inability to manage the
outbreak also take root in other places.
A shortcoming of our data is that they do not enable us to disentangle the mechanisms behind the erosion of trust. While we hypothesize that
the inverted U-shape would be caused by a mechanism of frustration with
the inability to curb an epidemic, we nevertheless recognize that potentially
fragmented scientific communication (due to the often heterogeneous positions about the coronavirus among experts themselves) is also a plausible
mechanism for the erosion of trust. Indeed, the results of a poll conducted
by an Italian observatory on trust in science in March and April 2020 show
that public opinion about scientists communication activities in Italy was
divided (Observa Science in Society, 2020). Almost one Italian out of two
believed that the diversity of opinions given by experts in their interventions
created confusion (48%); and 8% positively acknowledged the competence
of the Italian scientific experts in the merit, while negatively assessed their
communicative ability. The same study, however, shows that perceptions
about risk did not diminish, but instead increased over the period between
March and April, as did the share of those supporting the idea of staying at
home.
It is nonetheless plausible that different mechanisms underlie frustration
in different areas, varying by the extent of their local outbreaks. For example,
in high intensity areas, where our survey experiment was administered, longer
exposure without resolution may erode trust, whereas in low-intensity areas,
a weaker perception of a threat and the continuation of stringent containment

measures may affect trust. This latter pattern is suggested by the Twitter
data, where the reversed-U-shape in attention to scientists is driven by lowand medium-intensity outbreak areas. Our results nevertheless suggest that,
although in the face of a new threat, trust and reliance on scientists and experts increases – continued trust is not inevitable, and trust is itself affected
by the dynamics of the pandemic. Even when the pandemic is underway, our
results point to the importance of trust in science and public health authorities, which emerges as a resilient predictor of both public health knowledge
and containment support. To sustain public trust in science throughout a
crisis, our study points to the need for clear, sustained and transparent channels of information communication from scientific authorities to the public
to anticipate and guard against frustration.

Data and methods

Twitter Analysis

The sample of geo-located tweets was obtained by downloading through the
Twitter API all tweets posted between February 25 and April 15, 2020, containing at least one of the three most popular hashtags linked to the COVID19 outbreak in Italy: #coronavirusitalia, #covid19italia, and #covid19italy.
This resulted in 12232 tweets, posted by 4755 unique users. Each tweet
has on average 0.43 mentions, that is, references to other Twitter accounts,
resulting in a total of 5318 mentions. First, all profiles mentioned 3 times or
less were flagged as “unclassified”. Then, a category “foreigner” was made
to include all individual accounts (hence excluding media outlets and health
organizations) that mostly tweeted in languages other than Italian. Then,
all 362 remaining accounts were manually classified into the following categories: “politicians”, “scientists”, “authorities”, “health authorities”, “media”, “journalists” and a residual category “other”. All categories defined
this way are mutually exclusive.
The “authorities” category includes official accounts of public entities
such as Twitter accounts of government, regions, municipalities, as well as
embassies; the “health authorities” category includes authorities and institutes focusing on health, such as the Italian Health Institute and the
World Health Organization (WHO)); the “scientists” category includes instead only personal accounts of individual scientists and researchers, regardless of whether the owner holds a position in hospitals, universities, research
centres or public administration.
The resulting data are analysed using the following model:

where category is the number of mentions to Twitter users in a given
class, wcc is a measure of the intensity of the diffusion of the disease and is
calculated as the per-province number of cases at date of tweet, weighted by
the inverse of the square of the distance from each province, and total is the
total number of mentions (to users in any category) as a control for overall
Tweet volume. The model specification includes also latitude to account for
the well-known North-South Italian gradient in behaviors. Equation (1) is
estimated using OLS with standard errors robust to heteroskedasticity.
The sample of retweets is composed by the retweets for the three most
cited accounts within each category12 in each category in the previously described dataset. This resulted in 54,263 retweets. Each tweet has on average
67 retweets, resulting in a total of 3,239,575 retweets. Retweets are analysed by estimating Equation (2) using OLS with standard errors robust to
heteroskedasticity.

Continuous survey via Telegram

Each wave of the interview was triggered by sending an invitation in a popular
Telegram channel, covid19, dedicated to the diffusion of news (in Italian)
about the pandemic. During the days elapsed between the first and the fourth
wave, the channel grew from around 50,000 to around 70,000 members. In
total, we obtained 3,925 valid participant/wave combinations. The exact
wording of the questions asked during the 4 waves of the data collection
via Telegram is reported in the Supplementary Information S2.1. The first
three waves were conducted entirely within the Telegram app, through a bot
that interacted with participants asking the questions in sequence. In the
fourth wave of the Telegram survey, in addition to the usual questions, an
abbreviated form of the survey experiment administered to Facebook users
was run on the Telegram pool by directing users to a Google Form survey.

We geo-localized respondents based on their ZIP codes. Given some technical
issues, only 3592 out of 9025 survey responses were actually geo-localized.
Data obtained from Telegram are analysed by estimating Equation (3)
by OLS with standard errors robust to heteroskedasticity:
AAA = β0 + β1 time + β2 distance + β3 time ∗ wcc + β4 latitude

(3)

540

As with the Twitter analyses before, wcc is a measure of the intensity of
the diffusion of the disease and is calculated as the per province-number of
cases at date of the survey, weighted by the inverse of the distance from each
province.
In terms of sample, Figure S3 in Supplementary Information S3.2, top,
displays the distribution of respondents across age ranges. Consistently
with the typical users of a Telegram channel, respondents are predominantly
young, although this heterogeneity slightly decreases from the first wave to
the following ones. Also heterogeneous, albeit less markedly, is the distribution by gender, with a larger proportion of male users, although the gender
gap decreases over time. To account for these demographic biases of our
sample, we use post-stratification weights for age, gender and education to
re-weight the sample to match the Italian population along these dimensions.
The weights are obtained through via iterative proportional fitting.
Figure S4 in Supplementary Information S3.2 displays the density of responses across Italy, based on the ZIP code of respondents. While each Italian
region is covered, the responses are most frequent in Lombardy, followed by
Veneto, the two regions most affected by the outbreak, particularly in the
initial phase. Further details on the Italian outbreak and its mortality toll is
shown in Figures S10 and S1. This suggests that members of the Telegram
channel, which is specifically devoted to information on COVID-19, might
have self-selected depending on their proximity to, and hence interest in, the
outbreak.

Survey experiment via Facebook Ads

We recruited a geographically targeted online sample using the Facebook
ads platform. Facebook is among the most widely used online social media
platforms in Italy, and nearly 60% of the Italian population ages 18 and over
are monthly active Facebook users.13
13

Information retrieved from the Facebook ads API indicates there are 30 million Facebook monthly active users over the age of 18 as of April 21, 2020

We targeted specific municipalities, including both the early outbreak areas as well as those surrounding them, in the two provinces of Lombardy
and Veneto, as described in further detail in Section S3.3. Respondents that
opted in and clicked the ad were enrolled into the subject pool for the Centre
for Experimental Social Sciences at Nuffield College. To minimise topical
self-selection (Lehdonvirta et al., 2020) (e.g recruiting respondents with unusually greater interest in the coronavirus), our recruitment ad avoided any
mentions to the content of our survey and only implied that survey respondents were sought for the CESS subject pool. Subsequently, the survey link
was sent out to all those who entered the subject pool through the ad, and
was administered via Qualtrics. The survey ran from March the 17th to
March the 30th and we received a total of 994 completed responses. The exact wording of the questions administered is reported in the Supplementary
Information S2.2.
The data have been analysed using the following model:
Outcomei = α + δ1i + δ2i + δ3 × Zc,l + i

Where Outcomei is the outcome of interest, δ1i , and δ2i are a set of control
variables including gender, age, dummies for educational attainment (secondary, bachelor, master and higher), dummies for marital status (married,
cohabiting, divorced, widow), a dummy for having children, dummies for employment status (housewife, employed, retired, student, other), mathematical
skills, self-placement of a left-right scale, a dummy for Lombardy, a dummy
for Veneto, and Latitude. The models include also a measure of distance
from early outbreak areas computed as follows: we geo-localized respondents
based on their ZIP codes and we calculated for each respondent the average distance from the three main early outbreak municipalities of Codogno
(Province of Lodi, Lombardy Region), Nembro (Province of Bergamo, Lombardy Region), and Vo’ Euganeo (Province of Padua, Veneto Region). In
some specifications we used, instead of the average distance, a dummy variable assuming value 1 if respondents were located within a radius of 20 Km
from the three initial outbreak municipalities. The estimated models also
include measures of trust in science and institutions as described in Table S7
in Supplementary information S3.3. Note that a cross-correlation table for
these measures is depicted in Table S9 in Supplementary information S3.3.
Table S7 in Supplementary information S3.3 show the summary statistics
for the variables used along the empirical analysis. We estimate our models
either through OLS or Logit models (marginal effects) with robust standard
errors clustered at the province-level. We refer the reader to the Supplementary Information S3.3 for an in-depth description of the data and of the

sensitivity checks conducted.
Research on the Italian setting has shown that Facebook is an effective
survey recruitment tool that did not indicate any systematic demographic or
psychometric biases (Kalimeri et al., 2020). Nonetheless, to account for potential demographic biases of an online, non-probability sample, our analyses
applied post-stratification weights by age, gender and education to conform
our sample to the Italian population.

Coronavirus pandemic and containment measures
adopted by the Italian government in the aftermath
of the outbreak

On Friday 21st the first case of Coronavirus was discovered in a town located in the province of Lodi, in the region of Lombardy in northern Italy.
Almost simultaneously another Italian citizen from a small municipality in
the province of Padua, in the Veneto region, was found to be positive for
the Coronavirus. Two days later, on February 23, the government issued a
decree which prohibited the movement of people outside 10 municipalities
located in Lombardy and a municipality in Veneto, all indicated in red in
Figure S7. However, the decree did not have immediate implementation.
The control plan did not start rigidly, and checkpoints were not very effective: in fact, there were numerous leaks towards other provinces and regions
in southern Italy. Law enforcement officers (at least 500 men) were deployed
two days later in order to avoid further leaks. Although cases in the province
of Bergamo began also to increase at an alarming rate, in contrast to Lodi,
no further shutdowns or restrictions were imposed. In the following days,
despite constant calls to limit travel and to adopt preventive measures such
as avoiding gatherings and enclosed spaces, many Italians took advantage of
the temporary closure of the schools decided by the government, to move to
the mountains or to the sea. From March the 8th the restriction to avoid any
movement was extented to the whole of Lombardy and to fourteen provinces
of Veneto, Emilia Romagna, Piedmont, and Marche. The decree, however,
was leaked by the press already in the late evening of March the 7th, generating panic and once more substantial movement of people from the northern
regions towards the south. On March the 10th, a new decree of the Prime
Minister Giuseppe Conte, extended these lockdown measures across the entire country of Italy until May the 4th when the country started a mild
reopening.
In the week that followed the discovery of the first case, Italy experienced a very rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths (See figure
S1). This growth was uneven with the majority of cases (and deaths) being concentrated in the north of the country and, particularly, in Lombardy
which roughly counts half of the total number of deaths (see right panel of
Figure S1. As a yardstick, on February the 27th (the day of the first Telegram survey) the cumulative number of deaths amounted to 10. By the end
of the fourth wave of the Telegram survey Italy had registered 4000 deaths.

26

723
724

Accordingly, at the beginning of the survey experiment (which took place
entirely after the lockdown) Italy had witnessed more then 1000 deaths, by
the end of the survey they were more than 11000.

“According to the National Institute for Public Health experts
hand washing and disinfection are the key to preventing infection. You must
wash your hands often and thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20
seconds (better 40-60). If soap and water are not available, an alcohol-based
hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol can also be used. The virus enters
the body through the eyes, nose and mouth, so avoid touching them with
unwashed hands.”

Figure 3 shows the unbalanced analysis of changes of interest in different
categories of information sources across waves; the equivalent balanced analysis is displayed in Figure S5. Both figures clearly show that interest in all
sources of information is increasing from wave to wave except for the category
“famous persons from the show business and sports”, and that these changes
are statistically significant. Minor differences between the unbalanced and
balanced version are likely due to two main phenomena. On one hand, the
sample changed significantly across waves (in turn a consequence of the huge
increase in the popularity of the Telegram channel) On the other hand, it
was not always possible to track participants across waves: in particular, in
wave 4 participants filled the survey outside the Telegram app and had the
possibility to not being matched to their responses in previous waves.
The fourth and last wave of the Telegram survey included a simplified
version of the survey experiment: subjects were randomly sent (via personalized links) to one out of two versions of the survey. In both versions of the
survey, respondents were asked to answer the question “Are younger people
also at risk of contracting the Coronavirus?” by picking an answer from 0
to 10 after reading the text of the ISS information about all age categories
being at risk: but while in one version ISS was cited as source, in the other
version no source was provided.
In both versions of the survey, 10 was the most chosen option, but it
was chosen more frequently (77.5% vs. 75.6%) when the source of the state44

ment was not mentioned, consistently with results from the Facebook Ad
experiment: Figure S6 shows that most of the difference is explained by respondents who chose a number between 6 and 9, rather than 19. However,
when regressing the choice of 10 as response over the treatment selection
(controlling for standard demographics – age, gender, level of studies), we
obtain that the difference is only marginally significant (p = 0.10).

We administered to Facebook users residing in 15 provinces in Lombardy14
and Veneto15 , two regions located in northern Italy, a pre-registered survey and a survey experiment. We specifically targeted two early outbreak
areas which were quarantined since February 21st (including 10 municipalities in Lombardy and 1 in Veneto), as well as municipalities bordering with
these initial outbreak municipalities for a total of 66 municipalities (46 in
Lombardy and 20 in Veneto). We then separately targeted an area in the
province of Bergamo (BG) which has been severely affected by the epidemic
(Buonanno et al., 2020) and the municipalities bordering this area for a total of 32 municipalities. Figure S7 provides a visual representation of those
early outbreak municipalities. For a description of the early outbreak Italian
areas and a discussion on the differential policies implemented by the Italian government in each of them see Rotondi et al. (2020). The geographical

respondents even outside the initially targeted areas, as shown in Figure S8.
Participants in the online survey were offered a modest payment.

Tables The following tables show:
S10 The relationship between trust and perceived importance of social distancing measures. Observations are weighted to conform to the national population.
S11 The relationship between trust and perceived importance of social distancing measures. Observations are weighted. It includes a continuous
variable for distance from outbreak areas instead of a dummy.
S12 The relationship between trust and perceived importance of social distancing measures. Observations are not weighted.
S13 The relationship between trust and perceived importance of social distancing measures. Observations are not weighted. Trust in science is
the average between trust in science and trust in the Italian institute
for public health. Trust in politicians is the average between trust in
regional and national government.
S14 The relationship between trust and perceived importance of social distancing measures. Observations are not weighted. It includes the measures of trust in different models: trust in the Italian institute for public
health (column 1), trust in regional government (column 2), trust in
national government (column 3), trust in science (column 4) and all
measures of trust (column 5). Note that the coefficient for trust in
science is greater than the coefficient for any other trust measure.
S15 The relationship between trust and wrong beliefs. Observations are
weighted to conform to the national population.
S16 The relationship between trust and wrong beliefs. Observations are not
weighted.
S16 The relationship between trust and wrong beliefs. Observations are not
weighted.
S17 The relationship between trust and wrong beliefs. Observations are not
weighted. It includes a continuous variable for distance from outbreak
areas instead of a dummy.
S18 The relationship between trust and wrong beliefs. Observations are not
weighted. Trust in science is the average between trust in science and
trust in the Italian institute for public health. Trust in politicians is
the average between trust in regional and national government.

S19 The relationship between trust and wrong beliefs measured on a scale
from 0 to 10 as in the original questionnaire. Observations are not
weighted.
S20 The relationship between trust and wrong beliefs. Observations are not
weighted. It is estimated by Logit and marginal effects are reported.
S21 The relationship between holding wrong beliefs and support for containment measures. Holding wrong beliefs is measured with a dummy
taking value 1 if the respondent has been at least wrong across the
4 treatment questions. Observations are weighted to conform to the
national population.
S22 The relationship between holding wrong beliefs and support for containment measures. Holding wrong beliefs is measured as the sum of
the distance from the correct answer (0 or 10) across the 4 treatment
questions. Observations are weighted to conform to the national population.
S23 The treatment effect: i.e., receiving information for experts and willingness to update beliefs (when wrong). Observations are weighted to
conform to the national population.
S24 The treatment effect: i.e., receiving information for experts and willingness to update beliefs (when wrong). Observations are not weighted.
S25 The treatment effect: i.e., receiving information from experts and willingness to update beliefs (when wrong). Observations are not weighted.
It includes a continuous variable for distance from outbreak areas instead of a dummy.
S26 The treatment effect: i.e., receiving information from experts and willingness to update beliefs (when wrong). Observations are weighted
to conform to the national population. It is estimated by Logit and
marginal effects are reported.
S27 The interaction between receiving information from experts and a) science (columns 1–4), b) distance from outbreak areas (columns 5–8).
Observations are weighted to conform to the national population.
