Sickness-related Absences During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role
of Occupations
Abstract
During the pandemic, work is exposing many workers to extensive health risks, with workplace
infections a major source of COVID-19 outbreaks. The experience of work is substantially different by
occupation, and “essential” occupations consist of disproportionately low-SES and non-White workers.
Documenting occupational health disparities during the pandemic is therefore crucial for understanding
COVID-19 health inequalities in the United States. This study uses the Current Population Survey
microdata combined with occupational data from multiple sources to estimate occupational differences in
sickness-related absences from work in March – June 2020 and their contribution to income, educational,
and racial/ethnic differences in health inequalities. We find that there has been an unprecedented rise in
absences compared to previous years, highly concentrated in transportation, food-related, and personalcare and service occupations. In areas with a major COVID-19 outbreak, these occupations saw rates of
absence 6 times higher than all non-healthcare professional occupations. Occupations with the greatest
increase in absences are those that are unsuitable for remote work, require workers to work in close
proximity to others, pay low wages and rarely provide health insurance. These occupations are, on
average, disproportionately non-White, immigrant, low-SES, and have workers in worse than average
health. We show that occupation contributes 41% of the total of Black/White differences in absences,
40% of high-low income differences, and 54% of differences between college graduates and those with at
most a high school diploma.

Introduction
The health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has not been equally felt. Hospitalizations and
deaths are higher for people of color (McLaren 2020) and low income individuals (Baena-Díez et al.
2020). At the same time, no single event since World War II has upended work to the extent of COVID19. In April and May, 24 percent of American workers lost their jobs or income (Despard et al. 2020).
50% of workers now work remotely, limiting their exposure to infection, but potentially creating other
problems, such as isolation and stress (Lyttelton, Zang, and Musick 2020). Essential workers, including
most healthcare, food, manufacturing, and transportation workers continue to go into workplaces.
Research on the risks of indoor transmission (Morawska et al. 2020) and disparate occupational mortality
due to COVID-19 in non-US contexts (O.N.S. 2020) indicates that essential workers are facing a high
level of health risks in workplaces.
Governments and employers have introduced health measures to reduce risks in workplaces,
including mask wearing, social distancing, and enhanced cleaning, but research suggests that this has
often been inadequate. A survey of essential workers in Massachusetts found that many employers
provide inadequate safety gear, that 71% of workers are unable to practice social distancing and 86%
report increased stress (Hammonds, Kerrissey, and Tomaskovic-Devey 2020). In May, 31% of workers
working outside the home reporting CDC-identified COVID-19 symptoms still went in to work (Hart
2020). In meatpacking, CDC estimates that 9% of workers have had COVID-19 (Waltenburg 2020), and
cases spreading from meatpacking plants may have driven regional outbreaks (Richmond et al. 2020).
The experience of work during the pandemic is highly stratified and will likely exacerbate the
existing inequalities in SES and race/ethnicity. Many essential industries disproportionately employ low
wage and non-White workers (Rho, Brown, and Fremstad 2020). Rho, Brown, and Fremstad (2020)
estimate that 41% of frontline workers are non-White, 17% are immigrants, and a third are low income. It
is also likely that low-SES essential workers will have worse morbidity. This is for three reasons. First,
working conditions of low-SES essential jobs are more hazardous than professional essential jobs.
Workers in customer-facing jobs, such as food retail or taxi driving, are exposed to members of the
public. Within the healthcare sector, lower SES workers like nursing aides typically have more patient
contact than higher SES workers, such as doctors. Manufacturing and food processing workers typically
work in open-plan facilities, and so come into contact with many coworkers. Second, low-SES jobs
provide fewer health-related resources. The prevalence and quality of employer-provided healthcare is

lower in low-paying jobs, with implications for quality of care (Rae et al. 2020). Third, low-SES workers
had worse health entering the pandemic, and so occupational exposure may have particularly deleterious
consequences for these workers (Banks et al. 2009).
Many studies have documented COVID-19 health disparities by race/ethnicity or income (BaenaDíez et al. 2020; Golestaneh et al. 2020; McLaren 2020). Examining occupational disparities makes two
additional contributions. First, occupational health disparities are likely acute and consequential in their
own right. Second, given the intersection between work and other dimensions of inequality, work likely
contributes to inequalities by race/ethnicity, income, and education. In this paper, we address four specific
questions: has the rate at which workers are absent from work because of sickness increased during the
pandemic? In what occupations are absences highest? Which occupational characteristics are correlated
with absences? To what extent does occupation contribute to income, educational, and racial/ethnic
disparities in sickness-related absences?
W combine Current Population Survey (CPS) microdata with data on job characteristics obtained
from the ONet, CPS, and the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). Because access to COVID-19 testing
is unequal in the U.S. (Barry-Jester, Hart, and Bluth 2020), we consider all sickness absences during the
pandemic, regardless of whether they are directly due to COVID-19, or for other health-related reasons.
We focus on examining workers only in locations with COVID-19 outbreaks and occupation-level
changes in absence rates since the start of the pandemic. After identifying occupations with particularly
high health risks, we further examine the job characteristics associated with these occupations. Finally,
we quantify how much occupations contribute to observed differences in sickness absences by education,
income, and race/ethnicity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the differential impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic on US workers’ health by occupation, using individual level data.

Data and Measures
The CPS is the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ survey of employment and workers. CPS asks
respondents if they were absent from work because of respondents’ “[o]wn illness/injury/medical
problems”, which we use to construct a binary measure of sickness-related absences. We limit the sample
to respondents aged 25-65 who are employed (i.e. working for an employer or absent due to sickness).
Appendix Table 1 reports summary statistics for all measures.1 We restrict our analyses to state-months

In March – May 2020 BLS misclassified some workers as “absent from work for other reasons” rather than
temporarily laid off (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2020). This should not affect sickness-related absence
estimates, as our sample excludes both unemployed respondents and workers absent from the jobs for reasons other
than sickness, but as a sensitivity check we provide occupational estimates of absences excluding absences that are
followed by an unemployment spell between March and June 2020.

with COVID-19 outbreaks, defined as a death rate above zero. We use state-month data of COVID-19
death rates collected by the New York Times (Healy 2020:20). From this we construct monthly state-level
COVID-19 mortality rates.
The CPS uses the census’ occupational coding schema to classify jobs, harmonized across years.
We also nest these occupations into the 24 major occupational groupings of the Standard Occupational
Classification System. The samples for science-related occupations (N=140) and farming, fishing and
forestry (N=103) in 2020 are too small, so we excluded these observations.
We match the CPS to measures of occupational characteristics. We construct occupational
measures of working conditions, benefits, and demographics using the CPS, the ATUS, and ONet. Using
CPS data from 2017-2020, we calculate the proportion of respondents in a detailed occupation who are
male, Black, Hispanic, immigrant, have a college degree, and report a physical or cognitive difficulty.
Using ASEC from 2014 – 2020, we calculate the proportion of workers with employer-provided health
insurance, mean weekly earnings, and mean self-rated health. The ATUS is a time diary study
administered to a subsample of CPS. In 2017-2018, ATUS included questions on work location and
schedules. We use the proportion of respondents by occupation who are able to work from home to
measure remote work. We use a question on whether workers are able to vary the start and end times that
they work to calculate the proportion of workers with flexible hours.
ONet is a database of occupational characteristics used to study occupational exposures
(Cifuentes et al. 2010). We use a series of measures that could increase risk of COVID-19 exposure.
Disease exposure measures how often a job requires exposure to diseases or infections. Working with
customers measures how important it is to work with external customers Working close to others
measures the extent to which jobs require working in close physical proximity to other people. Working
indoors with environmental controls indicates if workplaces are usually indoors and with environmental
controls such as heat and air-conditioning. Working indoors without environmental controls indicates
indoor working conditions without environmental controls We separate indoor working into two
measures because air conditioning likely increases COVID-19 infections (Lu et al. 2020).
Individual-level controls of SES are from the CPS. We construct measures of race/ethnicity
(Non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic White, and other), educational attainment (High school
diploma or less, some college, college degree or higher), family income category (in $000, 0-40, 40-75,
75-100, 100-150, 150+), and physical or cognitive difficulties. We also include age (and its quadratic),
sex, and unionization as covariates. Because CPS only records union status for two months of eight every

year, to maintain the sample size, unionization is measured using the proportion of workers in a labor
union in a state for each occupation.

Analytical Strategy
To assess if sickness-related absences have increased during the pandemic, we plot sicknessrelated absences in March-June since 2005, comparing state-months that have had at least one COVID-19
death in 2020 to equivalent state-months from earlier years (N = 2,811,676). The federal government
introduced a paid sick leave mandate on April 1 which may confound a comparison of absences
(Andersen et al. 2020). To rule out the potential effect of the mandate, we include a second comparison of
only those areas with existing paid sick leave mandates prior to April 2020, as listed in Table 2 of
Andersen et al.’s (2020) appendix.
To identify which occupations are affected the most, we plot changes in absences since 2017-19
in areas with at least one COVID-19 death by major occupational group. We estimate the changes in
absences by fitting a logit model regressing absences on major occupational group and year, with controls
for age, age squared, and gender, and plot marginal effects (N = 579,613). In addition, we plot levels of
sickness-related absences in areas with a major COVID outbreak, defined as state-months with a death
rate in the upper quartile, equivalent to monthly deaths per hundred thousand residents of 7.9 (N =
23,400). Limiting the sample to areas with a major COVID outbreak makes it more plausible that the
differential levels of absences are driven by the pandemic.
To examine which job characteristics explain occupational differences, we present age-adjusted
partial correlations between occupation-level changes in absence rates and occupational characteristics in
areas that have had at least one COVID death. For these analyses we used census detailed occupational
categories. Because sickness-related absences are relatively rare, we only include occupations with a
sample of 200 or more, which still cover 92% of workers in our full sample for CPS March – June 2020
(N = 538,785).
Finally, we examine the extent to which occupations contribute to educational, racial/ethnic, and
family income differences in sickness-related absences in areas with a major COVID outbreak. First, for
income, educational attainment, and race/ethnicity, we estimate two logit models for absences and plot
predicted probabilities. In the initial model we adjust for age and its quadratic, sex, physical or cognitive
difficulties, state-month-level death rate, unionization levels, and, for the income models, family size. We
include state-level death rate to ensure that our occupational associations are not confounded by some
jobs being incidentally more prevalent in areas with many COVID-19 cases. We control for unionization
because union contracts make it easier for workers to take absences without fear of reprisal, so unionized

workers may have higher levels of absences without having worse health. In the second model, we add
major occupational group. Because respondents in the “Other” race/ethnicity category are highly
heterogenous by race and ethnicity, we do not include them in our race/ethnicity analyses. To quantify the
reduction in income, educational, and racial/ethnic disparities in sickness-related absences accounting for
occupation, we further conduct KHB decompositions (Breen, Karlson, and Holm 2018). All analyses are
weighted using CPS monthly person weights, and standard errors are clustered at the individual level.

Results
Sickness Absences and Work
We observe an unprecedented increase in sickness-related absences in March – June 2020, as
shown in Figure 1. In 2020, absences have jumped to 1.05 in 100 workers, an increase of 72%. The
increase in absences is similar in areas with and without pre-existing paid sick leave mandates.
[FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE]
Figure 2 shows that the distribution of health impact of the pandemic is very unequal across
occupations. Panel A plots sickness-related absences by occupations in high-COVID areas, while Panel B
plots the change in absences from 2017-2019 to 2020 by occupations. The two panels tell a consistent
story, with a similar set of occupations seeing the largest increases in absences and the highest rates of
absence. Transportation, food-related, and personal-care and service occupations have both the highest
rates and largest increases. These occupations saw increases in absences equivalent to 1% of their
workforces, while transportation and food-related occupations saw absence rates of over 3% of. Within
these groups, three occupations have seen particularly stark increases: butchers/meat processing workers,
bartenders, and taxi-drivers saw increases in absences of over 5% of workers. This is consistent with
reporting of COVID-19 outbreaks in meat processing facilities (Waltenburg 2020), while bartenders and
taxi-drivers come into close contact with customers in cramped environs. Professional and managerial
occupations, in contrast, have low rates of absences and have seen little increase over previous years.
Notably, these groups comprise many of the occupations for which transition to remote work is possible.
Thus, there are work-related health inequalities during the pandemic. In high-COVID areas, food and
transportation workers have been six times more likely to report sick than managerial and all professional
occupations, with the exception of healthcare workers.
[FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE]
What characteristics make occupations more dangerous? Table 1 presents age-adjusted
correlations between work environments, material benefits, and worker characteristics and occupation-

level changes in sickness-related absences. Three aspects of work environments are substantially
correlated with change in absences: remote work (R. = -0.28), flexible work hours (R. = -0.24), and
physical proximity (R. = 0.22). Thus, absences have increased in occupations in which workers are unable
to avoid workplaces and working close to other people, and cannot shift their schedules as a strategy to
avoid physical proximity to others. Disease exposure, working with customers, and working indoors are
only weakly correlated with changes in absence rates. Material benefits are strongly correlated with
change in absences, with absences higher in worse paying (R. = -0.33) jobs with less health insurance
coverage (R. = -0.30) seeing larger increases in absences. Table 1 also points to the disparate impact of
worsening occupational health during COVID-19. Increases in absences are larger in occupations in
which workers have pre-existing chronic conditions (R. = 0.14), or poor health (R. = -0.32), in Black-,
Hispanic-, and Immigrant-dominated occupations (R. = 0.35, 0.24, 0.29), and in occupations with fewer
college-educated workers (R. = -0.29). Disparate absences by occupations may in part be a consequence
of pre-existing population differences in health between workers in those occupations, along with their
unequal access to healthcare and related resources. But it is also likely that the concentration of nonWhite and low-SES workers in occupations seeing the worst health outcomes during the pandemic is
differentially exposing those workers to COVID-19 and other health risks.

[TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE]
The Contribution of Occupation to Income, Educational and Racial/Ethnic Inequalities in Absences
To examine how important occupation is in explaining the race/ethnicity and SES disparities in
the health impact of the pandemic among individuals who are still employed, Figure 3 plots disparities in
sickness-related absences in high-COVID areas by race/ethnicity, education, and family income, with and
without adjusting for major occupational groupings. In each case, there are large disparities in absences
that are substantially reduced by accounting for occupation. For workers with a high school diploma or
less, predicted baseline sickness-related absences are 1.9 absences per 100 workers, while collegeeducated workers, the equivalent figure is 0.9 absences. Table 2, which quantifies the portion of the gap
in absences contributed by occupation, shows that major occupational group contributes 53.9% of the
college/high school or less gap, and 44.2% of the college/some college gap.
[FIGURE 3 AND TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE]
Baseline differences in absences are even larger by income. The estimated absence rates are 2.5
absences per 100 workers for the lowest income workers (<$40,000) whereas the corresponding figure is

0.7 absence for those with the highest income ($150,000+). The contribution of occupation to these gaps
is again large, with occupations explaining 40.2% of the gap between the lowest and highest income
workers. White workers have the lowest rates of sickness-related absence, with just over 1 person per 100
workers absent. The corresponding numbers are 1.5 absences and 2 absences for Hispanics and Blacks.
Occupation contributes 41.4% of the Black-White gap and 65.8% of the White-Hispanic gap.

Conclusion
We find that there was a substantial increase in sickness-related absences in areas with a COVID19 outbreak in March – June 2020, with very large disparities across occupations. Over 3% of food and
transportation workers were absent from work due to illness during this period, a rate six times higher
than that for most professional occupations. Increases in absences are associated with both working
conditions and material benefits. They are positively correlated with working in close physical proximity
to others and negatively correlated with the ability to work remotely, flexible work hours, earnings, and
health insurance coverage. Our findings highlight the urgency of addressing workplace safety and
providing adequate healthcare to workers during the pandemic.
We find that less educated, low income and non-White Americans are exposed to the worst health
risks at work. Disproportionately Black occupations have seen particularly large increases in absences
during the pandemic compared to previous years, as have occupations that pay less and with few collegeeducated workers. Major occupational group contributes 41% of the total of Black/White differences in
absences, 40% of high-low income differences, and 54% of differences between college graduates and
those with at most a high school diploma. The findings presented above suggest that differences in the
experience of work during the pandemic is both itself an important dimension of SES disparities in
COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, and a contributor to income, educational, and race/ethnic health
inequalities.
To ameliorate these disparities, employers and governments should urgently address workplace
preventative health measures. The Centers for Disease Control provides guidelines for safe workplaces,
including mask wearing, social distancing, and ventilation. However, reporting on COVID-19 outbreaks
in the meatpacking industry makes clear that local government health authorities have neither the capacity
nor the authority to enforce workplace safety measures (Grabell, Perlman, and Yeung 2020). The
recession caused by the pandemic has led to severe budgetary shortfalls for state and local governments,
likely further taxing the resources of local health departments. Funding such entities to create a

functioning system of workplace health and safety enforcement should be a priority of federal and state
governments.
