Abstract:
Previous research has shown that gender role attitudes can predict changes in couples’
housework division over critical life events, but these studies might have suffered from
endogeneity because the occurrence of such life events is anticipated and may be affected by
gender role attitudes. In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic was a truly exogenous shock that
hit couples unexpectedly. This study examines the role of gender ideologies in how couples
adjusted their division of housework during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 compared to a
pre-pandemic baseline observation. The data cover 3,219 couples from the UK Household
Longitudinal Study, with a baseline wave and four COVID-19 panel waves between April and
September 2020. We found no evidence that individuals’ or couples’ pre-crisis gender role
attitudes affected changes in men's and women's absolute or relative contributions to housework
at any time during the lockdown. However, both partners spent substantially more time on
housework throughout the COVID-19 crisis than before, especially in the early stages, and in
relative terms, the pandemic seems to have contributed to at least a temporary, modest increase
in gender equality in housework. We discuss our results against the background of previous
research whose results may have suffered from endogeneity problems and argue that the
COVID-19 ‘shock’ was likely perceived as a merely temporary disruption of couples'
established housework arrangements.

Introduction

The gendered division of labour is embedded in a broader system of gender inequality and is
thus more than just a family affair (e.g., Fuwa 2004). Importantly, despite some indication of
convergence at older ages, the division of housework in couples remains highly gendered
throughout the life course (e.g., Leopold et al. 2018). A growing body of research indicates,
however, that critical life events are often accompanied by subsequent adaptations of couples’
division of domestic work: Principal examples are family-related events, such as the transition
to marriage or parenthood (e.g., Baxter et al. 2008; Kühhirt 2012; Schober 2013a), as well as
employment-related events, such as transitions to full-time work (e.g., Gershuny et al. 2005;
Schober 2013b), unemployment (e.g., Fauser 2019; van der Lippe et al. 2018), or retirement
(Leopold & Skopek 2018; Szinovacs 2000). Studies provide robust evidence that changes in
partners’ relative resources and time availability cannot fully account for the observed
adaptations in the division of household labour. Rather, and in line with gender construction
theories (e.g., Geist & Ruppaner 2018), it has been suggested that partners’ gender role attitudes
are central to any explanation. Gender role attitudes (or, synonymously, gender ideologies) are
“beliefs about the appropriate role activities for women and men” in various life spheres, such
as work, family, or politics (McHugh & Frieze 1997: 4).
Gender ideologies are, however, to some extent endogenous to the previously studied
events: Holding more traditional attitudes is, for example, likely to affect the risk of
unemployment and the timing of retirement (through its effect on male and female partners’
labour force participation; e.g., Uunk & Lersch 2019), and (dis)similarities in gender role
attitudes have been shown to affect couples’ fertility (e.g., Hudde & Engelhardt 2020). To avoid
possible bias due to such endogeneity, assessments of gender ideologies’ role in adaptations of
couples’ division of housework following critical life events should ideally draw on truly
exogenous shocks – such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

The COVID-19 crisis of 2020 hit families unexpectedly. A key concern in debates about
the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic is its potential impact on gender inequalities (e.g.,
Alon et al. 2020; Oreffice & Quintana-Domeque 2020). Some commentators have suggested
that the virological pandemic might have triggered a ‘patriarchal pandemic’ (Chemaly, 2020),
disproportionally forcing women out of the labour market (e.g., Andrew et al. 2020; Reichelt
et al. 2020) and back into traditional homemaker roles. This would not only bring to a halt
recent macro-level trends of convergence in male and female partners’ time spent on housework
(e.g., Leopold et al. 2018; Pailhé et al. 2021) but can also be perceived as an unanticipated
shock at the micro-level of couple relationships, forcing partners to renegotiate everyday
routines, including their division of domestic labour.
The present study aims to deepen our understanding of such processes by investigating
whether and how pre-crisis gender role attitudes affected couples’ reaction to the consequences
of lockdowns and school closures. Our focus is on attitudes towards the gendered organization
of family life (here, the division of housework) because these attitudes and the agreement on
the division of partners’ tasks and responsibilities are directly related to the internal functioning
of the relationship and family (Kalmijn 2005). We employ unique data from the UK Household
Longitudinal Study and four waves of its COVID-19 panel survey (see Burton et al. 2020),
allowing us to monitor couples’ adaptation from April through September 2020.

COVID-19, couples’ division of housework, and gender role attitudes

Research on changes in couples’ division of labour early in the COVID-19 crisis indicates that
the amount of unpaid domestic and care work has increased for both women and men, but the
relevant studies provide ambiguous evidence regarding changes in the gender gap across a
range of European countries (e.g., Del Boca et al. 2020; Fodor et al. 2021; Hank & Steinbach
2021; Hipp & Bünning 2021). Evidence from the United Kingdom consistently shows that, on
average, women have made substantially larger contributions to additional childcare demands
3

and housework than men (see Andrew et al. 2020; Sevilla & Smith 2020; Xue & McMunn
2020; Zamberlan et al. 2021). Importantly, gender differences in the allocation of domestic
work cannot be fully explained by gender differences in employment or earnings (Andrew et
al. 2020; Zamberlan et al. 2021), and the additional hours of childcare done by women are less
sensitive to their employment than are men’s (Sevilla & Smith 2020; also see Xue & McMunn
2020). 1
To explain these dynamics in couples’ division of domestic duties during the COVID-19
pandemic, two primary pathways related to changes in partners’ time availability and additional
housework demands have been discussed so far (see, for example, Hank & Steinbach 2021).
First, during the COVID-19 crisis, changes in employment affected partners’ availability in the
household. During the early phase of the pandemic, employment decreased considerably, and
women were more likely than men to reduce their working hours or lose their jobs (e.g., Andrew
et al. 2020; Reichelt et al. 2021; see, in contrast, Christoph et al. 2021). Whereas unemployment
or reductions in working hours have been shown to be associated with overall increases in
housework time, there are important gender differences in couples’ adjustment to reduced or
terminated employment (e.g., Fauser 2019; Pailhé et al. 2019; van der Lippe et al. 2018): Task
specialization by gender becomes more pronounced, and the extra domestic work is
substantially greater for unemployed women than for unemployed men. This has been proposed
as a likely driver of increases in women’s share of household labour during the COVID-19
pandemic (e.g., Zamberlan et al. 2021). In parallel, however, for many of those who remained
in employment, working conditions changed substantially. Working from home, for example,
has become more common (e.g., Felstead & Reuschke 2020). For men working from home,
previously invisible childcare and housework may have become more noticeable, and they may

19 pandemic, see, for example, Crompton et al. (2005) and McMunn et al. (2020).

have become more involved in these tasks if their work area is shared with other family
members and used for other purposes, e.g., as the dining table, or is located next to the children’s
play space. Hence, for men in particular, this situation creates new opportunities and demands
to increase their contribution to managing the household (e.g., Stenpaß & Kley 2020).
Second, under lockdown, the amount of housework may have changed. People not only
spent more time at home but also spent more time doing housework (e.g., Oreffice & QuintanaDomeque 2020). At the same time, opportunities for domestic outsourcing – such as dining out
or hiring household help – decreased. This is a likely driver of disproportionate increases in
female partners’ time devoted to household labour, as women have been shown to be the main
beneficiaries of domestic outsourcing (e.g., Craig et al. 2016; Raz-Yurovich & Marx 2019).
Moreover, if mothers carry the main burden of new or resumed responsibilities resulting from
closures of childcare facilities and schools (e.g., Benzeval et al. 2020; Zoch et al. 2021), one
may expect spill-over effects on other tasks at home as well.
A third process of adaptation, which – to the best of our knowledge – has not yet been
explicitly investigated in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, relates to gender role attitudes.
This gap in previous research seems unfortunate because gender differences in the allocation of
domestic work under lockdown cannot be fully explained by gender differences in employment
rates or earnings (e.g., Andrew et al. 2020; Zamberlan et al. 2021). We argue that gender role
attitudes predict how couples adjusted to the COVID-19 shock and the associated increased
work demands in the household.
Individuals with less egalitarian attitudes favour ‘separate spheres,’ where women’s
responsibilities revolve around the private realm, family, and homemaking, as opposed to men’s
responsibilities, which are mainly in the labour market and public sphere. Individuals with more
egalitarian attitudes ascribe to the idea of ‘joint spheres,’ in which women and men are equally
involved in tasks in all spheres, such as family, housework, and the labour market (see Davis
& Greenstein 2009). Consequently, those with more egalitarian attitudes should favour equal
5

involvement of women and men in housework, whereas those with less egalitarian attitudes
should favour a setting where women perform the lion’s share of housework.
According to cognitive dissonance theory, individuals aim to organize their family life in
accordance with their own attitudes (Festinger 1962), and Davis & Greenstein (2009) conclude
from their review that most studies indeed find that men’s and women’s gender role attitudes
are in line with the proportion of housework they actually perform. For example, husbands
and/or wives exhibiting egalitarian gender role attitudes were found to be more likely to share
housework equally (Aassve et al. 2014). Moreover, longitudinal studies investigating changes
in the division of housework after, for example, childbirth showed that egalitarian gender
attitudes before motherhood reduced the shift towards a more traditional division of paid and
domestic work after the transition to parenthood (e.g., Nitsche & Grunow 2016; Schober 2013).
Even in these longitudinal studies, however, endogeneity cannot be ruled out completely if prebirth gender role attitudes, childbirth, and adaptation of the sharing of housework are
interrelated. In contrast to the first COVID-19 lockdown, parenthood is an event in anticipation
of which couples will usually develop expectations about their subsequent division of labour
(e.g., Dechant & Rinklake 2016). The lockdown, however, hit individuals and couples
unexpectedly, that is, without much time to develop new housework division arrangements
consistent with their gender role attitudes. Hence, given the unforeseen nature of the COVID19 crisis and the concomitant changes within households, it offers a unique opportunity to study
gender role attitudes’ effect on changes in couples’ division of domestic work.
Our first set of hypotheses derived from the above considerations refers to the expectation
that gender role attitudes predict changes in housework from baseline to COVID-19; that is, we
expect attitudes to moderate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on housework. At the
individual level, men with egalitarian attitudes are expected to increase their housework more
than men with traditional attitudes, whereas the opposite is expected for women. These changes
in housework are expected to occur independent of the partner’s gender role attitudes. At the
6

couple level, we expect an interaction between the partners: If both partners express egalitarian
attitudes, the division of housework will be more equal than in traditional couples or in those
with divergent attitudes.
Our second set of hypotheses refers to changes over time during our observation period,
that is, from the early phase of the first lockdown in April through its later phase in September.
Specifically, we expect further adaptations in the division of housework depending on partners’
gender role attitudes. In the unanticipated early phase of the lockdown, couples’ reaction to the
new situation might have been driven by gender role attitudes as well as by immediate and
pragmatic decisions related to the partner’s time availability and the additional demands of
housework. During the summer, however, couples may have revised their initial ‘pragmatic’
arrangements to (re-)align with their pre-crisis gender role attitudes. Hence, we expect gender
role attitudes to be a stronger predictor of couples’ division of housework in September than in
April.

Data, variables and methods

3.1

Data and Sample

Data. We analyse data from Understanding Society: The UK Household Longitudinal Study
(Platt et al. 2020; also see Burton et al. 2020). Specifically, we use Wave 10 of the
Understanding Society’s main survey conducted in 2018-19 (University of Essex 2020) 2 as well
as four COVID-19 study waves conducted in April, May, June, and September 2020 (University
of Essex 2021). The latter study was initiated as a high-frequency panel on people’s experiences
and reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic (Institute for Social and Economic Research 2021).
Eligible were all Understanding Society respondents who had participated in at least one of the

al. 2021).

previous two waves of the main survey. The first wave of the COVID-19 study was carried out
in April 2020, with monthly waves until July and bi-monthly surveys from September 2020
onwards.
Survey timing in the pandemic context. Figure 1 puts the timing of the survey interviews
into the context of the first pandemic wave. It plots the fieldwork periods of the survey waves
against two proxies for pandemic activity and lockdown intensity, namely, the number of
COVID-19 patients who were in hospitals and a measure of people’s mobility patterns. Any
effective lockdown measure will reduce people’s mobility and increase their time spent at
home. Therefore, we use aggregate information on the change in time spent in any residential
area from the Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports as a proxy for the position on
the lockdown-normality continuum (Google LLC 2020; Hudde & Nitsche 2020). Both
measures show that the country was most severely affected in early and mid-April, shortly
before the interviews for the first COVID-19 survey wave were conducted. Towards the
summer, hospitalizations neared zero, and the lockdown became moderately less intense. The
fieldwork period for the September interviews roughly marks the end of the period with low
hospitalizations and moderate-low lockdown intensity and the beginning of the second major
infection wave. In summary, the April wave roughly captures the period of maximum pandemic
impact; the May and June waves cover periods of relatively high but declining impact, and the
September wave captures the temporary recovery to a relatively normal situation.

Survey methods and weights. Beginning in the Understanding Society study’s Wave 8,
face-to-face in-home interviewing was gradually replaced by web interviews (Burton et al.
2020). In Wave 10, 70% of respondents were invited to participate via the web, and the other
30% were invited to participate face-to-face. These 30% consisted of a random sample (20% of
the total) and households that were predicted to have the lowest probability of participating
online (10% of the total). Telephone interviews were conducted with those who could not be
reached via the web or in person. Among the completed interviews in Wave 10, 59% were
realized via the web, 41% face-to-face, and less than 1% via telephone. For the COVID-19
study, the interview mode shifted almost entirely to online (Burton et al. 2020). Understanding
Society has a complex design, and the data providers strongly suggest using weights (Institute
for Social and Economic Research 2020). In the Understanding Society sample, some groups,
such as people from Northern Ireland and ethnic minorities, are over-represented by design,
and some groups are more likely to respond than others. Using weights assures that we average
9

within-person changes over a representative population. We therefore apply the longitudinal
weight provided for the most recently available wave to all analyses (Institute for Social and
Economic Research 2021).
Sample selection. Our sample consists of opposite-sex couples where both partners
participated in Wave 10 of the Understanding Society study and in at least one out of the four
COVID-19 waves featuring the question on housework. Wave 10 (‘baseline’) includes 9,243
opposite-sex couples, corresponding to 18,486 individuals. Of these, 10,833 individuals
participated in at least one of the COVID-19 waves (58.6%); there were 4,097 couples where
both partners participated (8,194 individuals). On average, these couples participated in 4.1 out
of the five analysed waves.
There are relatively few missing values for our key variables: Missing information on
attitudes occurred in 4.4% of couples, missing information on housework in 4.2%, and missing
work hours in 1.6%. In total, the attrition due to missing data is 9.9% and therefore relatively
low. Further, 31 couples were dropped because their Wave 10 interview was conducted after
the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, that is, in March or April 2020. After dropping those
with a survey weight of zero (14.4%), this leaves us with an analytical sample of 3,219 couples,
observed for an average of 3.9 waves (12,702 couple-observations, 25,404 personobservations).

3.2

Measures

Partners’ engagement in housework is measured as weekly hours spent on housework, such as
“cooking, cleaning and doing the laundry”. In the main study (Wave 10), respondents were
asked “About how many hours do you spend on housework in an average week, such as time
spent cooking, cleaning and doing the laundry?”. In the COVID-19 study, housework
engagement was covered in Waves 1, 2, 3, and 5, that is, in April, May, June, and September.
In contrast to the main study, in the COVID-19 study, housework was measured with reference
10

to the “last week” preceding the interview. The measure of the share of the couple’s housework
is calculated as own housework hours divided by the sum of one’s own and one’s partner’s
hours.
We use Understanding Society’s Wave 10 for pre-COVID-19 information on gender role
attitudes as a ‘baseline’ measure. For our analysis, accounting for pre-crisis attitudes is
necessary to avoid endogeneity resulting from possible feedback of changes in couples’ division
of labour on partners’ gender ideologies at the time of the COVID-19 interviews (Carlson &
Lynch 2013; also see Nitsche & Grunow 2016). Our measure of gender role attitudes is derived
from iterated principal factor analysis over four items that have also been used in previous
studies on the division of housework (e.g., Fuwa 2004; Okun & Raz‐Yurovich 2019; Schober
2013; measured with 5-point scales ranging from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree”),
namely:
1. A husband's job is to earn money, a wife's job is to look after the home and family.
2. Both the husband and wife should contribute to the household income.
3. All in all, family life suffers when the woman has a full-time job.
4. A pre-school child is likely to suffer if his or her mother works.
All four items capture attitudes towards the gendered nexus between work and
family/homemaking; that is, they all focus on a similar aspect or dimension of gender role
attitudes (for discussions of different dimensions of gender role attitudes, see, for example,
Grunow et al. 2018; Hudde, 2018). In particular, these items focus on women’s roles as mothers,
whether they should work for pay and whether working moms have a negative effect on family
life. The first item explicitly mentions “to look after the home”, i.e., to perform housework. A
Cronbach’s Alpha of 0.72 gives statistical support to the idea that these four items capture one
latent, underlying factor. To isolate this factor, we used iterated principal factor analysis with
promax rotation. The factor variable is coded such that higher values represent more egalitarian
gender role attitudes.
11

Finally, we control for changes in both partners’ working hours because they affect
partners’ time availability and might thus confound the association between attitudes and the
division of housework.

Methods

For the descriptive analysis, we split the total sample by gender and gender role attitudes. For
this purpose, we dichotomize our continuous measure of gender role attitudes, labelling
attitudes below the gender-specific median as ‘less egalitarian’ and those above the median as
‘more egalitarian’. We then compute and plot the average hours of housework and the men’s
average housework share by women’s and men’s attitudes. Confidence intervals are computed
using pooled ordinary least squares regression with standard errors clustered at the
individual/couple level. For the multivariate analysis and to study the effect of gender role
attitudes on short-term changes in housework hours, we run linear panel regression models
using fixed effects at the individual/couple level. This method analyses changes in housework
within individuals/couples over time.
12

Our hypotheses state that gender role attitudes predict how housework changes in
response to the COVID-19 crisis; that is, attitudes moderate the effect of the pandemic on
housework. To operationalize these hypotheses, the regression models include dummy
variables for each monthly wave (that is, the average change in housework between the baseline
and each COVID-19 wave) and the interaction terms between these dummy variables and the
respondents’ attitude (that is, the test of whether the degree of change is a function of
respondents’ pre-crisis attitude). The monthly dummies capture the degree to which the
COVID-19 pandemic affected people’s lives: The ‘April’ dummy, for example, captures the
period of the pandemic with the most intense lockdown, whereas ‘September’ captures the
recovery to a near-normal situation (see Figure 1).

4.

Results

First, we look at partners’ absolute hours of housework (Section 4.1) and then study the division
of housework within couples (Section 4.2). From both angles, we examine our hypotheses that
gender role attitudes predict the change in housework from baseline to COVID-19.

4.1

Gender role attitudes and housework hours of men and women: the individual

perspective
By comparing the housework hours of women and men (Figure 2; Panels A and B), we see that
women, particularly those with less egalitarian attitudes, spent approximately twice as many
hours on housework at any point in time. Men with less egalitarian attitudes engage least in
domestic work. Hence, when looking at the overall level, we replicate the well-known
associations among gender, gender role attitudes, and housework.
Figure 2 (Panels C and D) also illustrates the change in housework hours for women and
men during lockdown compared to the baseline measure. These results align with previous
studies showing that men and women spent more hours doing housework during the crisis than
13

in the pre-crisis period. This trend in housework roughly follows the course of the pandemic:
housework is highest in April and May, when infection cases are also at their highest and the
lockdown is at its most intense; in summer, when infection cases are low and the lockdown
intensity is moderate, housework returns relatively close to baseline.

nindividuals = 3, 219; nobservations = 12,702; men: nindividuals = 3, 219; nobservations = 12,702). Attitude groups are divided
by the gender-specific median, i.e., “less egalitarian” refers to the less egalitarian half of the gender-specific
sample. “Baseline” refers to Wave 10 of Understanding Society.

The pattern of change in housework from baseline to COVID-19 is similar between
genders and attitude groups. Compared to the average number of hours they spent on housework
14

before the COVID-19 crisis, women spent approximately two and a half more hours and men
almost three more hours on housework in April/May. In September, women still spent
approximately 50 minutes more on housework than at baseline, and men devoted 75 minutes
more to housework. In contrast to our expectations, these changes in housework hours do not
differ by individuals’ pre-crisis gender role attitudes: Whereas the respective time spent on
housework in groups with ‘more’/‘less’ egalitarian attitudes differs at baseline, there is little
difference in their response to the unforeseen COVID 19 crisis.
Figure 3 illustrates the effect of gender role attitudes on housework based on fixed-effects
regression models controlling for one’s own and one’s partner’s working hours (see Panels A
and B; full results are presented in Table A1 in the Appendix). None of the effects reach
statistical significance. In tendency, however, women with more egalitarian attitudes reported
smaller changes in housework hours, whereas men with more egalitarian attitudes increased
their time spent on housework. The confidence intervals are not large, so the insignificance of
the coefficients is unlikely to be due to our sample size or a lack of overall change in housework
hours. What we observe instead is that, irrespective of their lack of statistical significance, the
estimated ‘effects’ are substantively small (on the order of a 20-minute – or even smaller –
change in housework predicted by a one-standard-deviation change in gender role attitudes).
Further, our expectation was that attitudes matter more in the latter than in the first months of
the pandemic, but there is no evidence that attitudes matter at any point in time.

4.2 Gender role attitudes and partners’ share in housework: the couple perspective
In the previous section, we discussed individuals’ absolute time spent doing housework. We
now consider the couple’s division of housework, that is, men’s share of housework, by
couples’ gender role attitude constellations, namely, both partners express less egalitarian
gender role attitudes (‘traditional’ couples), both partners hold more egalitarian attitudes
(‘egalitarian’ couples), and two combinations of mixed gender role attitudes.
Figure 4 (Panel A) shows that at baseline, men’s share of couples’ housework is highest
in egalitarian couples (38 percent) and lowest in traditional couples (28 percent). Moreover,
men’s attitudes seem to matter more than women’s, as partners’ shares of housework are more
equally distributed in couples with egalitarian attitudes in men rather than women. Panel B
highlights the change in men’s share of housework compared to the pre-crisis situation by the
four different constellations of attitudes. In all couples, men’s share increased significantly (by
more than three percentage points on average) in the intense early lockdown phase. Hence, in
relative terms, the pandemic increased gender equality in housework in all couple
constellations.

Fig 4: Descriptive findings on gender role attitudes and men’s share of the couple’s housework (ncouples = 3, 219;
nobservations = 12,702). Attitude groups are divided by the gender-specific median, i.e., “woman less, man more
egalitarian” refers to a couple where the woman comes from the less egalitarian half of women and the man from
the more egalitarian half of men. “Baseline” refers to Wave 10 of Understanding Society.

On average, the pandemic had a positive effect on men’s share of housework: At the peak
of the first lockdown phase, men increased their share of housework by approximately three
percentage points. By September, men’s housework share decreased to a level slightly above
the pre-crisis baseline. Concerning our research question, there is no clear association between
attitude constellation and change in the division of housework. Our theoretical expectation was
that men’s share would increase most in couples where both are more egalitarian and least in
couples where both are less egalitarian. However, this pattern does not materialize, and
17

trajectories are almost identical in both types of homogamous couples and in couples where the
woman is egalitarian and the man is not. The couples in which the man is egalitarian and the
woman is not seems to deviate: in these couples, men’s share remains substantially above
baseline. However, the confidence interval is rather broad, so this finding should be interpreted
with caution.

Fig 5: Effect of egalitarian attitudes on the change in men’s share of the couple’s housework compared to baseline
(results from fixed-effects regression models, see Table A2; ncouples = 3, 219; nobservations = 12,702). “Baseline” refers
to Wave 10 of Understanding Society.

Figure 5 illustrates the effect of gender role attitudes on housework based on fixed-effects
regression models controlling for both partners’ working hours (full results are presented in
Table A2 in the Appendix). The results show that there is no systematic effect of women’s or
men’s attitudes at any month during the pandemic. The degree to which men change their share
of the couples’ housework in response to the crisis is therefore independent of women’s
attitudes (Panel A in Figure 5), men’s attitudes (Panel B), or their interaction (Table A2 in the
Appendix).
Similar as for individual housework, irrespective of their lack of statistical significance,
the point estimates are small in substantive terms (less than a 1%-point change in men’s
18

housework share predicted by a one-standard-deviation change in their gender role attitudes).
That is, even if we cannot be certain whether there is a small effect or no effect, there is certainly
no large effect of gender role attitudes on the hours spent on and share of housework during the
COVID-19 crisis. In sum, we find no support for our first or second hypotheses.

4.3 Robustness checks and further analyses
To challenge these null findings, we conducted additional analyses. First, our main regression
models included the attitudes as linear terms. This means that any non-linear relationship in the
data might be overlooked. We therefore examined the associations using local linear smoothing,
which allows for a flexible pattern of association (see Figures A1-A4 in the Appendix). This
approach confirmed that there is no substantial association of any shape. Second, the dependent
housework variables have a number of outliers, which might excessively impact the results. As
a further test, we therefore recoded outliers. In these tests, the estimates remained almost
identical (see Figures A5-A6 in the Appendix). In sum, the results of these further analyses
underscore the conclusion that gender role attitudes do not predict how people’s engagement in
housework changed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Summary and conclusions

The present study set out to investigate the role of gender role attitudes in the dynamics of
couples’ division of housework in a very peculiar historical context: The COVID-19 lockdown
of 2020. Data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study and four waves of its COVID-19
panel survey provided us with the opportunity to investigate couples’ adaptation to changing
circumstances following a truly exogenous shock, thereby avoiding issues of potential
endogeneity common in related previous research. Our study thus contributes not only to the
growing literature on gender inequalities during the pandemic (e.g., Alon et al. 2020; Oreffice

19

& Quintana-Domeque 2020) but also – and more generally – to a better understanding of how
couples negotiate their division of labour (e.g., Geist & Ruppaner 2018).
The main starting point for our research was observations indicating that changes in
partners’ relative resources and time availability cannot fully account for adaptations in the
division of household labour following critical life events more generally, ranging from
childbirth to retirement (e.g., Leopold & Skopek 2018; Schober 2013a), and the ‘COVID-19
shock’ in particular (e.g., Andrew et al. 2020; Zamberlan et al. 2021). We therefore
hypothesized, first, that pre-crisis gender role attitudes predict changes in housework from our
pre-COVID-19 baseline observation to lockdown (that is, the period from April through
September 2020). Second, we expected gender role attitudes to be stronger predictors of
couples’ division of housework in September than in April 2020, as couples may then have
revised their pragmatic adaptations to the early and more intense lockdown in spring by
arrangements more in line with their pre-crisis attitudes.
Neither of these hypotheses could be supported by the results of our empirical analyses:
We found no evidence indicating that individuals’ or couples’ pre-crisis gender role attitudes
affected changes in men’s or women’s absolute or relative contributions to housework at any
time during lockdown. These null findings were confirmed by a series of robustness checks.
However, both partners spent substantially more time on housework throughout the COVID19 crisis than before, especially in its early phase, and in relative terms, the pandemic seems to
have contributed to an at least temporary, modest increase in gender equality in housework.
Against the background of fears of a ‘patriarchal pandemic’, this latter finding is good
news. One should be careful, however, about drawing premature general conclusions regarding
gender inequalities during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. One particular reason
warranting such caution is the lack of consideration of another important component in couples’
division of labour in our analysis, namely, childcare. Other UK studies suggest that mothers,
on average, provided substantially more additional hours of childcare than fathers but that there
20

is also an important fraction of fathers who became substantially more involved in childcare
during the COVID-19 crisis (e.g., Hupkau & Petrolongo 2020; Sevilla & Smith 2020; see
Kreyenfeld & Zinn, 2021, for corresponding evidence from Germany). Overall, pre-crisis
gender inequalities in couples’ division of labour within the household do not seem to have
undergone major changes –in the UK or elsewhere in Europe (e.g., Hank & Steinbach 2021;
Zamberlan et al. 2021).
An important question remains regarding why our expectation that gender role attitudes
would matter for couples’ adaptation to the novel situation during the initial COVID-19
lockdown was not confirmed by our empirical findings. Though we cannot provide a definitive
answer, we propose two possible explanations. First, previous research claiming an impact of
gender role attitudes on changes in the division of housework after major life course events may
have suffered from potential endogeneity issues. Attitudes and behaviour are engaged in
constant feedback: attitudes influence behaviour, and behaviour influences attitudes. In fact,
there may also be a feedback loop between attitudes and anticipated behaviour. For example, a
woman planning to have a child may anticipate that motherhood will lead to reduced
employment and increased housework, and she may adapt her attitudes to this anticipated
change to avoid cognitive dissonance (Festinger, 1962). The truly exogenous shock of the
pandemic created a unique opportunity to rule out such potential issues of endogeneity. From
this perspective, previous studies might have overestimated the actual role of gender ideologies.
Second, it could be that gender role attitudes matter under certain circumstances but not
under the specific circumstances of the unanticipated COVID-19 shock. There are at least two
plausible relevant ways in which the COVID-19 shock may differ from life events, for which
gender role attitudes matter. First, unlike these life events, the pandemic was unanticipated,
with the consequence that people were not able to mentally prepare and develop a behavioural
script that was in accordance with their attitudes. What speaks against this idea is that attitudes
should be readily available and guide behaviour in a rapid and possibly subconscious way
21

(Ajzen & Fishbein, 2005). If gender role attitudes have little impact on behaviour under
unanticipated circumstances, this would weaken their relevance for family functioning, given
that unexpected shocks are not rare – think, for example, of health crises in the family or
unexpected job changes, such as a sudden increase or decrease in working hours. A second
relevant way in which the pandemic differs from other changes in life circumstances is that
COVID-19 is a temporary shock, one that changes couples’ lives for a few months before things
return to normal (or at least, this is what most people expected to happen during the first
pandemic wave in 2020). People might have expected that any change in housework and the
gender balance would eventually return to the pre-crisis level. In practice, this means that, for
example, a man with traditional gender role attitudes might be willing to increase his
engagement during the pandemic because he is confident that the pandemic will have no longlasting effect and he will be able to return to his practice of doing only a few hours of housework
once the pandemic is over.
Despite its null findings, our study offers several promising avenues for future research.
It will be important to investigate, for example, whether or how individuals’ gender role
attitudes change in the further course and aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis (e.g., Reichelt et
al. 2021), as has been previously observed after other critical life events (such as the transition
to parenthood; Schober & Scott 2012). In particular, a distinction between anticipated and
unforeseen life events accompanied by short-term and long-term adaptions of behaviour might
be a promising avenue for examining the relevance of gender role attitudes to couples’
behaviours and attitude-behaviour feedback loops. Moreover, even though gender role attitudes
did not predict how couples adapted their division of household labour during lockdown, they
might well be relevant to couples’ adaptation to the COVID-19 crisis in other important
domains, such as fertility (e.g., Okun & Raz-Yurovich 2019; Voicu & Bădoi 2021).
