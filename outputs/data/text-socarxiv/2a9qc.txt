This study examines how people with disabilities and chronic health conditions—members of a
large and diverse group often overlooked by Canadian public policy—are making sense of the
Canadian federal government's response to COVID-19. Using original national online survey data
collected in June 2020 (N=1,027), we investigate how members of this group view the
government's overall response. Although survey results show broad support for the federal
government's pandemic response, findings also indicate fractures based on disability type and
specific health condition, political partisanship, region, and experiences with COVID-19. Among
these, identification with the Liberal party and receipt of CERB stand out as associated with more
positive views. Further examination of qualitative responses shows that these views are also linked
to differing perspectives surrounding government benefits and spending, partisan divisions, as well
as other social and cultural cleavages.

Introduction
https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

Canadian policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic are generally thought to have been swifter,
more consistent, more widely-implemented, better informed by health experts, and more cautious
towards recovery than many other countries. Success has been attributed to a centralized rapid
response facilitated by cross-partisan cooperation among federal and provincial leaders (Mignone
2020; see also Howlett and Mignone 2019).

Despite Canada’s early reputation as having successfully responded to the pandemic (Miller 2020;
Roser et al. 2020; Wilson et al 2020), the public’s views of the federal policy response vary across
the country. Along with regional differences, individual experiences with COVID-19 and political
preferences shape perceptions of the pandemic and the government's response to it. These
responses include social distancing policies undertaken to address COVID-19’s spread that ranged
from closures and lockdowns to mask-wearing mandates and public handwashing campaigns.
They also include early and swift income support polices, such as the Canada Emergency Response
Benefit (a.k.a., CERB), meant to address the economic impacts of COVID-19 on the public at
large. With these policies in place, not to mention variation in provincial discourse around the
pandemic response, there was considerable variation in Canadians’ confidence in the federal
government’s handling of the pandemic – from believing the government has not done enough to
believing it has gone too far.

Although regional and partisan differences in support for the government’s response to COVID19 are expected, members of different marginalized groups may also experience and respond to

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

policy differently. This study focuses on the views of people with disabilities and chronic health
conditions – a large marginalized group that already experiences significant employment and
financial barriers, as well as obstacles to accessing social and health services. As the pandemic
unfolded, the disproportionate impacts of the virus and the corresponding social distancing
measures on already vulnerable and economically marginalized groups across Canada became
increasingly apparent. This was especially true for people with different disabilities and chronic
health conditions. The ways social, political, and economic factors affect people with disabilities
and chronic health conditions are made ever more acute in times of crises given that health and
disability status are key determinants of individuals’ experiences and life chances. A diverse
community, it is also likely that policy perceptions vary within and among people with different
disabilities and chronic health conditions.

Based on original data from a national online survey of 1,027 people with disabilities and chronic
health conditions conducted in June 2020, we address several key questions. How do people with
disabilities and chronic health conditions view the federal government's response to COVID-19?
Does support vary by specific disability and condition? Is it connected to experiences with
COVID-19? What other factors does support vary by including partisan preferences and
regionality?

Our results contribute to the evolving understanding of the ways in which public policy responses
to global health pandemics impact already vulnerable populations. We find that people with

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

disabilities and chronic health conditions have been generally supportive of the federal
government's response to COVID-19 with 45% of respondents reporting positive ratings.
However, respondents' perceptions about the virus and about public policy responses also largely
varied by disability type and health status, partisan political preferences, and region, illustrating
that people with disabilities and chronic health conditions, often treated as a single homogenous
group, are diverse in their public policy preferences. Although we expected respondents to view
the pandemic through a lens heavily informed by their experiences with disability and health, and
potentially membership in other status groups, we found that support was much more connected
to larger political views and individual experiences with the virus itself.

We begin with a general discussion of the ways in which pre-existing structural disadvantage is
tied to disability and health status and the potential ways COVID-19 policy responses have
exacerbated extant inequalities. We specifically outline how people with disabilities and chronic
health conditions have been affected by COVID-19 and measures taken to combat its deleterious
effects. We then discuss how extant disadvantage, experiences with COVID, regionality and
partisan political preferences shape public perceptions of federal government pandemic responses.

Extant Inequality and Pandemic Policy Responses

Pandemics are shocks to the system. Although they may generate new forms of disadvantage and
inequality, they often amplify existing structural inequalities. Policy contexts play an important

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

role in determining whether pre-existing levels of inequality will increase during and following
pandemics, shaping how different segments of society experience these crises and post-crisis
recovery. In that vein, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted policy shortcomings (Arcaya et
al. 2020) and revealed the kinds of cumulative vulnerabilities that place certain groups like
disabled people and people with pre-existing chronic health issues in greater social, health, and
economic jeopardy (Olsson 2015; Fothergill and Peek 2015; Hoffman et al. 2020). Social scientists
studying health have long pointed out that pre-existing inequalities based on group status
characteristics directly and indirectly determine health and other outcomes (Link and Phelan 1995,
2005; Morey 2018). This situation is no different.

Disability-Based Economic Inequality
As axes of inequality, disabilities and chronic health conditions are associated with low
employment rates and earnings (Blanck et al. 2007; Maroto and Pettinicchio 2014a, 2015; Maroto,
Pettinicchio and Patterson 2019). Importantly, existing research shows considerable variation in
employment outcomes depending on the nature of the disability. Individuals with cognitive
disabilities are far more likely to experience negative labor market outcomes than individuals with
respiratory and heart problems and physical disabilities (Jones 2011; Zwerling et al 2002).

A major reason for poor labour market outcomes among people with disabilities is that they are
disproportionately clustered in low-paying, precarious, nonstandard work, often in the food

preparation and service industries (Maroto and Pettinicchio 2014b; Morris et al. 2018; Shuey and
Jovic 2013). Workers with cognitive and multiple disabilities are most likely to be employed in

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

these kinds of jobs while those with sensory limitations are least likely (Maroto and Pettinicchio
2014b; Pettinicchio and Maroto 2020; Wall 2017). The pandemic has most severely affected
sectors that people with disabilities tend to work in and, as a result, particularly harmed workers
who were already struggling with low earnings and financial insecurity (Mather and Jarosz 2020).

Canadian households who count a member with a disability have less wealth and hold far fewer
non-home assets than those without a disability (Maroto 2016; Maroto and Pettinicchio 2020a).
Many of these individuals live on the poverty line and cannot rely on savings in times of crises.
This likely varies by the type and severity of disability as these shape access to appropriate care
and social supports that facilitate maintaining steady income and covering higher costs of living.
Over one million Canadians are registered with the Disability Tax Credit (DTC), which covers
only a subset of disabled Canadians and is often required to access products like the Registered
Disability Savings Plan (RDSP) meant to mitigate financial insecurity. About 40% of individuals
registered with DTC list mental functional limitations and many on DTC for an indeterminate time
are experiencing difficulties in daily independent living activities. 1 Although RDSPs are meant to
encourage savings, program rules have been criticized for having the opposite effect and for
assuming individuals with few financial resources have any money to save.

As British Columbia, Alberta, Québec, and Ontario saw a rapidly increasing number of COVID19 cases in March 2020 (The Canadian Press 2020a), the federal government sought to address

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

threats to healthcare system capacity (The Canadian Press 2020b), embarked on massive national
information dissemination campaigns about the virus and ways to reduce risk, including new
protective and social distancing measures, and promised direct financial aid to Canadians, namely
via the taxable wage subsidy known as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (a.k.a., CERB).

CERB, which was extended twice throughout the spring and summer of 2020, was limited to
employed Canadians who had lost all or some income as a direct result of COVID-19. This means
that individuals, including many people with disabilities and others with chronic health conditions,
already struggling to find work before the pandemic, could not benefit from CERB (Leoppky
2020). In the fall, CERB was rolled into Employment Insurance offering Canadians a credit of
insured hours but this again remained problematic for the many disabled Canadians who did not
previously qualify for CERB. Instead, federal economic policies meant to aid Canadians with
disabilities during the pandemic have been relying on enhanced Goods and Services Tax (GST)
payments to cover rising costs. More recently, those with a valid DTC certificate were
automatically issued a one-time non-taxable $600 payment. In July, the government expanded this
program to include an additional 1.7 million Canadians with disabilities who either already receive
a CPP disability benefit or disability supports through Veterans Affairs Canada (Government of
Canada 2020b).

The continuously unfolding pandemic raises the issue of how changing policy responses and
programmatic rules are understood among already vulnerable groups who not only face a higher

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

risk of getting the virus, but also face uncertain economic futures. Disadvantaged groups including
people with disabilities and chronic health conditions do not have equal access to health resources,
social programs, and financial information (Chen et al. 2018; Pennycook et al. 2020; Van Rooij,
Lussardi and Alessie 2011) which influences how they perceive policy responses.

Varying Attitudes Towards Policy Responses
Although most Canadians support most measures taken to combat the coronavirus (Maru/Blue
Public Opinion 2021), policy responses to the pandemic in Canada have fundamentally restricted
everyday life activities, posing greater limitations for certain groups that no doubt affect how
individuals view government. Views regarding any government’s response to COVID-19 will
likely vary across factors that include a person’s specific situation and demographics, their existing
partisan beliefs, and their experiences with the pandemic. Although together they compose one of
the groups most vulnerable to the virus, people with disabilities and chronic health conditions
include a broad range of individuals with different disabilities, health conditions, demographics,
and political perspectives.

We examine variability in attitudes towards COVID-19 policy

responses based on specific disabilities and health conditions, experiences with COVID-19, and
broader partisan views and regional differences.

Disability and Health Status During the Pandemic
Varying disability and health statuses shape experiences with and attitudes about government

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

institutions and policy. In addition to being left out of income support programs (Shakeri 2020),
individuals with respiratory issues, those who experience debilitating panic attacks, people on the
autism spectrum, and people who rely on lip-reading to effectively communicate experienced
significant problems adhering to protective guidelines and were provided with few resources and
guidelines by public officials (The Canadian Press 2020c; Aslam, Hall, and the Canadian Press
2020). Against a backdrop of the crisis still unfolding in long-term care facilities, many people
with more severe disabilities who require in-home visits from care workers were not receiving
those supports (see Choi 2020) and social distancing and isolation measures have increasingly
been shown to have deleterious effects on individuals already struggling with health and mental
health issues (Vigo et al 2020; Emerson et al 2020). As such, attitudes towards COVID-19 policy
responses reflect extant experiences under new and continuously unfolding health and
socioeconomic scenarios.

Perceptions of policy fairness, whether about disparate impacts of social distancing measures or
economic impacts and burdens unduly placed on those already financially strained, have direct
bearing on public attitudes about government responses and subsequent public action (Han and
Zheng 2020). Individuals struggling economically because of their health and disability status tend
to have more negative perceptions of policy because they see themselves as victims of unjust
inequalities (Mattila 2020; see also Corcoran, Pettinicchio and Young 2011; 2015). Social
distancing, protective and lock down measures, as well as being left out of income support

programs could be seen as imposing unequal burdens and as ignoring already economically
vulnerable groups. This may shape short and long-term policy perceptions and attitudes towards

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

government (Mattila 2020).

Political Partisanship and Regional Variation
Public perceptions are also shaped by how Canadian policymakers collectively frame and define
rapidly unfolding issues (Mignone 2020; Howlett and Mignone 2019; Pettinicchio 2017; 2019)
and the ways in which these are communicated. They may signal consensus around providing
income supports (which in the case of CERB led to a swift government response), but disagreement
in how to approach lockdowns. The extent to which officials appear to be transparent, clear, and
consistent with their messaging shapes public attitudes (Mohammed et al. 2020; Driedger, Maier
and Jardine 2018; Quinn et al. 2013; Taha et al 2013). Merkeley et al. (2020) described a “crosspartisan consensus” among Canadian political elites that explains a lack of partisanship among
public attitudes and behaviours. In this vein, COVID-19 is thought to be largely apolitical in
Canada, where no one party challenged policies but, rather, rallied around the role of experts from
the start.

Nonetheless, Pennycook and colleagues (2020) show that partisan attitudes significantly shaped
how Canadians responded to the pandemic and to policies meant to address it. And, even Merkeley
et al. (2020) found a relationship between party affiliation and perceptions of severity in Canada,
where Conservatives viewed the pandemic as less severe. However, Bol et al. (2020) found that

pandemic-related lockdowns increased support for those in power and confidence in government

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

perhaps because the public saw the government taking necessary measures to keep citizens safe.

Recent studies have focused on consensus among political elites (Pennycook et al 2020; Merkeley
et al 2020) but this cross-partisanship may not neatly overlap with partisan differences in how the
Canadian public assesses federal government responses to the pandemic. This potential disconnect
between elite and public policy preferences may reflect growing political polarization among the
Canadian public more generally (Pettinicchio 2010; Cochrane 2015). Kevin and Soroka (2018)
show that partisan sorting on attitudes about redistribution in Canada has increased substantially
over the past two decades. In addition, deep historical regional divisions are clearly embodied
within the newly formed "Wexit" or “Maverick” party, pushing for Western Canadian sovereignty
(Dryden 2020). Regional divides are especially evident in Québec and in Prairie provinces, which
further complicate the link between public preferences and government responses to the pandemic
(Baer, Grabb, and Johnston 1993; Wiseman 2007).

Thus, while health pandemics can act as critical moments in shifting public perceptions about
politics and policy translating these attitudes into actions and behaviours (Merkeley et al 2020; Liu
and Mehta 2020), individuals still draw from personal experiences and long held partisan
preferences in understanding pandemic policy responses. With that, we examine support for
overall federal government responses to COVID-19 among people with disabilities and chronic
health conditions, a diverse but marginalized group that tends to be underrepresented in public
policy research. We focus on differences by disability and condition type, political affiliation,

public perceptions of government policy and policymakers in times of crisis.

Data

Data come from a quota-based online survey administered from June 11 to June 22, 2020, just as
many cities and provinces across Canada were beginning to end their "lockdowns" and "open up"
their economies. 2 We relied on Qualtrics, an internet-based survey research company that uses
paid panels of respondents, to help obtain a sample of people with disabilities and health conditions
across the country. In addition to payment received from the survey company, we provided
respondents with additional $10 Amazon.ca gift cards.

The survey includes 1,027 respondents age 18 and older who reported having one or more
disabilities or health conditions. Disabilities include physical, cognitive, vision, hearing, and
emotional limitations based on a set of six questions. We also included a category related to "other"
conditions lasting six months or longer. To gauge the severity of different disabilities, respondents
were given options of answering, “never,” “sometimes,” “often,” or “always” to each of these
questions. Health conditions include asthma, cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic respiratory
disease, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, obesity, and being immunocompromised. Questions
asking about disability were based on the Canadian Survey on Disability (Cloutier, Grondin, and

As of June 22, 2020, there were 101,019 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Canada and 8,410 deaths with both cases

Government of Canada as increasing vulnerability to COVID-19 (Government of Canada 2020c).

Data were collected via quota-based sampling to ensure that we obtained a representative sample
across provinces with 38% of responses from Ontario, 23% from Québec, 13% from British
Columbia, 18% from the Prairie provinces (Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan), and 7% from the
Atlantic provinces (Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince
Edward Island) based on 2016 Census population estimates (Statistics Canada 2017). We choose
not to include any other characteristics within our quotas or weight our data after collection. In
particular, we do not use poststratification, a weighting method commonly used when analyzing
data from web-based surveys to adjust for under-coverage, nonresponse, and self-selection in the
sample (Bethlehem 2010; Schonlau et al. 2009). This method uses auxiliary information on true
population values, from census data or probability-based surveys, to generate weights that can be
applied to each respondent in a web-based survey so that the sample as a whole better represents
the population. However, this procedure requires the distribution of characteristics in a population
to be known. In our case, it was unclear on which population characteristics we should base any
weights since there have been no other random surveys of individuals with disabilities and chronic
health conditions. However, many of the characteristics of this group (e.g., age, gender, and
education) mirror those for individuals sampled in the Canadian Survey on Disability and the

Measures and Methods

We analyze respondents' views of the federal government's response to COVID-19 as our key
outcome variable. Specifically, respondents were asked “In general, how would you rate the
federal government’s response to COVID-19?” We asked respondents to provide a rating on a
scale of 0-10 (0 being the lowest, 10 being the highest) and then further elaborate on that rating in
an open-ended question. We combined results into the three following categories: negative
assessment (score of 0-4), neutral assessment (score of 5-7), and positive assessment (score of 810).

We then analyzed this outcome using a set of multinomial logistic regression models. 4
Multinomial models expand on basic logistic regression models to allow for the inclusion of
outcome variables with multiple categories. Within these models, the probability of membership
in each category is compared to the probability of membership in a designated reference category
(Liao, 1994; Menard, 2002). 5 Additionally, by interpreting our results as average marginal effects

4

We tested other combinations of categories, as well as a series of logit and linear models, and found similar
relationships across variables. Results are available in the online appendix.
5
Ordered logistic regression models present another alternative for analyzing ordered categorical data. However,
these models assume that the relationship between each pair of outcomes is the same (proportional odds assumption)
and initial model tests showed that our data violated this assumption. We therefore chose the more flexible

options. Standard errors account for clustering by province. All models include demographic and
economic control variables. 6

Our first set of predictor variables focuses on variation by disability and chronic health condition
type. 7 We include variables for six disabilities. The first four measure whether the respondent
reported having any difficulty seeing (even when wearing glasses or contact lenses); hearing (even
when using a hearing aid); walking, using stairs, using your hands or fingers or doing other
physical activities; and learning, remembering or concentrating. Two other variables measure
whether the respondent reported any emotional, psychological or mental health conditions and any
other health problems or long-term conditions that have lasted or are expected to last for six months
or more. Disability-related questions also allowed respondents to indicate the severity of their
disability by responding “never,” “sometimes,” “often,” or “always.” We focus on more severe
disabilities and code respondents who indicated they often or always experienced the outcomes as
reporting that disability.

We classified chronic health conditions based on whether the respondent indicated the presence
of the nine following conditions: Asthma; Cancer; Chronic kidney disease; Chronic respiratory or

multinomial logistic regression model for our analyses. Ordinal logistic regression results are available in the online
Appendix C.

Demographic controls include age, gender, race, parental and marital status, and education. We also controlled for
employment status and homeownership.

Descriptive statistics for these variables appear in Appendix A.

New Democratic Party, and Other or No Party. 8 Province/region includes categories of Ontario
(referent), Québec, British Columbia, Prairie Provinces (Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan),
and Atlantic Provinces (Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and
Nova Scotia). 9

To assess experiences with COVID-19 in a third set of predictor variables, we include a series of
composite variables measuring COVID-19 expenses, informed about COVID-19, and concerned
about COVID-19. Composite variables combine the results of multiple variables measured on the
same or similar scales, facilitating comparison. We use a process of meaningful grouping and
averaging. We also include dichotomous variables measuring whether the respondent applied for
CERB and whether a respondent’s financial situation has worsened during the pandemic.

COVID-19 expenses is a composite variable assessing the economic effects of COVID-19 on the
respondent's finances. It comprises responses to the following five questions: "Since COVID-19

8

The "Other or No Party" categories includes respondents who listed parties with smaller membership, such as the
Green Party, the People's Party, and Bloc Québécois, as well as respondents who indicated "Other party" or no
preference.
9
We grouped smaller provinces together due to sample size limitations.

contact a financial institution to request mortgage or loan payment deferrals, and (d.) rely on
government programs like, but not exclusively, CERB to make ends meet." Values for the
composite variable are the respondent's average across these questions, which we measured as
binary (0=no, 1=yes) responses with ⍺ = 0.664.

The COVID-19 information composite variable assesses how informed the respondent is about
COVID-19. It includes responses to the following four questions: "How informed do you believe
you are about (a.) access to COVID-19 testing, (b.) how to get treatment for COVID-19, (c.)
COVID-19 symptoms, and (d.) what to do if you suspect you have COVID-19." Original variable
values were uniformed (0), somewhat informed (1), and very informed (2). Composite variable
scores are the respondent's averages with ⍺ = 0.797.

The COVID-19 concerned variable includes responses for the following seven questions: "How
concerned are you with (a.) contracting COVID-19 yourself, (b.) a friend or family member
contracting COVID-19, (c.) paying your bills, (d.) keeping your job, (e.) finishing your degree, (f.)
accessing healthcare, and (g.) shopping for essential goods. Original variable values were not
concerned (0), somewhat concerned (1), and very concerned (2). Composite variable scores are
the respondent's averages with ⍺ = 0.799.

In addition to our quantitative ratings of federal government responses to COVID-19, we also
analyzed qualitative responses to an open-ended survey question asking respondents to explain

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

why they provided the ratings they did. Specifically, respondents were asked “Why did you select
that score?” after choosing a rating. We inductively coded responses to these open-ended questions
and identified emergent themes associated with reasons respondents gave for their quantitative
assessments of policy responses. We also linked the codes associated with respondents’ qualitative
responses to their demographic and attitudinal characteristics to help contextualize their reasoning.

Findings

We found broad support for the federal government's response to COVID-19. Most respondents
thought that the federal government was doing a good job addressing the pandemic. As shown in
Table 1, the average score for the federal government was 6.84 with 13.24% of respondents rating
their response negatively, 42.06% giving it a neutral rating, and 44.69% giving it a positive rating.
Examining differences across key variables shows a potential relationship with some disabilities
and chronic health conditions. Scores also tended to be lower among respondents affiliated with
the Conservative Party, those living in the Prairie provinces, and those who reported worsening
financial situations.

When asked why they provided a certain rating, most individuals did not elaborate upon their
quantitative assessments of government responses to COVID-19. Many qualitative responses

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

involved restating a numerical assessment in words without any further elaboration, as in the case
of statements like “The government is doing [a] very good job,” “Sickening Response,” and “I
think the job they did was fine but it should have been a lot better.” Other respondents framed their
assessments in terms of preconceived expectations of how the government would handle a
pandemic although not necessarily referring to any specific government policy or action. Their
responses encompassed a range from “seems like they could be doing more” to “surprisingly
great.”

Importantly, some respondents indicated that they were unable to provide further justification
because they admittedly lacked knowledge about government responses. Statements like, “I do not
[know] enough about what the government is doing in this case to make a comment” and “I don't
follow the news” point to attitudes and beliefs that cannot be readily articulated. This suggests that
respondents not only lacked specific information about government actions related to COVID-19
even in the most general sense but that, relatedly, their assessments may be based on other kinds
of information including pre-existing beliefs about government, partisan preferences, and their
own experiences throughout the pandemic.

Table 2 presents the results from multinomial logit models predicting respondents' views of the
federal government's response to COVID-19. We report model coefficients as average marginal
effects for each of the three categories of negative, neutral, or positive. Coefficients can be

associated with a change in the specified predictor variable. Original model coefficients are

available in Appendix C.

[Table 2]

Results in Table 2 show that respondents' support for the federal government's response to COVID19 was largely driven by partisanship, region, and COVID-19 experiences with a few differences
by disability and chronic health condition type. We therefore focus our interpretation on these
variables and further illustrate these results in Figures 1, 2, and 3. These figures plot the predicted
probabilities of reporting a negative, neutral, or positive response associated with different levels
of these key predictor variables. Figure 1 includes disability and health condition, Figure 2 includes
partisan preferences and region, and Figure 3 includes COVID-19 experiences. Categories are
listed for categorical variables. Three levels of low, mean, and high are listed for the continuous
variables. These refer to values at the mean and one standard deviation above and below the mean.
Results come from models with all control variables.

Type of Disability and Chronic Health Condition

Comparing results by specific disabilities and chronic health conditions, Table 2 and Figure 1 show
that there is not much variation in support for the federal government’s response to COVID-19
across these variables. However, a few groups do stand out. People with physical disabilities
tended to view the government response more positively than people with other types of
disabilities. For instance, only 7.4% reported a negative response, compared to 10-22% of people
reporting other disabilities. Percentages with a positive response, however, were more similar
across disabilities. In terms of health conditions, people with chronic kidney conditions, diabetes,
or cancer were the least likely to report a negative response.

Qualitative responses provide limited insight into the reasons behind observed differences in
support between these disability groups. Respondents generally did not explain their assessments
with reference to their disability or health status, suggesting that these were not key considerations
when evaluating government responses. Occasionally, however, justifications referenced
vulnerable groups seen as having received insufficient attention and support. In these comments,
respondents discussed how the government had not done enough to help vulnerable Canadians,
including those with disabilities. Numerous respondents mentioned that existing supports were not
helping everyone in need, “insufficient,” and constituted a poorly thought out “patchwork” of
programs.

Political Partisanship and Region

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

Specific partisan differences were most evident when considering negative responses in Table 2.
Compared to respondents who identified with or supported the Liberal Party, Conservative Party
supporters were 26.0 percentage points more likely to have a negative assessment of the federal
government's response, NDP members were 5.9 percentage points more likely, and members of
other parties were 12.3 percentage points more likely. Conservative Party supporters were also
36.6 percentage points less likely to have positive responses.

Comparing political parties in Figure 2, Liberals were the most likely group to provide a positive
assessment of the federal government's response, perhaps not surprisingly with a Liberal minority
government led by Justin Trudeau. Conservatives stood out with the greatest proportion having a
negative response; 19.4% rated the federal government negatively compared to 3-9% of Liberals
and NDP members. Conservatives were also much less likely to have a positive response with
23.8% rating the government positively.

Across regions, the Prairie provinces stood out as having lower ratings of the federal government's
response to COVID-19. Respondents in the Prairie provinces were 3.2 percentage points more
likely to provide a negative response and 8.7 percentage points less likely to give a neutral
response, but they were also 5.5 percentage points more likely to provide a positive response than
those in Ontario (Table 2). Overall, 16.1% of Prairie residents rated the response as negative.
However, the significant difference here was with those reporting neutral responses; 35.0% of

respondents in the Prairies provided a neutral response compared to 42-45% among the other

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

provinces, suggesting more polarized views of the federal government in that region.

Open-ended responses provided further insight into how partisanship shapes attitudes about the
federal response to COVID-19, with fewer patterns present across regions. Although some
respondents, mostly those identifying with the Conservative Party, expressed concerns about
policies limiting basic freedoms and that the pandemic is being blown out of proportion, these
were a very small minority.

Rather, quite common among negative assessments was the belief that federal economic responses
to COVID-19 constituted an irresponsible, wasteful use of taxpayer money that would add too
much to the federal budget deficit. A familiar “small-c” conservative critique of “small-l” liberal
fiscal policies, this kind of response was especially common among respondents who identified
with the Conservative Party. Criticisms from Conservative respondents regularly implicated Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau directly: “the PM keeps giving away money that the country does not
have,” “I haven't been impressed with the way Justin has been throwing money around with no
real oversight” and “Trudeau has gone crazy giving away so much money.” Concerns about
spending, the deficit and the fear of higher taxes in the future were expressed by members of other
parties as well.

More specifically, Conservative respondents also expressed concern that federal funds were being
used to pay benefits to those who did not qualify or were otherwise undeserving. For example,

even though CERB is taxable income, one respondent explained, “They've been doing a decent
job however they have mismanaged the CERB in giving the same amount to everyone and not

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

taxing it. People who should be receiving the base amount of EI are making twice as much and
those who should be receiving the max aren't getting that much. And there are many who are
getting it that shouldn't be.” Concerns about CERB were not limited to Conservative respondents.
Some worried about lack of accountability and that CERB serves as a disincentive to work.

However, negative assessments among non-Conservatives also emphasized gaps in existing
benefit programs when it comes to seniors and people with disabilities. For example, a Liberal
respondent noted that the federal government has “made strides to support people that have been
economically affected by COVID-19, though the benefits seem to be a little bit scattershot at
times.” Expressing overall support for federal government responses, a respondent identifying with
none of the main federal parties wished “they'd done more for the elderly and disabled. A one-time
payment simply isn't enough. Everything is becoming more and more expensive.” Much more
critical, an NDP supporter wrote that “The government failed in supporting vulnerable people. The
pandemic shows that the system is rigged in favour of the wealthy.”

Negative assessments among respondents identifying as Conservative reflect long-standing
conflicts with Liberals, and in some cases, Trudeau himself. Conservative respondents in particular
frequently emphasized the theme of government overreach. For example, respondents often
expressed concern that the Liberal government used the existing state of emergency granting
government temporary emergency powers as a means to encroach on civil liberties and further

24

their own political aims. As one respondent declared, “…they also seem to be circumventing our

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

political system to do as they please with no opposition.”

Conservative respondents were also more likely to tie current social and cultural issues, like gun
rights, police funding, and Black Lives Matter, into their negative assessments. A few respondents
specifically cited Trudeau’s appearance at an anti-racism demonstration 10 on Parliament Hill
coinciding with large-scale protests in cities in the United States in the wake of the police killing
of George Floyd. As one respondent phrased it, “Over the top and double standards. People protest
losing their jobs [and] gov[ernment] says they're irresponsible but [at] BLM protest some even
broke windows in Canada and our PM takes a knee in a crowd.” Another respondent specifically
describing Trudeau’s appearance at the demonstration wrote that it “is a disgrace to all my brothers
in blue.” Playing on the broader belief that the Liberals have used the crisis to “seize total control,”
a respondent identifying with the far-right populist People’s Party in their assessment referred to
“a totally unjust and nonsensical gun ban by order in council.”

When it comes to partisan preferences, our findings indicate that for the most part, Conservatives,
who were by far the most critical of the federal Liberal government's response to the pandemic,
drew upon pre-existing political conflicts but also on salient cultural and social cleavages in
justifying their criticism. Liberals and especially NDP supporters also expressed negative

During a moment of silence at the demonstration, Trudeau, wearing a mask, was seen bowing his head and
dropping to one knee in an expression of solidarity with the protest movement.

assessments but these were more often framed in terms of socio-economic inequalities in the

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

pandemic response and critiques of benefits going to landlords and large corporations.

COVID-19 Experiences

Respondents’ perceptions of the federal government's response were also shaped by their
understandings of, and experiences with, COVID-19. Differences across these variables, however,
were most apparent when considering how informed respondents felt about COVID-19, as shown
in Table 2. A one-unit increase in how informed respondents were about COVID-19 was
associated with a 4.0 percentage point decrease in rating the government’s response negatively, a
12.1 percentage point decrease in giving a neutral rating, and a 16.1 percentage point increase in
rating the government’s response positively.

Figure 3 shows that feeling informed about COVID-19 was also associated with attitudes about
the federal government's response in different ways. The proportion of respondents rating the
government negatively decreased from 15.1% to 11.1% when moving from low to high levels of
feeling informed. Differences were even more apparent when comparing other categories. For
instance, 36.6% of people reporting low levels of information around COVID-19 rated the federal
government’s response positively compared to 52.6% of those with high levels of information.
Thus, those who felt more informed about COVID-19 also thought that the government was doing
a better job of addressing it.

Although reporting specific-COVID-19-related expense increases was not associated with views,
reporting worsening financial situations was. Respondents who experienced financial hardship in

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

the previous year were also more likely to rate the government’s response negatively by 3.8
percentage points and less likely to rate it positively by 7.6 percentage points (Table 2). These
differences translated into 15.4% of respondents with worsening finances reporting negative
views, 44.4% reporting neutral views, and 40.1% reporting positive views (Figure 3).

In addition, benefits receipt was positively associated with support for the federal government’s
response. Respondents who applied for CERB were more likely to rate the government's response
positively by 8.1 percentage points and less likely to provide a negative rating by 5.4 percentage
points than those who had not applied for CERB (Table 2). According to Figure 3, 50.1% of
respondents who applied for CERB rated the government's response as positive, 39.8% rated it as
neutral, and 9.2% rated it as negative.

In their qualitative responses, individuals regularly discussed their perceptions of the federal
government with reference to their own experiences, especially in receiving government supports,
most notably CERB. One respondent expressed overall approval of government benefit programs
while being unhappy about their own experience with receiving benefits: “The federal government
did what was required in the immediate wake of the crisis, and despite the fact that I do not qualify
for CERB, its rollout was quick and effective for most of Canada… yeah, I'm still grumpy about
the CERB thing.” Indeed, those who rated the federal response positively also regularly referenced
their experiences with benefit receipt as a justification, as in the case in this response: “… the

CERB program was excellent and made me able to cope throughout these tough times. I am very

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

pleased [with] my government services.”

Others, who gave neutral ratings, also discussed their own and others’ experiences with CERB,
pointing out issues they saw in its implementation. One respondent indicated that “CERB is good
but it should be based on income and expenses, not just a general number everyone gets. Some
people live rent-free while others (like me) have to use almost the whole benefit for living
expenses, so I think it could be a little more equitable.” Respondents who held more negative
perceptions of federal government responses linked these to their inability to make ends meet
despite government benefits as a rationale. For example, one senior wrote that “when you have
high drug expenses and rent to pay the money they've promised doesn't go very far. And the money
they promised which should have been paid out at the beginning of June has now been pushed
back to sometime in July.” Others similarly noted insufficient support provided by benefits: “my
husband’s income dropped by more than 25% and there was no help for him... and CERB paid me
less than EI.”

The variation in perceptions about federal government responses suggests that individuals who are
benefitting from CERB are likely having more of their needs met, feel more financially secure,
and thus have more favourable attitudes about government. On the flip side, our findings suggest
that these policy responses are not meeting the needs of all Canadians – especially people with
disabilities and chronic health conditions who are not benefitting from CERB and are facing a host
of different social, economic, and health-related challenges during the pandemic.

Discussion

This study examined relationships between respondents' reported disabilities and chronic health
conditions, partisanship, regionality, and experiences with COVID-19 and their views of the
federal government’s response to COVID-19. We focused on an already disadvantaged group in
Canadian society — people with disabilities and chronic health conditions. Despite these
vulnerabilities, this group was largely ignored by policymakers until about three months into the
pandemic. Even so, when it comes to federal financial support, the vast majority of people with
disabilities and chronic health conditions who are not benefitting from CERB continue to be
excluded from aid programs. As we find, experiences with COVID-19 among these individuals
mattered a great deal in shaping perceptions of government responses. However, our findings also
point to broader factors, as political preferences tended to be a stronger predictor of support for
federal government responses to the crisis. Indeed, our findings show that respondents' support
for government responses was highly partisan. Our findings are corroborated by more recent public
opinion polls, like ones conducted in Alberta, for example, where satisfaction with federal
government responses showed significant splintering along party lines (Fletcher 2020).

Some of the largest differences were seen between respondents affiliated with the Liberal and
Conservative parties, with Liberals voicing the most support and Conservatives voicing the least.
As the qualitative responses demonstrate, part of this was driven by broader political views
surrounding government spending likely to be the case in the general population as well. Our

findings reveal that while political elites by and large demonstrated consensus around how to
respond to COVID-19, thus transcending party lines, the public displayed stronger views, a lot of

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

which reflect traditional left-right divides over government spending and who is most “deserving”
of government benefits. Although it is among those who believe governments have gone too far
where we saw the most partisan responses, Liberal and NDP supporters also noted that too many
vulnerable people are being excluded from government programs.

Future work should investigate these claims at the provincial level, linking partisan preferences to
perceptions of provincial government responses where many more governments are led by
Conservatives. Our findings indicate more nuanced relationships between party affiliation and
support for provincial government responses to the pandemic, where Conservatives in provinces
with Conservative governments are still more critical of their government than Liberals. Some of
this may be attributable to concerns over spending even by Conservative-led governments as well
as significant social distancing measures enacted by Conservatives in provinces like Ontario, for
example.

We presented findings from one of the few national Canadian surveys that focuses on people with
disabilities and chronic health conditions. Due to many of the larger limitations regarding survey
research today, including underrepresentation of marginalized communities, quota sampling is
extremely useful in studying the immediate effects of health crises on people with disabilities and
chronic health conditions. Although quota sampling is not truly reflective of a random sample of
the population, our sample does mirror the demographic characteristics of members of the target

population of interest which in this case, is Canadians with disabilities and chronic health
conditions, as discussed in the Appendix. However, this online survey likely missed many people

without access to computers or the Internet. Results still provide us with considerable
understanding of individuals’ experiences and views regarding government responses to COVID19, giving voice to a group that is often overlooked in politics and policymaking.

Conclusion

Policy preferences among people with disabilities and chronic health conditions reflect broader
partisan divides, as well as health and economic situations specific to this group. Our paper alludes
to how this plays out in relation to support for federal government responses to the COVID-19
crisis. Although respondents mentioned feeling left out and overlooked – “we are the forgotten,”
as one respondent put it – perceptions of government responses were less directly driven by
respondents' status as people with disabilities or as having chronic health conditions and more by
partisan divisions and broader social, economic, and cultural cleavages (Harell 2020). However,
disability and health status may be having indirect effects on attitudes about government via
personal experiences with COVID-19, which include financial concerns, barriers in accessing
health and social services, and worries about what the so-called “new normal” will look like for
them.

Our paper speaks to current considerations but it also alludes to long-term implications both with
regards to health and financial wellbeing and with perceptions of government policy and

policymakers. The pandemic is ever-evolving. What many respondents have voiced is that
effective policy pandemic countermeasures should include targeted efforts to help disadvantaged

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

groups in addition to broader efforts in addressing social conditions shaping experiences during
and post-crisis. Policymakers have long recognized that the needs of persons with disabilities are
often overlooked during disasters and emergencies and ensuing recovery efforts. Canada and
others have affirmed their commitment to take disability-related needs into account in all disasterrelated policies and practices through international agreements including the United Nations
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk
Reduction 2015-2020. In this regard, policy experts are calling for permanent income supports
targeting disability and health groups (Prince 2020), paralleling similar calls to institutionalize
CERB into a universal basic income for all (Snell 2020; Willms and Montgomery 2020). Whatever
the case, when it comes to recovery, exclusion should not be the “new normal.”

Appendix A: Survey Data Information and Descriptive Overview

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

The 2020 COVID-19 Response Survey of People with Disabilities and Health Conditions is a
quota-based online survey administered from June 11-22, 2020 with the help of Qualtrics
(https://www.qualtrics.com), an internet-based survey company, to obtain a sample of people with
disabilities and health conditions across provinces. Qualtrics recruits participants from a range of
online research panels with which the company partners. These panels consist of pools of people
who have been recruited to take regular surveys for academic and corporate researchers. Panelists
provide detailed and updated personal information to panel maintainers, including demographic
information. Qualtrics, as a panel aggregator, matches respondents to surveys based on their
profiles and randomly selects them to take surveys that they are likely to quality for, based on a
given survey’s eligibility criteria.

In the case of our online survey, we provided Qualtrics with eligibility criteria based on age, region,
and health and disability status, which it used to recruit participants from appropriate online panels
to our survey. Qualtrics takes steps to ensure that a respondent does not take the same survey
multiples times or self-select into particular surveys based on the survey topic and incentives. Our
survey instrument also included additional screening questions and attention checks to mitigate
potential data quality issues. We included location-based sampling quotas to ensure that the
proportion of respondents from each province within our final sample matches the proportion of
the Canadian population located in each province.

Online samples of the type used in this survey are common in the social sciences and frequently
used as an alternative to much costlier traditional survey and sampling methods, such as those

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

based on telephone interviews and random digit dialing.

We began with 1,392 respondents. Twenty-nine cases were initially dropped due to poor quality
(including gibberish) in their qualitative responses. An additional 51 cases were removed as
respondents did not complete the survey. In order to ensure that respondents were carefully
reading and answering the survey questions, we included two quality control screening questions
that required respondents provide a specific answer. Those who did not correctly answer both
quality control questions were screened out of the survey. A final 285 cases were removed because
respondents either did not meet the inclusion criteria or failed quality control and attention checks.
This resulted in our final sample of 1,027 respondents with no missing data across variables.

The median survey response time was 20 minutes and the mean was 29 minutes. Survey response
times ranged from 6 minutes to 15 hours. Longer response times likely reflected instances where
respondents began the survey, left it open on their devices, and then went back to complete it later
on. Ninety-five percent of respondents completed the survey in under one hour and 80% of
respondents completed the survey in less than thirty minutes.
Descriptive Information
Table A1 presents descriptive statistics for our survey sample. The mean age for respondents in
our sample was 49 years, which is older than the mean age of 41 years for the population in 2016

(Statistics Canada 2020a). This was expected, however, because disabilities and chronic health

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

conditions tend to be more prevalent among older population (CCDSS 2019; Morris et al. 2018).

[Table A1]

The gender make-up of our sample was 53% female, 46% male, and 1% non-binary or other.
According to the 2017 CSD, disabilities are more prevalent among women; 56% of people with
disabilities were female (Morris et al. 2018, p. 8). Ninety percent of respondents self-identified as
heterosexual, 3.5% identified as homosexual (gay or lesbian), 5.0% as bisexual, and 1.3% reported
other identities, such as asexual, transgender, and two spirit. Data on sexual orientation are limited,
but across several U.S. and Canadian studies 1-2.3% of the population identified as gay or lesbian,
0.7-2.9% as bisexual, and 0.6% as transgender (Waite and Denier 2019). A greater proportion of
respondents identified as a sexual minority in our data than as estimated for the larger population.
However, additional research shows that rates of disability tend to be higher among lesbian, gay,
and bisexual adults (Fredricksen-Goldsen, Kim, and Barkan 2012).

In terms of education, 22.8% of respondents had a high school diploma or less education; 11.1%
had some post-secondary education but no diploma; 31.1% completed an apprenticeship, trades,
or college certificate; 24.7% had a Bachelor's degree; and 10.3% obtain a degree beyond a
Bachelor's, such as a doctorate, master's, or professional degree. Respondents obtained somewhat
more education than the population across Canada. Among adults age 25-64 in Canada, 35.3% had
a high school diploma or less (this includes people with some post-secondary education but no

degree; 36.3% had an apprenticeship, trades, college certificate, or university certificate below a
Bachelor's degree; and 28.5% obtained a Bachelor's degree or higher in 2016 (Statistics Canada

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

2020b).

Approximately 35.2% of respondents were employed full-time and another 12.6% were employed
part-time, 4.4% were unemployed, and 47.9% were not in the labor force, which included
homemakers, students, retired persons, and people unable to work due to COVID-19. In this
sample, 8.8% of respondents reported that they were unable to work due to COVID-19. According
to the 2017 CSD the employment rate among people with disabilities was 59.4% (Morris et al.
2018), which indicates a lower employment rate in our sample (47.8%). However, percentages are
much closer when respondents unable to work due to COVID-19 considered.

Racialized groups are likely underrepresented in this sample. The percentage who identify as
Indigenous within our sample (2.3%) was approximately half that of the percentage in the larger
population (4.9%) in 2016 (Statistics Canada 2020a). The percentage who identify as non-white
in our sample (17.8%) was also lower than the percentage of people who identify as visible
minorities in Canada (22.3%). Immigrants and non-citizens were also underrepresented in this
sample with 14.4% of respondents indicating they immigrated to Canada compared to 21.9% of
the population and 5.5% of respondents indicating that they were not Canadian citizens compared
to 7.0% of the population. However, again, it is not clear as to whether these groups are over- or
under-represented within groups of people with disabilities and CHCs.

When comparing sample respondents to individuals age 15 and older in Canada, the sample closely
mirrored the population in terms of marital status and household size. Within the sample, 53.0%

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

of respondents were married or cohabiting, 31.5% were never married, and 15.5% were formerly
married. Across Canada in 2016, 57.4% of individuals age 15 and older were married or in
common law relationships, 28.2% were never married, and 14.2% were formerly married
(Statistics Canada 2020a).

Finally, data were collected via quota-based sampling to ensure that we obtained a representative
sample across provinces. We obtained a sample with 38% of responses from Ontario, 23% from
Québec, 13% from British Columbia, 18% from the Prairie provinces (Alberta, Manitoba,
Saskatchewan), and 7% from the Atlantic provinces (Newfoundland and Labrador, New
Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island) based on 2016 Census population estimates.

Disability and chronic health conditions

Table A2 provides further information regarding the prevalence of different disabilities and
chronic health conditions among sample participants. Overall, 10.6% of respondents reported a
single disability or condition, 35.0% reported 2-3 disabilities or conditions, 32.4% reported 4-5
disabilities or conditions, and 22.0% reported six or more disabilities or conditions.

Disability-related questions allowed respondents to indicate the severity of their disability by
reporting whether they sometimes, often, or always experienced any vision, hearing, physical,

cognitive, emotional, or other difficulties. Table A2 includes rates of any disability for whether
the respondent indicated sometimes, often, or always and rates of more severe disabilities for

whether the respondent indicated often or always. In both cases, emotional or other disabilities
were the most commonly reported.

Regarding chronic health conditions, diabetes, asthma, hypertension, and obesity were the most
common chronic health conditions reported by participants. Fewer participants (<6%) reported
conditions like cancer, kidney disease, respiratory disease, heart disease, and being
immunocompromised.

Appendix B: Comparison with CCHS Data

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

To further verify the representativeness of our sample, we compare our data to a subsample of the
2017-18 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS). Although this survey does not include
identical disability and health condition variables, it does provide variables close enough to ours
to allow for a comparison of demographics across a subsample of adults age 18+ with reported
disabilities or chronic health conditions.

The original 2017-18 CCHS sample included 113,290 cases. Removing missing data for our
variables of interest and restricting the sample to adults age 18 and older living in provinces
reduced our sample size to 94,797 cases. We then restricted this sample to individuals who reported
one or more disabilities or chronic health conditions, which resulted in a final sample size of 60,082
cases.

Within this sample, a respondent is considered as having a disability if they indicated that they had
some difficulty, a lot of difficulty, or inability (cannot do at all) in regard to seeing (even with
glasses), hearing (even with a hearing aid), walking or climbing stairs, remembering or
concentrating, self-care, or communicating. In order to include emotional disabilities, we also
counted individuals who reported that they had a major mood or anxiety disorder.

We also included individuals with the following chronic health conditions: asthma, respiratory
conditions, hypertension, heart diseases, diabetes, and cancer. Although we also wanted to include

obesity in this analysis, we omitted this variable due to the amount of missing data with it. The

survey also did not include questions regarding being immunocompromised.

Table B1 presents information regarding the prevalence of disability and chronic health conditions
in the full CCHS sample. In the larger sample, 43.7% of respondents reported any disability
(having at least some difficulty across designated areas) and 18.1% reported a more severe
disability (having a lot of difficulty or cannot do at all). Additional, 30.9% of respondents reported
having one of six designated chronic health conditions.

[Table B1]

Table B2 presents descriptive statistics for demographic variables in the CCHS subset of people
with disabilities or chronic health conditions. Comparing these to data from the 2020 COVID-19
Disability Survey, the CCHS sample is slightly older with a mean age of 51.6 years compared to
49.0 years in the COVID-19 Disability Survey. Gender composition is similar across surveys with
a slightly greater proportion of men in both. Notably, the CCHS did not permit respondents to
report a gender other than male or female. We also do not include a comparison based on sexual
identity due to the larger percentage of missing data on this variable in the CCHS.

Similar to earlier comparisons with national population data, a comparison with the CCHS again
shows that immigrants and Indigenous persons were underrepresented within the COVID-19
Disability Survey sample. It also shows that our sample has attained somewhat higher levels of

education with 66.1% of the COVID-19 Disability Survey obtaining a PSE certificate or higher
compared to 59.1% of CCHS respondents. Employment rates were closer across surveys. In the

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

COVID-19 Disability Survey, 47.7% of respondents were employed at the time of the survey
compared to 50.0% of CCHS respondents. As expected during the pandemic, the unemployment
rate among COVID-19 Disability Survey respondents was higher.

The CCHS marital status variable categories differ from those used in the COVID-19 Disability
Survey, but it appears as those marriage rates were lower in the COVID-19 Disability Survey.
Within the COVID-19 Disability Survey 39.5% of respondents were married, 13.4% were
cohabiting, 15.5% were formerly married, and 31.5% were never married. Within the CCHS,
50.0% of respondents were married, 11.8% were in common law unions, 16.1% were formerly
married, and 22.1% were single.

[Table B2]

Finally, Table B3 presents information regarding the prevalence of different types of disabilities
and chronic health conditions in the CCHS subsample. This table shows that most specific
disabilities were more prevalent across respondents in the COVID-19 Disability Survey. A greater
percentage of COVID-19 Disability Survey respondents were also more likely to report most
conditions, except for hypertension and heart disease, which were more prevalent in the CCHS
subsample.

It is important to note that the ways in which questions were phrased and the options given to
respondents differ across surveys. For instance, COVID-19 Disability Survey respondents were

https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cpp.2021-012 - Wednesday, February 17, 2021 4:55:19 PM - IP Address:70.24.75.138

given options of “no,” “sometimes,” “always,” and “never.” CCHS respondents were given
options of “no difficulty,” “some difficulty,” “a lot of difficulty,” and “cannot do at all / unable to
do.”

[Table B3]

Overall, this comparison between the 2020 COVID-19 Disability Survey and the 2017-18 CCHS
subsample of people with disabilities and chronic health conditions shows both similarities and
differences across survey respondents. Although age and gender composition are similar across
survey respondents, differences do appear in regard to race and education. It is important to note
that the disabilities and conditions included across surveys are not identical, however, a factor that
could also affect the composition of survey respondents.

19 Response

Table C1 presents results from multinomial logistic regression models predicting negative, neutral,
or positive views of the federal government's COVID-19 response. The table shows model
coefficients (b) and odds ratios (OR) for three comparisons. Model 1 compares neutral to negative
responses. Model 2 compares positive to negative responses. Model 3 compares positive to neutral
responses. These tables inform Table 2 and the figures in the full paper.

Tables C2-C4 present results from supplemental models assessing support for the federal
government's COVID-19 response. Table C2 presents results from a linear regression model
predicting support as a continuous variable ranging from 0 to 10. Table C3 presents results from a
logistic regression model predicting positive views of the government's response. Table C4
presents results from an ordinal logistic regression model predicting negative, neutral, or positive
views of the federal government's COVID-19 response.
