Key Points
-

-

Student absences after the first wave of Covid-19 school closures were higher than in
previous years
Higher rates of absenteeism after school lockdown were due to COVID-19 related
reasons
Overall, non-Covid-19-related absence rates are similar to trends observed in earlier
years
Socioeconomic inequalities in school absenteeism were higher post-lockdown than in
previous years
This increase can be attributed to rising disparities in school absenteeism due to
Covid-19-related and non-Covid-19 reasons
The rise in socioeconomic inequality in non-Covid-19related absenteeism was not
only due to higher absence rates among students from the most deprived areas but
also due to lower absence rates among students from the least deprived areas
Addressing the disproportionate short- and long-term impact of the pandemic on the
most vulnerable children needs to be at the forefront of policy agenda
We need greater monitoring and evaluation of
o inequalities in home learning during the second round of school closures
o inequalities in academic achievement after school reopening
o policy interventions designed to mitigate the consequences of Covid-19 on
achievement gaps.

School attendance is crucial for children’s educational attainment (e.g., Ansari & Pianta, 2019)
and particularly for children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds (Ready, 2010). During
the Covid-19 school closures, socioeconomic inequalities in engagement with home learning
have exacerbated (Andrew et al., 2020; Kuhfeld et al., 2020; The DELVE Initiative, 2020),
which likely led to an increase in disparities in educational achievement (Engzell, Frey &
Verhagen, 2020). To reduce further learning loss and mitigate socioeconomic gaps in
achievement and wellbeing for all children, governments around the world reopened schools
immediately after the first wave of Covid-19 pandemic (Scottish Government, 2020a&b; DFE,
2020; Bryant, Dorn, Hall, & Panier, 2020; Barton & Parekh, 2020).
In Scotland, a key approach to reopening schools and containing the spread of the virus
required that children self-isolate if they test positive for Covid-19, show any symptoms of
Covid-19, or have a close family member who tests positive for the virus (Scottish
Government, 2020b; NHS Test and Protect, 2020). However, findings from Covid-19 infection
rates across subgroups show that individuals living in socioeconomically deprived areas are
more likely to be exposed to the virus than individuals in less deprived areas (Public Health
Scotland, 2020; Lone et al., 2020; National Records of Scotland, 2021). This means that
children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and family members in their households are
at a higher risk of infection and at a higher risk of self-isolating from school. In other words,
children from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to miss a greater proportion of school
because of Covid-19-related reasons. This, in addition to preexisting socioeconomic gaps in
school absenteeism (Klein, Sosu & Dare, 2020; Klein, Goodfellow, Dare & Sosu, 2020),
exacerbates socioeconomic inequalities in school attendance, and likely, educational
achievement (Sosu & Ellis, 2014). Hence, Covid-19 may not only have increased
socioeconomic achievement gaps during lockdown but may continue to do so via school
attendance disparities when schools reopened.

In our previous research brief on socioeconomic differences in school attendance
(Klein, Goodfellow, Dare & Sosu, 2020), we called to monitor socioeconomic inequalities in
school attendance after the Covid-19-related school closures. Although a UK-wide report
indicates that initial school attendance in Scotland after school reopening was comparatively
high (Sibieta, 2020), it is crucial to monitor the development of socioeconomic disparities in
school attendance after the first Covid-19 lockdown.
This report examines trends in school attendance in Scotland following school
reopening and investigates whether there are socioeconomic differences in school absences due
to Covid-19-related and non-Covid-19 reasons.
Data
For this research brief, we used administrative data on daily school attendance in Scotland after
the school lockdown from 17th August 2020 to 4th December 2020 (last access date: 11th
December 2020). In their Covid-19 weekly updates, the Scottish Government also reports
school attendance data by pupil characteristics
(https://public.tableau.com/profile/sg.eas.learninganalysis#!/vizhome/COVID19SchoolsandChildcareInformation/Introduction). The percentage of pupils attending school
relates to the total number of possible attendances. The data allow us to differentiate between
absences due to Covid-19-reasons and absences due to non-Covid-19-related reasons.
Socioeconomic information was measured using Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation
(SIMD) quintiles with SIMD 1 representing children from 20% of the most deprived areas in
Scotland and SIMD 5 children from 20% of the most affluent areas.
To compare school absenteeism trends with previous years, we used biennial yearly
attendance rates from 2006/07 to 2018/19 (https://www.gov.scot/publications/schoolattendance-and-absence-statistics/). Attendance rates by SIMD were only available from
2012/13.

3

There are three key caveats for interpreting the findings. First, daily attendance data
were only available after the first Covid-19-related school closures, and comparable data do
not exist before the first lockdown. Second, for previous years, data are only publicly available
as yearly averages and biennially. Since our post-lockdown data covers school attendance only
after the summer holidays, it is strictly not comparable to previous annual attendance rates. As
a result, while data inclusion from previous years helps to examine trends, care is needed when
drawing conclusions. Third, the analysis presented includes attendance data for both primary
and secondary pupils because attendance by SIMD was only available for primary and
secondary students combined. Therefore, it is not possible to examine trends in socioeconomic
disparities in school attendance separately for primary and secondary pupils.
Findings
Overall, Covid-19-related and Non-Covid-19 school absenteeism
Trends in overall school absences (Figure 1) indicate that the rate of absence after the first wave
of Covid-19 school closures (average 9.4%) was higher than in previous years (average 6.7%).
Fluctuations characterised trends in school absenteeism throughout the period with increased
absenteeism in the later part of the school term. Interestingly, the school absence rate was
substantially lower in the first week of school reopening compared to previous years (4.6%).
An initial increase in absences during week two and three after reopening may be due to a
cautious approach adopted by schools during the first three weeks in interpreting government’s
guidance that “people who are ill stay at home” (Scottish Government 2020a, p.6).
The decomposition of overall absences post-school closures by Covid-19-related
(average 2.8%) and non-Covid-19 reasons (average 6.6%) in Figure 2 suggests that the
observed increase in overall school absences was due to Covid-19-related reasons. While
constant fluctuations were observed in non-Covid-19-related school absences that are roughly
at the same rate as in previous years, there was a steady increase in Covid-19-related absences
4

after the initial decrease from the peak in weeks two and three (albeit with a slight decrease in
the last weeks). In other words, Covid-19 exacerbated school absenteeism rates for children in
primary and secondary schools in Scotland.

Overall absences by socioeconomic characteristics
The analysis of socioeconomic differences in overall absenteeism indicates that students from
disadvantaged socioeconomic areas were more likely to be absent following school return than
their more affluent peers. By the first week of December when our final data were recorded,
the absence rate for students from the most deprived quintile (SIMD 1) was 21% compared to
about 8% for those from the most affluent quintile (SIMD 5). Socioeconomic disparities were
at its smallest in the first week in August following the reopening of schools (SIMD 1 average
= 8.3%, SIMD 5 average = 4.0%; difference 4.3 percentage points)

Covid-19-related and non-Covid-19 absenteeism by socioeconomic characteristics
There were socioeconomic differences in school absenteeism due to Covid-19-related and nonCovid-19 reasons (Figure 3). While the extent of socioeconomic disparities in absences due to
non-Covid-19 reasons (right-hand graph) fluctuated post-lockdown (SIMD 1 average = 9.8%,
SIMD 5 average = 3.9%, difference 5.9 percentage points), inequalities in absences due to
Covid-19-related reasons became stronger over time. While socioeconomic differences in
absence rates due to Covid-19-related reasons were already existent up until the end of October
(SIMD 1 average = 3.1%, SIMD 5 average = 1.6%, difference 1.5 percentage points), they
grew stronger since the beginning of November (SIMD 1 average = 5.8%, SIMD 5 average =
2.9%, difference 2.9 percentage points). Hence, the risk for students from the most deprived
areas to miss school due to Covid-19-related reasons was twice as high as for students from the
least deprived areas in this period.

Figure 3. Absences due to COVID-19-related reasons and non-COVID-19-reasons by SIMD

To examine whether socioeconomic disparities in school absences after the first lockdown vary
with previous years, we drew a comparison with earlier data on socioeconomic differences in
attendance. Figure 4 shows absence rates by SIMD 1 and SIMD 5 pre- and post-school closures
and the risk difference in absences between students from the most (SIMD 1) and least deprived
quintile (SIMD 5).
The figure’s upper graph illustrates that absences increased for both groups post-school
closure but that the increase was much stronger for disadvantaged students (SIMD 1).
Accordingly, the risk difference (lower graph) increased substantially between 2018/19 (4.9
percentage points) and the observation period post-lockdown (average 7.8 percentage points).
As expected, a socioeconomic gap in absences due to Covid-19-related reasons contributes to
this increase in inequalities in overall absences. However, the lower graph also illustrates a rise
in the risk difference between students living in deprived areas (SIMD 1) and non-deprived
areas (SIMD 5) due to non-Covid-19 reasons post-school closures. In other words, the increase
in inequalities in overall absences is due to socioeconomic disparities in Covid-19-related
absences and an increase in disparities in “conventional” absences. Interestingly, increasing
disparities due to non-Covid-19 reasons compared to previous years are due to an increase in
7

absence rates among students in SIMD 1 and a decrease in absence rates among students in
SIMD 5.

Conclusion and implications
We examined trends in school attendance in Scotland after the first wave of Covid-19 school
closures and investigated whether there were socioeconomic disparities in school absences due
to Covid-19-related and non-Covid-19 reasons. Our findings indicate that overall absence rate
after the first wave of lockdown was about 2.7 percentage points higher than in previous years.
This increase was mainly due to Covid-19 related absences. Non-Covid-19 absence rates were
similar to those in previous years.
Consistent with our expectations, there were socioeconomic inequalities in both Covid19-related and non-Covid-19 school absenteeism. The disproportionate health impact of
8

Covid-19 on those from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g., Lone et al., 2020), and unequal
impact on children’s learning and wellbeing during the lockdown (e.g., Andrew et al., 2020)
extends to inequalities in school attendance after the lockdown.
Socioeconomic disparities in school absenteeism post-lockdown were stronger than in
previous years. This is not surprising given the socioeconomic inequalities in absences due to
Covid-19. However, socioeconomic differences in absence rates also increased for non-Covid19 reasons compared to previous years. This was due to a somewhat higher non-Covid-19related absenteeism among students in the most deprived areas but also due to a lower
absenteeism among students in the most affluent areas. Hence, the latter attended school more
regularly after lockdown than they did in previous years.
From the above presented evidence, we can conclude that the education of children
from disadvantaged backgrounds did not only suffer during school lockdown but was also
adversely affected through more frequent school absences after the lockdown. Given the
detrimental impact of school absenteeism for academic achievement (e.g., Gottfried, 2010), the
consequences for inequalities in educational achievement from these patterns of findings are
likely to be huge. Addressing the disproportionate short- and long-term impact of the pandemic
on the most vulnerable children needs to be at the forefront of the education policy agenda.
Long-term policies that mitigate the detrimental impact of Covid-19 on socioeconomic
inequalities in educational attainment are needed.
When finalising this report, the reopening of schools in Scotland and the rest of the UK
was postponed due to increases in Covid-19 infections. This new lockdown may again
exacerbate socioeconomic inequalities in learning and further alienate children from lower
socioeconomic backgrounds from schooling once they are allowed to go back. There is a need
to closely monitor disparities in children’s learning during this period and post-lockdown
absences. . Notably, the robust evaluation of policy interventions to help mitigate educational

9

inequalities arising from Covid-19 is required. This will also provide insights on the
effectiveness of interventions put in place and the extent to which it mitigates growing Covid19-related socioeconomic inequalities in learning and achievement.
