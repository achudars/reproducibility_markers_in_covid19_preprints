"10" "Abstract"
"11" "Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths and Medicine (STEMM) in Higher Education (HE) were beginning to tackle their lack of diversity. The COVID-19 pandemic has seen the HE sector (including universities, publishers and funding bodies) enter a period of upheaval that risks reversing such progress. This article demonstrates how the unequal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the professional and personal lives of groups currently under-represented in academic STEMM is likely to widen and reproduce systemic inequalities already present within these fields. Evidence emerging from the streamlined COVID-19 related funding call indicates a backward step in gender equity when compared to most recent UKRI figures. The lack of data on other protected characteristics makes understanding and mitigating the damage a significant challenge. We outline specific actions that must be taken to address this challenge, ultimately arguing that academic STEMM must use this time of change as an opportunity to embed policies and practices that place equality, diversity and inclusion at the forefront."
"12" "Introduction"
"13" "The  cracks in the  dominan t  neo-liberal model  of the  UK Higher Education sector   ( Ball, 2012; Gill &  Donaghue , 2015;  Ols s en  & Peters, 2005;  Sutton, 2017;  Enslin  & Hedge, 2019;  Todd, 201 6 )  were becoming increasingly evident  before the COVID-19 pandemic .  The   evidence base  showing  staff and  student  inequality   was growing ,   at best  demonstrating   a failure   to increase  diversity and ‘Widening Participation’, but at worst, showing systematic  career attainment  gaps and  the  under-representation of  marginalised  groups within the sector ( Advance HE, 2020;  Todd, 2016 ;   Adams, 2020;  UKRI, 2020 a ;  IoP  et al., 2019 ; UUK, 2019 ).  Inequalities were being fought on various fronts:   address ing  the replication crisis , moving beyond  journal metrics (DORA ,  n.d )  towards open access,  questioning the peer review process ( Enslin  and Hedge, 2018),  acknowledging  unequal power dynamics between staff   to  tackl e  harassment and bullying  ( Wellcome  Trust , 2020) ,  valorising  teaching work ,  and  shifting  towards  the  recognition of the various contributions  need ed in  the scientific endeavour  (University of Glasgow, n.d. ;  Wellcome  Trust, 2019 ; RSC, 2020 ; EPSRC, 2018 ) .  As we emerge from the COVID-19 crisis, w e  advocate  accelerating changes designed to address  equality and diversity,  rather than  pausing   th ese  initiatives   in the name of crisis management.  We contend that t his crisis presents a real opportunity to reinvent the working practices of academia ,   right  now,  in preference to  control ling  the damage on the careers of under-represented groups down the line."
"14" "We are a n interdisciplinary  group of  UK based  researchers  involved in  two   E PSRC Inclusion Matters  projects aimed  principally  at understanding and alleviating gender disparities in academic STEM  (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths)  careers.  The  visNET   ( EP/S012079/1 )  project develop s  and evaluate s   virtual and remote  networking  and collaboration strategies   to  accelerat e  women ’s careers  in academic STEM. We believe that the strategic use of social network s  and virtual collaborative tools  sh ould be part of improving the retention and progression of women and other marginalised groups in STEM  and  we   aim to  develop best practices for all.  The aims and objectives of our project were already well aligned with other global issues including t he climate agenda and inclusion of colleagues with  disabilities.  For  our project, the sudden move to  entirely  online interaction was  both a n  opportunity and a threat .   T he threat being that gendered and  u nequal practices f rom in person interactions be directly transposed to virtual interactions.  The Evidence Base  ( EP/S012087/1 )  project is tasked with investigating and developing interventions to address the bias in large grant funding  thereby making the “Big Grant Club” more inclusive .  It employs innovative, evidence-based, \"system-level\" methods that leverage diversity to transform our approach to grant funding. Th is  project enhances our understanding of research and grant culture and has devised bespoke interventions designed to tackle the ‘pinch-points’ that contribute to the lack of diversity.   In both projects, emerging findings  have  highlight ed  how  structural inequalities and  systemic bias ha d   the biggest  detrimental impact on the career trajectories of women  prior to the crisis .  S tructural inequalities and s ystemic bias  (both implicit and explicit)  ha ve  also been demonstrated for other marginalised groups in STEMM  (Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths and Medicine) , such as  minority ethnic , disabled and LGBTQ+ colleagues ( Andrews, 2019; EHRC, 2019 ;  Inckle , 2018;  Eaton et al., 2020 , Yoder &  Mattheis , 2016 ,  Schaal , 2018 ).  These marginalised groups do not exist in isolation  – many  academics have overlapping   characteristics ,  creating a prism of identit ies ,   which in turn requires   an intersectional approach to  fully  understand the problem s  of structural inequality and systemic bias  within  H igher  E ducation (HE) ."
"15" "C urrent  evidence   now  suggests  that  the  pandemic h as acted as an amplifie r of  these  existing inequities in academia   due   to  t he unequal  impact  it has had  on  both  the personal and professional lives of groups u nder-represente d within academic STEM M .  Unless this amplification can be halted now, it  likely to  have  a long-term , negative  impact on  equality and diversity within  the sector ."
"16" "Amplification of inequalities"
"17" "Impact on personal life"
"18" "I n the UK ,   women  have been shouldering a large proportion of  the home-schooling and domestic burdens  caused by  lockdown and  the closure of schools and childcare facilities in  response to the pandemic (Andrew et al., 2020 ) .  The concept of the ‘motherhood penalty’  is  already a well-documented and accepted phenomenon in academia (Cech & Blair-Loy, 2019; Mason et al., 2013) .   Our  evidence suggests  that  women  with caring responsibilities , when compared  with  men with caring responsibilities,  are able to spend less time on the professional activities most associated with  career  progression  (grant and publication writing ) . This finding has also been demonstrated in other  recent work   (Ross, 2020;  Shurchkov , 2020,  Viglione , 2020; Connolly et al., 2020)  including   a  study   based  on  a  survey of  4,535   a cademics  across  the US and Europe  (Myers et al., 2020).   Myers   and colleagues  (2020)  established that women with pre-school children were the most impacted  by the move to home working ."
"19" "For many colleagues with a disability or limiting health condition   the experience of the pandemic has been magnified,  particularly for those shielding . The crisis has  ma de   academic undertakings, and even every day tasks, more challenging. Prior to the lockdown, academics with disabilities have often struggled to get the reasonable adjustments required  in their workplace   ( Inckle , 2018 ; DISC, 2020 ) . For those  who  were successful, th ose adjustments   may  have  not be en  transferable to the new home working environment ."
"20" "Additionally,  w hile this has been a time of isolation and worry for most,  for those with underlying mental ill-health,  a lack of  access to the personal and professional networks that can offer social support, mental health and well-being have worsened ( MHF, 2020 ) . T his is likely to have a greater impact on some marginalised groups, such as the LGBTQ+ community,  who are disproportionately more likely to  have  experience d  poor mental health  generally  and be en  more  isolated   during lockdown  ( LGBT Foundation, 2020 )."
"21" "Minority ethnic  individuals  are  also  under-represented within the  HE  sector  ( Advance   HE,  2020 ;  Osho  et al., 2019 ) ,  particularly those from Black ethnic backgrounds, and  in senior  positions (Adams, 2020 ).  Minority ethnic  communities  in the UK  have also experienced a  greater impact of COVID-19 with   statistics showing a much higher death rate  for  people from  Black  and  Pakistani and Bangladeshi   communities  ( Public Health England, 2020 ; Qureshi et al. 2020 ; ONS ,  2020 ) .   Moreover, UK universities  which  employ more B lack,  A sian and  M inority  ethnic (BAME)  staff, have more BAME students, and cater to the needs of these communities ,  are receiving less government support (Morgan, 2020), which may well affect the career progression of  minority ethnic  academics in these institutions. In addition to systemic and institutional racism ( Advance HE, 2020;  Andrews, 2019 ; EHRC , 2019;   T IGER   in STEMM, 2019 ) ,  several reports have highlighted the additional emotional and physical burden for  minority ethnic , and particularly Black, academics due to the pandemic ( Morgan, 2020; Black Minds Matter ; 2020 ) and the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement  ( Boyd, 2020;  Birikundavyi , 2020; Stix, 2020 )"
"22" "The precarity of academic work has also been widely recognised as a b y- product of the increasingly neoliberal academy ( Ivancheva  et al., 2019 ), creating a  culture where researchers  live precariously from  one  short-term contract to  another . These contracts are  the most vulnerable in the midst of  any  financial crisis  (Flinders, 2020)  and, in some cases, have been targeted by institutions  in  pandemic related  redundancy plans  ( Batty, 2020 ) . This  is  also an intersectional  issue , as  women  and  minority ethnic  staff, particularly early career researchers  (Wright, 2020) , are more likely to be employed on precarious contracts  (UCU, 2019) , which , as noted,   elicits  heightened anxiety as research is halted and contracts approach their end."
"23" "These examples are no t  exhaustive,  but it is clear that groups  already  marginalised and under-represented within academic STEM M  are also  likely  to be facing increased challenges outside of work, with those at the intersection between multiple marginalised groups likely to suffer the most in the long and short term .   T hese additional challenges combined with the already existing inequalities in HE  are  impacting the types of work being carried out, widening already present inequalities  ( Myers, 2020 ) ."
"24" "Impact on Academic output s"
"25" "Quantitative data on the direct impact on academic outputs for these groups is limited by the diversity data available to institutions and stakeholders.  However, i nitial evidence from editors and publishers reveals that ,  since the start of the crisis, academics  who are men  are not only submitting more papers than their colleagues, but are also submitting more than the average  in  the same period  last year  ( Pinho -Gomes et al., 2020;  Shurkov , 2020;   Viglione , 2020 ; Frederickson, 2020 ). Beyond the crisis this will have a  long-term effect  on gender differences in publication and citation metrics, and ,  in turn , on the recognition and  rewards that come with this.   Due to  the absence of other diversity data (in all publication studies, authors’ gender s   were inferred by first name),   s imilar data  is not available  for other protected characteristics ,  but  we can  reasonably  expect the trends to be similar considering the demonstrated impact of the crisis .   With an inevitable time-lag, d ata   on  funding application s  and success  rate s  is not yet available but  COVID-19 funding  in the UK  act s  as both an important aspect of the  current  funding  landscape   as well  as a case study to understand who might be applying  and receiving  grants."
"26" "In STEM M , the closing of physical spaces and notably lab oratories  has meant that only researchers  under taking  COVID-19 related work  were able to carry out the full range of their research activities  during lockdown  ( e.g  bench   work and experiment s  were halted for everyone else).   In  the UK  these activities  have been  supported by access to the flexible and responsiv e  COVID -19  funding calls  (UKRI, 2020b) ,  to  accelerated  peer-review publication  processes   ( Horbach ,  2020 )  and   impactful media coverage. Concerns have been raised that the public ‘face’ of COVID-19 research in the media has been dominated by  W hite male academics ( Sweney , 2020; Gharib, 2020) .  Publishing high - impact ,  peer-reviewed articles, successfully securing research funding and generating impact are currently the three most important criteria in  academic   hiring and promotion and therefore researchers involved in COVID-19 work will  likely  see a boost to their career s ."
"27" "We carried out a preliminary analysis of the gender representation of the PIs of published UKRI COVID-19 funded grants  (Table 1) .  It   should be noted that equalities  data  was not  collected  by  UKRI for  proposals  submitted  to the  COVID-19  call  ( Turnnidge , 2020)  T h e data presented here was  collated by th is team of researchers  using UKRI data on successful  CO VID-related  proposals  (UKRI, 2020 b ) .   Of the 351 COVID-related research projects currently funded by UKRI, 30.97% are led by women PIs. This appears a vast improvement on the 19.9% of grants led by women funded by UKRI in 2016/17. However,  a  more detail ed examination indicates  that this value is skewed by the large number of ESRC grants awarded ,  which have  almost  a  50-50 distribution between men and women PIs. Examining the STEMM only research councils (BBSRC, MRC, NERC and EPRSC) only 18.4% of COVID-related research is being led by women PIs  which is lower than   the 2016/17 value of 23. 1 %.  For MRC, which  received  the majority of  STEMM  COVID  research  funding ,  just  23 out of the 121  (19%)  funded grants  were  awarded to women PIs,  meaning  gender representation falls far behind the reported 35.4% for the year 2016/2017."

"77" "Similarly, research by  Adelaine   exposed  the fact  that,  of 4.3 million pounds of research funding awarded to project s   investigating  the  increased  COVID-19 risks among people from BAME backgrounds , no funding  w as  awarded to Black academics ( Adelaine , 2020 ;  Turnnidge , 2020 ).  In  an  open letter  following th at   research, ten Black women  researchers   highlighted the continued exclusion of Black researchers from funding and  academic  research  in the UK   ( Adelaine  et al., 2020) ,   outlining  recommendations for UKRI  regarding  reform ing  their funding practices."
"78" "Considering  t rends in UKRI grant data prior to the pandemic ,  with  application s, awards  and success rates lower for minority ethnic  PIs  (UKRI, 2020 a ; Hussain, 2020 ;  TIGER in STEMM, 2019;  UKRI,  2018 )  and  applications and  awar d s to women  PIs  lower  for  all but  the  AHRC , it  i s clear that the inequalities already present within the system are being inflated .   The overall picture   is  that existing inequalities have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic  due to its unequal impact on the professional and personal lives of under-represented groups,  and this may well have a detrimental effect on the career progression of those researchers  who  were already facing an uphill struggle."
"79" "Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Opportunit ies"
"80" "W hile  the  decrease  in  traditional academic outputs  is likely to be  connected  to the  afore mentioned  personal  challenges faced by marginalised and under-represented groups ,  we  also argue  here  that there will be other factors related to  existing  systemic barriers  (Andrews, 2019; Adams, 2020; UKRI, 2018; Advance HE, 2020) .  W omen  and other STEM M  minorities   might  be at a disadvantage in  this  system in flux ,   in which   network s  and “reputation”  are  key .  For example, men may well benefit more from their networks, particularly in fields where they are  already  over-represented   (Ho w e-Walsh  &  Turnbull, 2016;  Jadidi   et al., 2017) ,  and from the Matthew effect  ( Bol et al., 2018 )  when  secur ing  trust and money from  funders  in pared-down application s .   Further ,   in a patriarchal society,  the  media will reach out and highlight the  research of  people who look  as  the public  envision   an authority figure  in science  ( Carli et al., 2016;  Finson , 2002; Kitzinger et al., 2006) . That figure is likely to be   W hite and male   and is simultaneously likely to  result  in such figures attaining  a  greater ‘research impact’  track record  than their colleagues  outwith  this demographic ."
"81" "Nevertheless, while t he lockdown has signified  a sudden  shift to remote collaborati on  and  net working ,   coupled with  sudden changes in grant application  procedures , w e think  that ,   with the right support and guidance ,  this situation has the  potential  to   create new  and better  opportunit ies  for  groups previously marginalised within the STEM M  community .  Both  our  projects  aim  to  design  interventions ,  informed by  a combination of qualitative and  quantitative research ,  t hat  make meaningful changes to the  existing biases  and imbalances  in academic research culture . The  sudden move to remote working and the  HE  sector ’s  intent , for  the  most part,  to  maintain  the appearance of  “business as usual”  in these conditions   presents  a real threat to equality and  inclusion in  academia.   We suggest  that for  universities and the research community there is  an ethical imperative to  put in place  good practices ,   create new opportunities,  and, at the very least, mitigate any potential discrimination.   This  is   an opportune moment  to mainstream equality and inclusion innovations  such  as   large-scale   redesigning  of  working  practice s at a time when   H igher  E ducation  I nstitution (H EI )  structures  are  more fluid and  amenable to change  than usual ."
"82" "Systemic i nstitutional  responses"
"83" "Leadership"
"84" "There is a high risk that crisis leadership results in equality issues being neglected when they should , instead,  be at the heart of decision making , particularly because cognitive biases are more prevalent in time s  of crisis  when cognitive demands are high  (Fiske & Taylor, 1991)  and future s uncertain . It is more important than ever that management teams are diverse,  and directly informed by  diverse  stakeholder groups  most affected by the pandemic. This means  having E quality,  D iversity and  Inclusion  (EDI)  representatives and those on precarious contracts involved in decision making . It would also, for example, include a  r econsider ation of  how and when meetings are held ,  and  whether  some conversations can be asynchronous  in order  to be inclusive  for  people with caring responsibilities during the day."
"85" "Monitor and  mitigate"
"86" "As a minimum, we call on funders  to monitor grant applications and  to put in place early warning systems  that identify problems , trigger interventions,  and ensure accountability .   In relation to COVID-19 research, we  suggest  it is even more important for funders to monitor the demographics of investigators  who  are both applying and  gaining  fund ing .  This has not been undertaken for the first submissions to the  UKRI COVID call  ( Turnnidge , 2020)  and ,  as can be seen in the research presented above, th ere  has  been  a  negative  impact  on equali ty  within STEMM research councils .   UKRI are collecting equalities data for the second phase of COVID funding however, th ey  will need to rectify the im balances demonstrated in the first phase .  Funders  should consider incentivising the submission of applications from marginalised researchers, n ot least because  the complex scientific problems of today  cannot be solved without diversity of  thought and representation .   In the UK, UKRI opened a short-format, rapid-response grant call to stimulate COVID-19 research.  While this more flexible approach has the potential to attract a more diverse pool of applicants, the analysis above would suggest that this is not currently the case. It is important to continue to scrutinise whether funding is supporting the work of a diverse range of PIs or whether it  remains  preferentially distributed  amongst  already well-funded academics with the ability to  respond  rapidly  by  call ing  on wide  established  networks."
"87" "The  gatekeeping  of grant funding opportunities also happens at a  S chool/ D epartment and  C ollege level s .  Research has  show n  that , in male dominated environment s ,  women are put off by and/or  fare  badly  in  internal selection  processe s  (Ho we -Walsh  &  Turnbull , 2016 ;  Jebsen  et al., 2019 ) .  Hence, w e ask  r esearch  i nstitutio ns  to reach out to academic s  from under-represented groups   to encourage  and support  applications  from  them . This could mean   re-assessing  non-research related workload s or shifting administrative support  particularly to  colleagues   in minority groups,  with  home-related  responsibilities  or  other COVID -19  related barriers ."
"88" "Similarly,   we urge publishers to gather and rapidly communicate data on publication rates by gender  and other protected characteristics ,   possibly  giving the option  for  authors  to  provide diversity data   on submission  (we are not suggesting for this information to be available to the editors / reviewers) ,   and institutions to act on these numbers urgently by offering additional support to  underrepresented  researchers.  This might include editorial support through publication workshops, encouraging collaboration with other successful authors ,  or r equiring justification for single gender author lists or  for  author lists that are lacking in diversity.   Diversity data associated with publication would  support better analysis of the data  and g ender data  c ould  eliminat e  the   binary approach, misgendering mistakes ,  and systemic exclusion of people who cannot be attributed a gender associated with the current methodologies (first names, pictures and pronouns on personal webpages) .  For other  marginalised  groups, it is even more complicated to accurately infer identity and therefore publication analys e s are challenging, which in turns allows for inequities to  persist ."
"89" "Flexible working"
"90" "Access to flexible working has been  both  an official and unofficial uphill battle for many academics and often an important  element  the work carried  out  by Athena SWAN  self-assessment  teams in the UK.    O ur colleagues with disabilities have long fought for changes such as more flexible working and virtual conference attendance (Remnant & Haroon, 2020) .  While the  visNET  project has focused on the role of flexible and remote working and collaboration as a means to overcome gendered barriers to STEM careers.   For many employees ,  regardless of disability  or  health condition, working from home may  offer  the most comfortable and practical environment.  Such changes have now been suddenly forced on the whole community due to the pandemic and t he  COVID-19 lockdown has underscored the power and potential of remote working and highlighted the need to continue more flexible working arrangements beyond the crisis."
"91" "Value  a range of  research activities"
"92" "Grant applications and peer-review ed  articles are not the only way  in which  researchers contribute to the progress and communication of science.   Community activities such as organising research meetings or symposia, science outreach and communication, developing tools and processes for a more inclusive science and learning   require different focus and time constraints than writing long documents. They might be  more manageable tasks  for researchers with competing demands at home while  still  having a wide impact.  In the UK, the  Wellcome   T rust’s “Reimagining Research Culture” campaign  ( Farnetti  &  Wellcome , 2020 )  and the Royal Society’s Resumé for Researchers  ( Catlow , 2019 ) , recently announced as replacing the CV /track record  in UKRI applications (UKRI, 2020 c ),  are examples of efforts by stakeholders to  encourage  reward ing  these activities  on a par with more traditional me asures.   We welcome these initiatives while calling for them to be extended:  there is an opportunity  for  pushing this agenda forward  during this crisis ."
"93" "Measures that have already been deployed by HEIs, attempting to acknowledge the impact of the crisis on staff, such as  removing the requirement for  annual review and introducing a non-detriment policy on tenure track-type progressions, are based on minimal data about the impact of COVID-19 on their workforce. If the types of work undertaken  and outputs currently produced by STEMM academics  are  strongly connected to their demographics , as we  suggest , the risks associated with these measures is that we exit the crisis with two tiers of researchers, those who were able to do work traditionally valued by the sector and those who were not. We argue that recognition and reward (hiring and promotion criteria) be re-focused to acknowledge that colleagues  have been affected in different ways, some with reduced, others with  increas ed  and  most with dramatically changed  work ing practice and conditions .   At the same time, line managers should have individual discussions to establish personal development and career objectives. This is particularly crucial for postdoctoral researchers for whom the job market will be very limited in the aftermath of the crisis  ( Flinders, 2020; Wright, 2020 )  and for whom  developing skills and building their profile will need to be a priority.  UK universities do  not, of course,  operate in isolation, they are affected by external pressures, so  this will require a holistic approach, for example through discussions with the Research Excellence Framework , funding councils, Unions and other  stakeholders."
"94" "As research has been halted, altered and redirected w ith  each researcher’s context differ ing  from the next by a whole range of additional factors usually excluded from the reward and review processes ,  institutions  must be  flexible .  The  Wellcome  Trust have made positive steps  in this direction  by working with researchers on a case-by-case basis to evaluate their  broad  contributions to the sector including mentoring, leadership and public engagement (Bleasdale, 2020). Additionally, the responsibility for such activities has often fallen on those from under-represented and marginalised groups (Wang, 2019; McGuire &  Reger , 2003) meaning that their  re- valuation within HE due to COVID-19 c ould  re - address some of the inequalities within the  current  hiring and promotion system."
"95" "Investment in  Early Career Researchers (ECRs)"
"96" "Researchers on fixed term contracts, many of whom are ECRs, make up a large proportion (70%) of the research workforce in  UK  HEIs (UCU, 2019). Prior to the pandemic, the ECR phase was identified as key point of attrition for women researchers in academic STEM M  ( Shaw &  Stanton, 2012 ;  Lerchenmueller  & Sorenson, 2018 ), with women also being over-represented in more junior posts in these fields. This suggests that a lack of support for ECRs now could have a  significant  and  long-term  negative  impact on gender equity in academic STEM M .  I t is  also  this  same  group of academics who are most at risk of losing their jobs or “ choosing ” to leave  academia  for a less precarious pos ition  as th e  sector ,  and economy ,  hit a downturn ( Flinders, 2020 )."
"97" "Across the sector a range of action has been taken to reduce the financial burden on institutions, such as hiring freezes and a reduction  of teaching  staff paid by the hour and/or on fixed-term contracts . However, these actions are likely to impact ECRs more greatly  than those on secure contracts  and ,  in turn ,  have EDI implications as more women and  minority ethnic  staff are employed on such contracts (UCU, 2019).  Instead, we suggest that universities  invest in early career researcher s by re-deploying staff to other available and suitable work ,  prioritising the  fund ing of  early career fellowships  and support ing   ECRs  with  outputs and  grant and job applications.  The Leverhulme Trust recently announced that they would not just continue to fund early career fellowships  but would increase this funding  to  support  and  encourage HEIs  to invest   in early career researchers (Leverhulme Trust, 2020).  There is also a key role for those managing ECRs, as indicated earlier, to support them to build their own independent networks and career s .   These discussions should  also  require  PIs to be clear about  how  no cost funding extensions, the most common extension to STEMM research grants  since the pandemic ,  are  to be distributed . PIs remain in a position of power  within research institutions  as the distribution of  extension  funding  is  in their hands, with no guarantee to ECRs that  this  will extend their contract s ."
"98" "VisNET   learning: e-networking and collaboration"
"99" "While the  visNET  project focuses on the use of online and virtual tools to develop the careers of women, it also recognised that these interventions could have a long-term impact on the HE sector, making it more inclusive and tackling the environmental crisis by reducing unnecessary travel. As noted earlier, many disabled colleagues have called for remote working and conference attendance for years, yet there remained a reluctance to move online as it was seen as “too challenging”  or detrimental to early career researchers   in terms of networking .  In fact, the preliminary findings of  the  visNET  project  suggest that ECRs , particularly those with children and/or  long-term  health conditions,  are keen to take up  opportunities  to attend conferences remotely  and online networking can reduce  ECRs’  barriers to networking with international and senior colleagues.  The forced move to  remote  working is one key aspect of the crisis that we believe should not be reversed, instead, it  should  be embraced and supported by institutions, individuals and the sector more broadly."
"100" "Online visibility and networking"
"101" "Online visibility and networking  require  both an individual and collective action. While we call on individuals to utilise this time to build their online presence, institutions and organisations must facilitate the development of these relationships."
"102" "The move of many conferences and seminars to online environments  provides  a unique opportunity to network with researchers across the world. Here again, “business as usual” should not prevail and best practices should be investigated, established and upheld beyond the crisis. Meeting and webinar organisers should be more conscious than ever of the gender representation of their speakers. Those with caring responsibilities are calling for seminars to be recorded  with facilities provided  to asynchronously network through platforms such as Slack or Teams in the workplace so that they can tailor their participation around their caring responsibilities. These online environments can also give the space to interact with a wider network of colleagues and break into the ‘old boys club’ networks that have long prevailed within STEM M .  We suggest that for online seminars, post talk questions are not used as a visibility opportunity  but that  anonymous questions  should be used to encourage  the  engagement of all  with  evidence from face-to-face seminars suggest ing  that women attendees are less likely to ask a question if the first question is from a man (Teli s  et al., 2019).  O rganisers should  also consider  provid ing  semi-structured networking opportunities in virtual coffee break s before and/or  after the talk.   Before starting the  project,  the  visNET  ECRs reported  that  there were physical ( impenetrable clusters of  senior  academics ) and mental (anxiety and impostor phenomenon)  barriers  to approaching and connecting with senior academics at conferences .  By assigning a mix of researchers and providing a facilitator,  today’s  networking sessions c ould  avoid the cliques found at conference coffee breaks  and overcome some of the barriers  encountered  at face-to-face conferences .  On  many video conferenc e  platforms there are options to interact either by video or text chat,  options  which can  afford  people’s  networking  preferences ,  so both should be available. We recently  facilitate d  such a coffee break  in which  attendees were invited to share a short biography on a real time feedback  application  and could then use chat facilities to reach out to those with shared research interests ."
"103" "For individuals, a  career-enhancing activity  we  recommend is  to  work on their online visibility by  strategically  updating webpages and social networking profiles. More informally, we would recommend  that  colleagues just reach out to each other. That professor  o r  editor   on the other side of the world whose work you admire ,  invite them to give a talk! Organise Zoom coffees around a theme linked to your research interest and advertise them on Twitter or on  LinkedIn  and if the kids/pets/partners in a bathrobe make a cameo ,  who cares! ?"
"104" "Collaboration"
"105" "The lone genius is now a  mostly  rejected model  in STEMM  research. The re  are more and more calls to recognise and reward breakthrough s  made by teams.  Additionally, c ollaboration is the only way to an equitable exit  from  th is  crisis. It is also an important tool to break isolation, which for certain colleagues  has and will continue to  negatively impact their capacity to work. Examples  show  groups  using collaborative platform s  to  create new world-wide communities in a particular field ( INEF, 2020 ),  prepare systematic review s  and meta - analysis of published data,  write collaboratively,  or to run hackathons  around novel research questions .  For those currently unable to work in the lab, the hackathon structure allows for free-thinking collaboration  to solve  problems  by   applying knowledge to different research areas  or  working with  data  that  is  already  available .  Students at the University of Edinburgh have been involved in a European wide  hackathon  targeting challenges associated with  the impact of COVID-19 on universities, city communities and European co - operation  (University of Edinburgh, 2020).  While on a much smaller scale ,  one of the author ’ s research group s  at the University of Glasgow  ha s  been  engaging  in a hackathon  using data from a previous study in new ways, applying techniques from other areas of chemistry, geology and even social science .   However,  as suggested earlier,  for this to have value for those involved ,  these  non-traditional  activities  must be  valued and  rewarded  within the sector  and within each individual context  in  which they  a re undertaken ."
"106" "Conclusio ns"
"107" "The COVID-19 pandemic has delivered a shock to the  world, including the  academic STEM M  system, presenting it with both a challenge and an opportunity. It has exposed and amplified structural inequalities in academic STEM M . However, it has also forced the community to fundamentally reconsider the way in which it operates .  Here we have  made the case for the community  to grasp this opportunity to develop a more inclusive future for  STEM M   in the  academ y .  It is  particularly  vital that those with the power to enact this change ,   embrace  this responsibility and  that there is a comprehensive approach to making this a success.  There is an urgent need for equalities data to be collected across institutions  and  a warning system  established resulting in  interventions when inequalities become apparent. It seems that in many areas of academic life these inequalities have already been heightened and  we call on  institutions and leaders  to  take immediate action to remedy this.  HEIs   and their leaders  must consider the impact of their  decisions  and policy changes  on staff from marginalised groups  and should seek their views and opinions while accepting that  a single solution is unlikely   to work for  all . Flexibility is  at the crux of  our responses to the pandemic but also at the heart of  innovation and for change to  occur all who are  part of the system must be open to it .  At the individual level, we must utilise the tools available to us, working out what works for  each of us  and our colleagues .  The broader system then must accommodate these changes in ways that are truly inclusive."
