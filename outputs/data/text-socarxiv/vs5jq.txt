Abstract
As a result of COVID-19, many schools switched to online teaching. This move is likely to
benefit advantaged students more because of better access to well-resourced schools and
information technology. We draw evidence from a recent phone survey conducted by Young
Lives in Ethiopia, two states of India, Peru and Vietnam. Logit regression results suggest that
students from a wealthy background in India and Vietnam are more likely to benefit more from
online learning scheme. Rural students in all four countries are significantly less likely to
experience online learning. The disparity in accessing online learning resources may further
reinforce inequalities in achievement in resource-scarce countries.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, most countries around the world have
temporarily closed schools at all levels to contain the virus, affecting around 1.3 billion
learners (UNESCO, n.d.-a). To mitigate the impact on learning, governments in both
developed and developing countries have taken measures such as broadcasting learning
materials on radio and television, distance learning using the internet, audio recording
and phone, a few to mention (UNESCO, n.d.-b). Similarly, many schools have switched
their teaching to online platforms.
These initiatives, however, lack sufficient focus on disadvantaged communities
with limited access to internet and electricity, especially in developing countries.
Research has already documented that higher-income areas in the US with better
internet access and fewer rural schools engaged more with online learning resources
during the pandemic (Bacher-Hicks, Goodman, & Mulhern, 2020). This may lead to
widening learning achievement gap between higher and lower social classes. This study
aims to shed light on this issue by enquiring—who benefits more from online learning
tools by educational institutions in four developing countries. We use recent household

phone survey data from Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh [AP] and Telangana State
[TS]), Peru and Vietnam collected by Young Lives (YL) (Favara et al., 2020).
Data and Methods
Data
YL collected household survey data between 8 June and 12 July 2020 via phone.
The study includes people aged between 5 and 26 years old who are also reportedly
active learning through educational institutions. YL COVID-19 is part of a longitudinal
survey which started in 2002 to analyze the causes and consequences of poverty in the
selected four countries. Data were collected using sentinel-site sampling design to
select 20 sites in each country with a ‘pro-poor’ bias. Rich households were also
selected to draw valid comparisons. While poor families are overrepresented in the
sample, previous YL analyses suggest that YL data show proximity of wealth
distribution and diversity to nationally representative surveys such as Demographic and
Health Survey (DHS) (e.g., Escobal & Flores, 2008).
Variables
The outcome variable in this paper is the dummy online learning indicating
whether someone’s study has been switched to the online platform. There are originally
three categories in this variable—yes, no, and not applicable (learning/study is not
relevant). The observations belonging to the ‘not applicable’ category are dropped to
keep the study focused on those attending schools or universities.
The independent variables are gender, ‘wealth’, urban-rural location, age and a
state dummy for India (AP or TS). ‘Wealth’ is a dummy variable measured by six
indicators including household possessions of certain items, the quality of the house,
number of people, water source and sanitization facilities. The variable is originally
coded as Home Environment for Protection (HEP) which was constructed to indicate

the household’s wealth level (Favara et al., 2020). Age is used to control for grades as
it is not available in the dataset. See Appendix A1 for summary statistics.
Modelling
We use the following logistic regression model equation (1) to estimate the
association between different sociodemographic factors and the beneficiaries of online
learning. Here,
I = logit(P)ij = β + δWj + αUj + ϕZij + εij

(1)

I is a binary outcome variable indicating whether the learning has been switched to
online or not, β is an intercept, δ is the coefficient on wealth W of household j and α is
the coefficient on whether the household belongs to urban or rural areas Uj. ϕ is a vector
of coefficient on control variables Zij—gender, age, age squared and state only for India.
εij is an error term. Standard errors are adjusted for household clusters in all models.
Findings: Who Gains from Online Learning?
Before explaining findings on the disparity in learning through online platforms,
we demonstrate that the studies of poor and rich, and urban-rural people were equally
likely disrupted by the pandemic. The coefficients for both groups in each category are
not significantly different (see Figure 1). However, have they equally benefited from
alternative methods of learning? This is discussed below.
[Figure 1 about here]
As Figure 2 suggests, in India and Vietnam, rich people were significantly more
likely to benefit from online learning schemes compared to poor people (p<.001). In
Ethiopia, the difference is also noticeable but not statistically significant. The difference
is not significantly different in Peru either. Since our estimate of ‘wealth’ uses proxy
measure instead of income and occupational class, the results may be limited in
showing a robust picture of wealth disparity. However, we also use the urban-rural

dimension to allow exploring the disparity further. Rural people may have limited
access to facilities and public amenities that urban dwellers regularly enjoy.
[Figure 2 about here]
As figure 3 illustrates, the disparity in learning through online platforms is very
wide between urban and rural people. In all four countries, urban dwellers are
significantly more likely to experience using online platforms for studies than rural
inhabitants.
[Figure 3 about here]

Discussion
Access to basic learning infrastructures and facilities is a significant challenge
for underprivileged communities in many low-income countries. For instance, rural
people are largely disadvantaged accessing internet in most of the selected countries in
the study (see Appendix A3). Online teaching in educational institutions in the current
crisis period is sometimes seen as a panacea to solving learning problems. However, in
absence of proper instruments for the poor and marginalized population, the learning
gap will widen at an ever-increasing pace as some groups will have all the means to
continue learning and others simply will not. This paper gives a snapshot of disparity
at the early stage of the pandemic which may gradually intensify. Online learning for
deprived communities should, therefore, be prioritized in the budget to account for any
future crises.
