"14" "Abstract"
"15" "Background"
"16" "Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) combine  the impact  of morbidity and mortality ,   allowing for comprehensive comparisons of the population . The aim was to estimate the DALYs due to Covid-19 in Malta (March 2020-21) and  investigate its impact in relation to other causes of disease  at a population level."
"17" "Method s"
"18" "Mortality and weekly hospital admission data were used to calculate DALYs, based on the European Burden of Disease  Network  consensus Covid-19 model.  Covid-19 infection duration of 14  days  w as  considered. Sensitivity analyses for different morbidity scenarios , including post-acute consequences  were presented."
"19" "Results"
"20" "An estimated 70,421 people were infected  (with and without symptoms)  by Covid-19 in Malta (March 2020-1) , out of which 1,636 required hospitalisation and 331 deaths, contributing to  5,478 DALYs.  The se  DALYs positioned Covid-19 as the fourth leading cause of disease in Malta. Mortality contributed  to  95% of DALYs, while post-acute consequences contributed  to  60% of  morbidity ."
"21" "Conclusion"
"22" "Covid-19 over one year has impacted substantially the population health in Malta. Post-acute consequences are the leading morbidity factors that require urgent targeted action to ensure  timely multidisciplinary care.  I t is recommended that DALY estimations in 2021 and beyond are calculated to assess the impact of vaccine  roll-out and emergence of new variants ."

"25" "Introduction"
"26" "The  outbreak of  novel coronavirus SARS-CoV - 2 has been a global pandemic since early 2020  (1) . The small European state of Malta reported its  first  Covid-19 case on the 7 th  of March 2020   (2) . The first Covid-19 wave was well controlled in Malta, with  a relative ly  low mortality rate and a total cumulative positive cases of 108 per 100,000  (3) . The second Covid-19 wave initiated  in  mid-Summer  and this saw  a high mortality and admission rates to hospital   (4,5) .  The positivity and mortality rates were constantly high  until   mid-March 2021, where another instituted lockdown curbed the community spread   (6) .  Up till the end of March 2021, 6,562  positive cases per 100,000 population have been reported with 88 deaths per 100,000 population   (2) ."
"27" "Burden of disease  assessments  allow the estimation of a disease impact on a population by measuring the morbidity and mortality attribution and presentin g it through a single metric called  disability-adjusted life years  (DALYs)   (7) .  Morbidity  occurrence  is translated through the estimation of years lived with disability (YLD) following the adjustment for the severity and the disability suffered due to a disease or injury. The mortality counts due to the disease or injury, are translated into estimates of years of life lost to premature mortality (YLL), using age-conditional life tables.   DALYs are estimated by the combination of YLD and  YLL   (7) .  T his metric is a popular way  used  to assess the health impact at a population level and  then  translated as  evidence  to influence national policy makers."
"28" "The aim of this study was to estimate ,  for the first time ,  the direct impact of Covid-19 on the population of Malta  for the first  year  (March 2020-2021) . We  also set to investigate  the likely  Covid-19 impact in relation to other causes of disease and injury, at a population level."
"29" "Methods"
"30" "Data"
"31" "Covid-19 mortality data between March 2020 and March 2021  were  recorded from the daily Covid-19 bulletin s  issued by the Malta Ministry of Health  (2) . However, mortality data did not differentiate from those dying with Covid-19 from those dying due to Covid-19 , in line with WHO recommendations on assigning underlying cause of death   (8) ."
"32" "The Covid-19  positive cases were sub-divided according to the different health states, as shown in Table 1,  based on   the European Burden of Disease Network and the European Centre of Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)  Covid-19  consensus  disease  model   (9) .  Daily positive case numbers have been reported by the Malta Ministry of Health from the onset of the pandemic in Malta  (2) . However, d ata on the  different  health states of  the  Cov id-19 positive cases were provided on a weekly basi s , every Friday,  from the 7 th  of August 2020, following the initiation of the second wave in Malta  (5) . Prior to this period, the Covid-19 situation was well controlled  (3,10) .  Hence, weekly Covid-19 health states   were not publicly provided  excep t for the monthly intensive care unit  (I C U  – c ritical cases )  admissions due to Covid-19   (11) .  Therefore, e stimations  for  the  hospitalized Covid-19 cases ( non- I C U ,   i.e.,   severe  cases )  from March to July 2020 were performed . An assumption was made that the proportion of Covid-19 admissions to  hospital  in August in relation to the total positive cases (not requiring I C U) was the same  as that  throughout March to July 2020.  It was  hence  assumed that 1.3% of the Covid-19 cases not admitted to the I C U ,  required admission to a hospital ward   i.e.  were   ‘ s evere ’   cases ."
"33" "Considering that in Malta a high swabbing rate and efficient contact tracing ,  up to secondary contact ,  has been in effect  from the onset of the pandemic , it was  noted  that 20% of the  reported  positive cases  ( not requiring hospitalisation ,  i.e.,  moderate  cases )  were actually asymptomatic  (3,5,12) .  Hence, for this study’s analyses,   a reduction of 20%  from  the moderate cases was performed .   However, the literature indicates that a proportion of Covid-19 will not be picked up through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing   (13) .  Based on this, we have estimated that cases represent 80% of all infections, so have upscaled our estimates to reflect this to estimate the total number of asymptomatic and symptomatic infections. Additionally, it has been noted that  approximately  20% of reported cases were actually  a symptomatic  (3,5,12) .  To reflect this, we have also reduced the number of moderate cases by 20%, since by virtue of requiring healthcare assistance, any severe or critical cases would be symptomatic. Therefore, we estimated that  asymptomatic cases represented a total of 36% of all cases as follows: ( i ) 20% of all cases are asymptomatic and not reported (ii) 20% of the reported cases (80%) are asymptomatic  i.e.  16% of all cases ."
"34" "Analyses"
"35" "The modelling approach  applied  by this study to calculate the Covid-19 DALYs was based on the European Burden of Disease Network and the  ECDC  consensus  disease  model  (9) ."
"36" "YLL  was estimated  by combining the death counts by five-year age-groups and sex.  The estimates were calculated by multiplying the number of deaths in each age-group by the  age-conditional remaining life expectancy from the  G lobal Burden of Disease (GBD) Study  2019  reference life table , where the same values are assigned to both males and females   (14) ."
"37" "The symptomatic duration of 14 days was  considered  for each health  state  (critical, severe, moderate),  following local and international reported durations of Covid-19  infection r espectively  (15,16) .  Person-years were calculated as the sum of cases for each symptomatic health  states  ( critical, severe, moderate ), multiplied by 14, divided by 365.25, reflecting the contribution of individual days to a complete year.  This was  carried out  since DALYs use a year as the unit of time.  An estimate of the post-acute consequence (long-Covid) YLD  was calculated ,  where  it was assumed that 13.3% (one in seven) of the total Covid-19 patients ( symptomatic  and  asymptomatic ) would suffer from long-Covid for  a duration of  28 days   (17) .  The disability weights used for each health status was derived from the European Disabil ity Weight Study (EDWS) and  GBD 2019, as shown in Table 1   (18,19) ."
"38" "YLD w as estimated by  multiplying  person-years  of infection with the  disability weight for each health status  (as per Table 1) .  The disability weight’s uncertainty levels (UI) were also considered to measure the upper and lower limits of the YLD.  DALY s were then calculated through the summation of YLL and  YLD.  The upper and lower limits of the DALYs were also calculated based on the UIs of the YLD."
"39" "Our   estimate of   Covid-19 DALY s was compared to the 2019 leading ranked causes of  disease and injury  for Malta , using estimates from GBD 2019.   (20)"
"40" "Scenario  analyses"
"41" "A number of uncertainties were present in our analyses especially when  estimating  YLD .   T he health  state  case numbers were not available prior to August 2020  (except  for  I C U on a monthly  basis ) .   W hen  health  state  data was  available ,  the cases were a snapshot  of  one particular day (Friday).  Another uncertainty was the proportion of cases that suffered from post-acute Cov i d- 19 consequences. Thus, in order to quantify the impact of these uncertainties, sensitivity analyses were performed.  S ensitivity analyses w ere performed on the moderate cases and the post-acute consequences, since these were  likely the most uncertain estimates . The sensitivity analyses assessed for the  effect of an increase in moderate cases by 10%, 25% and 50% on the DALYs.  We also assessed  the effect  of  different transition probabilities from an acute to post-acute consequence  have on the DALYs ,  when considering  all  Covid-19 cases and  then  symptomatic cases only.   Finally,  different scenarios were assumed with half or double the duration of post-acute consequences  and different proportions of moderate cases, in order to minimise and maximise the YLD ."
"42" "Results"
"43" "Over the course of a year (March 2020 – March 2021), an estimated 70,421 people were infected by Covid-19 in Malta , both with and without symptoms.  When considering the symptomatic cohort and taking into the account the duration of the  Covid-19  infection ;  for an infection duration of 14 days, this reflected 1,570 person-years.  These generated a YLD of 93, as shown in Table 2.  Out of the  three   health   states , the moderate symptomatic cohort translated the most to the symptomatic YLD.  Post-acute consequences  were  estimated to have affected 9,366 patients with a contributing YLD of 157 , if symptoms persist ed  for 28 da ys.  Out of the different health states, post-acute consequences had the highest impact  on YLD while the severe cases  had the lowest impact on YLD.  The mortality for this time period was of 331  deaths , contributing to 5,229 YLLs."
"44" "It was estimated that the DALY s  due to Covid-19  were  5,478.  The highest contributor factor  to the DALYs w as  mortality, with YLL representing 95% of the DALYs  with 16 YLL per Covid-19 death ."
"45" "On comparing the  DALYs  for the top-ranking diseases and injuries  as reported by  GBD 2019  for  Malta  to th is study’s  estimated Covid-19 DALY s , it was noted that the Covid-19 DALY ranked fourth , after  ischemic heart disease (13,594 DALY s ), low back pain (7,106 DALY s ) and  diabetes  (5,796 DALY s ) ,  but  before stroke (5,096 DALYs) ."
"46" "Scenario  analyses"
"47" "A number of different  sensitivity analyses, which varied  assumptions  on  moderate  cases  (symptomatic community) and post-acute consequences  health statuses  were performed  to evaluate their impact o n  DALYs , as shown in Table 3.  Additionally, a combination of assumptions  was  performed to minimise and maximise the impact of YLD, with a range of 115 to 3,606  (Table 3) .  The different defining scenarios involving the post-acute consequences and the combination assumption maximis ing  the YLD, led to a higher estimated DALY tha n  that estimated for Malta 2020.  However, only when maximising the YLD, did the DALY represent a  higher-ranking  position for the cause of  disease and disability  for Malta , from  initially  placing  fourth to second leading cause of d isability."
"48" "Discussion"
"49" "Summary"
"50" "DALYs due to Covid-19 in Malta were likely to have had the fourth largest population health impact relative to other diseases and injuries for 2020. The majority of the population health  loss was due to mortali ty as it represented 95% of  DALYs with 16 YLL per Covid-19 death.  On comparing to the Scottish Covid-19  BoD  study, our study’s mortality contributed to a lesser percentage to the DALYs than Scotland, where the la t ter reported mortality to contribute to 98% of DALYs  (21) ."
"51" "In our study, m orbidity was driven mostly by post-acute consequences, followed by symptomatic community cases (moderate). Indeed,  when maximizing both post-acute consequences and moderate cases, the estimated DALY exceeded the impact of Covid-19  from fourth  to the second leading cause of disability in Malta.  Therefore, although Covid-19 individuals that require hospitalisation, with or without intensive care support, have a considerable ill-health impact, the post-acute consequences, also called “long-haulers”  might  pose the largest cumulative impact on the population health , although this follows a degree of uncertainty .  This finding corresponds with the S cottish Covid-19  DALYs estimate  although different time periods were considered in this study (21) .  Nevertheless, it needs to be noted that following a comparison analyses between a Malta national burden of disease study for low back pain (LBP) to the GBD LBP estimates for Malta, it was concluded that the GBD overestimated the LPB burden   (22) . Hence,  it is likely that the Covid-19 DALYs estimated in this study may place at a higher-ranking position than fourth leading cause of disability in Malta."
"52" "Strengths and weaknesses"
"53" "The YLL  calculation was  based on the  national  reported cases  (hospital, nursing homes and private residence deaths)  that died while with Covid-19. Distinction was not made between those that died with Covid-19 or due to Covid-19 .  Since the onset of the pandemic, a ll  death s  at hospital  (even if initially negative for Covid-19),  were  tested for Covid-19  post-mortem   however, deaths in private residents  were not  unless suspected by relatives  that the deceased might have had Covid-19 .  This is more likely to have overestimated DALYs due to C ovid- 19, however this is counter-acted by the fact that deaths from early in the pandemic would have been less likely to have been identified as dying with Covid-19.   The validity of the mortality estimate is furthermore supported by recent information on excess mortality. Compared to 2019, there have been  317  more deaths in 2020, which is in line with the number of report ed   Covid-19  deaths.  Furthermore , caution needs to be put forward when comparing our study results to other Covid-19 burden of disease studies according to the mortality definition considered for the DALYs estimation."
"54" "The aspirational life table was used to calculate the YLL in order to facilitate comparative research considering that Covid-19 is a global issue , although acknowledge that this choice is an area of intense debate   (23) ."
"55" "All admissions to hospital were tested for Covid-19, with PCR testing repeated if any symptoms develop during the patient’s stay or the patient need ed  to undergo an invasive procedure. Hence, the Covid-19 pick up rate for in-patient cases was efficient.  However, hospital data was only freely available on a weekly basis from August.   Although assumptions had to be made for this time period, acute YLD is very small in relation to the YLL and so the impact of these assumptions will be minimal. However, one cannot dismiss the possibility that the assumptions might have led to overestimations or underestimations for some cases."
"56" "At a community level, a high swabbing rate has been implemented from the very start of the pandemic in Malta with contact tracing up to the second contact of an infected person   (3) .  Therefore, Covid-19 positive  cases, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic,  were picked up at an early stage of the disease.  Based on the  literature  it was assumed that the total Covid-19  population consisted of an additional 20% Covid-19 asymptomatic individuals that were never picked up   (13) .  However, this was an estimated proportion originating from the literature and does not necessarily reflect the local undetected Malta cases, hence we cannot exclude the possibility  of overestimations  or underestimations of this asymptomatic cohort."
"57" "The disease model to calculate the health loss due to Covid-19 morbidity was based on the  European Burden of Disease Network and ECDC  consensus method , which was adopted for both prevalence- or pathogen- based YLD calculations  (9) .  Meaning that any future presenting long-Covid conditions such  as respiratory conditions,  will be   attribute d  to their relevant non-communicable diseases through  prevalence  data."
"58" "In our calculations, the post-acute consequences were based on assumptions since long Covid-19 remains largely uncertain and different entities provide different  definitions  and dur ations   (24,25) .  Indeed, the  scenario  analyses were performed to try out a number of different assumptions and scenarios, while evaluating the corresponding DALYs.  However, since the YLD contributed to only 5% of the DALYs, fluctuations in post-acute consequences had a great er  impact on DALYs  only  when maximizing the  YLD  health status  outcome.  It is recommended that further research is performed on post-acute consequences to have a better understanding on  the progress of this condition."
"59" "Implications for research and policy"
"60" "Covid-19 has bestowed a substantial burden upon Malta’s population health. This study estimates the  direct  impact of Covid-19 in Malta and not the impact of lockdowns or implemented mitigation measures instituted throughout the duration of this pandemic. From our analyses it could be observed that Covid-19 presented as a novel disease in March 2020 ,  however  over  one year it became the fourth leading cause of disability among the population. The burden of disease methodology used assessed for both the direct and indirect impacts of  Covid-19. Indeed, it was clear that the largest morbidity impact of Covid-19 was arising from post-acute consequences. Although this is still an unknown territory, where even the definition is still debatable  (24) , it is clear that those that become ‘long haulers’ are attributing to higher DALY and inevitably will have a higher burden on the healthcare system. Therefore, it is recommended that further research on long Covid-19 is conducted at a national level. Additionally, long Covid-19 should be  considered as an urgent  public health  matter  with engagement of a multi-disciplinary service to provide targeted healthcare service to this sub-population."
"61" "Since the end of December 2020, Malta, has been administering Covid-19 vaccination to the population through a priority system  (26) . Indeed, up to the time of writing (3 rd  May 2021), Malta has the fastest vaccination roll-out within the European Union (EU), with 25% of the total  eligible  population fully vaccinated and 54% having had the first dose  (2) . Covid-19 vaccination is considered as the tool to tackle Covid-19 infection. Hence it is recommended that DALYs estimations are measured periodically during 2021 and beyond to determine the vaccines ’  impact on the population, as well as determine the effect of emerging variants."
