Abstract
This one-group pre- and post-test quasi-experimental study endeavored to investigate whether learner autonomy
was developed with implementing language-in-talk log assignments as a monitored self-study task in a university
English conversation course (890-020 English Conversation). Eighty-eight Thai second-year undergraduate
accounting majors at Prince of Songkla University (PSU), Hat Yai, Thailand took part in the study. The participants
completed 10 language-in-talk log assignments over 10 weeks. A pre- and post-questionnaire was administered
before and after the intervention to examine the effect of the log assignments in developing participants’ learner
autonomy. The reflective log was also used to gather participants’ perceptions of using the log assignments in a
conversation course. The results showed that the language-in-talk log assignments aided in enhancing the students’
learner autonomy to set learning goals, select appropriate learning materials, take responsibility, and evaluate their
learning. Seeking social assistance, however, did not have a significant difference in mean scores, and participants
expressed dissatisfaction over not being able to interact with their peers as in classroom learning. The findings
further highlighted the significance of teachers’ presence in scaffolding learners to achieve full autonomy. Overall,
the results from this research supported the use of the log assignment as a potential pedagogical tool to enable
learners to be responsible for their own learning in a language course.

Introduction

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the normal functioning of schools and universities across the world has been
disrupted. According to the United Nations (2020, p.2) statistics, “nearly 1.6 billion learners in over 190 countries
and all continents have been adversely affected by the pandemic”. To ensure the continuity of learning, many
educational institutes have turned to online teaching, requiring teachers to move to online delivery of lessons in a
brief span of time. This has resulted in a dramatic shift of learning from face-to-face to the distinctive rise of e-

learning, whereby teaching is undertaken remotely on online or digital platforms. According to Anderson (2011),
learning and teaching in an online environment are quite similar to teaching and learning in any other formal
institutional setting where learners’ needs are analyzed, content and learning activities organized and learning
assessed. However, while the shift to online teaching has averted the congregation of students to decrease the risk
of COVID-19 spreading and enabled flexibility of teaching and learning, the rapid transition to online instruction
has confronted teachers and students in most contexts, including Thailand with unprecedented challenges.
Aside from specialized delivery technologies, learning design is vital for successful online teaching. Hodges et al.
stated that “effective online learning results from careful instructional design and planning, using a systematic
model for design and development” (2020, p.3). Before the pandemic, many educational institutions in developed
countries were already offering distance education and online courses with a good success rate (Anderson, 2011).
Such educational institutions have invested enormous time and effort to plan and develop their instructional design
with quality learning materials, appropriate media, and technology for course delivery to serve the aim of online
teaching and learning. However, developing countries like Thailand did not have the luxury to go through such a
rigorous process of designing and developing the online course as emergency remote teaching (Hodges et al.
2020). It was introduced within a short time span because of COVID-19. The overnight transition from the
classroom to online teaching has therefore led to a hybrid of traditional and online teaching where teachers use the
same pre-defined materials to teach via different technological mediums instead of face-to-face delivery (Rapanta,
et al., 2020). Clark (1983, as cited in Anderson, 2011) argued that technologies served mainly as a medium of
instruction but it was the instructional design built into the learning materials that had a significant influence on
student achievement. For effective online teaching, learning materials must be designed properly to engage the
learner and promote self-directed learning, notwithstanding the advantage of the flexibility of delivering the lesson
online.
However, in the wake of the COVID-19 situation, teachers had to prepare and deliver lessons from home and make
the transition from traditional classroom teaching to online teaching instantaneously without proper technical
training. One major challenge for university teachers has been their lack of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK)
(Shulman 1987, as cited in Rapanta, et al., 2020) needed for teaching online. Consequently, teachers have faced
difficulty in designing online learning materials properly with learners and learning objectives in focus, and an
instructional design that provides adequate support to the learners. Therefore, designing lessons with the balanced
amalgamation of high authenticity, high interactivity and high collaboration (Ring & Mathieux, 2002, as cited in
Anderson 2011) for meaningful online learning experience has proven a challenge for most teachers.
In addition to appropriate learning design, learner autonomy is an important attribute for successful distance
learning or online teaching. Idealistically, learners are assumed to have developed a degree of autonomy for selflearning and self-motivation for online learning. Realistically, many learners may not have developed adequate
autonomy for self-regulated learning. For instance, Asian learners are often described as passive and reluctant to
openly challenge teachers’ authority (Pierson, 1996, as cited in Chang & Geary, 2015). Lo (2010) found that Asian
EFL students were less aware of the concept of autonomous learning and hardly participated and contributed to
the process of creating knowledge. Similarly, within the English as a foreign language (EFL) context of Thailand,
Rukthong (2008) and Meesong and Jaroongkhongdach (2016) found that although Thai EFL learners were positive
about autonomous learning, they were not ready for autonomous learning. Their excessive reliance on teachers’
instruction, low level of English proficiency, and inadequate learning strategies to take control of their learning
were some of the factors impeding their engagement in autonomous learning. Therefore, during such uncertain
times where face-to-face interaction seems unlikely in the near future, teachers are challenged to channelize a
mechanism to provide adequate scaffolding and formative guidance to students with different degrees of autonomy
for effective online learning. Learners, on the other hand, are finding it difficult to navigate through the content of
the lesson and stay motivated to “apply, assess, analyze, synthesize, evaluate, and reflect on what they learn”
(Anderson, 2011, p.33).
Along with learning design and learner autonomy, assessment has been a major challenge in online teaching.
Anderson (2011) affirmed that “effective teaching presence demands explicit and detailed discussion of the criteria
by which student learning will be assessed” (p.352). Research on assessment has shown that providing feedback

to students on their performance is effective in motivating learning, shaping behavior, and developing mental
constructs (Shepard, 2000, as cited in Anderson, 2011). Thus, assessment plays a critical part in facilitating online
teaching and encouraging autonomous learning among students. Unlike classroom teaching where teachers interact
with students on a daily basis, online teaching is isolated. Accordingly, formative assessment such as selfreflections, learning logs, and portfolios are recommended. Furthermore, asynchronous activities or tasks as part
of the students’ learning process is also suggested as an alternative assessment tool to create teaching presence
(Rapanta, et al., 2020).
Given this shift into the virtual classroom and intensified reliance on autonomous learning of course content with
online materials, the current research examines how the use of learning and assessing tools such as language-intalk log assignments can aid Thai EFL learners’ autonomous learning of English conversation during COVID-19.
According to Moon (2010), the log assignment is a pedagogical tool primarily used to enhance L2 learning beyond
the classroom as it can accentuate favorable conditions for language learning, encourages independent learning,
and supports metacognition. Therefore, the main question to be addressed in this paper is to what extent log
assignments help Thai EFL learners with their self-study or autonomous learning of English conversation during
COVID-19.

Literature review

In this section, pertinent literature on use of log assignments as autonomous learning and assessment tools and the
role of technology in autonomous language learning are reviewed to lay down a conceptual framework for the
study.
2.1. Log assignment as an autonomous learning and assessment tool
For the purpose of this paper, a log assignment, also referred to as a learning log, is a pedagogical tool which
provides learners a place to keep a record of their learning process along with their reflection on learning activities,
instructional methods, and learning experiences. Students and teachers predominantly use a learning log as a
learning and assessment tool. The log allows students to express, examine, and explore their learning experiences
and provides teachers the ability to assess the progress of the students and give them feedback (Rickards, 2002).
Furthermore, Lee (1997) asserted that a log has a dual purpose for students. Firstly, it acts as a personal record of
learners’ preparation and effort to learn, their reflection on their interpretation, and their extension and
reformulation of knowledge. Secondly, it served as the source and place of their self-evaluation as they used the
log to evaluate their own strategies and effort to learn. Thus, a learning log has been beneficial in creating an
environment where learners can freely record, evaluate, and examine their work and learning.
Furthermore, an asynchronous task such as a log assignment has been recommended by researchers as an
assessment tool to motivate and regulate students’ online learning. Assessment from the instructor's perspective
involves “getting to know our students and the quality of their learning” (Ramsden 2003, p.180, as cited in
Garrison, 2011). However, because of COVID-19 instructors are continuously engaged in synchronous online
teaching and are deprived of face-to-face oral or written examination. Therefore, monitoring students’ progress on
a daily basis might be challenging considering the workload imposed by the emergency shift to online teaching.
The role of an instructor is not only to deliver lessons but involves providing constructive and meaningful
assessment feedback to help students develop the metacognitive skills and strategies to take responsibility for their
own learning (Garrison, 2011). Log assignments are a formative assessment which enables instructors to make
self-regulation part of the assessment. By contrast, the summative assessment such as standardized tests with
minimal feedback leads to memorization and a surface approach to learning. The log assignment encourages
students to have dialogue, receive richer forms of feedback, and deeper modes of learning (Entwistle, 2000, as
cited in Garrison, 2011). A log assignment facilitates the development of self-assessment and reflection in learning.
In addition to facilitating and assessing language learning, in the EFL context, a log assignment is essentially used
as a medium to promote autonomous learning. According to Litzler (2014), in writing logs, learners write
information and reflections on various aspects of their learning, such as their reactions to a lesson and the

600

methodology used, out-of-class activities carried out to learn English, and other aspects of the learning experience
related to a specific language course. Lee and Cha (2017) found that the use of listening logs for extensive listening
in a self-regulated environment not only developed learner autonomy among participants, but yielded learners’
growth in their ability to summarize, express feelings, and improve English proficiency. A log assignment is a
potential tool to develop learner autonomy as students take responsibility for their learning, evaluate their progress,
and reflect on the effectiveness of the teaching and learning process beyond the classroom learning environment
(Chang & Geary, 2015; Litzler & Bakieva, 2017).
Previous studies revealed that learners’ participation in out-of-class activities through a log assignment
demonstrated their willingness to become autonomous learners as well as enhancing autonomous learning. Chang
and Geary (2015) investigated the effectiveness of using self-assessment learning logs to promote the autonomy
of L2 learners in Taiwan. The participants completed the self-assessment learning log entry on a biweekly basis,
reflecting on their out-of-class activities to improve their English. The results indicated that the learning logs were
effective in promoting learners’ autonomy, and students viewed learning logs favorably. Similarly, Litzler and
Bakieva (2017) examined students’ views on using learning logs in foreign language study to develop learner
autonomy. The results showed that students were generally positive about the learning logs as it helped them
increase autonomy while working with English outside class, created self-awareness about learning strategies, and
equipped them with new ways of learning a language. Litzler (2014) concluded that a log assignment is worth
implementing in foreign language classes because students have a positive view of learning logs and it makes a
significant contribution to the development of learners’ autonomy.
2.2. Role of Technology in Autonomous Language Learning
In recent years, the concept of learner autonomy has become prevalent in foreign language learning due to the
pedagogical shift in teaching language to communicative language teaching (CLT), which encourages students to
engage and take charge of their learning actively (Hafner & Miller, 2011; Luzón & Ruiz, 2010). Although the
definitions of learner autonomy differ, there has been a significant degree of consensus among researchers that
autonomy involves learners taking more control over their learning (Benson, 2011). Holec (1988) defined learner
autonomy as the ability to take control over one’s learning and Little described it as a “capacity for detachment,
critical reflection, decision-making, and independent action” (1991, p. 4). However, owing to the diverse and
multiple interpretations of autonomous learning, language teachers are often left bewildered in deciding to
implement the autonomous approach in the pedagogical process.
Although the term learner autonomy has various definitions and interpretations, Benson (2011) claimed that
language learner autonomy differs in degree, indicating that amateur learners are capable of developing autonomy
and that the intensity of autonomy ranges from lower to a higher level. Furthermore, previous studies unanimously
agreed that learners might be at different stages of becoming independent or autonomous learners (Nunan, 1997).
Hammond and Gao (2002) found that Chinese learners had a low level of autonomy, as they tended to listen and
follow teachers’ instructions. By contrast, Western learners participate and contribute to the process of creating
knowledge. Thus, "autonomy is not an absolute but a relative term, and the degree of autonomy may vary from
one context to another" (Farmer & Sweeney, 1994, p.138).
While the degree of autonomy may vary depending on the context, researchers claimed that new technologies are
now providing opportunities for EFL learners to learn a language beyond the classroom, thereby transcending
geographical limitations. Benson and Chik (2010) stated that emerging online platforms provide a conducive
environment for autonomous language learning. More importantly, the use of technology in language teaching and
learning fosters learner autonomy by providing learners with easy access to a range of resources, tools, and
environments for out-of-class learning (Benson, 2011). Benson and Chik (2010) reported on English language
learning histories of two Hong Kong users of English as Foreign language in ‘globalized online’ space designed
for video, image, audio and text sharing, who credited their high-level proficiency to interaction with their
preferred media and with other members of the virtual community. Similarly, Murray’s (2008) study on Japanese
informal English learners also revealed that exposure to ubiquitous English language pop-culture led to great
improvements in English despite their lack of interest in English as a school subject. Cole and Vanderplank (2016)

601

Asian Institute of Research

and Sockett (2014) investigated how the growing affordance of new technology fostered learner autonomy and
improved learners’ English proficiency. They found that it enabled significant numbers of independent, informal
learners in foreign language contexts to achieve a high level of proficiency.
While technology offers myriad opportunities for autonomous language learning, it is not without constraints.
According to Holec (1998, as cited in Bailly, 2010), motivation, and accessible online resources are not adequate
conditions to make autonomous learning possible or easy for students, whose learning process is driven by the
social promotion of teaching and heteronomy over learning and autonomy. Researchers maintained that autonomy
is essentially an idea from Western culture that values independence (Schmenk, 2005 as cited in Chik, Aoki, &
Smith, 2018); collectivist Asian EFL learners may find the concept difficult to incorporate into their learning. Lo
(2010) revealed that Asian EFL students were less aware of the concept of autonomous learning and they tended
to view learning as an end product rather than a process. Several researchers (Doyle & Parrish 2012; Guo 2011;
Inozu, Sahinkarakas, & Yumru, 2010) have examined the readiness of EFL learners for autonomous learning.
Their studies disclosed that while EFL learners had a positive view of autonomous learning, they lacked basic
premises of learner autonomy such as learner control, ability to make decisions, the capacity to take responsibility
of one’s own learning and skills to critically evaluate one’s own progress (Little, 2004).
Regarding Thai EFL learners, Bruner, Shimray and Sinwongsuwat (2014) noted Thai students’ dependence on
their teachers, and their lack of willingness to take control of their own learning due to low English proficiency
(Rukthong, 2008). Therefore, it might be difficult for Thai EFL learners to easily become fully autonomous. In
the Thai EFL context, Thai students might benefit from ‘reactive autonomy’ as a preliminary step towards
proactive autonomy. In an autonomous learning activity, proactive learners are self-initiated and have more control
over learning. By comparison, reactive learners are responsive to a task and teachers help to formulate a direction
of learning to which learners will react by choosing preferred strategies, materials, and goals (Littlewood, 1999).
Although Thai EFL learners may not have developed adequate autonomy for self-regulated learning, the pandemic
has left no alternative than to embrace online learning. Consequently, learners have no choice but to make drastic
changes to their learning approach to suit the new learning environment.
Therefore, considering the teaching and learning approach mandated by COVID-19, it is imperative to develop an
efficient instructional design by integrating learning tools such as log assignments to foster learner autonomy. An
appropriate student-centered pedagogy should be developed by considering the advantages of specific technology
for autonomous language learning and its implication for learners (Schwienhorst, 2007 as cited in Hafner & Miller,
2011). Developing autonomy involves a teacher’s guidance and three main pedagogical principles: 1) learner
involvement, 2) learner reflection, and 3) target language use in the development of language learning autonomy
(Little, 2004). Accordingly, this research adopted the premise that a language-in-talk log assignment mandates
extensive learner involvement, including the requirement for students to choose their own material, take
responsibility for their choice, and reflect on their learning in the target language. This is facilitated by a teacher’s
guidance and weekly feedback. The goal of this study is to demonstrate whether the use of language-in-talk log
assignments help students to be responsible for their own learning as part of self-study monitored by the teacher.

Research Methodology

3.1. Participants
A total of one hundred (N=100) non-English major students taking an elective English course (890-020 English
Conversation) at the Faculty of Liberal Arts, Prince of Songkla University (PSU), Hat Yai, Thailand in the second
semester of the academic year 2020 participated in the study. The students represented different academic majors,
including Accountancy (n=94), Chemistry-Biology (n=1), Animal Science (n=4), and Agro-Industry Technology
Management (n=1). Participants were selected using a purposive sampling method and to ensure participants’
homogeneity, 94 students from the Accounting major who completed pre-requisite courses (890-002 Everyday
English and 890-003 Fundamental English Reading and Writing) or have O-NET scores over 50 were considered
as the principal participants of the study. However, data was collected from only 88 students (n=88), due to their
absence in either the pre- or the post-questionnaire.

3.2. Data Collection Procedure
3.2.1. Intervention
Language-in-talk log assignments
The language-in-talk log assignment was integrated as a monitored self-study task in the conversation class and
all participants received an explicit orientation on the specifics and structure of the log assignment at the beginning
of the course. Each week the participants selected and watched two to three-minute long online video clips of
English speakers’ natural or near-natural conversations containing language actions such as greeting and
introducing, leave-taking, expressing gratitude, making requests, offers and suggestions, and giving and
responding to compliments and opinions. During the task, participants were also required to fill out a worksheet
(see appendix A) asking them to specify the source of their listening materials, verbatim transcribe, and write a
summary of the conversation describing its main goal, setting, and the relationship between speakers. To complete
the task, they also needed to reflect on what they learned from the conversation concerning how a particular action
is carried out through talk, what kind of language is used to get the action done, as well as how the use of the
language is shaped by the interactional context. Participants submitted 10 log assignments over the course of 10
weeks.
3.3. Instrument
3.3.1. Questionnaires
A pre- and post-questionnaire was administered before and after the intervention to examine the effect of languagein-talk log assignments in developing participants’ learner autonomy. The questionnaire consisted of two parts.
The first part was designed to collect the participants’ demographic information, including their gender, English
language proficiency, and other related information. The second part investigated the participants’ autonomous
learning capacity. The questionnaire was developed based on five common characteristics of learner autonomy:
setting up learning objectives, having the right to decide learning content, willingness to take responsibility,
making an evaluation on what had been acquired, and seeking social assistance (i.e., teacher and peer support and
assistance) (Holec, 1988; Morrison, 2011). A five-point Likert scale was used to indicate the degree of agreement
of respondents and the questions were available in both English and Thai.
Table 1: Values of Cronbach’s alpha reported for five dimensions to measure learner autonomy

603

Asian Institute of Research

To ensure validity and reliability, Cronbach’s coefficient α was used to calculate the internal consistency
coefficients of the items included in the questionnaire through a pilot study with 49 non-English major students
taking an English course at the Faculty of Liberal Arts, PSU. The questionnaire was analyzed using SPSS.
Cronbach α scores greater than .70 were considered as indicative of acceptable reliability (Tavakol & Dennick,
2011). For the overall reliability, the Cronbach’s alpha value was .911. The internal consistency reliabilities of
each dimension were .735 for setting learning goals, .736 for selecting the content, .892 for willingness to take
responsibility, .755 for evaluating one’s learning, and .775 for seeking social assistance. The results for the
reliability coefficient suggested that there was an acceptable level of internal consistency for the five dimensions.
Thus, the overall reliability of the questionnaire was very high and the r-value for each dimension was at an
acceptable level, implying that the questionnaire was reliable to assess the learner autonomy of students.
3.3.2. Reflective Logs
At the end of ten weeks of language-in-talk log assignments, open-ended questions were used to allow students to
reflect upon (1) using the log assignments as a self-study task during COVID-19, (2) the effectiveness of the log
assignments in developing their learner autonomy and (3) challenges and opportunities afforded by the log
assignments in the conversation course.

Results

4.1. Questionnaire Results
4.1.1. Learner Autonomy Development
To answer the research question concerning whether language-in-talk log assignments helped learners with their
self-study or autonomous learning of English conversation during COVID-19, the data was collected from closedended questionnaires and reflective logs.
Participants completed a 34-item pre- and post- closed-ended questionnaire in which they rated their status of
learner autonomy before and after doing language-in-talk log assignments as part of monitored self-study in the
conversation class. Items were rated on a five-point Likert scale. The mean differences in their pre- and postratings showed that overall participants developed learner autonomy and grown in all the five dimensions (1Setting learning goals, 2-Selecting the content, 3- Willingness to take responsibility, 4-Evaluating one’s learning,
and 5-Seeking social assistance) after doing language-in-talk log assignments over one semester. The overall
improvement in participants’ learner autonomy and the extent of the growth in each dimension is represented in
the graph below.

Table 2: Independent paired t-test- students’ learner autonomy

As shown in Table 2, the independent t-test results suggested that overall, there were statistically significant
differences in the mean scores of pre- and post-questionnaire responses of participants (p=0.00<0.05), indicating
that the participants developed learner autonomy after the implementation of the language-in-talk log assignment
as part of monitored self-study in the course. Their ratings on the five dimensions of learner autonomy also
improved in respect of mean scores. Statistically, the average mean scores of setting learning goals, selecting the
content, willingness to take responsibility, evaluating one’s learning and seeking social assistance obtained after
doing log assignments (x̅ = 3.82, x̅ = 3.96, x̅ = 3.93, x̅ =3.73, x̅= 3.85 respectively) were, in general, considerably
higher than those obtained before doing log assignments (x̅ = 3.61, x̅ = 3.66, x̅ = 3.72, x̅ =3.56, x̅ = 3.74
respectively). It was clear that there was significant growth in the mean scores of all the five dimensions of learner
autonomy after the intervention. Therefore, it can be inferred that the language-in-talk log assignments helped
learners with their self-study or autonomous learning of English conversation during COVID-19.
Paired sample t-tests were run to determine whether the differences between the mean rating for each dimension
before the intervention differed from the mean at the end of the intervention to a statistically significant degree.
Specifically, p-values of setting learning goals, selecting the content, willingness to take responsibility were .00,
and evaluating one’s learning (p=0.01) denoting that there were significant differences in the mean scores for
dimensions 1, 2, 3, and 4 either at p< 0.01 or. p < 0.05. This shows that students felt they had developed in all of
these areas at a significant level after the intervention. The only exception was with the fifth dimension ‘seeking
social assistance’ with p=0.05, which did not achieve statistical significance. One explanation for this outcome is
that because of COVID-19 and the dramatic shift from face-to-face learning to online learning, and adhering to
mandatory social distancing rules, there were fewer opportunities to seek social assistance from friends and
teachers.
Table 3: Dimension 1: Setting learning goals

605

The results of the t-test showed that overall Dimension 1 (p=.00) had significant differences at .01 level (see Table
3), implying that participants’ ability to set up one’s learning objectives and study plans improved after doing the
log assignments. This was found to be true for items 1(p=.00), 2 (p=.01), 4 (p=.00), 6 (p=.00) signifying that the
students felt they had improved in formulating learning goals, and planning and analyzing learning tasks and
requirements to achieve the objectives of the course. The exception was with item 3 (p=.17) and 5 (p=.07), which
did not achieve statistical significance. This is likely because of a ceiling effect, as students’ ratings were initially
high in the pre-questionnaire and did not change significantly in the post-questionnaire. A majority of the students
entered the course with some knowledge of setting the learning goal for each semester. Therefore, their high preratings left little room for growth in their post- ratings.
Table 4: Dimension 2: Selecting the content

The p-value for Dimension 2 of the Learner Autonomy Questionnaire was .00, which showed that there was a
significant difference between mean scores of pre- and post-questionnaires at 0.01 level. As shown in Table 4,
except for item 9 with p-value 0.22, items 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12 have significant differences either at 0.01 or 0.05
level. The average mean scores of all the six items in post-questionnaire (x̅ = 4.31, x̅ = 4.01, x̅ = 3.86, x̅ =3.85, x̅=
3.63, x̅= 4.13 respectively) were higher than those obtained in pre-questionnaire (x̅ = 4.07, x̅ = 3.55, x̅ = 3.70, x̅
=3.64, x̅ = 3.15, x̅ = 3.88, respectively). Considering the mean values shown in Table 4, it can be understood that
the participants’ perspective of selecting the content for their own learning developed after doing the log
assignments for one semester. The post-mean scores of items 7, 8, 12, related to using online resources such as
YouTube videos, films, TV shows and sitcoms beyond the classroom or in their own learning time, were
significantly different from the pre-mean scores. Although the post-mean scores for item 9 increased, its p-value
at 0.22 demonstrated that participants were not entirely confident in having full control over choosing materials
for doing the assignment despite their fondness for exploring online resources such as YouTube videos, films, and
other resources.

Table 5: Dimension 3-Willingness to take responsibility

Table 5 indicated that the p-value for Dimension 3 of the Learner Autonomy Questionnaire was .00, showing a
significant difference at the 0.01 level. All the nine items achieved increased average mean scores in the postquestionnaire compared to the pre-questionnaire. The p-value of item 13 (.01), item 14 (.01), item 17(0.1), and
item 18 (.00) showed that students were willing to take responsibility for their own learning by formulating
directions of learning, sharing responsibility with the teacher, analyzing materials, and keeping a record of their
learning. However, item 15 (.19), item 16 (.15), item 19 (.05), item 20 (.40), and item 21 (.07) had a higher pvalue (p>.05) showing that despite obtaining high mean scores in the post-questionnaire there was not a significant
difference between pre- and post-mean scores. This shows that participants’ readiness to embrace complete learner
autonomy was at the initial stage, as they were skeptical about their capability to learn on their own with no
scaffolding and guidance from the teacher. Specifically, items 16, 19, and 21 suggested that students were not
confident about their ability to learn and assess their own learning without the teacher support.

The p-value of the participants’ responses for Dimension 4 of the Learner Autonomy Questionnaire was .01,
showing a significant difference between the mean scores of pre- and post-questionnaires at 0.05 level.
Statistically, the average mean scores of the eight items in post-questionnaire (x̅ = 3.72, x̅ = 4.34, x̅ = 3.35, x̅ =3.52,
x̅= 3.60, x̅= 3.69, x̅= 3.69 x̅= 3.93, respectively) increased compared to those gained in pre-questionnaire (x̅ =
3.45, x̅ = 4.23 x̅ = 3.15, x̅ =3.26, x̅ = 3.42, x̅ = 3.50, x̅= 3.66, x̅= 3.77 respectively). Item 22, which focuses on
students’ dependence on teachers for evaluation, had a statistically significant mean difference (p=.02).
Nonetheless, it appears that the implementation of log assignments as part of the monitored self-study task in
conversation class helped the participants to reflect and monitor their own learning while doing the log
assignments. It is apparent from Item 25 ‘I have my own ways of testing how much I have learned from log
assignments’ and item 27 ‘I evaluate whether my process of doing log assignments was effective or not in
improving conversation skills’ that participants developed their approach to evaluating learning after doing the log
assignments as both the items achieved a significant difference of .02 and .03, respectively. Furthermore, the fact
that there was no significant difference between the pre- and post-mean scores of items 23 and 24 (.18 and .10,
respectively) revealed that participants were gradually becoming autonomous in evaluating their work without
much reliance on the teacher.
Table 7: Dimension 5: Seeking social assistance

Table 7 showed that the p-value for Dimension 5 of the Learner Autonomy Questionnaire was .05, suggesting that
there was no significant difference between the mean rating for each item before and after the intervention. Only
item 31 had a significant difference with p-value .01, showing that students sought help from their peers to do
assignments. However, items 30, 32, 33, 34 (p-value=.48, .20, 10, .37 respectively) did not have a significant
difference; specifically, the mean scores of items 30 and 34 in post-questionnaire (x̅ =3.72 and x̅ 3.76 respectively)
decreased compared to pre-questionnaire (x̅ = 3.81, x̅ = 3.86 respectively). The decrease in the post-mean scores
of items 30 and 34 might be because of the shift of learning from face-to-face to online learning due to COVID19. Students learning online lacked the opportunity to meet with friends for interactive discussion. This was in
contrast to the classroom learning environment, which provides students with opportunities for collaborative
learning such as group discussion and pair work. Although the mean scores for items 32 and 33, associated with
students’ dependence on instructors’ assistance and feedback, are statistically insignificant (.20 and .10
respectively), both items obtained higher mean (x̅ = 3.91, x̅ =4.28,) in the post-questionnaire than in prequestionnaire (x̅ = 3.76, x̅ = 4.10,). Participants’ rating for item 33 was high both before and after the intervention,
suggesting that instructors’ help and feedback was still an important aspect in developing autonomous learning in
students.

Results from Reflective Logs

5.

At the end of the intervention, participants submitted a reflective log containing open-ended questions, which
elicited their experience of doing language-in-talk log assignments as part of monitored self-study tasks in a
conversation course amidst COVID-19. The reflective log was mainly used to collect additional information about
the effectiveness of log assignments in developing their autonomous language learning. The results suggested two
major themes involving participants’ development in learner autonomy (e.g., setting goals, selecting content,
willingness to take responsibility), and the importance of the teacher’s presence.
5.1. Autonomous Language Learning
The 88 participants of the study agreed that the language-in-talk log assignments enhanced their autonomous
learning of English conversation during COVID-19 and unanimously responded ‘Yes’ to Question 3 ‘Did the log
assignment help you with your self-study or autonomous learning of English conversation during COVID-19? If
yes, how? If no, why? (see appendix B). These responses on the use of log assignments in relation to the
development of autonomous learning corroborated the findings of the closed-ended questionnaire which also
indicated that overall, the participants developed learner autonomy after implementing the language-in-talk log
assignments as part of monitored self-study in a conversation course. The following are the comments provided
by students in their reflection: The students’ comments were not edited by the researcher for errors in grammar.
-

-

Yes, I think log assignment helped me with my self-study. Because when I did log assignment, I had to
search for data by myself and I can do it anywhere such as house or dormitory. This is the great idea for
learning English during COVID-19 with social distance policy and take advantage of my free time.
Yes, I think log assignments can help me to learn on my own because when doing log assignments, I
have to research and analyze resources to do the issues by own. I can do assignments right from home.
Which is suitable for learning during COVID-19. It's a good solution.

When asked whether the log assignment motivated them to look for more resources for improving their English
conversation skills, all the participants reported that it stimulated them to search for more resources to facilitate
their learning experience. The following excerpts demonstrated how log assignments prompted participants to
look for more information:
-

-

In this semester, I associated with English language better than ever, therefore I was interested in looking
for more resources apart from YouTube. I have one new resource for improving my English conversation
skills, which is a channel podcast in Spotify. I listen to podcast in my free time and repeated after
podcaster has spoken.
Log assignment can motivate me to look for more resources for improving my English conversation skills.
Because when I heard the conversation from the VDO clips it made me feel like I want to speak English
better. I try to figure out the meaning of words that I don’t know or understand and I try to listen to VDO
clips or watch movies in English.

Apart from being a stimulus to search for more resources, the log assignment also developed participants’ capacity
to select their own content and material for learning. Participants were optimistic about their experience of
selecting materials for doing the log assignment, and expressed their interest in choosing materials of their choice
and exploring the resources at their own pace. The following statements reflect the students’ perception of greater
learner autonomy:
-

-

It makes me enjoy studying. I can choose the video that I am interested to study, so it made me
concentrate on log assignments and I was able to focus fully on assignments.
I enjoy doing log assignments as a part of the self-study task. I can choose the movies that I like for
easier transcribing and I already know how a particular action is carried out through talk.

Furthermore, one of the essential components of autonomous learning is self-assessment and evaluating one’s
learning process, which enables learners to undertake more responsibility in identifying their weaknesses and
strength. As can be inferred from participants’ reflections, log assignments seemed to have developed participants’
ability to assess their own learning. Participants expressed the following statements in their reflection:
-

-

Log assignment made me realize what parts of my skills are lacking and where I need to improve.
When I first got this assignment, I wondered if this was the assignment of communicating English. Why
isn't there more speaking practice? Which from this work is quite a lot of writing for me? At first, I
wondered what the advantages were but after working on this assignment, I started to enjoy it even more.
It is a task that I have developed skills in grammar, vocabulary, critical thinking, discussion.

However, the findings of the reflective log suggested that log assignments did not aid in promoting social
engagement and collaboration. This echoed the questionnaire results, which also revealed that of the five
dimensions of learner autonomy, only the fifth dimension ‘seeking social assistance’ did not achieve statistical
significance. Seeking social assistance is an important scaffolding activity to promote learner autonomy. However,
due to COVID-19 and the shift from face-to-face to online learning with social distancing, there were few
opportunities for interactive tasks and collaborative discussion. The following statements reflect participants’
desire for peer work or face-to-face interaction with their friends and teachers:
-

-

I think my studies and assignments during COVID 19 can improve conversational skills at a level less
than teaching in a normal classroom. Because teaching and learning in the classroom, there is more
discussion and exchange between teachers and students than online learning. But doing a record
assignment each week helped me practice my listening skills and to see examples of the conversations I
encountered often in everyday life from the clips I studied. But in terms of improving conversational skills,
I think I haven't been able to get enough of my speaking skills. Because during COVID-19 I was unable
to go out and meet people and practice communicating in English.
I prefer studying in the classroom. Talk to teachers and friends. When you have questions, you can ask
the teacher immediately. But this online study has put me in charge of researching the various topics of
the assignment. I think I have practiced a little conversation skill because during COVID I studied online
and rarely got to meet people.

5.2. Teacher Presence
Participants’ reflective logs unveiled that teacher scaffolding gave students necessary guidance in doing log
assignments. They admitted that the teacher’s weekly feedback on log assignments encouraged them to do better
and be actively engaged in completing the task on time. This attitude aligned with questionnaire item 23 ‘Every
time I have an assignment, the teacher should score or correct it’ and item 24 ‘I do the log assignment only when
my teacher is going to grade me’. Mean scores of both items increased after implementing log assignments in the
conversation course. Participants’ comments revealed that they appreciated the support received from the teacher.
For example, participants wrote:
-

-

…… when I got the feedback and mark for the log assignment, it makes me want to do the next log
assignment better. I want to get good feedback and mark. So, I will search for more resources for
improving my English conversation skills.
At first, I did not like to watching movie but when I finish my work and got best word from teacher, it
made me want to do next log assignment. I think teacher’s good advice help student to open their mind
with English. Someone did not like English but they got good advice from their teacher, it made them like
English.

Having feedback from teachers made me not feel lonely when studying this subject. Teacher motivate me
to submit work.
The enjoy part of the self-study task is when I receive scores and comments for the past log
assignments. I enjoy developing my skills from the comments each week to improve the work and get
better scores every week.

While participants relatively improved learner autonomy after doing log assignments, some students still preferred
having explicit instruction from their teacher and wanted the teacher to provide standard material to all students:
-

-

6.

I need teacher to give a video clip for each log assignment, because sometimes it’s unfair with someone
who don’t like to watch English movie cinema or cartoon. I think teacher should provide a fixed video
clip for each log assignment for everyone, in order to be fair with everyone.
Assigned work, I think it is good. But I think I should be taught more in detail about the use of notation
in transcription. And explain various topics for better understanding so that students can understand
and can search for more direct clips.
Discussion

The current study aimed to examine the effectiveness of using language-in-talk log assignments as part of
monitored self-study in developing learner autonomy of Thai EFL learners during COVID-19. The results
supported previous studies regarding the use of log assignments as a pedagogical tool to promote autonomous
learning (Chang & Geary, 2015; Duong & Seepho; 2017, Lee & Cha 2017; Litzler & Bakieva, 2017). Overall, the
findings of the closed-ended questionnaire and reflective logs disclosed that the participants developed learner
autonomy after implementing language-in-talk log assignments in the conversation course. Statistically, the
questionnaire results showed a significant effect of using log assignments on participants’ post-mean scores.
Students' ability to take charge of their own learning improved, as they became capable enough to formulate
learning goals, choose what to learn, select appropriate learning methods, and evaluate their learning process and
outcomes. Holec (1988) defined learner autonomy as “the ability to take charge of one’s own learning” (p.3). The
findings from reflective logs revealed that the log assignments helped in developing students’ learner autonomy.
Their ability to select learning materials, make decisions, and act independently developed. Based on the results
of the study, language-in-talk log assignments aided in enhancing the learner autonomy of students during this
unprecedented time of the global pandemic. The findings suggest the value and potential of exploiting log
assignments as a teaching and learning tool for both instructors and learners in the EFL context.
However, data analysis showed that despite the overall development of learner autonomy, there was not a
significant difference between mean scores of the fifth dimension ‘seeking social assistance’ before and after the
intervention. The decrease in post-mean scores of items 30 and 34 indicated that the log assignment did not really
offer students a platform for learner interaction and collaboration. Firstly, due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
educational institutions around the world have been forced to depend on emergency measures by switching to
online learning from face-to-face learning and adapting to the new normal by adhering to social distancing
protocols. This shift to online teaching has enabled flexibility of teaching and learning, but drastically reduced
social interaction; that is the support from teachers or peers in the language learning process (Rapanta, et al., 2020).
Consequently, restrictive social communication channels such as student-student and student-teacher interaction
for discussion and practical activities amidst COVID-19 might have affected the possibility of seeking help from
peers.
Secondly, the log assignment was designed as an individual self-study task. The structure and requirements of the
assignment might not have promoted peer discussion and collaborative learning. Rovai (2002) asserted that the
delivery medium is not the determining factor in the quality of learning per se; rather, the content and instructional
strategy in the learning materials determine the learner’s achievement (as cited in Anderson, 2011). Accordingly,
further investigation is needed after incorporating an interactive task into the current structure of a log assignment

611

to see the impact of collaborative learning on learner autonomy. Anderson argued, “as learners work through the
content, they will find the need for learner support, which could take the form of learner-to-learner, learner-toinstructor, instructor-to-learner, and learner-to-expert interactions’’ (2011, p.33). Apparently, the interactive task
does not solely promote social engagement and collaboration. Rather, it depends on student’s ability to take
initiative in seeking social assistance if they could not learn in isolation but had to collaborate and interact with
others in autonomous learning (Cui, 2012 as cited in Cheng, 2019). Therefore, the design of a log assignment and
a student’s willingness to collaborate could have influenced their decision to seek social assistance during the
learning process.
The findings of this study are in line with other research studies that claimed that the teacher’s feedback and roles
are important in the development of students’ autonomous learning (Kim, 2014; Lee, 2016; Yunismar, 2019).
According to Little (2007) to foster learner autonomy, the teacher plays a prominent role in facilitating, monitoring,
and evaluating the learning process. This explains the increased post-mean scores of items 32 and 33 of the
questionnaires. Furthermore, providing timely feedback is considered as “an integral part of the online teacher’s
function of facilitating students’ learning” (Anderson, 2011, p.352). Findings from the reflective log revealed that
students needed the teacher’s weekly feedback, which motivated them to submit better log assignments. Although
autonomous learners ought to be analyzing their learning needs, selecting appropriate approaches, evaluating their
learning process, Morrison (2011) argued that scaffolding from teachers is essential as autonomous learning need
not be a secluded activity, but rather a collaborative experience to achieve learners’ goals. Teachers’ support and
assistance are quintessential in the promotion of learner autonomy among students.
7.

Limitations to the Study

All the participants were considered an experimental group in this one-group pre- and post-test quasi-experiment
design. Having a control group whereby participants are taught the same conversation course as the experimental
group but without having to complete weekly log assignments might have offered a wider perspective on the
effectiveness of using language-in-talk log assignments as an autonomous learning tool. Secondly, the log
assignment did not incite much collaboration or peer interaction between the learners. Adding a task where learners
can exclusively work in pairs or groups using different communication technologies might have provided adequate
scaffolding to facilitate learning.
Apart from these limitations, the findings of this study attested to the potential for using language-in-talk log
assignments as a teaching and learning tool in the EFL context. Gradually, educational institutions were moving
toward online delivery, both on campus and at a distance (Anderson, 2011). However, due to the COVID-19
pandemic, schools and universities around the world, and in particular in developing countries like Thailand,
grappled with significant challenges of urgent and unexpected transition from face-to-face learning to online
learning. The concerns raised by UNICEF (2020) regarding the rapid shift of learning from the classroom to online
learning were that the students might not have developed sufficient autonomy for self-learning. There was a lack
of mechanisms for teachers to assess and provide feedback and formative guidance to students. To address these
concerns, teachers can use language-in-talk log assignments as a pedagogical tool to facilitate autonomous learning
and assess student’s progress for meaningful learning.
Conclusion
This paper investigated the effectiveness of using language-in-talk log assignments in enhancing autonomous
learning of Thai EFL learners during COVID-19. Findings from the statistical analysis and themes that emerged
from reflective logs reaffirmed that autonomy is a universal human capacity (Little, 2007). Asian learners can
enhance their learner autonomy with proper training and pedagogical tools in place. The results confirmed that log
assignments developed students’ ability to take charge of their own learning in terms of setting learning goals,
selecting appropriate learning materials and methods, and evaluating their own learning. Since learning is the
product of social interaction, the findings from the study also highlighted the importance of teacher support and
collaboration with peers. Both are vital for learners to achieve full autonomy in the language learning process.
