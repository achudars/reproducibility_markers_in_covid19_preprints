Convalescent plasma therapy holds promise as a transient treatment for COVID-19. Yet, blood products are important sources of
HIV infection in low- and middle-income nations. Great care must be taken to prevent plasma therapy from fueling HIV epidemics in
the developing world.

The COVID-19 pandemic has inspired rapid research towards
medications and vaccines to prevent the spread of the disease.
Many drugs have been promoted as potential treatments for the
disease, including hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, Remdesivir,
Avifavir, ivermectin, chlorine dioxide, among others1. Their
effectiveness has been based on small studies and massively
inﬂated by the media, only to later show limited to no beneﬁt in
larger studies and, sometimes, even cause severe side effects. The
reality is that, to date, there is no proven drug to treat COVID-19. A
potential vaccine will take at least 1 year to be developed and
tested. Yet, a promising strategy to hold down the fort has arisen:
convalescent plasma therapy. Trials to treat COVID-19 using this
method are being initiated in many countries, including low- and
middle-income nations in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin
America.
Convalescent plasma therapy is based on the concept of
passive immunity. Individuals who recover from SARS-CoV-2
infection have, in principle, developed neutralizing antibodies
against the virus2. Collecting plasma, the liquid component of
blood, from someone who has recently recovered from COVID-19
and infusing it into someone with an ongoing infection would
confer the plasma recipient with antibodies to combat the virus3.
Of note, this is an immediate transient treatment and does not
replace the long-lasting immune memory generated by a vaccine.
Indeed, high-afﬁnity IgG antibodies have a half-life of up to three
weeks in blood4. Nevertheless, the hope is that the infusion of
convalescent plasma enriched in antibodies will substantially
boost the recipient’s immediate immune response to clear
the virus.
The infrastructure for collecting and administering plasma
exists. The risks are known and rather low when the healthcare
infrastructure is optimal. More than 16,000 patients at hundreds of
US hospitals have received convalescent plasma therapy for
COVID-19. A study in New York City found that convalescent
plasma recipients had improved survival and less-supplemental
oxygen requirements than control patients3. Yet, convalescent
plasma therapy is not without its perils, especially in low- and
middle-income nations with suboptimal healthcare infrastructures
and less strict regulations. Blood transfusions can transmit bloodborne pathogens5 and lead to conditions such as transfusion-

related acute lung injury and transfusion-associated circulatory
overload6. In fact, blood transfusions have been shown to
represent an important source of HIV infection in many lowand middle-income countries, being associated with positive HIV
status7. It is unlikely that most low- and middle-income countries
will be able to secure the blood supply by universal HIV testing7.
Even when funding is provided, access to medical materials and
supplies in the international market remains difﬁcult for the
developing world8.
For years, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
and the World Health Organization (WHO) have subsidized
molecular testing in the developing world. One such program,
the introduction of “all-in-one cartridge” systems for RNA sample
isolation and PCR-based testing, has been used for HIV and
tuberculosis diagnosis9. This technology has recently been
approved for COVID-19 testing, although with signiﬁcant delays
in the delivery of reagents and supplies10. Importantly, this
platform has a higher cost and lower throughput than other PCRbased approaches. It allows the processing of only up to four
samples per run, severely limiting its utility for COVID-19 and HIV
PCR-based testing in larger communities. Moreover, governmental
laboratories with RNA testing capabilities are currently saturated
in many low- and middle-income countries11, leaving administrators to decide between testing for COVID-19 or HIV.
Regulations worldwide have forbidden paid organ and tissue
donations for decades. Yet, these measures remain far from
effective, particularly, in the developing world12. The reality of
plasma donations is similar. In Bolivia, for instance, although law
1716 forbids any kind of payment for tissue donation, advertisements requesting paid plasma donations are common, even in
prime time TV and national newspapers13. Such strategy is likely to
be successful, as media coverage has been shown to positively
impact organ and tissue donation rates14. Some regions have
circulating lists of infected individuals. Plasma donations are
compensated with thousands of dollars, several times the local
average monthly salary, and can be performed once a week.
Patients who recover following convalescent plasma infusion are
then encouraged to donate their plasma. In addition to
resembling a pyramid-type scheme, such practice does not have
a solid scientiﬁc rationale, as these patients are highly unlikely to

have developed any neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
In fact, even among individuals who recover from SARS-CoV-2 on
their own, one-third have low or undetectable neutralizing
antibody titers2. Such a plasma black market is reminiscent of
events in the 1990s in China, where an HIV epidemic began with
local pay-for-plasma schemes15.
Rapid and affordable antibody-based HIV and COVID-19 testing
capacity must be escalated in the developing world. One possible
strategy is to share plasmids with biomedical facilities in low- and
middle-income countries, which could then locally produce the
reagents for antibody-based testing, circumventing the high costs
and waiting times associated with importing such tests from
abroad10. Centers with a proven track record of testing for
endemic contagious diseases in the developing world exist, some
of them resulting from multinational collaborations with developed nations16. Furthermore, antibody-based tests generated inhouse may be more accurate and cost-effective than commercial
ones17, so sharing parts and reagents (e.g., plasmids, puriﬁed
antibodies) may be more desirable than already assembled testing
kits. Importantly, conventional antibody-based HIV testing may
miss early infection18. Hence, methods to detect viral nucleic acids
directly remain desirable. Recently developed CRISPR-based
methods to detect speciﬁc viral RNA sequences amenable to
lyophilization, long-term storage, and reconstitution on paper
represent a promising approach to detect the presence of SARSCoV-2 and HIV, both RNA viruses, in locations with little to no
healthcare infrastructures19,20. More bilateral and multilateral
scientiﬁc collaborations between high- and low- and middleincome countries should be encouraged to gradually foster
productive scientiﬁc collaboration and build local biomedical
infrastructure21.
In summary, convalescent plasma therapy holds promise as an
emergency transient treatment for critical COVID-19 patients.
Nevertheless, it is of utmost importance to emphasize that, unlike
chemicals, such as hydroxychloroquine, which can only harm the
individual taking them, plasma therapy can endanger entire
communities. In scenarios of scarce blood-borne pathogen testing
capacities, few enforced regulations, and widespread misinformation and disease stigma, unregulated convalescent plasma
therapy may well become a recipe for a new HIV epidemic in
the developing world.
