"7" "The advent of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has renewed the debate about the credibility of   health  information shared across social network sites,  (SNS),  such as Facebook.  Despite the se concerns , empirical studies into the reliability and accuracy of Facebook posts are largely limited.  The objective of this study is to judge the accuracy and reliability of COVID-19-related   information shared on Facebook  u sing a mixed methodology . T he authors extracted Facebook posts (text and embedded video links) in English from Buzzsumo between March 11, 2020, to April 31, 2020, using  predetermined  keyword s.  The first 50 posts pertaining to each keyword were extracted and analyzed using a one-way ANOVA, Tukey test for post hoc analysis,  and  modified DISCERN score. A qualitative content analysis was then conducted to contextualize the data.   196 posts were included in the analysis, with 24,084,564 shares and 3,436,275 comments.   Useful posts had higher interactions compared to misleading and irrelevant posts (p <  0 .05). The mean mDISCERN score for reliability was 3.2/5 for useful videos. The majority of the posts (56%)  comprised  positive appeals.   Facebook is a widely utilized  SNS with the potential of  communicating  accurate and reliable  public health  information if utilized  efficiently  by  a cademic  or  research institutions   and government health agencies ."

"9" "Introduction"
"10" "Controversies abound about the accuracy of information shared on Facebook. Yet, Facebook  continues to be one  of  the most utilized social network sites (SNS) worldwide  (Facebook, 20 04 ; Abramson et al .  2015)."
"11" "In the wake of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the World Health Organization (WHO) cautioned that the proliferation of misinformation on SNS ' s, including Facebook, might become deadlier than the virus itself  (WHO, 2020).  In response, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive officer said on April 16, 2020, \"Through this crisis, one of my top priorities is making sure that you see accurate and authoritative information across all of our apps,\"  ( Zuckerberg , 2020)  signaling the platform's commitment to flattening the curve of the virus. Consequently, Facebook created a live opt-in/opt-out COVID-19 Information Center accessible to the platform ' s users  ( A 1) ."
"12" "Many scholars have investigated the integrity of information on Facebook shared during previous public health crises, including infectious diseases – the Zika virus  (Sharma et al. 2017;  Sommariva et al. 2018) , H1N1 pandemic  (Biswas 2013) , Ebola  (Adebimpe et al. 2015) , and vaccine-related outbreaks  (Schmidt et al. 2018; Waszak et al. 2018)  – and non-infectious diseases (e.g., cancer and inflammatory bowel disease ) (Okuhara et al. 2017; Groshek et al. 2017; Waszak et al. 2018).  Other studies have also sought to measure the degree of accuracy in user-comments shared in response to Facebook post s   (Tustin et al. 2018).  In unison, these studies conclude that misinformation was more commonly shared than useful information. Since much is still unknown about COVID-19, with the rise of public hysteria and unimaginable behaviors (e.g., tissue paper hoarding and erroneous \"cure\" for COVID-19), misinformation might ultimately become deadlier than the virus , if efforts to disseminate accurate and reliable  health-related  information are not adopted."
"13" "The primary objective of this paper is to critically appraise the  health-related  contents of Facebook posts shared as COVID-19 continues to evolve in o rder  to ascertain their accuracy and reliability. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations that will be useful to public health organizations and governmental agencies on how best to leverage Facebook in providing timely and accurate public health information to the public to dispel misinformation."
"14" "Materials and Methods"
"15" "To understand emerging social media messaging content related to COVID-19, we used a mixed-methods  approach   (Feilzer 2010; Sharp et al. 2012;  Onwuegbuzie et al. 2009 ;  Croswell & Poth 2018)  to 1) extract quantitative data and analyze it, then 2) contextualize findings using a qualitative analysis. Quantitative methods included ANOVA, Tukey test, and mDISCERN score, and a qualitative content analysis was used as a secondary step to account for the various contextual factors (e.g., behavioral and social factors) to provide a robust and in-depth understanding of our research question ."
"16" "Search Protocol"
"17" "We extracted Facebook posts (text and embedded video links) from Buzzsumo Enterprise Application (Buzzsumo Limited, Brighton, United Kingdom)  (Buzzsumo, 2020).  Buzzsumo is a user-friendly social media content analytics and curation tool for content marketers and researchers across various disciplines  ( Sommariva et al. 2018; Zaila et al. 2020; Waszak et al. 2018 ).  The tool  collates data across several SNSs, including Facebook, based on search queries or keywords. The authors used Buzzsumo to establish the transparency and replicability of the study ."
"18" "We searched and applied the relevant filters to account for our study criteria on Buzzsumo from March 11, 2020, when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic to April 31, 2020, using the keywords \"COVID-19\", \"coronavirus,\" \"pandemic,\"  \" Chinese virus,\"  \" Wuhan virus.\" For each keyword, Buzzsumo returned the data on the total volume of Facebook engagements; shares, likes, comments, and interactions. Our search yielded 574 posts during the study period ( Figure 1 ). Of these, we  extracted  the first 50 posts from each keyword with a cumulative total of 250 posts for analysis.  Fifty  posts  per  keyword were selected because  the  saturation of content was ach ie ved .  Moreover, the sample size from previous studies investigating SNSs usually ranged between 20-250  units of analysis   (D ' Souza et al. 2020; Sharma et al. 2017; Li et al. 2020; Khatri et al. 2020) .  The search strategy was developed  a priori  (Khatri et al. 2020; D ' Souza et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020)."
"19" "Figure 1. Flow Diagram of Included Posts"
"20" "Study selection and criteria"
"21" "We included posts in English containing the selected keywords. We excluded posts in other languages, duplicates, posts with information unrelated to keywords, advertisements, or sponsored posts intending to sell a product, inaudible videos, and video duration longer than 10 minutes. Previous studies established a 10-16 mins optimal length when analyzing video contents because viewership and saturation are achieved during this  cut off   (Khatri et al. 2020).  Two independent reviewers (KA and OK) reviewed and analyzed each post for eligibility. KA is a public health expert while OK is a physician with a public health training.  We resolved discrepancies by consensus. Approval from the Institutional Review Board was not required as the study involved publicly available data."
"22" "Coding Scheme"
"23" "Phase 1: Categorization of Posts"
"24" "We classified posts (shares and comments) as useful if they contained at least one scientifically correct information (symptoms, treatment, prevention, and other preventive measures of the disease) about coronavirus or if it provided information about the current state of the disease in terms of the social and financial impact on communities. Posts with scientifically unproven data (e.g., referring to COVID19 as a hoax, man-made, or government conspiracy) were coded as misleading. We determined the veracity of the posts using scholarly cited references and guidance from official health authorities, such as the WHO  (WHO, 2020; John Hopkins University, 2020) . An additional category was coded as irrelevant if the posts contained personal opinion, experiences, stories, jokes, or information unrelated to useful COVID19 information."
"25" "We categorized sources of Facebook posts as academic/research institutions, government agencies, including health departments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), such as WHO, news agencies, verified and unverified Facebook users. We also included other Facebook groups, such as political advocacy groups. Facebook defines verified users as confirmed and authenticated accounts or profiles of public figures, media, or brand. Facebook places a blue badge beside the user name to ascertain their verified status  (Facebook, 2020).  We distinguished between account types because verified users command a substantial number of followership and interactions compared to unverified Facebook accounts. The authors created the coding scheme a priori  (Khatri et al. 2020; D ' Souza et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020)."
"26" "Phase 2: Quantitative Analysis"
"27" "We used the modified DISCERN score to access the reliability and quality of the videos  (Khatri et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020).  m DISCERN score allots one point for clarity, reliable source of information, lack of bias, reference supplementation, and mention of uncertainty  (Khatri et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020) . A maximum of 5 points indicates high reliability and quality of the video.  One author (OK) coded the m DISCERN  score, while KA conducted an audit check to control for bias ( Billups, 201 4 ; Bradley et al .  2007 ).     Further, a one-way ANOVA was done after log transformations of the variables: shares and comments, to accommodate for the violation of equal variance and normal distribution, and then followed by a Tukey comparison test for the post hoc analysis for all categories. Consequently, we used Microsoft Excel and STATA 14.0 for the study analysis. We considered a p-value of 0.05, significant."
"28" "Phase 3: Qualitative Content Analysis"
"29" "Finally, we conducted a qualitative content analysis on the useful and misleading posts to appraise the characteristics of the Facebook contents critically. The qualitative content analysis employs  \" a systematic and objective means of describing and quantifying a phenomenon  (Elo & Kyngas, 2007, p.108) \"  while  \" making replicable and valid inferences from data to their context, to provide knowledge, new insights, a representation of facts and a practical guide to action  (Elo & Kyngas, 2007, p.108) . \"  In this study, therefore, the analysis was performed on the text only, rather than the videos, because content analysis is best suitable for textual data focusing on explicit descriptions of the contents that elucidate the  themes ( Vaismoradi et al. 2016 ) . We iteratively developed and quantified the themes through inductive and deductive reasoning  (Elo et al. 2014;  Chew &  Eysenbach , 2010;  Elo & Kyngas, 2007) . We coded posts as containing medical content about COVID19, user appeals (subcategorized as positive appeals and negative appeals), advice or recommendation to the public, and statements related to philanthropic causes.  One author (KA) coded all posts; OK and TN conducted an audit check  ( Billups, 201 4 ;  Bradley et al .  2007) ."

Further, NGO ' s, non-verified Facebook users, and governmental agencies accounted for fewer posts shared. There were no posts from academic and research institutions – Figure 3 ."
"98" "Figure 3. Pie Chart showing the distribution of publishing sources"

"135" "Discussion"
"136" "This study set out to critically appraise Facebook posts shared  early  during the COVID-19  p andemic to determine the accuracy and reliability of information available to the public. The frequency of useful posts in this study was higher than misleading posts. This finding is encouraging and consistent with studies evaluating YouTube posts during COVID-19 and the H1N1 Pandemic  (Khatri et al. 2020; D ' Souza et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020;  Pandey   et al. 2010]. The proactive measures adopted to combat the spread of misinformation by international organizations, such as the WHO COVID-19 myth busters and efforts from the management of Facebook, may account for these findings."
"137" "Our study found two unanticipated and troubling results relating to the source of information. First, there were no posts from academic and research institutes all through the study period. In previous studies, these organizations have been largely under-represented  (Khatri et al. 2020; D ' Souza et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020),  signaling a troubling pattern and missed opportunities to contribute meaningfully to public health education. Furthermore, government agencies, including health departments, represented fewer percentages of publishing sources. Second, the prevalence of misleading information was highest among online news agencies. This is catastrophic, given the enormous viewership of the posts. The proliferation of misleading information on SNSs has the potential of causing detrimental health effects and negative behaviors  (Tasnim et al., 2020).  These results are particularly worrisome considering the onus to keep the public up-to-date with accurate and authoritative information rests on organizations such as these."
"138" "Results from the mean DISCERN score revealed that most of the videos were moderately useful and reliable. Our analysis compares to similar findings analyzing the reliability of the information on COVID-19 on YouTube  (Khatri et al., 2020).  We can deduce that  al though most of the information disseminated is useful, there are still missed opportunities on SNS that could be harnessed to provide accurate  health-related  information about the virus. Against this backdrop, our study infers that even though Facebook is a widely utilized social network site with the potential of reaching and providing  public health  education to a wide array of audiences towards flattening the COVID-19 curve, misleading information still looms."
"139" "Concerning the content analysis, posts about the pandemic response containing positive appeals (e.g., expressing support, empathy to healthcare workers and families impacted by the virus) accounted for about 56% while posts with negative appeals (e.g., expressing anger or frustration) had slightly fewer posts (44%). This trend is consistent with previous studies  ( Prematunge et al. 2014 ;  Husemann et al. 2015 ) , and a plausible explanation to this finding might be that positive appeals make health messages more effective and might cushion the adverse emotional toll associated with public health crises, including COVID-19. This result further suggests that if used appropriately, Facebook could be a powerful tool for public health organizations and professions to capture and educate a broader range of audiences to influence positive  health  behavior."
"140" "There are several strengths in this study. First, we used  both  quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate the contents of Facebook posts.  We utilized objective validated tools (mDISCERN and statistical tests) to critically appraise the posts shared on Facebook during COVID-19, which contrasts with other studies that do not use validated tools  (Sharma et al. 2017).  Further, we conducted a qualitative content analysis that provides insight as well as describes the contents of information shared on Facebook. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to analyze the reliability of Facebook posts (both text and videos) as regards to the  COVID19  p andemic."
"141" "T here are limitations to our research. We note that information about the origin, epidemiology, and case-fatality ratio of the coronavirus has and continues to be reported extensively  (Cui et al. 2019; John Hopkins University, 2020);  as such, we do not report those findings.  Like other cross-sectional studies, we  provide a snapshot of the pandemic within  its first six weeks . Since the time of this writing, COVID-19 is still evolving,  and thus  information on Facebook might likely change to account for the changes. Furthermore, because there is no consensus on sample size, we limited our analysis to 250 posts, and as such, these posts do not accurately capture a wide range of posts shared on Facebook. Notwithstanding, however, our sample size aligns with previous studies  (Sharma et al. 2017; Khatri et al. 2020; D ' Souza et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020) , and it is unlikely that this limitation will have a significant effect on our result s .  Finally, we only limited our search to Facebook, which does not reflect the activities of other SNS  (e.g., Twitter and blogs)  and the impact these SNS might have on COVID-19."
"142" "Based on our findings, we recommend public health organizations and government agencies to incorporate Facebook as a means of disseminating accurate and authoritative  public health  information. Similarly, recommendations by Li et al. (2020), stated that these agencies should consider identifying and collaborating with verified Facebook users to deliver health messages due to the high propensity of reaching larger audiences. Facebook should also develop stringent data-mining algorithms to identify and expunge misleading information. Moreover, because much is unknown about COVID-19, future studies should critically assess the contents on other SNS, including Twitter, blogs, and webpages, to provide additional insights into the quality of information available to the public. Further, researchers should examine a more extended timeframe to account for longitudinal changes to show deviation, if any, from our present study. This information will be useful for relevant stakeholders, particularly academic and research institutes, as well as health agencies, to understand public online behaviors in order to address and educate the public. It will also offer new perceptions about the pandemic while serving as a protocol in the event of future public health crises."
"143" "Conclusion"
"144" "In conclusion, we used  a mixed-methodology  to examine the content of Facebook posts critically.   Specifically, we utilized quantitative (ANOVA, Turkey test, and mDISCERN scores) and qualitative   methods (content analysis) to ensure a robust analysis of our research question. Our results indicate   that Facebook is a widely utilized SNS for information seeking during the COVID-19 Pandemic; however,   reliable information from authoritative sources is sparse, which is somewhat troubling. Academic   institutions, mainstream media, government health agencies, and NGOs should increase their visibility   on Facebook to keep the public informed as the COVID-19  p andemic continues to evolve."
