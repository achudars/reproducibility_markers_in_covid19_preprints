evidence-based interventions

Abstract

Introduction

organisational regulations, and insufficient time to cope with
occupational challenges, a rapidly evolving knowledge base,
and a lack of interpersonal support in everyday life (3). These
challenges often lead to “emotional exhaustion,” where a
person feels overwhelmed and lacks the energy to accomplish
a task. “Depersonalisation” may follow emotional exhaustion,
where a person may cynically treat others as objects. Also,
a diminished sense of self-efficacy and competence affect
the emotional wellbeing of an individual. Thus, emotional
exhaustion, depersonalisation, and a decreased sense of
personal accomplishments characterise burnout, which is
a growing concern for the healthcare community globally.
A systematic review found burnout scores for emotional
exhaustion ranged from 31% to 54.3%, depersonalisation
17.4% to 44.5%, and low personal accomplishment 6% to
39.6% among doctors in the UK (1). Another meta-analytic
review found 11.23% of participating nurses experienced
burnout globally (2). Such a high burden of burnout is likely to
increase during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic,
where healthcare providers in most health systems face a
high workload. Recent media reports also highlight this critical
challenge (4, 5), which may affect healthcare values during
this pandemic, necessitating ethical discourse on burnout.
This article discusses the current scenario of burnout among
healthcare providers during Covid-19, key ethical implications,
and highlights potential strategies to address them.

Professional burnout is a major global health concern among
physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers (1–3).
Healthcare providers often experience high workload, strict

Psychosocial stressors during Covid-19 and a high
burden of burnout

Burnout is a major occupational problem among healthcare
providers, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. The frontline
health workforce is experiencing a high workload and multiple
psychosocial stressors which may affect their mental and
emotional health, leading to burnout symptoms. Moreover,
sleep deprivation and a critical lack of psychosocial support
may aggravate such symptoms amidst Covid-19. From an
ethical viewpoint, healthcare providers may experience moral
distress while safeguarding patient welfare and autonomy.
Moreover, social injustice and structural inequities may affect
their emotional health while tackling a high volume of new
cases and mortality. Global evidence indicates the need for
adopting multipronged evidence-based approaches to address
burnout during this pandemic, which may include increasing
the awareness of work-related stress and burnout, promoting
mindfulness and self-care practices for promoting mental
wellbeing, ensuring optimal mental health services, using digital
technologies to address workplace stress and deliver mental
health interventions, and improving organisational policies and
practices focusing on burnout among healthcare providers.

A wide range of occupational stressors is associated with
Covid-19. Large numbers of potential cases arriving in
hospitals and constraining institutional capacities result
in additional workplace-related stress, especially among
emergency care providers. Moreover, working hard during
emergencies or stressful conditions often comes with sleep
deprivation, increasing the risks of burnout (6). A Canadian
Medical Association study found emergency physicians are
almost three times as likely to suffer depression compared to
the national average while one in seven physicians had suicidal
thoughts in normal times (7). Other studies have shown that
healthcare providers working in infection control or among
isolated or quarantined individuals are likely to experience
multiple mental health problems (8). In addition, many of
the existing providers are withdrawn or suggested selfisolation after working on Covid-19 cases (9). Such concurrent

institutions (18). Moreover, ongoing public health
emergencies like Covid-19 may not provide adequate
scope for analysing the most ethical approaches, as
the institutions are stressed by the additional volume
of Covid-19 patients alongside regular patients. Such
challenges remain underexplored in the available literature,
and this necessitates further ethical assessment and
discourse.

experience of high workload, the fear of being infected, and
disrupted social support during isolation or quarantine are
critical factors that may influence burnout and associated
psychosocial health outcomes (8). Many other challenges like
the lack of personal protective equipment, may crucially affect
mental health and wellbeing among healthcare providers
(10, 11). Additionally, they are sometimes stigmatised as
possible carriers of the virus by members of the public, as
reported in several news media (12, 13), increasing stress and
hastening burnout. These are some glimpses of the difficulties
experienced by frontline health workers, though the true
psychosocial and epidemiological burden of burnout during
Covid-19 is largely underreported.

The current scenario provides an adequate basis to
acknowledge critical gaps in the context of Covid-19 that may
increase burnout among healthcare providers, with the ethical
implications stated above. Therefore, drawing insights from
evidence-based approaches may help in mitigating burnout,
and help healthcare providers to overcome the ethical
challenges, manage their stress, and fulfil their professional
responsibilities satisfactorily.

Perspectives on healthcare ethics
The ongoing pandemic has created several unique ethical
dilemmas for healthcare workers:

Potential strategies for addressing burnout in
healthcare providers during COVID-19

•• While healthcare providers have the autonomy to
decide on working in a healthcare organisation based
on perceived safety or risks, they also have a shared
responsibility to serve people in a humanitarian crisis.
In a pandemic, ethical values, including the autonomy
of providers to make decisions may be curtailed, thus
affecting their psychological and emotional health (14).

Some steps based on multipronged evidence-based
approaches which could address stress and prevent burnout
during this pandemic are:
Making healthcare providers aware of potential burnout
Burnout can be prevented if the providers are made aware of
the risks and prepared for potential occupational stress. Such
awareness can reduce the stigma linked to mental health
conditions like burnout and help in developing resilience. For
example, a study on Ebola response found that situational
awareness alongside other preventive measures improved
psychological resilience among healthcare providers (19). A
meta-analysis found the correlation between resilience and
burnout among Iranian nurses was -0.57 (95% confidence
interval [CI]: -0.354-0.726) (20). This evidence highlights the role
of increasing awareness and adopting strategies to empower
healthcare providers during Covid-19.

•• Moral distress has been identified across the scholarly
community as a root cause of burnout in healthcare
providers (14-16). Dzeng and Wachter argue that healthcare
providers who struggle to balance institutional priorities
with the best interests of patients are highly vulnerable to
moral dissonance (14). Such distress would be aggravated
when serving large numbers of patients within limited
institutional capacities.
•• Patient autonomy and welfare remain core ethical concepts
in medical practice which are critically affected in case of
patients on ventilator support (16). With limited therapeutic
options for Covid-19, a physician may face moral
uncertainly while deciding on treatment, with the patient
unable to participate in decision-making due to a critical
health condition. Earlier studies have established that
intensive care providers often experience such dilemmas
and experience more burnout in their careers (15, 16).

Promoting positive mental health: Mindfulness and self-care
practices
Positive mental health can prevent work-related stress and
burnout, which should be promoted among healthcare
providers during the pandemic. Several strategies include
decreasing the workload, improving work schedules,
promoting self-management, initiating mindfulness-based
stress reduction and mental health promotion activities
for reducing the risks of burnout (21). A meta-analysis of 17
studies among 632 nurses had found lower standardised mean
difference for emotional exhaustion (1.32; 95% CI: -9.41-6.78)
and depersonalisation (1.91; 95% CI: -4.50-0.68), and a higher
mean difference for personal accomplishment (2.12; 95% CI:
-9.91-14.14) (22). During Covid-19, healthcare organisations
and professional entities may facilitate mindfulness-based
interventions and self-management exercises promoting
mental health and preventing potential burnout.

•• News reports, several from developed nations, highlight
that marginalised populations, including racial and ethnic
minorities, are more likely to get infected and have adverse
healthcare access as well as outcomes (17). This can be
profoundly challenging for those struggling to cope with
rapidly increasing new cases and fatalities every day of this
pandemic. Despite their dedication, structural inequities
may affect the emotional health of healthcare providers
(14), and lead to helplessness in the face of challenges
closely related to social justice and human rights.
•• Lastly, ethical concerns can be uniquely different in
diverse settings, which calls for a careful assessment of
context-specific issues and their ethical implications
through designated ethical committees in the respective

Covid-19, but such opportunities should be explored. Potential
strategies to improve access to mental health services may
include involving mental health experts in multidisciplinary
Covid-19 teams, who may provide services or refer healthcare
workers showing symptoms of burnout to appropriate
resources (3). In addition, group-based counseling or peersupport sessions may effectively address burnout and improve
mental health during Covid-19.

distress, autonomy and welfare of the patient, and social
justice, affecting health service delivery and maintenance of
a healthy workforce in healthcare organizations during this
pandemic. Evidence-based approaches for preventing burnout
that have shown effectiveness in various contexts may help in
identifying appropriate measures based on unique situations
and available resources. Health policy makers and practitioners
should adopt such interventions and develop context-specific
approaches promoting a healthy workplace, addressing ethical
issues, and preventing burnout among healthcare providers
during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Leveraging digital technologies to prevent burnout
In recent years, digital interventions are increasingly being
used to improve health services and outcomes. One approach
can be the balanced use of electronic health records to
coordinate work schedules, monitor healthy work patterns,
and address the risks of overburdening frontline healthcare
providers during Covid-19. Counselling and interventions using
digital platforms like mobile phones, apps, or internet-enabled
devices can be an alternative option (9).

Creating an enabling environment through organisational
approaches

1.

It is essential to improve organisational measures to create a
lasting impact on the work culture alongside interpersonal
interventions, and address workplace stress. A meta-analysis
found that organisation-directed interventions were
associated with a medium reduction in burnout score (SMD
= - 0.446; 95% CI:- 0.619 - 0.274), while physician-directed
interventions were associated with a moderate reduction
in burnout score (SMD = - 0.178; 95% CI: - 0.322 - 0.035) (3).
Potential strategies include improving workflow management,
organising services focusing on reducing workload, enhancing
interoperability, arranging discussion and exchanging opinions,
improving communication skills, provision for adequate
rest and exercise, organising workshops on coping skills,
and devising policies and practices for reducing burnout
among health workforce during this pandemic(3, 9). These
approaches may foster a supportive and enabling environment
for healthcare providers. However, it is essential to include
the healthcare provider in devising strategies for creating an
enabling environment. A shared decision-making may assist
in understanding potential challenges experienced by the
providers, including the impacts of their participation or nonparticipation in Covid-19 responses on payroll or performance
appraisal, operational challenges within and between hospital
departments, individual and group psychosocial challenges
that may affect the health workforce as well as health service
delivery during this pandemic.

Conclusion

11.

Healthcare providers often experience occupational stress
leading to burnout, which may be aggravated during Covid-19.
While they work to fulfil their professional responsibilities, it
is essential to recognise how workplace-related stress may
affect their mental and emotional wellbeing. Such stressors
may further impact resource-constrained contexts resulting in
a severe paucity of healthcare providers. Furthermore, those
stressors have profound ethical implications including moral
