The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, a disease caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2
(Zhu et al., 2020), has presented major challenges to international public health systems. As new
data surrounding the epidemiology of the disease continues to emerge, policy recommendations
made by institutions such as the World Health Organization have been continually modified and
inconsistently applied by national and local governments. For instance, in an effort to contain
the initial spread of the disease internationally and reduce the rate of transmission domestically,
early affected countries implemented policies to restrict travel and limit the social contact of
their citizens (Acosta and Nestore, 2020; Anderson et al., 2020). While these strategies have been
found to be effective at reducing the rates of new cases and minimizing the resulting strain to
national healthcare systems (Chinazzi et al., 2020), global spread of the disease proved to be
unavoidable. Yet specific responses enacted by national governments to mitigate the impact the
pandemic would have on their society have varied (Anderson et al., 2020), and in cases, seemingly
come in contradiction to one another. Inherent to these discrepancies appears to be a concern
between limiting the health and mortality repercussions of the pandemic, opposed with reducing
the economic impact associated with commercial and social restraint (Sheridan et al., 2020). The
fractured international approach has highlighted the limitations established forms of governance
have in agreeing upon and implementing legitimate measures of resolution during a rapidly
evolving global pandemic, and how these limitations culminate in serious strains to international
public relations.
Recently, the concept of transnational youth networks (TYNs) has emerged as a flexible solution
to many of the obstacles faced by international and domestic governance (Acosta et al., 2020).
Defined broadly as a cross-disciplinary professional group with members under the age of 40 and
selected based on a competitive process that analyzes professional achievements, the hallmarks
of TYNs maintain a versatile set of descriptions. These include the selection of members based
on the merit of professional achievements, empowerment of decision-making capabilities toward
achieving a defined goal, and the application of unique experiential knowledge of individual
members (Acosta et al., 2020). Prior to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, organization of
TYNs was proposed as a means of driving forward public diplomacy, particularly in relation to the
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) agenda (Acosta et al., 2020). At the present
moment, the preeminent objectives of the SDG agenda have been put in jeopardy by the unfolding
pandemic (Naidoo and Fisher, 2020). Most relevantly, the objective of ensuring the health and
well-being of global citizens through efficient funding and access to healthcare systems, along
with increased sanitation and hygiene (Filho et al., 2020; Sustainable Development Goals, 2020).

2020), inspiring innovative design solutions for low cost and
readily transportable ventilators from youth teams. These include
ventures by US university students (Levy, 2020b; Rusch, 2020),
as well as a team of young engineers from India, a country
with an especially sparse ventilator inventory compared to the
domestic population (Biswas, 2020). Additionally, a large review
of these types of open source designs has been compiled for
future adaption (Pearce, 2020). One of the most comprehensive
networks involved in broad scale coordination between globally
distributed volunteer groups working to design and produce
PPE and medical supplies has been the Open Source Medical
Supplies. This organization reports a current record of statistics
related to the above venture, including the number of countries
actively involved in local response efforts and the total amount
of supplies that have been successfully delivered by the global
community (Open Source Medical Supplies). Continuing to
increase the supply and universal accessibility of ventilators will
not only aid the treatment capabilities of underserved health care
systems but may also begin to alleviate international diplomacy
tensions that result from global medical equipment shortages.
Of particular interest, is the focus youth networks have made
on advocating for the attention to how regional aspects of
the developing world pose specific challenges to coping with a
spreading pandemic. For instance, populations living in high
altitude regions such as Ethiopia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Tibet,
are sensitive to environmental conditions and physiological
adaptations that influence the effectiveness of common ventilator
design (Breevoort et al., 2020). Given the limited influence
these regions have in the development of traditional health care
equipment, special considerations will be necessary to design
and supply ventilators capable of functioning effectively for high
altitude populations.
Perhaps most at risk of suffering from a lack of specialized
intervention in regards to the COVID-19 pandemic are refugee
populations and people living in war zones (Jahanshahi et al.,
2020). Given the poverty of health care related infrastructure,
coupled with increased rates of underlying medical conditions
and high population densities often found in refugee camps, the
risk of infection within these zones has been a notably difficult
problem for traditional governmental systems to address. To
help facilitate screening capabilities of health care practitioners
serving refugee populations, students at Harvard University
have developed a software solution for the efficient collection
and sharing of patient data (Parks, 2020). This technology has
now become widely available and adapted to the needs of
health practitioners within refugee camps across the globe. This
development can be viewed as a pivotal first step to mitigating
the severity of the pandemic on displaced populations, but more
measures will clearly be needed to resolve the special vulnerability
of these groups.

While the WHO and its affiliated partners have been paramount
in providing recommendations to national governments’
response to the pandemic, groups tantamount to TYNs
have ascended to resolve many of the deficiencies left by
broader governing bodies. Here we will provide an overview
of exemplary solutions designed by these groups and present
support for the continued backing of these types of networks
as a mechanism to engage international crises. Though these
groups do not fall definitively within our working definition of
TYNs, we will argue that they contribute useful models of youth
empowerment, nonetheless.

YOUTH NETWORKS AND THE COVID-19
PANDEMIC
Underlying the initial decision made by many national
governments to enact extensive quarantining measures on
citizens was a concern of overwhelming health care systems with
growing rates of COVID-19 patient numbers. Accompanying
predictions of shortages of health care system resources was an
anticipation of a lack of available personal protective equipment
(PPE) for health care workers. In the United States, while
health care systems struggle to correspond with the national
government for these supplies, a decentralized source of supply
chain management was constructed by a coalition of young
volunteers. To date, the C19 Coalition reports to have successfully
supplied over 100 million PPE units to health care systems
across the US and has formed a working collaboration with
the National Governors Association, connecting governmental
bodies with public and private organizations (Levy, 2020a).
Additionally, creative solutions to develop new forms of PPE
have been organized under the banner of #HackThePandemic
and unified by hackthepandemic.org (Mensley, 2020). This
organization allows volunteers and researchers across the globe
access to 3D printable mask designs, as well as the ability to
contribute large scale manufacturing capabilities of supplies and
computing power aimed at the pursuit of understanding the
disease through simulations of protein folding. The capability to
3D print effective mask designs has been embraced by high school
and university students across the United States, including those
in initially hard-hit cities such as New York and Seattle (Reid,
2020; Schlosser, 2020; Siegal, 2020). These techniques have been
transferred and reproduced in other countries, particularly in the
developing world (Tendencias El Tiempo, 2020). These initiatives
provide outstanding examples of how the youth can adapt new
technologies to contribute to solving dilemmas currently facing
healthcare systems.
Along with shortages of PPE, a looming concern for
international healthcare systems remains a lack of available
ventilators, an essential piece of equipment for the treatment
of critically ill patients (Truog et al., 2020). These inventory
shortages have placed major strains on international diplomacy,
as countries have exercised restrictions of the transport of
ventilators across borders, and in some cases gone as far as
resorting to the confiscation of other countries’ ventilators during
international transit (Kamdar, 2020). The developing world
remains most vulnerable to these shortages (Breevoort et al.,

Youth Networks During the Pandemic

by 2030 (Joshi et al., 2015). While received with enthusiasm by
most member States, the COVID-19 pandemic can potentially
delay and even jeopardize the implementation of many of those
goals (Naidoo and Fisher, 2020). Indeed, several analyses have
revealed that the pandemic has worsened inequalities throughout
the world and active interventions from governments are needed
to address these issues (Ashford et al., 2020). To assist these
needs, UNICEF has been at the forefront of organizing remote
networks of youth volunteers inspired to rise to challenges
specific to their communities (Hawke, 2020). The formation of
this network, headed entirely by youth volunteers, was able to
quickly progress through the stages of volunteer recruitment,
identification of specific challenges, and response of clear-cut
actions. This included initiatives that are aimed at safeguarding
the mental health of the youth through access to online
psychologists and creation of seed banks to be distributed for
home gardening projects.
In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, youth networks
have primarily focused on SDGs 3, 4, 9, 10, and 17. Namely: Good
health and well-being; quality education; industry, innovation
and infrastructure; reduced inequalities; and partnerships for
the goals. Yet, it is important to notice that SDGs are indeed
interlinked and the development of one goal strengths the
development of others (Dawes, 2020). Dynamic mathematical
models have indeed shown that efforts to address goals 4–16
have a direct impact on goal 1, elimination of poverty (Dawes,
2020). As such providing access to healthcare technology has
an impact on economic projections (Mahler et al., 2020). Using
the examples pinpointed in this manuscript, one can see that
3D printing of PPE and ventilators, have not only addressed
SDG 3, but inspired other regions in the world to adopt these
technologies (addressing SDGs 4 and 9), consequently reducing
inequality (SDG 10) and poverty (SDG 1).

approval to only a handful of organizations (Rodrigo, 2020).
Indeed, the majority of FDA COVID-19 actions have focused
on relaxing their enforcement guidelines, rather than actively
overseeing the development and approving the use of materials
and equipment created by youth networks (Flanagan and
Ballard, 2020). A similar situation, though to varying degrees,
has been observed in other parts of the world, including
the European Union (Gierthmuehlen et al., 2020) and the
United Kingdom (Emanuel et al., 2020). While aiming to
protect the public, these procedures have produced unintended
consequences. Specifically, COVID-19 emergency donations
and loans provided by multinational organizations such as the
United Nations Development Programme, the World Bank and
the Interamerican Development Bank often require governments
to spend these resources on materials and equipment that are
certified by the FDA or the European Union (Ferreira and
Mostajo-Radji, 2020). Notable cases are beginning to show the
potential of overcoming these sorts of obstacles. For instance,
the Bolivian government has worked together with young
entrepreneurs to provide local certifications that allows them
commercialize 3D printed ventilators in the local market (Los
Tiempos Digital, 2020). Similarly, in Colombia, private and
university-based ventilators printing projects have gained
support from the national medical device regulatory body to
begin human trials (Zimmer, 2020). Surmounting governmental
regulations currently presents a major impediment to the
employment of supplies designed by non-governmental groups
and these requirements, in return, hamper governments from
supporting initiatives developed by youth networks (Condori,
2020).

CONCLUSIONS
The development of youth networks capable of identifying
and undertaking challenges specific to their communities will
not only drive forward solutions related directly to their
objectives, but consequently advance a common global agenda,
independently of direct governmental support (Carosso et al.,
2019b). Altogether, the contributions youth networks have made
toward addressing aspects of the current pandemic provide
a glimpse into the power of non-traditional forms of public
health intervention. The examples listed here should serve as
models of the benefit of forming such networks, and continued
development of youth networks motivated to solve global issues
and advance the United Nations SDGs should be kept in focus.

OBSTACLES FACED BY YOUTH
NETWORKS IN GAINING GOVERNMENTAL
SUPPORT
Due to the characteristic of being non-state actors, youth
networks are often left behind in policy and decision making
(Carosso et al., 2019a). Indeed, one of the most common negative
perceptions of young entrepreneurs and technology activists is
the lack of governmental interest and support for their initiatives
(Saucedo-Bendek et al., 2020).
The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted some
of these issues. For instance, there is an overall lack for
governmental-sponsored grants directed toward young,
independent entrepreneurs and volunteer groups (Young
and Grinsfelder, 2011; Legg, 2020; Naude, 2020). Even when
financing is obtained, the youth usually has to face additional
struggles, including difficulties in obtaining quality certifications
for their products. As an example, the United States Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) has been overly cautious in
approving the use of 3D printed PPE and medical equipment
(US Food & Drug Administration, 2020), granting emergency
