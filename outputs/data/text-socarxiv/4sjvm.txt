Changes in fertility plans during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy: the role of occupation and
income vulnerability
Bruno Arpino1, Francesca Luppi2 & Alessandro Rosina3

Abstract
The health and economic crisis generated by the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented in recent
human history. We investigate the role of objective and subjective indicators of economic
uncertainty due to the COVID-19 crisis in young Italians’ fertility plans during the year 2020. We
use unique repeated cross-sectional data, collected at different time points during the pandemic
(March and October/November 2020) together with pre-COVID data (2016). The data offer a
standard fertility intention question pre- and during-COVID, and also a direct question on whether
pre-COVID fertility plans have been confirmed, postponed or abandoned. We find that individuals
with more vulnerable occupations show a lower probability of definitely intending to have a(nother)
child in the short-term and a higher probability of having abandoned their pre-COVID fertility plan
in March 2020, while in October 2020 changes in fertility plans did not vary by occupation. Instead,
those who suffered from a negative income shock and those with negative expectations on their
future income and occupation are more likely to abandon their pre-pandemic fertility plan compared
to their better off counterparts, and these differences hold both in March and October. Overall,
economic uncertainty generated by the pandemic seems to have similarly affected men and
women’s fertility intentions. Our findings point to the fact that the unequal economic consequences
of the pandemic also produced and will produce heterogeneous effects on fertility intentions.

Introduction
The COVID-19 crisis started as a health emergency in China at the end of 2019 and rapidly turned
into a health pandemic and a global economic recession. The direct effects of the pandemic on
mortality and morbidity have been widely studied (e.g., Drefahl et al. 2020, Nasiri et al. 2020).
However, the COVID-19 pandemic likely had and will have broader demographic consequences.
In particular, since the very beginning of the pandemic, demographers have been debating about its
possible consequences on fertility. The characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic make it
unprecedented in recent human history, but previous crises may help predicting the impact on
fertility intentions and behaviours. When health and economic crises occur, the subsequent shocks
and perceived uncertainty about the future produce major impacts on individual’s life plans,
especially those implying a considerable long-term investment, such as having a child. It is well
grounded in the literature that fertility negatively responds to public health emergencies (e.g.,
Kearney and Levine 2020, Marteleto et al. 2020, Trinitapoli and Yeatman 2011) and economic
crises (e.g., Sobotka et al. 2011, Vrachnis et al. 2014). Therefore, it is expected that economic and
social changes derived by the pandemic will impact negatively on fertility, at least in high-income
countries, both in the short and in the long term (Aassve et al. 2020).
Studies on health crises show evidence of strong drops in births during and after great epidemics
(Stone 2020), such as the 1918-19 Spanish flu worldwide (Chandra and Yu 2015a, 2015b,
Donaldson and Keniston 2014, Chandra et al. 2018) and the Zika epidemic in South America
(Marteleto et al. 2020). Despite the 1918 and the 2020 pandemics share some similar patterns,
differently from the Spanish flu, which strongly hit the young population, the COVID-19 pandemic,
up to now, has increased mortality especially among older people (Ho et al., 2020). This means that
the health dimension of the COVID-19 crisis may not be directly responsible for a revision of preCOVID fertility intentions, while the subsequent economic recession may produce such an effect.
As for previous economic crises, there is a wide literature on the effects of objective and subjective
financial factors on fertility intentions and behaviours, both at the micro and the macro level (e.g.,
Sobotka et al. 2011, Goldstein et al. 2013, Matysiak et al. 2021, Dupray and Pailhé 2018, Pailhé and
Solaz 2012, Palumbo and Sironi 2016, Modena and Sabatini 2012, Testa and Basten 2014, Novelli
et al. 2020). In periods of great economic uncertainty, as the COVID-19 pandemic has already been
proved to be (Baker et al. 2020), people tend to postpone childbearing (Kreyenfeld 2010,
Kreyenfeld et al. 2012, Vignoli et al. 2020a), and long-lasting recessions negatively affect fertility
2

intentions and behaviours, if they lead to an enduring or even permanent loss of income among
young adults (Kearney and Levine 2020).
The expected and experienced worsening of economic conditions sum up with other indirect
consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, which might also negatively affect fertility intentions
and behaviours such as the reduced availability of care services (both formal and informal) and the
uncertainty about their future availability; the increased difficulties in accessing Assisted
reproductive technology (ART) and reproductive health care (Beaujouan 2021, Lindberg 2020); an
overall decline in the individual’s subjective well-being (Zacher et al. 2020, Blasco-Belled et al.
2020), in the satisfaction with the work-family reconciliation (Mohring et al. 2020), and in the
quality of the couple relationship (Panzeri et al. 2020, Luetke et al. 2020).
Following the call for ad hoc studies for understanding short-term demographic consequences of the
COVID-19 pandemic (Beaujouan 2021), the aim of this paper is to examine the role of occupational
status, experienced loss of income and expected worsening of income and occupational conditions
due to the COVID-19 crisis on young Italians’ fertility plans during the year 2020. Although some
official statistics on births starts to be available at the aggregate level (see e.g., Blangiardo (2021)
for Italy and Cohen (2021) and Sobotka et al. (2021) on other countries), our focus on fertility
intentions allows assessing the role of the uncertainty about economic conditions created by the
pandemic on the possible redefinition of individuals’ fertility plans at the micro level. Macro-level
fertility trends are informative on the overall possible short-term fertility effects of the pandemic,
but they are limited in their ability to provide insights on the heterogeneities in these effects, which
is crucial given that the pandemic’s effects have been considerably unequal.
We use a unique longitudinal (repeated cross-sectional) dataset, collected at two different time
points during the pandemic (March and October/November 2020) together with pre-COVID data
(2016), to explore the changes in Italian young people’s fertility intentions. More specifically, we
consider fertility intentions under two alternative formulations: 1) the classical intention to conceive
a child in the following 12 months, before and during the pandemic (i.e., in October 2016 and
November 2020); 2) distinguishing between those who decided to confirm, postpone or abandon –
at least temporarily – the pre-pandemic fertility plans in March and October 2020, among those
retrospectively reporting to have a plan in January 2020 for conceiving a child in the same year. The
availability of the information on changes in fertility plans together with the standard fertility
intentions question allowed us to draw a better understanding on how the pandemic has affected
3

young Italians’ fertility decisions. The information about the decision to postpone or abandon the
pre-pandemic fertility plan, in fact, offers insights on possible mechanisms leading fertility
postponement for which fertility behaviours would provide evidence only several years after the
end of the pandemic. Because fertility intentions are strong predictors of fertility behaviours
(Rindfuss et al. 1988, Schoen et al. 1999, Billari et al. 2009, Régnier-Loilier and Vignoli 2011),
especially among younger individuals (Brzozowska and Beaujouan, 2020), focusing on changes in
fertility intentions as short term effects of the pandemic also allows getting timely insights for
policy makers to promptly act to reduce potential inequalities in the ability to realize the prepandemic fertility plans.
Italy was the first Western country hit by the pandemic, with one of the highest relative number of
cases and deaths due to the COVID-19 till now (Natale et al. 2021). Additionally, compared to
other Western European countries, in Italy the economic and social consequences of the 2008 Great
Recession have been stronger and more long-lasting, mainly hitting the young population. In fact, in
2019 Italy showed one of the highest rates of youth unemployment (22.4% among young people
aged 15-29 vs 11.4% in the EU27 4) and the highest proportion of NEET – i.e., young people neither
in employment nor in education - in Europe (23.8% among young people aged 15-34 vs 14.0% in
the EU275). Additionally, before the pandemic, Italy had the lowest fertility rate in the EU area (in
2019 was 1.27 in Italy vs 1.53 in the EU27 (provisional data; 6). This means that the concerns about
the demographic future of one of most rapidly ageing European country (the 2019 old-age
dependency ratio – i.e., the number of persons aged 65+ per 100 persons aged 15-64 – was 35.8 in
Italy vs 31.4 in the EU27 7) were already an issue before the COVID-19 pandemic (Caltabiano and
Rosina 2018). The experienced and the expected economic shocks derived by the COVID-19
related economic crisis may accelerate the Italian demographic recession because the negative
consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic add to an already unfavourable context for fertility.
Economic recession and fertility behaviours and intentions
The relationship between the economic cycle and fertility has long being studied. At least in highincome countries, fertility tends to reduce during recessions and to increase during or following
periods of economic growth (e.g., Adsera and Menendez 2011, Comolli and Bernardi 2015, Cherlin

et al. 2013, Sobotka et al. 2011). The loss of job and income induce people to delay or withdraw
their family plans: leaving parental home, buying or renting a house, getting married or having
children (Kohler et al. 2002). In fact, all these plans imply substantial financial efforts. Children in
particular come at a cost – of money, time and energy – which implies parents’ long-term
investments. For this reason, job and income stability is a precondition to make fertility plans
(Kreyenfeld et al. 2012, Mills & Blossfeld 2013, Vignoli et al. 2019).
Among high income countries, the procyclical relationship between economic conditions and
fertility has been observed especially in the short term. Recessions usually negatively affect the
period total fertility rate (Kiser and Whelpton 1953), but they tended to have marginal effects on the
completed fertility of generations that experienced the crisis during their reproductive years
(Sobotka et al. 2011, Lesthaeghe 2010, Matysiak et al. 2021, Cherlin et al. 2013).
Considering specifically recessions experienced in the last 50 years, they happened in a period of
strong decline of fertility rates in Western countries, which has been mainly interpreted under the
Second Demographic Transition framework, and in which the effect attributed to the economic
turndowns per se was marginal (Kreyenfeld et al. 2012, Morgan et al. 2011, Sobotka et al. 2011).
As for the 2008 Great Recession (Cherlin et al. 2013, Caltabiano et al. 2017), it has been shown that
childbearing has been more frequently postponed in those contexts where the crisis hit the most
especially among childless young individuals (Goldstein et al. 2013, Schneider 2015, Matysiak et
al. 2021). Therefore, a short-term perspective on the consequence of a recession on fertility should
focus on intentions instead of behaviours, to better understand whether a short-term reduction in
fertility is driven by a postponement or a possible withdrawal from the original plans. However, few
studies have specifically focussed on the relationship between recessions and fertility intentions.
Most of them focused on the effect of the Great Recession (Testa and Basten 2014, Palumbo and
Sironi 2016, Novelli et al. 2020, Fiori et al. 2018), finding that perceived and experienced job and
income worsening due to the crisis is negatively influences fertility intentions.
The impact of economic uncertainty on fertility intentions and behaviours
In periods of economic recessions, economic uncertainty is amplified with detrimental
consequences on fertility (see Vignoli and Comolli 2021). An enormous increase in economic
uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic, has already been widely documented (Baker et al
2020, van der Wielen and Barrios 2020, Lambert et al. 2020; Magnusson et al. 2020; Reichelt et al.
2020). Economic uncertainty refers to “the individual risk factor, related to phases in the life course
5

that are characterized by unemployment, part-time work, working on a term-limited contract, or
difficulties entering the labour market in the first place” (Kreyenfeld et al. 2012, p. 838). Economic
uncertainty has been traditionally defined and measured through labour market indicators such as
being unemployed or being employed with a temporary contract (Kreyenfeld 2010; Kreyenfeld et
al. 2012, Vignoli et al. 2012, Mills and Blossfeld 2013, Kreyenfeld 2016, Busetta et al. 2019,
Vignoli et al. 2020a). Usually, casual, project-based, and seasonal works imply a low labour market
integration and a wage penalty if compared with those employed with temporary or permanent
contracts (Schmitt 2021). Moreover, the former jobs tend to bend more physically and mentally
tiring, with non-standard working hours, which makes work-family balance particularly difficult
(Benavides et al. 2000, Kalleberg 2009, Pirani 2017).
In most of the studies on the topic, evidence supports the existence of a negative effect of having a
more precarious job on fertility (e.g., Dupray and Pailhé 2018, Lundstrom and Andersson 2012,
Baizan 2005, Blossfeld et al. 2006, Pailhé and Solaz 2012) and fertility intentions (Pailhè 2009,
Palumbo and Sironi 2016, Modena and Sabatini 2012). However, having an unstable job is not
always linked to a higher vulnerability to recession periods: some temporary contracts are very
well-paid, and this might be seen as an opportunity, which does not have negative returns in terms
of fertility (Alderotti et al. 2019). This strictly depends on contextual characteristics such as the
structure of the labour market and the welfare system, which can act as institutional filters (Mills
and Blossfeld 2005). In a context of institutional and welfare state weakness, a condition of
economic uncertainty is much likely to negatively impact on fertility decisions, as found by Novelli
and colleagues (2020) in Italy where during the Great Recession, precarious work conditions
negatively affected fertility intentions.
Together with objective indicators related to labour market and economic conditions, an increasing
number of studies on fertility intentions and behaviours also considers the role of subjective
indicators of economic uncertainty (Bhaumik and Nugent 2011, Fahlén and Oláh 2018, Hofmann
and Hohmeyer 2013, Kreyenfeld 2010, Kreyenfeld et al. 2012, Witte and Wagner 1995, Novelli et
al. 2020, Vignoli et al. 2020a, 2020b). Economic and labour market deterioration is associated with
an increase in perceived economic insecurity and occupational instability, and the individuals’
perception and expectation may be of particularly relevance for fertility intentions on top of
objective economic conditions (Busetta et al. 2019, Modena et al. 2013). As highlighted in the
literature (e.g., Testa and Basten 2014), in fact, perceptions and expectations even more than the
actual impact of the recession on individuals’ current occupational and income conditions can shape
6

fertility plans. Thus, our study focuses on the subjective dimensions of economic uncertainty,
intended as individuals’ expectations about their future income and occupational insecurity.
The multiplying effect of recessions on uncertainty has been particularly intense for the crises of the
last 50 years (Testa and Basten 2014), because the uncertainty due to the recessions summed up
with a widespread general feeling of vulnerability brought by the globalization process (Mills and
Blossfeld 2005). Thus, economic uncertainty has become an important factor for explaining fertility
postponement and decline since the 1980s (Sobotka 2003, Kreyenfeld et al. 2012, Comolli 2017,
Comolli et al. 2020, Vignoli et al. 2020b, Comolli and Vignoli 2021, Matysiak et al. 2021,
Hofmann et al. 2017). In Western societies in general, but especially in Southern European
countries, markets deregulation and the delocalization of economic activities (Hofmeister et al.
2006, Blossfeld et al. 2006) has increased economic and occupational uncertainty, which has been
found to be related with the postponement of the transition to parenthood and the reduction of
fertility (Kreyenfeld et al. 2012, Mills and Blossfeld 2013). Furthermore, the relationship between
economic uncertainty and fertility has become stronger over time and it has been especially
powered by the 2008 Great Recession. This happened in particular in countries, such as Italy, where
the institutions were unable to buffer the negative effects of the changes in the labour market due to
globalization (de-regulation, delocalization etc.) on the individuals’ perceptions of uncertainty
(Alderotti et al. 2019).
The Italian case
During the 1980s, the Italian labour market has witnessed a strong deregulation, characterized by
increasing forms of flexible and unstable employment usually consisting in jobs with limited
duration and low income (Emmenegger et al. 2012). These kinds of jobs are usually associated with
lower occupational prospects and careers (Barbieri & Scherer, 2009), higher risk of entering
poverty (Barbieri and Bozzon, 2016) and of turning into unemployment during recession periods
(Liotti 2020). Women and young individuals have been the groups of workers mostly affected by
these changes in the Italian labour market (Brandolini et al. 2007, Barbieri and Scherer 2005).
Moreover, as a long-lasting consequence of the 2008 financial crisis, the proportion of NEET
(young people Neither in Employment nor in Education or Training) has increased in Italy
(Amendola 2021). The vulnerability associated with the NEET condition is especially high in this
context, because the proportion of individuals in long-term unemployment or discouraged in the job
search (i.e., no longer actively looking for a job, but still available to work) is much higher in Italy

7

than in other European countries (Mascherini and Ledermaier 2016), where the NEET condition is
more often a temporary status.
Another factor that contributes creating an unfavourable context for fertility in Italy is related to
traditional gender roles (Arpino et al. 2015). Previous studies have widely documented the positive
relationship between female participation to the labour force and fertility behaviours and intentions
(e.g., Ahn and Mira 2002, Rindfuss et al. 2003, Engelhardt et al. 2004). However, in Italy female
labour force participation remains low (European Commission, 2019), also because of a lack of
accessible and affordable childcare services (Del Boca and Vuri 2007, Brilli 2017), which makes it
difficult to reconciliate work and family obligations (Barbieri et al. 2015).
In this context, where occupational vulnerability is a widespread condition among young people,
gender norms are not egalitarian and the welfare state is not supportive of families, fertility plans of
individuals with poor economic prospects are particularly at risk. In fact, Italian studies have found
that precarious job conditions are strongly related to fertility postponement (Vignoli et al. 2012,
2020a) and to reduced fertility intentions (Busetta et al. 2019, Modena and Sabatini 2012, Modena
et al. 2013).
The above described unfavourable pre-COVID context for fertility has been further worsened by
the pandemic. Italy has been the first country outside Asia to be severely hit by the pandemic and it
was also the first country to implement a nationwide lockdown in March 2020, which has been one
of the strictest and longest worldwide (Hale et al. 2020; Plümper and Neumayer 2020). Schools and
non-essential workplaces were closed, events and public gatherings were prohibited, as well as nonessential movements (Plümper and Neumayer 2020). Following lockdowns have been limited to
specific areas (communes or provinces), but restrictive measures have been adopted in in the whole
country in October 2020 to fight the second wave of the pandemic. These restrictive measures had
strong negative impacts on individuals’ psychological wellbeing (Arpino et al 2020; Orgilés et al.
2020), as well as on employment and income conditions and future prospects. While a global
economic contraction in the GDP for the year 2020 is estimated at 3.5%, this is expected to be even
stronger for the Euro area (7.2%) and for Italy in particular (9.2%; IMF 2021). In Italy the cushion
provided by the suspension of the layoffs have limited the short-term effects of COVID-19 on the
labor market (Colussi 2020). Therefore, there has not been an increase in the unemployment rate,
but national statistics (ISTAT 2021) report a drop in the percentage of employed individuals (-1.9
percentage points (pp) during the year 2020), largely due to fixed term contracts not being renewed.
8

Also, the percentage of economically inactive people has increased, especially among women (+2
pp, versus +1 pp for men) and individuals aged 25-34 (+8.3 pp, against an average of 3.8 pp for the
whole population). Some studies show that during the pandemic, Italians (Eurofound 2020), and
especially young Italians (Luppi and Rosina 2020), expected a negative impact of the COVID crisis
on their income, work and career. According to Luppi and Rosina (2020), in October 2020, almost
45% of women and 35% of men expected a drop in family income and work career because of the
recession.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on births and fertility intentions
Against the previous discussion on the role of economic uncertainty during recessions and on the
Italian context, a reduction in fertility can be expected. Studies on Italy and on other developed
countries have already shown some evidence of that (Cohen 2021, Li et al. 2021, Sobotka et al.
2021; Lindeberg et al. 2020, Luppi et al. 2020, Luppi and Rosina 2020, Guetto et al. 2020, Micelli
et al. 2020, Blangiardo 2021), while studies on low and medium-income countries (Emery and
Koops 2021, Zhu et al. 2020) found mixed effects of the pandemic on fertility intentions. In Italy,
first data released by ISTAT8 shows that, compared to the same months of the previous year, in
December 2020 the number of births declined by 10.3%; this is the first month in which the effects
of the first epidemic wave are observable. This trend has been anticipated by studies on fertility
intentions conducted soon after the beginning of the health emergency in March 2020. In particular,
Luppi and colleagues (2020) show that at the beginning of the health emergency in March 2020,
across European countries, a high proportion of young individuals of prime reproductive age (18-34
years old; Brzozowska and Beaujouan, 2020) were postponing or indefinitely suspending the
original intention of having a child during the 2020. In particular, in Italy the percentage of those
who (at least) temporarily abandoned the fertility plan for the year 2020 was much higher than in
France and Germany, and in general it was the highest in the group of countries included in the
study. Another study conducted in the same period (Micelli et al. 2020) on an Italian sample of
women and men (18-46 years old) found that 37% of the interviewed individuals who were
planning to have a child before the pandemic abandoned their plan, most of them because of
worries about future financial difficulties brought by the recession. On the same line, Guetto and
colleagues (2020), by conducting a survey on Italian individuals of reproductive ages and using
online experiments on shared narratives of the future, found that pre-pandemic fertility intentions
decrease with the increase of the expected length of the health emergency. The authors also argue
that a long-lasting economic recession may determine a possible drop in fertility, but that this effect

9

might became more visible after the second pandemic wave. All these studies, in fact, have been
conducted during the nationwide lockdown of March 2020.
Our study offers a twofold contribution to this preliminary evidence on the consequences of the
pandemic on fertility. First, we examine the heterogeneity in the consequences of the economic
uncertainty created by the pandemic on changes in fertility plans by studying the role of
experienced and expected income and occupational vulnerabilities due to the COVID-19 crisis in
Italy. Second, our analyses are not limited to the very first period of the pandemic as most previous
contributions, but we also exploit data collected in October and November 2020. Also, we exploit
pre-COVID data (2016) for the sake of comparing the pandemic context with a pre-pandemic
period.
Data and method
Data
Data used for the analyses come from the Rapporto Giovani survey, carried out by the Osservatorio
Giovani of Istituto Toniolo, in collaboration with IPSOS. The survey started in 2011 and uses
CAWI (Computer Assisted Web Interviewing) administered questionnaires. The survey includes
both regular and special cross-sectional waves: the regular module (the core of the study) is
repeated every year; the special modules are carried out as independent surveys on ad hoc topics. In
this paper, we exploit the COVID waves and a pre-COVID regular wave from the 2016 that is the
most recent pre-pandemic wave including a fertility intention question that is comparable to the
question included in the regular 2020 wave. In this way we exploit two different approaches to
assess changes in fertility plans during the COVID-19 pandemic based on: 1) retrospective
questions in the COVID waves; 2) repeated questions in October 2016 and November 2020 regular
modules.
The two special cross-sectional COVID waves have been administered on independent samples of
individuals between March 27-31and again in October 5-14 2020. In all surveys, individuals are
chosen with a quota sampling technique targeting the young population (18-34 years old
individuals) ensuring the representativeness with respect to a significant set of key variables
(gender, age, geographical origin, education, marital status, etc.) on which the quotas are defined 9.
We select our working samples by excluding full-time students because they represent a nonhomogeneous category of individuals, including both those who just started their academic studies
and those who are about to exist the educational system. Additionally, we do not have information
9 More information is available at: https://www.rapportogiovani.it/osservatorio/

10

on whether they are actively looking for a job. This information would be relevant because students
might give a very different meaning to the expectation about the impact of the current crisis on their
future occupation and financial situation, depending on how close they plan to enter the labour
market. By excluding students, the sample sizes were 4573 (wave 2016), 4580 (wave 2020), 1491
(COVID-wave March 2020), and 1492 (COVID-wave October 2020). Then, the regular waves
(2016 and 2020) have been pooled and only individuals with intentions to conceive within 3 or 2
years have been considered for the multivariate analyses (N = 3286). The COVID waves have also
been pooled and only individuals who declared to have a plan to conceive a child in January 2020
have been selected (N = 758). More details on the samples’ composition are available in the Results
section.
Dependent variable based on the 2016 and 2020 regular waves
To compare the 2016 and 2020 fertility intentions we consider the short-term intentions collected
through the question “Do you expect to conceive a child within the next 12 months?” with four
possible answers: “Surely not”, “Maybe not”, “Maybe yes” and “Surely yes”. The question has
been asked only to individuals who answered that they intend to conceive a child in the following 3
years (in the 2016 survey) or 2 years (in the 2020 survey). This different time frame might imply a
possible overestimation of fertility intentions in 2016. However, these data provide a good measure
on the short-term intention of conceiving a child. Although these questions are not strictly
comparable because of the different time horizon, the sub-questions using a 1-year time frame are
comparable and we focus on them.
Dependent variable based on the COVID waves
In order to get information on respondents’ fertility plans before the COVID-19 emergency, the
following question has been asked:
a. “At the beginning of the year [2020], i.e., shortly before the coronavirus emergency broke

out, were you planning to conceive/have a baby before the end of 2020?”, using the possible
alternatives [1a] “No”, [2a] “I was considering it but without having planned it”, [3a] “Yes, I
had planned it”. Only for the October wave a further possible answer has been added [4a]
“Yes, I’ve both planned and realized it”, for those who were able to conceive a child during
2020.

11

Respondents who declared to be planning to have a child during the 2020 (i.e., answers [2a] or [3a]
in the March wave; answer [3a] in the October survey), have also been asked the following
question:
b. “Did the coronavirus emergency interfere in any way with this program?” with three

possible answers: [1b] “No, the program remains confirmed for 2020”; [2b] “The program
remains confirmed but I had to postpone it”; [3b] “For now I have quit the program”.
Therefore, our second dependent variable is a three-level categorical variable corresponding to the
following groups of individuals:

conceive/having a child during the 2020 and that confirmed their plan [1b] (i.e., stillplanners);

II.

those who were planning or were considering the idea to conceive/having a child during the
2020 and that postponed the plan [2b] (i.e., postponers);

III.

those who were planning or were considering the idea to conceive/having a child during the
2020 and that have quitted the plan [3b] (i.e., abandoners).

Notice that, obviously, in the October wave, those who reported to have already realized the
original plan have no counterpart in the March wave and have been considered together with those
who confirmed the original fertility plan. Also, the filter to the question on the confirmed and
revised fertility plans changed between the two survey waves. In March, this question has been
asked to both those who – in January 2020 – declared strong [3a] and weaker intentions [2a] to
conceive a child during the next 12 months; in October, the question has been asked only to those
with strong intentions [3a]. In the following, we will focus on the “enlarged” sample that includes
those with weaker intention in March 2020. However, we have considered a robustness check on
the “restricted” sample that only includes those with stronger intentions both in March and October
2020. Additionally, because there might be a selection among those who retrospectively declared to
have fertility plans in January 2020, further robustness checks have been implemented by modelling
the probability of being among those with no fertility plans in January 2020 (all results from
robustness checks are in the Supplementary Materials).
Explanatory variables
The three main independent variables are represented by: 1) occupational status; 2) the self-reported
actual effect of the COVID-19 emergency on the respondent’s financial situation; 3) the perceived
12

expected effect on future personal income and occupation. While all the explanatory variables are
available in the COVID waves, in the regular 2016 and 2020 survey only occupational status is
available.
The occupational condition of the respondents, considering both the fact that they are working or
not and the level of protection of their occupation, is operationalized by classifying individuals in
three groups:
I.

those who are not working and not studying (NEET): they represent the most vulnerable
group in terms of personal income protection because they are out of the labour market. This
category includes both individuals actively looking for a job, those who are available to
work but they are not searching for a job (e.g., discouraged unemployed persons), and those
who are not available to work at the moment of the interview (e.g., because of care
responsibilities);

II.

those who are working as self-employed (excluding professionals), with a project-based
contract, causal workers and low-skilled autonomous workers: they are vulnerable both in
terms of income and occupation protection. Compared to employees with non-permanent
contracts, they tend to have lower wages and consequently lower social security
contributions. Also, they do not benefit from employment protection legislation (Brandolini
et al 2007);

III.

those who are working as employees (with either permanent or non-permanent contracts),
professionals and managers: they are those with the highest level of protection of both their
income and occupation. Clustering together employees with permanent and non-permanent
contracts is consistent with the evidence that the proportion of those still-planning,
postponing or abandoning the fertility plan for the 2020 is similar between the two groups10.

Regarding the self-reported effect on the financial situation, the question has been posed as follows:
“Compared to before the coronavirus emergency, your financial situation today: [1] has worsened a
lot; [2] has slightly worsened; [3] nothing has changed; [4] has slightly improved; [5] has improved
a lot”. The variable has been dichotomized taking value 1 in the case the respondents report their
financial situation as worsened and 0 otherwise.

10 Tests of differences between proportions did not reject the null hypothesis of equality between the proportions of
still-planning/postponing/abandoning individuals between the two groups of employees with and without a permanent
contract.

13

As for the expected future effects, respondents answered to the question “Thinking about your
future, do you think the current coronavirus emergency will have a positive or negative impact on:
your (personal) income / your occupation?” on a scale scoring from 1 (much negative) to 5 (much
positive). The variable has been dichotomized, taking value 0 if the respondents expect a positive
effect or null effect (values 3, 4 and 5), and value 1 in case the respondents expect negative returns
in terms of income /occupation (values 1 and 2).
Control variables
We control for the age of the respondent dividing the age range into 3 intervals (i.e., 18-24; 25-29;
30-34) to better catch possible life-cycle effects. Additionally, we also control for the marital status
(married and cohabiting individuals vs other conditions), the presence of children in the household,
and education (having or not a tertiary level degree). Unfortunately, there is no information on age
and number of children. We also control for living in a geographical area characterized by high
level of diffusion of the COVID-19. Data on the diffusion of the COVID-19 have been collected at
the regional level (NUTS2). In particular, our indicator is the cumulated number of confirmed cases
of COVID-1911 on the total amount of the population in the region (per 1000 inhabitants). By
calculating the tertiles of the distribution, separately for the two survey waves, a control dummy
variable for living in a region with high number of cumulated cases of COVID-19 has been added
(regions above the second tertile). Both in March and in October, these regions were: Valle d’Aosta,
Emilia-Romagna, Liguria, Lombardia, Piemonte, Trentino Alto-Adige and Veneto.
Method
We implement two distinct modelling strategies to contrast fertility intentions before and after the
pandemic by exploiting data in the regular waves (2016-2020) and in the COVID waves (March
and October 2020). Given the ordered nature of the dependent variable measuring fertility
intentions available in the regular waves, we use generalized ordered logit models by polling the
two samples and including the occupational status – interacted with the survey year – as the main
explanatory variable and the socio-demographic controls previously mentioned.

Instead, the categories of the second dependent variable on whether pre-pandemic fertility plans
have been confirmed, postponed or abandoned do not follow a natural order. Therefore, data from
the COVID waves, have been analysed using multinomial models. In this way, it is also possible to
assess the separate effects of explanatory variables on each category of the dependent variable. In
order to use a larger sample size, the analyses are conducted by pooling the March and October
waves and controlling for the timing of the survey (reference: March 2020). We first run a model
that includes all control variables and the occupational status. Then, additional models add in turn
one of the subjective indicators of economic uncertainty. To test possible differences in the
relationship between our main independent variables and the categories of the dependent variable,
we add interactions between the main covariates and the wave indicator. We do not find statistically
significant results except for the occupational status. Therefore, while for the subjective indicators
of economic uncertainty results are presented without including the interaction with the wave, for
the occupational status the results for the interaction terms are shown.
To ease interpretation of findings, all results are presented graphically by showing predicted
probabilities. Full tables of estimated coefficients are available in the Supplementary Materials
(Tables from 3A to 7A).

Results
Descriptive statistics
In Table 1 and Table 2 we report the samples sizes and the distribution of the dependent variables in
the regular waves (2016 and 2020) and in the COVID waves (March and October 2020),
respectively. The distribution of the main covariates and the control variables are in the
Supplementary Materials (Tables 1A and 2A).
About the samples of the 2016 and 2020 regular waves, Table 1 shows that in 2016, almost 40% of
the respondents do intend to have a child in the following 3 years; in 2020 the percentage of
individuals who intend to have a child in the short-term (2 years) is about 32%. Among those with a
positive short-term (3 or 2 years) fertility intention, in 2016, about 36% intend to have a child
within 12 months (those answering probably or surely yes), while in 2020 this percentage is about
43%. If we calculate these percentages on the total samples (excluding students) we get very similar
values: 14.5% and 13.8%, respectively. Thus, the positive fertility intentions within 1-year are very
similar in 2016 and 2020.

15

Data from the pooled samples in the COVID waves (Table 2) show that almost 68% of the
respondents declare that they did not intention to conceive a child in the next 12 months in January
2020. Among the remaining 32%, the percentage of those confirming, postponing or abandoning
the fertility plans as a consequence of the pandemic occurrence has been calculated both in the
restricted and the enlarged samples. By comparing the restricted samples of March and October, we
contrast groups of respondents selected with the same criteria (i.e., including only those with a
precise fertility plan in January 2020), which checking the comparability of the two samples. In the
restricted sample we find that the distribution of changes in fertility plans is similar in the two
periods: in October, about 45.7% of the respondents (48.5% in March) confirms the original plan of
conceiving a child during the 2020, the rest of respondents intends to postpone or to indefinitely
abandon the original plan. The proportions of postponers and abandoners slightly vary between the
two surveys, with a little increase in the percentage of postponers (from about 27.3% to 37.4%) and
a correspondent decline for the abandoners (from about 24.2% to 16.9%).

Comparing the 2016 and 2020 fertility intentions in the regular waves
Although we do not observe substantial differences in fertility intentions between the 2016 and
2020 samples as it might be expected because of the 2020 COVID-19 emergency, a variation can be
found when looking at the occupational condition of the respondents. In particular, by running a
generalized ordered logit model for the intention to conceive a child in the following 12 months by
gender, we contrast the predicted probabilities of fertility intentions by occupation in 2016 and 2020
(complete models are in Supplementary Materials, Table 3A). Because we do not find significant
variations for the other categories of the outcome variable, Figure 1 shows the predicted
probabilities corresponding to the extreme category “surely yes”. The figure shows that the
generally most vulnerable workers (i.e., self-employed and temporary) in 2020 report a lower
17

probability of definitively intending to have a child in the short-term as compared to their
counterparts in the 2016. This pattern is evident for both genders, and it comes out as statistically
significant (at the 5% level) for women (with a predicted probability of 16% in 2016 vs 3% in
2020) and for men (at 10% level, with a predicted probability of 17% in 2016 vs 5% in 2020). On
the contrary, for those with a safer employment situation the probability of intending to have a child
“for sure” within the 12 months has not substantively (nor statistically significantly) changed for
men, and for women it is even slightly higher in 2020 than in 2016 (respectively 16% vs 11%,
significant at the 5% level).
Figure 1. Predicted probabilities of intending to have a(nother) child “surely yes” in the next 12 months by

Note: Predicted probabilities bases on a generalized ordinal logit model, controlling for age class, education, marital
status, presence of children, among those intending to have a child in the next 2 years (2020) or 3 years (2016). Full
results are available in Table 3A in Supplementary Materials. Displayed confidence intervals allow having an average
level of 10% for the Type I error probability in the pair-wise comparisons of predicted values. When differences of
interest are significant at the 5% level, this is noticed in the text.

Revised fertility plans in the COVID waves
We now turn to the COVID waves that allow examining self-reported changes in pre-COVID
fertility plans. We first examine whether the occupational status is associated with the probability to
confirm, postpone or abandon the fertility plan respondents had in January 2020, by gender (Figure
3, Model 1 in Table 6A and 7A in the Supplementary Materials). Figure 2 shows that in March a
more precarious occupational condition is associated (at the 5% level) with a higher chance of
abandoning the original plan compared to October. In particular, for women in March the
probability of abandoning the fertility plans is about 46% for self-employed and temporary workers
18

and 43% for NEET (vs 29% for employees). Correspondently, a lower probability to confirm the
pre-COVID plans arises in March (19% for self-employed and temporary workers, 26% for NEET
vs 36% for employees). In October the probability for women to abandon the fertility plan is 16%
for both the vulnerable occupation categories, and it is no longer significantly different from the
same probability for the employees. For men, the chances of abandoning the plan for self-employed
and temporary workers are significantly higher in March (54%) than in October (16%) and
compared to the other two occupational categories in March (NEET 28% and employees 23%),
while the difference is no longer significant in October. Finally, the probability to confirm the
fertility plan is lower for self-employed and temporary workers in March (9%) compared to October
(38%) and to NEET (26%) and employees (33%) in March.

Figures 3 to 5 show the results from models where the subjective indicators of economic
uncertainty have been added one by one (complete estimates are reported in Tables 4A and 5A,
Models from 2 to 4, of the Supplementary Materials). For both genders, but especially for women,
Figure 3 shows an association between having experienced a drop in the income and the changes in
fertility plans (confidence interval for pair-wise comparisons at 5% level). In particular, individuals
who report a worsened financial situation display a higher probability to abandon their fertility
19

plans for the 2020 as compared to individuals who did not experience such an income shock
(respectively 36% vs 21% among women and 30% vs 20% among men). Among women, a
worsened financial situation is also negatively associated with the probability of confirming the
fertility plan (32% for those who did experience worsened financial situation vs 43% for those who
did not).

Finally, Figures 4 and 5 present results regarding the expectations about the future effect of the
recession on the individual’s occupation and income, respectively (confidence interval at 5% level).
Women who perceive their occupation as at risk because of the COVID-19 crisis are less likely to
confirm their pre-crisis fertility plans as compared to their counterparts who do not hold such a
negative expectation (respectively 34% vs 42%, Figure 4). Correspondingly, women who expect
their occupation to be at risk show a considerably higher probability of declaring to abandon their
original fertility plans for the 2020 (respectively 32% vs 24%, Figure 4). Similarly, both women
and men who perceive their future income to be at risk due to the COVID-19 crisis show a lower
probability of confirming and a higher probability of abandoning the pre-pandemic fertility plan
(Figure 5). More specifically, the probability of abandoning the pre-COVID fertility plan for
women who expect the pandemic to produce a negative shock on their income in the future is 36%
20

against 23% for those who do not hold such a negative expectation. For men, we observe a slightly
lower but still sizeable gap (29% vs 20%).

Conclusion
A wide interest on the consequences of the COVID-19 emergency on fertility has arisen worldwide
in the scientific community since the beginning of the pandemic. Prediction about drops in births
have been largely shared in the demographers’ community (e.g., Lappegard et al. 2020, Lindberg et
al. 2020, Luppi et al. 2020, Micelli et al. 2020, Ullah et al. 2020, Wilde et al. 2020) and preliminary
data from birth statistics confirm a drop in the birth rates 8-9 months after the beginning of the
health emergency in Italy (Blangiardo 2021), as well as in the US and several other European and
Asian countries (Cohen 2021; Sobotka et al. 2021). In Italy, the very low fertility level was already
a concern for demographers and policy makers before the pandemic. Hence, a possible further
decline in fertility due to the COVID-19 health and economic crisis would posit new challenges to
the holding of both the economic development and the welfare state in the medium term. This is
particularly worrying given that the new COVID-related recession sums up in Italy to the effects of
the 2008 Great Recession, further compromising the life plans of what has been called the “lost
generation” (Bell and Blanchflower 2010).
Despite the great interest that fertility behaviours have traditionally attracted when exploring the
demographic consequence of economic and health crises, fertility intentions are highly informative
in the short-term, in part because changes in fertility behaviours need longer time to be detected, but
also because by investigating the intentions it is possible to consider in which way people are
revising their fertility plans (Testa and Basten 2014). In this study, fertility intentions have been
examined in two alternative ways: 1) using the classical intention to conceive a child in the
following 12 months, before and during the pandemic; 2) distinguishing confirmed, postponed or
abandoned (i.e., indefinitely suspended) fertility plans for those who, before the pandemic, were
planning to conceive a child in 2020. In particular, we were able to distinguish those who are
postponing their pre-COVID plan from those who abandoned it. This is important because we may
expect that postponers will more likely delay the childbirth to a next future, while for the
abandoners both the scenarios of a long-term delay and of a withdrawal are plausible. This last
group of individuals can be considered particularly vulnerable, as their fertility plans seem to be
more easily compromised by the crisis. This interpretation is supported by our results, which show a
22

clear association between higher levels of economic uncertainty and higher chances to abandon the
fertility plan.
From a methodological point of view, using two alternative approaches to examine the effect of
COVID-19 on fertility intentions have strengthened the validity of our findings. In fact, the two
approaches differ not only with respect to the question used to assess fertility intentions but also
with respect to the design of the analysis. More specifically, we exploited both independent samples
drawn before (2016) and during the pandemic (2020; “regular waves”) and retrospective
information collected during the pandemic on pre-COVID fertility plans (“COVID waves”
collected at the beginning of the health emergency in Italy - March 2020 - and before the adoption
of the containment measures for the second wave of the epidemic - October 2020).
In Italy, occupational categories have been hit differently by the economic crisis, with selfemployed and temporary workers much more affected than employees, at least in the 2020
(Eurofound 2020).
Consistently with this, by comparing the short-term fertility intentions (within 12 months) among
similar samples of young individuals in 2016 and 2020, we find that individuals with more
vulnerable occupations show a lower probability of definitely intending to have a(nother) child
soon. For self-employed and temporary workers, the changes in the fertility intentions between the
two considered time points are considerable from a substantive point of view: from 16% to 3% for
women, and from 17% to 5% for men. This indicates that, in periods of recession, fertility plans are
more at risk for individuals who experience greater occupational uncertainty, and especially among
women. This result contrasts the often reported finding that women invest more in childbearing
during periods of economic uncertainty to substitute the loss of employment opportunities
(Liefbroer and Corijn 1999, Andersson 2000, Adsera 2011, Vikat 2004, Gonzalez and Jurado 2006,
Schmitt 2008). This might suggest an increasing similarity between women and men behaviours
among the young generations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, in fact, among women the income
effect (i.e., economic uncertainty inhibiting the demand for children) exceeds the substitution effect
(i.e., economic uncertainty facilitating childbearing as unemployment increases the time for
childcare). However, previous studies also show that the substitution effect prevails when the
perceived employment and income fragility is perceived as a temporary condition; on the contrary,
the income effect might be stronger when the perceived and experienced “unemployment trap” lasts
longer (Adserà 2004, 2011, Bossert and D’Ambrosio 2013). Therefore, this might suggest a “scare-

23

effect” (Schmitt 2012) of possible long-term negative consequences of the COVID-crisis on the
youth labour market in Italy.
To understand the role of economic uncertainty brought by the COVID-19 pandemic and given that
the COVID-19 pandemic is not egalitarian in its effects, we compared those who decided to
indefinitely suspend their fertility plans as a consequence of the pandemic to those who postponed
or confirmed the original fertility plan, by looking at both objective and subjective indicators of
economic uncertainty. In particular, we found that individuals who are more vulnerable in terms of
occupational and financial conditions are more prone to indefinitely suspend the plan to conceive a
child in the short term. Working under unstable conditions or even not working, experiencing or
expecting a drop in income, and perceiving occupation as at risk, are among the characteristics
associated with a higher probability to abandon the fertility plans for the 2020. Consistently with
results from other studies (Vignoli et al. 2020a), women more than men tend to abandon the fertility
plans for the 2020 when they experience or perceive an occupational and income vulnerability.
However, differences across occupational categories appear only for data collected at the beginning
of the health emergency – in March 2020 – while in October of the same year such differences are
no longer present. This suggests that, at least before the second pandemic wave, the impact of the
crisis on fertility plans tends to become more homogeneous across occupational groups, while the
specific individual economic conditions (having or not being economically affected by the crisis)
and expectations are equally relevant in both periods as our findings show. For example, the
probability of abandoning the pre-COVID fertility plan for women who expect the pandemic to
produce a negative shock on their income in the future is 36% against 23% for those who do not
hold such a negative expectation (for men: 29% vs 20%).
The (qualitatively) different results we find for occupational status using the regular waves and the
COVID-waves might also in part be related to the specific timing of the waves. The first COVIDwave was carried out in March 2020 during a strict lockdown where most shops and many
economic activities were closed. Data for the second COVID-wave, instead, were collected in
October after the relatively quiet summer, for what the pandemic dynamic is concerned, and in a
period where more economic activities were operating compared to March. The regular 2020 wave
was implemented in November, which can be considered both in terms of pandemic and economic
conditions as in-between the March and October 2020 periods. Further studies, with longer periods
of observation, might focus on the fertility intentions trends following the development of the health
crisis, for example considering a possible impact of the vaccination campaign.
24

A limitation of our data is that they are restricted to young individuals aged 18-34. Although this is
one of the groups that most likely experienced the negative economic consequences of the
pandemic in Italy (Arpino et al. 2020; Eurofound 2020), in case older individuals’ objective or
subjective economic circumstances have been affected the consequences on their fertility plans
might be even stronger (Beaujouan et al. 2019). Additionally, because of the data constrain, we only
focused on the negative impact of the pandemic on fertility plans; in other words, we did not
consider those who did not have a plan to conceive a child in 2020 in the pre-pandemic period but
changed their mind during the health emergency. Micelli and colleagues (2020) in fact, report a
small but significant proportion of individuals who revealed a new desire for parenthood during the
first lockdown (11.5%), and the 4.3% of them also tried to conceive a child during that period
because, for example, they were valuing more their family investment and the time spent with the
partner/children. There might be some cases in which the teleworking opportunities spread by the
epidemic had favoured the work-family reconciliation, even though the average net effect of the
health emergency was detrimental on the work-family balance, especially on the women’s side (Del
Boca et al. 2020).
Despite the limitations, our findings have important policy implications. In periods of great
uncertainty, such as the period during the COVID-19 pandemic and those that will follow it,
exploring fertility intentions gives a great advantage to policy makers for reducing the potential
negative impact of the crisis on fertility, especially in those countries where fertility decline was an
issue even before the pandemic occurrence. Fertility realizations to be observed need longer time
span, especially if we aim to find the characteristics associated with higher chances of
postponement and withdrawal from the original fertility plans. For this reason, because fertility
intentions in our study have been operationalized exactly as the intention to confirm, postpone or
abandon the original fertility plan, we have a more precise idea on the level of vulnerability
associated to the fertility plan as perceived by the individual. Our findings clearly point to the fact
that the unequal economic consequences of the pandemic also produced and will produce
heterogeneous effects on fertility. Policy makers who aim at contrasting the possibly persistent
COVID shocks on fertility should implement labor market and family policies that allow the
individuals to plan irreversible important childbearing choices with a less uncertain horizon. In this
respect, the 2021 Italian universal child allowance (AUUF – “Assegno Unico e Universale per i
Figli”) has been adopted with the aim of creating more favourable conditions for childbearing; the
allowance supports the financial investment for rearing children from the 7 th month of pregnancy to
25

21 years, it is only partially income-based (i.e., there is a minimum which is universally provided)
and it increases with the second child. This income-support policy should represent the starting
point of the implementation of the so-called “Family Act”, which aims at improving policies and
tools for work-family reconciliation and childcare services. This policy intervention follows a
similar set of measures that have been adopted in Germany starting from 2012; at that time, despite
the country had been marginally hit by the Great Recession and its economy and labour market
were highly performant, the German fertility rate was among the lowest in Europe. The adoption of
a universal allowance for children, together with the empowerment of the parental leave system and
the childcare services, has strongly pushed fertility rate upwards (Bauernschuster et al. 2016).
Because of the expected – and partially already experienced – negative effect of the COVID-19
recession on births in many developed countries, those countries that were already experiencing
pre-pandemic downward fertility trends are now in the urgent need to create more favourable
conditions for childbearing, avoiding that the postponement due to the recession would end into a
further fertility decline.

(a) “Compared to before the coronavirus emergency, your financial situation today: [1] has worsened a lot; [2] has
slightly worsened; [3] nothing has changed; [4] has slightly improved; [5] has improved a lot”. The variable has been
dichotomized taking value 1 in the case the respondent reports their financial situation as worsened and 0 otherwise.
(b) “Thinking about your future, do you think the current coronavirus emergency will have a positive or negative impact
on: your (personal) income / your occupation?” on a scale scoring from 1 (much negative) to 5 (much positive). The
variable has been dichotomized, taking value 0 if the respondent expects a positive effect or null effect (values 3, 4 and
5), and value 1 in case the respondent is expecting negative returns in terms of income /occupation (values 1 and 2).

Robustness checks
Stronger and weaker retrospective fertility intentions
Here we tested the differences in proportions (for categorical variables) and the differences in
means (for continuous variables) across enlarged and restricted samples, contrasting them on our
predictors and control variables.
Results from the tests show there is no differences between the two groups in terms of age, gender,
proportion of those having a tertiary degree, or living in a region with high or low spread of
COVID-19 cases. However, those with stronger retrospective fertility intentions are more probably
married (PrH0=0.002) with at least one child (PrH0=0.08), and with a “safer” occupational condition
as they are more probably employees (Pr H0=0.005), while those with weaker intentions share a
higher probability of being self-employed or temporary workers (PrH0 = 0.02).
A further check has been done by performing the multinomial model on both the restricted and the
enlarge samples. Results are reported in Table 8A.

fertility plan, in the restricted and the enlarged samples (Data source: Rapporto Giovani COVID survey, March

The selection into the “no plans” group
We might think that, even in January 2020 (before the occurrence of the pandemic), young people
perceiving their income or occupation as vulnerable – and so independently by the crisis – were less
prone to plan the arrival of a child during the next 12 months. This would imply a selection in the
sample of those answering about their revised fertility plans due to the COVID-19 emergency. In
this case, in fact, they would represent a less vulnerable sub-sample in terms of perspective
financial consequences of the economic crisis.
To explore whether the hypothesis of as sample selection based on perceived economic and
occupational vulnerability is valid, we run a set of logistic models (see Table 9A). In the Model 1
we include the occupational status, plus a set of control variables with only the socio-demographic
characteristics and the residence in a region with a high diffusion of the COVID-19. In the Model 2,
Model 3 and Model 4 we add, one by one, the covariates related to the economic and occupational
vulnerability: respectively, the occupation perceived as at risk, the income perceived at risk and the
actual impact of the crisis on the individual’s financial situation. We run separate models for
women and men, to consider the possible different moderation of gender12.
12 We also performed the same analyses on the pooled sample of women and men, including interactions between the
predictors and the gender dummy variable. However, results were often not enough statistically relevant to be
interpreted.

51

According to our selection hypothesis, the probability of being no-planners is higher when people
perceive their income at risk, for both genders (Model 3) and for men also in the case in which they
already experience an income loss (Model 4). However, when occupation is seen as vulnerable, this
affects fertility plans more on the female than on the male side (Model 2).
