ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic has required the adoption of new precautionary health behaviours to
reduce the risk of infection. This study examines adherence to four key precautionary behaviours
among Canadian adults: wearing face masks, increasing the frequency of hand washing,
practicing social distancing, and avoiding large crowds. Data are drawn from the Canadian
Perspective Survey Series 3: Resuming Economic and Social Activities During COVID-19,
administered by Statistics Canada in June 2020. Weighted descriptives calculate overall
adherence levels and logistic regressions models of each behaviour as a function of
demographics and socioeconomic status identify vulnerable segments of the population. We find
a nearly universal increase in hand washing (94%) and high adherence to social distancing and
avoiding crowds (82% and 84% respectively). Adherence to the use of face masks is much lower
(67% on average); moreover, there are significant disparities in their use. Women, older adults,
immigrants, and urban residents are much more likely to adhere to mask wearing, and other
precautionary behaviours, than men, younger adults, Canadian-born, and rural residents.
Canadian adults with a university degree are also the most likely to wear face masks and avoid
large crowds. The most significant disparities in the use of COVID-19 precautions are found
across demographic characteristics. These estimates have substantial implications for policy and
potential public health interventions.

INTRODUCTION:
The COVID-19 pandemic has required Canadians to adopt new precautionary health behaviours.
The virus is highly transmittable, with moderate to severe illness reported in approximately 20%
of all cases (Kucharski et al. 2020; Riou and Althaus 2020). According to the World Health
Organization (WHO 2020), wearing face masks, increasing the frequency of hand washing,
practicing social distancing, and avoiding large crowds are the primary means of reducing the
risk of infection. These behaviours represent the most important actions that Canadians can take
to help fight the pandemic. As a result, research is required to understand rates of adherence to
these precautions in the Canadian population, as well as disparities in adherence, in order to
assess potential vulnerabilities across various segments of the population.
While hand hygiene and social distancing are important behaviours, wearing a face mask is
particularly vital as it significantly reduces transmission of the virus (Brankston et al. 2020).
Wearing a mask is predominately seen as a behaviour aimed at protecting others, rather than our
own self-interests (Adeel et al. 2020; van der Linden and Savoie 2020). In fact, a recent online
poll found that the majority of Canadian respondents (87%) believed wearing a mask to be a
civic duty as it protects others from the risk of infection (Berthiaume 2020). However, maskwearing in countries around the world ranges from 1% in Denmark and Finland to over 90% in
Singapore and the Philippines, as adherence is greatly influenced by government regulations
(CFR 2020). Canadian mask usage has gradually increased from 10% at the start of the pandemic
in March 2020 to approximately 63% in late May (Mohammed, Johnston, and van der Linden
2020). The gradual change reflects shifts in the importance attributed to mask usage by public
health officials. Moreover, compliance has also been found to increase as a result of more
aggressive public health policy initiatives (Armstrong, Lebo, and Lucas 2020).

It is also critical to assess differences among population groups in adherence to precautionary
behaviours. During the SARS outbreak in the UK, Bish and Michie (2010) found being older,
female, more educated, and non-White to be associated with a higher likelihood of adopting
precautionary behaviours such as hand washing, wearing face masks, and avoiding crowds. The
use of precautions during the COVID-19 pandemic has also been found to vary across population
subgroups. For example, some recent evidence from Canada suggests women and older adults
are more likely than men and younger adults to follow government recommended health
behaviours during the pandemic (Brankston et al. 2020; Clark et al. 2020). A recent study also
found that immigrant, urban residence, single dwelling home, and higher educated Canadians are
more likely to practise social distancing, compared to non-immigrant, rural residence, and less
educated Canadians (Chan 2020). Moreover, respondents living in more urban areas also report
higher levels of mask use, compared to rural areas where mask use is particularly low (Brankston
et al. 2020). While these recent studies are not nationally representative, the findings support the
need to conduct a comprehensive analysis on the use of precautions both in aggregate and across
demographics and measures of socioeconomic status.
The present study uses recently released data on behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic to
assess the use of health precautions. We provide national estimates on the prevalence of
precautionary behaviours across the Canadian adult population. We also assess differences by
demographics and socioeconomic status in order to identify vulnerable segments of the
population that may require public health intervention. Demographic characteristics and
measures of socioeconomic status reflect structural positions and influences that define our
exposure to various health-related norms and customs, which in turn shapes our health-related
behaviours (Burdette et al. 2017; Mollborn et al. 2014; Ross, Hill, and Mirowsky 2016).

METHODS
Data:
The data for our analyses are from the Canadian Perspective Survey Series 3: Resuming
Economic and Social Activities During COVID-19 (CPSS-3), administered by Statistics Canada.
The purpose of the survey was to collect information about a wide range of social and economic
conditions as Canada continued to navigate the pandemic restrictions. Data were collected
between June 15th and June 21st, 2020. The sampling frame includes Canadians aged 15 and
older across the ten provinces; the institutionalized population and residents of the Yukon,
Northwest Territories, and Nunavut are excluded from the sample frame. The data were collected
using short online surveys with a sample size of 4,209 respondents.
We define the target population as Canadian adults aged 25 and over. We exclude 203
respondents (4.8% of total) age 15-24 because this age category comprises adolescents and
young adults with incomplete measures of socioeconomic status, such as educational attainment
and employment. We further exclude 67 respondents (1.6% of total) with missing responses on
their use of COVID-19 precautions or employment status. The final analytic sample size includes
3,939 respondents.
Measures:
Outcomes
The data include information about four precautionary behaviours including wearing face masks,
washing hands “more frequently,” practising social distancing, and avoiding large crowds. These
behaviours were assessed with the question “Which of the following precautions will you take or
continue to take as the COVID-19 safety measures are relaxed?” with respondents being able to
answer “yes” or “no” for each behaviour.

5

Covariates
Demographic characteristics include gender (male as reference), age groups (originally coded in
10-year groups from 25-34 to 75+; included in all models as a categorical variable: 25 to 44 as
reference, 45 to 64, and 65+), immigrant status (Canadian-born as reference versus foreignborn), urban as reference versus rural residence, marital status (married/common-law as
reference, previously married, and single), and the presence of children (no children under 18 at
home as reference versus at least one child at home). Socioeconomic status was captured using
level of education (high school or less as reference, trades certificate, college diploma, and
university degree), dwelling type (single detached as reference, low-rise apartment, high-rise
apartment, and other), and employment status coded with employed as reference, absent from
work, and not employed. The ‘absent’ category distinguished whether the absence was COVIDrelated or not; we combined the two categories because the two groups were small and did not
significantly differ.
Statistical Analysis:
We first describe the distribution of all variables in the target population (Table 1). We then
estimate a series of bivariate logistic regression models for each precaution and each covariate to
identify gross intergroup differences (Table 2). To better interpret the results from these models,
we calculate average adjusted probabilities from the estimated odds ratios and present the
findings graphically for the demographic characteristics (Figure 1a) and by socioeconomic status
(Figure 1b). Finally, we estimate fully adjusted logistic regression models for each precaution,
which include all controls. The analyses are all weighted to adjust for the complex sampling
design of the CPSS.

RESULTS
Table 1 provides weighted descriptive statistics for all variables in this study. The results indicate
substantial variability in the use of recommended COVID-19 precautions among Canadian
adults. Washing hands more frequently has the highest rate of adherence (94%), followed by
avoiding crowds (84%) and social distancing (82%). Wearing face masks has the lowest rate of
adherence, with only approximately 67% of the population reporting the use of face masks.
These differences have important policy implications, particularly as these behaviors remain the
most prominent means of slowing the spread of the virus across the country.
[insert Table 1 here]
Table 2 provides bivariate logistic regression results which is estimated separately for each
precaution and population group, with odds ratios shown. The estimates indicate gender, age
group, immigrant status, urban versus rural residence, level of education, and employment status
have the most prominent interpopulation group disparities. To provide an easy-to-interpret
output, we convert the estimates into predicted probabilities of adopting COVID-19 precautions
for each of those groups. The probabilities are plotted in Figures 1a & 1b, along with
corresponding 95% confidence intervals.
[insert Table 2 here]
Figure 1a displays bivariate predicted probabilities for gender, age group, immigrant status, and
urban versus rural residence. The results indicate significant intergroup disparities in the use of
precautions, particularly in the use of face masks. Female, older, immigrant, and urban residence
adults are the most likely to wear face masks, compared to male, younger, non-immigrant, and
rural residence adults. Probabilities of practicing social distancing and avoiding large crowds
follows a similar pattern, with the exception of adults living in either urban or rural areas where

7

the use of these precautions do not significantly differ. Increased hand washing has the least
variation in probabilities within population groups; however, female and older adults are still
more likely to have increased their hand washing, compared to male and younger adults.
[insert Figure 1a here]
Figure 1b includes predicted probabilities for level of education and employment status.
Canadian adults with a trades certificate and those currently employed are the least likely to wear
face masks, compared to adults with a university degree and those who are either absent from
work or not employed. Adults with a trades certificate are also the least likely to practice social
distancing, avoid large crowds, and wash their hands more frequently. Collectively, these
findings indicate that the Canadian adult population with a trades certificate consistently have the
lowest probabilities of adopting any of the COVID-19 precautions which represents an important
population group for public health interventions.
[insert Figure 1b here]
Table 3 presents fully adjusted logistic regression models estimating the use of each precaution,
with odds ratios shown. The models include all covariates in order to examine how these
measures effect the bivariate intergroup differences. The results indicate that the use of face
masks continues to have the greatest disparities across the adult population. In contrast,
differences in frequency of hand washing, practising social distancing, and avoiding large
crowds are attenuated after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.
However, large disparities continue to be found for gender where women are between
approximately 50% (social distancing and avoiding crowds) and 150% (hand washing) more
likely to use COVID-19 precautions, compared to men. Adults over the age of 65 are also

8

between approximately 110% (hand washing) and 135% (avoiding crowds) more likely to use
COVID-19 precautions, compared to younger adults.

DISCUSSION
COVID-19 health precautions remain a critical component for reducing the risk of infection and
slowing the spread of the pandemic. Government health officials continue to recommend
wearing face masks, increasing the frequency of hand washing, practicing social distancing, and
avoiding large crowds (Government of Canada 2020). We examined adherence to these
precautions, and disparities by demographics and measures of socioeconomic status, in order to
identify vulnerable segments of the Canadian adult population. These estimates have substantial
implications for policy and potential public health interventions.
The overall adherence among Canadian adults differed across the four precautionary behaviours.
Almost all Canadians (94%) report washing their hands more frequently, 84% avoid large
crowds, and 82% report social distancing. In contrast, only 67% of the adult population report
that they “Wear a mask in public places where physical distancing is difficult.”
The nearly universal compliance with increased hand washing may be overreported.
Borchgrevink, Cha, and Kim (2013) found people typically do not wash their hands as frequently
as they report. The survey question is also non-specific, as it does not clarify whether the
increase was overall or only after certain activities and captures not so much the level of hand
washing but increase since, presumably, before COVID-19.
Avoiding large crowds (84%) and social distancing (82%) also have relatively high rates of
adherence. As these are fairly similar behaviours, comparable rates of adherence to these
behaviours is expected. Wearing face masks has the lowest rate of adherence as only

9

approximately 67% of the adult population report wearing a mask. The proportion is similar to a
recent Canadian study that found 63% of respondents reported wearing masks during in late May
2020 (Mohammed, Johnston, and van der Linden 2020), but well below the proportions in
Singapore or the Philippines, where over 90% of adults wear a mask (CFR 2020). The low use of
face masks is especially problematic given how critical it is for reducing transmission of the
virus (Brankston et al. 2020) and for lowering mortality rates (WHO 2020).
We also found that the precautionary behaviors differed across population groups. With respect
to mask wearing, female, older, immigrant, and urban residents are more likely to wear face
masks compared to male, younger, non-immigrant, and rural residents. The observed pattern of
intergroup disparities is similar to other studies examining health behaviours in general (Cutler
and Lleras-Muney 2010; Baron et al. 2015). Based on these findings, the average prevalence of
mask wearing would be approximately 81% if all Canadians wore masks at the rate of the
highest compliers, compared to the actual 67%. Similar patterns of disparities are also found for
practising social distancing and avoiding large crowds. Increased hand washing is much more
consistent across all population groups; however, female and older adults are still significantly
more likely to have increased their hand washing, compared to male and younger adults.
Measures of socioeconomic status are also significant predictors of adherence to precautionary
behaviours. Canadian adults with a trades certificate are the least likely to adhere to all four
precautionary behaviors – in fact, they are only half as likely to wear masks, wash hands, engage
in social distancing, and avoiding crowds, compared to adults with a high school degree or less.
In contrast, adults with a university degree are most likely to wear a mask and avoid large
crowds. Significant disparities in the use of masks was also found among those employed,
compared to those who are either absent from work or not employed. This is consistent with a

10

recent study that found adults with lower levels of education to be significantly more likely to
engage in negative health behaviours, such as smoking, during the COVID-19 pandemic
(Zajacova et al. 2020). Across our measures of socioeconomic status, increased hand washing is
again much more consistent within population groups, except adults with a trades certificate are
still the least likely to wash their hands more frequently.
We also controlled for differences in both demographics and socioeconomic status for the
Canadian adult population in aggregate. Disparities in the use of precautions across demographic
characteristics remains consistent, while the pattern across measures of socioeconomic status is
attenuated. This is particularly evident across levels of education, which suggests differences in
demographic characteristics explain a significant proportion of intergroup disparities. Although,
adults with a university degree are still found to be more likely to wear face masks and avoid
large crowds, compared to less educated adults.
There are a few limitations to our findings. The data comes from a cross-sectional survey which
does not allow us to examine how the use of precautions may have evolved over time. The data
is also missing critical demographic characteristics (e.g., race and province) as well as measures
of socioeconomic status (e.g., income and occupation). The availability of these measures in
future waves of the data is encouraged.
CONCLUSION
Relatively high rates of adoption are found for most of the precautionary behaviours, particularly
for increasing the frequency of hand washing. However, significant improvements need to be
made in the use of face masks. As previously discussed, the average adoption rate would be
approximately 81% if all Canadians wore masks at the rate of the highest compliers. In order to
reach that rate of adoption, policymakers should target vulnerable segments of the population

11

including male, younger, non-immigrant, and rural residence adults. Potential public health
interventions should also account for the possible overreporting in the adoption of COVID-19
health precautions.
