"15" "Gaza is one of the most densely-populated areas around the world, with 2.1 million people living in a 140 square mile area (UN 2020; UNCTAD 2015). Gaza is 97.5% Muslim and two-thirds of its population live in refugee camps (World Population Review 2020). Under Israeli-Egyptian blockade since 2007, daily necessities and medical aid, supplies, and/or personnel cannot easily enter. After the 2014 conflict, the United Nations declared that Gaza may become uninhabitable by 2020 if prevailing economic trends persisted (UNCTAD 2020). The fourth quarter of 2019 reported a 43 percent unemployment rate and that 46 percent of the population was living below the US poverty line ($5.50 a day) (World Bank 2020). Since then, Gaza has not improved economically."
"16" "Researchers (Mills, David  et al.  2020) analyzed Gaza’s current economic status in relations to the COVID-19 pandemic. They concluded that the pandemic should be viewed as a preventable biosocial injustice in its struggle for health. Another researcher (Somdeep, Sen 2020) stated that countering the impact of the pandemic would assist Gaza with its development needs without having to contend with the (political) stigma of doing so. Since the blockade generally prevents entry of travelers or foreigners, the spread of COVID-19 to Gaza’s general population was minimized (Abuhabib, A.A.,  et al.  2020). In March 2020, Gaza quarantined its first COVID-19 cases at its borders. Some containment measures included a Gaza-wide lockdown and closure of mass-gathering locations, such as schools,  masajid  (mosques), wedding halls, parks, restaurants, etc."
"17" "Ramadan is the sacred month during which fasting is obligatory upon all healthy adult Muslims. It is anticipated due in part to its social events, communal evening meals, nightly congregational prayers at the  masjid , continuous community gatherings, and Ramadan-specific acts of worship (Hanif, S,  et al.  2020). On account of COVID-19, Saudi Arabia cancelled  umrah  (the small pilgrimage) in February 2020 (Ebrahim, Shahul and Memish, Ziad 2020). It then closed all  masajid  nationwide in mid-March, including the two most sacred sites for Muslims in Mecca and Medina, while recommending that all Muslims adhere to local COVID-19 containment measures."
"18" "This paper reflects upon the experiences of the author’s multi-generational family during the month of Ramadan, which took place from April 23 until May 23, 2020, in Gaza. The family consists of two  grandparents, fifteen children (both biological and -in-law), and fifty-six grandchildren  in shared buildings. Multigenerational living is typical in Gaza. Experiences were documented in notes, journal entries, digital photographs, videos, texts, and letters. The aim of this report is to analyze how Muslims adapted communal acts during Ramadan because of the COVID-19 pandemic. To interpret the data, a review of the Quran,  sunnah  (the actions and words of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him), and current academic literature was conducted."
"19" "Some of the WHO’s COVID-19 Ramadan recommendations were difficult to adhere to, such as (1) physical distancing of 1 metre between people at all times, as our family’s average household is 7.9 people (Gaza’s average is 5.5), and (2) avoiding kissing, hugging, and shaking hands as a greeting (which only one family did) (WHO, 2020; PCBS 2020)."
"20" "Although Gazan children and parents have high rates of PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) and anxiety due to exposure to war and Gazan children’s anxiety problems increase with age, with low socioeconomic status as the strongest predictor of general mental health problems, mental and psychological health was successfully promoted (Thabet, A.A,  et al.  2008; Thabet, A.A.M and Vostanis, P 1998). Only two family members expressed some COVID-19 cautiousness (not mental distress). Gratitude ensued with sincere hugs, cheerful smiles with each  salaam  (greeting of peace), and genuine care when inquiring how others were doing and listening to their answers."
"21" "Ramadan begins the evening the new moon is sighted (Sahih Muslim, 13:20. 1081a). Upon citing the moon, Muslims pray the first  taraweeh  (optional Ramadan prayer after the obligatory nighttime prayer,  ishaa ) in congregation at the  masjid  (Sunan Abu Dawud, 14:29).  Taraweeh  is highly encouraged as it expediates sins. It can also be done at home alone (Muslim, 8:197. 1188). The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not go to the  masjid  for  taraweeh  every night, demonstrating the prayer’s optional nature (Sahih Muslim, 6:211. 761). As an optional prayer, those at home typically pray alone, but this Ramadan male relatives of age took turns leading  taraweeh  and an educated elder gave short lectures and led discussions with the family, as conducted in the  masjid . Also similar to what customarily takes place at the  masjid , everyone socialized over sweets afterwards."
"22" "Since there are blessings in  suhoor  (pre-dawn meal before fasting), the Prophet (peace be upon him) would invite people to share the meal, as our family did (Sahih al-Bukhari, 30:32. 1923; Sunan an-Nasai’ 22:74 2163). Muslims are also encouraged to pray  fajr  in congregation and sit remembering Allah until the sun rises in order to gain rewards equivalent to those of performing pilgrimage (Jami’ at-Tirmidhi 6:43, 586). Multiple families stayed up for this one-hour-and-a-half period each dawn to read the Quran together. Typically a solitary act done in the  masjid , it was adapted to become a communal religious activity this Ramadan."
"23" "Muslims try to be as charitable as possible to emulate the Prophet (peace be upon him) as he was the most generous during Ramadan (Sahih al-Bukhari 1:6). Charitable acts done at home included cooking and baking for other families, tutoring and helping younger relatives with their at-home school work, teaching others Quran, and taking on new Islamic-centric hobbies like reading Islamic books, singing  nasheeds  (Islamic songs), and making Islamic art (such as Arabic calligraphy and hand-making Ramadan decorations). Some of the most creative and festive works, decorations, and gifts were witnessed this Ramadan."
"24" "With  masajid  closed for the five daily prayers and Friday’s congregational weekly prayer, homes transformed into family  masajid.  The family  imam  (the person who leads prayer) and  m'athin  (the one who makes the call to prayer) actively gathered everyone to pray together for the additional rewards (praying in congregation is more blessed) (Muslim. 5:349. 662). While daily prayers are sometimes prayed in congregation on normal days, all five prayers were prayed in congregation this Ramadan, increasing the amount of daily communal acts despite the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown."
"25" "Although the WHO recommended utilizing technology to replace the lack of communal rituals at the  masjid , it was already customary for Gazans to utilize technology for religious purposes (WHO, 2020). Gazans regularly watch livestreams of Mecca and Medina and the  athan  (call to prayer) can always be heard over the TV and radio and from local  masajid’s  loudspeakers. Additionally, app-based group chat Quranic and Islamic studies have been commonplace for many years, as have group video calls to overseas and local families. There was no shortage of resources for further religious inspiration or communal learning via technology this Ramadan."
"26" "Muslims have five rights upon other Muslims, and one is that they should accept invitations, such as those for  iftar  (Sahih al-Bukhari 23:4. 1240). Also, if one feeds a fasting Muslim, more blessings are bestowed upon them (Abu Dawud. 8:277. 1267). These two facts combined are why Muslims love to host  iftar  dinners. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, hosting  iftar  was discouraged and meals were sent as often as possible instead. Meals were oftentimes delivered as unannounced and warm surprises right before the sun set."
"27" "Women, children and elders found  iftar s during COVID-19 to be less stressful and calmingly celebratory. During Ramadan, male family members may eat  iftar  out of the house some nights, leaving a void in the house, or families may host others (sometimes multiple other families), making for hectic at-home  iftar s. Since Friday is Gaza’s weekend, Thursday night is the social evening. Each Thursday, the majority of our family (typically forty-four individuals) would join for a large  iftar  and  taraweeh . One particular Thursday, one male elder was able to get most of the family to show up resulting in an  iftar  and  taraweeh  of sixty-two people."
"28" "Muslims rush to perform more  ibadah  (acts of worship) in the last ten days of Ramadan while seeking the rewards of  Layal-tul-Qadr  (the Night of Power and Fate), the holiest night in the Islamic faith (Sahih al-Bukhari. 32:11. 2024; Qur'an 97:1-5; Bukhari. 32:7. 2020). Muslims try to perform  i'tikaf  (the practice of staying in the  masjid  and giving up worldly affairs during the final ten days and nights of Ramadan) (Bukhari 66:20. 6697). The Prophet (peace be upon him) would sleep little, call his family to join him during the last third of the night and lead prayer until  suhoor  (Jami’ at-Tirmidhi 8:125. 806). While performing  i'tikaf  was impossible this Ramadan, staying up all or most of the nights to perform  ibadah  with family was a wonderful alternative."
"29" "Layal-tul-Qadr  is most commonly known to be on the twenty-seventh night of Ramadan (Abu Dawud 5:725). On this night, one family invited forty-seven family members for  iftar  and  taraweeh . The evening included multiple Islamic lectures, supererogatory prayers led by the adult males of that family,  nasheed  performances by children, Quran recitations, Islamic skits, and plenty of homemade sweets and gifts. While women do go to  taraweeh  in Gaza, staying the night at the  masjid  is not typical, making this experience unique and memorable."
"30" "Some researchers (Hanif et al, 2020) shared that ceasing traditional Ramadan communal practices in the United Kingdom gave a sense of loss to the community, as many felt isolated, continued to worry about contracting COVID-19 or possibly losing loved ones, and feared financial stress. Hanif  et al  shared that despite socializing less, most surveyed found this Ramadan to be “less challenging” and “experienced less low mood than usual.” By adapting “new and creative ways to engage with the wider Muslim community,” Muslims were able to reflect and connect. Also forced to adapt this Ramadan, one New Yorker explained how she experienced the month like never before (Imber-Black, Evan 2020). She stated that she never understood why other Muslims felt sad when Ramadan ended until this year, as she “really got in touch with the blessings of this month.” Some Australians stated the positive effects of Ramadan during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, with one calling it the “best ever” (Tamer, Rayane 2020; Azlan, Neryssa and Erwin Renaldi, 2020; Azlan, 2020)."
"31" "Possible limitations to this field report are that: (1) Gaza was under limited lockdown during Ramadan. (2) The author is not Arab or fluent in Arabic and may have misunderstood or misinterpreted cultural and/or linguistic nuances."
"32" "Gazans adapted multiple communal acts during Ramadan due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In doing so, they epitomized the practice that charity must first start at home, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “(Giving) to a relative is two things: charity and upholding the ties of kinship” (Sunan an-Nasa’i 23:148. 2582). “He [the Prophet] used to keep himself busy serving his family…” and told Muslims to spend on their dependents first (Sahih al-Bukhari 10:70. 676; At-Tirmidhi 510)."
"33" "Maintaining  tawakkul  (trust in Allah) during difficult times enables Muslims to continue to illustrate resilience despite all odds. Gaza announced its first non-quarantined COVID‐19 case on August 24, 2020, enforcing its first strict 48-hour stay-at-home order (UN, 2020). Within that time, violence escalated between the Israeli government and Hamas, electricity was limited to four to six hours every twenty-four-hour period, bombings and surveillance increased, and land and water restrictions tightened. Gaza continues to endure worsening conditions and proves that the application of creative adaptations to the practice of faith (such as communal acts during lockdown) further fortifies faith."
"34" "Stated often in the Quran, reflection is seen as a great act of worship (Qur'an 59:18, 38:29, 51:20-21, 13:23). Reflecting on this past Ramadan, it is clear that Gaza’s faith and hope were more infectious than COVID-19. It is a hope that this report spreads that faith and hope to readers as well."
