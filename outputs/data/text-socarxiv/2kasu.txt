The impact of pandemic COVID-19
COVID 19 is observed in every sector around the world. The education
sectors of India as well as world are badly affected by this. It has enforced the world wide lock down
creating very bad effect on the students’
students’ life. Around 32 crore learners stopped to move
schools/colleges and all educational activities halted in India. The outbreak of COVID
COVID-19 has taught
us that change is inevitable. It has worked as a catalyst for the educational institutions to grow an
and opt
for platforms with technologies, which have not been used before. The education sector has been
fighting to survive the crises with a different approach and digitising the challenges to wash away the
threat of the pandemic. This paper highlights some measures taken by Govt. of India to provide
seamless education in the country. Both the positive and negative impacts of COVID
COVID-19 on education
are discussed and some fruitful suggestions are also pointed to carry out educational activities during
the pandemic
pand
situation.

Key Words:
Education, COVID-19,
Impact, Govt. of India.

INTRODUCTION
The pandemic Covid-19
19 has spread over whole world and
compelled the human society to maintain social distancing. It
has significantly disrupted the education sector which is a
critical determinant of a country’s economic future. On
February 11, 2020, the World
orld Health Organisation (WHO)
(
proposed an official name of the virus as COVID-19,
COVID
an
acronym for Coronavirus disease 2019. It was first identified in
Wuhan, China on December 31, 2019. First death by COVIDCOVID
19 was the 61-year
year old man in Wuhan, China on January 11,
2020. WHO declared COVID-19
19 as a pandemic on March 11,
2020. The first case of the COVID-19
19 pandemic in India was
reported on 30 January 2020 in the state of Kerala and the
affected had a travel history from Wuhan, China (Wikipedia).
The first death due to COVID-19
19 was reported in India on
March 12, 2020. It has affected more than 4.5 million peoples
worldwide (WHO). According to the UNESCO report, it had
affected more than 90% of total world’s student population
during mid April 2020 which is now reduced to nearly 67%
during June 2020. Outbreak of COVI-19
19 has impacted more
than 120 crores of students and youths across the planet. In
India, more than 32 crores of students have been affected by
the various restrictions and the nationwide lockdown for
COVI-19. As per the UNESCO report, about 14 crores of
primary and 13 crores of secondary students are affected which
are two mostly affected levels in India.

After observing the corona virus pandemic situation the WHO
advised to maintain social distancing as the first prevention
step. So, every country started the action of lockdown to
separate the contaminated people. The education sect
sectors
including schools, colleges and universities became closed.
Classes suspended and all examinations of schools, colleges
and universities including entrance tests were postponed
indefinitely. Thus, the
he lockdown destroyed the schedules of
every student. Though it is an exceptional situation in the
history of education, COVID
COVID-19 has created many
opportunities to come out of the rigorous classroom teaching
model to a new era of digital model.
The lockdown has compelled many educational institutions to
cancel their classes, examinations, internships etc. and to
choose the online modes. Initially, the educators and the
students were quite confused and didn’t understand how to
cope up with the situation of this sudden crisis that compelled
closure of the educational
ducational activities. But latter on all realized
that the lockdown has taught so many lessons to manage with
the emergence of such pandemics. Thus, COVID
COVID-19 has
created many challenges and opportunities for the educational
institutes to strengthen their ttechnological knowledge and
infrastructure (Pravat, 2020a). The lockdown has given them a
ray of hope for teachers and students to continue their
educational activities through online. The teachers assigned
work to students via internet, delivered lectures through live
video conferencing using different Apps like Zoom, Google
meet, Facebook, Youtube, and Skype etc. There are WhatsApp
groups of guardians, teachers, students and parents for

affective communication through which they are always in
touch to share their difficulties through this e-medium. In a
nation like China that practices a considerably more
centralization system, a change to digital learning may be
simpler. Even in a nation like the U.S.A, there are some lowpay students who don’t approach broad bands and unable to
use computerized learning arrangement (Study Abroad Life).
The same is the situation that happens with India where not
every student is well equipped with the high-speed internet and
digital gadgets and are along these lines of suffer. Numerous
advanced educational institutions in India are not also
equipped with digital facilities right now to cope up with
sudden change from traditional education set up to the online
education system.
Objectives
The present research paper focused on the following
objectives:
 To enlighten various measures taken by Govt. of India for
education sector during this pandemic.
 To highlight various positive impact of COVID-19 on
education.
 To enlist some negative impacts of COVID-19 and to put
some effective suggestions for continuing education
during the pandemic situation.

instructed the schools to hold all their classes online. The
lockdown has accelerated adoption of digital technology. It has
provided a chance to develop new and improved professional
skills/knowledge through online learning in more efficient and
productive way. Online learning is the best solution during this
pandemic Covid-19 situation (Pravat, 2020b). So, the digital
India vision of the government is emerging as a vital tool for
solving the present crisis due to Covid-19. It is a fact that
technology-based education is more transparent with all
respect. Looking at this challenge of colleges and schools
being shut, government of India, as well as state governments
and private players have undertaken proper initiatives. The
Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) has made
several arrangements, including online portals and educational
channels through Direct to Home TV, Radios for students to
continue learning. During lockdown, students are using
popular social media tools like WhatsApp, Zoom, Google
meet, Telegram, Youtube live, Facebook live etc. for online
teaching learning system. ICT initiative of MHRD (eBroucher- https://mhrd.gov.in/ict-initiatives ) is a unique
platform which combines all digital resources for online
education. The digital initiatives of MHRD for secondary as
well as higher education during COVID-19 are listed as below:

METHODOLOGY
Data and information presented in current study are collected
from various reports prepared by national and international
agencies on COVID-19 pandemic. Information are collected
from various authentic websites. Some journals and e-contents
relating to impact of COVID-19 on educational system are
referred.
Initiatives of Govt. of India on education during Covid-19
To prevent spread of pandemic COVID-19, the Government of
India has taken number of preventive measures. The union
government declared a countrywide lock-down of all
educational institutions on 16 March 2020. Central Board of
Secondary Education (CBSE) postponed all examinations of
secondary and higher secondary schools on March 18, 2020
throughout India. CBSE released revised guidelines for
examination centres to conduct examinations by maintaining a
distance of at least 1 meter between the students taking the
exam with a class not having more than 24 students. If the
rooms of the examination centres are small then the students
should be divided into different rooms accordingly. The Union
Public Service Commission (UPSC) postponed the interview
for the Civil Services Examination 2019 (Wikipedia).
Similarly the most of the state Governments and other
educational boards postponed examinations due to outbreak of
COVID-19. Govt. of India has observed one day nationwide
Janta-curfew on March 22 and implement lockdown from
March 25, 2020 onwards in different phases. Govt. of India has
been extending lockdown periods from time to time adopting
different strategies to fight with the pandemic but educational
institutions remained closed continuously. The lockdown 6.0
was declared on June 29, which is effective from 1st July to
31st July 2020 with some less restriction in other sectors except
education. Almost all state government ministries have taken
measures to ensure that the academic activities of schools and
colleges do not hamper during the lockdown period. They have

Positive impact of COVID-19 on education
Though the outbreak of COVID-19 has created many negative
impacts on education, educational institutions of India have
accepted the challenges and trying their best to provide
seamless support services to the students during the pandemic.
Indian education system got the opportunity for transformation
from traditional system to a new era. The following points may
be considered as the positive impacts.
 Move towards Blended Learning: COVID-19 has
accelerated adoption of digital technologies to deliver
education. Educational institutions moved towards
blended mode of learning. It encouraged all teachers and
students to become more technology savvy. New ways of
delivery and assessments of learning opened immense
opportunities for a major transformation in the area of
curriculum development and pedagogy. It also gives
access to large pools of learners at a time.
 Rise in use of Learning Management Systems: Use of
learning management systems by educational institutions
became a great demand. It opened a great opportunity for
the companies those have been developing and
strengthening learning management systems for use
educational institutions (Misra, 2020).
 Enhance the use of soft copy of learning material: In
lockdown situation students were not able to collect the
hard copies of study materials and hence most of the
students used of soft copies materials for reference.
 Improvement in collaborative work- There is a new
opportunity where collaborative teaching and learning
can take on new forms. Collaborations can also happen
among faculty/teachers across the world to benefit from
each other (Misra, 2020).
 Rise in online meetings- The pandemic has created a
massive rise in teleconferencing, virtual meetings,
webinars and e-conferencing opportunities
 Enhanced Digital Literacy: The pandemic situation
induced people to learn and use digital technology and
resulted in increasing the digital literacy.

 Improved the use of electronic media for sharing
information: Learning materials are shared among the
students easily and the related queries are resolved
through e-mail, SMS, phone calls and using different
social Medias like WhatsApp or Facebook.
 World wide exposure: Educators and learners are getting
opportunities to interact with peers from around the
world. Learners adapted to an international community.
 Better time management: Students are able to manage
their time more efficiently in online education during
pandemics.
 Demand for Open and Distance Learning (ODL):
During the pandemic situation most of the students
preferred ODL mode as it encourages self-learning
providing opportunities to learn from diverse resources
and customized learning as per their needs.
Negative impact of COVID-19 on education
Education sector has suffered a lot due to the outbreak of
COVID-19. It has created many negative impacts on
education and some of them are as pointed below:
 Educational activity hampered: Classes have been
suspended and exams at different levels postponed.
Different boards have already postponed the annual
examinations and entrance tests. Admission process got
delayed. Due to continuity in lockdown, student suffered
a loss of nearly 3 months of the full academic year of
2020-21 which is going to further deteriorate the
situation of continuity in education and the as students
would face much difficulty in resuming schooling again
after a huge gap.
 Impact on employment: Most of the recruitment got
postponed due to COVID-19 Placements for students
may also be affected with companies delaying the on
board of students. Unemployment rate is expected to be
increased due to this pandemic. In India, there is no
recruitment in Govt. sector and fresh graduates fear
withdrawal of their job offers from private sectors
because of the current situation. The Centre for
Monitoring
Indian
Economy’s
estimates
on
unemployment shot up from 8.4% in mid-March to 23%
in early April and the urban unemployment rate to 30.9%
(Educationasia.in). When the unemployment increases
then the education gradually decreases as people struggle
for food rather than education.
 Unprepared teachers/students for online educationNot all teachers/students are good at it or at least not all
of them were ready for this sudden transition from face to
face learning to online learning. Most of the teachers are
just conducting lectures on video platforms such as
Zoom, Google meet etc. which may not be real online
learning without any dedicated online learning platform.
 Reduced global employment opportunity- Some may
lose their jobs from other countries and the pass out
students may not get their job outside India due to
restrictions caused by COVID-19. Many Indians might
have returned home after losing their jobs overseas due
to COVID-19. Hence, the fresh students who are likely
to enter the job market shortly may face difficulty in
getting suitable employment. Many students who have
already got jobs through campus interviews may not be
able to join their jobs due to lockdown. The Indians who
have been doing their jobs abroad may lose their jobs.
Recent graduates in India are of also fearing for

withdrawal of job offers from corporate sectors because
of movement restriction in the current pandemic situation
Increased responsibility of parents to educate their
wards: Some educated parents are able to guide but
some may not have the adequate level of education
needed to teach children in the house.
Loss of nutrition due to school closure: Mid day meals
is a school meal programme of the Government of
India which
is
designed
to
provide
better
the nutritional food to school-age children nationwide.
The closure of schools has serious implications on the
daily nutrition of students as the mid-day meal schemes
have temporarily been shut. Various studies have
pointed out that mid-day meals are also an important
contributing factor for increased enrolment in the
schools
Access to digital world: As many students have limited
or no internet access and many students may not be able
to afford computer, laptop or supporting mobile phones
in their homes, online teaching-learning may create a
digital divide among students. The lockdown has hit the
poor students very hard in India as most of them are
unable to explore online learning according to various
reports. Thus the online teaching-learning method
during pandemic COVID-19 may enhance the gap
between rich/poor and urban/rural.
Access to global education: The pandemic has
significantly disrupted the higher education sector. A
large number of Indian students who are enrolled in many
Universities abroad, especially in worst affected countries
are now leaving those countries and if the situation
persists, in the long run, a there will be a significant
decline in the demand for international higher education.
Payment of Schools, Colleges fee got delayed: During
this lockdown most of the parents will be facing
the unemployment situation so they may not be able to
pay the fee for that particular time periods which may
affect the private institutes.

Suggestions

 India should develop creative strategies to ensure that all

children must have sustainable access to learning during
pandemic COVID-19. The Indian policies must include
various individuals from diverse backgrounds including
remote regions, marginalised and minority groups for
effective delivery.
Immediate measures are required to lessen the effects of
the pandemic on job offers, internship programs, and
research projects.
Many online learning platforms offer multiple
programmes on the same subjects with different levels of
certifications, methodology and assessment parameters.
So, the quality of programmes may differ across different
online learning platforms. Therefore, establishment of
quality assurance mechanisms and quality benchmark for
online learning programmes must be developed and
offered by Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in India
keeping in view of rapid growth of the online learning
platforms
Across the globe, Indian traditional knowledge is well
known for its scientific innovations, values and benefits
to develop sustainable technologies and medicines and
this knowledge systems in different fields should be

integrated with a present-day mainstream higher
education system.
Govt and educational institutes should plan to continue
the educational activities maintaining social distancing.
30-40%
students
and
teachers
may
attend
schools/colleges in two shifts per day to carry on
educational activities by obeying guidelines for
COVID-19.
At current times, access to technology and internet is an
urgent requirement. So, the digital capabilities and the
required infrastructure must reach to the remotest and
poorest communities to facilitate the students to continue
their education during the pandemics. There is a need to
deploy public funds to fix the internet gap and ensure
that students continue to learn digitally. The state
governments/private organisations should come up with
ideas to address this issue of digital education.
Some significant issues associated with distance learning
strategies like the availability and access to digital
devices with internet connectivity, the need for safe
learning spaces, creating capabilities for teachers,
families and students to operate and navigate digital
devices, and engaging lesson plans for disabled students
and other marginalised groups should be addressed by
Govt. and the stakeholders.

Conclusion
COVID-19 has impacted immensely to the education sector of
India. Though it has created many challenges, various
opportunities are also evolved. The Indian Govt. and different
stakeholders of education have explored the possibility of
Open and Distance learning (ODL) by adopting different
digital technologies to cope up with the present crisis of
COVID-19. India is not fully equipped to make education
reach all corners of the nation via digital platforms. The
students who aren’t privileged like the others will suffer due to
the present choice of digital platforms. But universities and the
government of India are relentlessly trying to come up with a
solution to resolve this problem. The priority should be to
utilise digital technology to create an advantageous position for
millions of young students in India. It is need of the hour for
the educational institutions to strengthen their knowledge and
Information Technology infrastructure to be ready for facing
COVID-19 like situations.
Even if the COVID-19 crisis stretches longer, there is an
urgent need to take efforts on maximum utilisation of online
platforms so that students not only complete their degree in
this academic year but also to get ready for the future digital
oriented environment. The concept of “work from home” has
greater relevance in such pandemic situation to reduce spread
of COVID-19. India should develop creative strategies to
ensure that all children must have sustainable access to
learning during pandemic COVID-19. The Indian policies
must include various individuals from diverse backgrounds
including remote regions, marginalised and minority groups
for effective delivery of education. As online practice is
benefitting the students immensely, it should be continued
after the lockdown. Further detailed statistical study may be
undertaken to explore the impact of COVID-19 on education
system of India.
