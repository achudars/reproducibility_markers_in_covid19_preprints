Abstract
A fractional compartmental mathematical model for the spread of the COVID-19 disease is proposed. Special focus has been done on the transmissibility of super-spreaders individuals. Numerical simulations are shown for data of Galicia, Spain, and Portugal. For each region, the order of
the Caputo derivative takes a different value, that is not close to one, showing the relevance of
considering fractional models.
Key words: mathematical modeling of COVID-19 pandemic, Galicia, Spain and Portugal case
studies, fractional differential equations, numerical simulations.

1. Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the outbreak due to severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has taken on pandemic proportions in 2020, affecting several millions
of individuals in almost all countries [12]. An integrated science and multidisciplinary approach is
necessary to fight the COVID-19 pandemic [17, 18]. In particular, mathematical and epidemiological simulation plays a crucial role in predicting, anticipating, and controlling present and future
epidemics.
As for the mathematical modelling of coronavirus disease COVID-19, it has been shown to be
extremely useful for governments in order to define appropriate policies [19]. In this direction, a
number of papers has been recently published related with modelling of this pandemic (see, e.g.,
[6, 9], just to cite some of them).
In [19], a model including the super-spreader class has been presented, and applied to give
an estimation of the infected and death individuals in Wuhan. The collaboration with Galician
government [3] has allowed to understand some important considerations in order to perform
analysis. In particular, due to the pandemic, some cases have not been reported as expected, but
with some days of delay. As a consequence, in this paper we propose to consider not the daily
reported cases, but the means in the previous 5 days of daily reported cases. As a result, it seems
appropriate to consider fractional derivatives, which have been intensively used to obtain models
of infectious diseases since they take into account the memory effect, which is now bigger due to
the aforementioned mean of the five previous days of daily reported cases. Having estimates a
priori of infected individuals of COVID-19, obtained by using mathematical models, has helped
to predict the number of required beds both for hospitalized individuals and mainly at intensive
care units [3].

Fractional calculus and fractional differential equations have recently been applied in numerous
areas of mathematics, physics, engineering, bio-engineering, and other applied sciences. We refer
the reader to the monographs [7, 11, 13, 22, 24, 25, 27] and the articles [1, 2, 20, 26]. In this work
we shall consider the Caputo fractional derivative [4] (see also [8]). A fractional model using the
Caputo–Fabrizio fractional derivative of COVID-19 in Wuhan (China) has been developed in [21].
The structure of this work is as follows. In Section 2, we introduce a fractional model by using
Caputo fractional derivatives on the classical compartmental model presented in [19], and where
the fractional order of differentiation α can be used to describe different strains and genomes of the
coronavirus and vary with mutations. In Section 3, some numerical results are presented for three
different territories: Galicia, Spain, and Portugal. Galicia is an autonomous community of Spain
and located in the northwest Iberian Peninsula and having a population of about 2,700,000 and
a total area of 29,574 km2. Spain (officially, the Kingdom of Spain) is a country mostly located
on the Iberian Peninsula, in southwestern Europe, with a population of about 47,000,000 people
and a total area of 505,992 km2. Portugal (officially, the Portuguese Republic) is also a country
located mostly on the Iberian Peninsula with a population of about 10,276,000 individuals and a
total area of 92,212 km2. We end with Section 4 of conclusions and discussion.
2. The Proposed COVID-19 Fractional Model
In what follows we shall assume that we have a constant population divided in 8 epidemiological
classes, namely:
1.

susceptible individuals (S),
exposed individuals (E),
symptomatic and infectious individuals (I),
super-spreaders individuals (P ),
infectious but asymptomatic individuals (A),
hospitalized individuals (H),
recovery individuals (R), and
dead individuals (F ) or fatality class.

Our model is based on the one presented in [19] and substituting the first order derivative by
a derivative of fractional order α. We use the fractional derivative in the sense of Caputo: for an
absolutely continuous function f : [0, ∞) → R the Caputo fractional derivative of order α > 0 is
given by [11, 13, 15, 22]:
Z t

(t − s)−α f ′ (s)ds.
D f (t) =
Γ(1 − α) 0
Fractional calculus and fractional differential equations are an active area of research and, in
some cases, adequate to incorporate the history of the processes [1, 10, 14, 15, 16, 23, 27]. The

ρ2 is a relative very low rate at which exposed individuals become super-spreaders,
1 − ρ1 − ρ2 is the progression from exposed to asymptomatic class,
γa is the average rate at which symptomatic and super-spreaders individuals become hospitalized,
γi is the recovery rate without being hospitalized,
γr is the recovery rate of hospitalized patients,
δi denotes the disease induced death rates due to infected individuals,
δp denotes the disease induced death rates due to super-spreaders individuals,

A flowchart of model (1) is presented in Figure 2. For additional details and particular values of
the parameters we refer the reader to [19].

3. Numerical Simulations
Next, we shall show the numerical simulations in three territories: Galicia, Portugal, and
Spain. For all these cases we have considered the official data published by the corresponding
authorities and we have computed the means of the five previous reports. As it has been observed
during this pandemic, the output of the laboratories has had some delays due to the big pressure
and collapse of the public health systems. In this way, some cases have been reported with
some delay and some updates have been published days later of the corresponding dates. In
order to reduce these problems, we consider the mean of the five previous reported cases, always
following the official data. Moreover, in each of the territories there are specificities such as
territorial dispersion/concentration, use of public transportation, and mainly the date of starting
the confinement, as compared with the initial spread of the COVID-19. These factors imply tiny
adjustments in the factor to divide the total population as well as in the value of the fractional
parameter α. For solving the system of fractional differential equations (1) we have used [5], by
using Matlab in a MacBook Pro computer with a 2.3 GHz Intel Core i9 processor and 16GB of
2400 MHz DDR4 memory.

Table 1: Data of the autonomous region of Galicia. The list of 51 days includes the cumulative, new infected and
mean of the previous 5 days.

The data includes 51 values starting 7th March since after that date (27th April) the way of
officially computing individuals has changed.
By considering the fractional order α = 0.85 and the same values of the parameters as in [19],
the results of the numerical simulation are shown in Figure 3.1. The green line denotes the real data
while the black line is the numerical solution of the fractional system (1), with total population
N = 2, 700, 000/500, where N = S + E + I + P + A + H + R + F , since the population of Galicia
is widely dispersed in the territory with very few big cities and low use of public transportation.
3.2. The Case Study of Spain
As for the Kingdom of Spain, the data of 82 days is collected in Table 3.2, as for the cumulative
cases, the new daily infected individuals, as well as the mean of the 5 previous days, starting 25th
February.
By considering again the fractional order α = 0.85 and the same values of the parameters as
in [19], the results of the numerical simulation are shown in Figure 3.2. The green line denotes
the real data while the black line is the numerical solution of the fractional system (1), with
N = 47, 000, 000/425 since in some parts of Spain there is more concentrated population and
intensive use of public transportation.

3.3. The Case Study of Portugal
As for the Republic of Portugal, the data of 56 days starting 3rd March for the cumulative
cases, the new daily infected individuals, as well as the mean of the 5 previous days is collected in
Table 3.3.
By considering now the fractional order α = 0.75 and the same values of the parameters as in
[19], the results of the numerical simulation are shown in Figure 3.3. As in the previous figures,
the green line denotes the real data while the black line is the numerical solution of the fractional
system (1), with N = 10, 280, 000/1750 since the Portuguese population is widely dispersed and
the confinement started at an earlier stage of the spread of the disease.
4. Conclusions and Discussion
In this paper, we have shown the importance of considering a fractional Caputo differential
system, where the order of the derivative α plays a crucial role to fit the number of confirmed
cases in the regions of Galicia, Spain and Portugal. In fact, the considered values of α = 0.85 for
Galicia and Spain and α = 0.75 for Portugal, are not close to 1 (the classical derivative), as it

the same values of the parameters in the differential system (1), taken from [19], were used for
the three regions. Therefore, we may conclude that model (1) can be used to approximate the
confirmed cases of COVID-19 in regions with different economic, geographical, social and epidemic
characteristics, as it happens for the three considered regions in this paper.

Our variables are divided into eight epidemiological sub-populations as in [19] and they are
detailed at the beginning of the second section, dedicated to the introduction of the dynamical
model. We have solved our fractional dynamical model using a subroutine called FracPECE [5] to
approximate numerically the solution of the proposed fractional system of differential equations.
Our numerical simulations show a good agreement between the output of the fractional model
given by the sum of the symptomatic and infectious individuals, super-spreaders, and hospitalized
individuals and the data collected from the health authorities in Spain, Portugal and Galicia. We
plan to consider other countries and regions in our future studies and also, of course, an update
of the data. In the future, we also plan to study the stability of the possible equilibrium point,
the bifurcation of solutions depending on the parameters, and the role of the basic reproduction
number.
Our fractional model is novel and in the future we will study the optimal fractional order of
differentiation for the study of the COVID-19 epidemic in different contexts. The system has a
unique solution for given initial conditions and a detailed mathematical analysis study will be
performed. A crucial point is, of course, to determine the optimal fractional order α adequate for
each process and, in this case, each region.
The results obtained here allow us to conjecture that the strains and genomes of the new
coronavirus present in Spain and Portugal are different than those that initially hit China: the
proposed mathematical model is good to describe the outbreak that was first identified in Wuhan
in December 2019 with α = 1; to describe the spread in Spain and its autonomous community of
Galicia, where the virus was first confirmed on January 31 and March 4 2020, respectively, with
α = 0.85; and the COVID-19 situation in Portugal with α = 0.75, where the first cases of COVID19 were recorded in March 2, 2020. We will continue our research using this and other future
models, as well as considering different approaches as the COVID-19 evolves and new insights and
conjectures emerge.
