1. Introduction

ccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the
COVID-19 pandemic could cost the world economy up
to $9 Trillion USD, nearly the combined gross domestic product (GDP) of Japan and Germany, or roughly half that of
the US.∗ Since the first official case was confirmed in Wuhan,
China, more than 16 million individuals have been infected
at the time of writing, leading to over 650 thousand deaths.†
Compared to such diseases as the 2003 SARS-CoV, the H1N1
influenza A, and the Ebola virus, COVID-19 shows strong
infectiousness, with a reproductive number, R0 > 3, according to some studies (1). In the absence of a widely-available
treatment or vaccines, social distancing is thought to be an
effective strategy to protect from the virus (2, 3). Prolonged
social distancing has other side-effects, both socially and economically (4, 5), leading to pressure to relax stricter policies.
It is important to reach a finer-grained understanding of available crisis management options that minimize side-effects of
re-opening.
We develop algorithms that model the impact of different
venue-centric partial re-opening policies on the future spread
of COVID-19. By venue-centric, we refer to policies that manipulate availability, occupancy, opening hours, or admission

conditions in a venue-dependent manner. This granularity
of policy definition allows expression of finer-grained policies,
such as ones that manipulate occupancy of specific types of
venues; for example, re-open the retail sector but not schools,
or limit restaurant occupancy to a given fraction of capacity. Given data collected under some policies, the algorithm
predicts the impact of other potential policies to implement
next. The goal is to answer the question of “return to normal”.
What steps are safe to take towards restoration of elements
of normalcy? How to customize the answers to the special
circumstances of different regional populations?
The work borrows insights from information cascade propagation on social networks (6). Information (similarly to viral
contagion) propagates through broadcast channels. In the information space, a broadcast channel might be a Facebook wall,
online subreddit, or virtual “hangout”. These virtual spaces
create opportunities for information transmission among individuals who frequent them. In the world of viral contagion,
physical spaces, such as stores, offices, public transport, and
family residences, constitute social interaction venues that
serve the role of broadcast channels. It is useful to think of
categories of such spaces, such as schools, workplaces, and
brick-and-mortar retail shops. We call these categories, social
mixing domains. Venue-centric social distancing policies manipulate the availability, hours, and entry conditions of some
of these domains. Information cascade models predict what

Recent re-opening policies in the US, following a period of social distancing measures, introduced a significant increase in daily COVID19 infections, calling for a roll-back or substantial revisiting of these
policies in many states. The situation is suggestive of difficulties
modeling the impact of partial distancing/re-opening policies on future epidemic spread for purposes of choosing safe alternatives.
More specifically, one needs to understand the impact of manipulating the availability of social interaction venues (e.g., schools, workplaces, and retail establishments) on virus spread. We introduce a
model, inspired by social networks research, that answers the above
question. Our model compartmentalizes interaction venues into categories we call mixing domains, enabling one to predict COVID19 contagion trends in different geographic regions under different
“what if” assumptions on partial re-opening of individual domains.
We apply our model to several highly impacted states showing (i)
how accurately it predicts the extent of current resurgence (from
available policy descriptions), and (ii) what alternatives might be
more effective at mitigating the second wave. We further compare
policies that rely on partial venue closure to policies that espouse
wide-spread periodic testing instead (i.e., in lieu of social distancing). Our models predict that the benefits of (mandatory) testing outshadow the benefits of partial venue closure, suggesting that perhaps more efforts should be directed to such a mitigation strategy.

Significance Statement
The work predicts the impact of a wide range of social distancing and reopening policies on COVID-19 propagation outcomes in different communities. Candidate policies manipulate
the availability of specific social mixing domains, such as closure/resumption of business for some part of the workforce,
changes in business opening hours and/or in maximum allowable occupancy, closure/resumption of schools, cancellation of
events above a specified size, and/or imposing testing requirements as a precondition of entry into various establishments.
The produced estimates allow making informed policy choices
in the face of pressure to relax distancing restrictions at a time
when no effective treatment or vaccine are widely available.
Initial exploration of the space of partial re-opening policies
suggests that mandatory testing may be a more effective strategy than social distancing.

effects of a wide playbook of social distancing and reopening
options on contagion dynamics.

2. Venue-based Propagation Decomposition
The main contribution of this work is a model and its application (to COVID-19) that decomposes the equivalent overall
virus transmissibility as a weighted sum over social interaction
venues in order to understand the contribution of different
interaction venues to the overall transmission dynamics and
enable exploration of a space of partial closure/re-opening policies that manipulate availability of social interaction venues
to minimize spread. The results stem from the propagation
decomposition theorem, derived by the authors and stated
below, allowing one to investigate the impact of venue-based
COVID-19 mitigation strategies. The proof of the theorem is
shown in Appendix A.

The above result is derived by analyzing the interactions between the susceptible and the infected individuals. It is valid
for epidemiological models that include the susceptible and
infected states, such as the SIS, SIR, and SEIR models, as
well as their extensions. Its proof is described in Appendix A.
Table 1 defines the used terminology.

3. Applying the Venue-based Decomposition Model
To apply Equation (1), we divide the population into G different groups and divide all social interaction venues into C
different categories, we call mixing domains. The model does
not dictate how to break up the population and interaction
venues into categories. This freedom can be exploited to
construct progressively more nuanced policies that include a
larger number of groups and domains. For now, we group
social interaction venues into C = 4 categories (or mixing
domains), namely: home, work, school, and commercial. In
general, the mixing domains should match those that a policy might wish to individually manipulate. For example, if
the policy will make explicit decisions on opening/closure of
venues of worship, then worship should be cast as an explicit
mixing domain. Similarly, we categorize the population into

The Propagation Decomposition Theorem: Consider a geographic region where the total population comprises, for analysis purposes, a set G of nonoverlapping groups (e.g., employed and unemployed,
or minors, adults, and seniors). Individuals split their
time among n social interaction venues, such that individuals in group gj ∈ G spend, on average, a fraction,
ηij of their time in venue i (some fractions could be
zero). Let αi be the nominal occupancy of venue i, normalized to population size. We shall henceforth call it,
venue size. Let fij be the average fraction of occupancy
of venue i who are from group gj , and Let τi be the
probability that an infected person in venue i infects
another in the same venue (i.e., venue-specific transmissibility). Then, the equivalent overall transmissibility
of the virus in the community is:

In Equation (2), k enumerates the four possible mixing domains: home, work, school, and commercial; i enumerates the
specific social interaction venues included in each mixing domain; and j is the age group indicator: pre-school, child/teen,
adult, and senior. Additionally, τi denotes transmissiblity
within the i-th specific venue; αi denotes the average occupancy of the i-th venue; fkj denotes the fraction of individuals
in domain k who are of group j; and ηkj denotes the fraction
of time that members of group j spend in domain k.
A. The Transmissibility Approximation. We assume that in a

particular venue, the transmissibility is proportional to the
venue size raised to power −M . In other words:
τi ≈ καi−M

[3]

where M > 0 and κ is a proportionality constant. Smaller
venues (e.g., a family residence) typically feature closer interactions than larger ones. Thus, while in a larger venue, the
expected number of individuals that a person might infect is
larger, the single person-to-person transmission probability
may be higher in a smaller venue. Accordingly, substituting
from Equation (3) into Equation (2), we get the following
approximation:

The parameter, M , and the proportionality constant, κ, can

Section D. Next, we describe another key approximation.

[5]

The limits upperk and lowerk are the largest and smallest
venue size (referring to nominal occupancy of the venue) within
domain k. Substituting with pk (x) = ak x−bk in the above two
equations, ak and bk can be found, thus completely specifying
the distribution of venue sizes in the domain. Equation (4)

C. Policy Specification. From Equation (6), to compute the
impact of a new policy, P, on overall virus transmissibility, one
needs to estimate the values of the product fkj ηkj (for each social group j and mixing domain k) under the new policy, as well
as the distribution pk (x) (given by parameters ak , bk , lowerk
and upperk , described above). Let us denote these policy(P) (P)
specific parameters by the tuple v (P) = hfkj ηkj , pk (x)(P) i.
(P) (P)

Note that, the product fkj ηkj is the fraction of person-hours
spent in domain k by members of group j. Substituting with
these parameters in Equation (6), one gets the corresponding
(P)
transmissibility τeq . We are now ready for outcome prediction, described below.
D. Outcome Prediction. To compute M and κ one needs to fit

past known infection incidence data (in order to empirically
measure transmissibility) under two different previously implemented policies, say P1 and P2 , producing two instances of
Equation (6), one for each past policy. Since the parameters,
v (P1 ) and v (P2 ) are known for previously implemented policies,
the only unknowns are κ and M that can then be determined.
We call these two previously implemented policies, calibration

• Step 1: Fit an epidemiological model to observational
infection incidence data observed under (at least) two
different policies, P1 and P2 , in order to empirically de(P )
(P )
termine τeq 1 for the first policy and τeq 2 for the second
policy (from curve-fitting). Let the empirically found
(P )
(P )
ratio τeq 1 /τeq 2 be denoted by c.
• Step 2: Use demographic data to compute the parameter
sets: v (P1 ) and v (P2 ) for these previous policies.
• Step 3: Estimate M from the empirically found ratio of
(P )
(P )
values of transmissibility: τeq 1 /τeq 2 = c. Specifically,
substitute on the right-hand-size from Equation (6) (with
the corresponding values of v (P1 ) and v (P2 ) ) to replace
(P )
(P )
τeq 1 and τeq 2 , respectively. The only unknown in the
resulting equation should be M , which can thus be determined. As mentioned above, one can think of policies P1
and P2 as calibration policies.

carry out the last summation, since it ranges over all individual
interaction venues in mixing domain, k. In practice, it is not
always possible (or at least very cumbersome) to determine the
size of all the individual venues in a given mixing domain (e.g.,
all residences within the home domain). However, we usually
know the mean, M eank . Thus, we can use a distribution.
Let the venue sizes in domain k be given by the distribution,
pk (x), over the size variable, x. In this paper, we assume that
venue sizes are given by a power-law (i.e., Zipf) distribution.
This distribution is commonly found in nature to describe
popularity, a concept that is quite related to occupancy. Thus,
consider the distribution pk (x) = ak x−bk , where lowerk ≤
x ≤ upperk , and pk (x) = 0 elsewhere. We then have:

policies. To predict outcomes of a new policy, P3 , one can
now substitute the previously computed, M and κ, together
with the policy description, v (P3 ) , in Equation (6) to compute
the corresponding new transmissibility. In most regions in
the US, the above approach is feasible because several policies
have already been attempted. For example, most regions were
initially under a no-distancing policy (i.e., P1 = absence of a
distancing policy), then they were under a strict distancing
policy, say, P2 . The question they are grappling with is the
re-opening policy, say, P3 . Thus, prediction is done as follows:

• Step 4: For a new policy, P3 , whose effect is to be
(P )
predicted, calculate the transmissibility τeq 3 using the
(P3 )
estimated M and parameters v
. As before, to avoid κ,
(P )
(P )
compute a ratio such as τeq 3 /τeq 2 from Equation (6),
(P )
then use the empirically found τeq 2 (and the computed
(P3 )
ratio) to determine τeq .
(P )

• Step 5: The value of τeq 3 can then be used in an epidemiological model to predict the future infection incidence
time series. In the rest of this work, we shall use a modified SIR that features a decaying function f (t) to emulate
gradual transition among policies (see Appendix B for
details) to ensure the smoothness:

= τeq
· f (t) · S(t)I(t) − γ · I(t),

[7]

[9]

where S(t), I(t), and R(t) denote the numbers of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals at time t, whereas
γ denotes the recovery rate.

4. An Illustrative Example of COVID-19 Predictions
(P)

Next, we offer an example of quantifying τeq for a specific
state in the US with policy, P. For the initial calibration
policies, we use the “no-distancing” policy (i.e., the initial
situation before any distancing policies went into effect) and
the first distancing policy that was implemented (which we
call “strict distancing”). To illustrate, we pick California (CA)
and Georgia (GA). Other states follow a similar process.

A. Demographic and Domain Data Collection. To populate

the vector, v , for policy, P, the following data is required
(per state): (i) population distribution by age group; (ii) daily
distribution of time across mixing domains, per age group;
(iii) distribution of venue sizes within each mixing domain
category.

A.2. (ii) Time Distribution. For each age group, the daily time

structure could be found in US Bureau of Labor Statistics§ . In
this data source, the time structure is allocated by “primary
activities”. In our experiment, we group these “primary activities” by their locations, roughly corresponding to our four
major categories: home, work, school, and commercial. The
statistics before social distancing (i.e., for P = “no distancing”)
are shown in Table 3.

A.3. (iii) Initial Social Distancing Policy in CA and GA. The first so-

cial distancing policy (P = “strict distancing”) changed the
population’s time distribution profile. Schools were fully closed.
Non-essential workers were ordered to stay home. This reduced the total number of individuals who report to work by
80% for Georgia, and 50% for California. The commercial sector activity decreased by 50% and 80% (according to Google
Mobility reports¶ ) for CA and GA, respectively. Therefore,
using these percentages, the new average time structure for
each age group is shown in Table 4.
A.4. (iv) Distribution of Mixing Domains. As stated above, inter-

action venues have been divided into four main categories.
Within each category, we assume that venue sizes follow the
Zipf’s distribution. This distribution is widely applied to
popularity-related statistics in physical and social sciences,
such as word usage counts in natural language (7), and sizes

B. Prediction. We continue our illustrative example, consider

the following re-opening policy action categories whose impact
we might want to predict:
• Policy A: Reopen 50% classes in schools.

• Policy B: Reopen small classes in schools with maximum
allowable capacity as 50.
• Policy C: Reopen 75% offices in workplaces.
• Policy D: Reopen small offices in workplaces with maximum allowable capacity as 50.
• Policy E: Reopen all commercial retail with maximum
75% opening time.
• Policy F: Reopen all commercial retail with maximum
allowable occupancy as 50.

Table 6 shows the predictions for each virtual policy. While
these results are actual values computed using our model,
the purpose of this section remains to offer an illustrative
example. Model validation is presented in the next section.
A quantitative way to evaluate the safety of each policy is to
compute the basic reproductive number R0 of the virus under
the given policy. Note that:
R0 =

β
τeq · N
=
γ
γ

[10]

where β is the effective contact rate with infected individuals,
N is the total population, and γ is the recovery rate. Generally
speaking, policies with R0 < 1 are safe, while those with R0 > 1
are likely to stimulate large contagions.
Among the example policies considered in our illustration,
we find that the situation for California is worse. The values of
R0 for all considered policies are larger than 1. As for Georgia,
apart from reopening schools, other policies we consider in our

5. Model Validation Experiments
For validation, we evaluate our model on four geographically
and demographically diverse states in the US: California,
Florida, New York and Texas. Readers may also refer to
our public website‡‡ for up-to-date predictions for these and
other states.
To train our model, we need two calibration policies for
each state, as described earlier. The first one we use is the “no
distancing” policy that reflects the conditions before distancing
was implemented. We start monitoring when the number of
confirmed cases exceeds 10 and end when the first distancing
policy is implemented. The second policy used for calibration is
the initial “strict distancing” policy. It starts when distancing
is first implemented and ends when re-opening starts. We
then predict the effects of the reopening policy. Figure 1
‡‡

https://covid19predictions.csl.illinois.edu/

Yang et al.

shows the prediction results, compared to ground truth. The
pessimistic/optimistic prediction curves shown in the figure
are generated by changing the predicted τeq up/down by 2%.
For each state, we show the date when the re-opening
policy was implemented. Note that, we train the model using
data collected before that date only (the training period).
We then use the methodology presented earlier to compute
a new model for the re-opening policy. We use that model
to predict the impact of re-opening. Table 7 summarizes the
re-opening policies for the four states. Prediction results are
shown through the end of June. We do not show July because
many states changed their reopening policies again in July.
For clarity. we restrict the predictions to the duration of one
policy only.
The results shown in Figure 1 indicate that our model provides a realistic and accurate prediction. The predicted trend
can differ from the one during model training. For example,
in Florida, one may notice that the cumulative cases before
reopening (i.e., in the training period) have started to saturate.
However, the prediction model for the re-opening phases correctly estimates that the number of cases will escalate again.
Ground truth shown for that period confirms the prediction.

California, Florida, and Texas exceed the safe threshold, which
is consistent with the situation that they have experienced a

6. Re-opening Policies and Predicted Outcomes
Next, we compare predicted efficacy of venue-based and testingbased policies for two example states, California and Georgia.
We estimate the basic reproductive number R0 and the number
of cumulative cases after one month as two evaluation metrics.
Readers can refer to Section 3 for the used venue-based policies.
The predicted curves for venue-based and testing-based policies
are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively. In testingbased policies, it is assumed that individuals are required to
get tested periodically and that individuals found positive
are quarantined. We vary the testing period from 7 days to
35. For the testing-based policies, we assume that no social
distancing is used. To model this baseline, we modify a basic
SIR model to feature a quarantined state. Let L denote the
required testing period. Thus, of those infected (I), the number
of tested per day will be (1/L) · I, on average. They will be
quarantined. The resulting model becomes:

The comparison shows that weekly testing offers better
results than all compared venue-based policies. While it is
difficult to build sufficient capacity for such frequent testing,
this observation suggests that investments in cheap and widely
available tests may be warranted.

7. Related Work
The work is new in developing a mesoscopic epidemiological
model in which the fundamental abstraction is neither the
individual agent (node) nor an entire community, but rather
an element in between: a single broadcast channel or mixing
domain. Often popularity or size distribution of human and
social artifacts follows standard profiles, such as Zipf Law (9),
resulting in the same striking statistical distribution regularity
in fields as diverse as linguistics (10, 11), urban populations (12,
13), business income distributions (14), and the Internet (15).
Recent executive orders in the US, in effect, manipulate the
distribution of sizes of available social interaction venues by
closing or reopening some mixing domains. Our mesoscopic
model allows us to link social distancing policy decisions to the
distribution of mixing domains, which in turn allows estimating

future viral spread. The work aims to inform decision-making
on crisis mitigation policies.
Mesoscopic models are a middle ground between two wellpopulated extremes in current literature; namely, agent-centric
models and population-centric models (representing microscopic and macroscopic models, respectively). A recent survey
discusses these existing models and the corresponding cascade
mitigation policies they allow (16). On one hand, agent-centric
models (17–20) start with the behavior of individual agents,
as well as their connectivity graphs. They enable reasoning
about fine-grained mitigation strategies, such as inoculation of
specific agents to reduce disease spread. Agent-based models
can also be used for detailed simulations to understand the
impact of a large variety of detailed interventions. While very
powerful and versatile, they require inputs that are difficult
to collect, such as the interaction graph of all agents in the
system. This limitation often renders them less suitable in
practice.
On the other hand, population-centric models, such as
SIR (21), SEIR (22), SIS (23), and SQIS (24), focus on the
total population. They reason about statistics of entire communities, such as the total number of infected, susceptible,
and recovered individuals. They can also model high-level
mitigation strategies such as inoculation of a specified fraction
of the entire community (i.e., their removal from the susceptible list). These models, however, do not offer a clear way
of reasoning about impacts of finer grained decisions, such
as closure of some fraction of businesses or meeting venues.
Macroscopic methods for COVID-19 trend prediction (25–31)
thus lack the ability to forecast effects of different policies.
To enable a more detailed analysis of epidemics, researchers
extended the population-centric models by dividing the whole
population into several groups, to form a finer-grained basis
for analysis (32). Heterogeneous mixing approaches (33–36)
split individuals by their contact degrees. For a given degree,
they use three differential equations to describe the evolution
of three states. Age-structured epidemiological models (37–39)
assume different properties of people in different age groups.
The epidemics are then governed by several sets of differential
equations and some mixing policies. Some extensions (40)
consider the state of each individual and study the state
evolution during the infection process.
Unlike the above solutions that are based on partitioning of
individuals or communities (by some demographic, geographic,
of interaction-based pattern), we borrow inspiration from social
media to focus on social mixing domains instead. Interactions
need venues to facilitate them. The interaction patterns are
thus a function of social mixing domains (i.e., the venues)
that remain available. The advantage of our approach lies
in its venue-centric model, as opposed to the more common
community-centric or agent-centric models.

8. Conclusion
The paper introduced a methodology for evaluating COVID-19
mitigation policies that reply on manipulation of available social mixing domains. The model relates virus transmissibility
to the availability of social interaction venues, manipulated
by social distancing policies. The results show that the simplified model is capable of accurately predicting changes in the
contagion time series, allowing decision-makers to experiment
with various distancing policies. For comparison, results of

Let the number of susceptible individuals in a community be
denote by S(t) and the number of infected individuals by I(t).
Let N denote the total population, and β the effective rate
of spread. Now assume that the region consists of n social
interaction venues. An individual divides their time among
several venues (e.g., home, office, and other outlets). We call
individuals who visit venue, Di , patrons of Di . Let Ni = |Di |
be the nominal occupancy of Di , which we call its size. Let ηi
be the average time a patron spends in Di .
Let us further denote the rate of transmission from one
infected individual (to all susceptible individuals) per unit time
(say one day) in venue Di by βi . Let the expected number of
susceptible and infected individuals in the i-th venue, at time t,
be denoted by Si (t) and Ii (t), respectively. Furthermore, let us
define ζi (t) = Si (t)/S(t) and κi (t) = Ii (t)/I(t). The fractions,
ζi (t) and κi (t) are, respectively, the expected fraction of all
those susceptible and the expected fraction of all those infected,
who are patrons of venue Di . Assuming an SIR model, we can
thus write:

Adding up over all venues, we get:

The above equations roughly assume that each infected individual in Di makes, say, ci encounters in the venue per
unit time, of which, therefore, ci Si (t)/Ni are in susceptible
population (Si (t)/Ni is the probability of the susceptible in
Di ) . If the probability of transmission per encounter is τi ,
then each infected individual passes the virus to τi ci Si (t)/Ni
others, leading to the above equations, where βi = τi ci . In
our analysis, we assume that the number of other encountered
individuals in a grows with the size of the venue (e.g., one
passes more people in a conference than in a small party).
Thus, ci grows proportionally to Ni , whereas τi (which can be
redefined to absorb the proportionality constant) is generally
higher for smaller venues, since people tend to have closer
(and/or longer) encounters in smaller groups. Thus, we can
rewrite βi as:
βi = τi Ni

Perfect Mixing Approximation.
Let us briefly discuss the implications of the above equations. In a system, where everyone is restricted to venues that are perfectly quarantined (for example, restricted to their family residences under strict quarantine), the ratio of infected in the quarantine zone, κi = Ii (t)/I(t), will be disproportionately higher
than what venue size might predict this ratio to be (i.e.,
Ii (t)/I(t) > Ni /N ). Similarly, the same ratio outside the
quarantine zone will be lower. In our analysis, however, we
assume that strict quarantine is no longer socially viable. Instead, individuals from different venues will mix (in other
venues). For example, individuals from different households
might mix in the same grocery store or office and individuals
from different offices might mix at the same bus stop. (Of
course, the opportunities for mixing are constrained by available venues.) We assume that mixing fails to localize infections
in any subset of venues, and instead spreads the infection as
broadly as possible. The above mixing assumption leads to
an important worst-case approximation. Namely, if mixing
is perfect, the expected number of susceptible (infected) individuals in a venues is roughly proportional to its size. More
specifically:

Ni
S(t)
N
Ni
Ii (t) ≈
I(t)
N

Si (t) ≈

[25]
[26]

We consider this a worst-case approximation because the
resulting analysis tends to maximize estimates of total spread.
If mixing is imperfect, then virus spread will slow down sooner
in more heavily impacted venues (due to scarcity of remaining
susceptible individuals), while it will also proceed at a slower
rate in others (due to scarcity of infected individuals). The
worst-case assumption is helpful from the perspective of erring
on the safe side. Let us define αi to be the fraction αi = Ni /N .
From the above, we get:

In our model, the parameters τeq and γ can be estimated

a mitigation policy is implemented). After the first change

ηi and ηi0 represent the average fraction of time an individual
spends in venue Di , before and after a mitigation policy is
implemented.

Observe that the above equations have the same form as the
basic SIR model. Thus, τeq can be interpreted as the equivalent
transmissibility of the virus by considering all venues. The
above equations, in fact, are a proper generalization of an SIR
model to the case of multiple interaction venues.
Note that, Equation (31) has the interesting property that
infection transmissibility, τeq , depends on the overall distribution of quantities τi , ηi , and αi , across the venues. By
manipulating some of the venues (e.g., closing them), one can
thus reduce the equivalent transmissibility, τeq , of the disease.
Now let us break the local population into a set G of nonoverlapping groups. Let ηij denote the average amount of
time that individuals in group gj ∈ G spend in venues i (some
fractions could be zero). Also, let fij be the average fraction
of occupancy of venues i who are from group gj , and let τij
be the probability that an infected person in venues i who
encounters a member of group gj successfully infects them
(i.e., transmissibility). One can thus approximately rewrite
the product τi ηi as a weighted sum of per-group products:
