Abstract
Since the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, numerous forecasting
models have been proposed to project the trajectory of coronavirus infection cases.
Most of these forecasts are based on traditional epidemiological models. However,
many of these forecasts have performed poorly, mainly due to two reasons: 1) these
type of forecast models are highly sensitive to model parameters, which have wide
confidence intervals; 2) the models fail to incorporate the non-pharmaceuticalintervention (or NPI, mainly government policies, like “lock-down”, “shut-down”,
“stay-at-home” directives) effects successfully. We propose a new discrete-time
Markov chain model that directly incorporates stochastic behavior and for which
parameter estimation is straightforward from available data. Transition matrix models
(TMM) have been widely used in financial industry, mainly in credit analysis,
especially in predicting credit rating migration of corporate bonds, or delinquency
migration of consumer loans. The event chain of a consumer loan’s “early delinquency”,
“serious delinquency”, “default”, is very like the event chain of COVID-19’s “mild
case”, “severe case”, “critical case”, “death”.
Using such data from China’s Hubei province (for which Wuhan is the provincial
capital city and which accounted for approximately 82% of the total reported COVID19 cases in the entire country), the model is shown to be flexible, robust, and accurate.
As a result, it has been adopted by the first Shanghai assistance medical team in
Wuhan’s Jinyintan Hospital, which was the first designated hospital to take COVID-19
patients in the world. The forecast has been used for preparing medical staff, intensive
care unit (ICU) beds, ventilators, and other critical care medical resources and for
supporting real-time medical management decisions.

Empirical data from China’s first two months (January/February) of fighting
COVID-19 was collected and used to enhance the model by embedding NPI efficiency
into the model. We applied the model to forecast Italy, South Korea, and Iran on March
9. Later we made forecasts for Spain, Germany, France, US on March 24. Again, the
model has performed very well, proven to be flexible, robust, and accurate for most of
these countries/regions outside China.
Compared to widely used SIR-type models, we find TMM more flexible, robust,
and accurate for COVID-19 forecasts. More importantly, it has been adopted by
frontline medical professionals to support real-time COVID-19 medical management
decisions and proven to be a more pragmatic forecasting tool. Three out of the four
authors were invited to provide insights on this novel model at the Brookings event
“Fighting COVID-19: Experiences and lessons from the frontlines in Asia”3, which was
broadcasted international news agencies, including Caixin Global 4 , China Daily 5 ,
Reuters, etc. The model has also received wide attention in news media, including
Caixin, with a full feature article on its forecasts6.
We suggest that modeling teams around the world should take a closer look at this
discrete-time Markov chain model and examine its usefulness in the battle against
COVID-19, including the support for real-time decision making of preparing medical
staff, equipment, and other medical resources, as well as government/business planning
of when and how to impose/lift non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) policies.

1. Introduction
Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by zoonotic 2019 novel
coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) broke out in Wuhan, China during December 2019, and
was declared a pandemic by WHO on March 11, 2020. As of June 30, 2020, more than
10 million laboratory-confirmed cases and 500,000 deaths have been documented
worldwide. Among the tools used in the fight to contain such pandemics, forecast
models are critical in helping support not only medical resource management decisions,
but also in informing government policies, such as when and where “lock-down” and
“stay-at-home” directives should be enacted and lifted.
Traditional epidemiology models use deterministic differential equations to forecast
the population dynamics among various states, e.g., susceptible, exposed, infectious, or
recovered in the well-known susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model
recently used to model the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan (Wu, Leung, and Leung
2020). Such models have also been expanded to include additional states for COVID19, e.g., Giordano et al. (2020). These models are by design aggregate models that track

only the mean populations and do not incorporate stochastic effects directly and are
highly sensitive to estimated parameters. For example, a key parameter is the basic
reproductive number R0, or the rate (average number) at which one currently infected
person infects new persons; thus, an R0 < 1 indicates that the epidemic is dying out. An
inaccurate estimate of R0 is magnified in poor forecasts, leading to orders of magnitude
differences in output.
More recently, epidemiologists have been looking at agent-based models, very
familiar to the operations research (OR) community, where individuals can be modeled
in detail, e.g., age, gender, health condition, and stochastic characteristics are directly
incorporated. Such models can be very useful for studying smaller communities, but
since they typically require stochastic (Monte Carlo) simulation, may face
computational challenges in scaling up to large cities or countries when the number of
agents becomes large. Also, if the amount of detailed individual data available is limited,
then it would be challenging to estimate the model with any degree of confidence.
We propose a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) model, where the states of the
chain are similar to the states in the compartmental models. Since this DTMC modeling
approach is analogous to a financial forecasting model called the transition matrix
model (TMM), widely used in credit analysis (e.g., Malik and Thomas 2012, Chen et.
al 2018), be it corporate rating migration, or individual consumer behavior, we will also
refer to it as the TMM approach. For example, most major rating agencies, such as
Morningstar7, Moody’s Investor Services8, S&P Global Rating9, all publish their annual
transition matrices for corporate rating migration, so corporate bond investors can
estimate the likelihood of their investments getting downgraded in the future.
Transition matrices can also be stochastic, where the transition probabilities are
dependent on both the individual characteristics and other external variables. For
example, IFE Group (2012-201510) performed actuarial studies for the world’s largest
monoline insurance program, Federal Housing Administration (FHA)’s Mutual
Mortgage Insurance (MMI) fund, with approximately $2.7 trillion in assets under
management. They provided forecasts for the fund’s performance for as long as 37
years into the future. And tens of millions of mortgages are simulated for hundreds of
paths, to calculate the future expected credit losses, and loss distribution. The
calculation process is very time consuming, and can take as long as three hours, even
after simulation optimization. Transition matrices can also be hybrid (partially
deterministic, partially stochastic), where some probabilities are constant, and some are
time varying.
Transition matrix models share similarities with the above-mentioned agent-based
model used in epidemiology study. Our proposed approach has the following
advantages: it incorporates stochastic features directly while retaining essentially the

same states (compartments) as in the compartmental models; its discrete-time nature
and degree of modeling detail make it straightforward to estimate model parameters
from available data; it is computationally tractable both in terms of parameter
estimation and in terms of model output analysis.
The TMM approach has been shown to be flexible, robust, and accurate. From field
experience, the TMM forecast results have been used to support real-time medical
management decisions, allocate medical staff, and plan for business re-opening. Here
are some examples of the TMM forecasts used to support decision making in the fight
against COVID-19:
• On February 10th, the TMM forecast was adopted by the first Shanghai medical
assistance team (led by Dr. Zheng, one of this paper’s authors) in Wuhan’s
Jinyintan Hospital, the first designated hospital to take COVID-19 patients in
the world. The forecast has been used in preparing medical staff, ICU beds,
ventilators, and other critical care medical resources by central and provincial
health commissions and local CDCs.
• On February 14th, we published an article11, indicating that under the cautiously
optimal scenario, medical staff needed for taking care of severe and critical
patients could reach 40,000-45,000. Soon after this forecast, more medical
assistance teams were dispatched from all over China to Wuhan and other cities
in Hubei province. The total number of medical assistance teams reached 346,
with more than 42,600 medical staff, on March 812.
• We also published our forecast for Italy, South Korea, and Iran13 on March 9th,
and channeled the Italy forecast to one Italian cabinet member on the same day,
indicating a very dire situation with a forecast of more than 190,000 cases likely
to occur by April end. The Italian government implemented a national “lockdown” policy on the next day.
• On February 15th, we forecasted the “back-to-normal” date for Hubei province
was most likely to be mid-April (4/13-4/20)14. On April 8th, the “lock-down” in
Wuhan was lifted, and Dr. Zheng was able to come back to Shanghai after
fighting COVID-19 for 67 days in the epicenter of Wuhan.
This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we briefly discuss SIR-type models,
and discuss their major drawbacks. In section 3, we present the transition matrix model
for COVID-19 forecast and draw the analogy to transition matrix models used in the
mortgage finance industry. In section 4, we discuss model robustness, accuracy, and
flexibility of TMM, compared with SIR-type models. In section 5, we discuss the
effects of medical assistance teams dispatched from all over China to Wuhan and other
cities in Hubei province, which effectively increased the cure rate and reduced the
fatality rate, which is the major reason for the forecast errors for the cure and death tolls.

2. Specification of SEIR/SIR-Type Models
Prevailing epidemiological forecast models relevant to COVID-19 are based on
extensions of the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, which are
deterministic continuous-time dynamic models that model the evolution of the
aggregate population under consideration, where the population is separated into a fixed
number of mutually exclusive “compartments”. For example, in the original
susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model of Kermack and McKendrick (1927), the
compartments are defined as follows:
• Susceptible (S) – not infected yet;
• Infected (I) – assumed infectious with symptoms;
• Removed (R) – recovered (sometimes this is the definition) or deceased.
The three compartments are represented by time-varying functions S(t), I(t), R(t),
representing the (average) number in each compartment (state). The simplest set of
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) modeling the dynamics is the following:

!$

!$
!0($)
!$

= −𝑎𝑅+
= 𝑎(𝑅+

,($)"($)

,($)"($)

,

− 𝐼 (𝑡)),

= 𝑎𝐼(𝑡),

which has just three parameters (a>0, R0>0, and the population N).This system can be
solved analytically, but once any realistic features are incorporated into the model,
which is the case for real-world applications, numerical simulation is required, e.g., the
SEIR model of Wu, Leung, and Leung (2020) used for COVID-19.
Generally, compartmental models can be very effective epidemiology tools once a
disease is well understood and in a mature phase. They are also good theoretical models
for reference purposes, e.g., for comparing the infection rate of COVID-19 against other
respiratory infectious diseases such as SARS and MERS, by comparing the different
values of R0, once accurate estimates of model parameters can be obtained. However,
for forecasting purposes based on relatively sparse data, especially with regards to
patient-level outcomes (as opposed to aggregate cases), they may exhibit high
sensitivity to the estimated model parameters such as R0, limiting their robustness in
forecasting in the early and middle stages of epidemics. In the SEIR model of Wu,
Leung, and Leung (2020), R0 is estimated “using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods
with Gibbs sampling and non-informative flat prior,” so as we will shortly see, it is a
more involved process than the parameter estimation process for our proposed approach,
which relies directly on available empirical data.
There are several serious drawbacks to SIR-type models. The first drawback is its
high sensitivity to model parameters, which poses serious challenges in terms of model
robustness. A basic model driver in compartmental models (SIR, SEIR, and their
extensions) is the parameter R0, which indicates how contagious an infectious disease
is, and is also referred to as the reproduction number, because it represents the average
number of people who will contract the disease from one person with that disease.
5

Compartmental models are very sensitive to their model parameters, as well as initial
conditions, so accurate estimates are crucial if these models are to be used for
forecasting, which is not necessarily the primary usage for these types of models,
especially in the early stages of a new outbreak. A wide range of R0 values were
reported by different researchers, ranging from 2.0 to 5.7, as listed in Table 1 below.
Given this level of difference, the forecasted number of infection cases will differ by
200% in one week, 800% in two weeks, and 8000% in one-month’s time! If after 5
million infection cases and more than 330,000 deaths (May 21 data), scientists still
cannot agree on the very fundamental parameter, that probably suggests there is no
magic R0 that is universally applicable. And forecasts based on estimated R0 will be
highly unstable. Table 1 summarizes the forecast numbers of cumulative cases for the
R0 estimates, assuming incubation period of 5.2 days, as estimated in Li et al. (2020).
Assuming the initial condition is 100 infection cases, within three weeks, forecasts vary
from as low as 224 to as high as 3.5 million! Even for the same paper, the forecast
numbers can vary widely, and the max to min forecast ratio ranges from 5.3 to 720.
This table clearly illustrates high parameter sensitivity exhibited by SIR-type models.

In one SIR-extended model (Giordano, Blanchini, Bruno, et al. 2020), the forecasts for
Italy’s COVID-19 outcome are 40%, 0.25%, and 0.09% of total population infected,
thus the max/min ratio is close to 444 times, which basically make the forecast
impractical for medical resource planning.
Secondly, SIR-type models cannot easily incorporate NPI measures. They generally
assume that reduction of transportation and social interaction will reduce the
coronavirus transmission gradually, which is reflected in the reduction of inflow and
outflow of passengers, and transmissibility parameters such as R0. However, drastic
NPI measures taken by governments, such as lock-down of city blocks, communities,
6

and mass quarantine of close contacts not only affect the inflow and outflow of people
but also reduce the infection period, as close contacts are quickly tracked and
quarantined. These features are not well captured by such models. As a result, some
models over-forecast the infection cases by a large factor, e.g., Wu et al. (2020a)
estimated there would be 800,000 COVID-19 cases in Shanghai by the end of February.
But due to massive testing and contact tracing efforts of more than 700 public health
officials and 300,000 volunteers, all the close contacts of imported infection cases were
quickly identified and quarantined. As a result, there was not a single case of
community transmission and only 337 cases were reported by February end, for a
metropolis of approximately 30 million people.
In summary, from a practical perspective, if the goal of the forecasting model is to
provide support for decisions such as medical resource planning, including staff
(doctors, nurses, cleaning staff, etc.), supplies (ICU beds, ventilators, N95 masks, etc.),
and biohazardous waste disposal capacity, alternative modeling approaches may be
more aligned with the available data for estimating model parameters. Furthermore,
adding new compartments in SIR/SEIR models to allow differentiation between severe
cases (requiring hospital beds) and critical cases (requiring ICU beds and ventilators)
results in additional model complexity and the introduction of even more parameters
that are difficult to estimate from the available data.

3. Specification of Transition Matrix Model
We model the patient treatment process as an absorbing Markov chain with the
following discrete states (analogous to compartments in the SIR/SEIR traditional
differential equation-based models): (under) medical observation, discharged, infected
non-severe, infected severe, critical, death, and cured. The potential transitions between
the states are shown in Figure 1, where self-loops are understood but omitted in the
diagram for clarity, and the three states outside the treatment boxed labelled discharged,
cured, and dead are absorbing states. Note that “Infected” (represented as a decision
diamond) is not a separate state by itself in the DTMC model, as once a close contact
is a confirmed case of infection, it is immediately classified as severe or non-severe.
Another state called infected asymptomatic could also be easily added to the model,
but since there is sparse data to estimate this state15, we have not included it, and those
patients would not have entered the medical observation state in the current version of
the model.
One of the main differences between the compartment models and the proposed
modified DTMC model is that the former relies on parameters that have interpretative
meanings, so specific data are required to estimate them, whereas the parameters of the
proposed model depend only on transition probabilities between states defined based
on medical classifications where available data can be used to estimate them directly.
As an example, in the SEIR model of Wu, Leung, and Leung (2020), there are two
parameters corresponding to the mean latent and infectious periods, which are
challenging to estimate accurately from early data.
15

Back in February, asymptomatic cases were not reported in China.
7

Figure 1. Patient State Transition Diagram
Note that the states “Cured” and “Discharged” could also have been put together
into a single state (e.g., called “Healthy”), but for purposes of parameter estimation and
tracking statistics, the cure rate is of separate interest. The three states, Discharged,
Deceased, and Cured, are absorbing states, whereas the others are all transient states,
assuming non-zero probabilities for existing transitions in the diagram.
This is very similar to the transition matrix model (TMM) widely used in mortgage
finance industry. In the following chart, we can see a normal (current) mortgage can go
to early delinquency for missing 1-2 payments. If the borrower can make up the
payments, then she can return to the normal state. If she keeps missing payments, her
mortgage will be moved to the serious delinquency (SDQ) department for special
treatment. Sometimes even the mortgage servicing will be transferred to a special
servicer who is more sophisticated with SDQ loan servicing. One option is to go
through a loan modification via different payment reduction schemes, i.e., term
extension, rate reduction, principal forgiveness and/or forbearance. If a borrower can
successfully go through loan modification, she may return to the normal state. If a
modification is not working out, the loan may go to default.

The structures of Figures 1 and 2 share many similarities, which convinced us to
try a TMM approach to predict the COVID-19 progression. The transition probabilities
of the DTMC model can be either determined by regression or simply derived from
empirical probabilities.

The first application of TMM was to predict the COVID-19 progression in China’s
Hubei province, for which Wuhan is the provincial capital city and which accounted
for approximately 82% of the total reported COVID-19 cases in the entire country. We
adopted the empirical approach when estimating the model in our application to
predicting the COVID-19 spread in Hubei province, China. Specifically, we defined the
states of the model as follows:
l Under Medical Observation (UMO): state of a close contact of a potential infection
case, who is traced, identified and put into medical observation, generally in a
quarantine facility. From this state, the next day a patient may be confirmed with
infection, discharged without infection, or remain UMO (e.g., if the test results
have not come back yet).
9

l

Discharged (Dis): terminal state for a close contact after undergoing medical
observation, although one could possibly reenter as a close contact in the
generation phase.
l Infected but Non-Severe (INS): state for a patient with mild symptoms (generally
treated in makeshift shelter hospitals for Hubei COVID-19 patients). There are
three possible states for the next day: cured, worsened condition to severe, or
remaining non-severe.
l Infected and Severe (IAS): state for a patient who develops severe symptoms that
require hospitalization and oxygen support (WHO 2020). There are again three
possible states for the next day: worsening to critical, improvement to non-severe,
or staying the same.
l Infected and Critical (IAC): state for a patient showing critical symptoms and
requiring admission to an ICU (WHO 2020). There are also three possible states
for the next day: death, improvement to severe, staying the same.
l Cured (Cu) and Deceased (De) are two terminal states.
For severe and critical cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, multiorgan failure, including acute
kidney injury and cardiac injury. Treatment for these patients is very complicated and
requires extremely skilled specialists. For example, one of this paper’s authors, Dr.
Zheng led the first Shanghai Medical Assistance Team to Wuhan, with 150 medical
specialists. They worked at the ICU in the world’s first designated COVID-19 hospital,
Jinyintan Hospital, for 67 days, treating 170 severe and critical patients, with a cure rate
of more than 80%. Among these patients, 123 were critical cases, with a cure rate of
72.35%.
Note that “infected” itself is not an independent state, since the outcome is revealed
instantaneously. In addition to these states, there are a few other COVID-19 numbers
worth mentioning, and we also provide forecasts for these numbers:
l Daily new confirmed cases (DNCC)
l Cumulative confirmed cases (CCC)
l Daily active cases, or infected and under treatment (IAT)
Thus, each day, a patient’s state on day n is characterized by a state vector, defined
as follows:
𝑉(𝑛) = [𝑈𝑀𝑂 𝐷𝑖𝑠 𝐼𝑁𝑆 𝐼𝐴𝑆 𝐼𝐴𝐶 𝐶𝑢 𝐷𝑒]’,
where the value of each element can be viewed as the probability of being in that state,
so for each individual new close contact generated, the elements would sum to 1. For a
given individual in a known state, the corresponding element would be equal to 1, and
the other elements would be zero. For example, a patient currently in state “infected
and non-severe” (INS) would have state vector [0 0 1 0 0 0 0]’, and the next day, the
state vector could remain the same or transition to either [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]’ (severe) or
[0 0 0 0 0 1 0]’ (cured). Thus, for the entire potentially exposed population, the state
vector is defined as the count of people in each state. For example, at an early stage
with say 100 patients being tested or treated, out of which 30 are awaiting testing results,
10 are critical, 10 are severe, and 50 are non-severe, the state vector would be as follows:
[30 0 50 10 10 0 0]’.
10

Defining the one-step (i.e., daily) transition matrix P=@𝑝B,D E, where
𝑝B,D = 𝑑𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑚 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑖 𝑡𝑜 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑗,
we have the usual DTMC vector-matrix (one-step and multi-step) dynamic equations:
V(n + 1) = PV(n),
V(n + m) = P U V(n),
since the count of a certain state comes from itself, all other possible transitions into the
state (e.g., INS has two possible incoming states, UMO and IAS), minus the outcome
states (IAS, and Cu).
If the population is limited and the transition matrix is stationary, the above formula
will be sufficient in predicting all future outcomes, and of course, since it is an
absorbing chain, all the transient states would eventually go to zero, and individuals
already in the pool will eventually end up discharged, cured, or deceased (the absorbing
states). In epidemic settings such as the COVID-19 situation in early 2020, the
population is not fixed, and additional individuals enter into the population via the
generation of new close contacts in Figure 1. Every day, new close contacts are added
to the medical observation pool. In our modified DTMC model, these new individuals
are generated as a proportion of the current new close contacts, i.e., via
NCC(n + 1) = NCC(n) e-YY_Y[\]^__0\$_ ,
where the NCC change rate parameter is analogous to the basic reproductive number
R0 parameter in SIR-type models, in that when it is positive, the number of infected
individuals in the population is increasing, corresponding to an R0 value greater than 1.
Just as when intervention measures cause R0 to eventually decrease below 1,
correspondingly the NCC change rate will become negative. The NCC change rate is a
critical parameter in our forecast, but it is readily estimated from available data, because
it appears in a single equation, whereas R0 appears simultaneously in two (or more)
equations in SIR and SEIR models (e.g., the very simplest SIR model in Section 2 and
the SEIR model of Wu, Leung, and Leung 2020).
This DTMC state transition matrix model can be used for forecasts such as when
the infection peak time (maximum number of active infection cases) occurs, as well as
patient distributions (critical, severe, non-severe), which can be used for supporting
medical resource allocation planning.
Although there are three hospitalization states – non-severe cases (INS), severe
cases (IAS), and critical cases (IAC), for the COVID-19 Hubei province data, we had
only the patient count in each state but not the actual pairwise transitions among these
three states, so we combined the entire hospitalization period into a therapeutic state
“infected and being treated” (IAT) – also known as the daily active cases, which
minimizes the need for estimation for those unobserved transitions. Instead, we used
the proportion of patients of each state (INS, IAS, IAC) within IAT, to forecast the
number of non-severe, severe, critical patients. In addition, the model also tracks daily
new confirmed cases (DNCC) and cumulative confirmed cases (CCC), since these
metrics are tracked in actual data. From all these various data, the parameters of the
model can be estimated directly as follows:
11

• New Close Contacts (NCC) Change Rate : aNCC = ln(NCC(t)/NCC(t-1));
• UMO Daily Discharge Rate: pUMO,Dis = Dis(t)/UMO(t-1);
• Pr {UMO à IAT}: pUMO,IAT = IAT(t)/UMO(t-1);
• Pr {IAT à Deceased}: pIAT,De = De(t) / IAT(t-1);
• Pr {IATà Cured}: pIAT,Cu = Cu(t) / IAT(t-1).
And as alluded to above, estimating the count of active severe cases and critical cases
requires two additional parameters:
• proportion of severe patients: ρs = IAS(t)/ IAT(t);
• proportion of critical patients: ρc = IAC(t)/ IAT(t).
We collected all data from Caixin Data (a subsidiary of Caixin Group), who
retrieves the original data from China National Health Commission. We also collected
supplementary data from Hubei Health Commission, mainly for IAS, IAC count. The
data period starts from 2019/12/31 and ends on 2020/2/8, updated on a daily basis. Next,
we describe how we choose parameters based on these observed empirical probabilities.
The following empirical transition probabilities were observed on 2020/2/8.

As mentioned in the previous section when describing the DTMC model, the NCC
change rate (aNCC) is closely linked to R0 but can be directly estimated from empirical
data. This parameter has very strong policy implications, as it measures the
effectiveness and efficiency of non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) policies and
actions. A positive value indicates that the NPI measures are failing, as new close
contacts are increasing, whereas a negative value indicates that the NPI measures are
effective, as fewer people are contracting the coronavirus on a daily basis. The higher
the absolute value of the parameter, the more effective the NPI measures are. Since the
8-day empirical average of -6% is volatile, we considered three values for the model:
-1%, -5%, -10%. We could not obtain the one-day probability of UMO discharge rate
in Hubei Province, so we used the national rates. Since the one-day probability was
17%, and the 10-day moving weighted average was 13%, we tested the model with
both 17% and 13%. In Hubei Province on 2/8, the one-day probability of transition
from medical observation to confirmed infection was 2.15%, with a 10-day weighted
average of 3.94%, so we used 4% as our model parameter. The latest single-day fatality
rate was 0.35% and the 10-day moving weighted average was 0.63%. As this
probability was declining, we used the latest value (0.35%) as our model parameter to
12

be cautiously optimistic. The latest one-day cure rate was 1.40%, with a 10-day moving
weighted average of 0.91%. As this probability was increasing, we used the latest value
(1.40%) as our model parameter. From the historical data, the proportion of critical
cases is relatively stable, whereas the proportion of severe cases fluctuated more.
Neither of these showed monotone behavior, so we used the average (14.50%, and
4.50%) of the latest value and 10-day moving weighted average as our model
parameters to put more weight on recent observations.
In addition to the parameter values just described, we considered six different
scenarios to control for forecast uncertainty, based on three different values of the NCC
Change Rate aNCC (-10% optimistic, -5% cautiously optimistic, and -1% relatively
pessimistic) and two different values of the UMO discharge rate pUMO,Dis (17% and
10.5%, where 17% is more optimistic.). In Wu, Zheng, and Chen (2020), NCC Change
Rate was assumed constant, whereas in follow-up work (Zheng et al. 2020), it was
allowed to be time-varying to capture changes due to NPI implementations. Table 4
summarizes the scenarios and parameter values used in our model.

A summary of the daily update equations used in the model are as follows:
NCC(t)=NCC(t-1)exp(aNCC);
DNCC(t)=UMO(t-1)pUMO,IAT;
CCC(t)=CCC(t-1)+DNCC(t);
UMO(t)=UMO(t-1)+NCC(t)-DNCC(t)-Dis(t);
Dis(t)=UMO(t-1)pUMO,Dis;
IAT(t)=IAT(t-1)+DNCC(t)-IAT(t-1)pIAT,De -IAT(t-1)pIAT,Cu;
IAS(t)=IAT(t)rs;
IAC(t)=IAT(t)rc;
INS(t)=IAT(t)-IAS(t)-IAC(t);
De(t)=De(t-1)+ IAT(t-1)pIAT,De;
Cu(t)=Cu(t-1)+ IAT(t-1)pIAT,Cu.
The primary differences among these scenarios are the different values of NCC
Change Rate. This parameter has a very strong policy implication, as it measures
the effectiveness and efficiency of non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) policies and
actions. A parameter value greater than zero indicates the NPI measures have failed,
13

and new close contacts will keep increasing. If the NPI measures are effective, this
value should be less than zero, and less people contract the coronavirus on a daily basis.
The higher the absolute value of the parameter, the more efficient the NPI measures are.
The first generation TMM (Wu, Zheng, Chen 2020) used constant NCC Change Rate,
whereas the second generation TMM (Zheng et al. 2020) used a time-varying approach
to capture different NPI effectiveness and efficiency of different countries more
realistically.

4. Model Accuracy, Robustness, and Flexibility
In this section, we discuss the model accuracy via back-testing in Section 4.1. Then we
discuss model robustness, with respect to parameter sensitivity in Section 4.2.
Afterwards we discuss model robustness, with respect to an external shock event in
Section 4.3. Lastly, we discuss model flexibility in terms of adjusting to preventive
policy effectiveness in Section 4.4.

4.1 Model Accuracy
After February, we performed back-testing for the forecast with the actual numbers.
Key performance metrics, such as peak value of critical cases, active cases, month end
total cases were very close to model forecast under the “cautiously optimistic” scenario,
which was picked by us as the most likely scenario. The relative errors of peak active
cases, peak severe cases, peak critical cases, and February-end total cases were 1.0%,
20.1%, 7.5%, 1.3%, relative to the median of the two cautiously optimistic scenarios.

Regarding forecast accuracy, SIR-type models generally do not perform very well.
As mentioned earlier, Giordano, Blanchini, Bruno, et al. (2020) gave three forecast
scenarios for Italy’s COVID-19 total infection case estimates while the medium case of
14

0.25% of total population infected is the closest to the actual observation. The actual
infection case on 4/30 was 0.34% of total population infected, so the closest forecast
was off by about 36% at the end of April. In Zheng, Wu, Yao, et al. (2020), the TMM
forecast for Italy’s total infected cases on 4/30 was 192,593, while the actual was
203,591, with an 6% error. Regarding the peak of daily new cases, the TMM forecast
was 6,681 on 3/23, while the actual peak occurred on 3/22, with 6,557 cases, or a 2%
error. The forecast and back-testing are provided in Appendix I.

4.2 Model Sensitivity to Major Parameters
We performed similar parameter sensitivity practice for the TMM used for the Hubei
forecast in Wu et al. (2020b). Two major parameters are the NCC change rate, and
medical release rate, where NCC change rate takes values of -10%, -5%, and -1%, and
medical release rate takes values of -17% and -10.5%.
As can be seen from the following table, while the major parameter
NCC_Change_Rate changes from -10% to -1% (a ten-fold difference), and the UMO
Discharge Rate change from 17% to 10.5%, the max/min ratio is merely 1.5. This
suggests the TMM approach is more robust than SIR-type models.

4.3 Model Robustness to External Shocks
Next, we take a more detailed look by considering the daily dynamics through the end
of February. On February 12th, three days after we published our forecast (Wu, Zheng,
and Chen 2020), the Hubei Province health commission changed the diagnosis criteria,
and allowed those patients who do not have definitive PCR test results but have clinical
symptoms (mainly CT scan results) to be counted as confirmed COVID-19 cases. This
changed criterion increased the daily incremental cases by more than 14,000, resulting
in the spike shown in Figure 3.

15

Figure 3. Cautiously Optimistic Scenario Forecasts of Incremental Cases
The spike led us to consider a drastic revision of our model’s future forecasts to
adjust for the changed criterion. However, after carefully examining the implication of
the new criteria, we decided not to change our forecast, as we concluded the change
would not have too much impact on the forecast results for cumulative cases in the long
term, because it just confirmed suspected cases earlier, most of which would eventually
turn into confirmed cases. As long as our forecasts for new close contacts are not
heavily affected, the model should be robust to handle this surge in incremental
COVID-19 cases. Indeed, Figure 4 confirms that the incremental close contacts did not
change dramatically as a result of the spike in new confirmed cases. As a result, the
cumulative cases are back in the range of the two S2 scenarios by the end of February,
as shown in Figure 5. Also, the critical case numbers are not heavily impacted by the
spike, as there is an intermediate state of severe cases between critical cases and new
cases; thus, the spike in new cases is not immediately reflected in the critical case
numbers, so Figure 6 shows the model forecasts up to February 22 are good, after which
the results of the arrival of medical assistance teams led to a dramatic decrease. On the
other hand, the severe cases forecasts are clearly impacted by the surge, since there is
no middle state between the severe state and new cases, and that resulted in moderate
underprediction for the much of the month, as shown in Figure 7.
The arrival of armies of medical assistance teams throughout the Hubei province
in February clearly had a beneficial effect on reducing mortality rates and conversely
increasing cure rates in Hubei province, shown in Figures 8 and 9, respectively, where
the model forecasts gradually and consistently diverge for both of these cumulative
counts (cured and deceased) throughout the month. This is discussed further in the next
16

section. As a result, the numbers of cumulative cases are back in the range of S2
scenarios at the end of February.

Figure 4. Scenario Forecasts of Close Contacts

Figure 5. Cautiously Optimistic Scenario Forecasts of Cumulative Cases: The effects
of the spike in reported cases on February 12 are washed out by the end of the month.
17

Also, the number of critical cases is not heavily impacted by the surge, as there is
an intermediate state of severe cases between critical cases and new cases, so the surge
in new cases is not immediately reflected in the number of critical cases, and our model
performed very well before February 22, as seen in Figure 6.
The severe cases forecast is impacted by the surge, since there is no middle state
between the severe state and new case, and that resulted in moderate underprediction
for the about 10 days, as seen in Figure 7.
The death toll forecast was also close to actual, until late February, as indicated in
Figure 8. The improvement in February was mainly driven by the efforts of medical
assistance teams dispatched from other provinces to Hubei, and will be described in
more detail in Section 5. The cure forecast probably has the biggest forecast error, seen
in Figure 9. This is also due to dramatic improvements in medical resources and care,
closely related to the previous explanation for the decrease in death rate, so this will
also be described in Section 5.

4.4 Model Flexibility
As illustrated earlier, the TMM approach can forecast all states in the COVID-19
pandemic, including the intermediate states (medical observation, mild cases, severe
cases, critical cases), and the terminal states (discharge from medical observation, cure,
death). The model does not include asymptomatic cases. The inclusion of asymptomatic
cases can be readily handled by adding one more intermediate state, although good data
are not available for the asymptomatic population. Also, the major purpose of the model
is to predict the active cases, i.e., patients who are receiving treatment in medical
facilities, and the patient distribution of severe/critical cases to better manage medical
resources. Thus, adding an additional asymptomatic state not only unnecessarily
complicates the model, but also compromises its robustness.
In another paper (Zheng et. al 2020), we drew from experience in Hubei and other
provinces of China during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak and improved
our model to incorporate different levels of preventive policy effectiveness and made
forecasts for Italy, South Korea, Iran. Later, we applied the model to forecast the
COVID-19 progression in other countries, including Spain, France, Germany, and
United States. Most of these models performed reasonably well, and the forecasts are
included in Appendices I & II. We also estimate the preventive policy effectiveness
parameter in Appendix III.
20

5. Supporting COVID-19 Medical Management Decisions
In the very early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, the daily fatality rate of severe
(including critical) cases was extremely high, around 8%. On Chinese New Year’s Eve,
January 24th, the first medical assistance team was dispatched from Shanghai to Wuhan
to help the local medical staff. On February 10th, the TMM forecast was adopted by the
first Shanghai medical assistance team (led by Dr. Zheng, one of this paper’s authors)
in Wuhan’s Jinyintan Hospital, the first designated hospital to take COVID-19 patients
in the world. The forecast has been used in preparing medical staff, ICU beds,
ventilators, and other critical care medical resources by central and provincial health
commissions and local centers of disease control. For example, on February 14th, we
published an article16 indicating that under the cautiously optimal scenario, medical
staff needed for taking care of severe and critical patients could reach 40,000-45,000.
Soon after this forecast, more medical assistance teams were dispatched from all over
China to Wuhan and other Hubei province cities, reaching more than 42,000 medical
staff by the beginning of March. On February 15th, we forecasted the “back-to-normal”
date most likely to be mid-April17, but due to the extraordinary efforts of these medical
assistance teams, the lock-down in Wuhan was lifted on April 8th (and Dr. Zheng was
able to return to Shanghai after fighting COVID-19 for 67 days in the epicenter of
Wuhan).
During January/February 2020, two hospitals with 1,900 beds were built within
two weeks to accept severe and critical patients. As time went on, medical staff became
more experienced treating COVID-19. All these measures helped to reduce the daily
severe case fatality rate to a very low level of 0.5%, an almost 94% drop from the very
early stages, illustrated in Figure 10. The model forecasts in Figure 8 use the higher
fatality rate observed on 2/8, resulting in higher death toll forecasts.
Moreover, starting from 2/5, 16 Fangcang shelter hospitals were put into use,
accepting more than 12,000 non-severe patients in Wuhan. These shelter hospitals were
converted from stadiums, shopping malls, convention centers, etc. This measure moved
the treatment window earlier and placed patients with mild symptoms in these
makeshift hospitals to receive proper medical treatment rather than self-quarantining at
home, where there would be significantly heightened risk of family transmission and
community transmission. The daily cure rate of non-severe cases increased
dramatically from the level of 1% in late January to close to 10% in late February,
illustrated in Figure 11. The model forecasts in Figure 9 use the much lower cure rate
observed on 2/8, resulting in the significantly lower cure forecasts.
Finally, as a result of all these timely measures, the peak of actual active cases was
moved earlier to February 16, instead of the date originally estimated as between 3/13/7, as illustrated in Figure 12.

6. Conclusions，Ongoing Research, and Key Takeaways
We introduced a new discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) transition matrix model
(TMM) for modeling epidemic outbreaks that directly incorporates stochastic behavior.
Parameter estimation for the model is straightforward, so we applied the model using
COVID-19 data from Hubei province, for which it provided reasonably accurate
forecasts, with sensitivity analysis illustrating its robustness properties in terms of far
less sensitivity to parameter misspecification than traditional epidemiological
compartmental models. As a result, the model has been adopted by the first Shanghai
assistance medical team in Wuhan’s Jinyintan Hospital, the first designated hospital to
take COVID-19 patients in the world, and the forecasts have been used for preparing
and allocating medical staff, ICU beds, ventilators, and other critical care medical
resources and for supporting medical management decisions.
The proposed approach can forecast all the states in the COVID-19 pandemic,
including the intermediate states (medical observation, mild cases, severe cases, critical
cases), and the terminal states (discharged from medical observation, cured, deceased).
As mentioned earlier in the model formulation, the model applied here to COVID-19
does not include asymptomatic cases, which can be readily handled by adding one more
intermediate state, but was purposely excluded since the data for the asymptomatic
population is not available. Also, the major purpose of the model is to predict active
cases, i.e., patients who are receiving treatment in medical facilities, and the patient
distribution of severe/critical cases to better manage medical resources.
23

Similar to the finance academic community where the literature on asset pricing is
dominated by stochastic partial differential equation models for which stylized models
are used to generated closed-form solution and big-picture insights, the prevalent
modeling paradigm in the academic epidemiological research literature also values
stylized models, in this case based on systems of deterministic ordinary differential
equations. The first author has spent over two decades in the finance industry and
implemented many models for investment decisions, and believes that the model
proposed here follows the same vein of industry relying on more practically
implementable models. The proposed approach is a preliminary attempt to advocate
models that are tailored to the available data and anticipated usage of the model in
decision making, whether it be strategic policy, supply chain planning, or hospital
operations. Thus, the focus is on flexibility, ease of implementation, and robustness
rather than theoretical elegance.
In terms of ongoing work, Zheng et al. (2020) draws upon the experience from
Hubei and other provinces in China during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak
to improve the TMM model by incorporating different levels of preventive policy
efficiency. This led to forecasts for Italy, South Korea, and Iran, which were posted
online 18 on March 9. The forecasts for Italy were channeled to an Italian cabinet
member on the same day, indicating a very dire situation with forecast of more than
190,000 likely cases by April end with weak intervention efforts. The Italian
government implemented a national “lock-down” policy on the next day.
The best COVID-19 forecast model probably does not exist, but some models are
more useful than others, depending on the types of decision being supported.
Traditional epidemiology models, like the SIR-type models rely heavily on estimated
parameters such as R0 and could have very wide forecast ranges over a relatively short
period, due to high sensitivity and wide confidence intervals of key parameters. They
are useful for reference purposes but may have limited ability in supporting real-time
decision making. TMM models are mainly driven by empirical probabilities, and do
not require complicated estimation procedures. In our case study, they are shown to be
more robust, flexible, and accurate, once the clinical experts are involved in the
modeling process. They know more about fighting COVID-19 in the frontline. Their
experience is of immeasurable value not only in saving lives directly, but also for
building models that can help save lives through efficient allocation of medical
resources.
In the eyes of a hammer, everything is a nail. But it’s not true, so don’t go with the
“standard” models in the academic literature if they don’t fit the use. Fit your best model
to the data, not the other way around.
