Abstract
Human civilization is experiencing a critical situation that presents itself for a new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This
virus emerged in late December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei, China. The grim fact of COVID-19 is, it is highly contagious in
nature, therefore, spreads rapidly all over the world and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Responding to the severity of COVID-19 research community directs the attention to the analysis of COVID-19, to diminish its
antagonistic impact towards society. Numerous studies claim that the subcontinent, i.e., Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, could
remain in the worst affected region by the COVID-19. In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, it is important to predict
the trend of COVID-19 beforehand the planning of effective control strategies. Fundamentally, the idea is to dependably estimate
the reproduction number to judge the spread rate of COVID-19 in a particular region. Consequently, this paper uses publicly
available epidemiological data of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan to estimate the reproduction numbers. More specifically, we use
various models (for example, susceptible infection recovery (SIR), exponential growth (EG), sequential Bayesian (SB), maximum
likelihood (ML) and time dependent (TD)) to estimate the reproduction numbers and observe the model fitness in the corresponding
data set. Experimental results show that the reproduction numbers produced by these models are greater than 1.2 (approximately)
indicates that COVID-19 is gradually spreading in the subcontinent.

1. Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has
spread so rapidly around the globe that the modern world could
not have imagined its severity at the beginning of the outbreak
that started in Wuhan, China in late December 2019. On 05
January 2020, the world health organization (WHO) first released information on the disease outbreak that a cluster of
cases of pneumonia caused by an unknown reason was detected
in Wuhan city [1]. After that, the Chinese authorities identified
the disease caused by a novel coronavirus [2] on 07 January
2020. WHO temporarily termed it as 2019-nCoV [3] on 12
January 2020; was later officially named as “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)” by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses (ICTV) based on
genetic analysis [4, 5].
Initially, WHO declared the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) [6] on 30 January
2020. Eventually by evaluating the severity and alarming levels
of the transmission of its high contagiousness, WHO characterized the COVID-19 as a pandemic [7] on 11 March 2020.
With this declaration COVID-19 becomes the fifth recorded
pandemic after the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic [8].
As of 30 June 2020, COVID-19 is still in a pandemic with
10, 434, 890 confirmed cases and 508, 843 deaths worldwide
[9], and continues to climb globally. Unlike all other panPreprint submitted to Elsevier

demics recorded in history, large amounts of data and news
about COVID-19 are rapidly spreading and widely reported,
and scholars in various fields have been mobilized to concentrate on analyzing these data and proposing solutions. Since
the governments of different countries have responded to the
COVID-19 pandemic seriously, it is important that the researchers estimate: (i) the pandemic regionally based on the
basic reproduction number, (ii) the arrival of the peak time,
and forecast the time course of the epidemic by analyzing
the data on the total number of infected cases, (iii) the total
number of confirmed cases, (iv) the total number of deaths,
and (v) the total number of cases recovered, etc. Many researchers around the globe have estimated the prediction of the
COVID-19 spreading and the end of the epidemic in different
countries [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. Some of these
methods are based on statistical models [19, 20, 17, 21] and
some other methods use deterministic epidemic models known
as susceptible infectious recovery (SIR) with different forms
[22, 10, 23, 24, 25, 26].
Recently, some countries in South Asia, especially in
Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, cases of COVID-19 are increasing rapidly. In particular, the COVID-19 cases became
a new hot spot after countries began to relax locking restrictions. In this study, we use SIR, EG, SB, ML and TD models
to analyze data to determine the reproduction number and preAugust 25, 2020

dict the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in Bangladesh, India and
Pakistan. More particularly, this article investigates the basic
reproduction number R0 and effective reproduction number R(t)
using these models. Previous studies show that R0 is applicable
when an exponentially increasing epidemic starts in the case of
a completely susceptible population [27].
Contributions: The contribution of this article is twofold:
(i) estimating of R0 for Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, (ii) estimating R(t) which quantifies the transmission potential over
time. As the epidemic progresses, this parameter will track the
average number of secondary cases per case over time periods.
After calculating the R0 and R(t)s, we compare the spread of
COVID-19 in the region of concern. Experimental results show
that the R0 and R(t)s in all these countries are higher than about
1.2.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses related work, while Section 3 outlines the concept of
reproduction numbers. Section 4 describes several models that
can be used to generate reproduction numbers, whereas Section
5 explains information about the data source. Section 6 explains the experimental results. Finally, Section 7 summarizes
the paper.

ticle also attempts to put foresight on how human-to-human
transmissions may occur outside Wuhan by travellers. The article reported the median day-to-day reproduction number over
the time in Wuhan. The susceptible exposed infected and removed (SEIR) model is used for the evaluations. Besides, the
study attempts to incorporate the uncertainty of the detection
and observation utilizing Poisson process and binomial observation process on infection prevalence on flights.
Peng et al. [33] attempted to modify the generalized SEIR
model by incorporating quarantine into account and studied the
COVID-19 pandemic in 24 provinces in Mainland and 16 counties in Hubei province in China. The authors estimate the latent
time, the quarantine time, the reproduction number, the possible
ending time and the final total infected cases.
Wangping et al. [34] proposed an extended susceptible infected removed (eSIR) model essentially an extension to the
SIR model attempting to address the effects of different intervention measures in dissimilar periods. The eSIR is applied to model the pandemic COVID-19 analysis in Italy. The
markov chain monte carlo (MCMC) algorithm is utilized to obtain the posterior estimation of the unknown parameters in the
SIR model.
Chatterjee et al. [35] modeled a variant of SEIR for COVID19 epidemic in India. In this stochastic modeling approach
Monte Carlo simulation is used to model the concept with a
1000 run. The article shed into the hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) requirements along with deaths. Article
also presents the impact of the lockdown and social distancing.
Liang el al. [36] presents infection kinetic analysis of SARS,
MARS and COVID-19. Author attempts to acquire a propagation growth model by utilizing the growth rate, and inhibition
constant of the aforementioned diseases. The inhibition constant depends on the prevention and control measures adopted
for the population. The article assumes during the inception of
the disease cycle no effective measure is in place. It figures out
the growth rate, the multiplication cycle and infection inhibition
constant.
Ndairou et al. [37] provides a mathematical model i.e., essentially an extension to the SIR model of COVID-19 taking
eight epidemiological classes into consideration. They are (i)
susceptible, (ii) exposed, (iii) symptomatic and infectious, (iv)
super spreaders, (v) infectious but asymptomatic, (vi) hospitalized, (vii) recovery, and fatality class. Wuhan number of cases
and deaths are compared with the model.
Roda et al. [38] argued that these model predictions have
shown a wide range of variations. And the variation of the performances of the models is due to the non-identify ability in
model calibrations. The qualities of the statistical models are
studied utilizing the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Authors’ finding the performance of SIR over SEIR is explained
as the failure of the even more sophisticated model is due to the
more challenging realization of a comparatively more complex
model.
Contrary to the other school of analytical models where
the models used to predict the number of cases and deaths.
Hellewell et al. [38] attempts to quantify the effectiveness of
the contact tracing and isolation to control the COVID-19. The

A number of models have been proposed and applied to the
area of infectious COVID-19. The majority of the mathematical
models fall into the categories: (i) standard statistical models
applied to the COVID-19 dataset, (ii) deterministic epidemic
models such as SIR, SEIR etc. (iii) modified variants of the
well-known models attempting to incorporate specific criteria
such as incorporating social distancing into SEIR, and (iv) effectiveness of the contact tracing and isolation.
In [28], authors choose auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) to predict the spread of COVID-19 based on
Johns Hopkins University dataset [29]. Authors intend to avoid
potential biases of the evaluating model and select a simple
and economical model therefore chosen ARIMA. The ARIMA
model consists of an autoregressive (AR) model, moving average (MA) model, and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model [30]. Results demonstrate the
autocorrelation function (ACF), and the partial autocorrelation
function (PACF) prevalence and incidence of COVID-19 are
not influenced by the seasonality. However the claim is arguable as the COVID-19 may have seasonality influences; it
is just too early to claim.
Calafiore et al. [31] presents a modified susceptible-infectedrecovered (SIR) model for the contagion analysis of COVID-19
in Italy. Besides the regular SIR parameters the authors incorporate the initial number of susceptible individuals. Most interestingly authors consider a proportionality factor i.e., the ratio
of the detected number of COVID positives to the actual number of infected individuals. Two distinct algorithms (i) tuning
of the model parameters and (ii) predicting the number of infected, recovered and deaths are presented in this article.
Kucharski et al. [32] reported how transmission in Wuhan
varied over a time period (January - February 2020). The ar2

study considers a number of scenarios containing (i) initial
cases, (ii) R0 , (iii) delay in-between symptom and isolation, (iv)
probability of traced contacts, (v) proportion of transmission
before symptom, and (vi) proportion of sub-clinical infections.
Contrarily this study attempts to find the transmission potential in the subcontinent. Instead of relying on just one specific
model this exploration employs SIR, EG, SB, ML and TD that
realize definitive regional R0 and R(t) that get a conclusive outcome of the containment measure in place.

Consequently, R(t) becomes below 1. The implication is that
as herd immunity is achieved, the number of new cases in the
population will decrease to zero over time [41].
In this paper, we are going to estimate R, i.e., R0 and R(t)
through a variety of methods using the dataset of the selected
countries such as Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. In the next
section, we have explained the five most popular methods for
estimating of R0 and R(t).
4. Epidemic forecasting models

3. The reproduction number

There are numerous models that have been proposed and applied to the area of infectious COVID-19. In order to find the
transmission potential in the subcontinent, we used five models,
namely, SIR model, Exponential growth, Sequential Bayesian
method, Maximum likelihood estimation, and Time-dependent
estimation, briefly described in what follows.

Infectious diseases can be analyzed with a so-called reproductive number (R) that quantify the invasion or extinction of
diseases in a population [39]. More precisely, the R is mainly
used to determine the infectivity of a contagious disease. Alternatively, we can say that R represents the speed with which a
disease spreads in a population. So, the primary task is to impose policies to control the R in order to control the contagious
disease. This can be achieved by zonal shut down, social distancing and other factors that lead to control the outbreak of the
disease in a particular geographic region. Fundamentally there
are two types of Rs: (i) basic reproduction number R0 and (ii)
effective reproduction number R(t). The R0 refers to a measurement of the average number of cases that an infected person
can spread over the person’s infection period in a population
[40]. Let, the R0 of COVID-19 in a region x is y. Then, each
infection may lead to y number of new secondary cases in the
region x i.e., each infected person may infect y new individuals
in the x zone. However, R0 refers to a value that can indicate
that the rate of the infected population has fallen or increased
or remains constant.
Mathematically, R0 < 1 indicates that the epidemic is in decline and it can be considered as under control. Contrarily,
R0 > 1 implies that the epidemic is on the rise and therefore
cannot be considered as under control. And finally R0 = 1
demonstrates that the infection rate remains constant.
Contrarily, the R(t) is used to measure the infected cases
when there is a certain immunity or certain interventions are
taken place. In other words, R(t) is the number of infected cases
calculated in a certain population over the period of time t, taking into account that infected people are immune to infectious
diseases at any given time. Therefore, we use the actual reproduction number R(t) in order to measure the number of newly
infected individuals, on average, infected by a single person at
time t in a population. In effect, R(t) represents the time variant R of the susceptible population where the change may be in
decline or on the rise or remains constant. These three aforementioned conditions can be expressed as R(t) ≥ 0. Likewise
R0 , R(t) < 1, suggests the epidemic is on the decline and can be
considered under control at time t. At R(t) > 1 the epidemic is
on the rise and not in control at t. Finally, R(t) = 1 implies the
infection rate remains constant. Interestingly, R(t) and R0 can
be related to utilizing a simple relationship as R(t) can be measured with R0 ∗ S where S represents the number of infected
people in a particular population. In case the immunity to the
disease of a particular population is high then S becomes low.

4.1. SIR model
The SIR model is a basic mathematical model for describing the dynamics of infectious diseases. It is also called the
compartmental model because the model divides the population
into different compartments. More particularly, the population
of size N is divided into three compartments [31]: Susceptible,
Infectious, and Recovered, which will be detailed in what follows.
Susceptible: is the number of people who are vulnerable to
exposure with infectious people around at time t, denoted by
S (t).
Infectious: is a group of people who are infected with the
disease. Moreover, they can spread the disease to susceptible
people and can be recovered from it, in a specific time t, denoted
by I(t).
Recovered: is a number of people who get immunity in a
time t, denoted by R0 (t). Therefore, they are not susceptible to
the same disease anymore.
However, we can write the SIR model as a differential equation of each compartment [31]:
∂s
= −β ∗ s(t) ∗ i(t)
∂t
∂i
= β ∗ s(t) ∗ i(t) − γ ∗ i(t)
∂t
∂r
= γ ∗ i(t)
∂t

R (t)
where t defines the time, s(t) = SN(t) , i(t) = I(t)
N , r(t) = N ,
0
and N = (S (t) + I(t) + R (t)). Likewise, β is a controlling parameter that defines the number of people infected by exposure in a
specific time t, and γ defines the ratio of the infected individuals
who can recover in a time t. Using these two parameters (i.e.,
β, γ) we can estimate the (R0 ), mathematically, R0 = γβ , which
defines the average number of people infected from single disease exposure. Hence, if the R0 value is higher, the probability
of the pandemic is also higher.

likelihood-based method is used for the estimation of the basic
reproductive number (R0 ).

4.2. Exponential growth (EG)
The exponential growth (EG) rate is an important measure to
see the speed of the spread of an infectious disease. As introduced in section 4.1, the exponential growth rate can be written
as r = β − γ, where, β defines the number of people infected
by exposure in a specific time t, and γ defines the ratio of the
infected individuals who may recover in time t. However, r is a
disease threshold value when r is at zero (i.e., r = 0). If r is positive (i.e., r > 0), the disease can invade a population, whereas
it cannot invade a population, if r is negative (i.e., r < 0) [42].
The relationship between R0 and growth rate r is not simple.
For a specific distribution over generation time (e.g. gamma
distribution), it can sometimes be simplified. Assuming that
the generation time is completely constant, such as T , the R can
be written as [43], R0 = e(r∗T ) .

4.5. Time dependent estimation (TD)
Typically, the time-dependent R estimation is not straightforward, because we can only see the epidemic curve. There
is no information about who infected whom. However, using
likelihood-based estimates
Xof R, the time dependant R can be
written as [46]: Rt = N1t
R j , where Nt specifies the number
t j =t

of new cases at time t, and R j is the R(t) for X
case j, that is the
sum over all cases i, mathematically, R j =
pi j , where pi j
i

defines the relative likelihood. More precisely, the relative likelihood that case i has been infected by case j, normalized by
the likelihood that case i has been infected by any other case k,
w(ti −t j )
which can be written as follows [47]: pi j = Pi,k w(t
, where,
i −tk )
w(ti − t j ) defines the time interval of the infectious diseases.

4.3. Sequential bayesian method (SB)
The sequential bayesian approach can be used to estimate
the initial reproduction number (R0 ). Technically, the Bayesian
method works in the context of probabilistic modeling. Therefore, the probability model of R0 can be written as follows [44].
P[R0 ] =

5. Data source
We use a publicly available COVID-19 dataset1 extracted
from the coronavirus repository of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE).
This dataset contains daily observations on COVID-19 confirmed, recovered and death cases for most countries over the
world. More precisely, the incidence data are provided on a
daily basis. For this analysis, we consider data from South
Asian countries such as Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal,
Bhutan, Maldives and Sri Lanka. Nonetheless, the top three
populated countries (Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan) finally
have been selected for this particular article. Data dated upto
June 19, 2020 is utilized. The entire dataset of COVID-19 cases
of these selected countries is observed for each day, as shown in
Figure 1. In addition, the Table 1 sequentially displays the date
of the first confirmed case, the total number of confirmed incidences, the total number of deaths, the total number of recovery
cases, population and COVID-19 tested per million people in
each country.
The surprising fact is that these countries have conducted
very few COVID-19 tests in susceptible populations. Therefore, it is very likely that this data set may not cover the real
scenario of the COVID-19 situation. However, we can use this
data set to mainly calculate the reproduction numbers, so as to
observe the spread of COVID-19.

P[R0 |∇T (t + τ) ← ∇T (t)] ∗ P[∇T (t + τ) ← ∇T (t)]
P[∇T (t + τ) ← ∇T (t)|R0 ]

where, T (t) is the total number of cases up to time t, and the
occurrence of new infected cases over the period τ, and ∇T (t +
τ) = T (t + τ) − T (t). The probability distribution P[∇T (t +
τ) ← ∇T (t)] and P[∇T (t + τ) ← ∇T (t)|R0 ] are independent and
dependent on R0 , respectively. Hence, the sequential bayesian
estimation of R0 can be made using the posterior distribution
for R0 , at time t as the prior in the next estimation step at time
t + τ.
4.4. Maximum likelihood estimation (ML)
The maximum likelihood-based estimation relies on two considerations : (i) the number of secondary cases produced by an
infected individual follows a Poisson distribution, and (ii) the
expected value R0 . Suppose the data is a periodic incidence e.g.,
{N0 , N1 ,... Nt }, where, t is a time unit, and Nt defines the number of new cases at time t. Therefore, the maximum likelihood

6. Experimental results
We conduct several experiments to analyze the trend of
COVID-19 in the concerned countries. The first experiment
focuses on COVID-19 cases as confirmed, deceased and recovered to compare the COVID-19 situation in these countries. The
motivation is to understand the deteriorated conditions for the
COVID-19 pandemic in this region. Next, we conduct experiments through SIR, EG, SB, ML and TD models to estimate Rs
for these countries and predict the COVID-19 pandemic. The
result is analyzed to observe the model performances on the
COVID-19 dataset. For this, we use the R0 package provided
by R programming language to impletement the code for the
above methods [46]. More particularly, we employ estimate.R
function of R0 package to apply the above methods to a given
epidemic curve. The result is analyzed to observe the model
performances on the COVID-19 dataset.

slower from person to person compared to the other two countries and vice versa.
However the aforementioned argument is inconclusive and
rather unlikely as Bangladesh conducted the least amount
of tests per person compared to the other two. Figure 2
shows that SARS-CoV-2 tests per million people performed
in Bangladesh, Pakistan and India are 4892, 6117 and 9995
respectively. Clearly, more tests reveal more infected people.
With unexpectedly poor and nonuniform samples we rather not
conclude as above and investigate further and focus on how
COVID-19 is spreading in the subcontinent. Intuitively, the
subcontinent case may reflect COVID-19 spreading in the developing countries, especially spreading in South Asia.
Therefore, the further analysis focuses on the transmission

This subsection analyzes the COVID-19 data in order to observe confirmed, death and recovered cases in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. Figure 1 shows the number of confirmed (Figure 1A), recovered (Figure 1B), and death (Figure 1C) cases
in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan respectively. The Figure
depicts COVID-19 cases in all these countries are increasing
every day. In addition Figure 1, presents that the spread of
COVID-19 in India exceeds that of Bangladesh and Pakistan.
The Figure also illustrates that Bangladesh has less confirmed
cases and deaths apparently more control over the spread of
COVID-19 than India and Pakistan as it. Intuitively, the citizens
of Bangladesh comparatively better maintained medical care,
lock-down and social distances, as a result COVID-19 spread

cases will be 3, 976, 835 (assuming 20% of the infected population). Furthermore, around 1, 193, 051 (assuming 6% of the infected population) people need intensive care and up to 695, 946
deaths (assuming a mortality rate of 3.5%) (see Table 2).
Pakistan. Like Bangladesh and India, we have conducted
experiments on Pakistan’s COVID-19 data through the SIR
model. Figure 5A and Figure 5B depicts the observed cumulative infected incidence in cases and in cases in logarithmic scale
respectively. The figures indicate that the COVID-19 is spreading exponentially. In addition, Figure 5B shows that the slope
of the curve (black dotted line) was not accentuated till midMarch, indicating that the spread of COVID-19 in Pakistan. But
then it almost shot up, i.e., the COVID-19 is spreading rapidly
during this time period. In order to observe deeper insights, we
have conducted SIR model experiments on confirmed, death,
and recovered cases, as shown in 5C. The estimated values of
all the various parameters of the SIR model are shown in Table
2. It is worth noting that the estimated R0 of the SIR model
is about 1.22, indicating that COVID-19 accelerates over time.
We find Pakistan’s herd immunity as 18.18%. The epidemic
will be at its peak in 2020-08-03 with R0 remaining at this particular rate. According to the SIR model the maximum number
of infection cases is 3, 891, 427. Among them, the serious cases
are 778, 285 (assuming 20% of the infected population), the intensive care requirement is 233, 485 approximately (assuming
6% of the infected population) and estimated maximum deaths
is 136, 200 (assuming a mortality rate of 3.5%).
Comparison. Table 2 shows all the predicted values of various parameters of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan estimated
by the SIR model. It is worthy to mention that the R0 of
Bangladesh and Pakistan are very close, i.e., 1.22 and 1.23, respectively, while R0 of India is about 1.19. It concludes that
Bangladesh and Pakistan are experiencing an increasing number of infected people compared to India. In other words, India has so far somewhat stronger control over the spread of
COVID-19 compared to Bangladesh and Pakistan.
Next, we will use the rest of the methods (i.e., EG, SB, ML
and TD) to estimate the R in order to verify what the SIR model
foresees is consistent with other models.

6.2. Prediction with SIR model
In this experiment, we use the SIR model to predict COVID19 cases in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.
Bangladesh. Figure 3A depicts the SIR model fitting to the
number of observed confirmed cases where Figure 3B presents
the same observation in the logarithmic scale in Bangladesh.
We observe that the number of cases (black dotted line as shown
in Figure 3A and in Figure 3B) follows the number of confirmed
cases expected (black line as shown in Figure 3A and Figure
3B) by SIR model. Note that, the observed data and predicted
values overlapping with each other indicates COVID-19 clearly
is in an exponential phase in Bangladesh. Figure 3B shows that
the curve is flattening in between mid March (around) to 1st
April. This impliedly indicates that the spreading of COVID19 is comparatively in control in Bangladesh. Furthermore,
the slope of the curve dropping down in between mid-March
and April 1st conforms to the aforesaid observation (spreading
of COVID-19 is in control in Bangladesh during this period).
But then, the slope is going up at the steepest of all times until the end of May, i.e. in this time COVID-19 is spreading
rapidly. And then, the slope remains constant with a comparatively lower value.
Furthermore, we carry out the experiment to adapt the SIR
model to confirmed, death and recovered cases, as shown in
Figure 3C. With this experiment, we derive the estimated values
of various parameters as shown in Table 2. According to Table
2, we can see that the R0 is around 1.23 indicating that COVID19 is spreading in Bangladesh day by day. Based on the R,
we calculate the herd immunity threshold using the equation
1
[48], i.e., 18.97%. With this trend, the epidemic will
1−
R0
be at its peak in 2020-08-01. The SIR model estimates that the
maximum infected population in Bangladesh will be 3109, 321.
Of these, the serious cases will be 621, 864 (assuming 20% of
the infected population). It also shows that around 186, 560
(assuming 6% of the infected population) people need intensive
care and up to 108, 826 deaths (assuming 3.5% mortality rate).
India. Figure 4A and Figure 4B represents the cumulative COVID-19 infected cases in number and in logarithmic
forms respectively in India. It clearly depicts that the spread of
COVID-19 is in an exponential phase in this particular period.
In addition, Figure 4B shows that the slope of the curve
(black dotted line) was not steep in between February 1 and
mid-March, indicating that the spread of COVID-19 in India
was under control during this period. But then, it rose almost
exponentially, which means that this time COVID-19 is spreading rapidly. Furthermore, Figure 4C depicts the experimental
results of the SIR model for confirmed, death and recovered
cases. We put all the estimated values of all the different parameters calculated using the SIR model in the Table 2. The
R0 (derived from the SIR model is about 1.197) indicates that
COVID-19 accelerates over time, where the computed herd immunity is 16.97%. With this R0 the epidemic will peak in 202008-20. Moreover, according to the SIR model, the maximum
infected population is 19, 884, 176, among them, the serious

6.3. COVID-19 reproduction number (R0 / R(t)) estimation
In this experiment, we consider various methods to compute the value of the R0 and R(t). This experiment investigates
how the R has changed with the various methods of the estimation process, the role of excessive dispersion in the distribution
of secondary cases and the aggregation of the epidemic curve
at ever larger time intervals. In this experiment, we assume
that the sequence interval of COVID-19 for Bangladesh, India
and Pakistan is equal to the sequence interval of COVID-19 in
Wuhan, China with a mean of 5.2 days and a standard deviation
of 2.8 days [49].
Figure 6 depicts an estimation of R0 and R(t) for Bangladesh
(see Figure 6a) in the period from March 08 to June 19 (for 104
days), for India (see Figure 6b) in the period from January 30
to June 19 (for 142 days), and for Pakistan (see Figure 6c) in
the period from February 25 to June 19 (for 116 days), respectively. Moreover, Table 3 reports the computed R0 and R(t) for

lihood (ML) are 1.3809 [1.3803, 1.3815] and 1.2884 [1.2860

1.3446 [1.3443, 1.34448] with EG and 1.2591 [1.2579, 1.2602]
with ML and Pakistan 1.3192 [1.3189, 1.3196] with EG and
1.2645 [1.2626, 1.2662] with ML. Moreover, Table 3 also
shows the estimated values of R(t) for Bangladesh, India and
Pakistan using the methods of sequential Bayesian and timedependent. The results show that R(t) value for Pakistan is
higher than India and Bangladesh. According to the obtained
results depicted in Table 3, we have observed that for different methods the R does not follow the same trend of values.
Therefore, we proceed to observe the curve fitting using these
Rs on the COVID-19 data. Figure 7 shows that the R generated
by maximum likelihood (ML) and time-dependent methods fit
well to the data compared to the other methods for all countries.
Moreover, Figure 7 shows that SB method fits very poorly to

the data for Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. The results show
that Bangladesh and Pakistan have comparatively worse control
over the spread of COVID-19, meaning R(t) is getting higher
than that of India. However, it is worth noting that the R0 and
R(t) in each country are greater than 1, i.e., COVID-19 is still
spreading in all of these countries.
7. Conclusion
In this article, we provide an assessment of COVID-19 outbreak and measure the spread rate among Bangladesh, India
and Pakistan. We utilize the SIR model to predict important
parameters such as infection rate, recovery rate, herd immunity threshold, peak of the pandemic, maximum infected, severe cases, patients needing intensive care, deaths of COVID19 pandemics. We utilize EG, SB, ML and TD models to val9

idate the effectiveness of the estimated parameters of the SIR
model. For doing so, we find the basic reproduction number R0
and effective reproduction number R(t).
Experiments show that in all the considering countries, the
estimated effective reproduction number R(t) is much larger
than the basic reproduction number R0 , which means that the
containment measures implemented by Bangladesh, India and
Pakistan are ineffective and inefficient. Besides that, according
to different models the reproduction numbers of Bangladesh,
India and Pakistan are all higher than about 1.2, indicating that
the outbreak of COVID-19 is spreading rapidly.
Result directed recommendations are (i) to adopt stricter prevention and control measures, (ii) to improve the country’s
quarantine measures, define outcomes slowing down the spread
of COVID-19. Failure in doing so the pandemic situation of the
region may decline rapidly.
