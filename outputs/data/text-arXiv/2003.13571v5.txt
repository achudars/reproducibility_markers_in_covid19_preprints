We study a simple realistic model for describing the diffusion of an infectious disease on a population of individuals. The dynamics is governed by a single functional delay differential equation,
which, in the case of a large population, can be solved exactly, even in the presence of a timedependent infection rate. This delay model has a higher degree of accuracy than that of the so-called
SIR model, commonly used in epidemiology, which, instead, is formulated in terms of ordinary differential equations. We apply this model to describe the outbreak of the new infectious disease,
Covid-19, in Italy, taking into account the containment measures implemented by the government
in order to mitigate the spreading of the virus and the social costs for the population.

INTRODUCTION

In a very few months a viral infection called Covid-19 (Coronavirus disease 19) originated in China, breaking through
the borders of all the countries, rapidly spread all over the globalized world. Italy is one of the hardest hit countries
suffering from the very dramatic consequences of this disease. The outbreak of the virus, the new coronavirus which
caused the infection, seems out of our control. In the absence of a therapy and a vaccine, social distancing measures
and a strict lockdown appear to be the most effective means to contain the growth of the infection. We should remind
that there are places in the world where often infectious diseases, also those already defeated in the so-called more
developed countries, can still cause very severe consequences among the local populations.
Even if we cannot answer the question why a virus starts spreading and which is its origin, we can still wonder
how it diffuses. The aim of this work is, therefore, to provide a simple handy model for epidemic spreading, which
could depend only on the couple of parameters which generally characterize an infectious disease: the infection rate
and the infectiousness (or recovery) time. Both these quantities can be taken from the experience, therefore, we do
not need further parameters to fit the data which could cause artificial predictions. We will show that the model we
are presenting have the same, or even higher, predictive power than that of one of the most widely used technique in
epidemiology, the SIR model [1–3]. This latter model requires the presence of a recovery rate related to the number of
recovered persons, without considering that the new cases of recovery (and fatality) come from infected cases occurred
previously. The model we are proposing, instead, is based on the fact that the closed cases come from the infected
ones after an average delay recovery time, therefore, contrary to the SIR model, formulated in terms of a set ordinary
differential equations, it is described by just a functional retarded differential equation, bringing predictions more
under control. In this work we derive the exact analytical solution of this model in the limit of a large population, also
in the presence of a time-dependent infection rate, which is the case when containment measures are implemented in
order to reduce the spreading of the infection. Moreover, the definition of the so-called basic reproduction number
R0 (a parameter determining whether a infectious disease can spread or not) comes out naturally in our delay model.
Actually delay models in epidemiology have been already implemented in many cases [5–10]. We consider the case
where the infection period is constant and provide for the first time an analytical result for the spreading of the disease
in the early stage of the infection.
We finally apply this technique to give a quantitative description of the diffusion of Covid-19 in Italy, showing the
current scenario based on the actual situation and what would have happened without the containment measures.
Generally it is quite difficult to give a reliable forecast on the fate of the epidemic spreading because it heavily depends
on individual and social behaviors, on the effectiveness of the containment measures already implemented, or that
will be taken, by the government and on the future political decisions. At the time being, even if the situation in
Italy is improving, it seems that more efforts are needed in order to change course and rapidly stop the spreading of
the disease. Further measures might be useful, like, for instance, i) running more diagnostic tests, at least, on all the
doctors and medical workers who are in contact with many patients, ii) improving the food distribution to avoid the
crowding in the food shops and to ensure subsistence goods also to those who need, iii) providing medical devices like
surgical masks to all the population.
As last remark, we remind that the outbreak of Covid-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health
Organization. Many countries are already heavily overwhelmed by this infection and by the risk for the public health,
therefore, in a networked world we all have to behave and operate with an improved spirit of cooperation. The bitter
lesson imparted by this tough situation is that we cannot save ourselves alone.

RESULTS
The model

Let us introduce the model, assuming that the full population is constant, uniform, homogeneously mixed, and
counts N persons who can be divided in three parts, susceptible, infected and recovered persons, whose numbers, at
a given time t, are S(t), I(t) and R(t), respectively.
Let us define Io the initial infected persons at time t = 0, and introduce P(t), the probability of remaining infectious
at later time t after becoming infectious. P(t) is a monotonic decreasing function with P(0) = 1 and limt→∞ P(t) = 0.
The initial number of the first infectious persons, therefore, decreases according to Io P(t), meanwhile other susceptible
persons become infected after coming in contact with those already infected, with a rate of infection α, which counts
the number of contacts per unit of time, times the probability for a infected person to transmit the infection. The
probability of new infections at a given time x is, therefore, proportional to the ratio S(x)/N of persons who are still
susceptible and the number of infected persons who are still infectious, I(x)P(t − x). At a later time t, the total
number of infections are, therefore, given by
Z
α t
S(x)I(x)P(t − x)dx
(1)
I(t) = Io P(t) +
N 0
Equivalently, writing P 0 (t) =

Eq. (1) can be written as

Since P(t) is a non-increasing function, P 0 (t) is negative, therefore the last two terms of Eq. (2) reduces the increase
of infection due to the first term. For that reason we can identify those terms as minus the variation of the removed
cases

It is convenient, for the benefit of future discussion, to introduce the total number of infected persons, either those
who are still infected at time t, I(t), and those who recovered or died, R(t),
F (t) = I(t) + R(t)
From Eqs. (2) and (3), since S(t) + F (t) = N , we have that F (t) fulfills the following equation

which is valid for any choice of P(t).
Standard SIR model

If we now choose P(t) = e−βt , inserting it in Eqs. (2)-(3) we recover the well-celebrated SIR model [1–3]

where β is the recovery rate. In order to make a comparison with what follows let us solve these equations when the
population N is very large, and as long as F (t)  N , such that S(t) ' N . In this situation we have
dI(t)
= (α − β) I(t)

and solving dFdt(t) = αI(t), with the initial condition F (t = 0) ≡ Fo = Io , we get that the growth of the total number
of infections, at the early stage, has the following form
F (t) = Fo

Delay model

If, instead, we choose P(t) = Θ(t − T ), a step function, namely P(t) = 1 for 0 ≤ t ≤ T and P(t) = 0 for t > T ,
inserting it in the Eqs. (2), (3), being P 0 (t − x) = −δ(t − x − T ), we get

, therefore R(t) = F (t−T )+C, with C a constant value.
From the equations above it is easy to see that dR(t)
dt =
dt
We remind that, contrary to I(t), either F (t) and R(t) are both cumulant quantities, namely they are monotonic
increasing functions. Requiring that F (t) saturates at t → ∞, the constant value has to be C = 0, therefore

R(t) = F (t − T )

(14)

This equation describes the realistic fact that the total number of cases at some time t becomes that of removed cases
at later time t + T , namely after an infectious period T . This seems to be the case also for the new coronavirus
spreading, by looking at some reported data for Covid-19 in Italy, shown in Fig. 3 (see also Ref. [4]). Eq. (14) allows
us to write Eq. (5) in terms of only the function F (t). Eq. (5), for the delay model, therefore, reads



dF (t)
F (t)
= α F (t) − F (t − T ) 1 −
(15)

where F (t − T ) = 0 for t < T . This delay differential equation is known to be linked to non-Markovian dynamics [11].
If we consider the case where the population N is very large, and as long as F (t)  N , we can neglect the logistic

term, 1 − FN(t) ' 1, so to have


dF (t)

(16)

We expect that this functional retarded differential equation, Eq. (16), at least, at the early stage of the infection,
could describe accurately the spreading of the epidemic disease.

Basic reproduction number

Let us rewrite Eq. (16), for t > T , in the following form
F (t) − F (t − T )
dF (t)
= R0
dt
T

(17)

where we introduce and naturally identify R0 as the so-called basic reproduction number
R0 = α T

(18)

which is a widely used parameter for predicting whether the infectious disease will spread into a population or turns
off, and represents the average number of cases originated by a single infectious case during the infectiousness period.
Eq. (17) implies that the first derivative of F (t) is equal to its increment in a time interval T , divided by T , namely
F (t) is linear in t if the rate is equal to the critical value α = T −1 (R0 = 1). For α > T −1 (R0 > 1), the function

4

F (t) increases more than linearly, while for α < T −1 (R0 < 1), F (t) goes slower than linearly (see Fig. 1). If we
let α vary in time, when α = T −1 (R0 = 1) the function F (t) has an inflection point, where it changes from being
concave to convex or vice versa. Making a comparison with the SIR model, where R0 = α/β, one can identify β, the
recovery rate with the inverse of the recovery time β ∼ 1/T . Notice that R0 is well defined as long as F (t)  N ,
namely in the early stage of the infection. In general terms one has to define the generalized reproduction number
Rt = α(1 − F (t)/N )T so that Eq. (15) can be written in the same form of Eq. (17) with Rt instead of R0 .
Analytical solution

In this section we will provide the exact solution of Eq. (16). Writing the time t as t = nT + t0 , where n = b Tt c is the
integer part of t/T , the solution of Eq. (16) is given by
F (t) = F (nT + t0 ) = Fo

with A0 (t) = 0 for any t < T and A0 (T ) = 1, so that, for ` = 1, we recover A1 (t) = eαt . The full exact solution is,
therefore, obtained by solving a cascade of n local integrals. The proof of Eqs. (19) and (20) is given in Methods.
At time t = nT , from Eq. (20), performing the chain of integrals, and putting the results in Eq. (19), we get the

For instance, for n = 1 and n = 2, namely up to twice the infectiousness period, the total number of cases is simply
F (nT ) = Fo enαT − (n − 1) αT e(n−1)αT . Surprisingly we find that Eq. (21) depends only on (αT ), which is the
basic reproduction number R0 . It is easy to check from Eq. (21) that, while for large R0 = αT , F (nT ) is dominated
by an exponential behavior, for R0 = 1, F (nT ) becomes linear in n. From Eqs. (19) and (20) we can also write the

one can add an infinitesimal term  → 0, so to have (αt0 + )m . Once we have the total number of infections F (t) at
any time, we get also the number of removed case, R(t) = F (t − T ), and we can easily calculate, from Eq. (25), the
number of persons who are still infected, at a given time t, which, by definition and from Eq. (16), is given by

Comparison between the delay model and the standard SIR model

As we have seen, one assumption the standard SIR model is based on is that the time in which individuals remain
infectious is described by an exponential distribution, which is however biologically rather unrealistic. In reality,
infectious periods are fairly closely centered about the mean duration of an infection. A constant infectious period is
therefore a more realistic assumption. The conventional SIR model being formulated in terms of ordinary differential
equations, requires the presence of an effective recovery (and fatality) rate which might not correspond to the actual
rate since the new cases of recovery (and fatality) come from infected cases occurring a few days earlier. For that
reason, instead of writing the problem in terms of ordinary differential equations one has to do it in terms of functional
differential equations, as for the delay model. Even if the recovery rate of the SIR model is chosen to be equal to
the inverse of the average infectious period, the dynamics obtained by solving Eqs. (6-8) does not correspond to the
dynamics obtained by solving Eqs. (11-13). As shown in Fig. 2, even with the same initial conditions and the same

conditions Io = I(t = 0) = 150 and R(0) = 0, and S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = N = 6 × 107 , with parameters α = 0.23 per unit of
time and T = β −1 = 11 units of time (e.g. days), therefore the basic reproduction number in both the models is R0 ' 2.5.
(b) Total number of infected persons F (t) = I(t) + R(t), in log-scale, as a function of time from the standard SIR model (blue
solid line) and from the delay model (red solid line). The gray dotted lines are the analytical results from Eq. (10) for the SIR
model and Eq. (25) for the delay model, valid in the first stage of the infection.

R0 , the growth and the expected peak of the spreading of the infectious disease are quite different between the two
models, even if the asymptotic final values are the same. For R0 ' 2.5 the SIR model predicts a much lower peak of
I(t) with respect to that expected from the delay model, which is much sharper and occurs much earlier. In other
words, the outbreak of an epidemic disease might be underestimated by the standard SIR model. We notice also that
the analytic expression for F (t) in Eq. (25) describes fairly well the increase of the infection, at least in its early stage.

This general result implies that if we knew the time dependence of the infection rate or if we could tailor its evolution
by, for instance, containment measures, we can know the exact analytical expression of F (t), the total number of
infected persons, as a function of time, as long as F (t) is much smaller than N .

22th March 2020, compared with the closed cases, R(t) (blue dots), in the same period of time. If the numbers of closed cases
are shifted in time by T ' 11 days (blue circles) they fairly overlap with the total numbers of cases.

an example, let us suppose that α(t) is modified by social distancing measures, lockdown and the shutdown of many
work activities, as it is happening in Italy (and in many other countries) to mitigate and reduce the spreading of the
new coronavirus, Covid-19, after two main decrees imposed by the Italian Prime Minister ordering the lockdown of
the whole national territory, taken on March 11-th (lockdown and shutdown of many stores) and March 22-th 2020
(shutdown of many factories and strengthening of social distancing measures), and after some other measures taken

7
right before for local regions (e.g. the decree of March 8-th for the lockdown of Lombardy and other areas). As a
result, we can imagine that α(t) decreases smoothly after those dates taking into account the adaptation time for
the individuals to the new social behaviors and the period needed to complete the last activities before the blockade
of the factories. Let us suppose, therefore, that α(t) can change in time according to a smooth step function as in
Eq. (31),

which fits with the data, supposed to be reached after the first decree of lockdown, and α3 the supposed asymptotic
infection rate after the second decree of lockdown. Fixing the average of recovery and fatality time T , the reproduction
number is also a function of time, therefore we define
Rt = α(t)T

(32)

with a profile shown in Fig. 4. More precisely Rt = α(t)(1 − F (t)/N )T , but as we will see, because of the containment
measures, F (t)  N at any time.

FIG. 4: Time-dependent reproduction number Rt = α(t)T , as a function of time, based on the profile for the infection rate
described by Eq. (31). We take T about 11 or 12 days [4], t1 between 13th and 14th March 2020, t2 on 26th March, τ1 ∼ 2
days, τ2 ∼ 1 day. The initial value is R0 = α1 T ' 2.65 (in agreement with other estimates, see e.g. [13]), the intermediate
value is Rt = α2 T ' 1.45, and the final value, Rt = α3 T ' 0.85. The vertical dotted blue lines point the dates of the main
laws for the containment measures (8th-11th March and 22th March 2020). The gray dotted lines correspond to Rt in the
absence of the first and the second containment measures.

Solving Eq. (30), or, analogously, using the recursive relation in Eq. (29), with the time-dependent rate α(t) given by
Eq. (31), with the parameters reported in Fig. 4, we obtain the solution F (t) which slowly goes to saturation over
time, in perfect agreement with the data for the total number of confirmed infected cases, as shown by Fig. 5, where
the blue line is the expected curve, while the red points are the official data. The dotted gray lines in Fig. 5 represent
F (t) if the containment measures had not been taken. As one can see from Figs. 4-5, only when Rt becomes smaller
than 1, the curve flattens allowing for a stop of the epidemic spreading, avoiding that a large part of the population
gets infected. For Rt ' 1, F (t) would increase linearly, and I(t) would become almost constant, meaning that the
number of new infections would be equal to the number of closed cases. A reliable forecast has to take into account the
fact that the official data of infectious cases are made by counting mostly the symptomatic cases, probably discarding
other infectious cases which could transfer the virus even without or with mild symptoms. Moreover, the data of both
the total number of infected persons and that of the recovered ones could be affected by the procedure, the realization
times and the number of the diagnostic tests. However, since our model relies on the infectiousness time, it does not
need a fitting of the data for recovered persons which may be affected by systematic errors. This uncertainty on the
data for closed cases would compromise the result for the SIR model. On the contrary, our theoretical prediction
based on the delay model agrees fairly well with the data-set for total infected cases, as shown in Fig. 5.
As a final remark we remind that most of the confirmed infected cases in Italy are counted after the appearance of
the symptoms and the persons who exhibit severe ones are mostly hospitalized, and afterwards counted as infected
persons. Some of them, unfortunately, die approximately 4 days after (therefore after approximately 9 days from the
onset of the first symptoms, as reported by the Istituto Superiore di Sanità [14]). We observe that, splitting the closed

8
cases between real recovered persons, RR , and dead persons, RD ,
R(t) = RR (t) + RD (t)

(33)

and since the confirmation of recovery needs extra diagnostic tests which are not widely performed yet, the most
reliable data are those related to dead persons RD (t), which are found to be linked to the total number of confirmed
infected cases, F (t), in the following way
RD (t) ' γ F (t − Td )

(34)

with γ = 71 and a delay time of Td = 4 days, as show in Fig. 6. The number of victims follows the number of total
confirmed cases and it is equal to 1/7 of its value four days before.

DISCUSSION

We present a simple but realistic model for describing epidemic spreading, based on the fact that the closed cases
come from infected ones at an early time. This observation allows us to formulate the problem in terms of a single
functional differential equation depending on two well defined clinically relevant parameters: the infection rate and the
infectiousness time. We provide the exact analytical solution for such an equation, in the limit of a large population,
finding how it depends on the basic reproduction number R0 = αT , see Eqs. (21) and (25). Contrary to the result of
the conventional SIR model, the total number of cases has a combined polynomial and exponential growth. We derive
the analytic solution also in the presence of a generic time-dependent infection rate, which is the case when some
measures are taken to weaken the spreading of the epidemic disease. We apply, therefore, our model to study the
spreading of Covid-19 in Italy, allowing the infection rate to vary in time, as a result of some containment measures
implemented by the government in order to mitigate the consequences of the infection on the population. We find
perfect agreement between the official data and the expected theoretical results. In general terms, the reproduction
number should be suppressed well below 1 in order to rapidly recover the initial condition. By a rough estimation, in
order to have a decline of the infection as fast as its growth, containment measures or possible therapies should be so
effective to reduce the basic reproduction number and reach the final value Rf such that Rf ' 2RR00−1 , starting from
an initial value R0 . In the case of Covid-19 in Italy, the initial value for the basic reproduction number was R0 ' 2.6,
while the current one (April) seems to settle at Rf ' 0.8, implying a rather slow decline of the infection. Finally we
discussed the fatality rate, showing that the number of victims is exactly a fraction of the total number of cases few
days before. Before we conclude a final comment is in order. The confirmed cases are mostly symptomatic or mild
symptomatic. There are also asymptomatic cases which may contribute to the spreading of the infection. However, by
scaling arguments, the infection rates of the symptomatic and asymptomatic are expected to be equal, otherwise either
symptomatic or asymptomatic cases might become irrelevant. Under the hypothesis that the infectiousness time does
not depend on the strength of the symptoms, the ratio between the total number of asymptomatic and symptomatic
cases should be constant, although it could be very large. As a result, the total number of infected persons should be
equal to the number of symptomatic cases times an overall pre-factor greater than one. The conclusion is, therefore,
that, as far as the time evolution of the infection is concerned, which is the aim of this work, the study of only
symptomatic cases is still relevant and greatly meaningful.

METHODS
Solution of the retarded differential equation

For t ≤ T , the solution of Eq. (16) is F (t) = Fo eαt . Let us consider t = T + dt with infinitesimal dt, from Eq. (16)
F (T + dt) = F (T ) + dt α (F (T ) + F (0)) = F (T ) (1 + α dt) − Fo α dt = Fo eαT (1 + α dt) − Fo α dt

(35)

Using this result we can calculate


F (T + 2dt) = F (T + dt) + dt α (F (T + dt) + F (dt)) = Fo eαT (1 + α dt)2 − Fo α dt (1 + α dt) + eαdt

(36)

Analogously, from that, we can proceed calculating


F (T +3dt) = F (T +2dt)+dt α (F (T + 2dt) + F (2dt)) = Fo eαT (1+α dt)3 −Fo α dt (1 + α dt)2 + eαdt (1 + α dt) + e2αdt
(37)
and going on by adding infinitesimal time steps, we find iteratively that
F (T + m dt) = Fo eαT (1 + α dt)m − Fo α dt

In particular, for m dt = T , we have an expression for F (2T ) in terms of the function at early time, F (2T ) =
F (T )A2 (T ). We can now start again with the iteration
F (2T + dt) = F (2T )(1 + α dt) − α dtF (T ) = F (T )A2 (T ) (1 + α dt) − α dtF (T )
One can proceed in the same way as before getting
