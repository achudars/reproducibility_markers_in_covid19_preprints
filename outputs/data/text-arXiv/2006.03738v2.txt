Abstract Countries in Europe took different mobility
containment measures to curb the spread of COVID19. The European Commission asked mobile network
operators to share on a voluntarily basis anonymised
and aggregate mobile data to improve the quality of
modelling and forecasting for the pandemic at EU level.
In fact, mobility data at EU scale can help understand
the dynamics of the pandemic and possibly limit the
impact of future waves. Still, since a reliable and consistent method to measure the evolution of contagion
at international level is missing, a systematic analysis
of the relationship between human mobility and virus
spread has never been conducted. A notable exceptions
are France and Italy, for which data on excess deaths,
an indirect indicator which is generally considered
to be less affected by national and regional assumptions, are available at department and municipality
level, respectively. Using this information together with
anonymised and aggregated mobile data, this study
shows that mobility alone can explain up to 92% of the
initial spread in these two EU countries, while it has
a slow decay effect after lockdown measures, meaning
that mobility restrictions seem to have effectively contribute to save lives. It also emerges that internal mobility is more important than mobility across provinces
and that the typical lagged positive effect of reduced

human mobility on reducing excess deaths is around
14–20 days. An analogous analysis relative to Spain, for
which an IgG SARS-Cov-2 antibody screening study
at province level is used instead of excess deaths statistics, confirms the findings. The same approach adopted
in this study can be easily extended to other European
countries, as soon as reliable data on the spreading
of the virus at a suitable level of granularity will be
available. Looking at past data, relative to the initial
phase of the outbreak in EU Member States, this study
shows in which extent the spreading of the virus and
human mobility are connected. The findings will support policymakers in formulating the best data-driven
approaches for coming out of confinement and mostly
in building future scenarios in case of new outbreaks.

1 Introduction
By means of a letter sent on 8 April 2020, the European
Commission asked European mobile network operators
(MNOs) to share fully anonymised aggregate mobility
data to deliver insights to help fight COVID-19. The
aim of the initiative is further specified by the recommendation to support exit strategies policies through
mobile data and apps [5] with data-driven models that
indicate the potential effects of the relaxation of the
physical distancing measures [6].

Indeed, MNOs can offer a wealth of data on mobility and social interactions. While the value of mobile
positioning personal data to describe human mobility
has been explored [2] and its potential in epidemiology
studies demonstrated [16,17,25–27], the aim of this
research is to show that also anonymised and aggregated MNOs data, in compliance with the ‘Guidelines
on the use of location data and contact tracing tools in
the context of the COVID-19 outbreak’ by the European Data Protection Board EDPB [3], could serve to
explain the dynamics of the virus outbreak without the
need of disclosing any personal data, nor using tracing
applications.
The analysis in this study exploits data from four
MNOs relatively to three EU Member States (France,
Italy and Spain), together with different types of official statistics on the spread of COVID-19 across these
countries; the objective is to understand whether or not
human mobility matters in the expansion phase of the
pandemic.
The paper is organised as follows: Sect. 2 briefly
explains the nature of the mobile data used in this work,
while Sect. 3 investigates the case of France, taking into
account the internal and outbound movements from the
Haut-Rhin department (one of the initial hotbeds) to
the rest of the country, in order to establish the role
of human mobility in explaining the dynamics of the
early spread of the virus. The result show that significantly higher excess mortality in other departments
can be explained by their connectivity to Haut-Rhin
(R 2 up to 0.92). This relationship is valid until mobility is severely reduced due to the national lockdown in
force since the 16 March 2020. It also finds out that the
curve of cumulative excess deaths in Haut-Rhin correlates almost perfectly (from R 2 = 0.69 to R 2 = 0.98
after shifting) with the curve of mobility reduction for
the same region, showing a lag of 14 days between the
two curves.
Section 4 focuses on the virus spread in Italy, showing rather similar results to the French case (R 2 up
to 0.91 and lagged effect of 14–20 days, depending
on the provinces) and confirming that human mobility has an high impact on the virus spread. Since the
excess mortality data for Italy is available at municipality level, we have tested the same method also at this
higher spatial granularity (the analysis for France is at
Departments level), finding an analogous relationship
between mobility and excess deaths in the initial phase

123

of the outbreak; this confirms that the results hold at
different geographical scales.
Section 5, focuses on Spain, for which instead of
the excess death statistics (that are not available at a
suitable spatial granularity) we consider the IgG SARSCov-2 antibody screening study put in place at province
level between the end of April and mid-May 2020. In
this case, only correlation can be tested, and the results
show that the number of people found to be positive
to IgG test is highly correlated (ρ up to 75%) with the
human mobility derived by the mobile data from the
MNOs. It is worth underlining that since, as noticed in
Salje et al. [21], population immunity appears insufficient to avoid a second wave without lockdown or other
containment measures, this work may provide further
insights on the effectiveness of containment measures.
Section 6 goes through the main caveats and limitation of the research, pointing out the hypothesis adopted
by the proposed analysis.
Finally, Sect. 7 draws some considerations about the
research and highlights the main findings.

2 Mobile positioning data and mobility indicators
The agreement between the European Commission and
the mobile network operators (MNOs) defines the basic
characteristics of fully anonymised and aggregate data
to be shared with the Commission’s Joint Research
Centre (JRC1 ). The JRC processes the heterogeneous
sets of data from the MNOs and creates a set of mobility
indicators and maps at a level suitable to study mobility
comparatively across countries; this level is referred to
as ‘common denominator’.
The following subsections briefly describe the original mobile positioning data from the MNOs and the
mobility indicator derived by JRC, respectively.

2.1 Origin–destination matrix
Data from MNOs are provided to JRC in the form of
origin–destination matrices (ODMs) [7,20]. Each cell
[i − j] of the ODM shows the overall number of ‘movements’ (also referred to as ‘trips’ or ‘visits’) that have

early stages of the virus outbreak in the country. The
choice of these three countries is attributed to the availability of ancillary data at high level of granularity in
space and time, which are needed for correlation analysis with mobility insights. The mobility within the
country is derived using the ‘connectivity matrices’ that
are introduced in the following section.

2.2 Connectivity matrix

been recorded from the origin geographical reference
area i to the destination geographical reference area j
over the reference period. In general, an ODM is structured as a table showing:
•
•
•
•

reference period (date and, eventually, time);
area of origin;
area of destination;
count of movements.

Despite the fact that the ODMs provided by different
MNOs have similar structure, they are often very heterogeneous. Their differences can be due to the methodology applied to count the movements, to the spatial
granularity or to the time coverage. Nevertheless, each
ODM is consistent over time and relative changes are
possible to be estimated. This allows defining common
indicators (such as ‘mobility indicators’ [22], ‘connectivity matrices’ and ‘mobility functional areas’ [13] that
can be used, with all their caveats, by JRC in the framework of this joint initiative.
Although the ODM contains only anonymised and
aggregate data, in compliance with the EDPB guidelines [3], upon the reception of each ODM, the JRC carries out a ‘Reasonability Test’. Both the reasonability
test and the processing of the ODM to derive mobility
indicators take place within the JRC’s Secure Platform
for Epidemiological Analysis and Research (SPEAR).
This study presents an exploratory analysis for specific outbreaks in France, Italy and Spain, showing and
quantifying the relative importance of mobility in the

Besides the formulation of ‘mobility indicators’ [22]
and ‘mobility functional areas’ [13], an additional
example of ‘common denominator’ to guarantee comparable indicators across countries is a measure of connectivity at less granular level, using the common statistical classification of territorial units (NUTS2 ). The
NUTS3 level was selected in this framework, where
the average population size of administrative units in
Member States lie between 150.000 and 800.000.
The connectivity matrix at time t is represented by
the origin–destination matrix O D Mi, j (t) as extracted
from normalised and aggregated data received from
MNOs. With reference to Fig. 1, considering the
NUTS3 area A (rows and columns a1, a2 and a3) and
the destination area B (rows and columns b1, b2), then
the relevant connectivity is calculated as follows:
ODM A,B (t) =



ODMi, j (t)

(1)

i∈{a1 ,a2 ,a3 } j∈{b1 ,b2 }

The resulting connectivity matrix is obtained by
averaging over 1 week of data. The present study only
makes use of outward and internal movements along
one row of the matrix and later focuses only on movements internal to departments, i.e. making use only of
the diagonal of the connectivity matrix.

heavily affected by the type and volume of the testing procedures [1], which generally varies both across
departments and in time as the contagion evolves, we
instead have used the total number of (officially confirmed) deaths by departments (see Fig. 2 left) over the
period 1 March 2020–27 April 2020 [14]. France is a
special case study thanks to the availability of highresolution deaths counts and our results seem to con-

firm and complement the analysis in [21]. In our analysis, we consider the daily cumulative number of excess
deaths with respect to the same period of 2019, assuming that most of these excess cases are due to COVID-19
[8,23,28]. A visual inspection of the data shows that the
cumulative sum of excess deaths by department (Fig. 2
middle) for the period 1–25 March 2020 is correlated
with the connectivity (Fig. 2 right) from Haut-Rhin dur-

Fig. 3 a The R 2 is explained mostly by the mobility indicator
and reaches its maximum on 16 March 2020. When the lockdown
measures are in force, then the spread is explained by the distance
from the Haut-Rhin department, where the spreading of the virus
has believed to have started, but also other factors captured by the

constant effect. b The p values of the coefficients are presented.
The horizontal line represents the 0.05 significance level and c

(Color figure online)

ing the week of 23–29 February 2020 (which is supposed to be the start of the pandemic in France). To
study the impact of mobility on the spread of COVID19 in France, we fit a simple statistical model that aims
at explaining the excess deaths of Haut-Rhin in terms
of human mobility as well as the distance between the
department of Haut-Rhin and all other departments. We
aim to measure the relative importance of connectivity (or human mobility) compared to the geographical
distance for the spread of the virus.
Although mobility can only explain part of the
spread of COVID-19, in order to show the relative
importance of the mobility component, we run the simple quadratic regression model of equation:

2
yid = const + α1 log(mobilityi ) + α2 log(mobilityi )
+α3 distancei
(2)

03-01, …, 2020-04-27). The variable distancei is the
geographical distance between the department HautRhin and the department i and mobilityi is the normalised Mobility Index from Haut-Rhin to the department i for the week of 23–29 February 2020. As we
consider log-scaled mobility, we drop the departments
for which the outbound mobility from Haut-Rhin is
zero, i.e. we only fit this and the other models for
which mobilityi > 0. The idea behind this data-driven
approach is to let the data tell us under which conditions and when the mobility data do matter in studying
the contagion and when they do not. The choice of the
very simple structure of model (2) is to capture clearly
the impact of mobility, and the scope of the model is
not to forecast cases or fatalities, but to inform about
the dynamics of the COVID-19 due to human mobility. The quadratic form of the model is suggested by the
data itself as shown in Fig. 4. We also fit two reduced
models with mobility only (3) and distance only (4):

where yid is the number of cumulative death excess for
department i from 1 March 2020 till date d (d = 2020-

Fig. 4 Data for log-mobility and cumulative excess deaths on 16
March 2020. Red represents the selected subset of positive excess
deaths and mobility. The other points are the residual data. Red
and light blue together represent the whole data. The two curves

correspond to the fitted model (2) for both data sets. The straight
line represent simple linear regression of the two variables in the
plot. (Color figure online)

and

model (3) is almost equally good (R 2 = 0.51). Then, on
the long run, the distance becomes slightly more important, but clearly the rest of the variability is explained
by the mix of the three. This figure also supports an
argument that the department of Haut-Rhin could have
been the initial source of the outbreak of COVID-19 in
France. It also demonstrates the positive impact of the
lockdown measures on the reduction of excess deaths.
Figure 3 also shows the standardised coefficients of
the full model (2) as a function of time. Standardised
coefficients are all on the same scale, and thus, their
values can be compared in terms of their impact on the
outcome variable. Looking at the plot, then it becomes
clear that the mobility coefficient is the largest effect up
to 27 March; then, the excess death number is explained
by the constant in the model, i.e. by other factors not
included in the simple regression analysis.

yid = const + γ1 distancei .

(4)

For each model, we evaluate the R 2 index as well as
the significance of each coefficient. To further stress the
relative importance of the variables in the full model
(2), we consider the evolution of the standardised coefficients in time. Figure 3 shows the goodness of fit of
the three competing models in terms of R 2 and the p
value of the estimated coefficients. The vertical lines
set on 9 and 13 March represent two large gatherings
in the Haut-Rhin region and that on 16 March the first
lockdown measure (schools closure). The next three
lines are translated by 14 days, which corresponds to the
median number of days from the occurrence of the first
symptom to death [18]. Figure 3 shows that the model
(2) dominates the other two but also that, up to the maximum value of the R 2 = 0.52 (around 18 March), the

The explanatory impact of mobility can be improved
further if we select those cases for which the mobility
index and the cumulative excess deaths are both positive. This selection is natural both because what is interesting is the positive excess of deaths and because, due
to the process of non-identification and anonymisation
of the data, some entries of the original OD matrix are
cut to zero by construction. Figure 4 shows the scatterplot of the two dimensions for all the departments
and the further selection of data (cut). The reference

data chosen is 16 March as it is the date for which the
R 2 = 0.92 of the full model, under the selected sample,
is maximal. For the selected data, the significance of the
coefficients for the constant and the mobility variable
are even improved, while for the variable distance is
worsened and the standardised coefficients show a similar path to those of Fig. 3. Figure 5 also shows that this
evidence does not change substantially if we choose
a different mobility week. Indeed, the figure shows
that the R 2 evolution for each mobility week using the

is zoomed on Haut-Rhin. This cluster shows that the internal

model (3) on the selected data set (cut) of positive
excess deaths and mobility index present a common
pattern, i.e. mobility has no effect before the COVID19 outbreaks and has a fast decay after the lockdown
measures are in place (left and right tails of Fig. 5). On
the contrary, during the initial emergency phase, mobility is a key element of the spread of the virus and therefore on its outcome (the fatalities). Although we are not
trying to forecast the number of deaths with mobility
due to the extreme simplicity of the models considered, we notice that the R 2 path shows an observed
time lag between mobility and excess of deaths which
we impute to COVID-19: according to Li et al. [19]
the mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval 4.1–7.0), while according to Wang et al.
[24] the median number of days from the occurrence

of the first symptom to death is 14 (range 6–41) days.
See also Lauer et al. [18]. We now try to estimate this
lag looking at internal mobility.

3.1 Internal mobility matters the most
Most of the correlation captured by the R 2 in the previous analysis is due to the internal mobility within
the department and by the connectivity between the
Haut-Rhin department and few others (Bas-Rhin, Vosges, Aisne, but not, for example, Moselle, see also
Fig. 4). In fact, the distance alone cannot explain the
excess deaths in the chosen simplified (2) model. Starting from this evidence, which is common to most of
the departments considered in the analysis, we now

study the impact, if any, of internal mobility alone on
the excess deaths of the same department through a
time series approach. A similar study using domestic
air traffic data at country level can be found in Zhao
et al. [29]. In this work we consider the time series of
excess deaths and the one of the reductions of mobility
(100% = total lockdown, 0% no restriction to mobil-

ity) for each department through time. We normalise
the reduction of mobility index (namely nmob), to the

Figure 6 shows a plot of the two indicators for the
Haut-Rhin department. The graphs suggest an evident
lag could exist between the two curves. We can estimate
the statistical lag in the following way. Let θ ∈ (−δ, δ)
be the time lag between the two nonlinear time series
X and Y . Roughly speaking, the idea is to construct a
contrast function Un (θ ) = Cov(X t , Yt+θ ) which evaluates the Hayashi–Yoshida covariance estimator [9,10]

cumdeathsi − min j (cumdeathsi )
,
max j (cumdeathsi ) − min j (cumdeathsi )

Fig. 10 Data for log-mobility on 2 March 2020 and cumulative
excess deaths on 1 April 2020. Red represents the selected subset
of positive excess deaths and mobility. The other points are the
residual data. Red and light blue together represent the whole
data. The two curves correspond to the fitted model (2) for both
data sets. The R 2 for this fitted model is 0.91. The straight line

represent simple linear regression of the two variables in the plot.
The black vertical lines are on the dates of local lockdowns on 21
and 27 February 2020 and country-wise lockdown on 9 March
2020. The green lines are the same as the black lines, but shifted
by 14 days. (Color figure online)

linear regression among these two series gives a value
of R 2 of 0.96 (from 0.48 before shifting).

|Un (θ )|.

When the value of θ̂n is positive, it means that X t
and Yt+θ̂n (or X t−θ̂n and Yt ) are strongly correlated,

so we say ‘X leads Y by an amount of time θ̂n ’, so
X is the leader and Y is the lagger and vice versa for
negative θ̂n . The lead–lag estimator is provided by the
yuima R package [12]. Applying the lead–lag analysis to our data, we estimate a lag of 14 days which
is in line with the median lag time from the onset
of symptoms to death [18,24]. After shifting the normalised mobility curve by 14 days (lagnmob), the
cross-correlation between the curve lagnmob and the

3.2 Correlation network analysis
After analysing the internal mobility of the Haut-Rhin
department, we consider the internal mobility of each
department and estimate a lead–lag parameter against
the cumdeaths curves of all departments. This way
of proceedings takes into account possible spin-offs
from one department to another, but it is not a causal
inference analysis. After running the extensive 9216
(96 × 96) lead–lag analyses, we summarise the results
through a network analysis. Therefore, we build a
directed graph representing the lead–lag relationships

lag (days)

Fig. 12 Left panel: Correlation between cumdeaths and nmob at different lags. Right panel: cumdeaths, nmob with the additional
lagged normalised mobility curve lagnmob. The estimated optimal lag is 18 days

between the lagger cumulative deaths curves and the
leader internal mobility. The nodes in the graph from
Ai to B j are such that B j is the cumdeaths curve
for a target department j and Ai is the internal mobility of a department i. Cutting those edges that form
loops (internal mobility on the same department) and
further selecting the edges i → j which presents the
maximal lagged correlation for a given destination j,
we obtain a simplified graph. The edges on the graph
are weighted according to the R 2 statistics. On this
graph, a standard community detection algorithm for
directed graphs is run in order to discover similar paths
between mobility within a department and impact on

123

other departments. Keeping in mind that lead–lag analysis does not involve any causal effect, the clusters that
are obtained can be seen only as similar patterns of
lagged cross-correlation between internal mobility and
excess deaths in outbound departments. Most of the
lag discovered are around 14–20 days. Shorter lag estimates usually correspond to very flat excess cumulative
deaths curves. Too large lags (i.e. 30 days) are mostly
spurious correlation due to few observations. Figure 7
shows a graphical representation of the network graph.
(The full network is shown in Fig. 8.) It is important
to stress that no causality effect should be interpreted
from this correlation network graph. In fact, notice that

the reason why the department of Hautes-Alpes is the
origin of the edges of the graph towards many other
departments is because the mobility there was reduced
much earlier than in other departments, and therefore,
the correlation with the cumulative excess deaths is
much anticipated by simple covariation effects. So what
can be retained from this analysis? This network says
that dynamics of both mobility reduction and cumu-

lative excess deaths have similar patterns regardless of
the region. Therefore, this result, coupled with previous
analysis on internal mobility, can inform policy makers
on the expected spread containment in terms of human
mobility reduction and the corresponding lag needed
to achieve the flattening of the excess deaths curve.

4 Human mobility and COIVD-19 spread in Italy
In this section, we have replicated the study of Sect. 3
for Italy. Data on excess deaths are publicly available3
at Istat [15] at municipality level for 7270 municipalities (over a total of 7904, about 92%) for the period 1
January 2020–15 May 2020 (see Fig. 9). Mobility data
for Italy are coming from two different MNOs at different resolutions in space (census areas and NUTS3) and
time (hourly and daily). The use of both data sets allows
to capture short movements (less than the hour, mainly
internal mobility or across neighbour provinces) and
longer ones (more than 1 h) through connectivity matrices even when aggregated at NUTS3 level as considered in our analysis. One of the provinces strongly hit
by the virus initial spread in Italy is Bergamo. We will
use this case to show a parallel analysis to that of Sect. 3.
Figure 10 shows the scatterplot for the mobility week
of 2 March 2020 against the excess deaths on 1 April
2020. Under the mode model (3), the R 2 = 0.91 for
these two sets of data. Italy has put in place lockdowns
for the red zones (very small municipalities) on 21 and
27 February 2020, and the country-wise lockdown was
enforced on 9 March 2020, so it is interesting to see the
pattern of correlation 14–20 days after 9 March 2020
as marked with vertical lines in Fig. 11.
Figure 11 shows that this evidence does not change
substantially if we choose a different mobility week.
Indeed, the figure shows that the R 2 evolution for each
mobility week using the model (3) on the selected
data set (cut) of positive excess deaths and mobility index present a common pattern. In this particular
case, the R 2 reaches its maximum on 23 March 2020
with the value of 0.95. Now focusing on local mobil3

ity via lead–lag analysis, we discover a 18 days lag
between mobility reduction and the cumulative curve
of excess deaths (see Fig. 12). After shifting the normalised mobility curve by 18 days (lagnmob), the
cross-correlation between the curve lagnmob and the
curve cumdeaths raises from 0.76 to 0.99. A simple
linear regression among these two series gives a value
of R 2 of 0.99 (from 0.58 before shifting). The lead–lag
analysis shows that, over the 110 Italian provinces, the
lagged effect has a mean and median of 20 days, with
the first quantile being 16 and third quantile 25 days.
Figure 13 presents the correlation network graph for
the Italian provinces. In Sect. 3, correlation is not causation.

5 Human mobility and IgG antibody testing in
Spain
Another interesting case to test the impact of human
mobility on the virus spread is Spain. Indeed, despite
the fact that the number of cases is known only at region
(NUTS2) or country level, this country has conducted
a large-scale IgG SARS-Cov-2 antibody screening on
the population at province level in two waves on 27
April 2020 and 11 May 2020. The study, conducted by
ENE [4], has recruited 60,983 inland and an additional
3234 participants in the islands. As running examples,
we consider the provinces of Madrid and Barcelona, the
two provinces with highest number of cases in Spain,
and Badajoz (in Extremadura region) which is an average case. In our study, we combine the results of the
2 weeks of testing and we compare these data with the
mobility data using the same models of the previous

Badajoz (bottom right). The shape of the relationship is similar to the cases of France (Fig. 4) and Italy (Fig. 10)

parison with the number of positive IgG positive cases
by province. The combination of the left and middle
maps suggests the existence of a relationship between
mobility and positive cases that we will now try to quantify through correlation analysis. Figure 15 shows the
log–log plot of mobility versus IgG positive cases. The
pattern of the relationship between the two variables is
similar to what we observed for the excess deaths of
France (Fig. 4) and Italy (Fig. 10).

For Spain, though we do not have time series for
the IgG tests, we cannot run a lead–lad or correlation network analysis like in Sects. 3 and 4, but we
can only perform a simple correlation analysis, letting
the time of mobility to vary and keeping the IgG data
fixed. Figure 16 shows the behaviour of the Spearman
(traditional) and Pearson (rank) correlation coefficients
between the IgG positive tests and both the mobility and
distance between provinces on the linear scale. The evi-

Fig. 16 Values of the correlation coefficients for the provinces of
Madrid (top, maximum |ρ(Mob)| = 0.67), Barcelona (bottom
left, maximum |ρ(Mob)| = 0.56) and Badajoz (bottom right,
maximum |ρ(Mob)| = 0.41), between IgG positive tests and

both mobility and distance. The black vertical line corresponds
to the lockdown of 14 March 2020; the read line is just 14 days
later

dence here is that mobility is more important, in terms
of simple correlation, than the proximity between the
provinces up to lockdown which was enforced on Saturday 14 March 2020. The maximal value of the correlation coefficients for Madrid, Barcelona and Badajoz
are, respectively, 0.67, 0.56 and 0.56. On the other side,
Fig. 17 shows the goodness of fit measure R 2 for the (2)
model on the log–log scale. For Madrid and Barcelona,
R 2 = 0.57, while for Badajoz R 2 = 0.62.
Clearly, the correlations are less strong than those
of the excess deaths data because IgG data measure
a different aspect of the COVID-19 spread and, begin
essentially one point in space, is hard to estimate any
variation. Still, the results confirm that human mobility
have an impact on the virus spread.

6 Caveats of the study

123

It is important to remind that the choice to use a simple
model of Eq. (2) aims at showing the rough effect of
mobility on the initial spread of the virus. Clearly, such
a model is not intended to and should not be used to
produce any other type of result, like, for instance, to
forecast the number of deaths. In this work, the excess
deaths in France and Italy are treated only as a proxy
for the virus spread, as well as IgG testing for Spain
is a proxy for the number of people that have been in
contact with the virus at a given time.
It is also well known that the excess deaths actually due
to coronavirus are influenced by a long series of factors
such as the age structure of the population and its health

condition, the availability of ICU units and the preparedness of the healthcare system, and that these generally vary across regions. Moreover, part of the excess
deaths after lockdown events, may also be deflated by
the lower number of deaths due to, for example, road
accidents or work-related (many activities have been
shut down during national lockdowns). There is also
a technical issue due to the construction of the ODMs
where all movements below a given threshold are discarded in order to maintain data anonymity.
For obvious reasons (in primis for the lack of reliable
information), all these aspects have not been accounted
for by this study. In other words, despite some of the
confounding effects are captured by the constant coefficient of the basic models adopted, clearly there are
many other confounders that are not.

Yet, the fact that the results are quite stable and consistent across countries (also adopting different spatial
granularities), together with very similar findings published from different research teams relatively to China
[16], are absolutely encouraging for the evolution of
this research.

7 Discussion
This study demonstrates that human mobility, derived
by mobile data, is highly correlated with the spread
of COVID-19 in the initial phase of the outbreak. In
the case study of France, we have found that mobility
can explain from 52 up to 92% of the excess deaths
reasonably linked to the COVID-19 outbreak. In the

123

S. M. Iacus et al.

case study of Italy, we have found similar results (R 2
up to 0.91 and lagged effect of 14–20 days, depending
on the provinces), confirming that human mobility has
a high impact on the virus spread, at least before other
physical distancing measures are in place. In the case
of Spain, we have found that the number of people
resulting positive to IgG tests is highly correlated (ρ
up to 75%) with the human mobility.
The above case studies can provide solid evidence
to forecasting scenarios for future waves of the virus,
in cases where only limited additional protective measures are in place (e.g. wearing masks, physical distancing, etc.). This is achieved by exploring the linkage
between the geographical distribution of the excess of
mortality with respect to 2019 and fully anonymised
and aggregated mobile positioning data from European MNOs. Besides predicting dynamics of future
COVID-19 outbreaks, connectivity information can be
used as basis to plan targeted control measures to curb
the spread of the virus. Future data gathered in the context of this European Commission initiative with MNO
could enable an analysis at EU regional scale, providing
a framework for sharing best practices and data-driven
input to inform coherent strategy among EU Member
States for de-escalation and recovery.
