Abstract
We propose two stochastic models for the Coronavirus pandemic. The
statistical properties of the models, in particular the correlation functions
and the probability density function, have duly been computed. Our
models, which generalises a model previously proposed and published in a
specialised journal, take into account the adoption of the lockdown measures as well as the crucial role of the hospitals and Health Care Institutes.
To accomplish this work we have analysed two scenarios: the SIS-model
(Susceptible ⇒ Infectious ⇒ Susceptible) in presence of the lockdown
measures and the SIS-model integrated with the action of the hospitals
(always in presence of the lockdown measures). We show that in the case
of the pure SIS-model, once the lockdown measures are removed, the
Coronavirus will start growing again. However, in the second scenario,
beyond a certain threshold of the hospital capacities, the Coronavirus is
not only kept under control, but its capacity to spread tends to diminish
in time. Therefore, the combined effect of the lockdown measures with the
action of the hospitals and health Institutes is able to contain and dampen
the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. This result can be used during
a period of time when the massive distribution of delivery of a limited
number of vaccines in a given population is not yet feasible. By way of
example, we analysed the data for USA and France where the intensities
of the noise have been estimated by Statistical Mechanics. In particular,
for USA we have analysed two possible hypotheses: USA is still subject
to the first wave of infection by and USA is in the second (or third) wave
of SARS-CoV-2 infection.The agreement between theoretical predictions
and real data confirms the validity of our approach.
Key words: Mathematical model; COVID-19; Dynamics of population;

Introduction

The current number of infectious people by SARS-CoV-2 brought us back to the
lockdown phase, but the tracking and swabs give a clearer vision of the situation.
By reading the figures on new cases of positivity, it seems that we are returning
back to mid-April 2020. Hospitalisations are also growing up including new
hospitalisations in intensive care. In this respect, the situation appears deeply
different compared to the first months of the epidemic, when the prolonged
lockdown was necessary, which allowed to reduce the spread of the Coronavirus
significantly. The percentage ratio between new cases and swabs has now stood
at around 5% [1]. I is therefore far from almost 30 per cent of the ”darkest”
periods of the pandemic in certain European Countries. However, these data
induce to increase further preventive strategies, focusing on tracing and beyond,
taking into account that in some countries the ”weight” of the pandemic is
starting to be felt again on hospitals. So, we are in the middle of the second
wave, but the virus circulates among humans and therefore the lockdown period
has limited its spread, so much so that we have assisted to a sort of ”stagnation”
in the months of June and July for the subsequent resumption with August.
However, the virus did not changed or that the clinical manifestations that it
induces have not changed [?]. In this second period of COVID-19, we may trust
much more of statistical data thanks to the increased number of swabs done
and the tracing and monitoring of people who have contracted the SARS-CoV2 infection. Of course, there are still some cases, especially of asymptomatic
subjects who unfortunately can transmit the infection: about 20% of cases of
contagion would in fact be referred to subjects who do not show any health
problems. This situation also explains why the percentage of positive swabs
in the first weeks of the lockdown was around 30 percent while today it is
much lower. Anyway, we are still far from the figures, of several thousand,
of last March-April, but the trend is still on the rise. For this reason, it is
essential to contain the infections, also through ”ad hoc” measures (lockdown,
quarantine, isolation). The carelessness during the summer leave has created a
clear epidemiological link, given that the cases resumed in August and now we
have to remedy, also because there are signs coming from nearby France that
warn under this aspect.
• USA situation. After sustained declines in the number of COVID-19 cases
over recent months, restrictions are starting to ease across the United States.
Numbers of new cases are falling or stable at low numbers in some states, but
they are surging in many others. Overall, the USA. is experiencing a sharp
increase in the number of new cases a day, and by late June, had surpassed
the peak rate of spread in early April. In the USA, cases are rising quickly
right now. With more than 11 million confirmed cases, USA has the highest
number of infections in the world and the spread of the Coronavirus shows no
sign of slowing down. During the spring wave, swabs were mostly limited to
confirming cases in people who were already in hospital, meaning the true scale
of that outbreak wasn’t fully captured. But the latest data compiled by the
COVID Tracking Project shows the current surge is not just down to increased
2

testing, the number of tests carried out in USA was up by 12.5% week on week,
while the number of cases increased by more than 40% [3]. One likely cause
is the change of season and colder weather driving people indoors to socialise,
where the risk of spread is heightened due to less social distancing and poor
ventilation. The strain on hospitals is growing. Because of the change in the
level of testing, a better way to compare waves is to look at the number of people
being admitted to hospital because of Covid-19. This data shows that roughly
the same number of people across the USA were in hospital during the first and
second waves of the outbreak. But there are already more people in hospital
during the current wave - more than 70000 at the moment. New deaths per day
have not begun to climb, but some hospitals’ intensive care units have recently
reached full capacity [4]. This wave is hitting every USA region. We can say
that the USA as a whole is not in a second wave because the first wave never
really stopped. The virus is simply spreading into new populations or resurgent
in places that let down their guard too soon. This time around, every region is
seeing a spike in new cases [3].
• France situation. Coronavirus cases in France rose dramatically, but the number of daily deaths declined. The total number of infections stands at around
of 1829659, with the death toll standing at 42207, according to the Ministry
of Health. The overall downward trend is a positive sign after Coronavirus
numbers increased drastically by reaching a peak of 86852 cases. Some 99 departments throughout France remain in a vulnerable position with 3042 clusters
of infection considered serious [5]. France now has the fourth highest number of
infections in the world behind the USA, India and Brazil. Despite the French
government’s efforts to slow down the spread of the virus with targeted measures such as lockdown and isolation, the rate of infections has continued to
rise across the Country. Talk of a second wave, and how to avoid it, has been
around since the end of the spring lockdown, but the current situation seems to
suggest it was inevitable. One month after instituting the lockdown measures
were applied in major cities starting from Paris and three weeks after extending
it to almost the whole Country, France sees the light at the end of the dark tunnel of the second wave of Coronavirus. French Health Minister announced that
he believes that the peak of the pandemic has passed, and the control has been
regained. Indeed, looking at the data, after the peak of 86000 cases recorded
on 7 November, the Country has moved on figures of around 30000 daily infections with a minimum level of 230000 recorded on 13 November. Figures
that are returning in line with those of a month ago when the lockdown began
[6]. However, the Country will remain in a second nationwide lockdown that
will continue until Dec. 1 unless the number of infections and deaths decrease
significantly.
• Modelling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Until vaccine arrives, the
tried-and-true public health measures of the last months (social distancing,
universal mask wearing, frequent hand-washing and avoiding crowded indoor
spaces) are the ways to stop the first wave and thwart a second one. And when
there are surges like what is happening now in the word, further reopening plans
need to be put on hold. Meanwhile, in order to understand the situation, the3

oretic studies, mainly based on mathematical model with the use of up-to-date
data, must be carried in order to understand the spread of this pandemic in
future and provide predictions. In this study we propose a simple stochastic
model with the objective to show how public health interventions can influence
the outcome of the epidemic, by limiting and even damping the spread of the
SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, waiting for the production and delivering of an effective
vaccine. The analysis is carried by assigning population in different compartments with labels, such as S, I, R and D (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered,
and Deaths). People can progress between the compartments. The order of
the labels shows the flow patterns between the compartments; for example SIS
means susceptible, infectious and, therefore, Susceptible again. The origin of
these models is at the beginning of the twentieth century [7]. The goal of our
model is to predict how a disease spreads, or the dynamics of the number of
infectious people, and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dynamics
of this kind of models is governed by ordinary differential equations (O.D.E.s).
Generally, these O.D.E.s are deterministic, but in this work the dynamics is
described by a stochastic differential equation, which is more realistic.
The work is organised as follows. In Section (2), we study the deterministic SISmodel in presence of the lockdown measures. We shall see that as soon as the
lockdown measures are stopped, the spread of the Coronavirus begins to grow
back vigorously once a certain threshold is exceeded. In the Subsection (1.2) we
ask ourselves the following question: Let us suppose that a government needs a
number x of weeks (e.g. 6 weeks) before being able to deliver an effective vaccine. What is the minimum value of infectious people that should be expected,
after the adoption of severe lockdown measures imposed on the population, to be
sure that after x-weeks (e.g. after 6 weeks) the total number of the infectious
individuals by Coronavirus remains below a threshold pre-set in advance, and
acceptable from a medical and political point of view ?. Subsection (2.1) answers the above-mentioned question for the SIS-model subject to the lockdown
measures. In Section (3) we introduce, and study, the Stochastic SIS-model
subject to the lockdown measures (the (SIS)L -model). We compute the relevant correlation functions as well as the probability density function. Hospitals
and health institutions play a crucial role in hindering the spread of the Coronavirus. In Section (4), we propose a model that accounts for people who are
only traced back to hospitalised infectious individuals. This model is referred
to as the (SISIh rh dh )L -model. We shall see that beyond a certain threshold
of the hospital capacities, the coronavirus not only is kept under control, but
its spread even tends to diminish in time. Therefore, the combined effect of
the lockdown measures with efficient Hospitals and health Institutes is able to
contain and dampen the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, waiting for the
delivery of a limited number of vaccines in a given population. In Section (5),
we study the simplified (SISIh )L stochastic model by computing the relevant
correlation functions. Comparison between the theoretical predictions and the
real data for USA and France can be found in Section (6). Concluding remarks
are reported in Section (7). An estimation of the intensity of the noise by Statistical Mechanics can be found in Annex 1. The derivation of the exact solution of
4

Richards equation is reported in Appendix 2. Tables of real data for infectious
individuals in USA and France are shown in Annex 3.

The Deterministic Model in Presence of the
Lockdown Measures - The (SIS)L -Model

According to ref. [8], Respiratory viruses remain quiet for months, inactive but
viable, within living cells. Then suddenly they activate and become virulent as
they say, the infectious capacity grows to a maximum, after which it decreases.
So, there is no valid reason to think that this Coronavirus behaves differently
from others infections by SARS. [8]. The present work starts from the following
hypothesis: the SARS-CoV-2 behaves like the other viruses that cause respiratory diseases. The common cold and influenza, do not confer any long-lasting
immunity. Such infections do not give immunity upon recovery from infection,
and individuals become susceptible again. Hence, according to the above-cited
hypothesis we propose the following simplest compartmental model:
σ

S+I −
→ 2I

(1)

In our model the SARS-CoV-2 infection does not leave any immunity, thus
individuals return back into the S compartment. Hence, infectious people, after
recovery, return back to the compartmental S. This added detail can be shown
by including an R class in the middle of the model
σ

S+I −

where α̃ and K denote the linear growing rate of the COVID-19 and the carrying

into account by introducing in the SIS-model the lockdown-induced decrease

to the condition c(t̂) > 0 for t̂ > 1, respectively. Notice that expression (12)
satisfies condition (10) and is able to dampen the growing trend of the number
of infectious. We are looking for an expression for the lockdown, which grows
at most linearly in time. So, the relevant terms in expression (12) are

The Second Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the
(SIS)L -model

The basic reproduction number, R0 , is defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced by a single (typical) infection in a completely susceptible
population. An epidemic occurs if the number of infected individuals increases,
i.e., dI/dt > 0
S

or

γ NT ot.
In this case, R0 = σ/γ. When the lockdown measures are interrupted, the
dynamics of the process are governed again by Eq. (8). For Italy, in the first
wave we had R0 > 1, so K > 0. From Eq. (8) we get
σ
>1
γ

hence

α>0

and

lim I = K

(20)

t̂→∞

The above relations biologically mean that the disease will remain permanently
endemic in the population. Notice that the inflection point of the logistic
curve (8) occurs at time t = tf with


1
K
t̂f = log
−1
(21)
α
IL
with IL denoting the number of the infectious people when the lockdown measures start to be applied. It is easily checked that the inflection point, Pf , has
8

coordinates Pf = (t̂f , If = K/2). In our forthcoming reasoning, we shall see
that the inflection point plays an important role in our analysis. To summarize, after removing the lockdown measurements, say at time t̂1 , the number
of infectious people will start to rise again from the value I1 , with I1 ≡ It=t̂1 ,
following again a growth rate given by the logistic curve (8). This new growth
of outbreak is referred to as the second wave of COVID-19. Now, our goal is
to answer the following question: ”Given a fixed value of the infectious people,
˜ determine the minimum value that I1 should have so that the number
say I,
ˆ during the entire period from t̂1 to t̂f ”. We
of infectious people is less than I,
note that within the interval t̂1 ≤ t̂ ≤ t̂f the number of infectious people grows
quite slowly. Let us indicate with t̂2 the time when it is decided to interrupt the
lockdown measures. Hence, during the time interval ∆t̂ = t̂2 − t̂1 , population
is no longer subject to the lockdown measures. To answer the above-mentioned
question we need firstly to find the range of values that can be assumed by I1
so that in the interval ∆t̂ < t̂f − t̂1 , the number of infectious individuals is lower
than the ordinate of the inflection point, i.e. I1 < If = K/2 for t̂ ∈ ∆t̂. It is
easily checked that I1 should be within the range
0 ≤ I1 <

K
1 + exp(α∆t̂)

(22)

Now, we have to require that after a lapse of time ∆t̂, the number of the infectious individuals must be lower than a value I˜ fixed a priori, with I˜ < K/2.
The result is easily obtained by writing the initial condition as
I1 =

K
− Kx
1 + exp(α∆t̂)

with

0<x≤

1
1 + exp(α∆t̂)

(23)

and by determining the range of values of x such that the inequality
K
K
≤ I˜ <
2
1 + (K/I1 − 1) exp(−α∆t̂)

(24)

is satisfied. After a little algebra, we get
0 ≤ I1 ≤ I˜

2 + exp α∆t̂ + exp(−α∆t̂)
(25)
˜
(1 + exp(α∆t̂)(I/K(exp(α∆t̂) + exp(−α∆t̂) + 1 + exp(α∆t̂))

To summarise, if the lockdown measures are interrupted at the time t̂1 , during
the successive period of time ∆t̂ = t̂2 − t̂1 the number of infectious remains
inferior to a preset number I˜ if the number of the infectious at the end of the
lockdown measures is inferior to I1 , with I1 given by the r.h.s. of Eq. (25). A
Schematic representation of the second wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection is shown
in Fig. 2.
As an example, let us consider the case of the Italian situation. Fig. 3. reports
I1 against I˜ and ∆t̂ in the range 50000 ≤ I˜ ≤ KIT . As shown in Fig. 4., if we
set the value of I˜ = 50000, the maximum value of I1 is I1 ' 9500 for t ' tL ,
and I1 ' 700 for t ' 2tL , respectively.

Figure 2: Schematic representation of the second wave of SARS-CoV2 infection. The Lockdown measures are applied during the period t̂0 − t̂1 . At
the end of the confinement measures, the number of infectious dropped to I1 .
During the time interval ∆t̂ = t̂2 − t̂1 , the lockdown measures are not applied and
the infection by SARS-CoV-2 (starts growing again (second wave of Coronavirus
infection) until the preset value I˜ is reached, which corresponds to I(t̂2 ). During
the whole time interval ∆t̂, the number of infectious individuals still stay below
a set threshold I˜ if I1 satisfies condition (25).

To get the PDF, we proceed as follows. First, we simulate paths or realisations of Eq. (26) with the indicated parameters. The employed algorithm is
an Order-2 Stochastic Runge-Kutta like scheme. Regarding the discretisation
in the numerical solution of the Langevin Eq. (26) we use 500 time steps to
build each stochastic path. The PDF is computed numerically by constructing
an histogram at each instant of time with a sufficiently number of realisations.
The standard number used here is 22000 paths. The values of the parameters
are α = 1.5, β = 0.1, respectively, and for the PDF algorithm we use 800 bins
in the construction of the corresponding histograms at the indicated times. The

The (SISIh rh dh )L -Model

As seen, according to the SIS-model, after the lockdown measures the number
of infectious people starts to increase again. Hospitals and health institutions
play a crucial role in hindering the spread of the Coronavirus. In this Section,
we propose a model that accounts for people who are only traced back to hospitalised infectious individuals. However, we anticipate that the model for the
hospitalised people should be considered as an purely idealistic, rather than a

to the same existing lockdown measures as any other people.. Of course, we

hospitalised. In our case, the enzyme is compared to the available hospital beds, the substrate
to the infected people, and the product to the recovered people, respectively. Of course, the
reverse MM reaction has no sense in our case and, consequently, the kinetic constant is equal
to zero.

account the current Belgian hospital-protocol: ”Only the seriously sick people
are hospitalised, the remaining infectious individuals have to be sent home and
they must be subject to quarantine measures”. Hence, I  Ih and the total
number of recovered people, R, is much larger than the total number of the recovered people, previously hospitalised (i.e. R  rh ). Under these assumptions,

If the threshold of the hospital capacities exceeds a minimum limit, the spread of
the Coronavirus tends to decrease over time, and the stable solution corresponds
to zero infectious individuals.

However, this is a quite long and tedious procedure. We may circumvent the
obstacle by recalling that, as we did in Section (3), it is possible to obtain such
correlation functions in a direct way, by using the theorem (30-31). For this,
we have to determine the dynamic O.D.E.s for the fluctuations δI(t̂) and δIh (t̂)

The value of Ch (the total Italian hospitals’ capacity) may be obtained by
making reference to the data published in [22]. More specifically, in 2017, when
there were 518 public hospitals and 482 accredited private ones, in Italy there
were 151646 beds for ordinary hospitalisation in public hospitals (2.5 per 1000
21

inhabitants) and 40458 in private ones (0.7 per 1000 inhabitants), for a total of
over 192 thousand beds (3.2 per 1000 inhabitants).
The number of public and private beds destined for intensive care was 5.090 (a
number very close to the 5100 cited by the newspapers these days), about 8.42
per 100000 inhabitants [22].
Fig. 18. shows the correlation function < δIh (t)δIh (t) >, solution of the second
O.D.E. of system (59). As se can see, this is a typical correlation function
that random fluctuations at equilibrium look like. This is not surprising as
our reference state correspond to the maximum capacity of the hospitals (i.e.
IhRS = Ch ) so, fluctuations at equilibrium are the only possible ones. The three
correlation functions < δI(t)δI(t) >, < δIh (t)δIh (t) >, and < δI(t)δIh (t) >,
solution of the system (59), are reported in Fig. 19.

show, France is currently subject to the second wave of Coronavirus while the
USA data may induce to think that they are in full second (or third) wave.
However, looking at the behaviour of infectious curve we may also argue that,
in agreement with ref. [27], USA as a whole is not in a second (or third) wave
because the first wave never really stopped. The virus is simply spreading into
new populations or resurgent in places that let down their guard too soon. So,
we are interested in analysing both of these scenarios.
Fig. 22. and Fig. 23. show the comparison between the theoretical predictions
(blue line) and real data (black dots) for USA. Fig. 22. refers to the hypothesis
that US is still in the first wave of Coronavirus, whereas Fig. 23. has been
obtained by assuming that US population is currently subject to the third wave
of Coronavirus, respectively. Fig. 24. and Fig. 25. show the comparison between
the theoretical predictions (blue line) and real data (black dots) for France. The
values of the parameters for both cases, USA and France, are reported in the
figure captions.

Now, let us deal with the stochastic processes. Fig. 26. and Fig. 27. illustrate
the comparison between the theoretical predictions (blue lines) and real data
(black dots) for France concerning the first and the second waves of SARS-CoV2, respectively. The intensity of the noise has been estimated by using Eq. (63).
As we can see, the predictions of our model are in a fairly good agreement with
real data.
As for US, we have analised two possible hypotheses:
1) USA is still subject to the first wave of Coronavirus infection;
2) USA is in the second or third wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Figs. 28. and 29. illustrate these two scenarios. More specifically, Fig. 28. refers
to scenario 1). In order to obtain the best possible agreement with real data,
we have increased, arbitrarily, the intensity of the noise up to a value that is 45
times higher than that estimated by Eq. (63) (we set η̃ = 0.009). However, we
did not reach this objective is a satisfactory way.
Fig. 29. refers to scenario 2). In this case the intensity of the noise corresponds
to the value estimated by Eq. (63) (we have η̃ = 0.0002). Here, we get a
fairly good agreement with real data. Finally, our results lead to two possible
interpretations:
a) USA is experiencing a second (or even third) wave of Coronavirus infection;
b) USA is still subject to the first wave of infection. However, given the heterogeneity and vastness of the territory, the variables of the system (i.e. S, I,
R, and D) must depend on time as well as on space. In this case, the correct
equations governing the evolution of the compartments must be of Stochastic
Partial Differential Equations (S.P.D.E.s)-type.
In our opinion, scenario b) is the correct interpretation.

Conclusions

Waiting for the mass production of the vaccine, we studied two scenarios by
means of two mathematical models: the (SIS)L -model and the (SISIh rh dh )L model.
The first scenario, described by the (SIS)L -model, refers to the situation in
which the role of Hospitals is not taken into account. The second model (the
(SISIh rh dh )L -model) integrates the contribution provided by the Hospitals and
Health Care Institutes. The dynamics are governed by stochastic differential
equations, which are suitable for describing realistic situations. We compute
the relevant correlation functions as well as the probability density functions.
In the SIS L model, we determined the minimum value of infectious individuals
that must be reached after the lockdown measures so that, once these measures
are removed, during the time interval ∆t̂, the number of infectious still stay
below a set threshold.
The (SISIh rh dh )L -model shows the crucial role played by the Hospitals. More
specifically, we showed that the Health Care Institutions can influence the outcome of the outbreak, limiting, and even dampening, the spread of the Coronavirus. By way of example, we dealt with the cases of the United States and

France. The comparison between the theoretical predictions with real data confirmed the validity of our models. In particular, for US, we have examined two
possible scenarios: USA is still subject to the first wave of infection by Coronavirus and USA is in the second (or third) wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We
concluded that, for a so vast and heterogeneous Country, spatial dependance
of the variables can no longer be ignored and the correct equations governing the evolution of the different compartments, S, I, R, and D, should be of
S.P.D.E.s-type.

APPENDIX 1: A Rough Estimate of the Intensity of the Noise

The intensity of the noise for the entire process may be estimated by adopting the concept of Grand Ensemble in statistical mechanics. More specifically,
we may establish the following correspondences: Quantity of SARS-CoV-2 corresponds to the Energy of the system, the Quantity of SARS-CoV-2 that can

the Chemical Potential (µch. ), and the Surface of a Country corresponds to
the Volume of the system, respectively. Temperature of a system (T) is mimicked by the surrounding environment, which is more or less favourable to the
spread of Coronavirus depending on whether particular prevention measures are
adopted (e.g. use of masks, maintaining a safe distance, tracking of the infection, adoption of lockdown, quarantine and isolation measures, etc.). Hence, in
this scenario:
i) Temperature equilibrium (”TCountry = TEnv. ”) stands for Environment equilibrium;
ch.
ii) Identical chemical potentials (µch.
Country = µEnv. ) stands for equal variation
of the quantity of Coronavirus with respect to a change of the Infectious people;
iii) Of course the Surface of a Country (corresponding to the Volume of the
system) is kept constant;
iv) The total number of Infectious individuals (corresponding to the ”number
of particles”) and the quantity of the SARS-CoV-2 in a Country (corresponding
to the ”Energy of the system”) are not fixed.
Under the above conditions, we may consider that the system is governed by
the Grand Ensemble statistical mechanics. So, according to this statistics, the
−1/2
relative fluctuations of the number of the infectious people behaves as KCountry
[28], with KCountry denoting the capacity of the Country’s population. It is
easily checked that this implies that the intensity of the noise in Eq. (26) is of
