Abstract
The relationship between a pandemic and the concurrent economy is quite comparable to the
relation observed among health and wealth in general. Since March 25, 2020, India had been
under a nation-wide lockdown announced as a response to the spread of SARS-Cov-2 and
COVID-19 and has resorted to a process of ‘unlocking’ the lockdown over the past couple of
months. This work attempts to examine the effect of novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and
its resulting disease, the COVID-19, on the foreign exchange rates and stock market
performances of India using secondary data over a span of 112 days spanning between March
11 and June 30, 2020.
The study explores whether the causal relationships and directions among the growth rate of
confirmed cases (GROWTHC), exchange rate (GEX) and SENSEX value (GSENSEX) are
remaining the same across different pre and post-lockdown phases, attempting to capture any
potential changes over time via the vector autoregressive (VAR) models. A positive correlation
is found between the growth rate of confirmed cases and the growth rate of exchange rate, and
a negative correlation between the growth rate of confirmed cases and the growth rate of
SENSEX value.
A naïve interpretation from this could be that with the rising growth rate of the number of
confirmed cases, the economy took a toll, reflected by the Indian currency being depreciated
while the stock exchange index suffered from a fall. However, on applying a VAR model, it is
observed that an increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases causes no significant change in
the values of the exchange rate and SENSEX index. The result varies if the analysis is split
across different time periods – before lockdown, the four phases of lockdown, and the first
phase of unlock.
To compare these periods, we had undertaken eight rounds of analyses. Nuanced and sensible
interpretations of the numeric results indicate significant variability across time in terms of the
relation between the variables of interest. This detailed knowledge about the varying patterns
of dependence could potentially help the policy makers and investors of India in order to
develop their strategies to cope up with the situation.

Introduction
A 55-year-old individual from the Hubei province in China was reported to have been the first
person to have contracted what is now called COVID-19, [Bryner, 2020] the disease caused by
the novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2). [Huang et al., 2020] In India, the first case was reported
on the 30th of January 2020 in Kerala. [“COVID-19 India”, 2020] Till March 24, 2020, a total
of 657 COVID-19 cases were reported among which 11 were deceased and the number of
recovered cases was 6. [“COVID-19 India”, 2020] Since March 25, India had been under
national lockdown, which extended till the end of May over four different phases. [Murukesh,
2020] The beginning of June saw India attempting to come out of the lockdown via what was
christened ‘unlock’, a procedure that is currently at its third cycle as of August 14. [Murukesh,
2020]
One of the controlling factors of any disease scenario – quality of healthy life, which includes
purified water, sanitized housing, sufficient nutritious food, good health care etc., is also an
essential contributor to any economy, but the affordability of the same depends on both
financial stability and access to required knowledge to enhance and maintain one’s health. [Fan
et al., 2018] [Farhud, 2015] [Frakt, 2018] Thus, the relationship between a pandemic and the
concurrent economy has been observed to be exactly similar to the relation observed among
health and wealth in general. [Bloom and Canning, 2020] [Mckee and Stuckler, 2020] [Ojong,
2020] The pandemic can hamper economic developments and trigger catastrophic events,
thereby reducing the wealth of health and reducing protection against further health threats.
[Bloom and Canning, 2020]
A past work on the economic impact of a pandemic observed that education, health and social
service, and insurance sectors suffered from a large amount of loss to GDP in UK, France,
Belgium and the Netherlands due to the effects of influenza outbreaks. [Keogh-Brown et al.,
2010] According to conjectures and calculations provided by the rating agency S&P, COVID19 can slow down the growth rate of baseline GDP for the world by 0.3 percentage point (ppt),
for China by 0.7 ppt; for Asia-Pacific by 0.5 ppt; and for the USA and Europe by 0.1 to 0.2
ppt. [Bloom and Canning, 2020] Another study using data from Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange
(KLSE) and exchange rate of the currency of Malaysia (MYR) found a significant effect on
equity market and on exchange rate and mentioned that the outbreak of COVID-19 is creating
an insecure feeling to investors in equity market. [Bakar & Rosbi, 2020] A study on the effect
of COVID-19 on financial volatility index (VIX) concluded that the spread of coronavirus is
increasing the financial volatility. [Albulescu, 2020] Another study to see the short-run effect
of COVID-19 on the 21 leading stock markets in the world observed a sharp decline in the
stock markets since the virus outbreak. [Liu et al., 2020]
In any economy, both the supply and the demand are affected by the pandemic which may
result in a persistent and large economic catastrophe all over the world. [Eichenbaum et al.,
2020] However, according to McKenzie, there is no substantial relationship between Foreign
Exchange volatility and international trade. [McKenzie, 1999] Vaguely, this means that at a
standard scenario, the fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate do not affect the international
trade. Bahmani-Oskooee and Saha investigated the potential link between exchange rate and
stock prices using timeseries data of 24 countries and found that there may be a short-run
relationship between these two variables, but the relationship doesn’t hold in a longer term.
[Bahmani-Oskooee & Saha, 2018] The short-term shocks due to a pandemic can be improved
in an economy by identifying and funding productive projects with better investment
opportunities which is impelled by a well-governed stock market. [Nazir et al., 2010] It has

3

also been observed that changes in monetary policy has surprisingly variable impacts across
different sectors. [Prabu et al., 2020]
In context of India, a disease outbreak and its impacts on the national economy is not a
completely new experience. In 1918, “The Bombay Influenza” was spread from seven police
sepoys in Bombay to Uttar Pradesh and Punjab through railway services by two weeks, which
appeared to cause the highest number of deaths in one nation, the estimated number being 1020 million. [Acharjee, 2020] During the Spanish flu, India experienced the lowest GDP growth
rate (-10.5%) forever and an all-time high level of inflation, with a resulting supply side shock.
The situation was worse compared to the first world war and the Bengal famine, as corroborated
by future investigators. [Sreevatsan, 2020] Unsurprisingly enough, COVID-19 too presents a
challenge before the Indian economy which can turn both ways. IMF predicted that the growth
rate of GDP in India can be more than 7% in April 2021 if the nation can control the coronavirus
outbreak, but the growth rate could come down to as low as 1.9% in March 2021, depending
on the control of the disease and stimulating monetary and fiscal policies immediately ending
up the lockdowns. [Choudhury, 2020]
The stock market acts as an important ingredient of an open-market economy. In this study, we
consider SENSEX value to analyse the market performance of India’s stock market because
since 1989 when it had been set up, it has become the basic representative of the Bombay Stock
Exchange (BSE) and has been considered as the ‘barometer’ of Indian economy. Instability of
market condition results in volatility of the stock market, and the price of BSE Sensex and
stock of major companies on BSE prices have previously been reported to be positively related.
[Challa et al., 2018] Internationally, behaviour of experienced and smart investors has been
indicated to lead to a high return. [Kaufman, 1995] Recent studies have found the market as a
respondent of the potential economic outcome under the pandemic, COVID-19. [Ramelli &
Wagner, 2020] Large price movements took place over the past few months because the
investors started to exhibit concerns regarding the COVID-19 shock via financial ways.
[Abdelnour, 2020]
This study explores the impact of COVID-19 on the stock market of India and attempts to
explore their relationship using Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models. [Pfaff et al., 2008] The
VAR model is treated as a standard tool in determining inter-dependencies and dynamic
relationships among the variables in time-series econometrics. These models are able to explain
the endogenous variables solely based on their historical values, apart from the deterministic
regressors. We also aim to find out whether the fluctuations in international trade of India,
caused by the pandemic, is reflected in the foreign exchange rate of the country. With new
incoming data, the dependence between the economic indicators and the spread of the
pandemic can be tracked more accurately, which in turn can help guide policymaking to absorb
the potential diminishing effects of COVID-19.
Methods
Secondary data were collected for the number of infected cases from COVID-19, the stock
market value and exchange rate from different sources. We have divided our work into eight
Rounds considering the following eight time periods based on the decisions of government and
WHO.

h. March 11 to June 30: 112 days (Pre-lockdown to Unlock 1.0).
On 11th March, WHO upgraded the status of COVID-19 to Pandemic from Epidemic and on
that day the first death in India due to coronavirus was reported. Rounds a-e are considered to
identify the relations between COVID-19 on stock market and exchange rate of India
exclusively for the individual phases of lockdown and unlock. Round f serves the purpose of a
holistic view over the lockdown and unlock periods combined to check whether the observed
patterns in the individual rounds hold for long. Round g offers the utility of taking a closer look
at the dependence between the pandemic and the economic indicators at the initial, more
moderate stage of the pandemic. Finally, round h is considered for 112 days to summarize the
changing patterns over the whole course of the pandemic in India till the end of June.
In our analysis we use closing value of the stock market, which is significant and is a standard
quantification of the market for several reasons. Investors, traders, financial institutions,
regulators and other stakeholders use it as a reference point for determining performance over
a specific time such as one year, a week and over a shorter time frame such as one minute or
less. In fact, investors and other stakeholders base their decisions on closing stock prices. [Ellul
et al., 2005] We denote the growth rates for confirmed cases, SENSEX and exchange rate as
GROWTHC, GSENSEX and GEX throughout this paper. For each combination of the
response and explanatory variables, we first use multiple linear regression models and then
vector autoregressive (VAR) models to identify the patterns of interdependence and
correlation. As diagnostic measures, we check the stationarity of the variables considered using
unit root test and check the robustness of the VAR model fits using serial correlation test and
lag order selection criteria. The results from the robustness checks are summarized in
Supplementary Materials Section S5.
Results
Round a: Lockdown 1.0 (March 25 – April 14)
During this round, the nation was experiencing its first phase of complete lockdown due to
COVID-19. The movement of the three growth rates over time for this period is summarized
in Figures 1a-1c (red lines). The three variables were checked to be stationary by using unit
root test (Supplementary Materials Subsection S1.1). Regression result of GEX as dependent
variable on GROWTHC and GSENSEX as covariates indicates the overall model to be
significant at 5% level, with the GROWTHC coefficient having a p-value of 0.08
(Supplementary Materials Subsubsection S2.1.3 and Figure 1c). One-point increase in
GSENSEX causes GEX to fall by 0.058 point and the same in GROWTHC causes GEX to rise
by 0.023 point (Supplementary Materials Subsubsection S2.1.3). In this period, the correlation
matrix exhibits a positive correlation (0.45) between GROWTHC and GEX, but a negative
correlation (-0.23) between GROWTHC and GSENSEX (Supplementary Materials Subsection
S3.1). This meant that with the rise in the growth rate of the number of confirmed cases, the
Indian currency continued depreciating, whereas the stock exchange index started to fall. Also,
there is a notable negative correlation (-0.40) between GSENSEX and GEX. On applying
VAR, we do find a significant dependence between GSENSEX and the one-period lagged
difference in GROWTHC, evident by the computed t-statistic (2.16) (Supplementary Materials
Subsection 4.1). Looking at the IRF graphs (Figures 1d-e), it can be seen that during this round,
due to the COVID-19 shock, GSENSEX and GEX would have taken about 5.5 periods (days)
to return to their long-run growth trend.
Round b: Lockdown 2.0 (April 15 – May 03)
5

During this round, the nation was experiencing the second extended phase of complete
lockdown due to COVID-19. The movement of the three growth rates over time for this period
is summarized in Figures 2a-2c (red lines). The three variables were checked to be stationary
by using unit root test (Supplementary Materials Subsection S1.2). Regression result of GEX
as dependent variable on GROWTHC and GSENSEX as covariates indicates the overall model
to be significant at 5% level, with the GSENSEX coefficient having a p-value less than 0.01
(Supplementary Materials Subsubsection S2.2.3 and Figure 2c). One-point increase in
GSENSEX causes GEX to fall by 0.213 point and the same in GROWTHC causes GEX to rise
by 0.003 point (Supplementary Materials Subsubsection S2.2.3). In this period, the correlation
matrix exhibits a weaker positive correlation (0.24) between GROWTHC and GEX compared
to the same from the previous round, but a stronger negative correlation (-0.29) than before
between GROWTHC and GSENSEX (Supplementary Materials Subsection S3.2). This meant
that with the rise in the growth rate of the number of confirmed cases, the Indian currency still
continued depreciating, whereas the stock exchange index started to fall. Also, there is a
notably strong negative correlation (-0.79) between GSENSEX and GEX. On applying VAR,
we find no significant dependence between the growth rates (Supplementary Materials
Subsection 4.2). Looking at the IRF graphs (Figures 2d-e), it can be seen that during this round,
due to the COVID-19 shock, GSENSEX and GEX would have taken about 6 and 8 periods
(days) respectively to return to their long-run growth trend, indicating a larger shock.
Round c: Lockdown 3.0 (May 04 – May 17)
During this round, the nation was experiencing its third extended phase of complete lockdown
due to COVID-19. The movement of the three growth rates over time for this period is
summarized in Figures 3a-3c (red lines). The three variables were checked to be stationary by
using unit root test (Supplementary Materials Subsection S1.3). All the multiple linear
regression models turn out to be non-significant at an overall 5% level. Regression result of
GSENSEX as dependent variable on GROWTHC and GEX as covariates shows that ne-point
increase in GEX causes GSENSEX to fall by 0.284 point and the same in GROWTHC causes
GSENSEX to fall by 0.858 point (Supplementary Materials Subsubsection S2.3.2). In this
period, the correlation matrix exhibits a positive correlation (0.46) between GROWTHC and
GEX, but a negative correlation (-0.59) between GROWTHC and GSENSEX (Supplementary
Materials Subsection S3.3). This meant that with the rise in the growth rate of the number of
confirmed cases, the Indian currency continued depreciating, whereas the stock exchange index
started to fall. Also, there is a notable negative correlation (-0.33) between GSENSEX and
GEX. Looking at the IRF graphs from the VAR models (Figures 3d-e), it can be seen that
during this round, due to the COVID-19 shock, GSENSEX and GEX would have taken about
10 periods (days) to return to their long-run growth trend.
Round d: Lockdown 4.0 (May 18 – May 31)
During this round, the nation was experiencing the fourth extended phase of complete
lockdown due to COVID-19. The movement of the three growth rates over time for this period
is summarized in Figures 4a-4c (red lines). The three variables were checked to be stationary
by using unit root test (Supplementary Materials Subsection S1.4). All the multiple linear
regression models turn out to be non-significant at an overall 5% level. Regression result of
GEX as dependent variable on GROWTHC and GSENSEX as covariates indicates the overall
model to be significant at 10% level, with the GROWTHC coefficient having a p-value of 0.06
(Supplementary Materials Subsubsection S2.4.3 and Figure 4c). One-point increase in
GSENSEX causes GEX to rise by 0.062 point and the same in GROWTHC causes GEX to rise
by 0.029 point (Supplementary Materials Subsubsection S2.4.3). In this period, the correlation
matrix exhibits a positive correlation (0.50) between GROWTHC and GEX, and a very small
6

positive correlation (<0.01) between GROWTHC and GSENSEX (Supplementary Materials
Subsection S3.4). This meant that with the rise in the growth rate of the number of confirmed
cases, the Indian currency continued depreciating, whereas the stock exchange index
experienced a very small upward effect. Also, the correlation between GSENSEX and GEX
surprisingly becomes positive (0.32). Looking at the IRF graphs from the VAR model (Figures
4d-e), it can be seen that during this round, due to the COVID-19 shock, GSENSEX and GEX
would have taken about 5 and 6 periods (days) respectively to return to their long-run growth
trend.
Round e: Unlock 1.0 (June 01 – June 30)
During this round, the nation was experiencing its first phase of unlock procedure. The
movement of GSENSEX over time for this period is summarized in Figure 5a (red line). The
three variables were checked for stationarity, and only GSENSEX and GEX turned out to be
stationary by using unit root test (Supplementary Materials Subsection S1.5). Regression result
of GSENSEX as dependent variable on GEX indicates the overall model to be non-significant
at 5% level, with the GEX coefficient having a p-value greater than 0.10 (Supplementary
Materials Subsubsection S2.5.1 and Figure 5a). One-point increase in GEX causes GSENSEX
to fall by 1.39 points (Supplementary Materials Subsubsection S2.5.1). In this period, the
correlation matrix exhibits a small positive correlation (0.12) between GROWTHC and GEX,
and a larger positive correlation (0.20) between GROWTHC and GSENSEX (Supplementary
Materials Subsection S3.5). This meant that with the rise in the growth rate of the number of
confirmed cases, the Indian currency now started improving, and the stock exchange index
started to perform better in first-order growth. Also, there is a notable negative correlation (0.30) between GSENSEX and GEX. On applying VAR, we do find a significant dependence
between GSENSEX and the one-period lagged difference in GROWTHC, evident by the
computed t-statistic (2.19) (Supplementary Materials Subsection 4.5). Looking at the IRF
graphs (Figures 5b-c), it can be seen that during this round, due to the COVID-19 shock,
GSENSEX and GEX would have taken about 8 and 4 periods (days) respectively to return to
their long-run growth trend.
Round f: Lockdown 1.0 to Unlock 1.0 (March 25 – June 30)
This round was considered to observe the overall timeline of the lockdown till the end of the
first unlock stage. The movement of the three growth rates over time for this period is
summarized in Figures 6a-6c (red lines). The three variables were checked to be stationary by
using unit root test (Supplementary Materials Subsection S1.6). Both the models with GEX
and GSENSEX as responses turn out to be significant at 5% level, with both of them having
extremely low (less than 0.001) p-values. Regression result of GEX as dependent variable on
GROWTHC and GSENSEX as covariates indicates that one-point increase in GSENSEX
causes GEX to fall by 0.078 point and the same in GROWTHC causes GEX to rise by 0.012
point (Supplementary Materials Subsubsection S2.6.3). In this period, the correlation matrix
exhibits a positive correlation (0.22) between GROWTHC and GEX, but a very small negative
correlation (-0.06) between GROWTHC and GSENSEX (Supplementary Materials Subsection
S3.6). This meant that with the rise in the growth rate of the number of confirmed cases, the
Indian currency continued improving, whereas the stock exchange index started to experience
a slightly negative growth. Also, there is a notable negative correlation (-0.39) between
GSENSEX and GEX. On applying VAR, we do find a significant dependence between
GSENSEX till a four-period lagged difference in GROWTHC, evident by the computed tstatistics (Supplementary Materials Subsection 4.1).
Round g: Pre-lockdown to Lockdown 1.0 (March 11 – April 14)

7

This round allows us to take a closer look at the relations between the growth rates of interest
at the initial stage of the pandemic, till the end of the first lockdown. In this period, the
correlation matrix exhibits a positive correlation (0.40) between GROWTHC and GEX, but a
negative correlation (-0.13) between GROWTHC and GSENSEX (Supplementary Materials
Subsection S3.7). This meant that with the rise in the growth rate of the number of confirmed
cases, the Indian currency continued depreciating, whereas the stock exchange index started to
fall. Also, there is a notable negative correlation (-0.52) between GSENSEX and GEX.
Looking at the IRF graphs from the VAR model (Figures 7a-b), it can be seen that during this
round, due to the COVID-19 shock, GSENSEX and GEX would have taken about 3 periods
(days) to return to their long-run growth trend.
Round h: Pre-lockdown to Unlock 1.0 (March 11 – June 30)
This round was considered to observe the overall timeline of the pandemic till the end of the
first unlock stage. The three variables were checked to be stationary by using unit root test
(Supplementary Materials Subsection S1.7). In this period, the correlation matrix exhibits a
positive correlation (0.28) between GROWTHC and GEX, but a negative correlation (-0.15)
between GROWTHC and GSENSEX (Supplementary Materials Subsection S3.1). This meant
that with the rise in the growth rate of the number of confirmed cases, the Indian currency
continued depreciating, whereas the stock exchange index started to fall. Also, there is a notable
negative correlation (-0.47) between GSENSEX and GEX. On applying VAR, we do find a
significant dependence between GSENSEX and the two and four-period lagged differences in
GROWTHC, evident by the computed t-statistics (Supplementary Materials Subsection 4.8).
Discussions
The main objective of this study is to explore the relationship among the number of infected
cases, exchange rate and stock market in India and to analyze the correlation among the growth
rate series of these three variables. Since October 07, 2019 to March 10, 2020, average
exchange rate of USD to INR was at 71.44 but after march 11, when the COVID-19 has been
declared to be Pandemic by WHO, the average exchange rate over the period considered
became above 75. Overall, during the course of the pandemic till the first unlock period in
India, we observed a generally positive correlation between the growth rate of infected cases
and the growth rate of exchange rate. This correlation was found to be negative between the
growth rate of infected cases and the growth rate of Sensex.
The VAR results implied that the increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases caused suggestive
but not statistically significant changes in the values of the exchange rate and Sensex, and that
due to the COVID-19 shock, the growth rate of Sensex and the growth rate of exchange rates
would have taken a substantial number of days, in general, to return to their long-run growth
trends. The decision of lockdown appears to be effective in controlling the spread of COVID19 reflected by the average daily growth rate of confirmed cases and death cases. The daily
average growth rate of confirmed cases was 17.804% before the lockdown which changes first
to 15.684% in first phase of lockdown and then to 7.55% when the lockdown is extended.
Similarly, the growth rate of deaths was 23.55% before the lockdown which first falls to
19.39% in first phase of lockdown and again to 7.27% when it is extended after April 15. These
are indications that the lockdown improved the situation to some extent.
During the first phase of lockdown, the growth rate of exchange rate stays lower than the daily
average growth rate of exchange rate observed before lockdown. With the extension of
lockdown, the daily growth rate of exchange rate becomes negative (INR being appreciated)
after April 15. During Lockdown 1.0, there is a positive correlation between GROWTHC and
GEX, but a negative correlation between GROWTHC and GSENSEX. This meant that with
8

the rise in the growth rate of the number of confirmed cases, the Indian currency continued
depreciating, whereas the stock exchange index started to fall. Also, there is a strong negative
correlation between the exchange rate and the Sensex index, implying that with the Indian
currency depreciating the stock exchange also dropped. With extension of the lockdown, clear
variabilities were observed in the relationships across the variables of interest. We found a high
degree of positive correlation between GROWTHC and GEX initially, which stayed positive
for most of the time over the entire period considered. The negative correlation between
GROWTHC and GSENSEX was almost washed out at a point and then started showing up
again towards the end.
Our investigations into the relations and interdependence between economic and health
variables in context of the pandemic and the lockdown identify strong evidences of variability
in these relationships over time. It is quite evident that these changes are extremely dynamic,
and nuanced observation at the rapidly-changing scenario is required for effective policy
decisions. Our framework is quite flexible and quick updating of the results is possible based
on new incoming data, which is why it can potentially be useful in identifying the current needs
from a decision-making perspective in the battle against COVID-19.
