Abstract
Transmission rates in epidemic outbreaks vary over time depending on the
societal and government response to infections and mortality of the disease.
Non-pharmacological mitigation strategies such as social distancing and the
adoption of protective equipment aim precisely reducing transmission rates by
reducing infectious contacts. To investigate the effects of mitigation strategies
on the evolution of epidemics, nonlinear transmission rates that are influenced
by the levels of infections, deaths or recoveries have been included in many
variants of the classical SIR model. This class of models is particularly relevant to the COVID-19 epidemic, in which the population behavior has been
affected by the unprecedented abundance and rapid distribution of global infection and death data through online platforms. This manuscript revisits a
SIR model in which the reduction of transmission rate is due to knowledge of
infections. Through a mean field approach that assumes individuals behave
like molecules in a well-mixed solution, one derives a time-varying reproduction number that depends on infection information through a negative feedback
term that is equivalent to Holling type II functions in ecology and MichaelisMenten functions in chemistry and molecular biology. A step-by-step derivation
of the model is provided, together with an overview of methods for its qualitative analysis, showing that negative feedback structurally reduces the peak of
infections. At the same time, feedback may substantially extend the duration of
an epidemic. Computational simulations agree with the analytical predictions,
and further suggest that infection peak reduction persists even in the presence
of information delays. If the mitigation strategy is linearly proportional to infections, a single parameter is added to the SIR model, making it useful to
illustrate the effects of infection-dependent social distancing.

Introduction

Compartment models are widely used to capture the long-term temporal evolution
of epidemic outbreaks. Like mean-field models in physics and chemistry, compartment models assume a well-mixed population and capture average interactions
patterns. The population is binned in distinct categories (the compartments), that at
a minimum include those susceptible to disease (S), those who become infected (I),
and those who recover (R), like in the well-known SIR model by Kermack and McKendrick (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927; Hethcote, 2000). Because the SIR model
is not suited to capture epidemics with a long incubation time, a large population
of asymptomatic individuals, and high lethality, many SIR variants with additional
compartments have been developed and tailored to model specific epidemic outbreaks (Capasso and Serio, 1978; Bootsma and Ferguson, 2007; Giordano et al.,
2020). In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, SIR-like models have been used
to forecast local outbreaks (Bertozzi et al., 2020) and to formulate recommendations for suppression and mitigation strategies (Kruse and Strack, 2020; Bin et al.,
2020; Casella, 2020; Della Rossa et al., 2020).
As the capacity of COVID-19 testing has increased, infection, recovery, and
death data have become available at the local and global level with unprecedented
speed thanks to online dashboards, apps, and media reports (Dong et al., 2020a;
Rosini, 2020; Prasse et al., 2020). This information has influenced the behavioral
choices of the public, and has been essential for governments to make critical decisions in regards to suppression and mitigation policies. While these policies can
successfully quench the epidemic with an open loop approach that discounts recent data (Bin et al., 2020; Sadeghi et al., 2020), strategies that respond in closed
loop to trends in the current level of infections, deaths, or recoveries are more likely
to be accepted or even spontaneously adopted by the population.
Compartment models have been adapted to capture the effects of societal responses (such as mitigation strategies, behavioral changes, and vaccinations) that
are influenced in closed loop by epidemic information. This has been done by introducing nonlinear transmission functions, also known as “behavioral functions”,
which are chosen empirically to be smooth threshold/saturation or polynomial functions (Capasso and Serio, 1978; Anderson and May, 1978; Korobeinikov, 2006).
One of the first contributions in this area is the SIR model variant described by
Capasso and Serio to describe the cholera epidemics in Bari in 1973, in which
the transmission rate includes a general nonlinear function of infections (Capasso
and Serio, 1978). This function is further specified to decrease and saturate as
infections increase, like Michaelis-Menten rates in biochemistry and Holling type
II functions in ecology. The general influence of nonlinear transmission rates on
the equilibria and dynamics of similar models were examined in (Liu et al., 1986,
1987), and more recently in (Korobeinikov and Maini, 2005; Kyrychko and Blyuss,
2005; Li and Zhang, 2017; Chapwanya et al., 2012; Kumar et al., 2020). Bootsma
and Ferguson adopted a SEIR model in which a nonlinear Michaelis-Menten term
captures the effects of death awareness on social interactions during the 1918 influenza epidemic in the United States (Bootsma and Ferguson, 2007). Similarly,
SIS, SIR, and SEIRS models have been modified to capture the reduction of trans2

mission and contact rates achieved by infection awareness programs (Greenhalgh
et al., 2015; Samanta and Chattopadhyay, 2014; Yu et al., 2017). These models
have also examined how infection awareness can reduce the susceptible fraction
of the population (Kiss et al., 2010; Funk et al., 2009), in particular by increasing
vaccination rates (Buonomo et al., 2008).
This manuscript revisits, examines, and provides some novel results on a class
of modified SIR models originally described by (Capasso and Serio, 1978), in which
the infection-dependent transmission rate introduces a feedback loop. Rather than
being adopted based on empirical observations, here the nonlinear transmission
rate is derived step-by-step using the law of mass action. It is assumed that individuals behave like particles in a well-mixed solution, and their interactions are modeled through equivalent chemical reactions that can be converted to ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by applying the law of mass action. Mitigation strategies
such as social distancing and use of protective equipment are modeled as reactions
that reduce successful infections at a rate that depends on current infection levels.
Through a quasi-steady state argument, one obtains a nonlinear transmission rate
parameter that includes a specific “mitigation function” term and is comparable to
Michaelis-Menten functions. This approach produces a SIR model similar to the
one described in (Section 6, (Capasso and Serio, 1978)). Because the nonlinear
transmission function decreases as a function of infections, a negative feedback
loop emerges and it is convenient to adopt the nomenclature feedback SIR (fSIR).
Most nonlinear epidemic models are positive and structurally bounded; stability
analysis of the equilibria can be done via local (linearization) or global methods
(typically Lyapunov functions), obtaining conditions for convergence to a diseasefree equilibrium, or conditions for the occurrence of bifurcations in the presence of
an endemic equilibrium (in which a fraction of the population remains infected) (Liu
et al., 1987; Korobeinikov and Maini, 2005; Kyrychko and Blyuss, 2005; Greenhalgh
et al., 2015; Weitz et al., 2020). Here the equilibria and the solutions of the fSIR
model are examined (through established approaches) with focus on comparing
the outcome in the presence and in the absence of mitigation. Specifically, I show
that a broad class of infection-dependent mitigation functions makes it possible to
reduce the peak of infections for any mitigation intensity. If the mitigation function
depends linearly on infections, it is shown that the peak is also postponed for all
positive mitigation parameters. These benefits of mitigation are however counterbalanced by the fact that the duration of the epidemic, measured as the time for
which infections persist, may significantly increase – an effect that is demonstrated
with a simple linear approximation. Computational simulations support the analysis
reported, and indicate that mitigation of the peak persists even in the presence of
delay in the transmission of infection information, which induces a moderate retardation of the time at which infections peak. Finally, for purely illustrative purposes, I
highlight that the fSIR model can qualitatively capture infection data of the COVID19 pandemic for countries like the United Kingdom, the United States and Sweden,
that opted for mitigation rather than suppression.
This brief study of the fSIR model shows that it is a helpful tool to illustrate the
effects of mitigation strategies in epidemics, with particular relevance to the COVID19 epidemic that is characterized by rapid spread of information and fluctuations in
3

social distancing patterns. While more complex models and data-driven parameter estimation are clearly needed for epidemic prediction (Anastassopoulou et al.,
2020; Giordano et al., 2020; Calafiore et al., 2020), simple yet rigorous models like
the fSIR are valuable as they provide qualitative insights. Only one term, the mitigation function, is needed in addition to the reproduction number to describe the
evolution of the epidemic in the presence of infection-based mitigation strategies.
This term reduces to a single parameter in the special case in which the mitigation
strategy is a linear function of infections. Further, this model supports mitigation
guidelines as it clearly shows that the infection curve can be flattened without postponing the peak, a misleading (and demotivating) scenario suggested by similar
models that use a constant transmission rate. At the same time, the model highlights that policies relying exclusively on infection data to regulate social distancing
can majorly extend the time required to reach a disease-free equilibrium.

1.1

Background: qualitative analysis of the non-dimensional
SIR model

The well-known SIR model is reviewed in this section to establish notation and
background concepts (Hethcote, 2000). It is assumed that the total population remains constant (birth and death processes are neglected) and the dynamics are
driven by two key parameters:
1) the disease transmission coefficient β , which depends on the social interactions
among individuals (average daily contacts) and on the infection characteristics; the
transmission rate is generally thought as the product of the average frequency of
contacts between infected and susceptible and the likelihood that infection occurs
given a contact;
2) the recovery coefficient γ , which captures the average time for recovery (or
death) of infected individuals. The inverse 1/γ is also known as duration of infectiousness. Assuming the total population is N , the original SIR model is:

β
dS
= − IS,
dt
N
dI
β
= IS − γI,

For simplicity, here we do not model the possibility of reinfection of recovered individuals (Hethcote, 1976). The transmission coefficient is normalized by the total
population size, because the number of new infections per unit time occur based on
the average infectious contacts of each susceptible individual and does not depend
on the total population size (this is also called standard incidence (Hethcote, 2000,
1976)). Because the total population is assumed to remain constant, at any point
in time R = N − I − S and the model can be reduced to two ordinary differential
equations (ODEs). Further, the variables can be normalized by the total population setting s = S/N , i = I/N (and r = R/N ); by rescaling time as τ = tγ , the

4

SIR model becomes non-dimensional, with a single coefficient R0 = β/γ , the well
known reproduction ratio or reproduction number (Hethcote, 1976).

Given initial conditions s0 = s(0) and i0 = i(0), the solutions s(τ ) and i(τ ) will
be generally denoted as s and i with the assumption that these symbols indicate
functions of time (unless otherwise noted). It is well-known that the solutions are
non-negative and satisfy the conservation law s + i + r = 1 (Hethcote, 1976).
Exact expressions for the solution have been computed (Harko et al., 2014). If
there are no infected individuals (i0 = 0), the system remains in the equilibrium
E0 = (s0 , 0, r0 ) because all derivatives are identically zero. For any initial value
of infections i0 > 0, the solutions s and i are bounded and evolve in the invariant
set P = {0 ≤ s ≤ s0 , 0 ≤ i ≤ 1, 0 ≤ r ≤ 1}. This follows from the fact that
ds/dτ ≤ 0, so s(τ ) ≤ s0 , ∀τ ≥ τ0 . The solutions and the admissible equilibria
depend on the value of R0 and on the initial value of the susceptible population s0 .
Case 1: R0 s0 = 0. This occurs when the transmission rate or the initial susceptible population are equal to zero. In either case, s(t) remains identically zero;
di/dτ ≤ 0 becomes a linear asymptotically stable equation with zero as the only
equilibrium.
Case 2: R0 s0 < 1. In this case the infected population is non-increasing because di/dτ ≤ 0, thus the epidemic does not start (the system reaches an equilibrium Ẽ = (s̃, 0, r̃)).
Case 3: R0 s0 < 1. In this case di/dτ initially increases, reaches a peak when
s = scrit = 1/R0 ≤ s0 , and finally decreases to zero. The equilibrium in this case
is E = (s̄, 0, r̄). Because s0 ≤ 1, R0 s0 > 1 ⇒ R0 > 1. For any positive i0 and
R0 s0 > 1, the relation between susceptible and infected can be computed exactly
from the ratio of di/dτ and ds/dτ (Hethcote, 1976):

di

Integrating we obtain the relation between i and s:

The peak of infections occurs when s = s∗ = 1/R0 (s = s∗ yields di/dτ = 0).
Substituting s∗ we find:

imax = i0 + s0 −

(1 + log(s0 R0 )) ,
R0

(7)

with log(s0 R0 ) > 0 because s0 R0 > 1 (we assume that prior to the start of the
epidemic the recovered population is zero, thus i0 + s0 = 1). From expression (6),

5

by setting ī = 0, we can also derive an implicit equation to find the equilibrium value
of the susceptible population:

log

s0
= R0 (1 − s̄),
s̄

(8)

which has one positive root (because s̄ < s0 ≤ 1 and R0 > 1). In other words, the
equilibrium susceptible population is positive (not all the population has become
infected), unless R0 is unrealistically large.

1.2

Flattening and reshaping the infection curve through suppression and mitigation policies

The SIR model has been often used during the COVID-19 pandemic to illustrate
how a low reproduction number R0 (or a low transmission rate β ) has the effect
6

of “flattening the (infection) curve”, i.e. reducing the infection peak while extending the duration of the epidemic. The simulations in Fig. 1 A and B compare the
SIR solutions for values of R0 = 2.5, which is close to recent estimates for the
COVID-19 outbreak (Kucharski et al., 2020), and R0 = 1.5. The infection peak
is clearly reduced when R0 = 1.5, however the infection peak is also significantly
delayed. The reproduction number depends on many factors, including societal
habits and pharmacological interventions. In 2020, reducing the reproduction number of COVID-19 is only possible by controlling societal interactions, given the lack
of approved vaccines and standardized medical treatment protocols (Stewart et al.,
2020).
Suppression (lockdown) or mitigation (social distancing and adoption of Personal Protective Equipment, PPE) policies aiming to control and extinguish the
epidemic may fluctuate over time to minimize their impact on society, thereby introducing fluctuations of R0 (Stewart et al., 2020). While useful to illustrate the concept and the effects of the reproduction number, Fig.s 1 A and B do not represent
temporal changes of R0 and are thus misleading to the public and to policymakers. During the COVID-19 epidemic, enormous research efforts are dedicated to
a continuous estimation and forecasting of the reproduction number as a function
of societal response (Giordano et al., 2020; Bertozzi et al., 2020; Anastassopoulou
et al., 2020; Kissler et al., 2020).
As of mid 2020, the most successful strategy to manage COVID-19 was full
suppression of social interactions (lockdown); states such as China, South Korea,
Italy, Spain, and France went on strict lockdown for more than two months, containing infections by Summer 2020. Qualitatively, the effects of a lockdown can be
captured by a SIR model in which R0 rapidly changes from a high to a low value;
the simulation in Fig. 1C illustrates the profile of infections under an abrupt change
of R0 from 2.5 to 0.9 after 60 days from the start of the epidemic; the diseasefree equilibrium is reached within a few months from the start of the suppression.
However, ending lockdown measures too early can cause the epidemic to restart
if s(tend )R0 > 1, as illustrated in Fig. 1D, where the lockdown is completely lifted
after 90 days (Bertozzi et al., 2020). The success of lockdown is also tied to the
ability to coordinate regulations and enforcement, and to sustain its major impact
on the economy and on the mental health of the population. Due to the significant
upfront “cost”, lockdowns are unpopular and difficult to enforce.
Mitigation strategies have been adopted in many countries during the COVID19 pandemic as a complement or replacement to lockdowns, and are thus an important phenomenon that should be included in mathematical models. Mitigation
means the reduction of large-scale public events, closure of certain businesses,
and safe-at-home orders that could be classified as social distancing; mitigation
efforts include the use of PPE such as masks, face shields, and gloves. Mitigation
policies may become more restrictive or relax over time, depending on fluctuations
of the contagion data, and on social and political climate. Restrictions to social
interactions are likely to be more effective if they are tied to the reported infections
or deaths, which increase the perceived risk of infection. With fast spread of information about testing results (Dong et al., 2020a; Rosini, 2020; Prasse et al., 2020),
knowledge of infections may be more helpful than deaths in quickly containing epi7

demics; because the average time to death for COVID-19 patients, for example, is
17 days (Zhou et al., 2020), reliable lethality information may only be available with
a significant delay.
The rest of this manuscript derives and revisits an SIR model that qualitatively
captures mitigation strategies and societal responses based on knowledge of infections, which introduce feedback in the epidemic process.

2.1

Results
Mitigation policies yield nonlinear transmission rate parameters

Here I provide a simple step-by-step derivation of a SIR model in which the transmission rate parameter varies as a function of infection-based mitigation policies,
reproducing the empirical model described by (Capasso and Serio, 1978). It is assumed that individuals behave like molecules in a well-mixed solution and interact
through equivalent chemical reactions. The corresponding ODEs are derived using
the law of mass action in chemistry. A related mean-field approach, that considers
individuals as agents that interact with a limited foraging radius has been considered in (Kolokolnikov and Iron, 2020), obtaining an exponential saturating transmission rate. In the context of predator-prey models, in (Dawes and Souza, 2013) the
population-level Holling’s functional responses is derived in a limit scenario starting
from individual-level stochastic interactions.
First, a contagion may occur when a susceptible individual (S ) and an infected
individual (I ) are in spatial proximity for some time (associated or contact state C );
this encounter may then result in two infected individuals. This can be modeled
using the equivalent chemical reactions:
ρ+

φ

*
S+I −
)−
−
− C −−* 2I,
−
ρ

where ρ+ and ρ− are the rates of association and dissociation of a susceptible and
an infected individual, and we can associate φ with the daily rate at which individuals that have been exposed become infected. The law of mass action converts
reactions like the one above to ODEs in which variables are concentrations of reactants and products, computed by dividing the number of molecules by the reaction
volume. Similarly, here one can derive an ODE for the fraction of individuals in
each compartment by dividing the number of individuals by the total population.
The ODE describing the kinetics of the fraction of individuals (c) in the associated
state (C ) is:

dc
= ρ+ s · i − (ρ− + φ)c.
dt
Because contacts occur on an hourly or daily basis, which is much faster than
timescale of the epidemic, it is sensible to assume dc/dt = 0 and derive an expres8

sion for the equilibrium level of associated individuals:

c̄ =

ρ+
s · i.
ρ− + φ

This value of c̄ is intended to represent a dynamic equilibrium at the population
level, so it indicates the average number of contacts per day. With this definition,
the transmission rate β introduced in model (1)-(2) is:

β=

ρ+ φ
,
+φ

ρ−

where φ is the probability of infection per contact, and ρ+ /(ρ− + φ) is the average
number of contacts per day per individual, a definition that is consistent with the
literature (Hethcote, 2000). a The corresponding (non-dimensional) reproduction
coefficient can be computed as earlier R0 = β/γ . Note that if ρ = 0 and φ is slow,
with this approach we would recover the SEIR model (Hethcote, 2000), where the
“contact” species C corresponds to the exposed category E . Here we will assume
that the parameter φ is large enough that the contact c̄ can be neglected in the
overall mass balance; if this were not the case, then c̄ must be explicitly included in
the mass equation s + i + c̄ + r = 1.
In the presence of mitigation policies that discourage association of individuals,
i.e. social distancing, the level of individuals in associated state C should decrease.
This can be modeled by additional, fast dissociation process that depends on the
known infection levels through a rate parameter ψ(I):
ψ(I)

C −−* S + I.
For this to be a well-posed reaction, we require the distancing parameter ψ(I) to
be a non-negative, non-decreasing function of I , with ψ(0) = 0. With this model
for dissociation, individuals in state c evolve according to the ODE:

dc
= ρ+ s · i − (ρ− + φ)c − ψ(i) · c,
dt
which equilibrates to:


c̄ =

ρ+
ρ− + φ



s · i,
1 + κ(i)

κ(i) =

ψ(i)

ρ− + φ

With this equilibrium value for the average contacts, we derive a time-varying expression for the reproduction number that depends on the infection levels:

R(i) = R0

1
.
1 + κ(i)

(9)

a This definition of β can be verified by using the law of mass action to write the ODEs of s and i. For
example

ds
= −ρ+ s · i − ρ− c,
dt
in which c has to be replaced by its equilibrium value c̄.

The function κ(i) is in units of /time/individual (or fraction of individuals, the equivalent of a normalized concentration in chemical reaction networks). Thus R(i) is
non-dimensional like R0 .
Expression (9) is equivalent to Holling type II functions in ecology, and MichaelisMenten/Hill functions in chemical kinetics, and indicates that under a policy in which
social distancing depends on the infection levels, the reproduction number R(i) decreases as the infection numbers raise (Capasso and Serio, 1978; Bootsma and
Ferguson, 2007; Li and Zhang, 2017). One can think about the feedback term
1/(1 + κ(i)) as a reduction of the duration or frequency of infectious contacts introduced by social distancing policies.
Another successful approach to mitigate the spread of contagions is to recommend the use of PPE such as masks and gloves when the number of infected individuals increases. A simple way to model the average effect of PPE is to assume a
change in the likelihood of infection following a contact:
ρ+

φ(I)

−−
S+I )
−*
− C −−* 2I,
ρ

−

with φ(I) being a decreasing function of the level of infections: the more contagions are known, the more widespread is the use of PPE, the lower the chance
of becoming infected. One ought to assume that in the absence of information on
infections, the natural infection probability is recovered, i.e. φ(0) = φ. A suitable
function is:

φ(I) =

φ
,
1 + ξ(I)

with ξ(0) = 0, and ξ(I) non-negative, non-decreasing. With a timescale separation
argument one can find the average daily level of (normalized) infectious contacts:

c̄ =

ρ+
.
ρ− + ξ(i)

With this expression, the time-varying reproduction number is:

R(i) = R0

1
,
1 + κ(i)

κ(i) =

ρ− ξ(i)
.
ρ− + φ

This result is identical to equation (9) if we take ξ(i) = ψ(i)/ρ− . For this reason,
from now on we will use the time-varying reproduction number (9) as a general
expression to model the effects of infection-aware mitigation on the dynamics of an
epidemic. In the rest of the manuscript, κ(i) will be called mitigation function.

The feedback SIR model

With infection-aware mitigation policies, the non-dimensional SIR model (4)-(5) becomes the feedback SIR (fSIR) model:

In the fSIR model the transmission rate is the nonlinear function R(i) = R0 1+κ(i)
;
we assume the mitigation function κ(i) is a non-negative, non decreasing function
of i, with κ(0) = 0. For the simple case in which κ(i) = κi (mitigation function
linearly proportional to infections), R(i) decreases monotonically as a function of
i, and it decreases more steeply for large values of κ, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The
larger κ, the smaller the value of i that induces a significant reduction in R0 (i.e.
distancing and PPE are adopted in response to a very small outbreak). For example, a value of κ = 2 results in R(i) = R0 /2 when i = 0.5; a value of κ = 10 cuts
in half R0 much sooner, when i = 0.1.

Figure 2: In the case of mitigation function linearly proportional to infections, κ(i) =
κ · i, the infection-dependent reproduction number (9) is monotonically decreasing
as a function of infections, for any choice of κ ≥ 0.
The mitigation function κ(i) models the average population response to knowledge of current infection numbers, in relation to typical interaction patterns; this
coefficient could also be used to model the collective “trust” in infection information. For κ(i) = 0, i.e. there is no reaction/policy, nor trust on infection data, then
R(i) = R0 . (Similarly, if there are no infections and i = 0, then we have no change
in R(i) = R0 because κ(0) = 0).
The time varying reproduction number R(i) introduces a negative feedback
loop in the epidemic model, because captures the fact that society mitigates interactions in response to an increase of infections, thereby reducing the reproduction
number. This expression for R(i) also models the return to typical interaction patterns when infections are no longer present.

Properties of the fSIR model
Analysis of equilibria

Local equilibrium analysis and and global stability analysis of SIR models with nonlinear transmission rates has been extensively carried out in the literature (Capasso
and Serio, 1978; Liu et al., 1987; Korobeinikov and Maini, 2005). A brief discussion
of the local stability of equilibria is reported below for illustrative purposes.
If i0 = 0 (r0 = 0), the system remain at the equilibrium E0 = (s0 , 0, 0) because
all derivatives are identically zero. For any 0 < i0 < 1, the solutions are bounded
and evolve in the invariant set P = {0 ≤ s ≤ s0 , 0 ≤ i ≤ 1, 0 ≤ r ≤ 1}. If
R0 s0 ≤ 1 + κ(i0 ), the infected population is non-increasing because di/dτ ≤ 0,
the epidemic does not start and the system reaches an equilibrium Ē = (s̄, 0, r̄).
Like in the SIR model, because s0 ≤ 1, for the epidemic to start it is necessary that
R0 > 1 + κ(i0 ).
If R0 s0 > 1 + κ(i0 ), di/dτ > 0 until the susceptible population decreases to the
value s = scrit = (1+κ(imax ))/R0 > R0 at which i(τ ) = imax . As the susceptible
population continues to decrease, so does the infected population and the system
reaches an equilibrium E = (s̄, 0, r̄).
Proposition 1 Assume R0 s0 > 1 + κ(i0 ). Any equilibrium Ē = (s̄, 0, r̄) is locally
stable.

Note that by assuming different nonlinear transmission rates, and including
birth, death, and reinfection rates, endemic equilibria may emerge in which the
equilibrium infectious population is positive, and bifurcations may occur (Liu et al.,
1987; Hethcote, 2000; Korobeinikov and Maini, 2005).
2.3.2

Analysis of the solutions: advantages and disadvantages of infectionbased feedback

By assuming that the derivative of the nonlinear transmission rate R(i) is bounded
and has a maximum at i = 0, (Capasso and Serio, 1978) demonstrate global positivity, uniqueness, and global stability of the solutions for the fSIR model; these
12

results can be extended to similar models that include birth, death, and reinfection rates, and assumptions on the transmission rate can be relaxed as reviewed
in (Korobeinikov, 2006). Here κ(i) is assumed to be non-decreasing, and zero for
i = 0, yielding a nonlinear transmission rate that is non-increasing and equal to R0
for i = 0 (Korobeinikov, 2006). In this case, it is shown that the peak of infections
is always reduced in the presence of distancing. I will also summarize results that
exist for the case in which the mitigation function is linear (κ(i) = κ · i), and provide
some additional qualitative result in regards to the time at which the infection peak
occurs.
Problem 1 The fSIR model (10)-(11) with initial conditions s0 ≥ 0, i0 > 0, r0 ≥ 0,
and s0 R0 > 1 + κ(i0 ) defines an initial value problem (IVP) with non-negative solutions. We assume the mitigation function κ(i) is a non-negative, non-decreasing
function with κ(0) = 0, and we look for properties of the solutions of this IVP that
hold for any R0 . These properties will be contrasted to the limit case κ(i) = 0 that
corresponds to the IVP defined by the SIR model (4)-(5).
The solution for κ(i) = 0 as well as its features will be denoted with the superscript
0
( i.e. if κ(i) = 0, i0 (τ ) = i(τ )).
Nonlinear mitigation function: In the general case of a nonlinear mitigation
function κ(i), I will show that the peak of infections in the fSIR model is smaller than
the infection peak for the SIR model, for any non-negative κ(i); to the best of my
knowledge, this is a novel result. No assumption is needed on the boundedness of
the derivative of κ(i) like in (Capasso and Serio, 1978).
Proposition 2 In Problem 1, for any R0 and for any κ > 0, we have:

imax < i0max .
Proof Following the same approach used to derive (7), the peak of infection for the
fSIR model can be estimated as follows:

1 + κ(i)
di
= −1 +
.
ds
R0 s
We then obtain the infinitesimal expression:

di = −ds +

ds

+ κ(i)

(13)

in which the last term cannot be easily integrated, but it can be replaced by a
simpler expression. Rearranging the terms of the ODE (10) we find:

1 ds

R0 s
1 + κ(i)
which can be substituted in the last term of equation (13):

When κ(i) = 0 we recover the original SIR infection peak expression (7), here
denoted as i0max . The difference between the peak value (15) and i0max (the peak
when κ(i) = 0) is:

Because log(1 + x) < x for any x > 0, and because the last integral is strictly
positive, we conclude that imax < i0max for any κ > 0.

Corollary 1 In Problem 1, the equilibrium of susceptible individuals s̄ is always
lower bounded by the equilibrium s̄0 .
Proof At equilibrium it must be that ī = 0, and equation (14) yields:

where τ̄ is the time it takes to reach equilibrium. The equilibrium 0 ≤ s̄ ≤ 1 must
satisfy this equation. If κ(i) = 0 for all i, we recover expression (8): the left side
of the equation is a curve that decreases monotonically as a function of s̄, and the
right side of the equation is a line with slope −R0 and intercept R0 when s̄ = 0.
If κ(i) 6= 0, the left side of the equation is unchanged. The right side is still a line
with slope −R0 , however it intercepts the y−axis at a point b < R0 , because the
integral term is non-negative for any value of κ; this is equivalent to shifting down
the line. Thus, when κ(i) 6= 0, the intersection point s̄ of the curves on the left
and right side of the equation intercept must be larger than the intersection when
κ(i) = 0.

This proposition shows that, relative to an epidemic that lacks negative feedback, the fSIR model settles to a larger susceptible population in the disease-free
equilibrium for any value of R0 and mitigation function. As a consequence, the
equilibrium recovered population satisfies r̄ < r̄0 .

Linear mitigation function: In the case of mitigation function linearly proportional to infections, κ(i) = κ · i, the fSIR model can be solved exactly in phase
space as demonstrated in (Capasso and Serio, 1978) and (Baker, 2020):

and the corresponding infection peak can be found exactly; it can be verified that
the infection peak always decreases with κ as predicted by Proposition 2.
To the best of my knowledge, an exact solution of fSIR with linear mitigation
function has not been found. However, similar models with other particular forms
of the nonlinear transmission rate can be solved exactly (Bohner et al., 2019).
I conjecture that in the presence of mitigation (κ > 0) the time at which the
infection peak occurs is always delayed (although moderately) relative to the SIR
model. While this conjecture is corroborated by numerical computations, a formal
proof is left for future work.

2.4

Computational simulations

In these computational simulations I consider the fSIR model with linear mitigation
function κ(i) = κ · i for illustrative purposes. It is assumed that κ remains constant
unless otherwise noted.
Fig. 3, top, shows the numerically integrated solution of the fSIR model (10)-(11)
with R0 = 2.5 as the parameter κ is varied. (R0 = 2.5 corresponds to a choice
of β = 0.25 and γ = 1/10, i.e. the average time to recovery or death assumed to
be 10 days; for comparison, the estimated average time to recovery in the COVID19 epidemic is about 17 days for hospitalized patients (Zhou et al., 2020)). These
15

simulations confirm that the peak of infections decreases with a large κ, relative
to the case κ = 0 (SIR without feedback). Fig. 3, bottom, shows the temporal
evolution of the reproduction number in each simulation in the top panel: when
infections increase, R(τ ) decreases; as infections decrease, R(τ ) converges to
the nominal level (R0 = 2.5).
The duration of an epidemic is extended in the presence of mitigation
Simulations in Fig. 3 suggest that a large value of κ extends the duration of the
epidemic. This is evident by examining an approximation of the fSIR solution (Problem 1): when κ is very large, thus κ · i  1, the fSIR can be approximated by the
linear system:

R0
dŝ
≈−
ŝ,
dτ

R0
≈
ŝ − î.
dτ
κ

(17)


R0
R0  −τ
e − e− κ τ .
κ − R0

(18)

The solution î(τ ) can be found exactly:

î(τ ) = i0 e−τ + s0

This approximation shows that if R0 /κ  1 the infection dynamics converge very
slowly to î = 0 (convergence is dominated by the constant R0 /κ).
Simulations in Fig. 4 compare infections in a SIR and fSIR model with focus on
the timescale of convergence to the disease-free equilibrium. Cumulative infections
under the unmitigated epidemic are higher than in the mitigated case. However,
the unmitigated epidemic extinguishes in about 6 months; in contrast, the infectionaware mitigation strategy maintains a significant level of infectious individuals for a
much longer time. Further, after 3 years, the unmitigated epidemic cannot generate
another outbreak (R0 s < 1), while the mitigated case may generate a new outbreak
if social distancing and PPE were to be abandoned allowing R0 to return to its
original value.
Infection-aware mitigation strategies reduce the peak of infection and do not
postpone the peak significantly
The simulations in Fig. 3 confirm the results of Propositions 2, because the infection peak is always reduced. Additional simulations in Fig. 5 show that with a
feedback parameter κ = 2 (taken as an illustrative value) the infection peak size
can be reduced by about 30%, but this also causes a 30% extension of the time
during which more than 2.5% of the population is infected. This is consistent with
the observation made earlier that the duration of the epidemic is extended when
adopting infection-dependent mitigation policies.
2.4.1

Effects of delayed infection awareness

Delays in detecting and reporting infections are to be expected (Li et al., 2020).

convergence for SIR and fSIR. After 3 years, the SIR model does not admit a new
outbreak; in contrast, if mitigation were to be completely relaxed (R0 = 2.5) the
fSIR model could generate a new peak of infections because R0 s > 1.

ported here, it may be pursued using local or global methods used for very similar
models in (Beretta and Takeuchi, 1995; Huang et al., 2010; Kyrychko and Blyuss,
2005; Kumar et al., 2020; Li and Liu, 2014). Rather, computational simulations are
used here to examine whether a delay ∆ in obtaining infection information can compromise the effects of mitigation feedback. A delay is included in the transmission
rate expression:

While stability of this model with delay is not examined here, global stability analysis of SIR models with nonlinear transmission and delays have been demonstrated
in (Huang et al., 2010), and likely hold in this case.
For illustrative purposes, I choose a feedback parameter κ = 2 that remains
fixed in these simulations, with R0 = 2.5 (β = 0.25 and γ = 1/10). Fig. 6 shows
that a delay of up to 7 days increases the peak by less than 10%, but a 14 day
delay causes a 25% increase in the peak, offsetting the peak reduction obtained
by introducing feedback (the simulated non-dimensional delay is divided by the
rescaling constant γ = 1/10).

2.4.2

The fSIR model captures the COVID-19 infection trends in the presence
of mitigation strategies

The fSIR model was fitted to COVID-19 temporal series data for infections, recoveries, and deaths available from the Johns Hopkins Github repository (Dong
19

et al., 2020b), last accessed on July 15, 2020. I selected data from four western
democracies: Italy, United Kingdom, Sweden, and the United States. The data
were processed to compute active infections in a given day, and recoveries and
deaths were summed and consolidated into the “recovered” compartment. All data
were normalized by country population and thresholded to include only data collected after infections exceed 3 per million. Parameters were fitted with constraints
β ∈ [0 0.6], β ∈ [1/20 1/10], and κ ∈ [0 10 · 103 ]; in the fitting score function,
the infection prediction error was assigned a 100-fold penalty relative to the recovery data, with the expectation that recoveries may not be accurately reported for
non-hospitalized patients. As a consequence, infection data are reproduced much
more closely than recovery data by computationally generated trajectories that use
fitted parameters.
Initial epidemic data in Italy, UK, Sweden, and the US are comparable, with reported infections and deaths showing similar doubling time of 2-4 days in the early
(exponential) stages (Bertozzi et al., 2020). Mitigation or suppression measures
were not immediately enacted, unlike countries such as South Korea, Japan, and
Singapore that rapidly imposed lockdowns and contact tracing. (Timing and duration of initial interventions are critical for a successful containment (Sadeghi et al.,
2020).)
Italy is an example country that, like Spain and France, imposed and enforced
a strict suppression strategy (lockdown), which resulted in a very limited number of
new infections as of June 2020. While also the UK officially imposed lockdown/stayat-home orders, their enforcement appears to have been less successful than Italy,
as shown in Fig. 7. From the beginning, Sweden followed a mitigation strategy
relying on personal responsibility of citizens to limit the spread of the virus, rather
than on a strict lockdown strategy. Finally, the US is an example of a federal state
in which disparate containment approaches were enacted at different times, from
a tight lockdown in some states like New York and Michigan, to loose mitigation
policies in other states like Arizona, Texas, and Florida. Interestingly, infection data
from both Sweden and the US show a trend change around the end of May 2020,
which is marked qualitatively by a black line at day 90 in Fig. 8. Because the overall
US data includes contributions from all states, the first phase is likely dominated
by the major outbreaks and lockdowns in the north eastern states in March and
April 2020, while the second phase is dominated by southern states that relaxed
mitigation strategies in May 2020.
The fSIR model can cannot reproduce the infection data from Italy (in addition,
the fitted transmission parameter β is unrealistically high, and so is R0 ). Italy’s
COVID-19 reaction can be reproduced with a SIR model with a time-varying R0
tied to fluctuations in lockdown measures (Casella, 2020), that do not depend on
infection levels (until new infections are nearly completely eliminated). In contrast,
the fSIR model reproduces very well active infection trends in the UK, with realistic
fitted parameters, suggesting that the UK lockdown measures were as effective as
an infection-based mitigation strategy. The fitted value of κ ≈ 1107 means that
a substantial societal reaction (reduction of the transmission coefficient) occurred
relatively late in the epidemic, roughly when 0.1% of the population was reported
to be infected.
20

To fit infection data from the US and Sweden, we imposed single value of β
and γ but allowed two distinct values of mitigation parameter κ to capture the two
apparent phases of the outbreak. In both cases, the fitted values of β and γ are
realistic, and the values of κ decrease in the second phase, suggesting that mitigation strategies were overall relaxed or that their effectiveness decreased over
time.
Even though all these countries ramped up their testing efforts, actual infection
data are always underestimated. For this reason, it is interesting to test changes in
the fSIR fitted parameters assuming a larger number of individuals affected by the
epidemic. If data are scaled by X-fold (i.e. infections and recoveries are believed to
be X-times larger than reported), the fitted κ qualitatively scales by a factor 1/X ,
while changes in fitted β and γ are negligible.

Active infections Deaths + recoveries

Figure 7: COVID-19 active infection and recovery/death data for Italy and the United
Kingdom, fitted using the fSIR model; the reproduction coefficient R(t) is shown
in the insets. The fSIR model cannot capture the Italian infection data, as strict
lockdown policies were enacted and enforced without relaxation for a sufficiently
long time; this scenario would be better captured by a nearly discrete change in
the reproduction coefficient (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the fSIR model reproduces very
well active infection data in the UK, with realistic estimates for the transmission rate
and R(t). This suggests that in practice, the UK strategy may be classified as an
infection-based mitigation approach. Data fitting details are in Section 2.4.2.
This data fitting exercise has largely an illustrative purpose, and is not meant to
put forward any predictions. The pitfalls of relaxing mitigation policies too early are
discussed in detail using many models that are more complex and accurate than
the one presented here (Kissler et al., 2020; Giordano et al., 2020).

Conclusion

I have derived and examined the properties of a modified SIR model, here named
feedback SIR (fSIR), in which infection-based mitigation policies introduce a reproduction number that decreases a continuous function of infection levels, generating
a negative feedback loop. This simple model was originally described by (Capasso
and Serio, 1978), and here it is derived from first principles by considering cases in
which individuals reduce their contacts or use PPE as more infections are reported.
Using a time-scale separation argument, it was shown that the transmission rate
function takes the form of a Holling type II or Michaelis-Menten function popular in
ecology, chemistry and biology. It was demonstrated that mitigation based on infection awareness always reduces the infection peak, but substantially lengthens the
duration of the epidemic. In the special case of a mitigation function that is linear
with respect to infection information, this model requires only one additional parameter to capture the effects of social distancing and is amenable to exact analysis (Baker, 2020). Extending the results presented here to an fSEIR model appears
trivial, but is left for future work.
The reduction of transmission rate as a function of knowledge of infections, recoveries, or deaths goes beyond non-pharmacological mitigation strategies. While
it is unlikely that vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 will be available before 2021, information about infection levels is likely to increase the likelihood of mass vaccination
and thus cause a substantial decrease in the susceptible population; models like
the one presented here may describe well this scenario (Bootsma and Ferguson,
2007; Kiss et al., 2010; Buonomo et al., 2008). As widespread access to real-time
epidemic information is available, and contact tracing becomes prevalent, closed22

loop feedback regulation of epidemics is within reach. The role of nonlinear transmission parameters that introduce feedback is yet to be ascertained within more
sophisticated compartment models developed for COVID-19 (Kissler et al., 2020;
Giordano et al., 2020). While accurate forecasting will take advantage of complex
models integrating data on multiple scales, simple models like the one presented
here can provide general insights and guidelines to policymakers, doctors, and educators.
