Abstract—Covid-19 pandemic generated many problems and
show other hidden issues in countries in South America. Every
government analyzed his own context and decided which health
policies would be used. Peru is a country in the middle of South
America region, the first reported case was on March 6. Besides,
a lockdown was established in ground borders, sea and air.
Peruvian government analyzed the context and proposed many
policies around health, economy, employment, transport. But,
these action were not enough for the existence of previous lack
of infrastructure in hospitals, as result of past governments. By
the other hand, a variety of politic parties in the Parliament
and their search for own interests, was evidenced during this
pandemic period. Considering previous condition of lack of
success in health, economic policies, the discussion about possible
impeachment started. Therefore, this work has the main aim of
finding evidence about what users were talking about and what
was the impact on Peruvian population using Twitter.

I. INTRODUCTION
The pandemic Covid-19 is an special event that transform
the society. Many governments around the world present their
strategies to stop the spread of this virus [1]. Peru is a country
in South America that implements one of the most strict
quarantine in the world with poor results [2]. Moreover, the
current government was involved in a cover-up scandal of
possible undue payments [3]. For this reason, the congress
decided to initiate a impeachment process against the Peruvian
president [4].
Analyse the opinion of people in this kind of context
is extremely important. Understand the collective reactions
provides crucial information to make decisions. Some statistics
during the impeachment show us that Peruvian people was
against the impeachment [5]. Thus, we want to analyse the
interest of the people during the impeachment in Twitter. This
social media is a powerful social network that has been used
for many political studies [6], [7].
In this study, we analyse a variety of topics related with the
impeachment. We work in five parts the data collection, query
setup, preprocessing, filtering and visualization. The analysis
show us the Peruvian cities with more activity, the words more
frequent, and the emotional force of them before, after, and
during the impeachment.

II. LITERATURE REVIEW
In this section, we will evaluate some investigations related
with the proposal.
In the article [7], the authors explore the political discourse
of trump on social media Twitter. They could analyze social
polarity like ”white supremacists”. Also, the main topics in
Trump’s discourse were in populism and conspiracy rather
than detailed policy prescriptions. This analysis provides information about people’s interaction on Twitter. Showing that
Trump’s tweets focus on discredit technologies companies,
claim Twitter is biased against Trump, and there is a Shadow
Banning (soft censorship) against Republicans.
In the article [8], the authors explore the change in presidential talk caused by Trump. They focus on two main points:
the message and the spreading in Twitter. They analyze some
controversial tweets made by the president and how they
change the common way to do politics. They produce an
anthropological analysis of his tweets. The result show us that
there is a signal of shift in the discourse strategy from a wide
electorate to a core one.
In the article [9], they analyse the tweets with fake news
and valid information. They focus on verified and non verified
counts with and without verified information. The results show
that the fake news are spread easily than verified information. They use hashtags like ”COVID-19”, ”Corona”, and
”#2019 ncov”.
In the article [10], the authors study the global sentiment
around Covid-19 pandemic using twitter trends. They conclude
that fear was the main emotion at the beginning but the angry
was increasing at the same time the fear was decreasing.
Finally, the sadness was increasing related with the lost of
family and friends.
All these articles show us that is possible analyze the current
emotional and political situation of a country using twitter
as social network. In this project, we focus on the sentiment
analysis using some strategies in these articles to analyse the
Peruvian president impeachment.
The distribution of the paper follows: section II, literature
review and section III, the proposal. Section IV, results and
section V, conclusion. Finally, section VI, future work.

A. Select scope
The topic around Peruvian impeachment was selected because the relevance of this political action. Actually, Peru
has many problems as results of insufficient or inefficient
health, economical, employment policies. Therefore, study
how Peruvian users interaction was during these weeks is
relevant. The study needs to get data from each region from
Peru to have global opinion, idea from the impact of the
event on Peruvian population. It is necessary to mention that
Peruvian country has 25 regions.
B. Setup Query
The collection of data is using API (Application Programming Interface) from Twitter, with the next parameters:
• Range Date: 05-09 to 12-09, 14-09 to 21-09 and 20-09
to 28-09
• Keywords: considering the context, all the tweets generated during the range data were collected
• Geolocalization and radius: latitude, longitude and radius
are presented in Tab. III-B, the radius were selected
manually considering the prior knowledge of population
concentration in regions.
• Language: Spanish

C. Preprocessing
The preprocessing step is necessary to clean data and
process it later to filter and get a good visualization.
• First, there is overposition of dates then it is necessary to
drop duplicates.
• Natural Language Processing task is applied, all text to
lowercase and removal of urls using regular expressions
• Remove stopwords, i.e articles, pronouns and custom
words, i.e. mas (but), si (if), rt
D. Filtering
•

•

Topic of study is around impeachment, president, martin
vizcarra (Peruvian president) then a filtering of the data
is performed using these terms.
Besides, a second removal is performed, deleting previous
terms.

E. Visualization
This step is important because it provides graphical support
to perform the analysis. Frequency histogram are used to show
the number of tweets per day, city. Cloud of words to show the
most frequent words per city. And, line plot are used to show
different trends and help the visualization of many sources.
IV. RESULTS
This section presents the results of the exploration of data
using Text Mining techniques. From the description of the
dataset, results after filtering steps mentioned in the previous
section. And, Google Trends source is added to strengthen the
analysis.

Fig. 2. Total Collected Tweets per city - Daily

From this graphic is possible to notice, the three regios with
more tweets Lima, La Libertad and Arequipa. Besides, the
three regions with less publications are: Apurimac, Huancavelica and Pasco. The first ones are located in the coast, Lima is
the capital of Peru and La Libertad is a neighbor region and
Arequipa is one of the most populated regions. By the other
hand, Apurimac, Huancavelica and Pasco are located in the
middle of Highlands then these regions has a lower population
and the Internet access can be an issue.
Next question wants to show how many publications/posts
were generated during these weeks.
B. How was the frequency of post in Peru per city?
Using date field is possible to generate a new field considering a substring of date wich follows the next format: YYYYMM-DD. Then, it is possible count the number of tweets
considering this new field. The objective of this graphic is to
check how was the flow of publications during this range date
from: 05-09 to 28-09. Considering the events were happening
during these three weeks, the daily posts are presented in Fig.
2. Then, it is possible to notice there was more interaction
around September 11 and 21 in the majority of regions.
During this two days, 11 and 21 September were the peak
of the topic around impeachment in Peruvian country. This
was a final of a deny of impeachment [11] in Peru country.
Therefore, next question is formulated to be more specific
about impeachment in this country.

step is possible to check how the number of publications per
region around this concern during the range of date of the
actual study.
Then, the next question is related to identify what terms or
words appear or are related to impeachment.
D. What kind of topics are related to this Peruvian posts?
Considering the filtered data from previous subsection is
possible to generate a cloud of words. This representation can
help to see terms with higher frequency around the keywords.
After the filtering step, these keywords are removed because
they are not useful to know terms around them. For this reason,
an extraction of these terms are performed and new cloud of
words is generated, Fig. 4.
Considering news around impeachment, this action was
supported for some parliamentary people. Edgar Alarcon,
Karem Roca and Richard Swing are people involved in some
audios about some possible irregular actions [12] around the

mocion. By the other hand, on Sunday (20-09) and Monday
(21-09), bigrams: planta oxigeno, inaugura planta mentioned
the creation of one factory to produce oxygen which is vital
to people with high or severe diagnostic of covid-19. Finally,
Monday 28-09, one more time bigrams mention: karen roca,
karen rocafabio.
E. How positive or negative were the comments?
A sentimental analysis task were performed, and values
between 0 and 1 were obtained. A threshold 0.5 is used to
establish which comments were negative or positive and this
analysis is replicated for all the days. Then, the results are
presented in Fig. 6, it is evident that negative/positive comments were balanced before of 09-08 and suffered two main
peaks, 11-09 and 19-09. First peak are related to impeachment
process after the release of audios and second one, after of

the deny of impeachment. It is important to mention that the
number of negative publications decrease meaningfully.
Then, this analysis can help us to understand how was
the appreciation of Peruvian users before, during and after
of impeachment process.
F. What other Digital Sources can be used for the analysis?
Using experience of other works related to use Digital data,
Google trends can be an interesting source to measure trends
related to search using Google Engine Search. Then, it is
possible to know the trends around one term or keyword,
setting the range of date for the analysis. The graphic 7
is presenting the frequency of tweets from Peruvian users
and google trends of next keywords: Congreso (Parlament),
Martin Vizcarra, Vacancia (impeachment). Besides, to dive
in the results of google trends, results from Youtube search
about Martin Vizcarra because people was interested or curious about the impeachment topic. Scales of each seris is

tranformed to fit in values between 0 to 100. Then, considering
the graphic is possible to check a constant increasing from 0909 and decay after 11-09. Later, a second wave started from
18-09 to 21-09, after this day the interest decay.
V. CONCLUSION
Data coming from Social Network Twitter can be useful
to analysis and detect events which happened or happens in
one specific location. The analysis of data coming from Twiter
reflect the state of Peruvian users before, during and after of
the impeachment process. Performing a sentimental analysis
can confirm how negative was the event for the population.
Finally, adding Google trends, the previous conclusions can
be strengthen, because users were using Google search engine
to search about this topics during this weeks.
VI. FUTURE WORK
For future work, an analysis of news coming from Peru can
be analyzed to support the analysis. Besides, the analysis of
publications from other social networks can be performed, i.e.
Facebook or comments from blogs/websites where users can
express their opinions and ideas.
