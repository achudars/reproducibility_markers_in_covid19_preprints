Abstract. For a long time, investigation into the weak interactions of quarks has guided us toward understanding the Standard Model we know today. Now in the era of high precision, these studies are still one of
the most promising avenues for peering beyond the Standard Model. This is a large-scale endeavour with
many tales and many protagonists. In these pages I follow a few threads of a complex story, those passing
through the realm of lattice gauge theory.

1 Introduction
In the Standard Model (SM), flavor-changing interactions
are mediated by W bosons. Electroweak symmetry breaking gives mass to the quarks and, in doing so, induces
mixing between the SU(2)L doublets. The relation between weak eigenstates and mass eigenstates is given by
the Cabibbo-Kobyashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix

Taking into account the requirement of the unitarity of
VCKM and the phase-invariance of the quark fields, there
are four independent parameters governing quark flavorchanging interactions.
There could be more to the story, however. Is there
a reason why electroweak symmetry breaking produces a
light scalar boson with a mass just so? Is there another
undiscovered source of CP violation in the quark sector
which could explain why matter dominates antimatter in
the universe? Is there a particle which could make up
the dark matter inferred from astrophysical observations?
Many of the “Beyond the Standard Model (BSM)” models
addressing these questions could affect quark flavor interactions.
By making a plethora of measurements with increasing precision, particle physicists hope to constrain the four
independent CKM parameters so tightly that an inconsistency emerges, a gap that could only be explained by BSM
physics. Because experiments measure the weak interactions of hadrons, the bound states of quarks, precise QCD
calculations are required to draw inferences about quark
interactions from these measurements. This is where lattice QCD plays an important role, one which I aim to
review here.

In the pages that follow, I will focus on a few stories
rather than attempt an encyclopedic account. In studying these stories, I was struck by the emergence of some
common features, which in turn reminded me of the notion of a “monomyth” or “Hero’s Journey,” popularized
by Joseph Campbell in the late 1980’s. Literary work fitting this template includes The Iliad and The Odyssey,
Moby Dick, and Jane Eyre. At the time Campbell illustrated the theory with Star Wars as his main example.
Tolkien’s The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings also follow
the same arc.
Figure 1 depicts some key points in The Hero’s Journey. Many of these resonate with the adventures of flavor
physics heroes. It all starts with an idea for a new measurement, a new calculation, a new BSM signature. A fellowship must be formed. A proposal must be written in
order to satisfy the gatekeepers; this often requires good
luck or other supernatural aid. The flavor hero cannot
get far into the unknown without the aid of helpers and
mentors, be they technicians, accelerator experts, research
software engineers, or otherwise. Many challenges must be
faced – bugs, downtime, statistical and systematic errors
– and temptations must be resisted – premature publication, under- (or over-)estimating uncertainties. Finally
the innermost cave is reached, where scientific progress is
made, error bars reduced, tensions made or released. The
flavor hero is reborn and must carry their revelation back
to the known world. Results must be interpreted and explained. A sacrificial act of atonement must be made to
satisfy peer reviewers. Finally the hero can rest and contemplate new adventures.
In these pages I tell a few tales of these adventurers. In
the tradition of oral storytelling, this version will be different from the ones told by others, at least in the details.
Nevertheless out of the many tellers telling tales, a saga
emerges.

2 CKM
Most of the flavor physics stories are set in the square of
the CKM matrix, with its broad avenue down the diagonal and its two darker corners on either side. As long
as quark flavor measurements consistently agree with the
CKM parametrization, the Standard Map of weak interactions is sufficient to capture everything. After decades
of refining the map, it is quite detailed now. Flavor heroes
have to work very hard to try to find discrepancies.
We can organize the various adventures according to
paths through the map, three east-to-west, and one northto-south. I will include several details, but a much more
detailed review is available from the Flavour Lattice Averaging Group (FLAG) [1] (also see their 2020 web update
[2]).
In order to be accurate beyond 10-20%, lattice QCD
calculations must include the effects of light sea quarks
[3]. Most modern work also includes a dynamical strange
quark, with its mass tuned close to the physical value. The
calculations I discuss below have either 2 + 1 or 2 + 1 + 1
flavors of sea quarks, the difference being whether charm
sea quark effects are included.
For quark masses at scales where αs (mq ) is small, one
can estimate the effects of heavy sea quarks perturbatively.
Expanding the fermion determinant in inverse powers of
mq , one finds that contributions from charm quark loops
are of the order αs (ΛQCD /2mq )2 [4]. For the charm quark,
this is at the 1-2% level (e.g. [5]). A recent study looking
at the charmonium spectrum in theories with either 0 or
2 dynamical charm-like quarks (and no other sea quarks)
found quenching effects in agreement with the perturbative estimate [6]. Therefore, in some places where the effects of quenching the charm quark are negligible compared to other uncertainties, I average together 2+1 and
2+1+1 calculations.

Unitarity of the CKM matrix implies that |Vud |2 +|Vus |2 +
|Vub |2 = 1. This section is really about |Vud | and |Vus | since
|Vub | is so small. The important tale of |Vub | will be told
later.
The matrix element |Vud | is most precisely determined
through superallowed nuclear β decays [7]. Recent reevaluations of radiative corrections [8, 9, 10] have shifted the
central value for |Vud | down by 2σ to |Vud | = 0.97370(14)
compared to the 2018 PDG value [11, 12]. Consequences
of this shift are still being studied [13, 14], so there may
be more to the story. A test of first-row unitarity crucially
depends on |Vud |, given its relative size.
|Vud | can also be inferred from neutron β decay. This
relies on precise knowledge of the neutron lifetime, the ratio of axial vector to vector couplings, gA , and the same
electroweak radiative corrections discussed above. There
is presently some disagreement in experimental measurements of the neutron lifetime depending on whether it is
determined in beam experiments or with trapped ultracold neutrons [15]. In principle lattice QCD could contribute with a determination of gA , but the experimental
measurement [16] is a more precise than lattice results [17,
18, 19] by a factor of about 50. In Ref. [20] an argument
is made to prefer the lifetimes from trapped neutron experiments. Taking their average for the mean lifetime, the
recent result for gA [16], and the new radiative correction
[8] leads to a |Vud | from neutron decay of 0.97377(78), an
uncertainty 5 times larger than from the nuclear decays.
Pion β decay, π + → π 0 e+ νe , can also tell us about
|Vud |. The hadronic form factor at zero recoil is equal to
1 within the accuracy needed here, so lattice QCD is not
needed to provide a normalization. Lattice calculations
can help with the radiative correction factors though [21].
We cannot fully answer the unitarity question while
there is a new knot to untangle in the |Vud | story. Nevertheless there is another unresolved plot-line in the first
row, one where kaons are the main characters.
2.1.1 Decay constants
The ratio |Vus /Vud | can be precisely determined from measurements of the leptonic decays K → µν and π → µν,
combined with lattice QCD determinations of the decay
constants fK and fπ [22]. FLAG [1, 2] provides an extensive summary of many results for the decay constants.
There is good agreement among results, even comparing
2 + 1 flavor [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28] to 2 + 1 + 1 [29, 30, 31, 32].
After accounting for strong isospin the FLAG averages are
fK ± /fπ± = 1.1932(21)
fK ± /fπ± = 1.1917(37)

nf = 2 + 1 + 1
nf = 2 + 1 .

The agreement between individual lattice results is noteworthy considering the variety of lattice discretizations
used. Especially interesting is the comparison of 2 + 1 flavor results shown in Fig. 2, using the staggered [25] vs.
domain wall formulations [26]. This is a head-to-head test

[37], and twisted mass (diamond) [38] fermion actions.

[39] is superceded by [36].) In order to have an average
across several fermion discretization, it is useful to take the
average of these together, especially as effects of quenching
the charm quark should be small compared to the present
uncertainties. (Bear in mind that the nontrivial part of
the calculation is the difference 1 − f+ (0), presently determined with a 5% uncertainty.) Fig. 3 shows a weighted
average of the four results plotted
f+ (0) = 0.9692(15) .

(4)

There are also some recent results which are on their
way to meeting the FLAG criteria for inclusion in their
averages. JLQCD has studied the quark mass dependence
of f+ (0) using the overlap formulation for the quarks, so
far with just a single value of the lattice spacing [40]. Their
result is consistent with (4). PACS has performed a calculation with physical quark masses (nf = 2 + 1) on a
large volume at a single lattice spacing [41]. They use an
improved Wilson fermion discretization. Their result, after combining their errors is f+ (0) = 0.960(5), where the
largest uncertainty is due to discretization errors. As they
continue to finer lattice spacings, it will be interesting to
see if their central value remains low compared to the average (4).
As will be clear in the next section, there is renewed
scrutiny being placed on the SM prediction of |Vus | from
semileptonic K decay. One area yet to be addressed are
radiative corrections. Work has begun extending what has
been done for π + → π 0 e+ νe [21] to K → πℓν [42].
2.1.3 Summary

on independent gauge field configurations, using different
fermion and gauge discretizations, with both calculations
reaching uncertainties as small as 0.5%. They agree perfectly.
It appears from (2) that any effects due to quenching
the charm quark cancel in the ratio of decay constants, at
least at the few per-mille level. Nevertheless, in discussion
below, I will use the more precise 2+1+1 FLAG average.
The precision of the QCD matrix element is now comparable to the expected size of QED and other isospin
breaking effects. Radiative corrections have recently been
calculated on the lattice [33] and agree with the estimate
from chiral perturbation theory [34].

2.1.2 Semileptonic decay
In order to infer |Vus | from semileptonic decays K → πℓν,
lattice QCD determination of the form factor f+ (q 2 ) is
required. In fact, the kinematic dependence is fit by each
experiment separately and integrated, so all that is needed
is the normalization f+ (0). Experiments find consistent
|Vus |f+ (0) for these decays for charged and neutral kaons,
±
±
and for electron and muon final states, i.e. for Ke3
, Kµ3
,
L
L
S
Ke3 , Kµ3 , Ke3 (Table 66.1 of [12]).
Lattice results are available with nf = 2 + 1 flavors of
sea quarks [35, 37] and with 2+1+1 flavors [38, 36]. (Ref.

The heroes of first-row flavor physics have sent home some
tantalizing puzzles. This goes to show that even well-trod
paths such as β decays and (semi)leptonic π and K decays can lead to previously uncovered mysteries. With the
scales of uncertainty falling from our eyes, a tension is
revealed in the |Vud |-|Vus | plane (Figure 4).
There are really two questions to be asked regarding
the constraints in Figure 4. First, are two CKM parameters enough to describe the interactions of u quarks with d
and s quarks? Only if the answer is yes can we ask the second question, is the global fit to |Vud | and |Vus | consistent
with CKM unitarity?
The answer to the first question is clearly “no” at
present. There is no way to obtain a satisfactory fit to the
three classes of constraints shown. What is also clear is a
consistency in the |Vud | determinations; even with the disparate ranges of uncertainties, it seems implausible that
some change in theory or experiment would resolve the
tension by resulting in a |Vud | consistent with the intersection of the Kℓ3 and Kµ2 /πµ2 constraints. The question
is then whether further investigation will move the diagonal band down or the horizontal band up, or neither.
If we assume that the first row is dominated by SM
physics, even at the very precise level we have reached,
then unitarity constraints hint that the Kℓ3 constraint is
too low. Thus there is good cause to look more deeply into
the assumptions being made in those determinations.

RBC/UKQCD domain wall configurations is also in good
agreement [47].
An updated result for the ratio fDs /fD has been obtained using the domain wall formulation for all quarks
[48]. Another new calculation of charmed and ϕ meson decay constants [49], obtained using overlap valence fermions
on the RBC/UKQCD nf = 2 + 1 domain wall configurations has recently appeared, although the uncertainties are
not yet as precise as those above.

The horizontal band is the constraint from semileptonic K →
πℓν decay (Kℓ3 ) using (4) for f+ (0). The diagonal band is
the constraint from the ratio of leptonic decay rates of the K
or π to µνµ (Kµ2 /πµ2 ) and (2). The vertical bands are, from
narrowest to widest, the constraints from superallowed nuclear
decays, neutron β decay, and π + → π 0 e+ νe . The dotted curve
indicates values of |Vud | and |Vus | consistent with first row
unitarity.

2.2 Second row
In order to test second row CKM unitarity, primary focus
lies on |Vcd | and |Vcs |. |Vcb | is too small to be important
at the current level of precision. The quest for |Vcb | is the
subject of a later section.

2.2.1 Leptonic decays
A summary of experimental measurements of D(s) leptonic decays is given in §71.3 of [12]. One notable change
from the previous version [11] is that Sirlin’s electroweak
correction [43] has now been applied in inferring |Vcq |fDq
from the experimental branching fractions. This significantly reduces tension in the second row unitarity tests,
as we will see below.
There are two independent 2+1+1 flavor results, one
by ETM [30] and the other by Fermilab/MILC [31]. They
are in good agreement, though the precision of the latter
dominates any average. It is worth mentioning the good
agreement seen between different methods on configurations with 2+1 flavors of sea quarks. Particularly impressive is the agreement at the 1-2% level between the completely independent staggered computations [44, 45] and
the results using domain wall fermions [46]. A result for
fDs using overlap valence fermions on the nf = 2 + 1

Experimental data for semileptonic D decay is summarized by HFLAV [50].
The form factor f+ (0) for D → π provides a normalization for the corresponding semileptonic decay. There are
two results of comparable precision. The one by HPQCD
[51] is on previous generation MILC lattices with nf =
2 + 1, while a more recent one by ETM [52] is on their
nf = 2 + 1 + 1 twisted mass configurations. The central
values differ by about 10%, which is 2σ. Effects of quenching the charm are negligible compared to this, so it is safest
to average these, inflating the uncertainty by the square
root of the χ2 per degree-of-freedom, obtaining
D→π
f+
(0) = 0.644(27) .

(5)

The uncertainty here will improve if the preliminary result from Fermilab/MILC [53] of f+ (0) = 0.625(17)(13) is
confirmed.
In summer talks, HPQCD presented a new, preliminary result for |Vcs |, using the MILC nf = 2 + 1 + 1
configurations and fitting the full D → Kℓν form factor
f+ (q 2 ) along with the experimental data [54]. This new
result is in good agreement with the previous best determination, the HPQCD result of 2013 obtained on MILC’s
nf = 2 + 1 lattices, |Vcs | = 0.963(5)expt (14)latt [55]. The
ETM collaboration have a 2 + 1 + 1 flavor calculation as
well; using their f+ (0) leads to |Vcs | = 0.970(33) [52, 56];
this is the result adopted by FLAG [1, 2]. Other |Vcs | results on nf = 2 + 1 lattices are HPQCD’s earlier determination using the D → K form factor f+ (0) [57] to normalize the experimental data as well as Meinel’s Λc → Λℓ+ µℓ
form factors [58] combined with BESIII branching fractions [59, 60]. Preliminary results for the D → K form
factor at q 2 = 0 were also reported by Fermilab/MILC in
[53].
HPQCD recently completed form factor calculations
for Bc → Bd,s ℓν decay [61]. When experimental measurements are made of these branching fractions, this will lead
to a novel method for determining |Vcd |, |Vcs |, or their ratio – one where the b quark is a spectator. In addition to
the novelty of the spectator b, this paper is the first to
jointly analyze correlation functions obtained with both
NRQCD and heavy-HISQ formulations for the b quark.

and is perfectly consistent with second-row unitarity. The
second row heroes seem to have made several complete
and successful journeys. The discoveries they have brought
home have not been revolutionary, but they are nonetheless impressive in their precision and consistency. Their
stories offer hope that the struggles of other heroes still at
sea can be overcome.
2.3 Third row
The third row heroes have often been the oddsmakers’ favorite to return from the abyss triumphant with discovery
of New Physics. In large part this is because direct determinations of |Vtd | and |Vts | come from loop-mediated processes in the Standard Model. This SM suppression leaves
room for BSM physics to reveal itself. The most precise
measurements here are of the neutral B 0 and Bs0 meson
mass differences, respectively ∆Md and ∆Ms , measured
as oscillation frequencies. In the following I use the experimental averages from PDG 2018 [11].
In the past few years, new lattice results have been
forthcoming, not only for the matrix element needed for

5

Standard Model predictions of the mass differences, but
for matrix elements of the full set of five dimension-6 operators which enter the ∆B = 2 effective Hamiltonian.
These come from lattice ensembles with sea quark content nf = 2 (ETM [62]), 2 + 1 (Fermilab/MILC [31]),
and 2 + 1 + 1 (HPQCD [63]). The ETM calculation uses
the twisted-mass formulation for all quarks. The other
two groups use staggered fermions (Asqtad and HISQ, respectively) for the light and strange, and the Fermilab or
NRQCD formulations, respectively for the bottom quark.
There is also a recent calculation of the SU(3)-breaking
ratios by the RBC/UKQCD collaboration [48], using domain wall quarks (for all flavors) on configurations with
nf = 2 + 1 flavor of sea quarks.
Within uncertainties, there is generally good agreement for the matrix elements, except that the ETM results for the two (S − P )(S + P ) operators (color-diagonal
and color-mixed) are low compared to the other results.
While the size of the effect of quenching the strange quark
is not known, the discrepancy could also be due to the
specific RI-MOM scheme used to compute renormaliza0
tion factors. A similar discrepancy in K 0 − K̄ operators
was recently studied and resolved [64, 65]. Very briefly,
condensate contributions can contaminate the gauge-fixed
Green’s functions, but the infrared behavior can be better
controlled with careful choice of kinematics.
Figure 6 shows what the lattice results (with the strange
quark unquenched), combined with the experimental measurements, imply for |Vtd | and |Vts |. Because of correlations and canceling uncertainties, the SM predictions for
the ratio ∆Ms /∆Md is more precise than for numerator
or denominator individually. Hexagons correspond to 1σ
variations in |Vtd | and |Vts | and their ratio. I’ve performed
a fit to |Vts | and |Vts /Vtd | from each group (where available), with 1σ and 2σ contours shown, obtaining
|Vtd | = 8.38(17) × 10−3
|Vts | = 40.9(8) × 10
|Vts /Vtd | = 4.88(4) .

The ∆B = 2 matrix elements have recently also been
computed using sum rules [67], in very good agreement
with lattice results.
In addition to matrix elements of the dimension-6 operators, the SM prediction for the Bs −B̄ s width difference
∆Γs has been improved by having lattice-determined matrix elements of dimension-7 operators [68].

2.4 Third column
The |Vxb | heroes have been adventuring in the unknown
for a long time. They send messages home, sometimes full
of hope and other times of puzzlement. They have suffered
from bouts of infighting which have thankfully subsided,
aided by regular peace talks and occasional joint ventures

A new b → u decay which could be measured by LHCb
is Bc → Dℓν [79]. HPQCD is working on Bc → Dℓν form
factors, with the rare Bc → Ds form factors as warm up
[80].
Gambino & Hashimoto have a proposal to address inclusive decays on the lattice [81]. Given the longstanding
discrepancy between inclusive and exclusive determinations of |Vub |, any new line of attack is welcome.
In addition to the vector and scalar form factors, the
tensor form factor has also now been computed, allowing
complete a SM prediction for the rare decay B → πℓ+ ℓ−
[82], currently in agreement with the first experimental
observation [83].

CKM fit to tree-level observables [66] (see [63]). The dotted

only |Vtb |.

2.4.1 Semileptonic b → u decays
The most precise determination of |Vub | using an exclusive
semileptonic decay comes from B → πℓν. Because of the
expense to extrapolate or compute with the final-state meson at the physical quark mass point, progress takes time.
The complete lattice calculations ready to be included in
global averages date from 2015 or earlier. The FLAG review [1] includes lattice results on nf = 2 + 1 lattices
of Ref. [69, 70, 71]. These use either staggered fermions or
domain wall fermions for the light quark, and NRQCD,
the Fermilab formulation, or the Columbia RHQ action
for the b quark. All of those results come from ensembles
of gauge field configurations including the effects of 2 + 1
flavors of sea quarks. Using the BCL parametrization [72],
FLAG perform a joint fit to lattice form factor data and
binned experimental differential decay rates from BaBar
[73,74] and Belle [75, 76]. Their result is
|Vub | = 3.73(14) × 10−3 .

(11)

Progress on the next generation calculations is evident. HPQCD have used the NRQCD-HISQ formulation
with MILC HISQ lattices, including physically light pion
2
masses, to show that the soft pion theorem f+ (qmax
) =
fB /fπ holds in the chiral limit [77]. Last year JLQCD
presented preliminary results for B → π form factors using Mobius domain wall fermions for all quarks, with the
systematic uncertainties still being quantified [78].

The B meson decay constant has been computed by many
groups over the years. FLAG provides a useful summary
[1]. Since 2013 the most precise results have been obtained
on lattices with 2+1+1 flavors of sea quarks. In 2017
there was a significant reduction in the uncertainty by the
Fermilab/MILC lattice collaborations [31]. This reduction
comes from using the HISQ formulation for all quark flavors; the renormalization of the lattice axial current is determined fully nonperturbatively. The Fermilab/MILC results are in good agreement with other 2+1+1 flavor calculations [29, 84, 85]. Of these other determinations, two use
nonrelativistic b quarks on MILC’s HISQ-action lattices,
while the third uses the twisted mass action for all quarks.
Thus, we see consistency among the approaches, extrapolating HISQ and twisted quark actions to the physical b
limit compared to use of NRQCD. Any weighted average
of the results is dominated by Fermilab/MILC [31].
The experimental results for B − → τ − ν̄ are not very
precise presently, in large part due to the small branching
fractions and the difficult final state. BaBar [86, 87] and
Belle [88, 89] both have results with two tagging methods,
hadronic and semileptonic. However the experiments disagree with each other, with Belle results lower and BaBar
results higher. None of these measurements have reached
5σ significance. FLAG has averaged these results, inflating
the uncertainty to account for the discrepancy [1], yielding a 30% determination of the branching fraction. The
|Vub | they infer from this average along with the 2 + 1 + 1
flavor fB is |Vub | = 4.05(3)(64) × 10−3 . With this large
uncertainty, this mode does not yet add much information about |Vub |. Belle II aims to reduce the uncertainty
on the B → τ ν branching fraction to approximately 15%
with 5 ab−1 of data and to 5% with 50 ab−1 [90], so there
is hope for the future.
2.4.3 Semileptonic b → c decays
From a lattice QCD point of view, the most straightforward route to |Vcb | is through B → Dℓν decay. The
initial and final pseudoscalar states are stable to strong
interactions, and the Standard Model prediction for the
decay, with ℓ = e or µ, requires just one form factor,

f+ (q 2 ). Lattice data come from [91, 92]. FLAG [1] combines these results with experimental data in a joint fit to
infer |Vcb | = 0.0401(10) from B → Dℓν decay.
Experimentally, however, B → Dℓν decay measurements are susceptible to relatively large systematic uncertainties due to the background from B → D∗ ℓν, with the
D∗ subsequently decaying to Dπ. Using experimental data
for B → D∗ ℓν has been the more precise method of determining |Vcb | from exclusive decays. Until recently, the
experimental data for the differential decay rate and angular variables has been fit to kinematic functions known
as the CLN parametrization [93]. In this case the only
information needed from lattice QCD is the normalization, taken from calculations of the axial vector current
matrix element at the zero-recoil kinematic point, h+ (1).
Although the D∗ decays strongly, its width is narrow and
heavy meson chiral perturbation theory gives some guidance.
There was some excitement when Belle published some
unfolded data [94], allowing the community to try different kinematic parametrizations. For a time it looked like
removing some assumptions present in CLN, by using the
BGL parametrization, for example, would resolve the tension between the B → D∗ ℓν and inclusive decay determinations of |Vcb | [95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100]. However, the tension
remains today. For a more detailed, recent review of the
|Vcb | puzzle see [101].
Progress will be made with new lattice and experiment
produce new results. Lattice collaborations are aiming for
a full set of form factors for B → D∗ ℓν decay, so that the
q 2 dependence can informed by both lattice and experimental data [102, 103]. Because the light spectator quark
is expensive, results for decays with heavier spectators,
i.e. Bc → (J/ψ)ℓν [104] and Bs → Ds∗ ℓν [105, 106] form
factors are milestones along the way.
In addition to being able to infer CKM matrix elements, one also wants to firm up the Standard Model predictions [91, 92, 107] for lepton flavor universality violating
ratios [108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114]. That said, resolution or confirmation of those anomalies is more likely to
occur from reducing experimental uncertainties.
There is no prospect for measuring leptonic Bc decays in the near future. Nevertheless, lattice calculations
of the decay constant fBc are still welcome. HPQCD, using heavy HISQ b and c on MILC’s 2+1 flavor lattices,
found fBc = 427(6) MeV [115] and, while using NRQCD
b and HISQ c on MILC’s 2+1+1 flavor HISQ lattices,
found 434(15) MeV [116]. In 2018 the European Twisted
Mass Collaboration gave a preliminary value for fBc [117]
which is 2σ lower than the HPQCD results; however, a
proper comparison awaits their finalized result. It would
be good for fBc to be computed using other actions on
other configurations. These allow a test of heavy quark
formulations among other things, and is one of the simplest matrix elements involving a c̄Γ b current which can
be computed in lattice QCD.

2.4.4 Ratios
A few years ago saw a novel determination of the ratio
|Vub /Vcb | using the ratio of Λb decays Λb → pℓν relative to
Λb → Λc ℓν [118, 119]. While the experimental and lattice
errors are comparable, the lattice determinations could be
improved by calculations with larger volumes and lighter
sea quark masses.
Very recently LHCb measured Bs0 → K − µ+ νµ relative
to Bs0 → Ds− µ+ νµ .[120]. Combined with corresponding
form factors from lattice QCD (or sum rules) leads to another determination of |Vub /Vcb |. The Bs → Kℓν form factors have been calculated by several groups: FNAL/MILC
[121], HPQCD [122], and RBC/UKQCD [71], and Bs →
Ds ℓν most recently by HPQCD [123]. (RBC/UKQCD presented a preliminary update recently [124].) For the Bs →
Kµν decay, LHCb have divided the branching fraction
into two bins. Since the lattice data are most reliable at
low recoil, I focus on the q 2 > 7 GeV2 bin. The quantity
needed from lattice is thus IK (7 GeV2 )/IDs (m2µ ) where

and t− = (MBs − MP )2 . Fig. 7 shows the results using
the form factor fits from each of the three collaborations.
FLAG [2] has combined the lattice data and found they
can obtain a good fit, despite the tension apparent in
Fig. 7.
One should keep in mind that the spatial momentum
of the K in the lattice correlation functions generally corresponds to q 2 ⩾ 17 GeV2 . Thus the integration down
to 7 GeV2 involves an extrapolation of the lattice fits.
In the case of calculations using nonrelativistic b quarks
[122], this extrapolation goes in the direction where the
effective theory is worsening. The underlying assumption
of a clear separation of scales between QCD physics and
the b quark mass. This has been shown to work well for
many matrix elements, including form factors in the low
recoil regime, where ΛQCD /mb ≈ 0.1 is the relevant ratio.

8

Matthew Wingate: Quark flavor physics and lattice QCD

However, as q 2 is decreased from 17 GeV2 to 7 GeV2 the
spatial kaon momentum increases from 1 GeV to 2 GeV.
This means that |pK |/mb is growing, spoiling the separation of scales. Operators which may be negligible in the
low recoil regime can develop large matrix elements. For

Since lattice data are being used for both Bs → Kℓν
and Bs → Ds ℓν form factors, it is sensible to ask whether
there are correlations which need to be taken into account.
This ratio of decays Bs → Kℓν to Bs → Ds ℓν was specifically addressed in [125]. They performed a simultaneous
fit to their lattice data, publishing the full covariance matrix for their form factor shape parameters. Using these
to compute IK (7 GeV2 )/IDs (m2µ ) gives a 22% correlation
between numerator and denominator.

2.4.5 Summary

Figure 8 summarizes the situation with the third column
of the CKM matrix. the solid (dashed) curve depicts the
1σ (2σ) contours. A decent fit is obtained when including
the constraints from the exclusive semileptonic decays (as
well as the weak constraint from leptonic B decay). The
fit results are
|Vcb | = 39.4(6) × 10−3

(13)

|Vub | = 3.61(12) × 10−3 .

(14)

Unfortunately we cannot expect our |Vxb | heroes to return until the discrepancy with the determinations from
inclusive decays is better understood.

|Vub| × 103

The fact that FLAG find a good combined fit to the
published lattice data suggests that the quoted lattice uncertainties hold well in the kinematic regime where the
calculations are done. Further investigation into the extrapolations to lower q 2 is needed. In addition to issues
with using NRQCD away from low recoil, there are different methods for disentangling the physical q 2 dependence
of the form factors from lattice spacing and quark mass
dependencies. These should be yield consistent results, but
if they do not, then this needs to be understood. Finally,
greater scrutiny could be given to the effect of imposing
the constraint f+ (0) = f0 (0) in fits to the lattice data.
Since we expect errors to grow as we extrapolate from high
to low q 2 , the fits should tolerate some deviation from this
equality. After all, in most cases we are more interested in
the accuracy of the form factors in the medium-to-large
q 2 region than in tightly enforcing equality at q 2 = 0.

3 Rare processes
3.1 Rare kaon processes
3.1.1 Direct CP violation in K → ππ
Consider the decays of neutral kaons to two pions. The
0
weak, or flavor, eigenstates |K 0 ⟩ and |K̄ ⟩ map into each
other under a CP transformation. One can form CP eigenstates |K1 ⟩ and |K2 ⟩ as linear combinations of the weak
eigenstates. Only the CP-even eigenstate can decay to two
pions.
The mass eigenstates |KS ⟩ and |KL ⟩ are not pure CP
eigenstates. One is longer-lived than the other, with the
KS decaying almost always to π + π − or π 0 π 0 and the KL
decaying to a variety of other modes, notably to 3 pions.
However, the KL also occasionally decays to 2 pions. The
relevant ratios of matrix elements of the weak Hamiltonian
HW are defined as follows:
⟨π + π − |HW |KL ⟩
≈ ε + ε′
⟨π + π − |HW |KS ⟩
⟨π 0 π 0 |HW |KL ⟩
= 0 0
≈ ε − 2ε′ .
⟨π π |HW |KS ⟩

η+− =

(15)

If the only source of CP violation came from mixing, then
we would have η+− = η00 ≈ ε, so ε′ quantifies what is
called “direct CP violation.” In fact experiments measure

RBC/UKQCD have recently published a new result for
ε′ /ε [128]. This updates their previous result [129] which
found a value 2σ below the experimental value. That work
also gave a phase shift for the I = 0 channel which was in
significant disagreement with a dispersive analysis [130].
The updated work substantially improves the analysis of
the lattice ππ correlation functions. By tripling the statistics and using a larger set of interpolating operators, the
authors were able to conclude that their previous correlation functions possessed larger-than-expected contamination from excited states.
Their new result is Re(ε′ /ε) = 2.17(26)(62)(50)×10−3 ,
where the uncertainties are respectively due to statistics,
isospin-conserving systematic errors, and omitted isospin
breaking effects. This is now compatible with (16). They
also give a new result for

and are reported to be aiming for a 10% measurement
eventually [138]. It is timely for lattice QCD to determine
these nonlocal contributions. In their recent paper [138]
have carried out a calculation with quark masses corresponding to nearly physical pion mass. They investigated
several effects, such as momentum dependence, the contributions from disconnected diagrams, and their ability to
control unphysical effects. The results look promising so
far, and it looks like they may be able to continue onward
toward a determination of the required amplitude, at least
at one kinematic point.

3.2 Rare b decays

With the many new measurements of b → s decays in
the past 5-10 years, there are some exciting deviations
from Standard Model predictions. Among these are a ≈ 3σ
disagreement between experiment and SM theory in the
B → K ∗ µ+ µ− angular observable P5′ [139, 140] and the ratios R(K (∗) ) [141, 142, 143, 144], of B → K (∗) ℓ+ ℓ− modes
with muon- versus electron-pair in the final state. Lattice
QCD is not needed for these theory calculations. However, LQCD determinations of the B → K [145, 146, 147],
B → K ∗ , and Bs → ϕ form factors [148, 149] help determine the differential decay rates. The experimental decay
rates [150, 151] are a bit lower than the SM predictions
taken with the assumption that the lattice form factors
are the full story. It is intriguing that the same extension

both resolve the P5′ discrepancy and lower the theory prewhere the denominator comes from [131].

4 Conclusion
These are just a few tales of the flavor physics heroes.
Tests of the CKM paradigm invariably receive the most
attention. There is much work going on behind the scenes
as well, improving methods and testing assumptions.
One of the best things about the International Symposia on Lattice Field Theory is the format, where plenary sessions are complemented by many parallel sessions.
Through these and the poster session, one appreciates
the breadth and depth of research which advances flavor
physics, hadron physics more broadly, and physics beyond
the Standard Model. It was a shame to have lost that in
2020. Colleagues should be applauded for their efforts to
fill the gap with virtual meetings on a smaller scale and
with this volume. All this experience will undoubtedly be
applied to making the MIT virtual Lattice 2021 a success.
Even so, I look forward to seeing you in person at the
next opportunity, perhaps in Bonn for Lattice 2022 if not
sooner. Bis wir uns wieder treffen.
