Abstract.
The aim of the paper is to describe a model of the development of the
Covid-19 contamination of the population of a country or a region. For this
purpose a special branching process with two types of individuals is considered.
This model is intended to use only the observed daily statistics to estimate
the main parameter of the contamination and to give a prediction of the mean
value of the non-observed population of the contaminated individuals. This is a
serious advantage in comparison with other more complicated models where the
observed official statistics are not sufficient. In this way the specific development
of the Covid-19 epidemics is considered for different countries.

1. Introduction.
Nowadays the Theory of Branching Processes is a powerful tool for modeling
the development of populations whose members have an ability of reproduction
following some stochastic laws. The objects may be of different types and physical nature. From nuclear reaction and cosmic rays to cell proliferation and
digital information, branching stochastic models are used to explain very interesting real-world stochastic phenomena. Branching processes have serious
applications in Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Medicine, Demography, Epidemiology, Economics an so on. The basic models and analytical results are
presented in many books and a lot of papers. We would like to point out the
monographs [1 − 5] among the others. Some applications of branching processes
in Biology and Medicine are presented in [4] and [6]. Some basic estimation
problems are considered in [7].
The aim of the present paper is to describe an adequate model of the development of the Covid-19 contamination in the population. For this purpose
a special branching process with two types of contaminated individuals is constructed and considered day by day. In this way we are able to use the observed
statistics of the Covid-19 daily registered contaminated individuals and to estimate the main parameter of contamination. In fact this parameter m represents the mean value of the contaminated individuals by one individual per
day. Using the observed statistics some methods for estimation are proposed
and the corresponding graphics are presented. In this way we are able to give a
prediction of the possible development of the mean value of the contaminated
individuals. The modeling and estimation is performed for Bulgaria and some
other countries: Italy, France, Germany, Spain globally. Of course, the model
can be applied to any other country or region. In the paper the results are
1

presented in detail for Bulgaria, Italy and globally. Results for other countries,
additional information, reports and plots, related to this research can be found
on http://ir-statistics.net/covid-19.
The theoretical model is described in detail in Section 2. The p.g.f.’s and
the mathematical expectations are obtained. Regardless of its simplicity the
model has a great advantage using only the observed official statistics of the
lab-confirmed cases. The estimation problems are presented in Section 3. Some
conclusive remarks are given in Section 4.
2 Two-type branching process as a model of Covid-19 population
dynamics.
What can be observed? - Only that part of the contaminated individuals
who became ill or who are discovered as a result of medical tests. Every day only
the statistics of this registered part of all contaminated individuals is available.
To describe this situation we can consider a two type branching process
{Z1 (n), Z2 (n)} where type T1 are contaminated (but still healthy) individuals
who don’t know that they are Covid-19 infected and type T2 of discovered with
Covid-19 virus individuals (and this is our real statistics). Every individual of
type T1 (contaminated) produces per day a random number of new individuals
of type T1 (contaminated) or only one individual of type T2 (more precisely, in
this case the individual type T1 is transformed into an individual type T2 ). Note
that T2 is a final type, i.e. the individuals of this type don’t take part in the
further evolution of the process because they are isolated under the quarantine.

Let ξ1 = (ξ1 , ξ2 ) be the offspring vector of type T1 . Then the offspring
joint probability generating function (p.g.f.) of type T1 can be defined as follows:
ξ

j=1

pj sj1 + qs2 , q = 1 −

Pk

j=0

pj , h1 (1, 1) = 1,

where | s1 | ≤ 1, |s2 | ≤ 1.
Obviously h2 (s1 , s2 ) ≡ 1 because type T2 has (0, 0) offspring.
Note that p0 is the probability that type T1 goes out of the reproduction
process (the individual becomes healthy or goes out of the country, i.e. emigrates), pj is the probability to produce new j contaminated individuals of type
T1 and q is the probability that the individual type T1 is confirmed ill (or dead).
In other words, q = P{T1 → T2 }, i.e. with probability q an individual of type
T1 is transformed into an individual of type T2 . One can obtain also that the
marginal p.g.f. are

E(s22 ) = h1 (1, s2 ) = 1 − q + qs2 .
If we assume that Z1 (0) > 0 and Z2 (0) = 0 then for n = 1, 2, ...
PZ1 (n−1) (1)
Z1 (n) = j=1

where the vectors {(ξ1 (n; j), ξ2 (n; j)} are independent and identically dis(1) (1)
tributed (iid) as (ξ1 , ξ2 ).

Interpretation: Z1 (n) is the total number of individuals (type T1 ) in the
n-th day contaminated by the individuals of the (n − 1)-th day; Z2 (n) is the
total number of the registered with Covid-19 individuals (type T2 ) in the n-th
day. The process starts with Z1 (0) contaminated individuals, where
Z1 (0) can
P∞
be an integer-valued random variable with a p.g.f. h0 (s) = EsZ0 = k=1 p0k sk ,
|s| ≤ 1, or Z0 = N for some integer value, N = 1, 2, ... . The random variable
(1)
ξ1 (n; j) is the number of contaminated individuals (type T1 ) in the n-th day
infected by the j-th contaminated individual from the (n − 1)-th day, j =
(1)
1, 2, ..., Z1 (n − 1). Similarly the random variable ξ2 (n; j) is the number of the
confirmed contaminated individuals (type T2 ) in the n-th day transformed by
the j-th contaminated individual from the (n − 1)-th day, j = 1, 2, ..., Z1 (n − 1).
(1)
(1)
Note that P{ξ2 (n; j) = 0} = 1 − q and P{ξ2 (n; j) = 1} = q. Hence
Z2 (n) ∈ Bi(Z1 (n − 1, q), i.e.
P{Z2 (n) = i|Z1 (n − 1) = l} = (li )q i (1 − q)l−i , i = 0, 1, ..., l; l = 0, 1, 2, ...
In other words the probability q can be interpreted as a proportion of the
confirmed individuals in the day n among all contaminated individuals in the
day n − 1.
Let h0 (s) = EsZ1 (0) , F1 (n; s) = E(sZ1 (n) ), F2 (n; s) = E(sZ2 (n) ). Introduce
the following p.g.f.
Pk
h∗ (s) = h1 (s, 1) = q + p0 + j=1 pj sj , e
h(s) = h1 (1, s) = 1 − q + qs.
Then it is not difficult to check that for n = 0, 1, 2, ..., we are able to obtain
the p.g.f. of the process:
F1 (n; s) = E(sZ1 (n) ) = F1 (n−1; h∗ (s)) = F1 (0; h∗n (s)) = h0 (h∗ (h∗ (...(h∗ (s))...))),
F2 (n; s) = E(sZ2 (n) ) = F1 (n − 1; e
h(s)) = F1 (0; e
hn (s)) = h0 (e

d e
ds h(s)|s=1 = Eξ2 = q is the mean value of the registered contaminated indid
viduals by one c.i. Introduce also m0 = EZ1 (0) = ds
h0 (s)|s=1 . Therefore
n
M1 (n) = EZ1 (n) = m0 m , n = 0, 1, 2, ...,
M2 (n) = EZ2 (n) = qEZ1 (n − 1) = qm0 mn−1 , n = 1, 2, ...; EZ2 (0) = 0.
Note that we can observe only Z2 (1), Z2 (2), ..., Z2 (n).
What can be estimated with these observations?
2 (n+1)

Note first that EZ

as
EZ2 (n)

an estimator of the parameter m (similar to Lotka-Nagaev estimator for the
classical BGW branching process). It is possible to use also the following Harris
type estimator

mn,N = i=n+1 Z2 (i)/ j==n Z2 (j), n = 1, 2, ...; N = 1, 2, ....
See [7] for more details.
Estimating m we are able to predict the mean value of the contaminated

(non observed) individuals in the population. In the case when we assume that
Z1 (0) = 1 then M1 (n) = EZ1 (n) can be approximated respectively by m
b nn , or
n

e n , or mn,N . In fact it means that we can obtain three types of estimators
c1 (n) = m
f1 (n) = m
M
b nn , M
e nn and M 1 (n) = mnn,N .
In other words we could say that we have at least three prognostic lines.
Therefore if we have observations (Z2 (1), Z2 (2), ..., Z2 (n)) over the first n days,
we are able to predict the mean value of the contaminated individuals for the
next k days by the relations:
c1 (n + k) = m
f1 (n + k) = m
M
b n+k

e nn+k and M 1 (n + k) = mn+k
n
n,N , k = 1, 2, ...
We are able to estimate also the proportion α(n) of the registered contaminated individuals among the population in the n-th day. Then we can
c1 (n)},
obtain the following three types of estimators: α
b(n) = Z2 (n)/{Z2 (n) + M
f1 (n)}, α(n) = Z2 (n)/{Z2 (n) + M 1 (n)}.
α
e(n) = Z2 (n)/{Z2 (n) + M
All obtained estimators will be presented by the observed registered labconfirmed cases in the next section. The quality of the estimation, however,
depends on the representativeness of the sample due to the specifics of the data
collection in each country.
Comment. For more detailed investigation and simulation the following
models can be applied in the considered situation:
Pk
(i) h∗ (s) = q + p0 + p1 s + p2 s2 + ... + pk sk , where q = 1 − j=0 pj and
pj , j = 0, 1, ..., k, can be specially
P∞ chosen for k = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
(ii) h∗ (s) = q + p0 + k=1 (1 − p)pk sk = q + p0 + (1 − p)ps)/(1 − ps),
where q + p0 = 1 − p. It is possible to consider also the restricted geometrical
distribution up to some k = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
P∞
k
(iii) h∗ (s) = q + p0 + k=1 e−λ λk! sk = q + p0 + e−λ(1−s) − e−λ , where
−λ
q + p0 = e . Similarly it is possible to consider also the restricted Poisson
distribution up to some k = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
Note that the parameters of these distributions can be set in the manner that
d ∗
e nn , or mnn,N . Then with this individual distrih
(s)|s=1 is equal to m
b nn , or m
ds
butions it is possible to simulate the trajectories of the non-observed process of
contamination for further studies.
3. Estimation and prediction.
We would like to point out once again that the considered in Section 2 model
is versitile but the application in each country is specific because it depends
essentially on the official data from the country. The plots and tables below
illustrate well some specific details for different countries as well as the common
trend.
The data used for the estimation of the parameters of the model come from
the official World Health Organization (WHO) situation reports [10].
We apply the here defined model. Note that the observed data is the number
of the newly (daily) registered individuals denoted by Z2 (n). The data about
the new number of infected individuals (denoted by Z1 (n)) is unobservable. The
initial number m0 = EZ1 (0) is also unknown. Here n is the corresponding day
from the beginning of the contamination.
The estimation can be summarized in the following steps.

New registered

Total

Figure 1: Raw data for infected globally
1. On the basis of each sample Z2 (1), . . . , Z2 (s), s = 1, . . . , n, the mean
numbers of the new infected individuals by one contaminated individual is
estimated by the Harris, Lotka-Nagaev and Crump-Hove type estimators
considered above.
The dynamics of these parameters over time is studied and for the forecasting purposes the most recent value is used.
2. The mean values of the expected number of nonregistered contaminated
individuals are calculated for the three types of estimators.
Note that M1 (s + k) = m0 ms+k = M1 (s)mk . Instead of m0 we estimate
M1 (s) by the registered contaminated individuals in day s. Here s depends
on the data set and k = n − s, . . . , n.
3. The proportion α(s + k) of the registered contaminated individuals among
the population of all infected in the s + k-th day is estimated.
We will demonstrate the approach described above with the data of the
reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 daily cases globally, in Italy and in
Bulgaria.
On Figure 1 one can see the original data for the newly reported and for the
total number of registered cases globally.
The dynamics of the Harris, Lotka-Nagaev and Crump-Hove estimators can
be followed on Figure 2.
The Harris estimator shows a relatively more stable behaviour during the
period. The three estimates exhibit similar asymptotics.
The next step is to calculate the mean values of the expected number of nonregistered contaminated individuals for the three types of estimators, starting
with s = 20 (Figure 3). The last five points on the graph after day 20 represent
the forecast for the next 5 days.

The corresponding values of the proportion of the registered individuals
among the contaminated population is presented on Figure 4
For the registered cases in Italy the raw data can be seen on the Figures 5 8 below.
Note that the newly confirmed contaminated individuals in Bulgaria are
reported day by day, starting from 08.03.2020 as:
4; 0; 2; 1; 16; 8; 10; 10; 11; 19; 11; 18; 17; 36; 22; 16; 19; 22; 22; 29; 38
In fact these data form the sample (Z2 (1), Z2 (2), ..., Z2 (20)), where now n =
20, i.e. 20 days from thePfirst confirmed contaminated individuals. We use
k
also the statistics U (k) = j=1 Z2 (j), k = 1, 2, ..., 17, whose values are given as

The two samples are presented on Figure 9.
The estimated mean number of infected individuals for the three types of
estimators is presented on Figure 10, the estimated expected number of contaminated individuals (with s = 10, chosen on the basis of the shorter time period
of contamination) can be seen on Figure 11 and the estimated α - on Figure 12.
The values of the Harris estimator at the end of the contamination period
for the three datasets considered above can be found in Table 1
Up to day 20 the Harris estimator (for Bulgaria) is 1.1093 (i.e. slightly

supercritical), the expected number of newly infected and still not registered
individuals is appr. 31, the actual reported registered is 38, hence the estimated
proportion of the registered individuals among the infected is α = 0.5507.
To approve the behaviour of the model one can compare the predicted number of confirmed individuals Z̃2 (n − k) (using the Harris estimator m̃n ) for the
period of k days before the latest date in the data set with the actually observed
values of Z2 (n). The corresponsing values, as well as the 95% confidence interval
of the forecast are presented on Table 2.
Additionaly, using the data, provided by WHO the comparison between the
behaviour of the process under different local conditions with a approximatelly
same contamination period. For example on the Figure 13 the Harris estimator
globally, for Italy, Germany and France are compared.
As mentioned earlier the mean number of new contaminated individuals by
one c.i. tends to values close, but greater than 1 as the time of contamination
increases.
Calculating the proportions α of the confirmed contaminated individuals
among the four populations with s = 20 (presented on Figure 14) one can
see that α’s vary largely but stay relatively high, especially at the end of the
contamination period. This fact can be considered as a result of different types
of actions, undertaken to restrict the spread of the infection.
4. Concluding remarks.
First of all the estimation of the mean value of reproduction m allows us
to classify the contamination process as supercritical (m > 1), critical (m = 1)
and subcritical (m < 1). In the supercritical case the mean population growth
is exponential, in the critical case the mean value of the population is constant
and in the subcritical case the decreasing of the mean population is exponential.

Figure 14: The proportion of the registered individuals in the last 20 days
Up to the moment of our investigation the estimated mean number of new
contaminated individuals (for Bulgaria) is slightly greater than 1 which corresponds to the exponential growth of the contaminated population, globally and
locally in specific countries and regions.
Finally the estimating of the mean parameter of contamination can be considered as a first stage to construction of a more complicated epidemiological
model. As a such model for example, one can use a branching process with random migration considered in [8-9] or some other model of controlled branching
processes (see [5]).
