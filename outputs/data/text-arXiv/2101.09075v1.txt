ABSTRACT
Mobile contact tracing apps are – in principle – a perfect aid to condemn the human-to-human spread of an infectious disease such as
COVID-19 due to the wide use of smartphones worldwide. Yet, the
unknown accuracy of contact estimation by wireless technologies
hinders the broad use. We address this challenge by conducting
a measurement study with a custom testbed to show the benefits
and limitations of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in comparison to
distance estimation by ultra-wideband (UWB). Our results confirm that BLE-based distance estimation is not sufficient in real
scenarios where smartphones are shielded heavily by the users’
bodies. Yet, multi-path signal propagation reduces the effect of body
shielding. Finally, we demonstrate that UWB is more robust to the
environment than BLE.

INTRODUCTION

Contact tracing aims at fighting human-to-human infection spreading by identifying – and isolating – persons who were in close
contact to an infected person. Quarantine is one of the most effective measures to break infection chains [6]. To support time-intense
manual contact tracing, mobile contact tracing apps have been
introduced that estimate and capture contacts.
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is currently seen as the most promising wireless technology for contact detection [9]. The spatial distance between two smartphones is estimated based on the received
signal strength (RSSI – received signal strength indicator), which is
known to be challenged by non line-of-sight (LOS) conditions such

as shielding by human bodies and multi-path propagation. It has
been shown that BLE RSSI based distance estimation is difficult and
that additional concepts are needed to increase accuracy [7]. Ultrawideband (UWB) based distance calculation uses time-of-flight
(ToF) measures and may be considered as an alternative technology
for contact tracing or as a means for ground-truth measurement.
Yet, UWB is currently only available in a few flagship smartphones
such as Samsung Galaxy Note 20 or Apple iPhone 11.
The focus of this paper rests on providing insights into BLE RSSI
based distance estimation in comparison to UWB-based distance
measurement. We make the following contributions:
• We introduce an efficient measurement method and mobile
app that allows to capture BLE and UWB-based distance
estimates, the latter via external UWB modules connected
to the smartphone.
• We provide quantitative results of BLE RSSI and UWB ToF
distance measurements in an anechoic chamber (comparable
to outdoor scenarios), LOS indoors, and in a corner scenario
indoors with varying phone carrying positions. Our results
confirm that using BLE RSSI for distance estimation is challenging, similar to [7]. Further, we find that BLE multi-path
propagation can reduce body shielding effects and show that
UWB ToF is a more robust distance estimation method than
BLE RSSI based derivation.

RELATED WORK

BLE is widely used in mobile contact tracing apps currently promoted by health authorities worldwide. To unify and support contact tracing apps, the Google/Apple API for exposure notification
based on BLE has been proposed for iOS1 and Android2 platforms.
These APIs notify users about exposures to infected people according to commonly agreed thresholds (too close, too long) while
preserving privacy to a high degree. The Google/Apple notification API has been widely adopted in contact tracing apps [9]. Yet,
BLE-based distance estimation is error-prone. The study presented
in [8] shows that staged contacts in a tram (less than 2 m, longer
than 15 minutes) do not lead to expected notifications of the API
when using the contact tracing app of Switzerland or Germany, and

BLE RSSI Transformation

BLE RSSI values are recorded on the smartphones as obtained
through the getRSSI() Android function, which returns the received
signal strength 𝑃𝑅𝑋 ,𝑖 in dBm, limited to the range of [−127, 126].
Note that in the practical implementation, the lowest recorded RSSI
values were -105 dBm. From the RSSI values, the pathloss (PL) is
calculated on the receiving device using calibration values from the
GAEN database3 as
PL = 𝑃TX,𝑗 − (𝑃RX,𝑖 + ΔRX,𝑖 ) ,

only 50% of exposures are detected by the Italian app. Thus, it is
crucial to study and improve the effectiveness of BLE for contact
tracing in real environments.
Major contact tracing data-sets and data repositories are provided by the MIT PACT project [1] and the DP-3T initiative [2].
Closest to the research presented in this paper is the study of BLE
RSSI based distance estimation presented in [7], where several isolated effects such as body shielding or complex real-world situations
are investigated. In our study, we will add a new dataset of moderate complexity (joint effect of body shielding and multi-path) and
extend the investigation by providing UWB-based measurements
in addition to BLE RSSI logs.

TESTBED IMPLEMENTATION

The measurement testbed comprises off-the-shelf smartphones running a mobile measurement app that has been developed for the
purpose of evaluating contact tracing technologies. The app captures BLE RSSI values provided by the onboard BLE module and
UWB distance measurements retrieved from an external module.
Figure 1 visualizes the testbed and its use.

3.1

Testbed Hardware and Software

The testbed smartphones are of type Samsung Galaxy S7 or Samsung XCover 4s (Android version 8 and 9, Android BLE API). We
do not make use of the Google/Apple API as the aim of the study is
to investigate lower-level information provided by the BLE module.
Via USB port, the smartphones connect to the UWB sensors [3].
The core component of the sensor is the Decawave DW1000 UWB
transceiver chip, which is widely used for indoor localization.
The measurement app is a native Android app that provides
a user interface to control an experiment and to log BLE RSSI
and UWB distance values. The app logs last recent scan values at
configurable time intervals; 1 s is the default setting.
Upon start, the app sends BLE advertisements based on the
Generic Attribute Profile (GATT). When enabled by the user, a
BLE scan is started resulting in an asynchronous return of newly
scanned devices in BLE range. To restrict the devices reported in the
scan, filtering by universally unique identifier (UUID) is employed.

where ΔRX,𝑖 denotes the RX calibration value for scanning device
𝑖 and 𝑃TX,𝑗 the calibrated TX power level of advertising device 𝑗.
For the used Samsung XCover these are 𝑃 TX = 5 dBm and ΔRX =
−24 dB, and for the Samsung S7 𝑃 TX = 10 dBm and ΔRX = −33 dB.

3.3

UWB Distance Estimation

The UWB modules retrieve a distance estimate by time-of-flight
(ToF) calculation, obtained from timestamps that are recorded upon
packet transmission and reception. As the clocks of the receiver
and the transmitter are not synchronized, the ToF can only be
estimated. The most common estimation approach is double-sided
two-way ranging (DS-TWR) [10], which requires TX and RX time
stamps of three packet exchanges. We implement an extension to
DS-TWR, known as cooperative synchronization and ranging [4].
The ranging is configured such that distance estimates are updated
every 250 ms.

MEASUREMENT STUDY

Signal propagation is effected by body shielding and multi-path
propagation, which is well-known from literature [5]. We will quantify the effects for BLE-based and UWB-based distance estimation.

4.1

Experiment Setup

Two test persons are each equipped with a smartphone (Samsung
xCover, Samsung Galaxy S7) and connected UWB sensor that is
mounted on the left upper arm of the person. The experiments are
recorded by our measurement smartphone app. We study:
Carrying position: The two test persons are always carrying the
smartphone at the same position, i.e., (i) head – the smartphone is
held at the left ear, (ii) trunk – the smartphone is held in front of
the trunk, or (iii) pelvis – the smartphone is carried in the left front
trouser’s pocket.
Distance 𝑑: The distance between the two persons is varied from
1 m to 6 m in steps of 1 m.
Environment: An anechoic chamber, a corridor, and a corner are
selected, as depicted in Figure 2 (a)-(c).
Orientation: The relative orientation between the persons can be
0°,90°,180°, or 270° for head and pelvis carrying positions, and 0°or
180° for trunk; see Figure 2 (d).
Measuring all 180 combinations with a duration of 3 min yields
the BLE pathloss values visualized in Figure 3; the pathloss value
ranges from 22 dB to 70 dB. The correlation coefficient of a linear
approximation is 𝑟 = 0.506, which is a weak correlation between

4.2

Effect of Body Shielding

To isolate the effect of body shielding, we now discuss the BLE
attenuation in the anechoic chamber as visualized in Figure 4, left
column. The phone’s carrying position and orientation have a major
influence on the pathloss. In LOS scenarios (head, 180° and 270°;
trunk, 0°; pelvis, 0°) the mean pathloss is always lower than in
the other non-LOS scenarios, at the respective same distance. The
spread of pathloss is high in all carrying positions, i.e., up to 7.11 dB
(head, 𝑑 = 1 m), 11.69 dB (trunk, 𝑑 = 1 m), and 6.53 dB (pelvis,
𝑑 = 1 m). The spread due to body shielding is often higher than
the distance-dependent increase of attenuation. This is confirmed
by the weak linear correlation coefficients between pathloss and
distance, which are 𝑟 = 0.395 (head), 𝑟 = 0.5 (trunk), and 𝑟 = 0.356
(pelvis). As a consequence, estimating the distance accurately in
the range required for contact tracing, i.e., 1-2 m, is not feasible
without knowledge about the carrying position and orientation.
The largest spread is found for head scenarios. For example,
at a distance of 1 m, the pathloss is 42 dB and 44 dB under LOS
conditions (180° and 270°) and when fully blocked by the head,
it is 57 dB (90°). It is worth noting that with increasing distance
this difference is decreasing due to a mean pathloss saturation at
approximately 64 dB (BLE packets with higher pathloss are lost).

4.3

Effect of Multi-path Propagation

Multi-path propagation is usually thought to hinder precise distance
measurements. However, comparing the pathloss in a multi-path
propagation environment (corridor, corner) to the pathloss in the
anechoic chamber, the effect of body shielding is less severe due
to reflections from the walls, as expressed by the smaller spread
of pathloss at a given distance (see Figure 4, columns 2 and 3 compared to column 1). The linear correlation coefficients between
distance and pathloss reflect this effect as well: 0.35 ≤ 𝑟 ≤ 0.56
4 Note that we use a simplified linear model for approximation at small distances which
we intend to enhance in the future.

-, -, -

(anechoic), 0.46 ≤ 𝑟 ≤ 0.6 (corridor), and 0.77 ≤ 𝑟 ≤ 0.83 (corner).
These results indicate that in environments with multi-path signal
propagation, distance estimation based on BLE pathloss may be
possible without knowing the carrying position and orientation,
which is not the case for non multi-path environments (e.g., outdoor
environments).
The highest correlation between distance and pathloss is observed in the corner scenario. At lower distances 𝑑 < 2 m, a low
pathloss below 42 dB is measured, which increases strongly with
larger distances. The corner itself is a major cause of this behavior as at smaller distances, LOS conditions are given and at larger
distances, the corner obstructs the LOS path of the signal.

4.4

Comparison BLE vs. UWB

As depicted in Figure 5, UWB measurements yield precise distance
estimates for all experiment settings that allow LOS propagation.
The signal of the LOS path is correctly recognized by the UWB
transceiver amongst other reflected paths. Notably, in the anechoic
chamber either the signal is strong enough to propagate through
particular body parts or no signal is received at all. The latter can
be observed, e.g., in the 90° (head and pelvis), where no measurements are available for distances above 2 m respectively 3 m. Wall
penetration of the UWB signal may lead to error-prone distance estimates, as seen in pelvis position at 90° orientation in the corridor,
or in the corner setting, where a room is located behind the corner
walls.
In comparison with BLE pathloss to distance correlation, UWB
measurements are very robust towards orientation and environment. While in the corridor and corner measurements multi-path
propagation causes errors, especially in the anechoic chamber,
which is comparable to an outdoor scenario with few reflections,
the performance of UWB is very good. The ToF-based distance
calculation by UWB is a major cause for these results.

CONCLUSIONS

To assess mobile contact tracing technology, we introduced a flexible measurement smartphone app capable to capture BLE RSSI
and UWB time-of-flight distance measurements. Our experimental
results reveal that BLE-based estimation of distance is sensitive
to carrying positions. Without knowing the carrying position and
orientation, distance estimation is not accurate. Remarkably, multipath propagation can reduce the effect of body shielding which
may be leveraged in indoor environments where reflections from
walls occur. Finally, UWB has demonstrated to be robust to different
environments and to some degree to body shielding.
