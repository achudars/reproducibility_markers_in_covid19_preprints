A BSTRACT
The Nonlinear Grey Bernoulli Model NGBM(1, 1) is a recently developed grey model which has
various applications in different fields, mainly due to its accuracy in handling small time-series
datasets with nonlinear variations. In this paper, to fully improve the accuracy of this model, a
novel model is proposed, namely Rolling Optimized Nonlinear Grey Bernoulli Model RONGBM(1,
1). This model combines the rolling mechanism with the simultaneous optimization of all model
parameters (exponential, background value and initial condition). The accuracy of this new model
has significantly been proven through forecasting Vietnam’s GDP from 2013 to 2018, before it is
applied to predict the total COVID-19 infected cases globally by day.

Introduction

At the beginning of 2020, there happened to be an out break of pneumonia, started from an unknown aetiology in
Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. A novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was found from a cluster of patients in
January 2020 [22]. Some scientists proposed a hypothesis that this strain of virus might have originated from bats that
could be traced back to Huanan South China Seafood Market, a seafood market [43]. There has been evidence about
person-to-person transmission since the middle of December 2019 [22].
The number of cases has increased exponentially since then and authorities all over the world have to promulgate laws
to alleviate the widespread of disease. Europe made the strict act as to close borders of all Schengen area [5]. At the
end of the first quarter, USA surpassed China to become the world’s most infected territory at more than 100, 000
confirmed cases [11]. Roughly a month later, USA, again, became the first country to surpass 1 million confirm cases,
however, the actually cases could be 10 times higher due to the lack of test kits [20, 33]. Most lately, after half a year of
outbreak, the total confirm cases all over the world has reached 10 million, with more than 500, 000 people died. No
country has succeeded in producing vaccination or special drugs, while the current situation is extremely complex and
unpredictable, the need of data modelling and prediction is a must.
The number of COVID-19 infected cases can be regarded as a time series problem. According to previous research,
time-varying process forecasting is one of the most important fields in terms of statistics. By collecting and analyzing
different data points, researchers could investigate the situation and surmount current problem. However, most of these
problems require a significant amount of data, which might be difficult due to the lack of information, or the ambiguity
and non-linearity of data. For example, data of exchange rate between two currencies may fluctuate throughout a day or
a period of time. Essentially, there is an urge to develop a method to solve this real-world dilemma.

RONGBM(1,1) AND APPLICATION IN PREDICTING TOTAL COVID-19 CASES - AUGUST 19, 2020

A lot of methodologies have been developed to solve the time series forecasting problems. Some can be implied,
including traditional statistical methods like AR (Autoregressive Model) [13, 9, 36], MA (Moving Average) [19],
ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) [2, 1] with abilities to predict linear trend, but are limited to fuzzy
data. Others algorithms that can break through the cyclic of information and predict it can be listed out as LSTM (Long
Short-term Memory) [15, 32], SVM (Support Vector Machine) [35], and Sliding Window [28]. Additionally, there are
some hybrid models that can outperform others with just limits information and can improve forecasting results.
To deal with the limitation of data, Grey method has been brought into consideration. Grey method was proposed by
Deng Ju-Long in March, 1982 [25]. In Grey system theory [24, 25], considered the degree of information, a white
system is a system in which all information is known, while a black system is a system contains all unknown parts.
Additionally, a system which consists of both known and unknown information is called a Grey system [25]. According
to Guo, R. [18], the Grey system outperforms other methods with just a limited number of discrete data, to achieve
an insignificant margin of error of prediction versus real value. The system of total COVID-19 infected cases can be
treated as a Grey system due to its constraint of data.
Mathematically, the traditional Grey predicting model is based on the least square reduction and the first-order linear
ordinary differential equation. For instance, traditional GM(1, 1) can be taken into account [21, 44, 37] to solve this
problem. Notably, to reinforce the predicting accuracy, some researchers have studied and combined to create hybrid
Grey models, such as grey-Markov [21, 27], grey-Fourier [42], grey-Taguchi [14]. Some more hybrid models such
as Grey rolling mechanism [3, 7, 23] or nonlinear Grey Bernoulli method [38, 10, 41, 26] can also be taken into
consideration. In this paper, rolling mechanism is combined with nonlinear Grey Bernoulli method to propose a rolling
optimized nonlinear Grey Bernoulli model, or RONGBM(1, 1). For benchmarking, AR, Artificial Neural Network
(ANN), and LSTM are used to compare the accuracy with RONGBM(1, 1). This hybrid model is used to optimize
the accuracy of predicting the total COVID-19 infected cases with just 11 entries of data (from January 28th, 2020 to
February 7rd, 2020). The beginning date was chosen due to the fact that, there might have been uncleared data on those
previous days.
The remainder of this paper will be organized as follows. In Section 2, we will provide a brief description of the
traditional Grey models, including GM(1, 1) and the Nonlinear Grey Bernoulli Model GM(1, 1). Section 3 briefly
introduces methods of optimizing parameters simultaneously in the formation of the optimized ONGBM(1, 1) model.
In section 4, the application of the rolling mechanism is presented to propose a new RONGBM(1, 1) model. Section 5
provides some statistical and modern machine learning models as a benchmarking tool for the proposed model in the
previous section. Section 6 introduces some modern machine learning models as an additional benchmarking tool for
the newly proposed model in the empirical examples. Section 7 adopts the example of predicting Vietnam’s GDP to
demonstrate the accuracy of the new RONGBM(1, 1) model in comparison with models in Section 5, then applies this
new model into predicting the total COVID-19 infected cases until 2020-02-18. Section 8 concludes the paper by
drawing some conclusions and future work.

Description of the traditional GM(1, 1) and NGBM(1, 1) models

In this section, a brief introduction of the mathematical modelling of two traditional models: GM(1, 1) and Nonlinear
Grey Bernoulli Model NGBM(1, 1) is introduced.
2.1

Building the traditional Grey model GM(1, 1)

Assume that x(0) is the non - negative original historical time series of data with m entries as:
x(0) = {x(0) (1), x(0) (2), ..., x(0) (k), ..., x(0) (m)}
Next, we define x(1) using one-time accumulated generating operation (1 - AGO), which is as
x(1) = {x(1) (1), x(1) (2), ..., x(1) (k), ..., x(1) (m)}
where

x(0) (k), k = 2, 3, ..., m
x (k) =

(3)

(1)

As x is a monotonic increasing sequence which is similar to the solution of a first-order linear differential equation,
one can assume that the solution of the following differential equation
dx̂(1)
+ ax̂(1) = b
(4)
dt

RONGBM(1,1) AND APPLICATION IN PREDICTING TOTAL COVID-19 CASES - AUGUST 19, 2020

represents the Grey predicted value complement to the initial condition x̂(1) (1) = x(0) (1) and parameters a and b.
By definition,

dx̂
dt

can be written as:
dx̂(1)
x̂(1) (t + ∆t) − x̂(1) (t)
= lim
∆t→0
dt
∆t

(5)

However, to discretize the differential equation, ∆t can be set to be equal to 1, which means that (5) can be rewritten as
dx̂(1)
= x̂(1) (t + 1) − x̂(1) (t) = x(1) (t + 1) − x(1) (t) = x(0) (t + 1)
dt

(6)

The Grey predicted value is now defined as
x̂(1) (t) ≈ P x(1) (k) + (1 − P )x(1) (k + 1) = z (1) (k + 1), k = 1, 2, 3, ..., m
with P usually set as

1

(7)

in the traditional models.

The differential equation can now be discretized as:
x(0) (k) + az (1) (k) = b
By the least-squared method, the coefficients a and b can be determined by

The Nonlinear Grey Bernoulli Model NGBM(1, 1)

In order to obtain higher accuracy in predicting comparing to the original GM(1, 1) model, Professor Chen [4] proposed
the Nonlinear Bernoulli Grey Model NBGM(1, 1) as follows:
Similarly to the traditional Grey model GM(1, 1), assume that x(0) is the non - negative original historical time series of
data with m entries as:
x(0) = {x(0) (1), x(0) (2), ..., x(0) (k), ..., x(0) (m)}
(14)
Next, we define x(1) using one-time accumulated generating operation (1 - AGO), which is as
x(1) = {x(1) (1), x(1) (2), ..., x(1) (k), ..., x(1) (m)}
where

As indicated previously, equation (4) is a linear differential equation. A similar form of this equation, which is nonlinear
and has the form of:
in
h
dx̂(1)
(17)
+ ax̂(1) = b x̂(1)
dt
where n ∈ R any real number is called a Bernoulli equation, or the with then differential equation of the NGBM(1, 1)
model.
The background value is now also defined as:
z (1) (k + 1) = (1 − P )x(1) (k) + P x(1) (k + 1)
with P =

1
2

for the traditional model. Then, discretizing the ODE, one obtains
h
in
x(0) (k) + az (1) (k) = b x(1) (k)

(18)

(19)

which is called the basic Grey differential equation of the NGBM(1, 1) model. It can easily be recognized that for
n = 0, this equation turns to equation (4), which is the traditional GM(1, 1) model; for n = 2, the equation turns to the
Grey-Verhulst equation.
By the least square method, the parameters a and b can be determined by:

The Optimized Nonlinear Grey Bernoulli Model ONGBM(1, 1)
Optimization of the exponential parameter

Based on the basic principle of the information overlapping of the Grey system, Wang et al. (2009) [37] proposed a
formula determining the value of the exponential parameter by:
m−1
1 X
n=
γ(k)

(25)

However, with the existence of modern programming languages, this formula yields the problem of inflexibility.
Moreover, as further investigated in Section 7, this formula yield a result which is significantly less effective, comparing
to the method of iterating on a pre-defined range of the exponential parameter of [−1, 1).

3.2

Optimization of the background value estimation

According to Wang et al. (2011) [38], the precision of any Grey model is highly dependent on the value of P in the
background value z (1) (k). Change et al. (2005) [7] produced an even stronger statement by stating that forecasting
accuracy of a Grey prediction model can be improved by optimizing parameter P .
The background value z (1) (k) of any (derived) Grey model is considered to be an approximation of the integral region
generated by the curve of the function x(1) and the abscissa axis within the interval [k − 1, k]. Mathematically, this
value is expressed as:
Z k
(1)
z (k) =
x(1) dx
(26)
k−1

Applying the mean value theorem, it can be derived that:
z (1) (k) = P x(1) (k) + (1 − P )x(1) (k − 1), P ∈ [0, 1]

(27)

1
2

which are exactly equations (8) and (18). Mentioned beforehand, P = is the usually chosen values for traditional
Grey models. However, it is trivial that the accuracy of the model depends heavily on the parameter P , which means
that fixing this parameter at 12 as usual will reduce massively the effectiveness when there are values fluctuating and
deviating from the overall trend.
Zhang (1993) [45] has proven that the parameter P determining the background values and parameter a satisfy the
following condition:
1

P = − a
(28)
a e −1
From this formula, we derive:

lim P = lim

(29)

which is a valid explanation for the setting of the value of P to 12 for traditional Grey prediction models. However,
when the value of a is significant (the absolute value of a is large enough), customarily setting the coefficient of P to 12
is incorrect, reducing the efficiency of the model.
As a result, a new calculating formula was proposed by Tan (2000) [34] as:
i
1 h
z (1) (k) =
(q + 1)x(1) (k − 1) + (q − 1)x(1) (k) , k = 2, 3, ..., m

This means that, we have defined the value of P by:

Once again, this formula yields the problem of inflexibility. As 1-AGO sequence is a strictly increasing sequence,

which has already omitted the range of 0, 12 for consideration. Moreover, as applied later, upon applying this formula,
the algorithm yields higher error than the empirically derived value of the same parameter. The optimal solution for this
problem would also be iterating on a well-defined range of values of P ([0, 1]) with a small enough step size.
P =

Within the previous session, the parameters P and n are not optimized simultaneously.
3.3

Optimization of the initial condition

Considering the particular solution of equation (17), the initial condition is set to be x(0) (1), the first point of the
original time series of data. Using the principle of new information prior choosing, the last item of the 1 - AGO series,
x(1) (m), can be used to enhance the accuracy of the model. Dang (2004) [12] has confirmed this theory by testing
on two different Grey models: GM(1, 1) and the Grey-Verhulst model. Replacing x(1) (m) for (0) (1) as the initial
condition, the time response function for the whitening equation of the NGBM(1, 1) model can be rewritten as:


 1
b
b 1−n
x̂(1) (k) =
x(1) (m)(1−n) −
(36)
e−a(1−n)(k−m) +
a
a
Furthermore, since the model parameters a and b are obtained with least square method, there will be high chances that
the model will not pass through the point x(0) (n), As a result, the new initial condition x(1) (m) will require correction
in order to maximize optimization. This means that the new initial term, instead, would be x(1) (m) + c.
The correction parameter c would be chosen in order to minimize the following function ( proposed by Lu et al. 2016
[26]):

Proposing algorithm

Based on the simultaneous optimization of three parameters: the exponential parameter, the initial condition and the
background value, we propose a further optimized algorithm of the Optimized NGBM(1, 1) given by Wu et al. (2019)
[41]. This algorithm is more practical and less time-consuming upon implementing in the currently available computer
languages (R, Python or Matlab):
1. Given the original time series of the data x(0) = {x(0) (1), x(0) (2), ..., x(0) (m)}, calculate the 1 - AGO
sequence x(1) .
2. Indicate the range of values for P and n. According to the mean value theorem, P must belong to the range
[0, 1], while n is usually considered within the range of [−1, 1). Considering currently available computational
tools, the step size is usually set at 0.001 − 0.01.
Remark: Empirically, for n ∈
/ [−1, 1), the model has been proven to yield higher error on average, reducing
the efficiency of the model. As a result, the values of n outside the interval is not within our interest.
3. For the pair of values of P and n, calculate the matrices B and Y , which yields parameters a and b.
4. Calculate RPE and ARPE for each a and b. Then, choose the parameters which yield the minimum ARPE.
5. Calculate the values of E(k) and A(k) to deduce the error correction first initial condition x(1) (m) + c. Then,
compute x̂(1) based on the proposed discrete time response function (44).
6. From x̂(1) , using the inverse AGO, compute x̂(0) .

The Rolling Optimized Nonlinear Grey Bernoulli Model RONGBM(1, 1)

As mentioned by Akay and Atak (2007) [3], the rolling mechanism is an efficient technique to increase forecasting
accuracy of Grey prediction when there are exponential increasing/decreasing or chaotic data. This mechanism provides
the ability to update input data by removing the oldest data points for each loop before applying the prediction algorithm.
Its purpose is that, for each rolling step, the set of data points used for the upcoming forecasting is the most recent.
Wu et al. (2019) [41] is the first paper to ever mention the application of rolling mechanism to the NGBM(1, 1) to
enhance accuracy. However, the proposed model did not reach the maximum efficiency due to the following reasons:
1. In the proposed algorithm, the optimization of the parameters P and n are determined by running a loop
through a set of pre-defined value by the user. In this case, the author defined the set of values of P to be
between 0 and 1, with the step of 0.01; while n is considered between −1 and 0.99, with the step of 0.01. This
step size for both parameters is still large enough to miss the optimal value.
2. In Algorithm 1, the background value is set as
z (1) (k) = P (x(1) (k) + x(1) (k + 1)), k = 1, 2, ..., m

(44)

which is not the optimal approximation and not compatible with the mean value theorem.
3. As proposed, re-initiating the initial value to x(1) (m) will enhance accuracy of the algorithm. However, this
can further be improved by correcting this initial value itself with the error correction parameter c proposed in
the previous section.
4. The rolling mechanism implemented in Algorithm 1 of [41] is incorrect. The rolling mechanism requires the
insertion of the predicted value into the new array, while removing the oldest data point. In the algorithm,
however, the author inserted the actual value instead of the predicted value, which develops biases for this
model.

x(0) = {x(0) (1), x(0) (2), ..., x(0) (k), ..., x(0) (m)}

and the output sequence of predicted data would be:
x̂(0) = {x̂(0) (1), x̂(0) (2), ..., x̂(0) (k), ..., x̂(0) (m), x̂(0) (m + 1), ..., x̂(0) (M )}, M ≥ m + 1, M ∈ N

2. Set the training data to x(0) = {x(0) (1), x(0) (2), ..., x(0) (m)}. Use this training data to predict the following
data points:
{x(0) (1), x(0) (2), ..., x(0) (m), x(0) (m + 1)}
(47)
3. While i ≤ M − m:
(a) Set the new value of i as i := i + 1
(b) Set the training data to x(0) = {x(0) (i), x(0) (i + 1), ..., x(0) (m + i − 1)}.
(c) Apply the Optimized NGBM(1, 1) model on this new training data to predict x̂(0) (m + i).
Remark: For each i, there will be different values of the set of the model parameters {a, b, P, n}.
(d) Return to the beginning of this step.
4. When i = M − m, we have had all the predicted values {x̂(0) (m + 1), x̂(0) (m + 1), ..., x̂(0) (M )}.
5. Our output sequence of predicted data would now be:
x̂(0) = {x(0) (1), x(0) (2), ..., x(0) (k), ..., x(0) (m), x̂(0) (m + 1), ..., x̂(0) (M )}

Performance evaluation

In order to examine the precision of each model, it is necessary to evaluate the difference between the fitted values and
the actual values. For each specific time stamp k, the relative percentage error (RPE) calculates the relative difference
of the forecast and recorded value by:
RP E = (k) =

x(0) (k) − x̂(0) (k)
× 100%, k = 1, 2, 3, ..., m
x(0) (k)

(49)

where x(0) (k) is the actual value and x̂((0)(k) is the fitted value.
The overall precision of the model can be measured by the average relative percentage error (ARPE), which is determined
by:
m
m
X

x(0) (k) − x̂(0) (k)
ARP E = (avg) =

The classification of the model precision based on ARPE is described in Table 1 below [41].

newly-proposed Grey model.

Comparison with alternative algorithms

In this section, we will indicate some alternative machine learning algorithms based on neural network. For this
paper, we used 2 Neural Network models: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM).
Historically, recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were first introduced to
handle such heavy-load tasks, like Image Processing or Natural Language Processing, and thus they were too complex
for typical time series problems. However, researchers have started to adopt these deep learning methods, and turned
them into perfect fits for a time-varying process. There are 2 main properties that make NN a competitive candidate for
time series. NNs have general nonlinear function mapping capability that can approximate any continuous function.
This gives NNs a capability of handling any complex problems with limited data. Moreover, NN is a non-parametric
data-driven model, hence it does not require (mostly) any constraints. This is the key point for solving nonlinear,
non-pattern problems that may have unique characteristics that cannot be captured by parametric model [36].
6.1

Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a brain-inspired system, which simulates the way human learns. A single layer
neural network is called a Perceptron, which can give a single output.

Figure 1: A Perception [8]
9

RONGBM(1,1) AND APPLICATION IN PREDICTING TOTAL COVID-19 CASES - AUGUST 19, 2020

To use ANN, we have to decide an Activation function, which converts an input signal of a node in an ANN to an output
signal. This output signal is used as input to the next layer in the stack [8]. There are 4 Activation functions that can be
taken into consideration.
• Threshold Activation function (Binary Step function) A threshold-based binary activation function. For
classification only (because of activated cases only 1 or 0).

0, x < 0
f (x) =
(53)
1, x > 0
• Sigmoid Activation function (Logistic function) A S-shaped curve or sigmoid, ranges between 0 and 1. For
predicting the probability
1
(54)
φ(z) =
1 + e−z
• Hyperbolic Tangent function (tanh) A similarity to sigmoid, but better in performance, ranges between -1 and
1. Perfect fit for layer stacking.
f (x) = tanh(x)
(55)
• Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) The most common Activation function in both CNN and ANN, ranges from
zero to infinity [0, ∞).
Based on the difference between the actual value and the predicted value, an error value called Cost Function is
computed and sent back through the system. Between an input layer and an output layer is at least a hidden layer. The
hidden layers perform computations on the weighted inputs and produce net input which is then applied with activation
functions to produce the actual output. ANN uses a procedure called Back-propagation cyclically until the error value is
kept at minimum [8].

Figure 2: Back-Propagation procedure [8]
6.2

Long Short-term Memory (LSTM)

Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) is a RNN-based algorithm with the capability of learning long-term dependencies,
which was proposed by Sepp Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber in 1997. Vanilla RNN method suffers from short-term
memory during feed-forward. This means that, if processing data which has long time piece, it will be hard for RNN to
carry (or remember) data from earlier time steps to later ones. Thus, RNN may leave out important information from
the beginning. It also suffers from vanishing gradient problem in back-propagation. If a gradient value is too smal, it
does not contribute much in learning process.
LSTM was created as a solution to this problem. LSTM has feedback connection, which allows it to process the whole
data sequence. A general LSTM consists of multiple cells, with forget gates, an input and an output. They have the
ability to choose which information to carry on or leave behind. [32, 15, 30].

Empirical applications

7.1.1

Efficiency testing for the Rolling Optmizied Nonlinear Grey Bernoulli Model RONGBM(1, 1)
Context

After the end of the Vietnam War in Spring 1975, Vietnam’s economic status started to slow down and decline.
Furthermore, the embargo of the United States on Vietnam and the collapse of the Soviet Union led to the plummet of
the Vietnam economy, hit rock-bottom in 1989 - 1990 [16]. Since then, the economic status has revived significantly,
with the annual growth rate of 6-8% [17].
As mentioned above, we used GDP data between 2005 and 2018, as from 2005 and after, Vietnam’s GDP has some
certain growth in economic status and annual growth rate. Moreover, Vietnam is on the verge of development and
integration into the world, using this range of data will enhance the forecasting accuracy, as it can avoid the inaccurate
that those previous world events bring.
In this section, we will regard the most important macroeconomics variable as our testing data: the annual Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) of Vietnam, between 2005 and 2018. These data can be retrieved from World Bank Open
Data (https://data.worldbank.org/)
7.1.2

Methodology

In order to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the newly proposed Rolling Optimized NGBM(1, 1)
(abberivated as RONGBM(1, 1)), we will proceed to compare this model with the existing Grey models, including:
• The traditional Grey model GM(1, 1)
• The traditional Nonlinear Grey Bernoulli Grey Model NGBM(1, 1)
• The Optimized Nonlinear Grey Bernoulli Model ONGBM(1, 1). This model has adapted all possible
optimization mentioned previously, including optimization of the background value, initial condition and
exponential parameter.
The data from 2004 to 2013 will be used for training, and data from 2014 to 2018 will be used for forecasting and
testing models.

Results and analysis

From Table 3 and Table 4, it can easily be observed that the ARPE generated by the newly proposed Rolling Optimized
NGBM(1, 1) model is significantly smaller than that of comparing models. This is due to the fact that the initial
condition x(1) (m) + c and the original training data have been updated, which yields closer result to the actual data.
This empirical result also explains the conclusion driven in the previous sections that the estimating formula for the
exponential parameter n and the background value P is not optimal, namely (25) and (31). Upon using the equations
above, the values of P and n would be:

P = 0.5484042
(56)
n = −0.1387509
which yield higher ARPE (2.8314%) for the first 10 GDP values between 2004 − 2013 comparing to the parameters
derive empirically below with ARPE of 1.3855%.
Moreover, as mentioned above, the empirical value of P = 0.495 cannot be captured by equation (31).

Applying and benchmarking RONGBM(1, 1) in predicting 2019 - nCoV total infected cases
Context

Right before the beginning of 2020, a new strain of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was found from of patients in the
area of Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from patients at early state
showed that this new type of disease shared 79.5% sequence identify to SARS-CoV in 2003. This COVID-19 genome
could also be traced back to bats coronavirus [31, 43, 22]. Researchers ared scared that this could be a new epidemic
similar to the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemic in 2003 and 2012 separately that terrified worldwide.
7.2.2

Methodology

The total infected cases were retrieved free of charge from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/
coronavirus/coronavirus-cases/). We decided to use 2020-01-28 as the starting data point, as it would be
more precise in terms of medical data collecting and analysis.

Apart from comparing the Grey models, alternative modern machine learning models are also taken into account to
compare accuracy and efficiency with Grey models.
In this section, the Rolling Optimized NGBM(1, 1) will not be taken into account considering the ARPE. As the training
data sample is relatively small, this model will only be used to predict from the available data, based on the significant
efficiency it has proven comparing to the Optimized NGBM in the previous example.
Considering the press release given be Reuters [39] stating that the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak will happen at midor late-February, we will proceed to predict the total infected cases everyday globally, starting from 2020-02-09 to
2020-02-18.

Results and analysis

Considering 5 different models predicting within the time range 2020-01-28 to 2020-02-08, the Optimized NGBM(1,
1) and even the traditional NGBM(1, 1) perform significantly better than two modern machine learning model (ANN
and LSTM). This is due to the fact illustrated previously that NGBM(1, 1) yields relatively high accuracy upon handling
short one - dimensional time series data.
Within the next 10 days, from 2000-02-09, similar to the example of predicting Vietnam’s GDP 2013 − 2018, the
predictions of the rolling optimized NGBM(1, 1) are lower than that of ONGBM(1, 1). This is due to the update of
new data, reducing the increasing rate. However, both of the two predictions confirm that the peak of this COVID-19
outbreak will still not be happening within the next 10 days. From plot 9, it can be easily derived that the new infected
cases by day is increasing, and there has been no signs of stopping.

Conclusion and future suggestions

In this paper, a new rolling optimized NGBM(1, 1) model has been proposed. There are two following major advantages
of this model in comparison with the existing ones:
• Within the proposed model, all of the parameters are optimized simultaneously, including the exponential
parameter, the background value and the initial condition.
• The first application of the rolling mechanism upon the combination of all currently available methods of
parameter optimization.
The efficiency of this newly proposed model has also been tested with the other Grey models (GM(1, 1), NGBM(1,
1) and ONGBM(1, 1)), which showed significant improvement. Later, while this model is applied to predict the total
COVID-19 infected cases, it has also been put into comparison with the latest and most effective machine learning
models, including Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Within the context of
extremely limit amount of data and time constrain, RONGBM(1, 1) outperforms both of the two other models, which
additionally confirms the effectiveness of Grey models upon dealing with small amount of data.

RONGBM(1,1) AND APPLICATION IN PREDICTING TOTAL COVID-19 CASES - AUGUST 19, 2020

From the results obtained by applying RONGBM(1, 1) on available data until the final day of retrieval (2020-02-10),
there are now signs that the outbreak of COVID-19 will reach its peak within the next 10 days as expected. The
number of newly infected patients reported everyday will even be higher than that of the present, increasing day by day.
However, as Grey models are only applied on one-dimensional time series data, it is impossible to detect or predict
changes due to any other related or outside effects (medical advancement, natural conditions, etc.). As a result, with
enough amount of background knowledge into the field, applying a multivariate Grey model would yield more accurate
and medically meaningful results.
Considering the proposed model RONGBM(1, 1) itself, there are two major problems that should be discussed and
investigated in the future:
• Training data size: As the training data size has a significant impact on any Grey model [40], the amount
of data used in the COVID-19 infected case estimation has been manually chosen. In the future, for Grey
models to reach maximum optimality, there should be a formal, mathematically derived procedure to define
the optimal size of training data.
• Parameter optimization: Within the proposed model, in order to obtain the optimization of the two parameters
P and n, two loops have been run through. Due to the resource constrain of the current computational tools,
the step size of these loops are still large enough to omit actual optimal values, leading to the model not
perfectly optimized. Moreover, using the proposed formula, as demonstrated within the practical section, does
not yield the optimal error. As a result, in the future, there should be a mathematically exact way to derive the
parameter values optimally.
