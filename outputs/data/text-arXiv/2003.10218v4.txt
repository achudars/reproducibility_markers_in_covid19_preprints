Abstract
There is a continuing debate on relative benefits of various mitigation and suppression strategies
aimed to control the spread of COVID-19. Here we report the results of agent-based modelling using a
fine-grained computational simulation of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. This model is
calibrated to match key characteristics of COVID-19 transmission. An important calibration outcome
is the age-dependent fraction of symptomatic cases, with this fraction for children found to be one-fifth
of such fraction for adults. We apply the model to compare several intervention strategies, including
restrictions on international air travel, case isolation, home quarantine, social distancing with varying
levels of compliance, and school closures. School closures are not found to bring decisive benefits, unless
coupled with high level of social distancing compliance. We report several trade-offs, and an important
transition across the levels of social distancing compliance, in the range between 70% and 80% levels,
with compliance at the 90% level found to control the disease within 13–14 weeks, when coupled with
effective case isolation and international travel restrictions.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an ongoing crisis caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first outbreak was detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, the
capital of Hubei province, rapidly followed by the rest of Hubei and all other provinces in China. Within
mainland China the epidemic was largely controlled by mid- to late March 2020, having generated more than
81,000 cases (cumulative incidence on 20 March 2020 [1]). This was primarily due to intense quarantine
and social distancing measures, including: isolation of detected cases; tracing and management of their close
contacts; closures of potential zoonotic sources of SARS-CoV-2; strict traffic restrictions and quarantine
on the level of entire provinces (including suspension of public transportation, closures of airports, railway
stations, and highways within cities); cancellation of mass gathering activities; and other measures aimed to
reduce transmission of the infection [2, 3, 4].
Despite the unprecedented domestic control measures, COVID-19 was not completely contained and the
disease reached other countries. On 31 January 2020, the epidemic was recognised by the World Health
Organization (WHO) as a public health emergency of international concern, and on 11 March 2020 the WHO
declared the outbreak a pandemic [5]. Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have quickly spilled over from the
healthcare sector into international trade, tourism, travel, energy and finance sectors, causing profound social
and economic ramifications [6]. While worldwide public health emergencies have been declared and mitigated
in the past—e.g., the “swine flu” pandemic in 2009 [7, 8, 9, 10]—the scale of socio-economic disruptions caused
by the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic is unparalleled in recent history.
Australia began to experience most of these consequences, with the number of confirmed COVID-19
cases crossing 1,000 by 21 March 2020, whilst (at that time) doubling every three days, and the cumulative
incidence growth rate averaging 0.20 per day during the first three weeks of March 2020 (Appendix A in
SI). In response, the Australian government introduced strict intervention measures in order to prevent
the epidemic from continuing along such trends and to curb the devastating growth seen in other COVID19 affected nations. Nevertheless, there is an ongoing debate on the utility of specific interventions (e.g.,
school closures), the low compliance with social distancing measures (e.g., reduction of mass gatherings),
and the optimal combination of particular health intervention options balanced against social and economic
ramifications, and restrictions on civil liberties. In the context of this debate, there is an urgent requirement
for rigorous and unbiased evaluations of available options. The present study makes a contribution towards
this requirement and provides timely input into the Australian pandemic response discussion. Specifically,
we develop a large-scale Agent-Based Model (ABM) capturing salient features of COVID-19 transmission in
Australia, and use it to evaluate the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions with respect to the
population’s compliance with the suggested measures.
Governments around the world are presently fighting the spread of COVID-19 within their jurisdictions
by developing, applying and adjusting multiple variations on pandemic intervention strategies. While these
strategies vary across nations, they share fundamental approaches which are adapted by national healthcare
systems, aiming at a broad adoption within societies. In the absence of a COVID-19 vaccine, as pointed
out by Ferguson et al. [11], mitigation policies may include case isolation of patients and home quarantine
of their household members, social distancing of the individuals within specific age groups (e.g., the elderly,
defined as older than 75 years), as well as people with compromised immune systems or other vulnerable
groups. In addition, suppression policies may require an extension of case isolation and home quarantine
with social distancing of the entire population. Often, such social distancing is supplemented by school and
university closures.
Our primary objective is an evaluation of several intervention strategies that have been deployed in
Australia, or have been considered for a deployment: restriction on international arrivals (“travel ban”);
in-home case isolation (CI) of ill individuals; home quarantine (HQ) of family members of ill individuals;
social distancing (SD) at various population compliance levels up to and including 100%, a full lockdown;
school closures (SC), which affect the behavior of school children as well as their parents and teachers. We
explore these intervention strategies independently and in various combinations, as detailed in Methods. Each
scenario is traced over time and compared to the baseline model in order to quantify its potential to curtail
the epidemic in Australia. Our aims are to identify minimal effective levels of social distancing compliance,

2

and to determine the potential impact of school closures on the effectiveness of intervention measures.
Stochastic agent-based models have been established as robust tools for tracing the fine-grained effect of
heterogeneous intervention policies in diverse epidemic and pandemic settings [12, 13, 8, 14, 7, 15, 16, 17, 18],
including for policy advice currently in place in the USA and the UK [11]. In this study, we follow the ABM
approach to quantitatively evaluate and compare several mitigation and suppression measures, using a highresolution individual-based computational model calibrated to key characteristics of COVID-19 pandemics.
The approach uses a modified and extended agent-based model, AceMod, previously developed and validated
for simulations of pandemic influenza in Australia [19, 20, 21, 22]. The epidemiological component, AMTraC19, is developed and calibrated specifically to COVID-19 via reported invariants (outputs) such as the growth
rate above. Importantly, our sensitivity analysis shows that key epidemiological outputs from our model (e.g.,
the growth rate, R0 , generation time, etc.) are robust to uncertainty in the input parameters (e.g., the natural
history of the disease, fraction of symptomatic cases, etc.).
In investigating possible effects of various intervention policies, we are able to provide clear and tangible
goals for the population and government to pursue in order to mitigate the pandemic within Australia. The
key result, based on a comparison of several intervention strategies, is an actionable transition across the
levels of social distancing compliance, identified in the range between 70% and 80% levels. A compliance
of below 70% is unlikely to succeed for any duration of social distancing, while a compliance at the 90%
level is found to control the disease within 13–14 weeks, when coupled with effective case isolation, home
quarantine, and international travel restrictions. We validate these results by a comparison with the actual
epidemic and social distancing compliance observed in Australia. In doing so, we confirm that the model has
successfully predicted the cumulative incidence as well as the timing of both the incidence and prevalence
peaks. Moreover, we illustrate trade-offs between these levels and duration of the interventions, and between
the interventions’ delay and their duration. Specifically, our simulations suggest that a three-day delay in
introducing strict intervention measures lengthens their required duration by over three weeks on average,
i.e., 23.56 days (with standard deviation of 11.167).

Results
We present results of the high-resolution (individual-based) pandemic modelling in Australia, including a comparative analysis of intervention strategies. As discussed above, we performed our analysis using AceMod,
an established Australian-census calibrated ABM that captures fine-grained demographics and social dynamics [19, 20, 21, 22]. The epidemiological component of our model, AMTraC-19, was developed and calibrated
to match key characteristics of COVID-19 (see Methods).
The input parameters were calibrated to generate key characteristics in line with reported epidemiological
data on COVID-19. We primarily calibrated by comparing these epidemiological characteristics to the mean
of output variables, inferred from Monte Carlo simulations during non-intervention periods, with confidence
intervals (CIs) constructed by bootstrapping (i.e., random sampling with replacement) with the bias-corrected
percentile method [23].
The key output variables, inferred in concordance with available data, include: a reproductive number R0
of 2.77, 95% CI [2.73, 2.83], N = 6, 315; a generation period Tgen of 7.62 days, 95% CI [7.53, 7.70], N = 6, 315;
a growth rate of cumulative incidence during a period of sustained and unmitigated local transmission at
Ċ = 0.167 per day, 95% CI [0.164, 0.170], N = 20; and an attack rate in children of Ac = 6.154%, 95% CI
[6.15%, 6.16%], N = 20. The relatively narrow confidence intervals reflect the intrinsic stochasticity of the
simulations carried out for the default values of input parameters. The broad range of possible variations
in response to changes in the input parameters, as well as the robustness of the model and its outcomes,
are established by the sensitivity analysis (see Appendix D in SI). This is followed by validation against
actual epidemic timeline in Australia (see Appendix H in SI), confirming that the adopted parametrization
is acceptable.

Baseline
A trace of the baseline model — no interventions whatsoever — is shown in Fig. 1, with clear epidemic peaks
in both incidence (Fig. 1.a) and prevalence (Fig. 1.b) evident after 105–110 days from the onset of the disease
in Australia, i.e., occurring around mid-May 2020. The scale of the impact is very high, with nearly 50%
of the Australian population showing symptoms. This baseline scenario is provided only for comparison, in
order to evaluate the impact of interventions, most of which were already in place in Australia during the
early phase of epidemic growth. To re-iterate, we consider timely intervention scenarios applicable to the
situation in Australia at the end of March 2020, with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases crossing
2,000 on 24 March 2020, and the growth rate of cumulative incidence Ċ averaging 0.20 per day during the
first three weeks of March. We observe that the simulated baseline generates Ċ ≈ 0.17 per day, in a good
agreement with actual dynamics.

Case isolation: CI, and home quarantine: HQ
All the following interventions include restrictions on international arrivals, triggered by the threshold of
2,000 cases. Three mitigation strategies are of immediate interest:
(i) case isolation,
(ii) in-home quarantine of household contacts of confirmed cases,
(iii) school closures, combined with (i) and (ii).
These strategies are shown in Fig. 1, with the duration of the SC strategy set as 49 days (7 weeks), starting
when the threshold of 2,000 cases is reached. The case isolation coupled with home quarantine delays the
epidemic peak by about 26 days on average (e.g., shifting the incidence peak from day 97.5 to day 123.2,
Fig. 1.a, and the prevalence peak from day 105 to day 130.7, Fig. 1.b, on average). In addition, CI combined
with HQ reduces the height of the epidemic peak by around 47–49%. The main contributing factor is case
isolation, as adding home quarantine, with 50% in-home compliance, to case isolation of 70% symptomatic
individuals, delays the epidemic peak by less than three days on average. The overall attack rate resulting
from the coupled policy is also reduced in comparison to the baseline scenario (Fig. 1.c). However, case
isolation and home quarantine, even when coupled together, are not effective for epidemic suppression, with
prevalence still peaking in millions of symptomatic cases (1.873M), Fig. 1.b. Such an outcome would have
completely overburdened the Australian healthcare system [24].

School closures: SC
Adding school closures to the case isolation and home quarantine approach also does not achieve a significant
reduction in the overall attack rate (Fig. 1). The peaks of both incidence (Fig. 1.a) and prevalence (Fig. 1.b)
are delayed by about four weeks (about 27 days for both incidence and prevalence). However, their magnitudes
remain practically the same, due to a slower growth rate of cumulative incidence (Fig. 1.d). This is observed
irrespective of the commitment of parents to stay home (Appendix G in SI). We also traced the dynamics
resulting from the SC strategy for two specific age groups: children and individuals over 65 years old, shown
in Appendix G in SI. The four-week delays in occurrence of the peaks are observed across both age groups,
suggesting that there is a strong concurrence in the disease spread across these age groups. We also observe
that under the SC strategy coupled with case isolation and home quarantine, the magnitude of the incidence
peak for children increases by about 7% shown in Appendix G in SI (Supplementary Fig. 9.a). This may
be explained by increased interactions of children in household and community social mixing environments,
when schools are closed. Under this strategy, there is no difference in the magnitude of the incidence peak
for the older age group (Appendix G in SI, Supplementary Fig. 10.a). We also note that the considered
interventions succeed in reducing a relatively high variance in the incidence fraction of symptomatic older
adults, thus, reducing the epidemic potential to adversely affect this age group specifically.
In short, the only tangible benefit of school closures, coupled with case isolation and home quarantine,
is in delaying the epidemic peak by four weeks, at the expense of a slight increase in the contribution of
children to the incidence peak. While school closures are considered an important part of pandemic influenza
4

response, our results suggest that this strategy is much less effective in the context of COVID-19. The
gains are further reduced by other societal costs of school closures, e.g., drawing their parents employed in
healthcare and other critical infrastructure away from work. There is, nevertheless, one more possible benefit
of school closures, discussed in the context of the population-wide social distancing in Appendix G in SI.

Social distancing: SD
Next, we examine the effects of population-wide social distancing in combination with case isolation and
restrictions on international arrivals. Here, we present the effects of different compliance levels on the epidemic
dynamics. Low compliance levels, set at less than 70%, did not show any potential to suppress the disease in
the considered time horizon (28 weeks), while the total lockdown, that is, complete social distancing at 100%,
managed to reduce the incidence and prevalence to zero, after 49 days of the mitigation. However, because
it is unrealistic to expect 100% compliance in the Australian context, we focus on the practically achievable
compliance levels: 70%, 80% and 90%, with their duration set to 91 days (13 weeks), shown in Fig. 2.
Importantly, during the time period that the SD level is maintained at 70%, the disease is not controlled,
with the numbers of new infected cases (incidence) remaining in hundreds, and the number of active cases
(prevalence) remaining in thousands. Thus, 70% compliance is inadequate for reducing the effective reproductive number below 1.0. In contrast, the two higher levels of SD, 80% and 90%, are more effective at
suppressing both prevalence and incidence during the 13-week social distancing period.
Figure 2 contrasts these three levels of SD compliance, “zooming in” into the key time period, immediately
following the introduction of social distancing. Crucially, there is a qualitative difference between the lower
levels of SD compliance (70%, or less), and the higher levels (80%, or more). For the SD compliance set at
80% and 90%, we observe a reduction in both incidence (Fig. 2.a) and prevalence (Fig. 2.b), lasting for the
duration of the strategy (91 days). With SD compliance of 80% the disease is not completely eliminated,
but incidence is reduced to less than 100 new cases per day, with prevalence below 1,000 by the end of the
suppression period, Fig. 2.b. It is important to note that while the disease is suppressed during the period
over which social distancing is in effect, resurgence of transmission is likely unless complete or near-complete
elimination has been achieved upon cessation of social distancing measures. Our results suggest that this
level of compliance would succeed in eliminating the disease in Australia if the strategy was implemented for
a longer period, e.g., another 4–6 weeks.
The 90% SD compliance practically controls the disease, bringing both incidence and prevalence to very
low numbers of isolated cases (and reducing the effective reproductive number to nearly zero). It is possible
for the epidemic to spring back to significant levels even under this level of compliance, as the remaining
sporadic cases indicate a potential for endemic conditions. We do not quantify these subsequent waves, as they
develop beyond the immediately relevant time horizon. Nevertheless, we do share the concerns expressed by
the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team: “The more successful a strategy is at temporary suppression,
the larger the later epidemic is predicted to be in the absence of vaccination, due to lesser build-up of herd
immunity” [11]. Given that the herd immunity threshold is determined by 1 − 1/R0 [25], the extent required
to build up collective immunity for COVID-19, assuming R0 = 2.77, may be estimated as 0.64, that is, 64%
of the population becoming infected or eventually immunised.
The cumulative incidence for the best achievable scenario (90% SD compliance coupled with case isolation,
home quarantine, and restrictions on international arrivals) settles in the range of 8,000 – 10,000 cases during
the suppression period, with resurgence still possible at some point after intervention measures are relaxed,
Fig. 2.c. The range of cumulative incidence at the end of the suppression is 8,313 – 10,090 over 20 runs, with
the mean of 9,122 cases and 95% CI [8,898, 9,354], constructed from the bias corrected bootstrap distribution
(see Source Data file). In terms of case numbers, this is an outcome several orders of magnitude better than
the worst case scenario, developing in the absence of the combined mitigation and suppression strategies.
We compare two sets of scenarios. In our primary scenarios, aligned with the actual epidemic curves in
Australia, the social distancing measures are triggered by 2,000 confirmed cases. In alternative scenarios,
the strict suppression measures are initiated earlier, being triggered by crossing the threshold of 1,000 cases
(Appendix H.1 in SI). The best agreement between the actual and simulation timelines is found to match a
delayed but high (90%) SD compliance, appearing to be followed from 24 March 2020, after a three-day period

5

with a weaker compliance which commenced on 21 March 2020 when the international travel restrictions were
introduced, as shown in Fig. 3 and detailed in Appendix H.2 in SI. For the 1,000 case threshold scenario,
we present the effects of different SD compliance levels (70% and 90%) on the spatial distribution of cases
on day 60. These are shown in Appendix I in SI, as choropleth maps of the four largest Australian Capital
Cities: Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth.
It is clear that there is a trade-off between the level of SD compliance and the duration of the SD strategy:
the higher the compliance, the more quickly incidence is suppressed. Both 80% and 90% compliance levels
control the spread within reasonable time periods: 18-19 and 13-14 weeks respectively. In contrast, lower levels
of compliance (at 70% or less) do not succeed for any duration of the imposed social distancing limits. This
quantitative difference is of major policy setting importance, indicating a sharp transition in the performance
of these strategies in the region between 70% and 80%.
Referring to Fig. 4, the identified transition across the levels of compliance with social distancing may also
be interpreted as a tipping point or a phase transition [28]. Various critical phenomena have been discovered
previously in the context of epidemic models, often interpreting epidemic diffusion in statistical-mechanical
terms, for example, as percolation within a network [29, 30, 31, 32]. The transition across the levels of SD
compliance is similar to percolation transition in a forest-fire model with immune trees [33]. Distinct epidemic
phases are evident in Fig. 4 at a certain percolation threshold between the SD compliance of 70% and 80%, at
which the critical regime exhibits the effective reproductive number Reff = 1.0. That is, crossing this regime
signifies moving into the phase where the epidemic is controlled, i.e., reducing Reff below 1.0.
We do not attempt to establish a more precise level of required compliance between 70% and 80%. Such
a precision would be of lesser practical relevance than the identification of 80% compliance as the minimal
acceptable level of social distancing, with 90% providing a shorter timeframe. The robustness of these results
is established by sensitivity analysis presented in Appendix D.2 in SI.
In addition, a three-day delay in introducing strong social distancing measures is projected to extend
the required suppression period by approximately three weeks, beyond the 91-day period considered in the
primary scenario (see Appendix H in SI). Finally, we report fractions of symptomatic cases across mixing
contexts (Appendix J in SI), with the infections through households being predominant. Notably, the household fractions steadily increase with the strengthening of SD compliance, while the corresponding fractions
of infections in the workplace and school environments decrease.

Summary
In short, the best intervention approach identified in our study is a combination of international travel
restrictions, case isolation, home quarantine, and social distancing with at least 80%–90% compliance for a
duration of approximately 91 days (13 weeks). These measures have been implemented in Australia to a
reasonable degree, however, it is unclear if testing throughput and contact tracing resources are sufficient to
facilitate effective interventions if incidence increases substantially. For these reasons, it is our conclusion that
social distancing is likely to continue to be the instrumental line of defense against COVID-19 in Australia.
In our study, compliance levels below 80% resulted in higher prevalence at the end of suppression period, and
increasing incidence during the social distancing period.
We point out that our results are relevant only for the duration of the mitigation and suppression, and a
resurgence of the disease is possible once these interventions cease, as shown in Fig. 2. We also note that a
rebound in the incidence and prevalence post-suppression period is not unavoidable: more efficient and largescale testing methods are expected to be developed in several months, and so the resultant contact tracing
and case isolation are likely to prevent a resurgence of the disease. The international travel restrictions are
assumed to stay in place. Hence, we do not quantify the precise impact of control measures beyond the
selected time horizon (28 weeks), aiming to provide immediately relevant insights. Furthermore, our results
should not be seen as policies optimised over all possible parameter combinations, but rather as a clear
demonstration of the extent of social distancing required to reduce incidence and prevalence over two to six
months.

Discussion
In this study we simulated several possible scenarios of COVID-19 pandemic’s spread in Australia. The
model, AMTraC-19, was calibrated to known pandemic dynamics, and accounted for age-dependent attack
rates, a range of reproductive numbers, age-stratified and social context dependent transmission rates, household clusters and other social mixing contexts, symptomatic-asymptomatic distinction, and other relevant
epidemiological parameters. An important calibration result was the need for age-dependent fractions of
symptomatic agents, with the fraction of symptomatic children found to be one-fifth of that of the adults.
We reported several findings relevant to COVID-19 mitigation and suppression policy setting. The first
implication is that the effectiveness of school closures is limited (under our assumptions on the age-dependent
symptomatic fractions and the infectivity in children), producing a four-week delay in epidemic peak, without
a significant impact on the magnitude of the peak, in terms of incidence or prevalence. The temporal benefit
of this delay may be offset not only by logistical complications, but also by some increases in the fractions
of both children and older adults during the period around the incidence peak. As the clinical picture of
COVID-19 in children continues to be refined [34], these findings may benefit from a re-evaluation when more
extensive pediatric data become available.
The second implication is related to the social distancing (SD) strategy, which showed little benefit for
lower levels of compliance (at 70% or less) — these levels do not produce epidemic suppression for any
duration of the social distancing restrictions. Only when the SD compliance levels exceed 80%, there is a
reduction in incidence and prevalence. Our modelling results indicate existence of an actionable transition
across these strategies in the range between 70% and 80%. In other words, increasing a compliance level just
by 10%, from 70% to 80%, may effectively control the spread of COVID-19 in Australia, by reducing the
effective reproductive number to near zero (during the suppression period).
We also reported a trade-off between the compliance levels and the duration of SD mitigation, with
90% compliance significantly reducing incidence and prevalence after a shorter period of 91 days (13 weeks).
Although a resurgence of the disease is possible once these interventions cease, we believe that this study could
facilitate a timely planning of effective intervention and exit strategies. In particular, this study contributed
to the report, “Roadmap to Recovery”, presented to the Australian Federal Government on 29 April 2020,
providing evidence for a comparison between two options. Rather than recommending “a single dominant
option for pandemic response in Australia”, the roadmap pointed out considerable and evolving uncertainties,
and presented two strategies: (i) a state by state elimination of local community transmissions (with the
restrictions remaining for a longer duration, but achieving lower cases and greater public confidence), and (ii)
controlled adaptation aimed at some minimal level of symptomatic cases within the health system capacity
(with phased and adaptive lifting of restrictions, beginning as early as May 15th 2020, but acknowledging
the high likelihood of prolonged global circulation of SARS-CoV-2) [35]. However, a precise evaluation of
detailed exit strategies, as well as the probability of elimination, lies outside of the scope of our study.
Future research will address several limitations of our study, including a more fine-grained implementation
of natural history of the disease, reducing uncertainty around the transmissibility and infectivity in young
people, incorporation of more recent Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data from 2020, and an account of
hospitalisations and in-hospital transmissions. We also hope to trace specific spatial pathways and patterns of
epidemics, in order to enable a detailed understanding of how the infection spreads in diverse circumstances
and localities, with the aim to identify the best ways to locate and curtail the pandemic spread in Australia. It
would be interesting to contrast our ABM with network-based approaches: while both frameworks depart from
the compartmental fully mixed models in capturing specific interactions affecting the infection spread, there
are differences in describing the context dependence and ways to intervene [30, 36]. In network-based models,
the most effective interventions have been found to be those which reduce the diversity of interactions [37], and
can be modelled by changes in the topology of contact networks [38]. And so one future direction would be a
comparison of the epidemic and intervention thresholds across the ABM and network-based models. Other
avenues lead to analysis of precursors and critical thresholds for possible emergence of new strains, as well as
various “change points” in the spreading rate [39, 31, 40], studies of genomic surveillance data interpreted as
complex networks [41, 42, 43], dynamic models of social behaviour in times of health crises [44, 45, 46], and
investigations of global socioeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic [47, 48, 6].

Figure 2: Effects of social distancing. Strong compliance with social distancing (at 80% and above)
effectively controls the disease during the suppression period, while lower levels of compliance (at 70% or
less) do not succeed for any duration of the suppression. A comparison of social distancing strategies, coupled
with case isolation, home quarantine and international travel restrictions, across different compliance levels

runs: for 70% SD the last day of suppression was 141.4 on average; for 80% SD it was 144.2; and for 90%
SD it was 141.5, see Source Data file). Case isolation, home quarantine and restrictions on international

Figure 4: Phase transition across the levels of social distancing compliance. Colour image plot
of disease prevalence as a function of time (horizontal axis) and social distancing (SD) compliance (vertical
axis). A phase transition is observed between 70% and 80% SD compliance (marked by a dotted line). For SD
compliance levels below 80%, the prevalence continues to grow after social distancing is implemented, while
for compliance levels at or above 80% the prevalence declines, following a peak formed after approximately
two months. The colours correspond to log-prevalence, traced from the epidemic’s onset until the end of
the suppression period. The isolines trace contours with constant values of log-prevalence. Vertical dashes
mark the time when threshold of 2,000 is crossed, triggering SD, averaged over 20 runs for each SD level.

Methods
AceMod, the Australian Census-based Epidemic Model, employs a discrete-time and stochastic agent-based
model to investigate complex outbreak scenarios across the nation over time. The AceMod simulator comprises over 24 million software agents, each with attributes of an anonymous individual (e.g., age, gender,
occupation, susceptibility and immunity to diseases), as well as contact rates within different social contexts
(households, household clusters, local neighbourhoods, schools, classrooms, workplaces). The set of generated
agents captures average characteristics of the real population, e.g., AceMod is calibrated to the Australian
Census data (2016) with respect to key demographic statistics. In addition, the AceMod simulator has integrated layered school attendance data from the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority
(ACARA), within a realistic and dynamic interaction model, comprising both mobility and human contacts.
These social mixing layers represent the demographics of Australia as close as possible to the Australian
Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and other datasets, as described in Appendix F in SI.
Potential interactions between spatially distributed agents are represented using data on mobility in
terms of commuting patterns (work, study and other activities), adjusted to increase precision and fidelity
of commute networks [49]. Each simulation scenario runs in 12-hour cycles (“day” and “night”) over the
196 days (28 weeks) of an epidemic, and agents interact across distinct social mixing groups depending
on the cycle, for example, in working groups and/or classrooms during a “day” cycle, and their households,
household clusters, and local communities during the “night” cycle. The interactions result in transmission of
the disease from infectious to susceptible individuals: given the contact and transmission rates, the simulation
computes and updates agents’ states over time, starting from initial infections, seeded in international airports
around Australia [19, 20]. The simulation is implemented in C++11, using the g++ compiler (GCC) 4.9.3
and GNU Autotools (autoconf 2.69, automake 1.15), running under CentOS release 6.9 (upstream Red Hat
4.4.7-18) on a High Performance Computing (HPC) service and utilising 4264 cores of computing capacity.
Post-processing of simulation results is carried out with MATLAB R2020a.
Simulating disease transmission in AceMod requires both (i) specifics of local transmission dynamics,
dependent on individual health characteristics of the agents, such as susceptibility and immunity to disease,
driven by their transmission and contact rates across different social contexts; and (ii) a natural disease history
model for COVID-19, i.e., the infectivity profile from the exposure, to the peak of infectivity, and then to
recovery, for a single symptomatic or asymptomatic infected individual. The infectivity of agents is set to
exponentially rise and peak at 5 days, after two days of zero infectivity. The symptoms are set to last up to
12 days post the infectivity peak, during which time infectiousness linearly decreases to zero. The probability
of transmission for asymptomatic/presymptomatic agents is set as 0.3 of that of symptomatic individuals;
and the age-dependent fractions of symptomatic cases are set as σc = 0.134 for children, and σa = 0.669
for adults. These parameters were calibrated to available estimates of key transmission characteristics of
COVID-19 spread, implemented in AMTraC-19, the Agent-based Model of Transmission and Control of the
COVID-19 pandemic in Australia.

Calibration
Despite several similarities with influenza, COVID-19 has a number of notable differences, specifically in
relation to transmissions across children, its reproductive number R0 , incubation and generation periods,
proportion of symptomatic to asymptomatic cases, the infectivity of the asymptomatic and presymptomatic
individuals, etc. (see Appendix B in SI). While uncertainty around the reproductive number R0 , the incubation and generation periods, as well as the age-dependent attack rates of the disease, have been somewhat
reduced [3, 4, 50], there is still an ongoing effort in estimating the extent to which people without symptoms,
or exhibiting only mild symptoms, might contribute to the spread of the coronavirus [51]. Furthermore, the
question whether the ratio of symptomatic to total cases is constant across age groups, especially children,
has not been explored in studies to date, remaining another critical unknown.
Thus, our first technical objective was to calibrate the AMTraC-19 model for specifics of COVID-19
pandemic, in order to determine key disease transmission parameters of AMTraC-19, so that the resultant
dynamics concur with known estimates. In particular, we investigated a range of the reproductive number R0

12

(the number of secondary cases arising from a typical primary case early in the epidemic). The range [2.0, 2.5]
has been initially reported by the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 [3]. Several studies
estimated that before travel restrictions were introduced in Wuhan on 23 January 2020, the median daily
reproduction number R0 in Wuhan was 2.35, with 95% confidence interval (CI) of [1.15, 4.77] [52]. On 15 April
2020, Australian health authorities reported R0 in the range [2.6, 2.7] [35], while more recent Australian and
international studies investigated R0 in the range [2.5, 3.5] [24, 35, 46, 40]. For example, a median R0 = 3.4
(CI [2.4, 4.7]) was used in a model of the COVID-19 spread in Germany [40], while the estimates reviewed
by Liu et al. [53] ranged from 1.4 to 6.49, with a mean of 3.28 and a median of 2.79. In our model, R0 , our
output variable y1 , was investigated in the range between 1.94 and 3.12, see Table 1, by varying a scaling
factor κ responsible for setting the contagiousness of the simulated epidemic, as explained in Appendix C in
SI [19, 21].
We aimed for the generation period Tgen , i.e., our output variable y2 , to stay in the range [6.0, 10.0] [54,
55, 11]. This is also in line with the reported mean serial interval of 7.5 days (with 95% CI of 5.3 to 19) [54].
In addition, we aimed to keep the resultant daily growth rate of cumulative incidence Ċ, output variable
y3 , around 0.2 per day, in order to be consistent with the disease dynamics reported in Australia and
internationally (see Appendix A in SI). Our focus was to characterise the rate of a rapid infection increase
during the sustained but unmitigated local transmission. This calibration target was chosen at the time,
mid-March 2020, to complement R0 and the generation period, given the lack of data on the epidemic peak
values, and fragmented patient recovery and prevalence data. By that time, despite different initial conditions
and disease surveillance regimes, as well as diversity of case definitions, several countries exhibited a similar
growth pattern. This suggested that a steady growth rate of approximately 0.2 per day may provide a
consistent calibration target during the early growth period, with seven out of the top eight affected nations
settling around this rate after a noisy transient (except South Korea where the initial growth had the cluster
nature, following a superspreading event [56]).
Another key constraint was a low attack rate in children, Ac , i.e., our output variable y4 , reported to be
in single digits. For example, only 2.4% of all reported cases in China were children, while a study in Japan
observed that “it is remarkable that there are very few child cases aged from 0–19 years”, with only 3.4% of
all cases in this age group [57].
The calibration was aimed at satisfying our key constraints, given by the expected ranges of output
variables. In doing so, we varied several “free” parameters, such as transmission and contact rates, the fraction
of symptomatic cases (making it age-dependent), the probability of transmission for both symptomatic and
asymptomatic agents, and the infectivity profile from the exposure. Specifically, we explored the time to
infectivity peak, our input parameter x1 , in proximity to known estimates of the mean incubation period, i.e.,
between 4 and 7 days, calibrating the time to peak to 5.0 days. In several studies, the mean incubation period
was reported as 5.2 days, 95% CI, 4.1 to 7.0 [54], while being distributed around a mean of approximately 5
days within the range of 2–14 days with 95% CI [58]. We also varied the symptoms’ duration after the peak
of infectivity, i.e., recovery period, our input parameter x2 , between 7 and 21 days, and calibrated it at 12.0
days, on a linearly decreasing profile from the peak.
The contact and transmission rates across various mixing contexts detailed in Appendices C and E in SI.
The probability of transmission for asymptomatic/presymptomatic agents, our input parameter x3 , was set
as 0.3 of that of symptomatic individuals (lower than in the AceMod influenza model), having been explored
between 0.05 and 0.45. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic infectivity profiles were changed to increase
exponentially after a latent period of two days, reaching the infectivity peak after five days, with the onset
of symptoms distributed across agents during this period, see Appendix C in SI.
The fraction of symptomatic cases, our input parameter x4 , was investigated in the range between 0.5 and
0.8, and set to two-thirds of the total cases (σa = 0.669), which concurs with several studies. For example,
the initial data on 565 Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan, China, who were symptom-screened and
tested, indicated that 41.6% were asymptomatic, with a lower bound estimated as 33.3% (95% CI: 8.3%,
58.3%) [59]. The proportion of asymptomatic cases on the Diamond Princess cruise ship was estimated in
the range between 17.9% (95% credible interval (CrI): 15.5–20.2%) to 39.9% (95% CrI: 35.7–44.1%) [60],
noting that most of the passengers were 60 years and older, and more likely to experience more symptoms.
The modelling study of Ferguson et al. [11] also set the fraction of symptomatic cases to σ = 0.669.

However, we found that our output variables were within the expected ranges only when this fraction is
age-dependent, with the fraction of symptomatic cases among children, our input parameter x5 , calibrated
to one-fifth of the one for adults, that is, σc = 0.134 for children, and σa = 0.669 for adults. This calibration
outcome per se, achieved after exploring the range σc ∈ [0.05, 0.25], is in agreement with the reported low
symptomaticity in children worldwide, and the observation that “children are at similar risk of infection as
the general population, though less likely to have severe symptoms” [61]. Another study of epidemiological
characteristics of 2,143 pediatric patients in China noted that over 90% of patients were asymptomatic, mild,
or moderate cases [62].
In summary, this combination of parameters resulted in the dynamics that matched several COVID-19
pandemic characteristics. It produced the following estimates and their confidence intervals, constructed
from the bias corrected bootstrap distribution:
1. the reproductive number R0 = 2.77, with 95% CI [2.73, 2.83] (sample size N = 6, 315);
2. the generation period Tgen = 7.62 days, with 95% CI [7.53, 7.70] (N = 6, 315);
3. the growth rate of cumulative incidence, determined at day 50, during a period of sustained unmitigated
local transmission, Ċ = 0.167 per day, with 95% CI [0.164, 0.170] and range [0.156, 0.182] (N = 20);
4. the attack rate in children Ac = 6.154%, with 95% CI [6.15%, 6.16%] and range [6.14%, 6.16%] (N = 20).
Both the reproductive number and the generation period correspond to κ = 2.75 (see Table 1 for other values
of κ). The resultant dynamics are shown in Figures 5 and 6. The sensitivity analysis of the output variables
to changes in the input parameters is presented in Appendix D.1 in SI. We point out that, in hindsight, one
may choose more comprehensive calibration targets and refine the model with different parametrizations. The
model presented in this study was calibrated by 24 March 2020, using Australian and international incidence
and prevalence data from two preceding months, as well as constraints on the output variables detailed above.
At the time, a limited testing capacity resulting in possible under-reporting of cases (especially pediatric)
may have introduced a potential bias in model calibration. Nevertheless, the study is described here as
an approach which succeeded in accurately predicting the epidemic peaks in Australia in early April (both
incidence and prevalence), while providing timely advice on relevant pandemic interventions.

Fraction of local community transmissions
We trace scenarios of COVID-19 pandemic spread in Australia, initiated by passenger arrivals via air traffic
from overseas. This process maintains a stream of new infections at each time step, set in proportion to the
average daily number of incoming passengers at that airport [20, 21]. These infections occur probabilistically,
generated by binomial distribution B(P, N ), where P and N are selected to generate one new infection within
a 50 km radius of the airport, per 0.04% of incoming arrivals on average.
In a separate study [43], we directly compared the fractions of local transmissions detected by our ABM
with the genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2, carried out in a subpopulation of infected patients within
New South Wales (NSW), the most populous state of Australia, until 28 March 2020. Only a quarter of
sequenced cases was deemed to be locally acquired (cases who had not travelled overseas in the 14 days

before illness onset), and this was in concordance with the trace obtained from our ABM model. Specifically,
having simulated the five-week period preceding intervention measures, we inferred all local transmission
links within households (HH), household clusters (HC), and local government areas which map to the census
statistical areas (SA). Each directed link connecting two infected individuals in the same mixing context is
detected if the infected agents share the same HH, HC or SA identifier, and the direction is inferred using
the relevant simulation time steps. Then the fraction of local community transmissions is determined as
the ratio between the number of the inferred transmission links and the number of total infections during
the corresponding time period. These fractions ranged between 18.6% (std. dev. 2.9%) for HH and HC
combined, and 34.9% (std. dev. 8.2%) for all transmissions within HH, HC and SA, broadly agreeing with
the fraction identified through genomic surveillance: 25.8% for all local transmissions [43].

Sensitivity analysis
We performed our sensitivity analysis using the local (point-based) sensitivity analysis (LSA) [63], as well
as global sensitivity analysis with the Morris method (the elementary effect method) [64]. Each method
computes the response of an “output” variable of interest, e.g., the generation period, to the change in an
“input” parameter, e.g., the fraction of symptomatic cases. The response Fi,j of the state variable yj to
parameter xi from a scaled vector of all k input parameters, X = [0, 1]k , is determined as a finite difference
Fi,j =

yj (x1 , x2 , . . . , xi + ∆, xi+1 , . . . , xk ) − yj (X)
∆

(1)

where ∆ is a discretisation step, dividing each dimension of the parameter space. The distribution of each
response Fi,j is obtained by repeated random sampling with a number of simulation runs per step. In LSA,
an input parameter is varied, while keeping other inputs set at their base points, i.e., default values. In the
Morris method, an input parameter is varied at a number of different points sampled across the domains
of other parameters. The mean µ∗i,j of the absolute response |Fi,j | serves to capture the influence of the
parameter xi on the output yj : a large mean suggests a higher sensitivity. The standard deviation σi,j of
the response Fi,j is a complementary measure of sensitivity: a large deviation indicates that the dependency
between the input and output is nonlinear. In the Morris method, a large deviation may also indicate
that the input parameter interacts with other parameters [65]. Importantly, the responses are not directly
comparable across the output variables, and instead are ranked across the inputs for each output. A model is
generally considered robust if most of the dependencies are characterised by low means and deviations, with
the variations contained within acceptable ranges of the output variables. Appendix D in SI summarises the
investigated ranges and results of the sensitivity analysis.

Intervention strategies
International travel restrictions
In our model, restriction on international arrivals is set to be enforced from the moment when the number of
confirmed infections exceeds the threshold of 2,000 cases. This concurs well with the actual epidemic timeline
in Australia, which imposed a ban on all arrivals of non-residents, non-Australian citizens, from 9pm of 20
March 2020, with a requirement for strict self-isolation of returning citizens. The number of COVID-19 cases
crossed 1,000 cases on 21 March 2020, and doubled to slightly over 2,000 on 24 March 2020, so the 2,000
threshold chosen on our model reflects a delay in implementing the measures. The restriction on international
arrivals is included in modelling of all other strategies, and is not traced independently, as this mitigation
approach is not under debate.
Case isolation
The case isolation mitigation strategy assumes that 70% of symptomatic cases stay at home, reduce their
non-household contacts by 75% (so that their transmission rates decrease to 25% of the baseline rate), and
maintain their household contacts (i.e., their transmission rates within household remain unchanged). The
17

assumption that even relatively mild symptomatic cases are identified and isolated is justified by the practice
adopted in Australia where a comprehensive disease surveillance regime was consistently implemented. This
included screening of syndromic fever and cough in combination with exhaustive case identification and
management, thus enabling early detection (e.g., more than 1% of the Australian population has been tested
for the coronavirus by early April 2020, and the numbers of tests conducted in Australia per new confirmed
case of COVID-19, as well as per capita, remain among the highest in the world) [66, 24, 43, 27].
Home quarantine
In our model of the home quarantine strategy for household contacts of index cases we allow compliance to
vary within affected households (i.e., at the individual level). In our implementation, 50% of individuals will
comply with home quarantine if a member of their household becomes ill. We simulate this as a reduction
to 25% of their usual non-household contact rates, and a consequent doubling of their contact rates within
the household. Both case isolation and home quarantine are assumed to be in force from the first day of the
epidemic, as has been the case in Australia.
Social distancing
If an individual complies with social distancing, all working group contacts are removed, and all non-household
contact rates are set to 50% of the baseline value, while keeping contact rates within households unaltered.
To simulate imposition of the intervention policy by the federal government, the SD strategy is triggered
by crossing the threshold of 2,000 cases (matching the actual timeline on 24 March 2020). An alternative
threshold of 1,000 cases, matching the actual numbers reported on 21 March 2020, is considered to evaluate
a delayed introduction of strong social distancing measures (Appendix H in SI). In our study, we vary the SD
compliance level from 0% to 100% (full lockdown), the compliance level is simply the percentage of individuals
who comply with the measure.
School closures
School closure removes students, their teachers, and a fraction of parents from daytime interactions (their
corresponding transmission rates are set to zero), but increases their interaction rates within households
(with a 50% increase in household contact rates). All students and teachers are affected. For each affected
household, a randomly selected parent chooses to stay at home, with a varying degree of commitment.
Specifically, we compared 25% or 50% commitment, as in Australia there is no legal age for leaving schoolage children home alone for a reasonable time, in relevant circumstances. This parameter range is concordant
with the report of The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), summarising a survey of household impacts
of COVID-19 during early April 2020: the proportion of adults keeping their children home from school or
childcare reached 24.9% [67]. The upper considered limit, a half of parents, accounts for reasonable scenarios
ensuring adequate parental supervision. School closures are assumed to be followed with 100% compliance,
and may be concurrent with all other strategies described above. The SC strategy is also triggered by crossing
the threshold of 2,000 cases. We note that the Australian Federal Government has, so far, not enforced schools
closures, and so we investigate the SC intervention separately from, or coupled with, the SD strategy. Hence,
the evaluation of school closures provides an input to policy setting, rather than forecasts possible epidemic
dynamics.
Compliance
The agents affected by various compliance choices are determined in the beginning of each simulation run,
with dependency between voluntary measures that does not allow an individual to be compliant with home
quarantine if they are not also compliant with case isolation. Then the relevant changes in contact behaviour
are applied to the selected agents in every 12-hour cycle. The restrictions are applied in a specific order: CI,
HQ, SD, SC, with only the most relevant distancing assigned during each simulation cycle. For example, if
a student is ill and in case isolation, the contact reduction factors associated with home quarantine, social

measures. The micro- and macro-distancing parameters defining the levels of compliance, together with the
affected non-household and household contacts are summarised in Table 2.
Duration of measures
While the case isolation and home quarantine strategies are assumed to last during the full course of the
epidemic, we vary the duration of SD and/or SC strategies across a range of intervals, with a specific focus
on 49 and 91 days, that is, 7 or 13 weeks.

COVID-19 pandemic in top 8 affected countries and Australia

As of 21 March 2020, when significant intervention measures were introduced in Australia, over 285,000 cases
have been confirmed worldwide, causing more than 11,500 deaths; and in a month, by 23 April, the total
number has grown to exceed 2.628 million cases, with more than 183,400 deaths [68, 27]. By 21 March 2020,
the disease established a sustained local transmission in many countries around the globe, with more than
180 countries and territories affected, including Italy, Spain, Iran, the United States, Germany, France, and
South Korea as the top eight affected nations [68, 27].
The scale of the COVID-19 pandemic has grown several orders of magnitude in a matter of weeks, from
hundreds to thousands to tens of thousands, with the rate of these transitions varying across countries. Of
particular interest to our study is the time periods when the epidemics are sustained locally in these countries,
but before the effects of adopted intervention strategies are fully felt. One immediate observation is that
during this period, the growth rate of cumulative incidence in many of the traced national epidemics is
averaging within the range between 0.2 and 0.3 per day, that is, there are 20% to 30% daily increases in new
cases on average. This is particularly evident for Spain, France, and Germany (Supplementary Fig. 8), as well
as China, Iran and Italy (Supplementary Fig. 7). These average estimates provide approximate “invariants”
and reduce uncertainty around key epidemiological parameters, required to calibrate disease transmission
models, before investigating possible effects of various intervention policies.
Supplementary Figures 7 and 8 trace cumulative incidence C, incidence, and daily growth rate of cumulative incidence Ċ = [C(n + 1) − C(n)]/C(n), for time step n, for the top eight affected countries (as
of 21 March 2020): China, Iran, Italy, South Korea (Supplementary Fig. 7), Spain, Germany, France, USA
(Supplementary Fig. 8). The time series begin from the day when the total number of confirmed cases
exceeds five. Supplementary Figure 9 traces these time series for Australia. We reiterate that the fraction
of imported cases in the overall transmission has been fairly high in Australia, dominating the community
transmission, and so we paid particular attention to the daily growth rate in countries where the disease
was also introduced predominantly through the air travel (i.e., down-weighting the rates in China and South
Korea).

B

Natural history of disease

The natural history of disease is a description of the disease progression over time from exposure to recovery,
in a single individual and in the absence of treatment. In the past, the AceMod simulator has been used
to model pandemic influenza within Australia, and here we detail modifications of the natural history aimed
to account for COVID-19 specifics, captured in AMTraC-19. We define several agent states: susceptible,
latent, infectious symptomatic, infectious asymptomatic, and recovered. Consequently, the natural
history model considers three distinct phases. The first phase is the latent period during which individuals are
infected but unable to infect others, set in the COVID-19 model as two days. The second phase is the period
characterised by an exponentially increasing infectivity, from 0% to 100% over three days (see Supplementary
Fig. 10). The day on which an individual becomes ill is chosen probabilistically: 30% of agents will change
their state to symptomatic one day after exposure, 50% after two days, and the remaining 20% will become
symptomatic on day three. In order to reflect the presence of mildly symptomatic cases, the model does
not follow a canonical definition of an incubation period (the period between exposure to an infection and
the appearance of the first symptoms). Instead, it distributes the onset of symptoms across the agents, and
increases their infectivity to a peak over a number of days. The time to peak, five days, is chosen to align
with an empirically estimated average incubation period, while mild symptoms may be detectable even before
the peak. Upon reaching its peak, the infectivity decreases linearly over 12 more days (third phase), until
the recovery, with immunity, occurs after 17 days. Finally, we assume that asymptomatic cases are 30% as
infectious as symptomatic cases. Unlike influenza, where we assume that the asymptomatic fraction is the
same for adults as for children, for the SARS-COV-2 coronavirus we assume that while 67% of adult cases

Supplementary Figure 10: Model of the natural history of COVID-19. Profile of the infectivity, for both
symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. After two days, individuals become infectious, with the infectivity
rising exponentially until its peak at five days. After this peak, the infectivity linearly decreases, with full
recovery occurring at 17 days. At comparable points within the natural history of disease, asymptomatic
individuals are 30% as infectious as symptomatic individuals.

C

Transmission model and reproductive number

The primary dynamics of AMTraC-19 are the infection transmissions. At each time-step the simulator
determines the probability of infection for an individual, based on the infection levels in each of their mixing
contexts. At each time step we consider all daytime or all nighttime contexts. Let Xi (n) be a random variable
describing the state of individual i at time step n. At each time step we calculate pi (n) = P (Xi (n) =
latent|X i (n − 1) = susceptible), the probability that a susceptible individual is infected at n. Each
individual belongs to a number of mixing groups with which an agent interacts, denoted g ∈ Gi (n), as well
as an associated static set of agents Ag . We define the context-dependent probability pgj→i that infectious
individual j infects susceptible individual i in context g in a single time step. The probability that a susceptible
agent i is infected at a given time step n is thus calculated as:


Y
Y

pi (n) = 1 −
(1 − pgj→i (n)) .
(2)
g∈Gi (n)

j∈Ag \i

We also define a scaling factor κ (proportional to the reproductive number R0 ), as a free parameter which
allows us to vary the contagiousness of simulated epidemic scenarios:
g
pgj→i (n) = κ f (n − nj | j) qj→i

(3)

g
where nj denotes the time when agent j becomes infected, and qj→i
is the probability of transmission from
agent j to i at the infectivity peak, derived from the transmission or contact rates. The function f : N → [0, 1]
represents the infectivity of case j over time: f (n − nj | j) = 0 when n < nj , implementing the profile shown
in Supplementary Fig. 10.
This model assumes that for all contexts, the probabilities of infection over a given time period are known.
In cases where this information is unavailable, we instead utilise contact rates reported and calibrated in
previous studies. Thus, a majority of the transmission and contact probabilities follow previous work on
pandemic influenza [69, 44, 18, 36, 19, 20], see Supplementary Tables 9 and 10 in Appendix E. Full details
regarding their application can be found in [19].
In this study we used “the attack rate pattern weighted index case” method to calculate R0 [15, 22]. The
method is based on age-specific attack rates, computed as averages over many simulation instances, in order

to reduce the bias in determining a typical index case, present due to population heterogeneity. As argued
in [70, 22], given the correlation between age group and population structure, the age-stratified weights,
assigned to secondary cases produced by a sample of index cases, improve the estimation of the reproductive
number R0 . Possible outliers were removed by the interquartile (IQR) method, using 1.5 IQR rule, which
makes no assumptions about an underlying distribution. Five age groups were used: [0–4, 5–18, 19–29,
30–64, 65+], with the age-dependent attack rates [0.02, 0.04, 0.18, 0.58, 0.18], producing the corresponding
age-dependent reproductive numbers: [1.16, 3.44, 2.63, 2.65, 3.35], with the weighted average of the adjusted
reproductive number R0 = 2.77, with 95% CI [2.73, 2.83], constructed from the bias corrected bootstrap
distribution (sample size 6,315).

Results of sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity of the model

Results of the local sensitivity analysis are summarised in Supplementary Table 3. The analysis shows that
the mean values µ∗2,1 and µ∗2,2 , measuring the influence of the recovery period on R0 and Tgen respectively,
are larger than the means of the other responses |Fi,1 | and |Fi,2 |. This indicates that the reproductive ratio
and the generation period are most sensitive to changes in the recovery period (x2 ). Given the range of the
recovery period, varied between 7 and 21 days, each discretisation step ∆ = 0.1 corresponds to the recovery
period’s change of 1.4 days. For each 1.4-day variation, the reproductive ratio changes by 0.279 on average,
resulting in the mean response value µ∗2,1 = 2.79. Over the ten steps, these variations extend the reproductive
ratio by approximately 0.2 to 0.4 per step, from R0 = 1.81 (x2 = 7 days) to R0 = 4.59 (x2 = 21 days), mostly
linearly, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 11.b. Similarly, these variations (linearly) extend the generation
period by approximately 0.4 to 0.6 per step, from Tgen = 5.51 (x2 = 7 days) to Tgen = 11.01 (x2 = 21 days),

25

Supplementary Fig. 11.b. For each discretisation step, the estimates of R0 and Tgen are produced by “the
attack rate pattern weighted index case” method described in section C, with n = 6, 655 runs on average.
Changes in the other input parameters result in smaller effects on R0 and Tgen , as shown in Supplementary
Fig. 11. Overall, despite the sensitivity of the first two output variables to changes in the recovery period
(x2 ), their variations are within the expected ranges, demonstrating robustness of the model in terms of the
reproductive ratio and the generation period.
The other two output variables, the daily growth rate of cumulative incidence at day 50, Ċ, and the attack
rate in children, Ac , show small sensitivity to all input parameters, indicated by the low means µ∗i,3 and µ∗i,4 .
The asymptomatic infectivity (x3 ) is the parameter influencing the growth rate Ċ slightly more than other
inputs. In response to varying x3 , the daily growth rate at day 50 changes between 0.11 and 0.19, which is
an acceptable range, see Supplementary Fig. 11.c. Not surprisingly, the fraction of symptomatic cases among
children (x5 ) is the parameter with the highest effect on the children attack rate Ac . When x5 is varied, the
attack rate in children changes between 2% and 11%, again within an acceptable range, see Supplementary
Fig. 11.e. Thus, all input parameters are weakly influential with respect to output variables y3 and y4 .
Supplementary Figure 11 shows results of the sensitivity analysis of the model, in terms of five input
parameters: the time-to-peak (days, x1 ), the recovery period (days, x2 ), the probability of transmission for
asymptomatic agents. i.e., asymptomatic infectivity (x3 ), the fraction of symptomatic cases in adults, i.e.,
symptomatic adults (x4 ), and the fraction of symptomatic cases in children, i.e., symptomatic children (x5 ).
For each of the input parameters, we trace two output variables which are most affected by this specific input,
selected based on ranking of responses |Fi,j | using the means µ∗i,j , as reported in Supplementary Table 3.
These dependencies are mostly linear, and the output variables are bounded within their anticipated ranges,
indicating robustness of the model.
Supplementary Table 4 summarises results of the global sensitivity analysis using the Morris method,
carried out with r = 20 repeats and k = 5 inputs, resulting in 120 parameter combinations, i.e., r(k + 1),
with inputs varied over l = 10 discretisation levels. When estimating R0 and Tgen for each parameter
combination, we use “the attack rate pattern weighted index case” method described in section C, with
n = 6, 702 runs on average. For other two output variables Ċ and Ac , we run simulations m = 10 times for
each parameter combination, averaging the results over these runs before computing the sensitivity effects.
In concordance with the LSA, the reproductive ratio R0 and the generation period Tgen are most sensitive
to changes in the recovery period, but also stay within the expected ranges (e.g., R0 varies between 1.33 and
4.96, and Tgen varies between 3.78 and 11.79). The daily growth rate of cumulative incidence at day 50,
Ċ, and the attack rate in children, Ac , show small global sensitivity to all input parameters, despite strong
parameter interactions affecting Ac , as evidenced by the higher global σi,4 .
In summary, the analysis shows that the model is robust to changes in the input parameters, with the
highest sensitivity detected in the reproductive ratio and the generation period, in response to the recovery
period. Even for the most affected variables, the resulting variations are limited within their expected ranges.

D.2

Sensitivity of the model outcomes

We also investigate whether the model outcomes are sensitive with respect to three context-dependent microdistancing levels: within households, community, and workplace/school environments. Two specific targets
are considered:
(i) the epidemic dynamics traced along 90% SD compliance,
(ii) the transition across the levels of SD compliance, in the range between 70% and 80% levels.
The epidemic dynamics traced along 90% SD compliance is of primary relevance (cf. Fig. 3 of the main
manuscript), and so sensitivity of the corresponding outcomes, registered at the end of suppression, is important to establishing the applicability range of the model. The transition in the range between 70% and 80%
levels is our main policy-informing result (cf. Fig. 4 of the main manuscript), and its robustness is crucial for
our study. For each target, the output variables of interest include the prevalence and cumulative incidence,
registered at the end of simulated suppression period.

Supplementary Figure 11: Local sensitivity dependencies of the two most affected output variables
for each input parameter. For each xi , the output variables yj with the two highest mean values µ∗i,j are
shown, cf. Supplementary Table 3. The default value of each input parameter is shown with a vertical line.
Source data are provided as Supplementary Data 1.
Each level of micro-distancing is varied by 5% within a 50% range, in proximity of the default values,
specified in Supplementary Tables 5 and 6. Using discretisation step ∆ = 0.1 and 10 runs per step, we
compute the corresponding responses of prevalence and cumulative incidence under 90% SD compliance
(Supplementary Table 5), as well as the responses of the difference between the outcomes under 70% and
80% SD compliance, for both prevalence and cumulative incidence (Supplementary Table 6).
We conclude that both targets are much more sensitive to variations in the micro-distancing levels within
the workplace/school environments, and least sensitive to micro-distancing within households. Importantly,
the sensitivity dependencies are linear around the default values of input parameters, as shown in Supplementary Figures 12 and 13. This indicates that the model outcomes quantifying the contribution of social
macro-distancing to the disease control are robust to the levels of micro-distancing, within certain levels.
The onset of non-linearity, seen in Supplementary Figures 12.b and Fig. 12.c, as well as in Supplementary
Figures 13.b and 13.c, marks the range of applicability in terms of the corresponding micro-distancing parameters. Specifically, the levels of micro-distancing within the workplace/school environments should not
exceed 25% (Supplementary Figures 12.c and 13.c), and within the community should stay below 60% (Supplementary Figures 12.b and 13.b), as going beyond these levels increases the sensitivity of the results in a

non-linear fashion.
This is further confirmed by the global sensitivity analysis carried out using the Morris method, applied
to reduced parameter ranges for the community and workplace/school environments. For each target, the
analysis uses r = 20 repeats and k = 3 inputs (varied over l = 10 discretisation levels), resulting in 80 =
r(k + 1) parameter combinations, each simulated m = 10 times. These results, summarised in Supplementary
Tables 7 and 8, show that the targets are least sensitive to micro-distancing within households. Another
notable observation is that there are limited interactions among micro-distancing parameters, as evidenced
by moderate values of σ. Importantly, the model outcomes are robust to globally varying micro-distancing
in all social contexts, when these variations are within the identified ranges of applicability.

Population generation, demographics and mobility

Prior to the AMTraC-19 simulations, a surrogate population is generated to match coarse-grained distributions arising from the 2016 Australian census, published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).
In generating this surrogate population, we use Statistical Areas (SA1 and SA2) level statistics, comprising
age, household composition and workplaces. Individuals in the population are separated into 5 different age
groups: preschool aged children (0-4), children (5-18), young adults (19-29), adults (30-65) and older adults
(65+). Along with these assigned characteristics, individuals are assigned a number of mixing contexts based
on the census data. The model uses a discrete-time simulation, where each simulated day is separated into
two distinct portions: ‘daytime’ and ‘nighttime’. In the daytime, workplace and school-based mixing are
considered, whereas nighttime mixing considers the household transmissions, as well as other local spread at
the neighborhood (SA1) and community (SA2) levels.
The population generation begins with the contexts needed for nighttime mixing, which can be thought of
as “home regions”. The simulation iterates through each SA1, creating a cumulative density function (CDF)
describing the size and type of households, based on two dependent probability distributions defined by the
ABS. Given this CDF, the procedure begins to randomly generate households, with the generation of agents

31

occurring during this process. Once a household is generated for an SA1, agents are generated to match the
size and type of the household (e.g., a single parent family of size four will generate one adult and three
children). In order to generate attributes for this surrogate population, the simulation then reads in CDFs
describing the population statistics of the given SA, with each of these agents being assigned some attributes
based on these population distributions.
Following the population of the home regions, the simulator assigns work and school regions to individuals
within the population. This process is based on the “Travel to work” data published by the ABS, which
defines a number of individuals N living in home region i and working in region j. In order to satisfy each
of these “worker flows”, a number of unassigned working-age individuals (19-64 years old) in region i is
selected at random and assigned to work in location j. School allocation, on the other hand, is somewhat
more complicated as the detailed data about student home locations are not available from the ABS. Instead,
we use the available data from the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA),
detailing the locations of schools, along with a proximity based model which biases children allocation towards
closer schools. More detail about student allocation can be found in previous studies [20].

G

Effects of school closures

Here we compare effects of school closures, added to the case isolation and home quarantine, for two levels
of parents’ commitment to stay home: 25% and 50%. That is, the proportion of children supervised at
home during school closure by one of their randomly chosen parents varies from 25% to 50% (Supplementary
Fig. 14). Focussing on the 25% commitment, we also trace the effects of school closures for two specific age
groups: children and individuals over 65 years old (Supplementary Figures 15 and 16 respectively).
At this stage we revisit school closures in context of social distancing. As shown in Supplementary
Fig. 17, addition of the SC strategy to SD set at 70% generates a reduction in incidence, albeit not lasting
and progressing at a higher level than such reductions observed at 80% and 90% SD levels, coupled with
school closures. This suggests that another potential but transient benefit of school closures is that it may
“compensate” for about 10% lack of SD compliance.

Model validation
A delayed introduction of strong social distancing measures

On 21 March 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Australia crossed 1,000. This coincided with
the ban on all international arrivals of non-residents, non-Australian citizens, put in place the night before.
The primary scenario considered in this study introduces a social distancing policy, at varying degrees of
compliance, triggered by crossing the threshold of 2,000 confirmed cases, exceeded in Australia three days
later, on 24 March 2020, when strong measures (e.g., closures of non-essential services and places of social
gathering) have been introduced. The primary scenario traced at 90% SD, coupled with case isolation and
home quarantine, is well-aligned with the actual epidemic timeline in Australia, as shown in Fig. 3 of the main
manuscript, especially in terms of prevalence (Fig. 3.b) and cumulative incidence (Fig. 3.c). The actual daily
incidence data (Fig. 3.a) are more noisy, having been affected, in particular, by separate clusters linked to
infected cruise ships passengers. For example, by 18 April 2020, more than 600 COVID-19 cases in Australia,
i.e., 10% of total cases at the time, have been linked to the Ruby Princess cruise ship from which 2,700
passengers were allowed to disembark on 19 March [71]. Despite the discrepancy in tracing the daily cases,
our model accurately predicted timings of the incidence peak (Fig. 3.a) and prevalence peak (Fig. 3.b). In
addition, the actual SD levels vary across time, and have been complemented by other surveillance, distancing
and intervention measures, e.g., hotel quarantine of international arrivals, meticulous testing of health care
workers, inter-state border closures, etc., which are not part of our model. To re-iterate, the model was
calibrated by 24 March 2020, and the comparison across the SD levels pointed to 90% SD as the closest
match, but did not change the model parametrization, highlighting its robustness and predictive power.
To evaluate a delayed introduction of strong social distancing measures, we compare these two thresholds,
separated by three days, while keeping all other parameters unchanged. Referring to Supplementary Fig. 18, a

delayed response results in higher epidemic peaks, doubling the prevalence in comparison with the alternative
scenario (Fig. 18.b), across different levels of compliance. The cumulative incidence for 90% SD nearly doubles
as well, from around 5,000 total cases, to about 9,000 (Supplementary Fig. 18.c).
We also observe that a three-day delay in introducing strong social distancing measures results in an
approximately four-week lengthening of the required suppression period, confirmed by separate runs with
a longer suppression duration (Supplementary Table 11). The resultant difference (i.e., delay) averages in
23.56 days, with standard deviation of the difference estimated as 11.167 days.

Forecasting

This model has been used in Australia in a now-casting mode during the period since 24 March 2020. In the
simulation timeline, the threshold of 2,000 cases is crossed on day 50, and if this is aligned with 24 March
2020 on the actual timeline, one may see that the incidence along the 90% SD curve starts to reduce from
day 59 (aligned with early April 2020), Fig. 3.a of the main manuscript, and the prevalence peak is reached
around days 62–65 (aligned with 5–8 April 2020), Fig. 3.b.
The early projections of the timing of actual incidence and prevalence peaks, as well as three-month
ahead forecast of the cumulative incidence in Australia to approach the range of 8,000–10,000 total cases,
have shown a good accuracy, validating the model. Specifically, the agreement between the actual and
simulation timelines appears to be the strongest for 90% SD compliance, applied from 24 March 2020 (i.e.,
primary scenario with 2,000 cases), following a period of weaker compliance between 21 and 24 of March
2020. The predicted cumulative incidence at the end of the suppression period, which maps to the end of
June, averages 9,122 cases with 95% CI [8,898, 9,354], and the range over 20 runs is 8,313 – 10,090 (see
Source Data file). The actual number of total cases in Australia on 30 June 2020 is reported as 7,834 [26].
Significant levels of compliance have been confirmed by the Citymapper Mobility Index, which collates
the usage of the Citymapper app, a worldwide public transit app and mapping service which integrates
data for all urban modes of transport, for planning public transport, walking, cycling, and micromobility
data [72]. These data allow for approximating the extent of social distancing compliance, showing, by the
26th March 2020, a reduction of 80% from the normal mobility levels for both Sydney and Melbourne. There
was a relatively steep drop in mobility to this level, noting that the number of trips taken by residents of
Sydney and Melbourne was around 50% just five days prior. Since this drop to mid-April, the levels of
compliance have remained relatively constant at 80–90%, peaking at 90% for both Sydney and Melbourne
on the 10th April 2020. Comparable levels of social distancing were also inferred from the anonymised
and aggregated mobile phone location data of several million Australians, provided in early April 2020 by
Vodafone, a multinational telecommunications company, to the Australian federal government. These data

37

showed a reduction of 83% from the normal mobility levels for Sydney, and 82% for Melbourne [73]. A
national online survey of 1,420 Australian adults, carried out between 18 and 24 March 2020, found that
over the last month 93.4% of respondents followed at least one of six avoidance-related behaviors [74]. In
addition, the ABS survey taken during 1-6 April 2020, showed that during the preceding four weeks, 88.3%
of Australians have been avoiding public spaces (and public events), 98.4% have been keeping distance from
people, and 86.6% cancelled personal gatherings (e.g., with friends or family) [67].
We point out that in Australia, the healthcare sector alone comprises about 6% the population, with accommodation and food services reaching up to 3.6%, while transport, postal and warehousing sector occupies
2.6%, and electricity, gas, water and Waste services add another 0.6% [75]. Thus, assuming that a substantial
fraction of employees delivering these essential services cannot work from home, the highest level of social
distance compliance would not exceed 90%.

Comparison of SD compliance levels across several state capitals

Differences between 70% and 90% SD compliance levels are visualised in choropleth maps of four largest
Australian Capital Cities: Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth (Supplementary Fig. 19). These maps
contrast prevalence numbers resulting from these two compliance levels at day 60.

Fractions of symptomatic cases across mixing contexts

Supplementary Table 12 summarises fractions of symptomatic cases for the considered scenarios, across
mixing contexts: households (HH), household clusters (HC), census districts (CD), statistical areas (SA2),
working groups (WG), classrooms (CL), grades (GR), schools (SCH). Notably, a stronger compliance with
social distancing, in addition to case isolation and home quarantine, increases the household fraction from
30.48% (the household fraction under case isolation and home quarantine) to 47.79% (the household fraction
under full lockdown). This is compensated by the corresponding decreases in the infections acquired at the
workplace: from 17.01% to 6.98%, as well as in the school environments: from 12.41% to 6.20%.

Supplementary Figure 18: Effects of delays. A three-day delay in introducing strict social distancing
doubles the disease prevalence. A comparison of social distancing (SD) strategies, coupled with case isolation,
home quarantine, and international travel restrictions, across different compliance levels (70%, 80% and
90%). Two scenarios are contrasted: primary scenario with the threshold set at 2,000 cases (matching actual
numbers on 24 March 2020), and the alternative threshold of 1,000 (matching actual numbers on 21 March
2020). Duration of each SD strategy is set to 91 days (13 weeks), shown as a grey shaded area for the
primary threshold (2,000 cases), and with vertical dashed lines for the alternative threshold (1,000 cases).
Case isolation, home quarantine, and restrictions on international arrivals are set to last until the end of each
scenario. Traces include a incidence, b prevalence, c cumulative incidence, and d the daily growth rate of
cumulative incidence Ċ, shown as average (solid) and 95% confidence interval (shaded) profiles, over 20 runs.
The 95% confidence intervals are constructed from the bias corrected bootstrap distributions. The alignment
between simulated days and actual dates may slightly differ across separate runs.
