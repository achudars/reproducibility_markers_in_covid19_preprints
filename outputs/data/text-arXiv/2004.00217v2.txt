Abstract

COVID-19, a member of corona virus family is spreading its tentacles
across the world due to lack of drugs at present. However, the main
viral proteinase (Mpro/3CLpro) has recently been regarded as a
suitable target for drug design against SARS infection due to its vital
role in polyproteins processing necessary for coronavirus
reproduction. The present in silico study was designed to evaluate

studies were conducted by using 1-click dock and swiss dock tools.
Protein interaction mode was calculated by Protein Interactions
Calculator.The calculated parameters such as binding energy, and

Introduction
COVID-19 is easily transmissible and it has
already been spread worldwide. Symptoms

are flu-like and can include fever, muscle
and body aches, coughing, and sore throat.
Symptoms may appear 5-6 days after

infection. As of March 20h, 2020, over
243,000 cases of COVID-19 have been
confirmed worldwide, over 10,000 of which
have resulted in death. At present, no
specific therapies for COVID-19 are
available and research regarding the
treatment of COVID-19 are infancy.
However, the measures that have been
implemented remain limited to preventive
and supportive therapies, designed to
prevent further complications and organ
damage [Morales et al., 2020]. Some
preliminary studies have investigated
potential combinations that include anti
malarial drug chlorouinone, and anti-HIV
vaccines can be used to treat COVID-19
infections.
A
separate
investigation
performed by Lu (2020) indicated that
among
4
tested
drugs
(nelfinavir,
pitavastatin, perampanel, and praziquantel),
nelfinavir was identified as the best
potential inhibitor against COVID-19.
The main protease (Mpro)/chymotrypsinlike protease (3CLpro) from COVID-19,
represents a potential target for the
inhibition of CoV replication [Lu, 2020]. It
was observed that genome of CoV encodes
two proteins ppla and pplb which are
involved in spike, membrane, envelop,
nucleoprotein, replicase, and polymerase
activity of viruses. This function is
performed
by
main
protease
(Mpro/3CLpro) (Liu and Wang, 2020). The
Mpro has 3 structural domains; domain I
(residues 8 - 101) and domain II (residues
102 - 184) both have beta barrel motifs
representing chymotrypsin catalytic domain
and domain III (residues 185 - 200) with a
helical structure participates in dimerization
of protein and active enzyme production.
Given its vital role in polyprotein processing
and virus maturation, Mpro is considered to
be a suitable target for viral inhibitor
development as an approach toward SARS.

Environmental factors can greatly influence
the secretion of secondary metabolites from
aromatic plants. Therefore, great attention
has been paid to the secondary metabolites
secreted by plants that may be developed as
medicines [Xang et al., 2018]. Among several
compounds, essential oils, from medicinal
plants, have been reported to have antiviral
bioactivities [Zakaryan et al., 2017]. Essential
oils are highly volatile substances in a
mixture of terpenes, oxygenated derivatives
and other aromatic compounds. Jensenone is
the another component found in eucalyptus
oil from all eucalyptus plants (Goodger et
al., 2016). Jensenone is a natural organic
compound that is a colorless liquid. It is a
cyclic ether and a monoterpenoid. In the
present study, we investigated Jensenone as
potential inhibitor candidates for COVID-19
Mpro. The findings of the present study will
provide other researchers with opportunities
to identify the right drug to combat COVID19.

Result and Discussion
Computational and structural biology
methods have accelerated the discovery of
novel drugs used to treat viral diseases.
Corona viruses (CoVs) are a group of
viruses that infect animals and humans. CoV
infections affect animals in various ways
like: respiratory, fever, cold, digestive, and
liver systems of humans and animals. It is
the main protease (Mpro) found in the CoV
associated with the severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS), which can be accessed in
PDB and was suggested to be a potential
drug target for 2019-nCov [Lu, 2020). In
many viruses, proteases play essential roles
in viral replication; therefore, proteases are
often used as protein targets during the
development of antiviral therapeutics. In
CoV, the Mpro protein is involved in virus

proteolytic maturation and has been
examined as a potential target protein by
inhibiting the cleavage of the viral
polyprotein to prevent the spread of
infection.
The
invention
of
the
Mpro/3CLpro protease structure in COVID19 provides a nice path to identify potential
drug candidates to prevent infection. As
cited by Liu and Wang (2020), proteases
represent key targets for the inhibition virus
replication, and the protein sequences of the
SARS-CoV Mpro and the 2019-nCoV Mpro
are 96% identical, hence host proteases can
be used as potential therapeutic targets. We
followed the structural biology aspects
which focus on the availability and retrieval
of a main protease (Mpro) or 3C-like
protease (3CLpro) receptor structure from
PDB database. The ligand (Jensenone) was
docked to main protease (Mpro) or 3C-like

Previously several ligands and drug
candidate compounds have been selected, as
per criteria of Lipinski’s rule of five. So the
ligands that did not incur more than 2
violations of Lipinski’s rule could be used in
molecular docking experiments with the
target protein. The drug scanning results
(Table 1) show that Jensenone, ligand used
in this study, was accepted by Lipinski’s
rule of five. 1-click docking tool that was
used to find out interaction of inhibitor i.e

Jensenone with Mpro/3CLpro protein
revealed 4 different poses based on the dock
score and the pose with highest negative
values indicated maximum binding affinity
(Table 3). The results of Swiss Dock are
shown in Table 3. The results of Swiss Dock
showed full fitness and Gibbs free energy
predicts docking interactions. The Jensenone
showed full fitness of-2290.07 kcal/mol and
estimated ΔG of-6.03 kcal/mol within active
site amino acids PHE138 and HIS161 of

I and II, the 2 conserved residues His61 and
PHE138 form the catalytic dyad of Mpro.
CAST-P server also revealed the presence of
PHE138 as active site residue of cavity 3 in
Mpro protein (Table 1). Several compounds,
such as flavonoids, terpenoids and phenolics
from essential oils, have been reported to

show antiviral bioactivities [Im et al., 2015;
Zakarayan et al., 2017]. We investigated that
jensenone as potential inhibitor of the
COVID-19 Mpro. Hydroxy groups (-OH),
ketone groups (=O) and ether groups (-O-)
in Jensenone compounds are predicted to
play roles amino acid residue interactions at
the active site of COVID-19 Mpro.

Once we observed that the Jensenone could
potentially bind to Mpro/3CLpro protein,
the next step was to know the binding
mode. In particular, we have used Protein
Interactions Calculator (PIC) to recognize

the
interactions
within
the
bound
complexes. In structural bioinformatics,
predicting
protein-protein
interactions
which stabilize the tertiary and quaternary
structures is an important task. For the top

best four Mpro/ Jensenone complexes with
the best cluster size were subjected to PIC
server and the binding mode (interactions)
of each peptide are given in Table 2. PIC
identified interactions such as hydrophobic
residues interactions, ionic interactions,
hydrogen
bonds,
aromatic-aromatic
interactions
and
aromatic–sulphur
interactions within the peptide-protein
complexes. According to the PIC server
results as shown in Table 4, Mpro/
Jensenone complexes forms hydrophobic
interactions
with
ALA7,PRO52,TRP207,LEU29,TRY126,
PRO184; hydrogen bond interactions with
M4,V18,L30,D10,T16; and ionic interactions
with LYS3,ASP34,ARG38,HIS163 as shown
in Table 4. These residues may be
considered as key or critical and may play a
major role in the protein protein-interaction
and might inhibit the formation of the betabarrel motif of Mpro/3CLpro. Further

studies may help to understand the role of
these residues in drug binding mechanism.
Structural flexibility is one of the important
physical properties that affect protein
conformation and function. Whereas high
increase in kinetics energy and protein
flexibility can disrupt non covalent
interactions as in thermal denaturation; a
sharp decrease in flexibility can also cause
protein denaturation as seen in cold
denaturation. Therefore, proteins need an
essential amount of flexibility to carry out
their native function at physiological
conditions. In this context, an inhibitor by
binding to a protein can alter its flexibility
and decrease its enzymatic activity. Finally,
lack of wet-lab validation is a drawback in
our research and we expect computational
biology analysis and its integration with
wet-lab data can be productive in the
determination
of
potential
antiMpro/3CLpro components.

energies. Therefore, we suggested that may
Jensenone may represent potential treatment
options, and found in medicinal plants that
may act as potential inhibitors of COVID-19
Mpro. However, further studies should be
conducted for the validation of these
compounds using in vitro and in vivo
