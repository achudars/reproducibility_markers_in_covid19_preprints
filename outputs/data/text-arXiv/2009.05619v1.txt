Abstract—The outbreak of covid-19 started many months ago,
the reported origin was in Wuhan Market, China. Fastly, this
virus was propagated to other countries because the access to
international travels is affordable and many countries have a
distance of some flight hours, besides borders were a constant
flow of people. By the other hand, Internet users have the habits
of sharing content using Social Networks and issues, problems,
thoughts about Covdid-19 were not an exception. Therefore, it
is possible to analyze Social Network interaction from one city,
country to understand the impact generated by this global issue.
South America is one region with developing countries with
challenges to face related to Politics, Economy, Public Health
and other. Therefore, the scope of this paper is to analyze the
interaction on Twitter of South American countries and characterize the flow of data through the users using Complex Network
representation and Text Mining. The preliminary experiments
introduces the idea of existence of patterns, similar to Complex
Systems. Besides, the degree distribution confirm the idea of
having a System and visualization of Adjacency Matrices show
the presence of users’ group publishing and interacting together
during the time, there is a possibility of identification of robots
sending posts constantly.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Nowadays, the use of Social Networks to communicate,
share information, thoughts, ideas is very common. Usually,
people is creating posts, writing during the day and tagging
friends, colleagues, etc. Therefore, all this flow of data can
represent the actual status of the citizens. Besides considering
pandemic covid-19, users can reflect what they are thinking,
feeling in front of the global issue related to the pandemic
in their cities, countries. In consequence, this behaviour can
be analyzed to monitor the situation of the population, health
area as Infomediology studies the behaviour through data and
Infovelliance is the application using Computational tools and
directed/undirected sources of data.
Actually, there are many studies related to covid-19 to
analyze people’s behaviour using Social Networks, in particular Twitter because this Social Network presents facilities to
access data and the quantity of data can be representative, i.e.
top concerns of users [1] and focus in countries as scope of

study: Italy [2], Peru [3] , United Kingdom, Unites States [4],
Mexico( citeChireSaire2020.05.07.20094466, Colombia [5],
United States [6], Ghana [7], France [8]. These studies uses
a Data Mining approach and Natural Language Processing
techniques to describe and understand the phenomenon in
many levels: public health, social, mental health and more. By
contrast, this flow of data can include misinformation produced
intentionally through robots. One approach to represent and
analyze this networks of users exchanging data is to use
Complex Networks. Complex Networks had many applications
in different areas: Physics, Biology and Social Sciences. Then,
Complex Networks is a capable representation to study the
interaction of users, i.e. [9] studies the top users in Spain using
Twitter as source data.
The contribution of this paper:
• Select South America as scope and study the covid-19
pandemic influence on this region, open the possibilities
of studying this phenomenon and provide a proposal for
this analysis, section II )
• Introduce Complex Networks to study this phenomenon
getting data from Social Networks and find pattern related
to Complex Systems.
• Find a affordable way to identify network of users with
constant flowing of data, beside the possibility of finding
robots, fake users through this mechanism, section III.
II. P ROPOSAL
This paper is analyzing the interaction of South American
users where Spanish is official language, through Twitter
Social Network. Considering Internet Access and density of
population, the capital of each country were selected for the
analysis.
A. Dataset
The dataset is a collection of tweets from 08 March to 11
July using Twitter API, the table Tab. 1 describes the dataset.
B. Complex Network Construction
The Complex Network was created considering the next
criterion:

For the next experiment, the frequency of @tag users is
considered to set the weight of the edges.

B. Second Experiment

Pick the N1 users with more posts during the period of
study
Search @tag mentions of users inside of the tweets to
find users connection
Find a global list of users and create a set from this
elements to avoid duplicated users
Create a global text with text for each country to find the
users and count them
Create the edges considering the N2 top users and the set
of users with the frequency as weight

The first experiment used N1 = 2000, N2 = 200 and created
a directed graph with no weights related. The graphic 2
introduces the result for Argentina, the number of edges for
this Complex Network is higher than 20,000 and the weight
are very disperse, then a log scale is introduced. In spite
of the adaptation it is not possible to perceive the edges or
connections between users.

A. Firs Experiment
The first experiment used N1 = 500, N2 = 100 and created
a directed graph with no associated weights. The graphic 1
is presenting the results for Peru country, then it is possible
to notice a kind of reticular pattern. Therefore, there is the
possibility of existence of users’ group.

For the previous reason, a filtering is performed considering
the degree distribution(see Figure 3) and only edges with
weight higher than 200 are considered. Besides, it is important
to notice the presence of a distribution similar to Levy’s
Distribution.
The results for Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia,
Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela, besides a
color bar is showed to express the strength or weight of each
edge, see Fig. 4.
Analyzing the present results, it is possible identify network
of users in each country. Besides, Bolivia is a country with less
number of users therefore the filtered matrix is smaller than
other countries. At the same time is possible to identify the line
structures for Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Paraguay, Uruguay
and Venezuela. This lines can mean or represent a group of
users with constant tagging between themselves. Venezuela
calls our attention, considering the size of the filtered matrix
and the extension of the lines, it is possible to identify two

of study.

C. Finding communities
To conduct a deep analysis about the existence of users’
groups an algorithm to find communities is performed over
the complete graph. The results are presented in Table II and
Figure 5.
A previous hypothesis about Venezuela can be confirmed
considering the number of present communities in the interaction of users. And, the images representing the communities
can express a big concentration of nodes in the center respectively showing the tagging of some specific users.
IV. C ONCLUSION
This preliminary study to analyze Twitter interaction of
South American around covid-19 pandemic shows promissory
results. First, a text mining approach is used to process text
and find users. Second a proposal is performed in experiments
sections showing the viability of creating Complex Network
with the proposal. Finally, visualisation techniques are proposed to analyze the matrix adjacency of each country, a
