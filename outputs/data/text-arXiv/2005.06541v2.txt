Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a variable clinical presentation that ranges
from asymptomatic, to severe disease with cytokine storm. The mortality rates also differ across the globe,
ranging from 0.5-13%. This variation is likely due to both pathogen and host factors. Host factors may include
genetic differences in the immune response genes as well as variation in HLA and KIR allotypes. To better
understand what impact these genetic variants in immune response genes may have in the differences observed
in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, a quantitative analysis of a dynamical systems model that considers
both, the magnitude of viral growth, and the subsequent innate and adaptive response required to achieve
control of infection is considered. Based on this broad quantitative framework it may be posited that the
spectrum of symptomatic to severely symptomatic presentations of COVID19 represents the balance between
innate and adaptive immune responses. In asymptomatic patients, prompt and adequate adaptive immune
response quells infection, whereas in those with severe symptoms a slower inadequate adaptive response leads
to a runaway cytokine cascade fueled by ongoing viral replication. Polymorphisms in the various components of
the innate and adaptive immune response may cause altered immune response kinetics that would result in
variable severity of illness. Understanding how this genetic variation may alter the response to SARS-CoV-2
infection is critical to develop successful treatment strategies.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic of 2020 has created a challenge to humanity like none other
in recent times. With its global reach, infections with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) have exacted a tremendous toll from populations around the world. This single-stranded RNA virus
gains access to the host intracellular milieu through interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is expressed on a variety of epithelial and endothelial cells.1 2 Not only is this novel virus associated with
higher mortality than other respiratory viruses, such as influenza, but it also demonstrates a broader variation in
its clinical presentation.3 4 5 6 At disease onset, the symptoms are generally mild and restricted to the respiratory
tract. Still, later, secondary viremia may involve other organ systems expressing ACE-2, including the
cardiovascular, nervous, and renal systems.7 Several patients experience an exaggerated immune response in
the form of cytokine release syndrome.8 9 Despite this, a vast majority of patients with COVID-19 may be
asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic, with the remainder experiencing a range of clinical manifestations,
from moderate-to-severe, life-threatening.7 Mortality rates are high in the elderly and those with comorbidities.
Still, the young and otherwise healthy may also develop severe disease.10 11 There is wide variability in casefatality rates in different populations around the United States (Figure 1A) and the world, with rates as high as
10-13% seen in Italy, England, and Spain, but as low as 0.5-2% in Iceland, Norway and Japan (Figure 1 B). This
variation in the global death toll from this infection, despite testing and reporting biases, may suggest a genetic
component in disease susceptibility. This variation may represent differences in the relative proportions of
tested versus non-tested populations, socio-economic, comorbid conditions, and differential public health
practices. It may be postulated that the disparity in disease severity could be at least in part due to genetic
differences in the innate and adaptive immune responses that individuals may mount to SARS-CoV-2.12
Immune Response to SARS-CoV-2, a general overview
COVID19 symptomatology may be due to a combination of pathogen and host factors. Progression to the more
severe forms of disease not only dependent on pathogen factors such as viral inoculum and virulence but, most
likely, also on host factors that lead to variable immune response. Patients with adequate immune function
likely contain the virus without over-reaction.11 However, in those with severe manifestations of COVID19, a
dysfunctional immune response is frequently observed.11 13 The immune system has co-evolved with a multitude
of historical pathogens, inherent with redundancies to counteract pathogens which have developed multiple
mechanism of immune evasion. This has led to the development of genetic differences and polymorphisms
which may explain the variability of the immune response in some patients within the host immune pathway

(Supplementary Table 1). It is, therefore, critical to explore the intricacies of the pathways of the immune
response to understand the differences in disease severity further.
The immune response to viral infections is carefully orchestrated between the innate and adaptive responses,
and various steps are required to attain control. Failure or suboptimal function of any of the components could
lead to an inadequate response. The innate response initially recognizes pathogen-associated molecular
patterns (PAMP) associated with viruses through pattern recognition receptors (PRR) in the tissue-resident
antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as macrophages and dendritic cells (Figure 2). Examples of PRRs include
Toll-like receptor (TLR) -7 & -13, which recognize single-stranded RNA,14 15 and RNA-sensing retinoic inducible 1
gene (RIG-1). 16 Nod-like receptors (NLR) also help by sensing damage-associated molecular patterns.17
Polymorphisms in the TLR and its downstream signaling molecules such as MYD88 may alter responses
triggered PAMP recognition.18 19 20 The identification of viral pathogens by tissue macrophages initiates a
cascade of cytokine secretion. These cytokines inactivate viral replication through type I interferons (IFN-a &
IFN-b), and help activate the next line of innate immune defense, the natural killer (NK) cells, with their
repertoire of activating and inhibiting receptors. The NK cell receptors include killer immunoglobulin-like
receptors (KIR) and the lectin-like, NKG2 family of receptors, among others. KIR receptors recognize the downregulation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules on infected cells and mediate cytotoxicity. NKG2
receptors recognize non-classical HLA molecules, such as HLA-E.21 22
The innate immune effectors trigger a two-pronged HLA dependent adaptive immune response. The HLA genes
exhibit extreme allelic polymorphisms and present viral peptides on host HLA molecules to T cells to trigger an
adaptive immune response. The T cell response involves both HLA class I and II molecules, which engage
cytotoxic T cell (Tc) and helper T (Th) cell populations, respectively. The latter promotes both the cytotoxic T cell
proliferation, as well as, B cell immunity and generation of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. Polymorphisms in
the HLA molecules result in differential antigen binding and presentation, leading to variability in immune
responses. Antibody production is the task of the B cell arm of the adaptive immune system, which with their
unique B cell receptors, engage antigenic epitopes, either solubilized or directly presented by macrophages and
dendritic cells.23 24 In response, B cells proliferate and differentiate into memory B cells and plasma cells
facilitated by interaction with Th cells, establishing long term humoral immune response.25 This humoral
immune response is crucial to providing control for any viral infection, including SARS-CoV-2. A subset of
patients may not develop long-lasting antibodies and remains unclear if they are at risk for recurrent infection.26
HLA & KIR, the master regulators of immunity

Polymorphisms in the HLA and KIR haplotypes may be responsible for the significant worldwide variability in the
immune response to COVID19. In other viruses, genetic variation among HLA alleles and KIR confer differing
susceptibility. For example, HLA-B*46:01 has been linked to the development and increased severity of SARSCOV-1.27 HLA-A*02:05 may prevent HIV seroconversion, and HLA-B*52:01-HLA-C*12:02 had a protective effect
on the progression of HIV in Japanese patients.28 A study using in silico modeling to predict viral peptide-MHC
class I binding affinity across all known HLA -A, -B, and -C genotypes, has shown that HLA-B*46:01 has the fewest
predicted binding peptides to SARS-CoV-2. This finding suggests that patients with HLA-B*46:01 may be at
increased risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2.29 Thus, global haplotypes variation across populations may partly
explain the difference in illness severity and case-fatality rates. A similar variety may be observed in the KIR
haplotype frequencies. As an example, decreased KIR2DL2 expression has been linked to increased susceptibility
to SARS-CoV-1 30 and KIR2DL3 homozygosity in association with its ligand HLA-C1, is associated with reduced
disease progression of hepatitis C virus.31 The KIR2DL2 gene is present in 46% of Europeans and 80% of
Ethiopians. 82% and 72% of these populations respectively are, at least, heterozygous for its ligand, C1. Similar
HLA alleles and HLA epitope binding site effects have been observed in Dengue fever, transplant outcomes.32 33
34 3536

T cell and B cell repertoire diversity and symptom severity in COVID-19 patients
In addition to these innate immune pathways, adaptive immunity with its T and B cell repertoire diversity is
critical to mount an adequate immune response to viral infections. The mammalian T and B cell repertoire
diversity and ability to recognize pathogen-derived antigens, either directly (B cell receptors) or upon
presentation by HLA (T cell receptors), is derived from a unique process of T and B cell receptor gene
rearrangement. Each of these genetic loci (for the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain and T cell receptor a &
b loci respectively) are comprised of variable joining and diverse gene segments. These segments are
recombined and further modified through the addition of non-templated nucleotides to yield an enormous
repertoire of T and B cell receptor-bearing clones capable of recognizing the pathogens associated antigens with
high precision and fidelity. A decline in repertoire diversity with age may create dominant oligoclonal T and B
cell populations and predispose the elderly to develop symptoms with potentially higher severity of illness.37 38 39
Further, inadequate T and B cell clonal responses in immunocompromised patients may put patients at risk for
insufficient viral clearance, and a prolonged, severe, clinical course. As noted above, patients with COVID-19
develop significant lymphopenia, which may be due to a pan-T cell-suppressive effect. 40 41 42 A reduction in
circulating T cells may represent migration to the site of inflammation, hyperfunction, or direct virally mediated
lethality, and it is known that T cells also express markers of exhaustion in the face of a severe viral infection. 33 43

Inflammatory cytokines during COVID-19
Cytokines are key signaling molecules that orchestrate cellular and humoral immune responses to viral
infections. The cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines is triggered by the engagement of TLR on macrophages
and by NK cells not finding their cognate autologous inhibitory ligands on infected cells. This first wave of proinflammatory cytokines includes TNF-aIL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-15, and IFN-g. These stimulate Th cells to produce
downstream cytokines, such as the pro-inflammatory IL-12, and 17, and the anti-inflammatory IL-4 and 10.
These cytokines provide the critical third signal to trigger both Th and Tc responses to clear the infected cells.
However, a generalized systemic inflammatory response may also be observed in viral infections. While optimal
cytokine secretion will trigger an appropriate immune response, excessive cytokine release, i.e., “cytokine
storm,” may develop in some patients with COVID-19, resulting in fulminant disease with high mortality. SARSCoV-2 may also infect monocytes and dendritic cells, altering the cytokine expression patterns and contributing
to lymphopenia observed. 44 Importantly, this results in overproduction of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and
downstream release of MCP-1, VEGF, and IL-8, eventually culminating in a cytokine storm. Secondary
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis may ensue in these patients. Patients with severe disease have higher
levels of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-a compared with patients with milder disease.45 46 These high cytokine
levels are associated with lymphopenia, with a deficit of both Th, Tc subsets, including naïve T cells and
regulatory T cells.47 48 Elevated cytokine levels are also associated with a decrease in HLA-DR expression.42 In
parallel, the NK cell population is also depleted, which may be the result of viral replication.49 While those with
severe disease have significantly higher SARS-COV-2 RNA load and lymphopenia has directly correlated with viral
load,50 these cytokine differences between moderately and severely ill patients may be due to polymorphisms in
the cytokines involved. A quantitative approach relating differences in cytokine levels and polymorphisms in the
immune response pathways may help identify patients at risk of severe disease.
Immune response as a feed-forward process with signaling & effector components
The immune response to infection may be broadly classified into a signaling component and an effector
component, with the balance between the two determining the eventual outcome (Figure 3). The signaling
function is determined by the cytokine and chemokine secretion by cells of the target tissues and the innate
immune system in response to the infection. The effector component, on the other hand, is characterized by a
pathogen-specific T and B cell response. The ability to maintain control of the virus and successfully recover
from infection, relies on this sequential feed-forward loop nature of the signaling and effector components, with
the virus attempting to inhibit these processes simultaneously. Mathematical models have been proposed to

Immune Response to COVID-19.

understand the quantitative nature of these processes. These models generally study the growth of viruses as an
exponential function of time.51 Viruses enter their host cells, grow exponentially in these cells, and are released
into the surrounding milieu and infect an equal number of cells, where this exponential growth and release are
repeated. Thus, viral replication exhibits exponential growth occurring in an exponentially rising number of
target host cells until a limit is reached by target cell exhaustion. In SARS-CoV-2, because of the widespread
expression of ACE-2, a large tissue reservoir is at risk of infection, amplifying the viral burden manifold over
time. The corresponding immune response to the viral proliferation in the host has multiple components, and
each of these components involves the growth of a population of immune effectors such as dendritic cells, NK
cells, T cells, and B cells. The growth of each of these components will have to reach a threshold in an optimal
period (e.g., by time, t1, t2, t3 or t, t’, t’’, t’’’ and so on for each cell type) to ensure timely and complete
clearance of the virus (Figure 4). As the first line of defense, interferons slow down viral replication.
Concomitantly, NK cells and cytotoxic T cells proliferate and kill infected cells but at different rates than the
virus, driven by their receptor affinities.52 For NK cells, this represents the balance of inhibitory and activating
signals from KIR and NKG2 family of receptors. In some individuals with a KIR B haplotype and a larger
component of activating receptors, this may be a more effective process as opposed to those with a dominant
component of inhibitory receptors. For the T cell responses, the ability of the HLA haplotype of the individuals to
present SARS-CoV-2 derived peptides will be critical. This encompasses both the antigen-binding affinity of the
HLA molecules in the host as well as antigen abundance. The requisite T cell response will be proportional to this
antigen affinity and the affinity of the T cell receptor to the viral antigen-HLA complex. While the NK and T cell
subset proliferation may catch up with an exponentially rising number of infected cells,53 cellular immunity may
eventually fail under the pressure of rapidly replicating SARS-CoV-2, with widespread tissue involvement due to
extensive ACE-2 expression. Thus, in addition to an efficient cellular immune response, a robust humoral
immune response is essential to control and eliminate the infection eventually. The humoral response is
characterized by a proliferating B cell and plasma cell population. Each plasma cell makes large amounts of
pathogen-specific antibodies, which finally allows the host to match the growth rate of the virus and neutralize
the viral particles being generated. Failure or suboptimal rate of any one of these pathways will lead to
inadequate immune response and delay in viral clearance. The suboptimal response will potentially lead to
earlier components in the pathway over-compensating for the failure of downstream mechanisms, caught in a
feedback loop leading to phenomenon such as cytokine storm. The immune pathways are all susceptible to
genetic polymorphisms that have functional consequences, such as variability in cytokine expression, antigenbinding affinities, the strength of receptor ligation and downstream signaling. 54 55 56 Thus, functionally

consequential polymorphisms in these interconnected immune pathways may impede the development of an
optimal immune response to COVID-19.
Estimating the risk of severe illness with COVID19
The immune response to viral infections is a multi-step, precisely coordinated process, which results in viral
clearance through initial innate and later adaptive immune mechanisms. This has been modeled mathematically
to a high level of precision using ordinary differential equations.57 58 59 The immune system behaves like a
dynamical system when both T cells and NK cells are considered.60 61 62 63 Small changes in parameter values, for
instance, in SARS-CoV-2 antigen – HLA binding affinity or the initial IL-6 or IFN- levels produced in response to
infection, may have a profound impact on the eventual clinical outcome.64 Thus, polymorphisms in critical
immune response genes may alter the clinical outcome in a significant manner, mainly when they are
considered together in a comprehensive mathematical description of the total immune response. Quantifying
the number of polymorphisms across variables can, therefore, be used to assess differences in disease risk. As
such, it may be assumed that there are a set of variables (innate and adaptive) that confer an advantage in
terms of viral clearance without cytokine storm and reduce the risk of severe disease, as compared to the set of
variables with no common elements (Figure 5). In patients who have common elements across the entire set of
immune response determinants (overlapping sets), the risk of severe disease may be equivalent when adjusted
for age and comorbid conditions such as obesity, lung disease, and diabetes. Among patients who either have
very few or no overlapping elements, the risk of disease may be significantly different.
Dynamical systems modeling of the immune response to viral infections
These considerations become evident in a thought experiment to model the growth of any virus. If rv is the viral
growth constant (number of virions replicated, for each cell infected, for each iteration of the growth process),
then the total viral burden V at time t can be given by the equation
𝑉! ≈ 𝑟" 𝐻(𝐼𝐸)𝑡
Where H is the target tissue reservoir, and IE is the infection efficiency for that virus (proportion of virions that
end up infecting a new cell). With an initial inoculum of 1000 viral particles, 100 cells (H) get infected (IE=0.1 or
10%); in the second iteration 100000 virions will be produced with 10,000 cells infected, and it this keeps
growing over time t until the limit of H is reached. Interferon (IFN) would directly suppress V, by a fraction, sc

Along with IFN production, a cascade of cytokine signaling will also be initiated, by the tissue-resident dendritic
cells (DC) as well as the innate immune cells migrating into the tissues,
"

𝐷𝐶 ≈ (𝜙) + ∆𝜙)𝑒 *! 𝑉 …….[2]
Where c is the unit production of cytokine per unit increase in V. 𝜙0 are the tissue-resident macrophages, and 𝜙
are the macrophages/inflammatory cells that migrate into the tissues. DC then is the dendritic cell (𝜙)
production of cytokines in response to V. As V gets larger, DC gets higher with t and constitutes the feed-forward
loop depicted in Figure 3 and Figure 6. Unless the overall feedback loop depicted in Figure 3 slows down the
growth of V over time, this can lead to cytokine storm. It is also important to note that DC is a vector matrix
made up of many different cytokines, which all work on their respective receptors in the different target cell
populations.
The cytokines will trigger an NK cell response, which will slow down V. Of note, this variable, and others,
represent growth or change over time and is more accurately referred to by dV/dt. Still, for simplicity, we will
simply consider absolute value Vt. NK cell growth and response may be considered as a function of the sum of
activating and inhibitory receptors, the KIR and the NKG2 family of receptors. These are modeled as vectoroperator equations, where the NK cell with its KIR molecules constitutes a ‘vector,’ and the target with its KIRligand molecules, an operator. The ‘operator’ modifies the ‘vector’ upon interacting with it; for example, it may
either inhibit or activate it. Each individual KIR-KIRL interaction may be described as follows; if an inhibitory KIR
(iKIR) on the NK cell encounters a ligand on its target, this results in an interaction which may be scored,
(−1) × (1) = −1, this will give the NK cell an inhibitory signal, assuming constitutively active basal state for NK
cells; if there is no ligand for an inhibitory KIR, i.e., missing KIRL (mKIRL), the interaction score will be
(−1) × (−1) = +1 because of the abrogation of the inhibitory signal, and finally, activating KIR (aKIR)
interacting with its ligands will be scored, (1) × (1) = +1, when the ligand is present, and (1) × (0) = 0, when
the ligand is absent since no signal is given. Each of these different scores constitute a distinct component of the
total KIR effect on individual NK cells expressing them, and while aKIR and iKIR function independently the
cumulative effect calculated by taking their sum, determining the eventual outcome of NK cell- target

interaction. Activating KIR are not required for a robust NK cell immune response in most instances, evident as
individuals with haplotypes containing no functional aKIR are common and even people with haplotypes that
include aKIR have NK cells in their NK cell repertoire without any aKIR present.65 Depending on the degree to
which the virus down regulates HLA class I molecules to evade Tc mediated killing, it may lead to iKIR-missing KIR
ligand mediated killing or may not through viral immune escape mechanisms such as, no HLA class I down
regulation or HLA decoy expression. Though viral evasion through decoy HLA expression can lead to NK cell
medicated viral killing as in m157 protein expression by mice with mouse CMV infection. M157 has been shown
to strongly associate with an activating mouse LY49 receptor (analogous to KIR) and confer host protection
against MCMV.66 So, the NK cell effect may be summarized by

𝑁𝐾! "" ≈

(𝑁𝑒 +(,-./,-.0) ) ∗ 𝑁𝐾)

In this equation, NKt is the number of NK cells at time t, N is the growth constant for NK cells, S KIR-KIRL is the
sum of activating and inhibitory KIR-KIR L interactions described above. The growth exponent r(NK) is the
cytokine-driven and intrinsic growth rate of NK cells. NKt will reduce Vt by a certain fraction as well, so equation

Here time, t’’ is a later period in time at which the NK cell effect becomes manifest, it is later than the time, t
when viral proliferation begins. This means that the impact of an immune checkpoint triggered later than t (i.e.,
t’ and t’’) will require for those processes to outpace the viral proliferation, which already had a lead on these in
time.
The resulting viral infection and cytokine secretion trigger the adaptive immune response. In the adaptive
response, the antigen-presenting cells (APC) present viral antigens on HLA molecules to the Tc and Th cells. The
unique T cell receptors (TCR) engage the cognate HLA-viral antigen complex. The binding affinity of these
antigens to the HLA molecules varies over a broad spectrum, as does the affinity of the TCR for their cognate
antigen-HLA complexes. A library of viral peptides may thus be presented on HLA molecules and trigger a
polyclonal T cell response. A system of vector-operator matrices with the logistic equation of growth governs the
behavior of each T cell clone.

This equation describes the growth of a single clone of CD8+ Tc cells, where aiI is the binding affinity of the ith
SARS-CoV-2 antigen to HLA class I molecules, mi is the expression level of the protein from which the ith peptide
is derived, and TCR is the binding affinity of the TCR of jth Tc cell clone to the antigen-HLA complex. The
coefficient T represents the growth constant for T cells. Analogously, CD4+Th cells will have apII as the afiinity of
the pth antigen for specific HLA class II molecule, which along with the affinity of the qth TCR for the antigen-HLA
complex, and the expression of this protein determine the final cell number for qth Th cell clone upon
stimulation by target pth antigen. It is to be noted that the starting time here is different, t’’’ < t. Each individual
depending on their HLA types will thus have a different library of SARS-CoV-2 peptides that they will present to
their Th and Tc cells. Further, Th cells modulate Tc and B cell proliferation and differentiation, and therefore
their role may be described as a vector transformation function, changing the jth T cell clone at time t’’’ from

As noted, these libraries of antigens bound to HLA molecules are also modeled as operator matrices, which tend
to vary between individuals with different HLA types and the T cell clones are modeled as vector matrices. The T
cell responses are amplified by the cytokines secreted by the APC growing and generally tend to peak before
plateauing. While the Tc are capable of precisely recognizing infected cells and destroying them, here, the
growth is occurring on a different scale of magnitude altogether, compared to the growth and infection rate of
virions. This differential magnitude occurs because each of the T cell clones starts with a very low number of
cells (theoretically a single cell) when it first encounters cognate antigen.
The adaptive immune component is equipped to deal with rapidly replicating viruses through B cells. Each B cell
makes millions of virus-neutralizing antibody molecules, so once B cell immunity sets in, it may effectively
compete with viral growth through antibody secretion. There, too, an element of time is crucially involved, as
the B cells with the appropriate B cell receptor (BCR) encounter the viral epitopes and get selected for
expansion. This is, once again, a polyclonal process, with the affinity of the kth antigen for the lth BCR driving the

B cell clonal expansion, as in the case of T and NK cells. The expanded B cell clones under the influence of Th
cells undergo somatic hypermutation to further fine-tune the BCR affinity for the kth antigenic epitope yielding a
modified lth BCR’. As these B cells proliferate, they produce large amounts of antibodies against the antigenic
epitope k, Il, which over time, catches up and neutralizes V, even though antibody secretion had started at time
t’’’’ much later than t, when viral proliferation had started.

The above equations outline the two possible innate and adaptive immune response scenarios to a viral
infection that unfolds as time progresses, from t®t’®t’’®t’’’®t’’’’. If this response controls the viral infection
such that the actual viral load, Vt ≈ Vt(IR), with the viral load optimally eliminated, the signaling cascade, DC
(Equation 2), will be dampened and clinical course is optimal. If, on the other hand, Vt >Vt(IR), persistent Vt will
continue to drive the DC in a feed-forward loop culminating in a cytokine storm. In light of the above discussion,
another mechanism for cytokine storm in the former situation (with optimal, timely viral control) will be
autologous tissue destruction perpetuating the cytokine cascade in a different feedback loop. It is important to
recognize that DC is a matrix, where many different cytokines with both suppressive as well as growth
promoting effects are represented.67 Thus the overall effect of DC on T cell or B cell growth is not always in the
positive direction, rather depending on the cytokines dominating in the milieu at any given time one may
observe growth suppression, a phenomenon commonly seen in severely ill COVID19 patients. The whole
immune cascade may thus be mathematically described as a system of matrix vector operator equations. This
schematic depicted in Figure 6.
Inferences from the dynamical systems modeling of viral disease
This exercise demonstrates the multiplicity of responses involved in controlling infections in general, as it is in
this particular case. Further, they indicate the many redundant pathways at work in the immune response to the
same. It is also imperative to note that pathogens have evolved mechanisms to evade the immune response at
multiple checkpoints. Because of genetic variation, not all individuals are equally well endowed with the ability
to control infection. A multi-targeted approach may be needed to overcome the redundancies encountered. The
notion of performing randomized trials with a single intervention tested at a time is at the heart of medicine,
and agents are failing such trials are often discarded for not having met efficacy endpoints. The thought
experiment above suggests that for a pathogen that has the capability of outpacing or disabling several different

immune mechanisms, a combination of many agents and modalities may be required to control the disease.
Attention to this aspect of infectious disease management needs to be given in future trial design.
A quantitative approach, such as outlined here, may be used to identify variation in immune response and
genetic components that may be responsible for the range of illness severity that is observed in COVID-19.
Obtaining a better understanding of the differences in the host response is vital to identify those at risk for
developing severe disease and target treatment strategies.
