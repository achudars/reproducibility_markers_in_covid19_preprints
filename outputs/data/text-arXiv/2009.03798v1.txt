ABSTRACT
Evaluating relative changes leads to additional insights that would remain hidden
when only evaluating absolute changes. We analyze a dataset describing the mobility
of mobile phones in Austria before, during COVID-19 lock-down measures until
recently.
By applying compositional data analysis we show that formerly hidden information becomes available: we see that the elderly population groups increase relative
mobility and that the younger groups, especially on weekends, also do not decrease
their mobility as much as the others.

1. Introduction
The usage data of mobile-phones is used in a variety of different areas, such as during
the COVID-19 pandemic [1]–[11], customer segmentation [12], identification of personality traits and lifestyle [13], [14], the analysis of large social networks [15]–[17],
hotspot detection [18], prediction of movement [19], mode of transport identification
[20], credit scoring [21], disaster recovery [22], [23], analysis of sleeping behavior of the
population [24], migration [25] and land usage classification [26], [27].
The location of a mobile-phone is known for the Mobile Network Operator (MNO)
of the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) network. We have partnered
with an MNO in Austria to get access to such anonymized data. We have defined
an aggregation method to understand the overall aggregated mobility of the whole
population. Our data set as well as the aggregation, anonymization approach and the
various phases of the lock-down are outlined in detail in [28].
With the outbreak of COVID-19 and the subsequent lock-down in Austria, the
mobility behavior of the population has changed significantly. This is reflected in the
mobility data derived from mobile-phone information [28]. To measure mobility, an
appropriate measure needs to be established which reflects the mobility. One possibility

is the radius of gyration (ROG) [29]. It is formally defined below, and refers to the
time-weighted distance of the movement locations to the main location. We compute it
on a daily level. Its unit is meters, and the values are strictly positive. In this work the
analyze the aggregated (median) ROG of the whole population of Austria for various
groups as a time series. The groups are defined by gender- or age groups.
Traditionally, a comparison is made in terms of absolute information, i.e., the ROG
time series values of the different groups are analyzed in their unit of meters. We have
conducted such an analysis [30] which focuses on gender differences.
An alternative is to compare relative information, for example the ROG of the males
with respect to females, or in terms of the ratio males to females. This leads to a
dimensionless time series, and to a different aspect of data analysis which emphasizes
the differences between the individual groups. A joint increase or decrease in both
groups may not lead to a big change of the ratio. On the other hand, the ratio will
change if the values of one group increase, and at the same time they decrease in the
other group, or vice versa. Here again, the relative change rather than the absolute
change is important. For example, if the ROG changes from 1000m to 2000m in one
group, and from 2000m to 1000m in the other group, the ratio would change from
1/2 to 2. The same change could be observed if the absolute values in both groups
would be bigger by a factor of 10. Thus, absolute values are no longer relevant in
this consideration, because a multiplication by any positive constant leads to the
same ratio. This is still trivial in case of comparing two groups, but it is no longer
straightforward when relative information of several groups, such as age classes, should
be compared. Compositional data analysis is devoted to this problem of analyzing
relative information [31]–[33]. In fact, compositional data analysis is frequently used in
geosciences, but also more and more in other fields such as biology [34], bioinformatics
[35], economics [36], marketing [37], medicine [38], etc.
We contribute compositional analysis of the movement data during the COVID-19
analysis which comes to the conclusion that special groups (elderly and young cohorts
during weekends) need an additional caring treatment to improve their security.
This work is structured as follows. In Section 2.1 we give a brief mathematical introduction to compositional data analysis. Section 2.2 provides more details about the
mobile-phone data used and about the quantities derived. In addition to the mobility
measured as the ROG we will furthermore investigate the call duration per day, again
aggregated by the median. Section 3 presents comparisons of the analysis based on
absolute and on relative information, and the final Section 4 summarizes the findings.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Compositional data analysis
From the point of view of compositional data analysis, a composition is defined as multivariate information, consisting of strictly positive values, where the absolute numbers
as such are not of interest, and only relative information is relevant for the analysis
[33]. A composition can be given for example by the median ROG values of different
age categories for a certain day, and every age category is denoted as a compositional
part. We use the notation x1 , . . . , xD for the compositional parts of D categories, and
the composition is written as the (column) vector x = (x1 , . . . , xD )0 . For every day
recorded in our data base we will observe such a composition, which in fact leads to a
multivariate compositional time series. The interest is in relative information in terms

2

of the ratios, and thus all pairs xj /xk , for j, k = 1, . . . , D, should be considered in the
analysis. Obviously, the pairs for j = k are not relevant, and pairs of the reverse ratio
xk /xj do not contain potentially new information. This motivates to consider the logarithm of the ratios, ln(xj /xk ), so-called log-ratios. The reverse ratios have a different
sign, and thus do not need to be considered, and their variance is the same as for
the original ratio. Moreover, the distributions of log-ratios tend to be more symmetric
than without a logarithm [32].
Still, the resulting D(D − 1) pairs ln(xj /xk ), for k > j, only live in a subspace of
dimension ≤ D − 1 [33], and thus it is natural to aggregate this information. Consider
an aggregation

is the geometric mean of the composition x. Then, y1 represents all relative information
about the part x1 to the other parts in the composition in a form of an average of the
log-ratios. This leads to the definition of so-called centered log-ratio (CLR) coefficients
[31]
y = (y1 , . . . , yD )0

with

yj = ln

g(x)

(2)

The vector y contains all relative information about x in the above sense. It consists
of D components yj which are associated with the relative information about the
corresponding part xj . However, it turns out that y1 + . . . + yD = 0, and thus a
representation of data in terms of CLR coefficients leads to singularity [33]. Although
there are ways to circumvent this issue [33], we will proceed with CLR coefficients for
the following analysis for simplicity.
Consider now a multivariate compositional time series xt = (xt1 , . . . , xtD )0 , for the
time points t = 1, . . . , T , and the observations xtj for each part j ∈ {1, . . . , D}.
The time series expressed in CLR coefficients is yt = (yt1 , . . . , ytD )0 , with ytj =
Q
1/D per time point. Since
ln(xtj /g(xt )), with the geometric mean g(xt ) = ( D
j=1 xtj )
this data representation only reflects relative information of the time series, an additional visualization of the absolute time series values can be interesting to get a more
complete picture.
The CLR coefficients result in multivariate data that can be analyzed with the
traditional multivariate statistical methods [33]. A prominent way to represent the
information in a lower-dimensional space is to use principal component analysis (PCA).
Since PCA is sensitive to data outliers or inhomogeneous data, robust versions have
been proposed, also in the compositional data analysis framework [33]. The resulting
loadings and scores are commonly represented in a biplot to get an overview of the
multivariate data [39].

2.2. Mobile-phone data
In this work we analyze two measures obtained from the mobile phone data, the
call duration and the radius of gyration ROG. While the meaning of the former is
straightforward, the latter needs to be defined.
Consider an individual i := i(t) at a certain day t ∈ {1, . . . , T }. For reasons of data
privacy, the index of the individual will change every day. The data is made available
to the researchers already anonymized with a daily changing key.
Furthermore, the current location of the individual’s mobile phone is available at the
time points tτ = t + τt , for a number of time points Tt per day, where τt ∈ [0, 1). The
corresponding x- and y-coordinates are denoted by (ξitτ , ηitτ ). With this information,
tτ can

day t. These coordinates are in the middle of the area covered by all the locations
which were visited during the day and are dominated by the two most prominently
used (longest used) locations: home and work location.
Denote d2itτ = (ξ¯it −ξitτ )2 +(η̄it −ηitτ )2 as the squared Euclidean distance between the
coordinates (ξ¯it , η̄it ) and (ξitτ , ηitτ ). This requires the coordinate system to be local in
order to obtain valid, i.e. less distorted results. Otherwise, a Haversine distance could
be used instead in case of epsg:4326 WGS-84 projection of the coordinates.
The ROG for individual i and day t is then defined as

sP
Rit =

d2itτ
,
tτ litτ

Ptτ

(3)

and it thus represents a distance to the center of all the places of stay during that day
t weighted by the lengths of the stay duration at the different places.
Details are available and especially a description of how the large quantity of data
was handled is available in [28].
Using additional metadata, an individual i can be assigned to a gender group (female, male), to an age group (here we consider the age groups in 15 year intervals:
15-29, 30-44, 45-59, 60-74, and 75+), and to an Austrian district of the daily night location to derive the groups. Since the distributions are generally very right-skewed, we
work with the median per group and day in the following and also ensure k-anonymity
for each one.
The resulting time series can be directly investigated in terms of their absolute
information, and they can be compared to an analysis based on relative information.

3. Results
3.1. Mobility measured by ROG
The results reported in this section refer to the median values of the ROG per group.
To begin with, Figure 1 shows the absolute values for the females (top) and males
(bottom) for different age groups. The legend indicates the considered age groups: 15
for age 15-29, 30 for age 30-44, 45 for age 45-59, 60 for age 60-74, and 75 for age elder
than 75. For all of the following time series plots, the vertical dashed lines indicate the
date March 16th , 2020, when the restrictions came into action, and the date April 6th ,
2020, when they were relaxed. The data considered here are from the period February

1st until August 9th , 2020. The lock-down is clearly visible in the plots by an abrupt
decay of the median ROG values in all age classes for both genders. After the lockdown, the order of the values still remains the same, from the eldest group with the
smallest values, and the youngest group with the highest values, but it is on a much
smaller level. The level then increased more or less systematically until the middle of
June. Afterwards, the level is not changing a lot, it is lower than at the beginning, and
weekly patterns are clearly visible. Note that these weekly time series patterns that
are very regular at the beginning are getting somehow distorted, partially also due to
holidays (April 13th , May 1st , May 21th , June 1st , June 11th ), and they never get back
to this regularity.
Figure 2 focuses on the relative information contained in the median ROG values.
We consider the female age groups and the male age groups separately as two compositions. The plots show the corresponding CLR coefficients for females (top) and
males (bottom). While in Figure 1 we have essentially seen a decline of all values at
the beginning of the lock-down phase, followed by an increase, we did not pay attention how differently the age groups declined and increased. This is the purpose of the
relative view in Figure 2, where we mainly investigate the developments of the age
groups to each other.
In both plots of Figure 2 we can see roughly the same pattern after the lock-down:
the biggest relative changes are visible for the youngest and the oldest age group,
but they go into different directions. While group 15 had the biggest decline, group
75+ increased the values relative to the other age groups. This seems to be counterintuitive, but it can be explained by the fact that the geometric mean also went down
significantly, and the ratio of the values of group 75+ to the geometric mean then even
increased after the lock-down. Another interesting phenomenon is that the groups 60
and 75+ show the biggest increase in mobility (in a relative sense) during the weekends
in this lock-down period. Although on a different level, the values from July show a
similar structure to those from February. It is interesting to note that the youngest

age group 15 shows a somehow mirrored weekly pattern compared to the elder age
groups. This is not visible when looking at the absolute values in Figure 1.
Relative information could also be understood in terms of data proportions. In
particular, one could compute the proportion of a group on the total per time point,
which in fact corresponds to normalizing the data per time point to a value of 1. Such
a proportional presentation is shown in Figure 3 for the ROG values of the female
age groups. Obviously, the information contained in this representation is different
from CLR coefficients which focus on log-ratio information. One can hardly see any
differences between the lock-down period and the remaining period, and thus this kind
of “relative view” is not valuable for the analysis.

the time phases: green before the lock-down, pink during the lock-down period, purple
after lock-down until mid of June, and light-blue after this period. The left biplot for
the females identifies these four periods as clear clusters, while there is more overlap
visible in the right biplot for the males. For the females, the direction of the first PC
(71% explained variance) shows a transition of the relative ROG values from the young
generation (f15, f30) before lock-down to the old (f75) one during lock-down, and then
back to the center. Thus, younger and elder females show a contrasting behavior in
this time period, which was already observed in Figure 2 (top panel). The second PC
(21% explained variance) shows also differences between the time periods, but it also
reveals weekend effects. Especially on Sundays, the mobility for group f15 was bigger
before and after lock-down, but it moved to group f75 during the lock-down phase.
The data structure in the biplot for the males (right plot) looks a bit different, but
leads to similar conclusions. PC1 explains 69% and PC2 25% of the variance. Groups
m75 and m15 have a similarly diverging behavior of Sunday mobility as observed for
the females. The weekdays of the lock-down phase are in the center of the distribution, while for the females they were clearly moved towards group f75. On the other
hand, the weekdays in the first time period (February 1st - March 15th ) are better
distinguishable from the weekdays of the last period (June 15 - August 9); a possible explanation is the fact that the working male population changed the mobility
behavior more significantly than that of females due to home office.
A quite contrasting view is revealed in Figure 5, which shows the robust PCA
results for the absolute values of ROG, for females (left) and males (right). In both
analyses, PC1 explains 98% of the variability, and this direction essentially reflects the
big change of the ROG over this time period. Otherwise, there is not much information
left in these analyses, which reflects the limited usefulness of absolute information if
the task is to compare age groups.

Figure 5.: Biplots of the (absolute) median ROG values for females (left) and male
(right) age groups. Green color for period before the lock-down, pink for lock-down
period, purple after lock-down until mid of June, and light-blue after this period.
3.2. Interaction measured by call duration
Figure 6 investigates the median call duration, reported in seconds, again for the two
genders and the age groups. The absolute values are shown in the upper plot jointly for
males and females. Here we observe the reverse ordering of the age groups compared
to the plots for the ROG values: the lowest values are for the youngest group, and the
biggest for the oldest group. The values of the females are systematically higher than
those of the males. It is interesting to see that the call durations already started to
increase one week before the lock-down. While the ROG time series had their peaks
during the weekend, we have the opposite here. This pattern, however, seems to change
after the lock-down for group f75 (uppermost line), and it went back to normality only
later on.
The bottom plot of Figure 6 presents the CLR coefficients, which are separately calculated for females and males, but presented here jointly for easy comparison. Although
the absolute values of the youngest age group also increased with the lock-down, the
increase was smaller compared to the other groups, which is reflected by decreasing
CLR coefficients. The pattern of f15 and m15 has also an interesting structure: Before the lock-down, the groups had quite different behavior within their gender-group,
but during the lock-down phase they became quite similar. From June on, they show
again a similar behavior as at the beginning. Another interesting phenomenon can be
seen after the lock-down: the two oldest groups show a contrary behavior to the other
groups during the weekends. Their decline in call duration during the weekends was
much smaller than that of the other age groups.
Figure 7 presents biplots of a robust PCA for the CLR coefficients for the female
(left) and male (right) age groups. The coloring is taken as in the previous biplots,
green before lock-down, pink during, purple after lock-down, and light-blue from June
15th onwards. PC1 explains 72% of the variability for the females, 54% for males,
and PC1 and PC2 together explain about 98% variance in both cases. The different
groups which are visible in the biplots are essentially weekend-effects or affects due
to the lock-down. These grouping effects are essentially caused by the youngest and
oldest age groups. When comparing the first observed time period with the last one, we

can find quite clear differences in the corresponding PCA scores. These differences are
essentially caused by the changing contrasting behavior between the youngest group
and the elder groups; groups f75 and m75 (and also m30) do not seem to contribute
to this difference. A possible explanation is the exploration of alternative methods for
communication, especially for the elder groups.
3.3. Interactions between source and destination
It can be recorded who is actively calling a person, and who is receiving a call. The
former person is called source, and the latter destination. Here we investigate the
median ROG values for the different age groups of the females and males. However,
the data set is more complex now, because a person from a certain age group can be
source, while the destination can originate from a different age group. Moreover, both
source and destination will have specific median ROG values.
Figure 8 illustrates these data for four specific cases: source f45 (f45 src) with destination f75 (f75 dst), and source f75 (f75 src) with destination f45 (f45 dst). In both
cases, the median ROG values can be taken from the source group or from the destination group, see also figure legend. Throughout the whole period (here from February
1st - July 26th ), the median ROG values from the source groups (solid lines) have
slightly higher values than those of the destination groups (dashed lines) for the same
age classes, which can be expected because people from the source groups might call
from a place outside their usual environment. While the lines are on a similar level at
the beginning and at the end of the considered period, the weekly periodicity changes,
probably caused by the summer holidays.
In the following analyses we are interested in the similarity of the relative ROG
values in terms of correlations, before lock-down (February 1st – March 15th ) and
after (March 16th – May 31th ). In order to investigate relative information, the CLR
coefficients are computed for a composition with all 25 age combinations of the source9

Figure 9.: Correlations of the CLR coefficients for median ROG values for the female

(right).
destination groups and all 25 age combinations of the destination-source groups, separately for females and males. Figure 9 shows the resulting correlation matrix for
the females as a heat map, left for time points before the lock-down, and right after
lock-down. The row and column labels are referring to the group numbers. For example, src1-3 refers to the time series f15 src – f30 dst, or dst5-1 is the series f75 dst
– f15 src. The heatmaps show that the correlation structure before and after lockdown has clearly changed. Afterwards, there are more blocks with higher (absolute)
correlations, and thus more similarity or dissimilarity between certain age groups. In
general, there is a more pronounced difference after lock-down in the mobility behavior
between the younger and the elder age groups.
3.4. Incorporating spatial location
The mobile phone data also contain information about the location, in our case about
the Austrian political district in which the phone has been used. The Austrian regions
had different restrictions during the lock-down phase, and in particular people from
all districts in Tirol had the strongest movement restrictions. Thus, in Figure 10 we
compare the median ROG values for Kitzbühel, a district in Tirol, and Zell am See,
which is also a rural district but located in Salzburg. The absolute values of the female
age groups are shown in the upper plots, while the CLR coefficients are presented in
the lower plots. Since the same scale is used along the vertical axes, one can clearly see
the difference in mobility during the lock-down period in Kitzbühel and Zell am See,
and this is also visible in the CLR coefficients. For Kitzbühel, there is much smaller
variability of the values during lock-down, and also the relative differences between
the age groups become much smaller. The change in the relative differences is not so
pronounced for Zell am See. This means that also from a relative point of view, the
data structure changes completely in Kitzbühel due to the restrictions.
Figure 11 focuses on the male age group m30, and compares the composition of all

districts in Tirol with that of all districts in Salzburg. The dashed lines refer to the
district capitals (Innsbruck and Salzburg, respectively). These districts behave differently compared to the other districts which are rural with many people commuting to
their work place. The values of the districts in Tirol (except Innsbruck) get closer to
each other after lock-down, and they start to diverge only in the middle of April. This
may be explained by a similar mobility behavior of the m30 group within this period,
probably caused by home-office or reduced working time. This seems different in districts of Salzburg, where the CLR coefficients show more variability after lock-down.

4. Discussion
By analyzing relative changes using compositional data analysis methodologies formerly hidden insights can be identified. In this work of analyzing mobility during the
COVID-19 lock-down measures we see that certain age-groups of the population (elderly, young during weekends) do restrict mobility less than other members of the
population. Especially for the elderly which are at high risk of infections potentially
additional reminders should be sent to adhere to the interventions. Similarly, for the
young groups on weekends additional reminders to use mouth nose protection could
be useful.
