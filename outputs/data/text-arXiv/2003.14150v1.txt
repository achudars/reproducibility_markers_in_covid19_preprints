Abstract— The Coronavirus, also known as the COVID-19
virus, has emerged in Wuhan China since late November 2019.
Since that time, it has been spreading at large-scale until
today all around the world. It is currently recognized as the
world’s most viral and severe epidemic spread in the last
twenty years, as compared to Ebola 2014, MERS 2012, and
SARS 2003. Despite being still in the middle of the outbreak,
there is an urgent need to understand the impact of COVID19. The objective is to clarify how it was spread so fast in
a short time worldwide in unprecedented fashion. This paper
represents a first initiative to achieve this goal, and it provides
a comprehensive analytical study about the Coronavirus. The
contribution of this paper consists in providing descriptive and
predictive models that give insights into COVID-19 impact
through the analysis of extensive data updated daily for the
outbreak in all countries. We aim at answering several open
questions: How does COVID-19 spread around the world?
What is its impact in terms of confirmed and death cases at
the continent, region, and country levels? How does its severity
compare with other epidemic outbreaks, including Ebola 2014,
MERS 2012, and SARS 2003? Is there a correlation between
the number of confirmed cases and death cases? We present a
comprehensive analytics visualization to address the questions
mentioned above. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first systematic analytical papers that pave the way towards a
better understanding of COVID-19. The analytical dashboards
and collected data of this study are available online [1].

I. I NTRODUCTION
The Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak nowadays represents the most critical event worldwide. It has been declared
by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a Global Public
Health Emergency by the end of January 2020, and then
as a global pandemic in March 2020. The impressive fast
spread of the virus is unprecedented and has exceeded all
expectations. The containment of the virus is increasingly
challenging as almost all countries in the world become
infected.
The virus has begun on from Wuhan district in China,
where the first confirmed case was reported to have happened
on November 17, 2020 [2]. Initially, the confirmed cases in
China were continually increasing. On January 31, the total
infections reached a bit less than 10000 confirmed cases, with
214 recovered and 213 reported deaths (2% death rate, and
similar for recovery). Although the Chinese authorities have
taken incremental and prompt preventive measures to avoid
the exponential outbreak, the virus continued to spread not
only within Chinese borders but also worldwide. The virus

was transmitted through travelers around the world. One of
the most dangerous aspects of the Coronavirus is that it has
an incubation period of 2-14 days, during which the patient
transmits the virus without having any symptoms. All these
circumstances have favored the exponential growth of the
infection leading to a world health emergency crisis. As a
consequence, after only two months from the official declaration of COVID-19 as Global Public Health Emergency,
and despite the numerous exceptional preventive measures
that every country has taken to avoid the outbreak, the virus
has contaminated almost all the world countries.
Figure 1 illustrates the evolution of the number of countries that were affected by the Coronavirus outbreak from
January 22 until March 26, 2020, based on the daily report
data provided by Johns Hopkins University repository [3].It
is observed from the figure that the outbreak pick growth
started towards the end of February, which is almost four
weeks since the disease was declared as a Global Public
Health Emergency. Besides Asia, the first continent to be
severely affected, the outbreak has been more generalizing to
other continents during March 2020, putting first Europe into
a crisis, followed by the Americas, and finally the African
countries. At the time of writing this paper, a total of 173
countries are reported to have confirmed cases with different
gravity, while only 60 countries had confirmed cases at the
end of February 2020, and only 25 countries at the end of
January 2020. This means that the increase rate was between
2.4 to 2.9 each month. Almost all countries worldwide are
currently infected, but the impact of the COVID-19 virus has
widely varied between the continents, regions, and countries.
This represents the motivation of this data analytics study.
Our objective is to unveil the secrets of the COVID-19
virus and understand its evolution in the world. We aim to
know the distribution of confirmed and death cases across
the continents, regions, and countries and the correlation
between them. Furthermore, we compare the impact of the
COVID-19 virus with the previous and recent epidemic
diseases that have emerged in the last 20 years, namely Ebola
2014, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS 2012), and
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS 2003) outbreaks.
In particular, we address the following research questions:
How does COVID-19 spread around the world? What is its
impact in terms of confirmed and death cases at the continent,
region, and country levels? How does its severity compare

Evolution of the number of infected countries over time from 22 Jan until 26 March 2020

with other epidemic outbreaks, including Ebola 2014, MERS
2012, and SARS 2003? Is there a correlation between the
number of confirmed cases and death cases?
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
II. R ELATED W ORKS
Since its spread, there have been several initiatives to
investigate the impact of COVID-19 from the scientific
community.
In [4], the authors have proposed to analyze the use
of social media to exchange information about the Coronavirus. They proposed to identify situational information to
investigate the propagation of COVID-19 related information
in social media. They used natural language processing
techniques to classify COVID-19 information into several
types of situational information.
In [5], the authors develop a predictive model to forecast
the propagation of COVID-19 in Wuhan and its impact on
public health by considering the social preventive measures.
Some other researchers, like in [6], the authors have analyzed
the COVID-19 outbreak during its early phases in Italy.
They provided estimates of the reproduction number and
serial intervals. In [7], the authors investigated the impact
of preventive measures, such as social distancing, lockdown,
in the containment of the virus outbreak. They developed
prediction models that forecast how these measures can
reduce the mortality impact of aged people. The authors of
[8] addressed the question about how the virus has spread
from the epicenter of Wuhan city to the whole world. They
have also analyzed the impact of preventive measures such
as quarantine and city closure in mitigating the adverse
impact of the spread. The authors have demonstrated visual

graphs and developed a mathematical model of the disease
transmission pattern. In [9], the author has analyzed the virus
outbreak in Italy based on early data collected to predict the
outcome of the process. He argued that there is a strong
correlation between the situation in Italy and that of Hubei
Province.
Some researchers have attempted to use deep learning
and artificial intelligence in the context of COVID-19. In
[10], the authors have proposed COVID-Net, which is a deep
convolutional neural network for the detection of COVID-19
infection from chest radiography images open-source dataset.
The dataset contains 5941 chest radiography images of 2839
patient cases. In [11], the authors have developed an image
processing technique for the detection, quantification, and
tracking of the COVID-19 virus. They utilized deep neural
network models for the classification of suspected COVID19 thoracic CT features, using data from 157 patients from
the USA and China. The classification area under the curve
(AUC) of the study was found to be 0.996. In [12], the
authors investigated drop-weights based Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNN) and its effect on improving
the performance of the diagnostic of COVID-19 chest Xray. They showed that the uncertainty in prediction is highly
correlated with the accuracy of prediction.
III. DATA A NALYTICS M ETHODOLOGY
In this paper, we propose a detailed data analytics study
about the COVID-19 virus to understand its impact. Besides,
we compare its severity against Ebola 2014, MERS 2012,
and SARS 2003.
To achieve this objective, we have collected data from
authentic sources and widely accepted by the scientific

community. In what follows, we present the datasets used
in this study.
A. Datasets
We searched for datasets that provide credible data about
the COVID-19 outbreak. The 2019 Novel Coronavirus
COVID-19 Data Repository provided by Johns Hopkins
University [3] is the most comprehensive, up-to-date, and
complete dataset that gives daily reports of the COVID19 outbreak, in terms of confirmed cases, death cases, and
recovered cases. Besides, Johns Hopkins University maintains an active dashboard that reports daily updates of the
Coronavirus [13]. Also, the same dataset is being extensively
used by the data science community of Kaggle to develop
several analytics notebooks and dashboard about COVID-19
[14].
Each row in the COVID-19 dataset contains the following
relevant data:
•
Observation date: it represents the date when the
corresponding data row was reported.
• Country: the country from where the data emerged
• Confirmed cases: the number of COVID-19 confirmed
cases
• Death cases: the number of COVID-19 death cases
• Recovered cases: the number of COVID-19 recovered
cases
In addition to this data, we have processed the dataset to
add additional information related to:
• Continent: the continent of the country related to the
collected data. We considered five continents, including
Africa, the Americas (north and south), Asia, Europe,
and Oceania (Australia and New Zealand).
• Region: the region is a level between country and
continent. We considered the following regions in our
study:
(Northern/Southern/Eastern/Western/Middle)
Africa, (Northern/Southern/Eastern/Western) Europe,
(Norther/Southern/South-Eastern/Eastern/Western)
Asia, (Northern/South/Central) America, Arabic Gulf,
Caribbean, Australia, and New Zealand, Melanesia,
and Micronesia.
The mapping between countries and their corresponding
regions and continents was performed using the following
CSV file 1 .
We have also collected datasets for the other epidemic
diseases, namely:
• SARS 2003 Outbreak Complete Dataset [15]
• MERS Outbreak Dataset 2012-2019 [16]
• Ebola 2014-2016 Outbreak Complete Dataset [17]
All the dataset provides time-series information about
confirmed and death cases per country per day during the
observation period, except, the MERS dataset that provides
only the final statistics of the disease for the confirmed cases
(no death cases reports). We could not find any credible data
source for the time series evolution of MERS, neither the
death cases.
1 https://www.kaggle.com/statchaitya/country-to-continent

We have processed these datasets to clean the data and also
add the mapping of the countries to their region and continent
to develop region-level and continent-level statistics. Also,
we have created an all-in-one dataset with all data combined
for comparative purposes.
B. Methodology
In this work, we have used Tableau Professional software to analyze the collected data and develop visualization
dashboards about the Coronavirus disease. Our methodology
consists in creating descriptive models of the Coronavirus
outbreak using statistical charts to understand the nature
of the spread and its impact. We develop our analysis at
three levels, namely, at the country-level, at region-level, and
continent-level. Each level provides different granularities
towards understanding the distribution of the disease around
the world. The descriptive model provides different types of
statistical charts, including bar charts, geographic maps, heat
maps, box plot, and packed bubbles, to represent different
features of the COVID-19 outbreak. We also develop some
predictive models using linear and polynomial regressions
to predict the evolution of the outbreak, given the historical
data.
In this study, we also compare COVID-19 with the other
three most critical world epidemic outbreaks, namely Ebola
2014, MERS 2012, and SARS 2003. We visualize the
difference in terms of the impact of these diseases in terms
of confirmed and death cases, analyze the characteristic of
each disease.
The lessons learned in this data analytics study serves as
a ground for data science for further investigation of the
COVID-19 epidemic outbreak.
IV. R ESULTS
In this section, we will present the results of this data analytics study. The dashboards of this study are also available
online [1].
A. How does COVID-19 evolve?
Figure 2 depicts the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak
in the logarithmic scale during the period from January 22,
2020, to March 27, 2020, i.e., two months period. Let us
consider January as the reference month.
We performed a linear regression analysis on the different
curves shown in Figure 2, and we determined the confirmed/recovered/death/active rates during the observation
periods. These rates are shown in Table I. The rates are the
slope of the regression lines. They are shown as the first
parameter between parenthesis in the table below.
By observing the trend lines of linear regression models on
the different curve at each month, we conclude the following
observation:
• The global cumulative confirmed case rates are 2.54
times higher in February 2020, and 15.67 times higher
in March 2020, as compared to the confirmed case rate
of January 2020.

containment.

This is also confirmed by the ratio between the recovered
rate and the death rate. Comparing the trend death and the
trend of recovered cases, it can be observed that the ratio of
recovered to death rates, was 0.86 (19/22) in January 2020,
meaning that the death rate was a bit higher in January than
the recovered rate. However, in February 2020, the ratio of
recovered to death rates increases to 13.33 (1373/103) and
reaches 3.66 (2906/792) in March 2020. Thus, the general
trend is that the disease is being more controlled in terms
of fatality rates due to increasing emergency procedures that
the different countries have implemented.
The results presented above a coarse grain in the sense that
they related a global assessment of the evolution. However,
the evolution of the COVID-19 infection depends much on
the countries, the region, and the continent. It is, therefore,
important to assess the evolution at these levels to get a
better understanding of it. Figure 4 presents the cumulative
confirmed/recovered/death/active cases reported as of March
27, 2020 for the top-10 countries, then their regions and

Fig. 3. COVID-19 Outbreak in the USA as of March 27, 2020. It is
clear that the Eastern side, and mainly New York are the most affected,
considering it is closer to Europe.

In Figure 4, it can be observed that Europe has the most
significant confirmed cases currently and the most severe
fatality rates, where the maximum reached are the south of

Europe with more than 14000 death cases, among which
more than 9000 are located in Italy. Italy is currently having
the third of fatalities in the whole world.
It is also observed that Oceania and Africa are less affected
by the virus as compared to other continents.
Finally, the distribution of the different cases is illustrated
in the heatmap presented in Figure 5. Dark colors mean a
high concentration of cases, and lighter colors mean smaller
concentrations of cases.
B. How does COVID-19 compare to other epidemics?
In the previous section, we have presented a comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 virus, and we got a better
understanding of how it was evolved and its impact on
the country, region, and continent level. In this section, we
address the question: How does COVID-19 compare to other
epidemics?
Several other epidemics have emerged in the last 20 years,
in particular, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS2003)
in 2003 in Hong Kong, the Middle East respiratory syndrome
(MERS2012) in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East, and Ebola
2014 in Western African coast, namely Guinea, Liberia, and
Sierra Leone. These three epidemics, in addition to COVID19, are the most remarkable world diseases in the last 20
years, which we proposed to compare and analyze.
1) Comparative evolution over time: Figure 6 presents a
dashboard that compares the four epidemic outbreaks. On
the top, we observe the geographic heat map for the four
diseases. It is visually apparent that COVID-19 is the largest
outbreak to a considerable extent, followed by SAR 2003,
then Ebola 2012, and finally, MERS 2001. In what concerns
the number of infected countries, COVID-19 has reached 177
countries, then SARS 2003 reached 36 countries, then MERS
2012 has affected 27 countries, and Ebola 2014 was spread
in 10 countries. The severity and acuteness of COVID-19 are
unprecedented.
We observe in the second row of Figure 6 that while Ebola
2014 has spanned over a significant period from August 2014
until March 2016, it reached only 15249 confirmed cases.
Thus it had an infection rate minimal as compared to the
two other diseases. Besides, most of the confirmed cases
were concentrated in the Western coast of Africa, where the
disease has emerged. On the other hand, SARS 2003 had
a lifetime of five months from March 2003 until July 2003
and reached 8434 confirmed cases with an average of 1686
cases per month, and a pick rate in April 2003, one month
after the outbreak.
It can be observed that COVID-19 is considered as a more
acute specie of SARS 2003, as they both share some common
features, including: (1) both have started from China, (2)
they belong to the same family of Coronavirus syndrome
affecting the respiratory system, (3) they have the highest
contamination rate as compared to other epidemics.
Based on these observations, it seems that the COVID19 containment will take a more extended period for its
complete containment as compared to SARS 2003.

The third row of Figure 6 shows the daily confirmed cases
for COVID-19, Ebola 2014, and SARS 2003. The trends of
COVID-19 are exponential, whereas the trends of Ebola 2014
and SARS 2003 are high at the start of disease then start to
decrease after two months of the first confirmed cases. This
shows that the behavior of COVID-19 is more aggressive as
compared to the other epidemics.
2) Comparative Impact: We address the question: how do
the impacts of the epidemics compare to each other in terms
of confirmed cases and death cases?
Figure 7 shows the comparative impact with respect to
the confirmed cases, and Figure 10 shows the comparative
impact with respect to the death cases, at continent-level,
region-level, and country-level. The blue color refers to the
COVID-19; the red color refers to the Ebola 2014, and the
yellow color refers to SARS 2003.
Looking at the two figures, we can conclude that the
COVID-19 is exceptionally more aggressive in terms of
confirmed cases with more than 90% of the share of the
heatmap, where it is at around 80% concerning the fatality
impact. The remaining 10% of confirmed cases and 20% of
death cases are shared between Ebola 2014 and SARS 2003.
The results illustrate well the magnitude of the severity of
COVID-19 as compared to the other diseases.
At continent-level, Europe is the most affected with
COVID-19 with 51.64% of confirmed cases, then Asia with
23.92%, and the Americas with 19.02%. The impact of Ebola
on Africa is only 2.46%, and the impact of SARS 2003 on
Asia is only 1.26 %.
At region-level, the Southern Europe region has 25.94% of
confirmed cases, followed by Western Europe Asia 19.8%,
then Northern America 17.19%, and Eastern Asia with 15%.
The impact of Ebola 2014 on Western Africa is valued to
2.46%, and the impact of SARS Eastern Asia is only 1.26%.
At the country-level, The USA has the most significant
share of confirmed cases (as of March 27, 2020) with
16.43%, followed by Italy 13.98%, then China 13.15%. We
can also observe that the number of confirmed cases of Ebola
2014 in Sierra Leon is similar to the COVID-19 spread in
South Korea and countries in the West of Europe, namely,
Netherlands, Belgium, and Austria.
Regarding the death cases’ impact, it is different from the
confirmed cases.
At continent-level, the highest death impact is in Europe
with 56.26%, then Asia with 18.56% with COVID-19, which
is of the same magnitude as the fatality of Ebola 2014 in
Africa.
Looking at Table II, we can observe a strong correlation
between the median age at a continent/region and the fatality
rate. Europe is the oldest of all continents, with a median age
of 42% has the highest fatality rates, mainly in Southern and
Western Europe.
At region-level, we observed that the deadly impact of
Ebola 2014 on Western Africa is the second most severe
after the deadly impact of death in the South of Europe.
At the country-level, the impact of COVID-19 is the
highest in Italy, followed by the impact of Ebola 2014 in
