Abstract
Mathematical models in epidemiology strive to describe the dynamics and important characteristics
of infectious diseases. Apart from their scientific merit, these models are often used to inform political
decisions and interventional measures during an ongoing outbreak. Since high-fidelity models are
often quite complex and analytically intractable, their applicability to real data depends on powerful
estimation algorithms. Moreover, uncertainty quantification in such models is far from trivial, and
different types of uncertainty are often confounded. With this work, we introduce a novel coupling
between epidemiological models and specialized neural network architectures. This coupling results
in a powerful Bayesian inference framework capable of principled uncertainty quantification and
efficient amortized inference once the networks have been trained on simulations from an arbitrarily
complex model. We illustrate the utility of our framework by applying it to real Covid-19 cases from
entire Germany and German federal states.

Introduction

Epidemiological models are indispensable to plan and evaluate infection prevention and control (IPC)
measures against infectious diseases. Moreover, epidemiological models can forecast the spread of a
pandemic under different assumptions and thus allow to estimate the demand for medical hospital
care and avoid potential shortages of medical equipment and capacities. In the case of communicable
1

diseases with immunity formation, these models typically take the form of systems of ordinary
differential equations governing the transitions between different population compartments, such
as, “Susceptible”, “Infected”, and “Recovered” (SIR) (see for example [1]). When various intrinsic
properties of the disease (e.g., transmission rates and recovery periods) are known, SIR models and
their extensions are successfully used to simulate outcomes of possible courses of action or non-action,
that is, they solve the so-called forward inference problem. However, for newly arising infectious
diseases such as Covid-19, these properties are initially unknown and must be estimated before
realistic simulations can be performed. The estimation of hidden model parameters from observations
of model outcomes is called inverse inference and constitutes a central task in many branches of
science.
The inverse problem is also referred to as model calibration in the medical decision and health
policy modeling literature [2]. The goal is to determine the values of the unknown model parameters
such that the model outputs match the observed real-world data, the so-called calibration targets,
as close as possible. Model calibration can be considered as an optimization problem seeking the
best possible parameter configuration (e.g., by performing non-linear least squares minimization
[3]). When the model’s outputs can be interpreted in a probabilistic manner, various maximum
likelihood (ML) methods can also be applied. A disadvantage of most inference-as-optimization
and ML methods is that they focus on accurate point estimation instead of principled uncertainty
quantification. However, the latter is equally important when interpreting parameter values or making
predictions about future outcomes.
An alternative but computationally more expensive approach is Bayesian model calibration
using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to estimate the full posterior distribution of
parameters given priors and observed data [4]. When the likelihood function is intractable or unknown,
approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) can be used to approximate the posterior distribution
of parameters [5, 6]. In contrast to optimization and ML approaches, Bayesian methods provide
a principled way to quantify the epistemic uncertainty surrounding the inverse problem, because
they return full posterior distributions rather than point estimates. Indeed, Bayesian inference with
MCMC has been widely used in Covid-19 modeling studies [7, 8, 9]. Our approach aims to combine
the advantages of optimization-based and Bayesian methods.
In particular, with this work we explore whether neural networks can facilitate model-based
inverse inference in epidemiology. Our analysis on the basis of a novel neural network architecture
called BayesFlow [10] answers this question in the affirmative. In contrast to mainstream neural
network applications like image analysis, epidemiology poses two major challenges: (i) there are no
2

large training sets of annotated real-world data; and (ii) reliable uncertainty quantification of the
network outputs is mandatory for these outputs to be usable in subsequent scenario simulations.
Standard neural network architectures do not live up to these challenges.
We address these challenges in two ways: (i) We use networks that are specifically designed to
perform Bayesian uncertainty quantification on their outputs. (ii) We leverage the epidemiological
insight represented by SIR-type models by means of an alternative training procedure – simulationbased training. In our framework, a large number of plausible hypothetical scenarios – generated by a
simulation program – is processed by the neural network until it becomes an expert in the interpretation
of epidemiological observations. After completion of the training phase, the available real-world
observations are passed to the network, which then estimates full Bayesian posterior distributions for
the real-world parameters of interest. The ultimate goal of our approach is comparable to that of
traditional simulation-based Bayesian inference methods, such as ABC, but our method operates
much faster and generalizes to any real dataset within the scope of its training expertise [10].
During the initial outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, model-based inference was used to provide
rapid estimates of key epidemiological parameters, which otherwise can be difficult to estimate
directly from primary clinical tracing data. For instance, [11] incorporated domestic and international
travel from and to Wuhan city in the SEIR model and used reported cases outside of Wuhan to infer
the reproduction number R0 and epidemic doubling time. The reproduction number of COVID-19 has
been estimated using a similar approach in various settings [7][9]. In addition to estimating R0 , [12]
used an age-stratified SEIR model to infer age-specific mortality rates that corrected the biases due
to the preferential ascertainment of severe cases and delayed mortality in Hubei China and Northern
Italy. As another example, [13] estimated the reduction in the transmission rate by the implemented
control measures in Wuhan using a SEIR model, which was further used to project the number of
infections averted. Finally, [14] used a networked dynamic meta-population model to infer the fraction
of undocumented infections and critical epidemiological characteristics. Importantly, since these
SEIR-type models and extensions thereof are being used to forecast the dynamics of an epidemic with
regard to public interventions or seasonal effects, reliable inference of key epidemiological parameters
and trustworthy uncertainty quantification is paramount to support decision making.
We demonstrate the feasibility of our method by analyzing public Covid-19 data for Germany
as a whole (three time-series: detected number of infected, recovered and deceased cases) and the
German federal states individually (two time-series: detected number of infected and deceased cases).
Since its first appearance in Wuhan in Dec 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected more than 26
million people around the globe and caused more than 800,000 attributable deaths (up to 07 Sept
3

2020). Germany too was severely affected by the pandemic, as around 250,000 people have been
infected to date, from which almost 10,000 have been considered to have died as a consequence of
the infection [15].
Our neural network is trained using simulations from a customized compartment model variant
in combination with an observation model describing the differences between true and reported case
numbers and an intervention model describing the IPC measures imposed by German authorities
[16]. The full model has 34 unknown parameters in total and we express our prior knowledge about
plausible parameter ranges by specifying relatively wide prior distributions and considering previous
literature [16, 17].
After processing the reported data, our network estimates the joint posterior distribution of all
model parameters. We observe that the posteriors are considerably narrower than the priors, that is,
the network has gained a lot of additional information from the data. Credibility intervals of our
parameter estimates are well in line with independently published results, and re-simulations starting
at our estimated parameters fit the observed and future time-series very well. In particular, our
inference suggests that approximately four fifths of all infectious individuals are undetected across all
German federal states, which corresponds to the preliminary results of recent antibody studies and
has profound implications for suggested relaxations of IPC measures.

recovered and deceased) in Germany and the individual federal states from March 01, 2020 until
June 11, 2020. Data were obtained from publicly available sources. Code and scripts for reproducing

2.2

Neural Bayesian Parameter Estimation

The Bayesian perspective provides the mathematical tools and concepts for theoretically sound
uncertainty-aware parameter estimation [4]. It requires prior knowledge about the nature of the
forward process and reasonable parameter ranges as a starting point and combines it with information
extracted from observed data into a posterior distribution, which represents our updated state of

4

knowledge. More formally, let θ be the vector of all hidden parameters and X := x1:T = [x1 , ..., xT ] a
multivariate epidemiological time-series. Then the well-known analytical formula for the posterior
according to Bayes’ rule is
p(θ | X) = R

p(X | θ) p(θ)
p(X | θ) p(θ) dθ

(1)

where p(X | θ) represents the forward model written as the likelihood of observing data X when
the true parameters are θ, p(θ) is the prior distribution encoding our knowledge about plausible
parameter combinations, and the denominator is a normalizing constant (the evidence).
Although conceptually simple, this formula poses two major challenges in the present setting:
(i) Efficient and accurate approximation of the intractable posterior p(θ | X) is challenging. (ii) The
likelihood is only implicitly defined via samples x1:T ∼ p(X | θ) created by repeatedly running the
epidemiological simulation model. We solve both problems with our recently proposed neural Bayesian
inference architecture (see [10] for full details). Its core component is an invertible neural network
implemented as a normalizing flow. During the training phase, the invertible network is run in forward
mode to learn an accurate model q(θ | X) ≈ p(θ | X) for the posterior distribution of parameters
given any observation, using a large number of simulated pairs (Xi , θi ) ∼ p(X | θ) p(θ) as training
data. In the inference phase, the network operates in the inverse direction (which is easy thanks to
its invertible architecture) to estimate the posterior q(θ | X = xobs ) ≈ p(θ | X = xobs ) for the actually
observed data xobs . Moreover, the network can be applied to multiple real observations without
retraining, so that the training effort quickly amortizes over all inference queries (so called amortized
inference). In addition, fast inverse inference facilitates model validation by making probabilistic
calibration and posterior predictive checks on large validation datasets simple and very efficient [10].

2.3

The Epidemiological Model

In order to account for the specific nature of the current Covid-19 outbreak, our epidemiological
model consists of three submodels: (i) a disease model describing the true dynamics of relevant
population compartments; (ii) an intervention model describing the strengthening and relaxation
of non-pharmaceutical counter-measures; and (iii) an observation model describing the deviations
of published reports from the true values. These models build upon the previous work of [18, 16],
who adapted the general SIR approach to the specifics of the Covid-19 epidemic and the situation in
Germany. Parameter priors are based on our current state of knowledge about disease characteristics
and government measures, but are chosen very wide to prevent them from dominating the information
extracted from the actual observations.

implemented by our custom compartmental model. The graphic also illustrates external factors, such
as IPC measures and noise, which affect the daily reported number of cases.
Disease Model: The disease model is a system of non-linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
comprising six compartments: susceptible (S), exposed (E - infected individuals who do not show
symptoms and are not yet infectious), infected (I - symptomatic cases that are infectious), carrier (C
- infectious individuals who recover without being detected), recovered (R), and dead (D), see figure
1. Note that direct recovery from C covers all reasons why an infection might go undetected, that is,
truly asymptomatic cases, lack of follow-up on pre-symptomatic cases, limited testing capacity under
minor symptoms etc. are not differentiated by our model. Observations with limited accuracy (as
described by the observation model below) are available for the compartments I, R, and D. The true
time-series of all compartments are therefore considered latent and need to be estimated.

The meaning of the model parameters and their priors are detailed in Table 1. Prior ranges are based
on considerations in [16] and [17]. Note that the transmission rate λ(t) is a function of time, because
it is the parameter affected by non-pharmaceutical interventions. In principle, changes in testing
policy, medical advances, etc. could also cause other parameters to become time-dependent, but this
is not the case in the region and period considered in this paper.

Intervention Model: The intervention model controls the time-varying transmission rate λ(t).
Following [16], we define three change points encoding an assumed transmission rate reduction in
response to IPC measures imposed by the German authorities. Each change point is represented by a
piece-wise linear function with three degrees of freedom: the effect strength and the time interval for
the effect to fully manifest itself. Their priors express the expected effect of each measure to reduce
the transmission rate roughly by half after the date when it comes into force, but we leave very wide
uncertainty margins to facilitate learning of the actual behavior. In addition, our model includes a
fourth change point expressing the assumption that an eventual withdrawal of effective IPC measures
(officially or due to non-compliance) will lead to a slight increase of the transmission rate. Prior
7

distributions for all parameters are given in table Table 2. Note that we assume that interventions do
not affect the risk of infection upon contact with a detected infectious individual (β).
Observation Model: The observation model represents the deviations between officially reported
case counts and their true values. It comprises three error sources: the reporting delay, the weekly
modulation (since testing and reporting activities are considerably reduced on weekends), and a
noise term describing random fluctuations. Separate parameter sets are learned for each of the three
publicly available time-series I (obs) , R(obs) , and D(obs) – the remaining compartments are considered
unobservable. The relationship between the reported counts and their true values is described by the
following set of discrete-time difference equations with time steps t measured in days. Note that the
observed quantities only depend on the detectable symptomatic fraction of the infected population:

The weekly modulation scalar fC for each of the compartments C ∈ {I, R, D} is computed as follows:

The BayesFlow Network for Epidemiological Inference

Or neural architecture comprises three subnetworks: (i) a convolutional filtering network performing
noise reduction and feature extraction on the raw observational data; (ii) a recurrent summary
network reducing preprocessed time-series of varying length to statistical summaries of fixed size;
(iii) an invertible inference network performing Bayesian parameter inference, given the summary
statistics of the observations. Figure 2 depicts the architecture of this composite network.
The design of the convolutional network is inspired by that of the Inception network which has
shown tremendous success in computer vision tasks [19]. In particular, our network is implemented

as a deep fully convolutional network which applies adjustable one-dimensional filters of different
size at each level (cf. Figure 2). The intuition behind this design is that filters of different size might
capture patterns at different temporal scales (e.g., a filter of size one will capture daily fluctuations
whereas a filter of size seven will capture weekly dynamics). This, in turn, should ease the task of
extracting informative temporal features for parameter estimation.
The output of the convolutional network is a multivariate sequence containing the filtered
epidemiological time-series. In order to reduce the filtered sequence to a fixed-size vector, we pass
it through a long-short term memory (LSTM) recurrent network. Importantly, the LSTM network
can deal with sequences of varying length, which enables online learning (i.e., Bayesian updating
when new epidemiological data becomes available) and makes the same inference network applicable
to settings with different data availability. Compared to a fixed pooling operation (e.g., mean or
max), our recurrent network performs a learnable pooling operation which respects the sequential
probabilistic symmetry of the data. In this way, our inference architecture learns to filter and extract
the most informative features from the noisy observations in an end-to-end manner, such that no
manual and potentially suboptimal selection of hand-crafted data features is required from the user.
Finally, the inference network has the task of inverting the forward model given the information
extracted by the convolutional and recurrent networks. The inference network is implemented as a
deep invertible conditional coupling flow [20] (see also [10] for more details on the design of conditional
coupling flows for inference). The invertible network has two modes of operation.
During training, it is only evaluated in the forward direction and encouraged via a suitable
optimization criterion to transform the posterior into a simple base distribution (e.g., Gaussian) from
which samples can be easily obtained. Thus, the inference network integrates information both from
the prior and from the data-generating mechanism (i.e., the implicit likelihood).
During inference, the inference network is only evaluated in the inverse direction using conditional
information from real observed data passed through the filtering and summary networks. The posterior
is approximated by repeatedly sampling from the simple base distribution and applying the inverse
of the forward transformation learned during the training phase. Importantly, this method recovers

10

the true posterior under perfect convergence of the optimization method [10].
More formally, let us denote the functions represented by the three networks as a, b, and c. Then
the filtering network determines a filtered time series x
e1:T = a(x1:T ) from observed data x1:T , where
the number of time steps T may vary according to data availability. The summary network turns
the output of the filtering network into fixed-size vectors y = b(e
x1:T ). Finally, the inference network
generates samples θb ∼ q(θ | x1:T ) from the parameter posterior by computing θb = c−1 (y, z) with
normally distributed random vectors z ∼ N (0, I). The parameters of all three networks are optimized
jointly during the training phase. Denoting the vector of all trainable network parameters as φ, the
three networks solve the following optimization criterion

φb = argmin EX∼p(X) KL(p(θ | X) || qφ (θ | X))

We approximate the latter expectation via its empirical mean over samples X, θ ∼ p(θ, X) obtained
via simulations from the forward model (see section 2.3).
As previously mentioned, one of the most important advantages of our method is amortized
inference, owing to the fact that we approximate the posterior globally via a single set of network

is applied in multiple populations (countries, cultures) or at different scales (states, regions), since
the same pre-trained model can be repeatedly utilized for different populations and scales. Indeed,
in the following real-world application, we demonstrate efficient amortized inference and excellent
predictive performance with a single architecture applied simultaneously to epidemiological data
from all German federal states.

2.5

Outbreak Prediction on the Basis of Estimated Posteriors

In a Bayesian context, posterior predictions can be derived from parameter estimates either for the
purpose of model checking or for actual forecasts about future outcomes. Given observed timeseries
X := x1:t , the posterior predictive distribution for upcoming data X 0 := xt+1:T is given by:
0

p(X | X) =

Z

p(X 0 | θ, X) p(θ | X) dθ

(14)

This quantity is hard to compute, since it requires integration over the posterior. Moreover, it requires
a numerical evaluation of the likelihood p(X 0 | θ, X), which in our case is not available in closed form.
11

However, as mentioned previously, we approximate the posterior via samples {θ(l) ∼ p(θ | X)}L
l=1 .
Note that the θ(l) are drawn from the joint posterior, so that statistical dependencies and correlations
between parameters are properly taken into account. Since we also have access to the simulator, we
can obtain predictions by running the simulator with each posterior sample to obtain L simulated
e (l) }L . We can then use these timeseries to obtain point predictions (e.g., by computing
time-series {X
l=1
the mean or median for each time point), or quantify uncertainty (e.g., by computing quantiles
or standard deviation for each time point). In this way, we are not only able to perform posterior
checking about how the model reproduces the observations it was fitted to, but also to predict how
an outbreak will unfold over a future time frame.

Results

3.1

Entire Germany

Marginal parameter posteriors and predictions for Germany as a whole are depicted in Figure 3.
Standard point estimates (median, mean, MAP mode) and credibility intervals (95%-CI between the
2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the corresponding posterior) for all 34 model parameters are given in
Table 4. When interpreting these results, one should keep in mind that our model (and SIR-type
models in general) only describes the combined behavior of entire compartments. Accordingly, the
given CIs quantify our uncertainty about the inferred parameter estimates and cannot serve as a
measure of the variability between individual cases.
Utilizing the estimated joint posterior, our model yields good predictions, and its forecasts have
well-calibrated uncertainty bounds for both cumulative and newly infected, recovered, and diseased
cases (see Figure 3a resp. Figure 3b and the simulation-based calibration checks in Figure S1). Second,
our parameter estimates (cf. Figure 3c) are convergent with previous findings about central disease
parameters [16]. Perhaps the most interesting result regards the undetected diseased cases. The
median probability of remaining undetected (parameter α) lies at 0.63 and the maximum a posteriori
(MAP) estimate at 0.79 (95%-CI [0.07 − 0.91]). Notwithstanding the large uncertainty surrounding
the number of undetected cases, the posterior of α is clearly far from uniform (our prior assumption),
and peaks well beyond 0.5 (see Figure 3c). This estimate is largely consistent with recent reports
[21, 22, 23]. Together with the case fatality rate (parameter δ) of 4.1% (median) resp. 3% (MAP),
this results in an infection fatality rate of about 0.63% (MAP estimates) or 1.5% (median estimates).
Additionally, our model estimates a rather long period where individuals are infectious without

12

knowing: 3.23 days will typically pass before the disease gets diagnosed (95%-CI [1.92−5.55], parameter
1/η). This is in line with results from [24] (around 4 days) and the World Health Organization [25]
(5 − 6 days). Similarly, recovery takes a median number of 4.59 days (95%-CI [2.99 − 11.11], parameter
1/θ) when the disease remains undiagnosed throughout (asymptomatic, weakly symptomatic etc.).
In connection with parameter β, which asserts that the transmission rate of manifestly ill patients
is only 26% as big as that of silent carriers (95%-CI [14% − 45%]), this confirms the observation
that presymptomatic and undiagnosed individuals are responsible for a considerable fraction of the
infections. The low value for β also indicates that isolation after diagnosis appears to work effectively
and possibly that infectiousness gradually decreases over time. When we assume that most infections
occur near the end of the carrier stage, that is, after about 3 days in compartment C, and combine
this with the latent period (i.e., the time in compartment E: median 6.67 days, 95%-CI [3.33 − 11.1],
parameter 1/γ), we arrive at a serial interval of around 9 − 10 days. However, these interpretations
should be considered tentative.
After diagnosis, the median recovery period is estimated at 8.06 days (95%-CI [6.13 − 10.20],
parameter 1/µ). Thus, manifestly ill cases typically require 11.3 = 1/η + 1/µ = 3.23 + 8.06 days until
recovery and have a more severe disease progression than undiagnosed individuals with 1/θ = 4.6
days to recovery, cf. [26]. On the other hand, the time between diagnosis and death (6.67 days,
95%-CI [3.12 − 14.3], parameter 1/d) is shorter than in clinical reports. However, this deviation
can be explained by looking at the estimated reporting delay for compartment D of 11.3 days
(parameter DD ), which is probably much longer than in reality. This is an example of a parameter
combination that potentially remains unidentifiable: from the available time series alone, the model
cannot distinguish a long critical phase with short reporting delay from rapid death with long
reporting delay. Nevertheless, it is remarkable how much information about 34 free parameters our
networks can extract from seeing only about 70 time steps of real data.
Finally, our results corroborate the timing of IPC measures and the gradual reduction in transmission rate observed in [16]. Furthermore, according to our estimates, the lifting of measures around
May 6 would have led to approximately 40% increase in the transmission rate, as assumed by our prior.
However, since the spreading rate at t4 is already down to a median of 0.09 (95%-CI: [0.05 − 0.15]),
the increase to a median of 0.13 (95%-CI [0.05 − 0.28]) does not lead to an exponential growth of
infections.

Figure 4: Model predictions of cumulative Covid-19 cases for each German federal state. Cases to the
left of the vertical dashed line (8 weeks) were used for model fitting and posterior checking and cases
to the right (3 weeks) for forecasts on new data. We observe that median model predictions closely
match both past and future reported cases for each German federal state. Most importantly, the
reported cases always lie within the estimated CIs, which vary across the federal states.

3.2

German Federal States

In the previous subsection, we demonstrated excellent model-based predictions and discussed parameter estimates obtained from epidemiological data from entire Germany. Here, we simulate
epidemiological data from our custom model with varying population size N and train a BayesFlow
network which we apply to epidemiological data from each German federal state. Training the network
took approximately one day on a single GPU-machine, whereas obtaining posterior samples given
data from all 16 states was nearly instant.
First, posterior predictions and forecasts for cumulative infections in each federal state are depicted
in Figure 4 (see Figure S3 for predictions of cumulative deaths and Figure S2 for simulation-based
probabilistic calibration of the approximate posteriors). Again, we observe that median predictions
follow very closely the reported cumulative number of cases across all federal states. Furthermore,
the reported cases are very well represented by the uncertainty bounds derived from the parameter
posteriors, with prediction uncertainty growing as we move towards the future (cf. predictions after
the dotted vertical lines in Figure 4). However, median predictions of cumulative deaths can become

unreliable when only few cases are available (see predictions for the state Mecklenburg-Western
Pomerania Figure S3), so well-calibrated uncertainty estimates are particularly important and need
to be taken into account in addition to point predictions.
Second, full parameter posteriors recovered for each of the German federal states are depicted
in the Appendix. Here, we will briefly focus on similarities/differences in four interesting latent
parameters: probability of remaining undetected (α), recovery rate of undetected (θ), number of
initially exposed individuals (E0 ), and initial transmission rate (λ0 ).
Posterior estimates of the parameters α and θ are depicted in Figure 5c and Figure 5d. First, we
observe that posteriors of α across states tend to peak well above 0.5, suggesting that larger numbers
of individuals have remained undetected/undiagnosed throughout the initial months of the Covid-19
pandemic in Germany. Interestingly, the marginal posteriors of each α obtained from different states
appear pronouncedly sharper than the posterior of α obtained for entire Germany (see Appendix
for full marginal posterior plots from each state). Although the sharpness of the α-posteriors might
be an estimation artifact, it might also be due to the fact that a simpler model was used for the state
data (i.e., modeling only two epidemiological time series, new infections and deaths, instead of three).

17

Further, there is a smaller probability to remain undiagnosed in the states of Bavaria, Berlin,
and North Rhine-Westphalia than in other states. There are also some noticeable differences in the
uncertainty surrounding α (compare for instance Brandenburg vs. Berlin). Second, there appears to
be less interstate variability in the estimates of θ, suggesting an overall fast recovery of undiagnosed
individuals.
In contrast, some interstate differences in the estimates of initially exposed individuals (E0 )
are evident (cf. Figure 5a), with the states of Bavaria, Berlin, and North Rhine-Westphalia having
pronouncedly more initially exposed individuals at onset than other states. Finally, Figure 5b depicts
an interstate comparison between initial transmission rates. We observe that estimates vary between
a median value of 2.27 across states, with the state Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania having the
lowest and the state Baden-Württemberg having the highest median transmission rate at onset.

Discussion

In this work, we presented a novel simulation-based Bayesian inference framework for complex
epidemiological models. We directly demonstrated the utility of our method by applying it to publicly
available data on reported infected, recovered, and deceased individuals in Germany. We discussed
how substantive conclusions and forecasts can be derived from parameter posteriors and also how
to easily validate the resulting posteriors. We also used our posterior estimates to estimate two
crucial parameters related to the undetected fraction of infected individuals: the probability of being
diagnosed with the disease and the number of days undiagnosed individuals remain infectious.
Our estimates suggest that a considerable number of individuals might have gone undetected
through the course of the Covid-19 outbreak in Germany, confirming previous studies [21, 22, 23].
Further, our posteriors suggest that there is considerable uncertainty surrounding this estimate
when derived in a purely model-based manner. Moreover, different summary statistics (e.g., means,
medians, MAPs) derived from non-symmetric posteriors offer slightly different conclusions, thus
highlighting the need to consider the full posteriors and corresponding credibility intervals.
Our neural Bayesian inference architecture enables efficient simulation-based inference for key
epidemiological parameters using any mathematical model able to simulate the spread of an epidemic.
With standard SIR-type of models based on (stochastic) ordinary differential equations generally
providing a coarse-grained view on the epidemic dynamics [1], more complex models accounting for
heterogeneous social interactions, age-dependent effects, and/or spatial and temporal heterogeneity
[27, 28, 29, 30] become more important to predict the progression of an epidemic or guide IPC

18

measures [30, 16, 31]. Furthermore, given the general uncertainty in reported numbers for emerging
infectious diseases, estimation methods also need to account for this uncertainty when providing
parameter estimates and be able to efficiently incorporate incoming data.
We argue that our BayesFlow architecture for epidemiological data provides a general inference
framework for complex epidemiological scenarios. For example, it allows to introduce more or different
compartments, split compartments into strata (e.g., age groups) and add mobility information.
Especially the latter would likely improve our estimates of λ at the onset of the epidemic, since many
cases in Germany acquired the disease abroad. Unfortunately, the required data are very hard to
come by, so we refrained from implementing this possibility in the present paper.
Moreover, our approach has two key advantages over standard Bayesian methods. First, it can
flexibly deal with arbitrarily complex models and data structures, requiring no closed-form likelihoods
or ad hoc distributional restrictions regarding the shape of the joint prior or posterior. Second, the
amortized inference property allows efficient posterior sampling, simultaneous application to multiple
data sets as well as efficient online-learning and validation, once the networks have been trained with
sufficient amounts of simulated data.
These advantages are important, since they enable researchers to concentrate on formulating,
testing, and validating high-fidelity models without worrying about estimation efficiency or analytical
tractability. We therefore believe that our proposed architecture can facilitate uncertainty-aware
inference with complex and realistic epidemiological models, potentially revealing crucial dynamic
aspects of a spreading disease and informing IPC measures. Future developments include Bayesian
model comparison, multilevel modeling with hierarchical priors and a systematic comparison between
different neural inference architectures.

number of deaths in the state Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania over time is underestimated (although
it lies mostly within the estimated 95%-CI), which is probably due to the very low counts (lowest
among all German federal states).
