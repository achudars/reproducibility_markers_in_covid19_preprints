This study provides a phenomenological method to describe the exponential growth, saturation
and decay of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths and infections via a Monte Carlo approach. The calculations connect Gompertz-type trial distributions of infected people per day with
the distribution of deaths adopting two gamma distributions to account for the elapsed time that
encompass the incubation and symptom onset to death periods. The analyses include death’s data
from United States of America (USA), Brazil, Mexico, United Kingdom (UK), India and Russia,
which comprise the four countries with the highest number of deaths and the four countries with the
highest number of confirmed cases, as of Aug 07, 2020, according to the World Health Organization
webpage: https://covid19.who.int/table. The Gompertz functions were fitted to the data of
weekly averaged confirmed deaths per day by mapping the χ2 values. The uncertainties, variances
and covariances of the model parameters were calculated by propagation, taking into account the
standard deviations of the data for each epidemiological week. The fitted functions for the average
deaths per day for USA and India have an upward trend, with the former having a higher growth
rate and quite huge uncertainties. For Mexico, UK and Russia, the fits are consistent with a slope
down pattern. For Brazil we found a subtle trend down, but with significant uncertainties. The
USA, UK and India data shown a first peak with a higher growth rate when compared to the
second one (typically 2.7 to 3.7 times higher), demonstrating the benefits of non-pharmaceutical
interventions of sanitary measures and social distance flattening the curves of the pandemic. For
the case of USA, however, a third peak seems quite plausible, most likely related with the recent
relaxation policies. Brazil’s data are satisfactorily described by two highly overlapped Gompertz
functions with similar growth rates, suggesting a two-steps process for the pandemic spreading. For
the case of Mexico and Russia single peaks with smoother slopes fitted the data satisfactorily. The
95% confidence intervals for the total number of deaths (×103 ) predicted by the model for Aug
31, 2020 are 160 to 220, 110 to 130, 59 to 62, 46.6 to 47.3, 54 to 63 and 16.0 to 16.7 for USA,
Brazil, Mexico, UK, India and Russia, respectively. Our estimates for the prevalences of infections
are in reasonable agreement with some preliminary reports from serological studies carried out in
USA and Brazil. The prevalences and 95% confidence intervals for Aug 1, 2020 were estimated
to be 8.3(5.7-10.9)%, 7.9(6.6-9.2)%, 6.7(6.0-7.5)%, 10.5(8.4-12.6)%, 0.6(0.5-0.7)% and 1.6(1.5-1.8)%
for USA, Brazil, Mexico, UK, India and Russia, respectively. The method represents an effective
framework to estimate the line-shape of the infection curves and the uncertainties of the relevant
parameters based on the actual data, in contrast with more complex epidemiological models that
require a comprehensive knowledge of several parameters.

The outbreak of the new coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) brought a challenging scenario worldwide
[1–3], urging timely and effective responses from the
authorities regarding the availability of intensive care
units [4, 5], as well as the implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions of social distance and protective sanitary measures [6–8]. Epidemiological models
[9–18] and other statistical approaches [19–21] have been
very useful to guide actions to manage this crisis and to
shed light on how to safely and gradually resume economics and social activities [22]. On the other hand,
quantitative analyses are strongly susceptible to several
uncertainties, such as under-reporting of confirmed cases
and deaths [23–25], lack of massive tests in some countries [26], changes in policies and methods for reporting
confirmed cases and deaths as time evolves during the

pandemic growth, very distinct socio-economic patterns
and health facilities capabilities among different countries
and also among different focuses of the disease within
the same country. Such complex and puzzling scenario
directly influences the forecast capabilities of the calculations, supporting the need of a multidisciplinary cooperation of the scientific community and the development
of mathematical models to provide plausible estimates
for the uncertainties of the relevant parameters [27–30].
Therefore, the present analysis provides an effective phenomenological method to estimate the magnitude and the
relevant uncertainties of some important quantities as the
pandemic evolves, such as: (1) the peak day(s), growth
rate(s) and total number of infected people for the reconstructed infection curves, (2) forecast distribution of
deaths per day, and (3) forecast total number of deaths
until Aug 31, 2020. It is worth mentioning, however, that
the predictions of the model strongly depend on the prevailing conditions already in place for the specific country
which data were analyzed, as any substantial change in

2
governmental policies, either in the direction of loosening or tightening social distance, will generate different
dynamics for the spread of the virus.
The best-fit parameters are generally strongly correlated,
but its uncertainties reflect the dispersion of the data at
each epidemiological week, making the present analysis
a suitable quantitative method to describe the pandemic
line-shape behavior with few parameters. Moreover, such
approach could also be useful for the identification of upward trends and its correlations with relaxation policies
and procedures as global social and economics activities
are gradually resumed [31].
The calculations assume that the total number of infected
people increase according with a Gompertz-type function, which is a sigmoid curve with a lower growth rate
at the beginning and at the end, such that:
−λ(t−t0 )

I(t) = N e−e

,

(1)

where N represents the asymptotic number of infected
people for t → ∞, λ is the growth rate and t0 the peak
time of the derivative of I(t). In such model, the number
of infected people per time period can be written as:
G(t) =

−λ(t−t0 )
d
I(t) = N λe−e
e−λ(t−t0 ) .
dt

(2)

For the specific case of COVID-19, the data of confirmed cases depend very strongly on testing and reporting policies for the related country. These policies may
also vary along time, distorting the shape of the distributions. This complicated scenario disfavor the use of confirmed cases as a reliable source of information to describe
the pandemic dynamics, which is crucial to guide government actions and decisions. In order to overcome these
difficulties, we have adopted the data of deaths per day,
as they should be more consistent with the actual spreading mechanism of the virus. The connection between the
trial function of the number of infected people per day
and the number of deaths per day takes into account the
probability distribution function for the elapsed time between the infection and the death, which can be satisfactorily described by the sum of two time periods, namely,
the incubation period tinc , and the symptom onset to
death period ts−d . Both periods are generated in the
Monte Carlo algorithm assuming that they are independent and gamma distributed with an average of 5.1 and
17.8 days and coefficient of variation of 0.86 and 0.45, respectively, as proposed elsewhere [32] based on previous
studies of Wuhan data [6, 33][34]. So, the time of the
death td can be written as: td = tinf + tinc + ts−d , with
tinf representing the time of infection.
The analysis of the deaths data [35] were done considering the weekly averaged deaths per day and its corresponding standard deviation of the average for the respective epidemiological week, counted retrospectively
from the end date of Aug 7, 2020. The time counting
considered the day of the first confirmed case for each
country and the first epidemiological weeks were chosen

in such a way that all days of the week had at least one
death, meaning that the present calculations do consider
the early stages of the pandemic, including from 19 up
to 22 weeks depending on the country (see Table I). The
mean day of each epidemiological week was chosen with
a time bin of ± 3.5 days, and the mean of each day was
taken at the half of the day. The trial line-shapes of
the number of infected people per day were generated
considering a single Gompertz function for the case of
Mexico and Russia, a sum of two Gompertz functions for
Brazil, United Kingdom, and India and three Gompertz
functions for USA. Such approach allows the inclusion
of two or more superimposed dynamics of the disease as
one would expect considering the changes in policies as
time evolves (which might remarkably reduce the growth
rates) and also the cluster structure expected for large
countries with multiple focuses of the disease (not observed for Mexico and Russia so far). Such method would
also allow the inclusion of other peaks as the countries
start their processes of re-opening social and economics
activities, which seems to be the case for USA.
The fitting procedure was performed by mapping the
χ2 , defined as:
χ2 =

n
X
[F̃iw − yiw ]2
,
2
σyiw
iw=1

(3)

where F̃iw is the trial function for deaths calculated at
time tiw (the mean day of the corresponding week), yiw
the weekly averaged deaths per day and σyiw its standard deviation. In that sense, the average values with
higher standard deviations had lower weights in the fitting procedure. The best fit parameters of the Gompertz functions (N, λ and t0 ) where obtained by sorting
5000 random sets of parameters around plausible guessing values and calculating the respective trial function
and χ2 for each candidate, assuming a total of 10 million infections using a time bin of one day. The trial
functions F̃iw were calculated for each set of parameters by the connection between the 10 million infection
events with the respective death events using the probability distribution function of tinc + ts−d , herein denoted
P rob(∆t) = P rob(td −tinf ) (see the insert of Fig.2). This
procedure was done several times with progressively narrow bins for each parameter’s increments until the respective χ2 converged to the minimal value (the convergence criteria required that the χ2 obtained for 5000 random sets of parameters is lower than the χ2 obtained for
4000 runs and their difference is lower than 0.05 units).
The calculation of the total number of infected people N
(three Gompertz functions for USA; two for Brazil, UK
and India and one for Mexico and Russia) was performed
assuming an infection-fatality-ratio (ifr ) of 0.66% [33]. A
least square method [36] was applied for the calculation
of the uncertainties of the best fit parameters, which covariance matrix can be written as:
V b = (F̃

′

⊤

′

V −1 F̃ )−1 ,

(4)

3
′

where F̃ = F̃iw,j stands for the partial derivative of F̃iw
at any tiw in respect to the Pj parameter of each Gompertz function (N, λ and t0 ). The variance matrix of the
2 −1
death’s data is diagonal, such that: Viw,iw = (σyiw
) .
Given the lower number of deaths per day for India
and Russia and the huge variation of the data in each
week, we have included an additional uncertainty of 5%
(σyiw → σyiw + 0.05yiw ) in order to achieve a success′
ful fitting. For the calculation of F̃iw,j we have used the
resulting convolution between the reconstructed curve of
infected people G(t) and the probability density function
P rob(∆t), such that:

(6)
where kmax = 1 for Mexico and Russia, 2 for Brazil, UK
and India and 3 for USA. The propagation of the uncertainties of the best fit parameters to the reconstructed
infection curve took into account the full co-variance ma′
trix V b, as similarly described in [37], with the vector Gm
being defined as:

for Mexico and Russia, 6 for Brazil, UK and India and 9
for USA). Consequently, the uncertainty of the infection
curve at each point can be written as:

σGm = G′m⊤ V bG′m .

The uncertainties in the convoluted functions can be calculated as:

where σG(τ ) is obtained by the interpolation of σGm .
Figure 1 shows the weekly averaged deaths per day distributions for all six countries (data points) and its respective convoluted functions Fc (t) (dashed-dotted gray
lines). The upper and lower estimates FC± (t) [95% Confidence Intervals(CI)] are presented by the red and blue
dashed-dotted lines, respectively. The total number of

where Nd (ti ) corresponds to the actual data of accumulated deaths until the day (ti ) for each country.
Table I summarizes all the results, including the model
predictions for the total number of deaths and its 95%
CI for Aug 31, 2020. The countries with well defined first
peaks (USA and UK) present the highest initial growth
rates (0.109 ± 0.012d−1 and 0.100 ± 0.017d−1) and uncertainties in the peak days of 1.0 and 2.2 days, respectively.
The second peaks in both cases have much lower growth
rates, demonstrating the flattening of the infection curve
due to non-pharmacological interventions of social distance and sanitary measures. Besides UK, which clearly
shows a well controlled scenario, Mexico and Russia also
have a trend down with modest uncertainties, which is
a consequence of the fitting being successfully performed
with a single Gompertz function. For the case of India,
the first Gompertz function has a quite small contribution (∼2%) in the total number of infections and the second curve dominates the distribution of deaths per day;
resulting in modest uncertainties. For the case of Brazil,
there are few data points to properly constraint the second Compertz function, which has a similar growth rate
compared with the first one. The large overlap between
the two functions leads to high correlation coefficients between N1 and λ1 (-0.989), N2 and λ2 (-0.972), λ1 and λ2 (0.841) and N1 and N2 (-0.973), influencing for the large
uncertainties. A similar situation also play a role for the
huge uncertainties found in the parameters of the third
Gompertz function for USA, which is weakly constrained
with few data points. The death’s peak days have an average shift of 22.9 days from the corresponding infection’s
peaks, which is the average of Prob(t ) (the sum of the
averages of the two gamma functions). The estimates
for the prevalences of infections at the beginning of each
month are also shown in Table I for all six countries.
For the case of USA, our estimated prevalence for April
3-4, 2020 [2.6% (95% CI, 2.1 to 3.0%)] is in good agreement with a preliminary serological study carried out in
Santa Clara County [38] 2.8% (95% CI, 1.3-4.7%). For
the case of Brazil, we found a prevalence of 2.6% (95% CI
2.3-2.9%) within May 15-22, 2020, which is higher than
the overall prevalence found in a survey that included
90 cities of Brazil 1.4% (95% CI, 1.3-1.6%)[39]. On the
other hand, our result for May 14, 2020 [(2.3%(95% CI,
2.1-2.6%)] is in good agreement with the figures reported
in a preliminary research performed in the Brazilian State
of Espirito Santo [40] 2.1% (95% CI, 1.67-2.52%). Obviously that these comparisons should be done with parsimony, given the fact that our results refer to an overall
estimate for each country and are strictly related with an
infection-fatality-ratio of 0.66% [33].
The upper panel of Figure 2 shows the model predictions for the accumulated number of infections (solid
lines) and the lower panel shows the corresponding
model estimates for the accumulated deaths, in comparison with the available data (data points) at each

4
5 day time interval. Once again it is verified a nice
agreement between the data and the model, with some
discrepancies found in the early stages of the pandemic
(accumulated number of deaths . 100). The Monte
Carlo generated probability distribution Prob(t ), and
the two gamma distributions (incubation and symptom
onset to deaths periods) are presented in the insert of
the lower panel of Figure 2.

In conclusion, we have presented a few-parameter
model to describe the dynamics of a pandemic in terms of
Gompertz functions using Monte Carlo techniques to determine the best fit parameters and a least square method
- weighted by the dispersion of the death’s data in each
epidemiological week - to estimate the relevant uncertainties.
