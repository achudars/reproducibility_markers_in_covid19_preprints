Received 24 April 2020

The COVID-19 pandemic is causing a major outbreak in more than 150 countries
around the world, having a severe impact on the health and life of many people globally. One of the crucial step in fighting COVID-19 is the ability to detect the infected
patients early enough, and put them under special care. Detecting this disease from
radiography and radiology images is perhaps one of the fastest ways to diagnose the
patients. Some of the early studies showed specific abnormalities in the chest radiograms of patients infected with COVID-19. Inspired by earlier works, we study the
application of deep learning models to detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We first prepare a dataset of 5,000 Chest X-rays from the publicly
available datasets. Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease presence were identified by
board-certified radiologist. Transfer learning on a subset of 2,000 radiograms was used
to train four popular convolutional neural networks, including ResNet18, ResNet50,
SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121, to identify COVID-19 disease in the analyzed chest
X-ray images. We evaluated these models on the remaining 3,000 images, and most
of these networks achieved a sensitivity rate of 98% (± 3%), while having a specificity
rate of around 90%. Besides sensitivity and specificity rates, we also present the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, precision-recall curve, average prediction,
and confusion matrix of each model. We also used a technique to generate heatmaps of
lung regions potentially infected by COVID-19 and show that the generated heatmaps
contain most of the infected areas annotated by our board certified radiologist. While
the achieved performance is very encouraging, further analysis is required on a larger set
of COVID-19 images, to have a more reliable estimation of accuracy rates. The dataset,
model implementations (in PyTorch), and evaluations, are all made publicly available
for research community at https://github.com/shervinmin/DeepCovid.git

Since December 2019, a novel corona-virus (SARS-CoV-2)
has spread from Wuhan to the whole China, and many other
countries. By April 18, more than 2 million confirmed cases,
and more than 150,000 deaths were reported in the world [1].

areas by our radiologist.

Due to unavailability of therapeutic treatment or vaccine for
novel COVID-19 disease, early diagnosis is of real importance
to provide the opportunity of immediate isolation of the suspected person and to decrease the chance of infection to healthy
population. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) or gene sequencing for respiratory or blood specimens are introduced as main screening methods for COVID-19
[2]. However, total positive rate of RT-PCR for throat swab
samples is reported to be 30 to 60 percent, which accordingly
yields to un-diagnosed patients, which may contagiously infect
a huge population of healthy people [3]. Chest radiography
imaging (e.g., X-ray or computed tomography (CT) imaging)
as a routine tool for pneumonia diagnosis is easy to perform
with fast diagnosis. Chest CT has a high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19 [4] and X-ray images show visual indexes
correlated with COVID-19 [5]. The reports of chest imaging
demonstrated multilobar involvement and peripheral airspace
opacities. The opacities most frequently reported are groundglass (57%) and mixed attenuation (29%) [6]. During the early
course of COVID-19, ground glass pattern is seen in areas that
edges the pulmonary vessels and may be difficult to appreciate
visually [7]. Asymmetric patchy or diffuse airspace opacities
are also reported for COVID-19 [8]. Such subtle abnormalities can only be interpreted by expert radiologists. Considering
huge rate of suspected people and limited number of trained radiologists, automatic methods for identification of such subtle
abnormalities can assist the diagnosis procedure and increase
the rate of early diagnosis with high accuracy. Artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning solutions are potentially powerful
tools for solving such problems.
So far, due to the lack of availability of public images of
COVID-19 patients, detailed studies reporting solutions for automatic detection of COVID-19 from X-ray (or Chest CT) images are not available. Recently a small dataset of COVID19 X-ray images was collected, which made it possible for AI
researchers to train machine learning models to perform automatic COVID-19 diagnostics from X-ray images [10]. These
images were extracted from academic publications reporting
the results on COVID-19 X-ray and CT images. With the help

of a board-certified radiologist, we re-labeled those images, and
only kept ones a clear sign of COVID-19 as determined by
our radiologist. Three sample images with their corresponding
marked areas are shown in Figure 1. We then used a subset of
images from ChexPert [11] dataset, as the negative samples for
COVID-19 detection. The combined dataset has around 5,000
Chest X-ray images (called COVID-Xray-5k), which is divided
into 2,000 training, and 3,000 testing samples.
A machine a learning framework was employed to predict
COVID-19 from Chest X-ray images. Unlike the classical approaches for medical image classification which follow a twostep procedure (hand-crafted feature extraction+recognition),
we use an end-to-end deep learning framework which directly
predicts the COVID-19 disease from raw images without any
need of feature extraction. Deep learning based models (and
more specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN)) have
been shown to outperform the classical AI approaches in most
of computer vision and and medical image analysis tasks in recent years, and have been used in a wide range of problems
from classification, segmentation, face recognition, to superresolution and image enhancement [12, 18, 19, 20, 21].
Here, we train 4 popular convolutional networks which have
achieved promising results in several tasks during recent years
(including ResNet18, ResNet50, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet161) on COVID-Xray-5k dataset, and analyze their performance for COVID-19 detection. Since so far there is a limited number of X-ray images publicly available for the COVID19 class, we cannot simply train these models from scratch.
Two strategies were adopted to address the COVID-19 image
scarcity issue in this work:
• We use data augmentation to create transformed version
of COVID-19 images (such as flipping, small rotation,
adding small amount of distortions), to increase the number of samples by a factor of 5.
• Instead of training these models from scratch, we fine-tune
the last layer of the pre-trained version of these models on
ImageNet. In this way, the model can be trained with less
labeled samples from each class.
The above two strategies helped train these networks with the
available images, and achieve reasonable performance on the
test set of 3,000 images. Since the number of samples for the
COVID-19 class is limited, we also calculate the confidence
interval of the performance metrics. To report a summarizing
performance of these models, we provide the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and area under the curve (AUC)
for each of these models.
Here are the main contributions of this paper:
• We prepared a dataset of 5,000 images with binary labels,
for COVID-19 detection from Chest X-ray images. This
dataset can serve as a benchmark for the research community. The images in COVID-19 class, are labeled by a
board-certified radiologist, and only those with a clear sign
are used for testing purpose.
• We trained four promising deep learning models on this
dataset, and evaluated their performance on a test set of

S Minaee, R Kafieh, M Sonka, S Yazdani, G.J. Soufi / Medical Image Analysis (2020)

3,000 images. Our best performing model achieved a sensitivity rate of 98%, while having a specificity of 92%.
• We provided a detailed experimental analysis on the performance of these models, in terms of sensitivity, specificity, ROC curve, area under the curve, precision-recall
curve, and histogram of the predicted scores.
• We provided the heatmaps of the most likely regions,
which are infected due to Covid-19, using a deep visualization technique.
• We made the dataset, the trained models, and the implementation publicly available.
It is worth to mention that while very encouraging, given the
amount of the labeled data the result of this work is still preliminary and more concrete conclusion requires further experiments
on a larger dataset of COVID-19 labeled X-ray images. We believe this work can serve as a benchmark for future works and
comparisons.
The structure of the rest of this paper is as follows. Section 2 provides a summary of the prepared COVID-Xray-5k
Dataset. Section 3 presents the description of the overall proposed framework. Section 4 provides the experimental studies
and comparison with previous works. And finally the paper is
concluded in Section 5.
2. COVID-Xray-5k Dataset
Chest X-ray images from two datasets formed the COVIDXray-5k dataset that contains 2,084 training and 3,100 test images.
One of the used datasets is the recently published CovidChestxray-Dataset, which contains a set of images from publications on COVID-19 topics, collected by Joseph Paul Cohen
[9, 10]. This dataset contains a mix of chest X-ray and CT
images. As of May 3, 2020, it contained 250 X-ray images
of COVID-19 patients, from which 203 images are anteriorposterior view. It is mentioned that this dataset is continuously
updated. It also contains some meta-data about each patients,
such as sex and age. Our COVID-19 images are all coming
from this dataset. Based on our board-certified radiologist advice, only anterior-posterior images are kept for Covid-19 prediction, as the lateral images are not suitable for this purpose.
The anterior-posterior images were examined by our boardcertified radiologist, and the ones without even the slightest radiographic signs of Covid-19 were removed from dataset. Out
of 203 interior-exterior X-ray images of COVID-19, 19 of them
were excluded, and 184 images (which showed clear signs of
COVID-19) were kept by our radiologist. This way, we can
provide the community a more cleanly labeled dataset. Out of
these images, we chose 100 COVID-19 images to include in the
test set (to meet some maximum confidence interval value), and
84 COVID-19 images for the training set. Data augmentation is
applied to the training set to increase the number of COVID-19
samples to 420 as described above. We made sure all images
for each patient go only to one of the training or test sets. It is

3

worth mentioning that our radiologist marked the regions with
specific signs of Covid-19.
Since the number of Non-Covid images was very small in the
[9] dataset, additional images were employed from the ChexPert dataset [11], a large public dataset for chest radiograph interpretation consisting of 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240
patients, labeled for the presence of 14 sub-categories (nofinding, Edema, Pneumonia, etc.). For the non-COVID samples in the training set, we only used images belonging to a single sub-category, composed of 700 images from the no-finding
class and 100 images from each remaining 13 sub-classes, resulting in 2,000 non-COVID images.
As for the Non-COVID samples in the test dataset, we selected 1,700 images from the no-finding category and around
100 images from each remaining 13 sub-classes in distinct subfolders, resulting in 3000 images in total. The exact number
of images of each class for both training and testing is given in
Table 1.

Figure 2 shows 16 sample images from COVID-Xray-5k
dataset, including 4 COVID-19 images (the first row), 4 normal images from ChexPert (the second row), and 8 images with
one of the 13 diseases in ChexPert (third and fourth rows).

sample images of no-finding category in Non-COVID images from ChexPert. The images in the third and fourth rows give 8 sample images from
other sub-categotries in ChexPert.

It is worth mentioning that, there is wide variation inn the resolution of images in this dataset. There are some low-resolution
images in Covid-19 class (below 400x400), and some high resolutions ones (more than 1900x1400). This is a positive point

S Minaee, R Kafieh, M Sonka, S Yazdani, G.J. Soufi / Medical Image Analysis (2020)

To overcome the limited data sizes, transfer learning was
used to fine-tune four popular pre-trained deep neural networks
on the training images of COVID-Xray-5k dataset.
3.1. Transfer Learning Approach
In transfer learning, a model trained on one task is repurposed to another related task, usually by some adaptation toward the new task. For example, one can imagine using an image classification model trained on ImageNet (which contains
millions of labeled images) to initiate task-specific learning for
COVID-19 detection on a smaller dataset. Transfer learning is
mainly useful for tasks where enough training samples are not
available to train a model from scratch, such as medical image
classification for rare or emerging diseases. This is especially
the case for models based on deep neural networks, which have
a large number of parameters to train. By using transfer learning, the model parameters start with already-good initial values
that only need some small modifications to be better curated
toward the new task.
There are two main ways in which the pre-trained model is
used for a different task. In one approach, the pre-trained model
is treated as a feature extractor (i.e., the internal weights of the
pre-trained model are not adapted to the new task), and a classifier is trained on top of it to perform classification. In another
approach, the whole network, or a subset thereof, is fine-tuned
on the new task. Therefore the pre-trained model weights are
treated as the initial values for the new task, and are updated
during the training stage.
In our case, since the number of images in the COVID-19 category is very limited, we only fine-tune the last layer of the convolutional neural networks, and essentially use the pre-trained
models as a feature extractor. We evaluate the performance
of four popular pre-trained models, ResNet18 [14], ResNet50
[14], SqueezeNet [15], and DenseNet-121 [16]. In the next section we provide a quick overview of the architecture of these
models, and how they are used for COVID-19 recognition.
3.2. COVID-19 Detection Using Residual ConvNet – ResNet18
and ResNet50
One of the models used in this work, is the pre-trained
ResNet18, trained on ImageNet dataset. ResNet is one of the

3. The Proposed Framework

most popular CNN architecture, which provides easier gradient
flow for more efficient training, and was the winner of the 2015
ImageNet competition. The core idea of ResNet is introducing
a so-called identity shortcut connection that skips one or more
layers. This would help the network to provide a direct path to
the very early layers in the network, making the gradient updates for those layers much easier.
The overall block diagram of ResNet18 model, and how
it is used for COVID-19 detection is illustrated in Figure 3.
ResNet50 architecture is pretty similar to ResNet18, the main
difference being having more layers.

for the models that can achieve a reasonable high accuracy on
this dataset, despite this variable image resolution and imagery
methodology. Collecting all images in a super-controlled environment that results in high-resolution and super-clean images,
although desired, is not always doable, and as machine learning
field progresses, more and more focus is directed toward models and frameworks that can work reasonably well on variable
resolution, quality, and small-scale labeled datasets. Also the
images of Covid-19 class are collected from multiple sources
by the original provider, and some of them may show a different dynamic range from other ones (and also from ChexPert),
but during the training all images are normalized to the same
distribution to make model less sensitive to that.

3.3. COVID-19 Detection Using SqueezeNet
SqueezeNet [15] proposed by Iandola et al., is a small CNN
architecture, which achieves AlexNet-level [13] accuracy on
ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters. Using model compression techniques, the authors were able to compress SqueezeNet
to less than 0.5MB, which made it very popular for applications that require light-weight models. They alternate a 1x1
layer that ”squeezes” the incoming data in the vertical dimension followed by two parallel 1x1 and 3x3 convolutional layers
that ”expand” the depth of the data again. Three main strategies used in SqueezeNet includes: replace 3x3 filters with 1x1
filters, decrease the number of input channels to 3x3 filters,
Down-sample late in the network so that convolution layers
have large activation maps. Figure 4 shows the architecture of
a simple SqueezeNet.

3.4. COVID-19 Detection Using DenseNet
Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet) is another popular
architecture [16], which was the winner of the 2017 ImageNet
competition. In DenseNet, each layer obtains additional inputs
from all preceding layers and passes on its own feature-maps
to all subsequent layers. Each layer is receiving a collective
knowledge from all preceding layers. Since each layer receives
feature maps from all preceding layers, network can be thinner
and compact, i.e., number of channels can be fewer (so, it have
higher computational efficiency and memory efficiency). The
architecture of sample DenseNet is shown in Figure 5.

4.2. Evaluation Metrics
There are different metrics which can be used for evaluating
the performance of classification models, such as classification
accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score. Since
the current test dataset is highly imbalanced (100 COVID-19
images, 3000 Non-COVID image), sensitivity and specificity
are two proper metrics which can be used for reporting the
model performance:
#Images correctly predicted as COVID-19
,
#Total COVID-19 Images
#Images correctly predicted as Non-COVID
Specificity =
.
#Total Non-COVID Images

3.5. Model Training
All employed models are trained with a cross-entropy loss
function, which tries to minimize the distance between the predicted probability scores, and the ground truth probabilities (derived from labels), and is defined as:
LCE = −

N
X

pi log qi ,

(1)

i=1

where pi and qi denote the ground-truth, and predicted probabilities for each image, respectively. We can then minimize this
loss function using stochastic gradient descent algorithm (and
its variations). We attempted to add regularization to the loss
function, but the resulting model was not exhibiting a better
performance.
4. Experimental Results
4.1. Model Hyper-parameters
We fine-tuned each model for 100 epochs. The batch
size is set to 20, and ADAM optimizer is used to optimize the loss function, with a learning rate of 0.0001. All
images are down-sampled to 224x224 before being fed to
the neural network (as these pre-trained models are usually
trained with a specific image resolution). All our implementations are done in PyTorch [22], and are publicly available at
https://github.com/shervinmin/DeepCovid.git

As mentioned earlier, we focused on four popular convolutional networks, ResNet18, ResNet50, SqueezeNet,
DenseNet121. These models predict a probability score for
each image, which shows the likelihood of the image being detected as COVID-19. By comparing this probability with a cutoff threshold, we can derive a binary label showing if the image
is COVID-19 or not. An ideal model should predict the probability of all COVID-19 samples close to 1, and non-COVID
samples close to 0.
Figures 6, 7, 8, and 9 show the distribution of predicted
probability scores for the images in the test set, by ResNet18,
ResNet50, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-161 respectively. Since
Non-COVID class in our study contains both normal cases,
as well as other types of diseases, we provide the distribution of predicted scores for three classes: COVID-19, NonCOVID normal, and Non-COVID other diseases. As we can
see the Non-Covid images with other disease types have slightly
larger scores than the Non-COVID normal cases. This makes
sense, since those images are more difficult to distinguish from
COVID-19, than normal samples.
COVID-19 patient images are predicted to have much higher
probabilities than the Non-COVID images, which is really encouraging, as it shows the model is learning to discriminate
COVID-19 from non-COVID images. Among different models, it can be observed that SqueezeNet does a much better job
in pushing the predicted scores for COVID-19 and Non-COVID
images farther apart from each other.
4.4. Model Sensitivity and Specificity
Each model predicts a probability score showing the chance
of the image being COVID-19. We can then compare these
scores with a threshold to infer if the image is COVID-19 or
not. The predicted labels are used to estimate the sensitivity
and specificity of each model. Depending on the value of the
cut-off threshold, we can get different sensitivity and specificity
rates for each model.
Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5 show the sensitivity and specificity rates for different thresholds, using ResNet18, ResNet50,
SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121 models, respectively. As we
can see, all these models achieve very promising results, and
the best performing model obtains a sensitivity rate of 98% and

slightly better performance than the other models.

4.5. Small Number of COVID-19 Cases and Model Reliability
It is worth mentioning that since so far the number of reliably labeled COVID-19 X-ray images is very limited, and we
only have 100 test images in COVID-19 class, the sensitivity
and specificity rates reported above may not be reliable. Ideally more experiments on a larger number of test samples with
COVID-19 is needed to derive a more reliable estimation of
sensitivity rates. We can however estimate the 95% confidence

interval of the reported sensitivity and specificity rates here, to
see what is the possible range of these values for the current
number of test samples in each class. The confidence interval
of the accuracy rates can be calculated as:
r
accuracy (1 − accuracy)
(3)
r=z
,
N
where z denotes the significance level of the confidence interval (the number of standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution), accuracy is the estimated accuracy (in our cases sensitivity and specificity), and N denotes the number of samples for
that class. Here we used 95% confidence interval, for which the
corresponding value of z is 1.96.
As for COVID-19 diagnostic, having a sensitive model is crucial, we choose the cut-off threshold corresponding to a sensitivity rate of 98% for each model, and compare their specificity
rates. Table 6 provides a comparison of the performance of
these four models on the test set. As we can see the confidence
interval of specificity rates are small (around 1%), since we
have around 3000 samples for this class, whereas for the sensitivity rate we get slightly higher confidence interval (around
2.7%) because of the limited number of samples.

4.6. The ROC Curve, Precision Recall Curve, and Confusion
Matrix
It is hard to compare different models only based on their sensitivity and specificity rates, since these rates change by varying
the cut-off thresholds. To see the overall comparison between
these models, we need to look at the comparison for all possible
threshold values. One way to do this, is through the precisionrecall curve, which provides the precision rate as a function of
recall rate. Precision is defined as the true positive images divided by the total number of images flagged as positive by the
model, and the recall is the same as sensitivity rate (defined
in Eq (2)). The precision-recall curve of these four models is
shown in Figure 10.

worth mentioning that for highly imbalanced test sets, the AUC
may not be a good indicative of model performance (as it can
be very high), and looking at average-precision and precisionrecall curve would be a better choice in that case. Here we
provided both curves for the sake of completeness.

To see the exact number of correctly samples as COVID19 and Non-COVID, the confusion matrices of the two topperforming models – the fine-tuned ResNet18 and SqueezeNet
– when classifying the set of 3100 test images are shown in
Figures 12 and 13.

Another way to do this, is through the Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve, which provides the true positive
rate as a function of false positive rate. The ROC curve of these
four models is shown in Figure 11. All models have a similar performance according to the AUC with the SqueezeNet
achieving a slightly higher AUC than the other models. It is

4.7. The Heatmap of Potentially Infected Regions
We used a simple technique to detect the potentially infected
regions, while performing COVID-19 detection. This technique
is inspired by the work of Zeiler and Fergus [23], to visualize
the result of deep convolutional networks. We start from the
top-left corner of the image, and each time occluding a square
region of size NxN inside the image, and make a prediction

for training and evaluating future machine learning models for
COVID-19 binary classification task. We performed a detail experimental analysis evaluating the performance of each of these
4 models on the test set of of COVID-Xray-5k Dataset, in terms
of sensitivity, specificity, ROC, and AUC. For a sensitivity rate
of 98%, these models achieved a specificity rate of around 90%
on average. This is really encouraging, as it shows the promise
of using X-ray images for COVID-19 diagnostics. This study is
conducted on a set of publicly available images, which contains
around 200 COVID-19 images, and 5,000 non-COVID images.
The presented work is reflecting one of the earliest Covid-19
chest X-ray analysis and dataset preparation attempts, which
brings time-sensitive relevance in combining these two aspects.
However, due to the limited number of COVID-19 images publicly available so far, further experiments are needed on a larger
set of cleanly labeled COVID-19 images for a more reliable estimation of the accuracy of these models.

using the trained model on the occluded image. If occluding
that region causes the model to mis-classify a COVID-19 image
as Non-COVID, that area would be considered as a potentially
infected region in chest X-ray images (mainly because removing the information of that part led to model mis-classification).
On the other hand, if occluding a region does not impact the
model’s prediction, we infer that region is not infected. Once
we repeat this procedure for different sliding windows of NxN,
each time shifting them with a stride of S , we can get a saliency
map of the potentially infected regions in detecting COVID19. The detected regions for six example COVID-19 images
from our test set are shown in Figure 14. The likely regions
of COVID-19 disease marked by our board-certified radiologist are shown in blue on the last row. The generated heatmaps
show a good agreement with the radiologist-determined regions
of the COVID-19 disease.
5. Conclusion
We reported a deep learning framework for COVID-19 detection from Chest X-ray images, by fine-tuning four pre-trained
convolutional models (ResNet18, ResNet50, SqueezeNet, and
DenseNet-121) on our training set. We prepared a dataset of
around 5k images, called COVID-Xray-5k (using images from
two datasets), with the help of a board-certified radiologist to
confirm the COVID-19 labels. We make this dataset publicly
available for the research community to use as a benchmark
