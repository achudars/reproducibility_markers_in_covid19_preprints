Abstract: China’s policy interventions to reduce the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 have
environmental and economic impacts. Tropospheric nitrogen dioxide indicates economic
activities, as nitrogen dioxide is primarily emitted from fossil fuel consumption. Satellite
measurements show a 48% drop in tropospheric nitrogen dioxide vertical column densities from
the 20 days averaged before the 2020 Lunar New Year to the 20 days averaged after. This is 20%
larger than that from recent years. We relate to this reduction to two of the government’s actions:
the announcement of the first report in each province and the date of a province’s lockdown.
Both actions are associated with nearly the same magnitude of reductions. Our analysis offers
insights into the unintended environmental and economic consequences through reduced
economic activities.

One Sentence Summary: Chinese COVID-19 policies relate to fuel use.

In December 2019, a respiratory disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged in
Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China (1). COVID-19 has since spread worldwide causing tens of
thousands of deaths (2). To combat the spread of COVID-19, the Chinese government sealed off
several cities reporting large numbers of infected people, including Wuhan, starting January 23,
2020; this included halting public transportation and closing local businesses. These prevention
efforts quickly expanded nationwide. The policy announcements and restrictions, applied at an
unprecedented scale, have implications for the Chinese environment and the economy that we
quantitatively evaluate in this paper. In particular, we use satellite nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
measurements to monitor changes in fossil fuel usage, related to economic activity, over China
following the outbreak of COVID-2019. Nitrogen oxides (NO + NO2 = NOx), emitted during
high temperature combustion, are relatively short-lived in the atmosphere (lifetimes of the order
of hours near the surface), and therefore remain relatively close to their sources (3). NO2
tropospheric vertical column density (TVCD) retrieved from backscattered solar radiation, such
as from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI; 4), has been widely used to monitor both long
term and short-term changes in fuel consumption (5, 6). OMI’s successor, the Tropospheric
Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI; 7) offers a higher spatial resolution measurement of NO2
TVCD.
We observe substantial reductions of NO2 TVCD after the 2020 Lunar New Year (LNY) on
January 25, 2020. Figure 1 shows 20-day averages of OMI NO2 TVCD before, during and after
the 2020 LNY (hereafter referred to as the “pre”, “peri” and “post” periods). An average
reduction of 48% in NO2 TVCD over China is observed from pre to peri periods. Consistency in
2

the trends of retrieved NO2 TVCD is found between OMI and its successor TROPOMI (Figure
S1). A reduction in NO2 TVCD is typically observed during LNY because most Chinese
factories shut down for the holiday and the traffic volumes decrease, resulting in a decrease in
fuel consumption and thus NOx emissions. OMI NO2 TVCD shows an average pre to peri
decline of 26% from data covering the 2015 to 2019 period (Fig. S2). Similarly, TROPOMI
shows a reduction of 33% in 2019 (Fig. S3). This suggests that the observed reduction in 2020
far exceeds the typical holiday-related pre to peri period reduction.

Fig. 1. Average OMI tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities over China in 2020. (A) 20 to -1, (B) 0-19, and (C) 20-39 days relative to the 2020 Lunar New Year.
Consistent with the 2015–2019 data, the 2020 NO2 TVCD 7-day moving averages show a
significant reduction during approximately the two weeks leading up to LNY and reach a
minimum around LNY, consistent with the gradual shutdown of factories before the holiday
(Fig. 2). In prior years, a rebound of NO2 TVCD usually begins around 7 days after LNY,
marking the end of the holiday season. OMI and TROPOMI (Fig. S4) NO2 TVCDs show similar
temporal patterns prior to 2020 with a clear reduction before LNY and an increase shortly
3

thereafter. However, while the 2020 data show similar initial declines in the week leading up to
LNY, we do not observe the typical uptick in NO2 TVCDs starting the week after the LNY as in
previous years (Fig. 2). OMI (and TROPOMI) NO2 TVCDs show a longer period of low values
near the minimum. Note that the 2020 data are generally lower than previous years, probably
reflecting in part the effects of China’s clean air policies that require installation of
denitrification devices for all coal-fired power plants and cement plants (8).
To rule out the possibility that the large NO2 TVCD decreases observed in 2020 may be driven
by changes in the meteorological conditions affecting local NOx chemistry and NOx transport,
we use Goddard Earth Observing System version 5 Chemistry-Climate Model (GEOS-CCM; 9)
simulations with constant emissions. We find the simulated effects of meteorology on NO2
TVCD small as compared with the prolonged NO2 reduction we observe from the pre to peri
period (Fig. S5). The simulation with constant emissions shows many areas with increases from
the pre to peri periods (Fig. S6). This suggests that in many areas the actual decrease in NOx
emissions may be larger than what is inferred from the observed NO2 TVCDs.

Fig. 2. Daily variations in 7-day moving averages of OMI NO2 TVCDs over China. Shading
shows standard error of the mean. Points are plotted at the midpoint of the 7-day moving
average. Note that we account for the annually varying dates of the Lunar New Year.
Breaking these results down by sectors provides insights into the sources of reduction. All
sectors experienced dramatic NO2 reductions. We compute 7-day running averages for all OMI
observations within 0.25° gridboxes that contain large power plants or other industrial plants
with reported NOx emissions > 5 Gg/yr (Fig. S7). OMI NO2 TVCD averages for gridboxes
containing power plants and those for other industrial plants show similar temporal variations as
the national average (Fig. S8). This suggests that measures to reduce COVID-19 spread affected
power generation as well as industrial production including steel, iron, and oil. Direct NO2

5

reductions from transportation are indicated by the visually reduced TROPOMI NO2 TVCDs
along the China National Highways (Fig. S9).
We next explore how COVID-19 policy interventions (most of which happened to coincide with
the 2020 LNY) are associated with reductions in NO2 TVCD. First, we consider the
announcements the government made to the public (Table S1). Once the government publicly
reports that a COVID-19 case has been confirmed in a province, the public in that province
might choose to reduce their exposure to others (e.g., stay at home, work from home and/or
travel less). In that case, we would expect a reduction in NO2 TVCD following the
announcement of the first case in each province. This is indeed what we find, after taking
previous years’ NO2 TVCD and variation across provinces into account (see Eq. S1): following
the report of the first case in each province, OMI NO2 TVCD declined by about 27% (coeff = 1.383, p = 0.002, Table 1 Col. 1).
The second policy intervention is more invasive: the government took decisive action to further
reduce the spread of the virus by limiting the mobility of citizens and locking down entire
provinces; on average, lockdowns occurred 3.7 days after the report of the first case. We would
expect that a lockdown would be followed by a reduction in travel as well as business activity,
which in turn should lead to reductions of NO2 TVCD. Our model (Eq. S2) shows that OMI NO2
TVCD reduces by 24% following the lockdowns (coeff = -1.134, p < 0.001, Table 1 Col. 2).
Finally, we consider the two policies jointly (Eq. S3). We find that both the announcement of the
first case reported as well as the lockdown are associated with a reduction in NO2 TVCDs in
each province (Table 1 Col. 3). These results suggest that the effect of the announcement is about

6

as large (16%; coeff = -0.851, p = 0.043) as the effect of the lockdown (15%; coeff = -0.752, p <
0.001). All results are qualitatively similar using TROPOMI (Table S2).

Note. NO2 TVCD is based on OMI. We use a fixed-effects model (Eqs. S1-3) with first case announced and
lockdown coded as binary indicator variables. We control for the average 2015–2019 OMI NO2 TVCDs to adjust
for seasonal variation and include provinces’ fixed-effects to adjust for geographical variation. The “Constant” term
is the average province fixed-effect used as a baseline to compare the relative effect of the policy interventions. All
standard errors (shown in parentheses) are clustered at the province level. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.

NO2 reductions are closely related to improvements in air quality (10). Under normal
circumstances, many Chinese cities have poor air quality that reduces life quality and expectancy
(11). During the COVID-19 crisis, NO2 pollution was additionally reduced by ~20% for a period
of between 30 and 50 days. While temporary, these substantial reductions in air pollution may

7

have positive health impact for lives in otherwise heavily polluted areas (12). This unusual
period offers a rare counterfactual of a potential society which uses substantially less fossil fuels
and has lower mobility (13).
While this research provides an early insight into the NO2 changes in China in early 2020, our
findings are not without limitations. Because the relationship between NO2 TVCD and NOx
emissions is not strictly linear, the analysis of NO2 TVCD provides a qualitative description of
changes in NOx emissions. Accurately quantifying the changes in NOx emissions (14) is beyond
the scope of this initial assessment.
Our results suggest that the announcement of the first case was followed by a reduction in NO2
emissions, with a further reduction following the actual lockdown. However, it is important to
note that these results do not suggest that the mobility restrictions did not have a critical impact.
Indeed, recently published work suggests that the travel restrictions in China reduced the spread
of the disease by up to 80% by mid-February, in particular internationally (15). In line with our
results is the finding that human mobility was reduced early on during the outbreak (16) and may
in part have started as early as the first case announcements, with additional reductions through
lockdowns.

Materials and Methods
Satellite NO2 observations
We use retrieved NO2 TVCD from both OMI and TROPOMI. OMI is a Dutch-Finnish UVVIS spectrometer (4) on board the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
Aura satellite that was launched in 2004. TROPOMI is a UV-VIS-NIR-SWIR instrument (7) on
board the European Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite that was launched in 2017. Both
instruments similarly measure Earth radiance and solar irradiance spectra with spectral
resolutions of approximately 0.5 nm. The ratio of radiance to irradiance at wavelengths between
400 and 496 nm is used to retrieve NO2 TVCD. The ground footprint sizes are 13×24 km2 and
3.5×5.5 km2 (3.5×7 km2 before August, 2019) at nadir for OMI and TROPOMI, respectively.
Both instruments provide nearly daily to bi-daily global coverage with a local equator crossing
times close to 13:30 h. We use the version 4.0 NASA OMI standard NO2 products (17). We use
the version 1.0.0 TROPOMI Level 2 offline NO2 data products for 2019 and the version 1.1.0
data for 2020 (18). OMI and TROPOMI measurements are aggregated to resolutions of
0.25°×0.25° and 0.05°×0.05°, respectively. A given gridbox value is computed by averaging the
pixel-level satellite observations weighted by the amount of the pixel footprint that overlaps the
gridbox. We remove OMI observations with effective cloud fractions >30% to reduce retrieval
errors and those affected by the so-called “row anomaly” (19). For TROPOMI, we use only
observations with quality assurance values > 0.75.
For the maps shown, we calculate 20-day means of NO2 TVCD around the Lunar New Year
using OMI during 2015–2020 and TROPOMI for 2019 and 2020. We only include regions
dominated by anthropogenic NOx emissions in the analysis; these are defined as regions with
average annual OMI NO2 TVCDs > 1×1015 molec/cm2 over the period of 2005–2019 (Fig S7;
14

20). For time series analysis, we further compute 7-day running averages to smooth out daily
fluctuations in NO2 TVCD due to retrieval noise, including the effects of clouds, and influences
of meteorology (wind-driven transport influences NO2 TVCDs).

Sector information
We select facilities with reported NOx emissions > 5 Gg/yr (21). The locations of 245 heavy
industry plants including steel, iron, coke, oil, cement and glass industry, and 103 power plants
considered in this analysis are shown in Figure S7. We compute 7-day running averages of OMI
NO2 TVCD for gridboxes where large power plants and other industrial plants are located for
2020 (𝑇𝑉𝐶𝐷!"!" ) and the mean of 2015–2019 (𝑇𝑉𝐶𝐷''''''''''''''''
!"#$%!"#& ). We calculate the relative
difference as (𝑇𝑉𝐶𝐷!"!" − 𝑇𝑉𝐶𝐷!"#$%!"#&
'''''''''''''''' )/𝑇𝑉𝐶𝐷''''''''''''''''
!"#$%!"#& .

GEOS-CCM NO2 simulations
We ran the GEOS-CCM (9) with anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions of NOx and
other trace gas emissions held constant to simulate NO2 TVCD over China in order to estimate
the potential impact of meteorology on NO2 TVCDs from January to February, 2020. The
simulation uses the Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) chemistry mechanism (22) and the
Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport component of GEOS-5 (23, 24) to interact
with the GMI chemistry. The simulation’s meteorology is constrained by the Modern-Era
Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA2; 25) assimilated
meteorological data from the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) GEOS5 data assimilation system. The constant anthropogenic emissions are from the Representative
Concentration Pathways (RCP) 6.0 scenario (26) for January 2019, downscaled to higher

15

resolution using the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) version
4.3.2 (27) inventory. Constant biomass burning emissions are the January 2020 monthly mean
from the Quick Fire Emissions Dataset version 2 (QFED2; 28). This simulation includes 72
vertical levels at a spatial resolution of 0.25° (latitude and longitude) and a model time step of
7.5 minutes. We sample the model output only when and where there are valid satellite
observations.

Statistical analysis of policy responses
For the policy evaluation, we make use of the timing of when the Chinese government first
publicly reported that a person was infected with COVID-19, which occurred on several different
dates across the country’s provinces. The first public announcement of “viral pneumonia of
unknown cause” in Wuhan occurred on January 3, 2020. Daily public health statements began on
January 11, 2020, which included the new cases, deaths, and recoveries reported separately for
each province. Of particular interest for our analysis are the times when the government
announced the first case in each province (Table S1). We also use the exact timing when the
government put restrictive mobility policies in place, in order to reduce the likelihood of
transmission. The first such policy was put in place for Wuhan on January 23, 2020, followed by
more restrictions for other provinces shortly after (Table S1).
We conduct a statistical evaluation of the exact timing of the reduction in NO2 TVCDs.
While the 2020 Lunar New Year coincided roughly with the lockdown of most Chinese
provinces, the government’s policy actions actually took two forms and varied over time. The
first policy action was public announcements of new cases in each province, while the second
policy action was to restrict movement and order citizens to stay in-doors (which became known
16

as “lockdown”). We explore the timing of these two potential candidates—announcements of
new cases and restrictive mobility policies—to identify to what extent they are responsible for
NO2 TVCD reductions. We take advantage of the temporal variation of these measures across
the country.
To analyze the effects of these policies, we use fixed-effects models that predict
tropospheric NO2 TVCD, controlling for previous years’ NO2 TVCD as well as fixed effects for
each province:
𝑧(,* = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑥(,* + 𝛿𝑧*+,-+ + 𝑣* + 𝜀(,*

(S1)

where z is the outcome variable (daily NO2 TVCD for the period from 4 weeks before LNY to 8
weeks after LNY), x is an indicator variable on and after the first case is announced on day t in
province p (which remains 1 after the first case; otherwise coded as 0), zprior is the NO2 TVCD in
prior years (which is the average of years 2015 and 2019 for the OMI data and of the year 2019
for the TROPOMI data where prior data is only available for 2019), a is the average fixed effect
across all provinces and v is the fixed effect of province p (relative to a), and e is an error term
that is clustered at the province p.
To estimate the effect of the lockdown policy, we use the following fixed-effects model:
𝑧(,* = 𝛼 + 𝜆𝑦(,* + 𝛿𝑧*+,-+ + 𝑣* + 𝜀(,*

(S2)

where y is an indicator variable for the lockdown of the province p starting on day t (which is 1
during the time of the lockdown; otherwise coded as 0), and all other variables are as defined
above.
We use a similar fixed-effects model predicting the effect of both policies jointly:

17

𝑧(,* = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑥(,* + 𝜆𝑦(,* + 𝛿𝑧*+,-+ + 𝑣* + 𝜀(,*

(S3)

where all variables are as previously specified. β, λ and δ are the derived coefficients of the
model.
Using the above specified fixed-effect models enables us to estimate the effect of the policy
precisely, as we hold constant province-specific variation as well as prior year variation in NO2.
Our primary analysis uses OMI data (Table 1) but our results are qualitatively unchanged if we
use TROPOMI data (Table S2).

Meteorology
Figure S6 shows the relative pre (𝑇𝑉𝐶𝐷*+. ) to peri (𝑇𝑉𝐶𝐷*.+, ) period differences of NO2
TVCD in 2020 for OMI (Fig S6A) and GEOS-CCM simulations with constant emissions (Fig
S6B). We calculate the relative difference as (𝑇𝑉𝐶𝐷*.+, − 𝑇𝑉𝐶𝐷*+. )/𝑇𝑉𝐶𝐷*+. . The relative
changes from satellite observations for most areas in China are negative, with an average of 48%. The relative change of model-simulated (with constant emissions) TVCDs is 4% on
average; simulations show a positive change over most regions over China.
We use the difference in relative changes (Fig S6C) to represent the changes in NOx
emissions assuming that the relationship between NO2 TVCDs on NOx emissions is linear.
Considering that natural sources of NOx are significantly smaller than anthropogenic sources and
do not change rapidly over such short time, the differences are then presumed to be primarily due
to changes in anthropogenic NOx emissions. Decreases are widely observed, implying actual
decreases in NOx emissions.

Note. NO2 TVCD is based on TROPOMI. We use a fixed-effects model (Eqs. S1-3) with first case announced and
lockdown coded as binary indicator variables. We control for the previous year’s NO2 TVCD to adjust for seasonal
variation and include provinces’ fixed-effects to adjust for geographical variation. The “Constant” term is the
average province fixed-effect used as a baseline to compare the relative effect of the policy interventions. All
standard errors (shown in parentheses) are clustered at the province level. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
