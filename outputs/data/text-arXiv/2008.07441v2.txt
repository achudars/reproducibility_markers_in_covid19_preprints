Abstract
Distance education has expanded significantly over the last decade, but the natural sciences
have lagged in the implementation of this instructional mode. The abrupt onset of the COVID-19
pandemic left educational institutions scrambling to adapt curricula to distance modalities. With
projected effects lasting through the 2020–21 academic year, this problem will not go away soon.
Analysis of the literature has elucidated the costs and benefits of, as well as obstacles to, the
implementation of e-learning, with a focus on undergraduate physics education. Physics faculty
report that a lack of time to learn about research-driven innovation is their primary barrier to
implementing it. In response, this paper is intended to help physics lecturers and lab instructors rethink their courses now that distance learning is far more prevalent due to the pandemic. This paper
serves as an all-in-one guide of recommendations for successful distanced educational practices,
with an emphasis on smartphones and social media. These technologies were chosen for their
utility in a virtual environment. Additionally, this paper can be used as a resource for university
administrators to adapt to the changing needs associated with new teaching modalities.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Despite much debate, no consensus has been formed in the literature as to a universal
definition of e-learning.1–3 For the purposes of this paper, it is defined as “technology-based
learning in which learning materials are delivered electronically to remote learners via a
computer network.”4 E-learning can be divided into two categories: asynchronous and synchronous. The former is commonly implemented through a combination of pre-recorded
videos, email, and discussion boards. The latter is usually implemented through a combination of videoconferencing and chat platforms (Zoom, WebEx, Skype, etc.).5 Within the
literature, “virtual” learning often refers to synchronous methods, whereas “online” refers
to asynchronous.
From 2002–2016, distance enrollment at higher education institutions rose dramatically,
averaging an increase of 18.5% per year, largely driven by e-learning. Meanwhile, on-campus
enrollment dropped by 6.4% between 2012–2016.6,7 When compared to students in other
fields, undergraduate physical science students consistently rank near the bottom in terms
of the ratio of online to in-person classes taken. In the 2015–16 academic year, for example,
although 43.1% of the entire U.S. undergraduate population took an online course, only
32.8% of students in the physical sciences did so.8 However, a few universities have housed
online physics classes for decades, demonstrating the field’s ability to thrive over time.9–12
The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly impacted academic institutions, causing most US
universities to shut down on-campus classes and ousting students from their dormitories before the scheduled end of the 2019–20 school year. In an attempt to maintain instructional
continuity, teachers turned to videoconferencing and recordings of lectures, labs, and office
hour sessions. This change may be particularly detrimental to students within STEM subjects due to at-home students’ lack of access to instructional technologies critical to STEM
learning.13
This pandemic may therefore act as a motivator for physics faculty and administrators to
update curricula, adopt novel teaching modalities, and embrace research-based innovations.
This change is not unreasonable; a survey of U.S. physics faculty found that 92% reported
that their department encouraged improving instruction. Nearly half (48%) of the surveyed
faculty reported that they currently use at least one research-based innovation strategy in
their teaching. Unfortunately, 53% of those answering replied that the principal reason for
2

not using more research-driven innovations in their classroom is a lack of time (especially
time to research and implement changes).14,15 As a response, the aim of this manuscript
is to act as a brief but thorough guide for educators. This article presents an explanation
for some of the above trends, as well as specific guidance for implementing techniques and
e-learning systems in physics.
First, the benefits of, barriers to, and key factors for the implementation of physics elearning will be discussed. Next, the fact that e-learning has an unequal impact on students
from different demographic groups (based on gender, household income) is addressed. Following that, the smartphone will be introduced as an important educational tool for physics
e-learning. The smartphone can be very useful for both doing science (data collection,
analysis, demonstrations) as well as facilitating other technologies, such as social media.
Applications of social media in the traditional and virtual classrooms are then presented,
and their use is examined in depth. Other technologies for e-learning are then briefly introduced. Finally, the need for extensive institutional support to facilitate e-learning has
been widely recognized and thoroughly researched. Consequently, a guide for administrators on the keys to success in this implementation is presented. In all, it is the goal of
this manuscript to act as an easy-to-read comprehensive guide that may help to facilitate
e-learning in the physics community.

BENEFITS, BARRIERS, AND KEY FACTORS

E-learning has a well-documented array of benefits and drawbacks.4,16 Notably, it widens
access to education and offers opportunities for pedagogical improvements by instructors.17
However, due to its drawbacks, e-learning is plagued by low-retention rates.18–20
In recent years, studies have identified some areas where e-learning may be advantageous
for physics teaching, especially through the use of smartphones, online learning systems, and
social media. Each of these technologies can be implemented in the classroom for specific
tasks—e.g. by facilitating group interaction and feedback loops, or by encouraging interest
in coursework.21,22 By pairing these technologies with research-driven innovations, e-learning
can be made more effective for physics education, as will be elaborated upon in the following
sections.
As previously mentioned, electronic instruction of physics faces specific barriers not found
3

amongst teaching of the social sciences, humanities, and other natural sciences. First, elearning is less well-suited and less effective for science education that requires hands-on (e.g.
laboratory) instruction.16 Additionally, students often find it difficult to visualize physical
phenomena, especially those in 3-D (like the right-hand rule), through a screen.23 From a
structure standpoint, teachers tend to have low competency with technologies required for
e-teaching physics.24 These factors, when paired with the lack of community students feel in
online classes, contribute to higher withdrawal rates for online undergraduate introductory
physics courses than in-person classes.25
With these many costs and benefits in mind, it becomes clear that certain strategies for
implementing e-learning are key to its success. These best practices are well-documented and
extensively studied.26,27 The primary factors for successful and equitable e-learning include
that:
1. professional training is crucial and has been shown to improve teachers’ acceptance of
technology for physics instruction;21,28
2. real-time tech support is essential to successful instruction;29
3. participation in small-group collaborative learning correlates with deeper learning,
increased teamwork, and can increase students’ sense of community;30
4. mechanisms to directly combat high dropout rates for e-learners must be developed,
including communication with lower-achieving students;31 and
5. inequalities should be considered when implementing e-learning, especially their effect
on access to technology.

III.

ADDRESSING DEMOGRAPHIC CONCERNS

If e-learning is to be implemented equitably, economic concerns must be addressed. The
abrupt shift to an e-learning environment caused by COVID-19-induced closures generated
significant difficulties for lower income families across the globe. These closures “disproportionately affect vulnerable groups, in particular students with disabilities and those reliant
on their educational institution for food, shelter, residency, and safety.”32 Income-driven
disparities are worse in urban centers like New York City, where 10% of students were
4

homeless or had unstable housing last year.33,34 These cities are especially vulnerable to
COVID resurgences due to high population densities.
Data also shows that home computer availability in the U.S. scales with household
income.35 Alternatively, smartphone access is nearly ubiquitous amongst both teens and
adults; it is nearly uniform amongst people of varying gender, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.35,36 Smartphones also have utility in addressing other demographic differences,
such as empowering visually and hearing impaired students.37 The smartphone is evidently
a key tool to address educational inequality and improve physics education in the wake of
COVID-19, and will be discussed more thoroughly in the following section.
It is well known that sex and gender inequality is rampant in the sciences, especially in
physics. Although the percentage of female scientific authors increased substantially from
12% in 1955 to 35% in 2005, both physics and math still had female representations of
15%.38 Additionally, within the classroom, female students have fewer successful learning
and identity-forming experiences than males.39
Gender and socioeconomic differences can also be found in the use of technology for elearning.40 Although it has been shown that there is no difference in scientific literacy across
genders, males may show better performance in science practices because of their technological knowledge base formed from daily activity.41 Multiple studies have shown that the
success of technology is affected by gender differences in its perceived usefulness, perceived
ease of use, and attitude towards its use.42–48 Educators should therefore communicate with
their students to identify deficiencies in technological aptitude and comfort before electronic
course instruction. They should utilize feedback loops integrated into learning management
systems to continuously address the needs of underrepresented and disadvantaged students.
These support structures must be designed and backed by the educational institutions, as
teachers rarely have the resources or time to both develop their own feedback systems and
implement them within the classroom.
Lastly, when considering partial campus returns, household internet availability, technology access, and difficult home situations must be considered in selecting populations that
will be allowed to return for on-campus instruction. These actions will assist in making
science education more accessible and will address inequality prevalent in the sciences.

IV.

SMARTPHONES AS EDUCATIONAL TOOLS

Over the last decade, cell phones have increasingly distracted students in the classroom.
However, when teachers permit their use, smartphones can be effectively transformed into
a learning tool. They can facilitate the use of social media and learning management systems within and outside of the traditional classroom, and effectively complement other
technologies.49 Researchers have advocated for smartphone use in teaching, arguing that
smartphones offer benefits of “rich content deliverability, knowledge sharing, and dynamic
learning activities where students can expect to experience multiple channels of interactions
in learning.”50,51 Comprehensive lists of the advantages of smartphone use in the classroom
are readily available.37,52–54 Such advantages include the smartphone’s ability to encourage
collaborative learning, students’ existing familiarity with smartphones, and the fact that
96% of young adults (aged 18–29) in the U.S. own smartphones.36 Additionally, if implemented properly, smartphone use can raise curiosity about physics content while simultaneously introducing minimal distractions and having no dependence on gender, self-concept,
or experimental experience.55,56 This section will elaborate on the physics-specific uses and
advantages of smartphones for e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.
Smartphones are especially useful in laboratory settings due to their multitude of integrated high-precision sensors and analysis tools. As described by Kolb, “many teachers are
discovering that a basic cell phone can be the Swiss army knife of digital learning tools.”53
Such sensors include sound meters, accelerometers, magnetometers, proximeters, gyroscopes,
photometers, cameras, GPS, and barometers.57 In order to access these sensors directly, a
host of physics toolbox and lab function apps have been developed. Ideally, an app used for
data collection and analysis should be free, easy to use, intuitive, open-source, and allow for
processing and exportation of data as needed.58 Some examples of apps include the Physics
Toolbox Sensor Suite, phyphox, Sensor Kinetics, Sensors Toolbox, and Sensors Pro. The
former four are available as free apps (some with premium versions), while the latter is paid.
Table I contains a list of smartphone-based lab experiments that can be used in undergraduate (and high school) introductory physics labs with little other equipment. These
experiments are particularly relevant for planning post-COVID, on campus/small group
learning, where smartphones can be employed to limit the use of shared equipment. Table
II contains a similar list, but is specifically geared towards smartphone-based lab experi6

ments that can be conducted outside of the lab or at home. These experiments should be
adapted so that the lab instruction is aligned with AAPT Recommendations for the Undergraduate Physics Laboratory Curriculum.59 One process for implementing such a transition
has been explicitly laid out.60
It has been shown that smartphone experiments “may be more effective in improving
students’ understanding of acceleration with respect to traditional ‘cookbook’ and real-time
experiments,” with the most significant improvements seen in students’ critical deductive
thinking capability when designing their own experiments.137 In order to carry out this
approach, teachers are encouraged to adapt the POE method (predict-observe-explain) for
smartphone-based experiments—have students predict the results of an experiment, collect
data with smartphone sensors, and explain the resulting phenomenon theoretically. By
allowing students to utilize this method in association with familiar smartphone technology,
improvements in conceptual understanding of underlying phenomena can be achieved.
The smartphone can be utilized in lecture sections as well. For example, the slow motion
camera has been used to demonstrate center of mass rotation, the Doppler effect, a frustrated
Newton’s cradle, the falling chimney effect, and tautochrones.138 The smartphone can be
paired with external sensors like a thermal imaging camera to demonstrate phenomena such
as work and energy transfer within the body.139 Additionally, pairing smartphones with a
smart student response system can promote active physics learning in the classroom.37 These
uses of smartphones will help transform it into a device with utility in the virtual classroom
and laboratory.

V.

INTEGRATING SOCIAL MEDIA IN “THE CLASSROOM”

The pervasiveness of social media (SM) presents an intriguing opportunity for students
to collaborate on physics inside and outside of the traditional classroom. SM comprises an
array of online tools through which users can quickly create and share content digitally—e.g.
Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Wikipedia. The integration of SM within the learning
environment offers students self-agency in their learning and career planning. Despite these
positive attributes, most universities continue to rely on more conservative, established learning management systems and environments. Ignoring social media prevents educators from
capitalizing on the collaborative potential of social networks and the associated social skills

that students bring into the classroom.140 Concern due to privacy laws is a primary reason
that educators are relucant to use SM; to comply with these laws while using SM, instructors
should never share grades, records, or personal information via platforms not maintained by
the university. Furthermore, faculty who use SM for e-learning should discuss and include
a statement in their syllabi about proper conduct and expectations for online privacy, and
should also consult their university SM/privacy guidelines.141,142 Other reservations held by
faculty about the implementation of SM in the classroom include the following:35,143–148

1. Not all students have smartphone access (although, in the U.S., ∼95% do).
2. Cultural/Social—Instructors show reluctance because:
• there is a perceived erosion of traditional roles and difficulties in managing relationships with students;
• students may engage in inappropriate chatting; and
• language barriers and unconscious biases can lead to misunderstandings.
3. Pedagogical—Perceived usefulness is an important motivator for technology usage, but
instructors often rate SM poorly in this category. Many instructors perceive direct,
face-to-face relations with students as indispensable and more effective than SM use.
4. Administrative/Institutional—Instructors show reluctance because the success of
9

teaching technology is reliant on financial investment and institutional support provided by the university (elaborated in final section).
Not all instructors hesitate to employ SM in the classroom, and its uses vary by field. In
a survey of 459 secondary teachers, almost all teachers used SM in the class. There were,
however some differences in the modes of use; for example, teachers in the natural sciences
used SM less often for the facilitation of self-regulated learning.149 Conversely, another study
showed that university faculty used SM less (41% of faculty use at least one tool on a monthly
basis). Younger faculty used SM more than their colleagues, particularly Twitter—though
it was concluded that age differences require further investigation. Math, computer science,
and natural science faculty used SM less than those in humanities and social sciences.143
The tendency for natural science faculty to use SM less than their colleagues is attributed
to “a lack of relevant content on social media sites for their particular discipline.”146 The
dearth of relevant content has been explained by a trend in faculty consuming rather than
producing digital resources (which requires a large time investment).150 Science faculty, as a
result, tend to prefer blogs/Wikipedia and Youtube/Vimeo information sources to promote
collaborative learning, rather than Facebook/Twitter type communication SM channels.143
To demonstrate the effectiveness of SM within the classroom and to address the barriers
presented previously, some specific examples can be offered. One principle of high-impact
online education is faculty/teaching assistants providing timely feedback to students outside
of class.144,151 This task can be assisted through SM communication channels. For example,
WhatsApp can facilitate student-teacher interaction within online college courses.152 Connecting with students outside of classroom hours through WhatsApp can permit physics
teachers to identify problems that are not recognized during the traditional class hours.153
Other similar messaging apps including Slack, Discord, GroupMe, and Google Hangouts can
replace WhatsApp with similar functionality. Overall, SM helps teachers share information,
questions, and insights to promote curiosity in physics.145
Perhaps of most importance, a lack of community is often blamed for the high withdrawal rates of online learning.154 Microblogging (e.g. Twitter) has been shown to combat
this flaw, strengthening a sense of community in virtual classes within higher education.155
Classroom-specific Twitter threads can be used to provide course updates and facilitate
academic conversations in a manner familiar to students.156,157 WhatsApp can be employed
to encourage student-student messaging and sharing of ideas.152 Similarly, the use of Face10

book groups for sharing ideas and support, asking questions, and participating in discussions
has been shown to promote a virtual student learning community.158 Therefore, integration
of SM—especially through inclusive technologies such as the smartphone—can be key to
battling low retention rates in virtual education during the COVID-19-induced closures.
Research on innovative practices is crucial for adapting to changing learning environments. Sharing of effective practices can assist in the re-thinking of pedagogies, and could
shift attitudes from resistance to a welcomeness in using SM to assist and improve physics
teaching in higher education.

VI.

OTHER NOVEL AT-HOME TECHNIQUES

Smartphone use is a promising way to do physics at home, but other technologies can
be used in complement with smartphones or can replace them for various e-learning tasks
when they are unsuitable. For example, experimental kits provide students the opportunity
to conduct physics right on the kitchen table, and can be instructor-provided or studentassembled. Such kits have been implemented in the classroom,159 for massive open online
courses (MOOCs),160 in open universities,161 for in-class demonstrations,162 and for experimental distance learning.163,164 Kits can even be paired with smartphones as data collection
and analysis devices to increase student comfort with the experiments.
Given the inaccessibility of physical laboratory equipment, experiments can also be conducted remotely. Virtual and remote labs have been around since commercialized internet
became prevalent across the world, and their use has expanded significantly over time.165,166
These are real experiments (housed at hosting institutions) which are accessed and controlled by individual users through the internet.167,169 One such facility is FARLabs, led by
La Trobe University, which allows users to remotely access lab technologies for real-time
experiments.168 Some researchers are endeavoring to promote remote labs through sharing
economy platforms such as LabsLand.170 Remote experiments can be used to teach many
aspects of physics, for example, radioactivity171 and electronics.172 Such a platform provides clear financial advantages over physical analogs. These platforms also allow for better
student access to equipment, increased scheduling flexibility, a wider range of possible assignments and activities, and more opportunities for student-student collaboration.173
For instructional demonstrations of concepts and simple experiments simulations can be
11

extremely useful. Simulations have been used in the physics classroom for many years,174 and
much research has been conducted on successful approaches for their use.175 Two such simulation bases are the PhET project developed by the University of Colorado and PhysClips of
the University of New South Wales.176,177 Many simulations and other resources can also be
found on The Physics Source at AAPT’s ComPADRE site.178 Simulations can be especially
advantageous for instructors struggling with the extra preparation time required for online
courses.
Lastly, free online materials can be useful and are often overlooked.179 Whereas YouTube
videos—such as those generated by Physics Girl, minutephysics, etc.—might be used by
students intermittently, the consistent use of resources such as Khan Academy and HyperPhysics can fill gaps in student knowledge, or act as a support system for a struggling
student.180 Lists of similar online resources can be found readily.181

VII.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INSTITUTIONAL ADMINISTRATORS

Whereas this manuscript is aimed at assisting physics educators shift to online learning,
effective recommendations for implementing e-learning necessarily include an administrative
component.182 The effectiveness of pandemic-induced e-learning will depend on educational
institutions realigning with and embracing the necessary structural changes associated with
it.31,183 Such changes are outlined below.
1. Online mental health and medical services should be expanded.184 It was found that
20–35% of the 2,530 surveyed students and workers at a Spanish university reported
moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress after COVID-19 school
closures.185 Similarly, nearly half (46%) of Australian young people studying at home
are “vulnerable to adverse effects on their educational outcomes, nutrition, physical
movement, social, and emotional wellbeing.”186 Universities (and other educational
institutions) are recommended to:
• expand the availability of online counseling services; and
• encourage faculty to employ technology as a means to increase interactivity, enrich learning, and enhance the student experience, .
12

2. Direct financial investment into e-learning should be a priority.31 An analysis of blended
learning at one university showed that student satisfaction was best predicted by the
availability of university resources.187 Another study showed that the top facultyidentified needs for successful e-learning are multimedia development support and
real-time help desks.29 Universities are recommended to:
• make expenditures related to internet access necessary for hybrid approaches;188,189
• engage in hiring or contracting of support staff for IT;29 and
• ensure proper compensation for instructors; (this is important for quality online
instruction190 ).
3. Pedagogical research, data collection, and evidence-based practices focused on elearning should be expanded. Student feedback can be motivated by effective communication mechanisms integrated into a student’s online learning space,191,192 and has
been shown to be of great value in improving blended course quality.187 Universities
are recommended to:
• organize a system to analyze feedback data, identiffy problem points, delegate
responsibility for addressing them, and report back to the students on resulting
actions.193 Integrating easy-access course feedback into virtual learning management system is an excellent way to “close the feedback loop”; and
• adopt a hiring and promotion process that factors in teaching achievement
through student feedback. This will help incentivize research-driven innovation
and teaching practices in the classroom.
4. Teacher training capabilities for multiple modes of e-learning should be expanded.31
Training is essential to the effective delivery of electronic physics instruction,194 and has
been demonstrated to lead to instructors’ enthusiastic acceptance of mobile technology
for teaching.21,28
A general outline of the contributions necessary from administrators, faculty, and students
is offered in Fig. 1. As learning institutions resume education during COVID-19, faculty
should encourage administrators to adopt these recommendations as they are essential to
the success of education under circumstances induced by the pandemic.

CONCLUSIONS

The COVID-19 pandemic thrust learners and educators across the world into a new environment, in which e-learning became the foremost method of education. As the community
is unsure about how this pandemic will persist, it is of paramount importance to embrace
e-learning in physics education. First, demographic concerns were addressed, including
technology’s association with income and gender differences in physics. Consideration of
demographics is key to the equitable implementation of e-learning. Second, it was proposed
that adopting research-driven innovation will help teachers adapt curricula to the changing
needs of students in the wake of the pandemic. The smartphone was explored as an educational tool; its advantages in the classroom and its range of sensors and apps for use in
the laboratory were identified. Nearly 80 examples of smartphone-based lab and at-home
introductory physics experiments were provided and sorted by subject. Following that, a
guide for the use of social media as a classroom tool was presented. While smartphones and
social media are key for some aspects of e-learning, other technologies like remote labs and
experimental kits can complement their use effectively. Lastly, a guide for institutional administrators was offered. This guide highlighted the need for online mental health/medical
services, financial investment in e-learning, pedagogical research initiatives, and teacher
training. This manuscript should be utilized by the physics community as a whole to help
guide the implementation of fruitful electronic learning practices.
