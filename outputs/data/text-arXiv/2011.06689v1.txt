The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic
that is ravaging Nigeria and the world at large. This data
article provides a dataset of daily updates of COVID-19 as
reported online by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control
(NCDC) from February 27, 2020 to September 29, 2020. The
data were obtained through web scraping from different
sources and it includes some economic variables such as the
Nigeria budget for each state in 2020, population estimate,
healthcare facilities, and the COVID-19 laboratories in Nigeria. The dataset has been processed using the standard of the
FAIR data principle which encourages its ﬁndability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability and will be relevant to
researchers in different ﬁelds such as Data Science, Epidemiology, Earth Modelling, and Health Informatics.

A data on the multidimensional study of the effect of COVID-19 on
Government budgets, healthcare facilities, and COVID-19 testing laboratories in
Nigeria.
Tables, Charts, and Maps
Data were collected from different sources such as NCDC, Geo-Referenced
Infrastructure and Demographic Data for Development (GRID3), Geographic
Population and Demographic Data (GeoPoDe), and National Bureau of Statistics
(NBS). Some data were acquired directly from the host website using the
Google Sheets function IMPORTHTML().
The daily updates of COVID-19 in Nigeria were also scrapped from NCDC
timeline on Twitter (twitter.com/NCDCgov) using the rtweet package in R
programming [15].
The raw datasets are in Microsoft Excel format and is available on the
Mendeley data repository.
Parameters for data collection comprises:
1. Geographical coordinates of all the 36 states and the Federal Capital
Territory (FCT).
2. Population estimates of 0 to 100 years per state and by gender.
3. A cumulative report of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria per state.
4. Initial budget presented and the revised budget due to COVID-19 per state
in Nigeria.
5. The state initial budget and the revised budget due to COVID-19.
6. Total healthcare facilities in Nigeria per state.
7. COVID-19 laboratories per state.
8. Daily updates of COVID-19 in Nigeria.
9. COVID-19 by the six (6) geopolitical zones in Nigeria.
10. NCDC daily tweets and retweets.

Description of data collection

The description of data collection is as follows:
 The COVID-19 related dataset which included cases by State and
laboratories were collected from the NCDC website [3] while daily
COVID-19 cases in Nigeria were collected from NCDC Twitter updates [4].
 The initial and revised states’ budget due to COVID-19 were collected from
various news channels in Nigeria [5].
 The population estimate per state and by gender were collected from the
GeoPoDe [8].
 The healthcare facilities per state were collected from GRID3 [6].

Value of the Data
• This data explains the effect of COVID-19 on the economy of Nigerian States in terms of
budget reallocation and adjustment, and it will be useful for multidimensional studies while
carrying out any post-COVID research on Nigeria by government agencies, international organizations and individual researcher.

• The data can help the government of Nigeria prepare the economy better for future pandemics (if any), and it serves as a basis for the appraisal of state government’s performance
at the end of the ﬁscal year.
• Data scientists can get hidden information and detect novel patterns from the data which can
then be used to train different machine learning models to predict the future of COVID-19 in
Nigeria.
• Public health services and disease control institutions can use the data for effective planning
using its information on the facilities related to COVID-19 in the Nigerian States.
• It is also relevant for qualitative research works on expert opinion mining on the outbreak
to determine both people and government’s sentiments on different control measures.

1. Data Description
The World Health Organisation (WHO) announced Coronavirus (COVID-19) as a Public Health
Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020 and a Pandemic on March 11, 2020 [1].
The COVID-19 pandemic pushed the global economy into a Great Lockdown, schools were shut
down, travels banned, social distancing enforced, and many jobs were lost. The rate of the spread
of the virus keeps increasing, yet no deﬁned countermeasure, remedy or well-tested medications
are handy for its eradication. Nigeria recorded her ﬁrst case of COVID-19 on Thursday, February
27, 2020, and ever since there has been an exponential growth and spread of the virus all over
the country. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, there have been some negative changes in the economy
of Nigeria such as the total/partial lockdown, banning of international ﬂights, decrease in the
national revenue by over N320 billion, a downward revision of each state’s budget, building of
isolation centers, loss of jobs, and shutting down of schools [2]. This article presents datasets
that are related to COVID-19 as reported by the NCDC, healthcare facilities, and laboratories for
testing it, and population estimate by gender and budget for all the 36 states of Nigeria and the
Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The datasets are in the Microsoft Excel Workbook with ﬁve (5)
sheets as presented in Fig. 1.
Sheet 1 This sheet comprises the following features for each state in Nigeria: geocoordinates,
population by gender, COVID-19 cases, healthcare facilities, COVID-19 Government laboratories, budget, and total available revenue in 2019.
Sheet 2 This sheet comprises daily cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria as reported by NCDC on
https://twitter.com/NCDCgov.
Sheet 3 This sheet shows the aggregate of COVID-19 cases in the six (6) geopolitical zones in
Nigeria which includes North-Central (Benue, Kogi, Kwara, Nasarawa, Niger, Plateau, and
the FCT), North-East (Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Taraba, Yobe), North-West (Jigawa,
Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Sokoto, Zamfara), South-East (Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu,

Sheet 4 This sheet shows the general COVID-19 testing laboratories in Nigeria.
Sheet 5 This sheet contains NCDC daily tweets from December 1, 2019 to September 29,
2020.
The datasets were collected through web scraping of different sources with features referenced and described in Table 1. They contain the daily updates of conﬁrmed, recovered and
death cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria [4], cumulative laboratory conﬁrmed cases, patients on admission, number of patients discharged, number of death cases, discharge rate and fatality rate
of COVID-19 per state in Nigeria [3], COVID-19 Government laboratories [3], total healthcare facilities per state in Nigeria [6], initial, revised, and percentage budget reduction due to COVID-19
[5] total revenue available per state in 2019 [7], and the population estimate per state from 2016
to 2017 [8].

1.1. Nigeria population estimate and healthcare facilities
The Nigeria population estimate per state and the FCT in Fig. 2 was generated from the data
that was produced by the WorldPop Research Group at the University of Southampton [8] and
it represented bottom-up gridded population estimates (∼100 m grid cells) from 2016 to 2017.

Fig. 4 shows the distribution of COVID-19 for each geopolitical zone. It can be seen that
COVID-19 affected the South-West region more when compared to other zones in Nigeria.
1.2.2. COVID-19 laboratories in Nigeria
To contain the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria, the government of each state has taken the decision in line with the NCDC directives to equip laboratories and provide testing kits for COVID19. The government laboratories were spread across the six (6) geopolitical zones and they are
as follows: North-East (7, 10.4%), South-East (8, 11.9%), North-Central (15, 22.4%), South-West (15,
22.4%), North-West (12, 17.9%) and South-South (10, 14.9%) as shown in Fig. 5.
Figs. 6 and 7 show different kinds of COVID-19 testing laboratories at which anyone can test
for COVID-19 in Nigeria and they include government laboratories, fee paying private laboratories, and corporate laboratories. Corporate laboratories are owned by the corporate bodies such
as Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria. As reported by NCDC, a laboratory can

serves Osun and Ondo States [3].

1.3. Budget analysis
Before the incidence of COVID-19 in Nigeria, all the 36 states including the FCT had presented
2020 budgets to their respective House of Assemblies while some had even signed the appropriation bill into law. According to the data that we collated for the initial 2020 states budget, the
36 states and FCT had budgeted a total sum of N10.220 trillion for 2020 compared to the total
sum of N9.140 trillion budgeted in 2019. The South-South region with the following states; Cross
River, Akwa Ibom, Rivers, Delta, Bayelsa, Edo and in the order of budget ranking has the highest budget of N3.045 trillion combined while the South-West region with the following states;
Lagos, Ogun, Oyo, Ekiti, Ondo, Osun and in the order of budget ranking has a total budget of
N2.774 trillion as shown in Fig. 8.
All the 36 states excluding the FCT reduced their cumulative budget of N9.941 trillion to
N6.131 trillion, making 38.32 % budget reduction due to COVID-19 as shown in Fig. 9.
As shown in Fig. 9, the top ﬁve states that have the highest initial budget are Lagos (N1.68
trillion), Cross River (N1.1 trillion), Akwa Ibom (N597.73 billion), Rivers (N530.8 billion) and Ogun
(N449.9 billion) while the top 5 states with the highest revised budget due to COVID-19 are Lagos (N920.5 billion), Akwa Ibom (N366 billion), Rivers (N300.4 billion), Delta (N282.3 billion)
and Ogun (N280 billion). This suggests that COVID-19 really affected the Cross River state economy forcing them to reduce their budget by 86.63% as shown in Fig. 10 thereby making their
initial budget of N1.1 trillion unrealistic.
Also, as shown in Table 2, the South-South region reduced their budget of N3.045 trillion by
53.77% while the South-West region reduced their budget of N2.77 trillion by 38.76%.

2. Experimental Design, Materials and Methods
We organized our various datasets using tidy principles; each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table [9]. Tidy datasets are always
easy to manipulate and visualize. Majority of the data wrangling was done in R programming

version 4.0.2 while the dataset resides in the Microsoft Excel 2016. Packages used in R included
dplyr and ggplot2 for data analysis and visualization [10,11]. We also used the readxl package
[12] to import the Excel ﬁle to R programming and the janitor package [13] to clean the data.
We used xts package [14] to create an extensible time-series object which can be ordered by
time index to plot the daily updates of COVID-19 conﬁrmed, recovered and death cases in Nigeria as shown in Figs. 11 to 13. Dataon NCDC timelines on Twitter was scrapped using rtweet
[15] and the frequency of daily tweets and retweets from December 1, 2019 to September 29,
2020 is shown in Fig. 14 while most of the common words found in the tweets are shown in
Fig. 15.
Fig. 16 shows the frequency of most common words found in NCDC tweets at various COVID19 phases in Nigeria which were partitioned into pre-lockdown (December 1, 2020 to March
29, 2020), lockdown (March 30, 2020 to May 4, 2020), and lockdown easing (May 5, 2020 to
September 29, 2020) to provide a deep understanding and variation in the importance of the
mentioned words in Fig. 15. For example, it could be seen that the word ‘takeresponsibility’ is
more frequently used during the lockdown and easing phases.
We carried out most of the data visualization in RStudio and also used Tableau and CorelDRAW to bring out those visualizations into perfect shape. RStudio project script can be found
via https://bit.ly/COVID-19data_project_repo.
