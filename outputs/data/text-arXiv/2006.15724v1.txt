Without a vaccine, the fight against the spreading of the coronavirus has focused on maintaining
physical distance. To study the impact of such measures on inter-municipality traffic, we analyze
a mobile dataset with the daily flow of people in Portugal in March and April 2020. We find that
the reduction in inter-municipality traffic depends strongly on its initial outflow. In municipalities
where the mobility is low, the outflow reduced by 10 − 20% and this decrease was independent of
the population size. Whereas, for municipalities of high mobility, the reduction was a monotonic
increasing function of the population size and it even exceeded 60% for the largest municipalities.
As a consequence of such heterogeneities, there were significant structural changes on the most
probable paths for the spreading of the virus, which must be considered when modeling the impact
of control measures.
I.

INTRODUCTION

In response to the coronavirus pandemics, many governments have imposed lockdowns, closing several public places, such as, schools, restaurants, sport centers,
and shopping malls [1]. Companies and public services
have opted for giving employees the choice to work from
home [2]. These non-pharmacological interventions are
believed to be responsible for a significant slowdown of
the spreading in different countries [3–10]. However, one
still lacks an understanding on how the mobility patterns
have changed and how such changes affect the most probable pathways for the spread of the virus.
With digitalization and advancements in global data
collection, the public expectations for knowledge-based
strategies to control the spreading of the coronavirus have
been high. Daily, the public is swamped with statistics
about new infections, deaths, and recoveries around the
world [11, 12]. Models and metrics are being proposed
and further developed to turn data into actionable insights [13]. But, statistics of demographic variations of
the impact of a virus are not enough. An extensive body
of research on recent public health threats, such as the
2013 MERS-CoV, 2014 Ebola, and 2016 Zika viruses, has
shown that to estimate the spread and implement efficient actions for controlling it, one needs to rigorously
investigate the mobility patterns [14–17]. Depending
on the level of granularity, mobility data might be obtained from civil aviation statistics [18, 19], national censuses [19, 20], public transit ridership [21–23], or mobile

phone tracking [20, 24]. By May 2020, there were more
than 60k travel restrictions issued around the world to
control inter- and intra-country travelling [25]. The mobility patterns today are very different from the ones in
February 2020 and these publicly available data sets are
no longer representative.
Epidemic spreading is a network-driven process [24,
26–28]. To understand the complex spatiotemporal
spreading dynamics, one needs to replace the traditional
view based on geographical distance by a probabilistically motivated effective distance computed from the flux
of people [29]. With such a change of paradigm, one can
identify the set of most probable paths for the spreading
of the virus and the relative arrival times of an epidemics,
which are both independent of the epidemic parameters.
Thus, the role of a municipality on the global dynamics
depends on its daily flow and effective distance to other
municipalities.
Here, we study this impact by analyzing mobile phone
data for the inter-municipality daily flow of people in
Portugal in March and April 2020. The first confirmed
case of COVID-19 in Portugal was reported on March 2,
2020. Ten days later, the total number of cases added up
to 78 and the government announced a first set of control
measures, which included school closures from March 14
onward. With a total of 642 identified cases, on March 19,
the government decided to declare the state of emergency
to impose more drastic measures of mobility restriction
and social distance. We show that, the impact of the
different measures was neither instantaneous nor homogeneous throughout the country. It extended over several
days and the relative impact was strongly dependent on
the population size of the municipality. We also analyze
how the changes in mobility impacted on the distances.

Relative Mobility (%)

FIG. 1. Effect of the lockdown in the mobility pattern of residents and non–residents in Portugal. The relative
mobility is calculated as the total number of people that moved between two different municipalities on that day divided by the
average between March 2 and 6 (see Materials and Methods for further details). The first control measures were announced in
March 12, and the state of emergency was declared on March 18. We see that after the lockdown the mobility of residents and
non–residents decreased to about 20% and 45% of the baseline. The maps show the spatial distribution of the relative mobility
for three specific days (March 9, March 19, and April 23), for residents (R1, R2, and R3) and for non–residents (N1, N2, and
N3).

We show that the effective distances changed differently
for each municipality. The structure of the set of most
probable paths and relative arrival times also changed,
with a significant impact on the spreading dynamics.
II.

RESULTS

We analyze a national-scale mobile dataset provided
by NOS, a Portuguese telecommunication company. This
dataset contains the daily number of people that moved
within and between municipalities in Portugal in March
and April 2020, obtained from the mobile recurrent usage
of residents and non-residents (see Materials and Methods for further details). The non-residents are defined as
users with a SIM card from a foreign mobile network. A
user is registered in the dataset if they stay for, at least,
60 minutes within the boundaries of a municipality (see
Materials and Methods for further details).
To quantify the inter-municipality mobility, we measure the daily number of users moving within and between municipalities and define relative mobility as this
number rescaled by the average mobility from March 2
to 6 (baseline), which is a period before any control measure. In Fig. 1, we show the time dependence of the relative mobility averaged over all municipalities for residents
and non–resident users. Even before the declaration of
the state of emergency (March 18), with the first set of
control measures (March 12), the mobility started to decrease. However, this change in mobility was not instantaneous, it occurred over several days and only reached a
steady level after March 21, with a decrease of about 20%
for residents and 45% for non–residents. The periodic
structure observed in the steady regime corresponds to

the expected weekday (Monday to Friday) and weekend
(Saturday to Sunday) differences, with a clear decrease
in mobility during the weekends. In the same figure, we
show also the spatial distribution of the relative mobility
for three different days (March 9, March 19, and April
23). One sees that, the impact of the control measures
was heterogeneous throughout the country. To characterize these heterogeneities, in what follows, we analyze
the inter–municipality mobility. Since only 3.3% of the
users are non-residents, for simplicity, we consider only
the resident one.
The origin–destination matrix (OD) is defined such
that each element Pij (d) is the fraction of users that,
in day d, stayed for more than 60 minutes in both municipalities i and j (see Materials and Methods). From
the OD matrix, we obtain the mobility network, which
is a weighted directed graph, where the nodes are the
municipalities and the weight of the link ij is Pij . Note
that, in general, Pij 6= Pji , as the total number of users in
each municipality is different (see Materials and Methods
for further details). The mobility network sets the stage
for the propagation to other municipalities. As shown in
Ref. [29], further insight into the propagation dynamics
is obtained from the mobility network if we compute the
effective distance Deff between nodes, defined as follows.
For each pair of nodes i and j, we defined the length of
the link as `ij = 1 − log(Pij ). Thus, the most probable
path between two nodes ij is the shortest path between
the two, defined as the one that minimizes the sum of
ij
all ` along the path. The effective distance Deff
is then
the value of such sum [29]. For every municipality i, we
can obtain the shortest–path tree, consisting of the set
of the most probable paths to all the other municipalities, where the central node is the origin i. In Fig. 2, we

proportional the effective distance Deff , as defined in the Materials and Methods. The effective distances are calculated from the
origin–destination matrix of the average mobility between March 2 and 6. The nodes are colored according to the geographical
distance to the central node. In the bottom row are the country maps, where the color of each municipality is given by the

show three examples of the shortest–path trees, for (A)
Lisbon, (B) Braga, and (C) Campo Maior, using an OD
matrix obtained from the average mobility from March 2
to 6. All nodes are placed at a distance from the central
node proportional to their effective distance to it. For
the sake of comparison, the color of a node is given by
the geographic distance from the central node. The size
of the node is given by the value of the betweenness centrality, which is defined as the number of shortest paths
that go from the central node to any other node on the
tree through that node. In the figure, below each tree, we
also show a color map displaying the spatial distribution
of effective distances from each center. It is clear that,
some municipalities can be geographically far from the
central municipality, but have a small value of effective
distance, indicating that the relation between effective
distances and geographic distances are non-trivial.
Since the change in mobility was heterogeneous
throughout the country, as shown in Fig. 1, it is expected that both the effective distances and structure
of the shortest–path trees have changed. To illustrate
such changes, we show in Fig. 3(A) the time evolution of
the shortest–path tree for Lisbon. We discover a change
from a star-like structure to a more branched structure.

Figure 3(B) shows the time evolution of the average effective distance hDeff i to all other municipalities for Lisbon,
Braga, and Campo Maior. With the lockdown, hDeff i increased, consistent with a much slower propagation dynamics. The maximum on the Easter holidays (gray region) is reflective of a set of additional measures imposed
by the Portuguese government for those days to avoid
the traditional family gatherings, which included severe
restrictions to the inter-municipality mobility. For each
day d, we calculated the Spearman’s correlation between
the effective distance Deff (d) and the initial effective distance Deff , obtained from the average mobility network
from March 2 to 6 (before the lockdown). The Spearman’s correlation r for the entire set of municipalities is
defined as
r=

cov(rkd , rk)
,
σ(rkd )σ(rk)

(1)

where rkd is the rank of Deff (d), rk is the rank of Deff ,
cov(rkd , rk) is the covariance of the rank, and σ(rk) is
the standard deviation. An r = 1.0 means that the rank
of effective distances has not changed, while r = 0 corresponds to a new rank that is uncorrelated from the original one. The daily evolution of r is shown in Fig. 3(C).

FIG. 3. The effect of the lockdown on the mobility network. (A) Shortest–path tree from Lisbon for three different days.
The position of the nodes is given by the Fain Hu layout [30], designed to distribute symmetrically the nodes and minimize
edge crossing. The color of each node is given by the effective distance from Lisbon. (B) Time dependence of the average
effective distance in the shortest–path trees shown in Fig. 2. Before the lockdown, for these three municipalities, Lisbon had
the shortest average distance to the rest of the country, followed by Braga and Campo Maior. With control measurements,
the three average effective distances increased, reaching a maximum in the Easter holidays, when the Portuguese government
imposed more severe mobility restrictions to inter-municipality travels. (C) Spearman’s correlation coefficient r between the
effective distance from the average origin–destination matrix from March 2 to 6, and all the days of March and April. With the
lockdown, the rank of the effective distances have changed as shown. (C) Time evolution of the node degree k (number of edges)
for Lisbon, Braga, and Campo Maior, for the shortest–path trees shown in Fig. 2. Initially, Lisbon was connected directly to
more than 90% of the municipalities. With the lockdown, the k decreases reaching a minimum at the Easter holidays, with
only less than 50% of the municipalities connected with Lisbon by only one edge.

For the three municipalities, r decreased with the lockdown. This result suggests that the hierarchical organization of municipalities in a spreading process was affected
significantly by the lockdown.
Figure 3(D) depicts the evolution of the degree k of the
central node (Lisbon, Braga, and Campo Maior), corresponding to the number of municipalities that are directly connected to the central node in the shortest–path
tree. Before the lockdown, Lisbon was connected by a
single edge to 90% of the municipalities. With the lockdown, Lisbon, in average, became only connected directly
to 55% of the municipalities. This is in line with a change
from a star-like to a branched structure, as observed in
Fig. 3(A). We see a similar behavior for Braga, starting
with the fraction of municipalities connected directly, decreasing from 58% to 33%, and for Campo Maior, where
the drop is from 23% to 15%.
In Fig. 4, we compare the outflow before and after the

lockdown. The outflow is defined as the total number of
resident users of a municipality that were also identified
in a different municipality during the day (see Materials
and Methods). The values before the lockdown are averages from March 2 to 6 and after the lockdown from
April 13 to 17. We find that, although the control measures were the same for the entire country, their impact
on the outflow strongly depends on the initial value of the
outflow. For municipalities with low values of outflow, we
observe a linear relation between the outflows before and
after, which suggests that the relative impact is the same.
However, for the municipalities with higher values of the
outflow, we observe a sublinear relation between the two.
The larger the initial value of the outflow the stronger is
the impact of the control measures. Since the outflow
of a municipality correlates strongly with the population
size [32], in the inset of Fig. 4, we plot the relative decrease in outflow as a function of the population size.

Outflow Before the Lockdown
FIG. 4. The impact of the lockdown depends on the
mobility pattern of the municipality. Outflow of each
municipality before and after the lockdown. To reduce the
statistical noise, the outflow corresponds to averages over five
days: before any control measurements, we considered March
2 to 6, and for after the lockdown April 13 to 17. Each colored
circle is a municipality and the black solid line is a guide for
the eyes and corresponds to a linear relation between the two.
The color of each data point represents the population size of
the municipality, following the log-spaced bins shown in the
inset. We can see that the effect of the lockdown is not homogeneous across the country, municipalities with large values
of mobility at the beginning of March showed a large reduction in April. In the inset is the relative change on outflow of
each municipality (cyan circles) as a function of its population
size. The relative change is calculated by the outflow difference between March and April divided by the one in March.
The colors are given by the average relative change on outflow
in log-spaced bins (based on the population size). The dashed
lines are best fits for a logarithmic dependence of the relative
mobility (RO) on the population size (P). For smaller municipalities (< 18000 people), we find RO = 0.034 log10 (P )−0.25,
while for the larger ones RO = −0.27 log10 (P ) + 1.02. The
population for each municipality was obtained from Ref. [31].

For municipalities with less than 18000 users, the outflow
decreased by 10 − 20%, without a clear dependence on
the population size. Whereas, for larger municipalities,
the relative decrease in the outflow scales logarithmically
with the population size (dashed line) and it exceeds 60%
for the largest municipality (Lisbon).

CONCLUSIONS

Human mobility sets the stage for global spreading
phenomena [19, 27, 29, 33, 34]. Across the world, the
most relevant non-pharmacological interventions to contain the spreading of the coronavirus have been related
to closing borders and restricting the intra- and intercountry mobility, which has affected the mobility patterns [9]. Here, we studied the impact of such mobility restrictions in the inter-municipality flow of people

in Portugal, in March and April of 2020. From a large
dataset of mobile phone users, we obtained the origin–
destination matrix and the shortest–path trees from all
municipalities. These trees represent the most probable paths for the spreading of the virus, when starting
from a given municipality [24, 29, 35]. We find that the
relative decrease in mobility correlates with the population size of a municipality. For small municipalities, with
less than 18000 mobile users, the outflow is decreased by
about 10 − 20%, regardless the size of the municipality.
However, for larger municipalities, the relative decrease
in the outflow depend strongly on the population size
and it even exceeds 60% for the largest municipalities.
Such a heterogeneous change in mobility affects deeply
the structure of the shortest–path trees and, therefore,
the relative effective distance between municipalities.
To circumvent the absence of accurate data for mobility, models have been developed to artificially generate them, as for example the gravity and radiation models [32, 36], or to account for mobility restrictions in the
models [28, 37, 38]. From our findings, it is now possible
to extend these models to account for the dependence
on the size and mobility of a municipality. This heterogeneous response is an important ingredient to consider in epidemic models, such as the ones developed in
Refs. [28, 37–45], so that governments can respond to the
spread more accurately.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Mobility matrix from mobile phones records

The mobile data was obtained from NOS cellular network and its volume goes up to about 8 Terabytes
of events, collected from the network interfaces in
March and April 2020. Each record in the dataset
refers to a unique subscriber id, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliant regarding Personal
Identifiable Information (PII) [46], and it includes the
date/timestamp of each respective event and the geographic coordinates of the respective network cell coverage centroid where each event occurred. Such dataset
can thus provide an abstraction of subscriber physical
displacements over time.
The process to compute the mobility matrices is composed of several steps: from data event aggregation and
location estimation to trip count aggregation. Within the
data event aggregation part, the events are aggregated
in a 10 minutes sliding window with detection counts
for each subscriber id performed by cell. The location
for each subscriber id is estimated based on the most
frequent cell algorithm. Once the location trips are extracted, the process to derive origin–destination flows
between geographic areas is the following: i. The geographic area under analysis is divided into municipalities;
ii. Origin and destination municipalities, together with
starting time are extracted for each subscriber id. iii.

6
Trips with the same origin, destination, and time frame
are grouped together. The result is a matrix whose element represents the number of trips from origin i to
destination j, starting within the time frame. Here, we
used the municipal areas in Portugal for the regions and
the time frame of 6 am and 8 pm.
From the mobility matrix, the extrapolation process is
carried out to represent the whole universe of the population in study. The extrapolation algorithm takes into
consideration local as well as international market shares,
besides wholesale agreements between parties. After extrapolation, the transformation process takes place to extract features from residents and non–residents, segmenting the data between flows from region i to j, and the
ones that do not move within that time window, which is
the same as saying that i is equal to j. At the end, compliance with the data privacy rules (GDPR) are applied
and trips with counts under 6 are omitted.

at both municipality i and j within the day d. In order to
measure the combined number of individuals from i to j,
we considered the undirected mobility network using the
standard symmetrization operation F = F + FT , where
FT is the transposed matrix of F [29].
Each element of the origin–destination
matrix P is calP
culated as Pij = Fij / n Fin , where the sum is over
all municipalities, and quantifies the mobility network,
where the nodes are the municipalities and the edges between i and j have a weight Pij . If we define the distance
`ij = 1 − log(Pij ) for each edge, the most probable paths
are the ones that minimize the total sum of ` [29]. For
each node, one can define a shortest–path tree (see Fig. 2)
and the effective distance Deff from a node i to j as the
length of the shortest path between these two nodes.
