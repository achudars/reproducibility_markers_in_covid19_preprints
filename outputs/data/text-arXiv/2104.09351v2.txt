Abstract:
In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic spreads all over the world. In order to alleviate the spread of the
epidemic, various blockade policies have been implemented in many areas. This has led to sluggish
demand in the world’s major economies, a sharp drop in trade index, and negative growth in energy
consumption. Comparing with large comprehensive cities or countries, the unique economy structure
of Macao makes it a typical case of analysing the energy consumption of the commercial tourism cities
during the epidemic period. In order to formulate a better epidemic prevention policy for urban energy
consumption of the commercial tourism cities, this paper first summarised the major statistics of
energy supply and demands in Macao before and during the epidemic period based on actual data.
Then, the characteristics of the energy consumption in different sectors of Macao, including hotel,
transportation, tourism culture and public utilities, are analysed in detail. Finally, the energy
consumption features of commercial tourism cities represented by Macao are compared with other
typical countries/regions (e.g. Italy, the United States, Japan and Brazil). These analyses demonstrate
the impact of the COVID-19 on energy consumption in commercial tourism cities, which provide
insights for the government or energy providers to formulate their policies to adapt to this pandemic.

1. Introduction
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has widely affected more than 200 countries
and regions. By the end of 2020, more than 1.8 million people died [1]. COVID-19 has strong
infectivity and long incubation period, resulting in the exponential growth and waveform expansion
of the epidemic. To contain the spread of the virus, many countries and regions have adopted
unprecedented quarantine measures, including closing cities, suspending work, forbidding gathering,
working and studying from home etc., which changed the way of human life and production [2]. From
the perspective of energy, transportation has a major impact on energy [3-4]. The strict border
management and restrictions on going abroad implemented by countries all over the world have made
air transportation suffer from significant economic depression [5]. It is predicted that the passenger
volume will reduce by 861 million to 1292 million person-times in 2020 [6], which will seriously
affect the energy consumption characteristics of cities. With the rapid emergence of virtual commerce,
education and social networking platforms, the COVID-19 pandemic has also brought about
significant digital transformation. Various uncertainties brought about by the epidemic situation have
stimulated further exploration of future technologies, and significantly increased the combination and
innovation of various industries and AI technologies in the future [7].
Interestingly, due to the reduction of most energy demand and global economic activities, the
global environment has been evidently improved in the short term [8]. The reduction of population
mobility and industrial production has greatly reduced air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions [9],
resulting in the highest reduction of carbon emissions in the past decade [10]. The COVID-19
pandemic has a tremendous impact on the short-term social economic development and people’s life,
further limiting the consumption demand and the export trade dominated by manufacturing industry
[11-12]. Such impacts have resulted in the reduction of electricity demand and brought unprecedented
challenges to the power industry that plays a supporting role in the development of human society.
To retard the spread of the epidemic, city closure policy was implemented, which changed the
structure of energy demand during the epidemic period. On the one hand, as most factories and
enterprises are shut down, the decline of industrial and commercial demand have made the overall
energy demand of all parts of the world present a significant downward trend [13-14]. On the other
hand, due to the implementation of policies such as restrictions of going out, many regions began to
implement measures such as work-from-home and remote study, thereby the residential energy
consumption increased significantly [15]. The change of energy consumption structure features
reshaped the load curves correspondingly. Affected by the epidemic and travelling restriction policy,
people’s lifestyles and social modes have changed greatly. For example, the proportions of remote
2

working and information sharing in human life are continuously increasing. The way of working from
home makes people’s time distribution of energy use more flexible, which causes a time swift in the
peak-valley curve [16]. As the peak period of energy consumption moves back as a whole, the load
peak-valley difference between working days and rest days also decreases.
With the change of energy demand structure, the energy structure in supply side also changed
during the epidemic period. Affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall demand for electricity
has declined, resulting in the reduction of thermal power generation and the uptrend of multiple
distributed renewable energy generation in many regions [17-18]. These trends also reflect the urgent
need of exploring various cutting-edge technologies of renewable energy, smart grid and efficient
energy storage [19]. Due to the strong intermittence and volatility of the renewable energy [20], the
increase of the renewable energy utilization during the epidemic period will inevitably pose more
challenges to power system operation [21]. In addition, the changing characteristics of energy demands
also lead to the increase of the randomness and uncertainty, which make load forecasting more
challenging than that in the past. As a result, economic and secure planning and operation of multienergy systems now face more challenges [22].
At the same time, affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, public utilities and enterprises face with
two major problems. 1) Income shrinkage and cash loss caused by reduced demand and falling prices
[23]. 2) Increasing cost of maintaining the normal operation of the power system under such special
circumstances [24]. Moreover, due to the problems of reduced demand and supply chain termination,
many state-investigated energy projects and plans for new facilities and infrastructure are delayed or
shelved, such as India’s renewable energy project [25] and the US capacity expansion plan [26].
Meanwhile, various bans have played a positive role in reducing urban carbon emissions and
improving the environment. However, it is unsustainable and impractical to mitigate climate change
by reducing human activities. A more effective way is the implementation of the clean transformation
of energy type [27]. Therefore, it is essential to have a deeper understanding of the changing trend of
power energy industry during the epidemic period and analyse the new trend of energy development
in the future, which can response to climate change requirements, sustainable development and energy
transformation needs of various countries.
For commercial tourism cities, whose energy sources usually rely on the purchase from adjacent
areas, the COVID-19 outbreak’ impacts have higher complexity due to the uniqueness of the economic
structure. A better understanding of the energy consumption of the commercial tourism cities such as
Macao under the epidemic is of great significance and can provide a reference for policy makers to
formulate better policies. Based on the evolution trend, prevention and control efforts, and the
3

resumption of work, this paper analyses the energy consumption of Macao during the epidemic period.
First, it gives a macroscopic analysis of the overall situation of the impact of COVID-19 on Macao’s
energy, and then analyses the overall situation of the new energy consumption characteristics, and
conducts a detailed analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in different industries of Macao
(such as hotels, cultural events, economic events, etc.). Then, the detailed comparison of Macao’s
energy characteristics with four large comprehensive countries’ energy characteristics (Italy, the
United States, Japan and Brazil) is performed, which shows the unique characteristics of Macao’s
energy consumption during the epidemic period. Based on the results of the analysis of energy
utilization characteristics, it provides a better reference for the subsequent development of better
epidemic control measures and recovery work in commercial tourism cities like Macau.
2. Macro Analysis of COVID-19’s Influence on Macao’s Energy Consumption
The epidemic prevention and control strategies, energy consumption adjustments and fluctuations
in various industries have brought challenges to Macao’s energy industry. The demand and supply
structure of power and natural gas, power generation and discharge of power plants, and integrated
energy services are directly or indirectly affected. According to Macao government’s database, the
main performance and changing trend of its energy industry were analyzed.
2.1. Electricity Demand and Supply
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the closure of most sectors of industry, commerce and
tourism has reduced the total power consumption in Macao by 7% year-on-year. Fig. 1 shows the
power consumption trend in Macao. As a special administrative region of China, Macao’s power
supply mainly comes from Mainland China [28]. In addition, the local power generation includes waste
incineration centre, natural gas, fuel oil and photovoltaic power generation. The decline in overall
energy consumption during the epidemic period has led to a 7% drop in electricity purchases from
Mainland China. However, due to the rise in power generation using natural gas, the electricity
production of local power plants increased by 3%. In addition, Macao’s total electricity consumption
in the first quarter of 2020 decreased by 20% quarter-on-quarter, with 95.6% of the electricity
purchased from Mainland China. Electricity generated by local power plants dropped by 95%,
including 62.7% from natural gas and 37.3% from fuel oil. Meanwhile, waste incineration centres and
photovoltaic power generation dropped by 24% and 25%, respectively.

2.2. Natural Gas Demand and Supply
The overall energy consumption characteristics of natural gas is shown in Fig. 2. In the first
quarter of 2020, Macao imported 7.43 million m3 of natural gas, decreased by 88% quarter-on-quarter
while increased by 13% year-on-year. In the same quarter, 7.45 million m3 of natural gas was
consumed, of which 46.7% was used for power generation and 53.3% was used for urban gas supply.
Macao’ unique geographical environment has made the tourism service industry, which is the lifeline
of the city’s economy, vigorously developed [29]. During the epidemic period, the restriction of
tourism caused a huge loss of passenger flow in Macao, which significantly reduced the energy
consumption of tourism service. In contrast, home office and remote teaching policy have increased
the energy demand in residential areas. Fig. 3 shows the consumption characteristics of natural gas
used for urban gas supply. In the first quarter of 2020, the gas consumption of Macao’s urban pipeline
network decreased by 25% quarter-on-quarter, of which the sales of business and services account for
89.1%. Residential gas supplied by gas facility operators accounted for 9.8% and public welfare gas
accounted for 1.2%. Compared to the same quarter last year, the overall consumption dropped by 25%.
The data of the natural gas consumption of several commercial, tourism-related customers was
collected, including one restaurant and six hotels, to analyze the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on the
tourism industry. The 99th percentiles of natural gas load consumption of each customer, from Jan
2018 to July 2020, are calculated, which filter out the abnormal peaks caused by drift and can be
regarded as the corresponding customer’s maximum simultaneous natural gas load. Then, the
coincidence factors (CFs) of each customer defined by the ratio of each customer’s maximum
5

simultaneous natural gas load to the total installed natural gas load capacity are also calculated, as
shown in Table. I. The kernel density estimations of the data in year 2018, 2019 and 2020, which
visualizes the distribution of the natural gas load consumption of the two types of customers (restaurant

Fig. 3 The consumption characteristic of natural gas used for urban gas supply

As implied by the 99th percentiles and CFs in Table I, in most of the using scenarios, the actual
natural gas load is usually far below the installed natural gas load capacity for each customer. The CF
of the restaurant is below 0.5 and the CFs of the hotels are all below 0.24 in 2018 to 2020. As shown
in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b), the gas load levels and CFs of the restaurant and the hotels in 2020 is
obviously lower than the ones in 2018 and 2019, resulting in a higher peak at the low load value area.
This reduction implies that during the epidemic period, the business of the tourism is bleak. Since the
gas load have reduced under the COVID-19 epidemic, the capacity of the current distribution system
6

has the potential to serve more need of commercial customers in the future. Instead of upgrading the
system in terms of supply capacity, the gas suppliers could invest more on the maintenance and
intellectualization of the system.

2.3. Power Generation and Discharge of Power Plant
During the epidemic period, the unique energy consumption characteristics and fluctuating loads
have caused a certain degree of change in Macao’s overall energy supply structure. The shutdown of
most factories and traffic restrictions greatly reduced the emission of various pollutants. The first
outstanding performance was the significant decrease of greenhouse gas emissions, which is shown in
Fig. 5. In the first quarter of 2020, the carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions from
power plants in Macao were reduced by 75% and 43%, respectively. The discharge of biochemical
oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand and suspended solids in wastewater was evidently reduced.
Although the COVID-19 pandemic caused the reduction of urban emissions and effectively improved
the environment, this was achieved on the basis of restricting human economic activities and hindering
social development, which is unsustainable. In the future, what is really conducive to environmental
development is to accelerate the transformation of energy structure and technological innovation.

2.4. Average Cost of Electricity
Macao’s average electricity costs in the first and last seasons of 2019 and first season of 2020 as
shown in Fig. 6. As can be seen from the figure, the cost of electricity purchased in Macao in the first
quarter of 2020 has dropped by 4% compared to the first and forth quarters of 2019. The cost of power
generation from oil and natural gas increased by 46% compared to the fourth quarter in 2019. In
addition, the cost of power generation from oil and natural gas in Macao increased by 35% and 28%
year-on-year respectively. Although the cost of electricity generation from oil and natural gas has
increased by a large proportion, most electricity in Macao comes from the purchase of Mainland.
Therefore, the overall average cost of electricity in Macao in the first quarter of 2020 reduced by 2%
quarter-on-quarter and 3% year-on-year.

In the short term, the sluggish tourism industry during the epidemic has seriously affected
Macao’s overall energy consumption. Some office workers carried out the strategy of working from
home, which has led to an increase in residential electricity consumption, while industrial, commercial
and government agencies’ energy consumption dramatically droped. Fig. 7 reflects the overall
electricity sales trend in Macao. By the end of March, there were 268322 electricity customers in
Macao, of which residential and commercial customers accounted for 86.6% and 11.0%, respectively.
The overall electricity sales in the first quarter of 2020 decreased by 18% compared with the previous
quarter, of which commercial users decreased significantly by 22%, residential users decreased by 2%,
and government agencies and industry users decreased by 21% and 18%, respectively. In addition,
comparing with the same quarter last year, the overall electricity sales fell by 7%, resulting from the
decrease of consumption of all users except residential users.

3. Impact of COVID-19 on Energy Consumption in Different Fields of Macao
From the end of January 2020, the government in Macao started to pose restriction on commercial
events, especially lottery industry. On January 27th, people who have travelled to Hubei province in
the last 14 days are confined to enter casinos, which is recognized as the start of lockdown in policy
aspect. The government furtherly closed most of the indoor entertainment venues on February 4th,
including all the casinos, cinemas, game-centres et al. This strict lockdown measure caused an obvious
drop in the electricity demand of relative industries. Such restriction measures were gradually removed
in late February and March, due to the government’s quick response and control to the COVID-19
pandemic. The industries began to reopen from then on. But in April the reviving of economy is
interrupted because of the second outbreak of the epidemic caused by the imported cases. This section
adopts the anonymous smart meter data collected by the electricity utility company, i.e., Companhia
9

de Electricidade de Macau (CEM), to investigate the detailed implication of COVID-19 for electricity
demand in different industries. It is worth noting that only part of the electricity consumed were
recorded by the smart meters. Thus, in this paper, we mainly focus on the difference of electricity
consumption between 2019 and 2020 and the overall trend observed. The discussion about the
numerical amount is not included.

Fig. 11 Daily electricity consumption distribution of different sectors, from 27th Jan to 9th Feb in 2019 and 2020

3.1. Energy Consumption Characteristic of Hotels
As it is shown in Fig. 8(a), in 2020, the electricity demand of Hotels (mainly contributed by
Casino Hotels) shows a significant decline in the end of January, which is distinctly different from the
slow-growing trend observed in 2019. Such decline starts at January 24th, right after the citywide
lockdown was announced in Wuhan, and the electricity consumption continues to drop after restriction
on entering casinos was implemented by the local government. the influence of the second breakout is
also reflected in Fig. 8(a), where the blue line dives in early April. In the end of May 2020, the
11

electricity demand recovered to a relatively high level. The distribution of electricity demand in Fig 9
(a) implies that the expectation of the electricity demand in 2020 is lower than it is in 2019, while the
variances are similar. As shown in Fig. 10 (a), after January 27th when the restriction was announced,
although the shape of average load curve was similar, the peak load from 10:00 a.m. to 10 p.m. dropped
by around 15%, leading to a significant reduction in total electricity consumption. This is also implied
by the distribution of daily electricity demand in Fig 11 (a), where the peaks of the ridgelines of 2020
move to the left after restriction announced. Furthermore, the load curve was flattened during the
restriction, which is shown by Fig 10 (a) and Fig 11 (a), indicating lower stress during peak hours.
3.2. Energy Consumption Characteristics of Cultural Events
Significant reduction in electricity demand from late January is also seen in the cultural events,
which consists of education, scientific and recreational activities. In order to prevent people from
gathering, the development of remote teaching and online entertainment activities kept the electricity
demand at a relatively low level for about three months. After the schools started to reopen from May
4th, the electricity demand grows gradually and exceeds the level before COVID-19 pandemic. Fig. 8
(b) shows that the electricity demand in the first few days in May 2020 is remarkably higher than it
was in 2019, resulting from the cancellation of the Labour Day holiday and the preliminary preparation
for reopening the campus. As shown in Fig. 9 (b), in 2020 the expectation and the variance of electricity
both decreased because of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. After the restriction was
announced, the daily peak demand of cultural events reduced by more than 20%, thus flattened the
load curve. As indicated by Fig. 8 (b) and Fig. 10 (b), the electricity consumption in late January in
2020 was lower than it was in 2019 before the outbreak of the pandemic, mainly due to the earlier
advent of Spring Festival in 2020, thus the impact of the implementation of restriction measures on
energy consumption in cultural events is less obvious that it is in hotels. The ridgelines in Fig. 11 (b),
which show the variance of the distribution of hourly electricity consumption, narrowed both in 2019
and in 2020, indicating the implication of the Spring Festival. However, the demand level in 2020 was
lower than 2019, which reflects the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic.
3.3. Energy Consumption Characteristics of Industry
The electricity consumption of the industry is not obviously influenced by the pandemic, since
the difference between 2019 and 2020 is not as large as shown in other fields. In Fig. 8(c), the demands
show an markable decrease in late January, resulting from the Chinese traditional holiday, the Spring
Festival in 4 Feb 2019 and 24 Jan 2020. However, in 2019, a rising trend appeared soon after the
Spring Festival, while the electricity consumption remained low in 2020. The electricity demand
12

recovered to the original level from March, but the demand in 2020 was a bit lower than it was in 2019.
According to Fig. 9 (c), the maximum demand in 2020 is a little lower than it was in 2019, whereas
the minimum demand remains at the same level. However, due to the outbreak of the pandemic, the
electricity demand in 2020 concentrate on a lower level than 2019, indicating the decrease in peak
demand. As suggested in Fig. 10 (c), a reduction in electricity consumption was observed after the
restriction was announced, while the depression of overall demand level in the following two weeks
was dominated by the Spring Festival.
3.4. Energy Consumption Characteristics of Economic Events
The economic events include the commercial buildings and activities, bank operations and trade.
Decrease in electricity demand in 2020 is observed in the two times of breakout of COVID-19, in the
end of January and the beginning of April, respectively. The reduction of electricity demand was
observed before the announcement of restriction measures, which can be explained by the spontaneous
behaviour of the publics to avoid gathering in commercial buildings and banks. The influence of the
cancellation of the Labour Day holiday on the energy reviving process in May can also be observed in
Fig. 8 (d). Despite this, the overall electricity consumption level in 2020 is similar to what it was in
2019, resulting in the similarity of electricity demand distribution in Fig. 9 (d). However, the impact
of the restriction is obvious in the two weeks after its implementation. The demand in the peak hours
reduced by around 30%, while the off-peak demand remained at the same level, as shown in Fig. 10
(d) and Fig. 11 (d).
3.5. Energy Consumption Characteristics of Administration
The electricity consumption of the public administration shows an obvious decrease in late
January. The servants in the government followed strict work-from-home policy when the pandemic
broke out, and different from the employees who take turns to go to their office in order to minimize
the number of people gathering in the working space. Hence the difference between the electricity
demands of 2019 and 2020 remains large from January to May. Gradually recovered from the
beginning of May 2020, the electricity demand exceeded the level in 2019 in the middle of May and
remained in the same level in the following days, resulting from the cancellation of the Labour Day
holiday. The continuous depression of electricity consumption is also reflected by Fig. 9 (e), which
shows that the expectation of the electricity demand in 2020 is lower than in 2019. The demand level
decreased after the implementation of restriction and work-from-home policy, while the load curves
of two years are in the same shape, indicating that although there are less staff working in the office,
the basic load pattern was not changed by those policies, as shown in Fig. 10 (e) and Fig. 11 (e).
13

3.6. Energy Consumption Characteristics of Transportation
In the beginning of 2020, the electricity consumed by transportation was remarkably higher than
the same period in 2019. Effected by the COVID-19 pandemic breakouts, substantial transportations
including flights, ships and coach were stopped, resulting in the electricity consumption-drop in the
end of January and in early April. However, since the higher level of the electricity consumption at the
beginning of 2020, the average electricity demand in 2020 slightly exceeds the level in 2019, as shown
in Fig. 9 (f). During the pandemic, people prefer to stay at home, which is consistent with the
observation in the economic sector, resulting in the decrease of electricity consumption after the
implementation of restriction, as shown in Fig. 10 (f) and Fig. 11 (f). This can also explain why the
electricity demand in 2020 does not show the uptrend as it did in 2019.
3.7. Energy Consumption Characteristic of General Residence
Different from other fields, a significant increase of electricity consumption can be observed in the
residential buildings after the first pandemic breakout in late January. As shown in Fig. 8 (g)~(i),
electricity consumption reductions are found in stairs/elevators and electrical vehicle charging of
residential buildings, which are also evidences of the stay-in-home tendency after the restriction
measures were announced. This is also supported by Fig. 9 (g), Fig. 10 (g)~(i) and Fig. 11 (g), which
indicate that in a short period after the implementation of restriction, people tended to be staying at
home, including working-from-home and going off-duty earlier, resulting in the substantial increase
in the electricity demand all day long. However, since such tendency did not last long, the distribution
of electricity demand from January to May in 2020 is similar to the one in 2019. Such situation only
last for a relatively short period of time, since most of the companies did not apply work-from-home
policy as strict as the public administration did. Another increase in household electricity demand was
observed when the pandemic broke out again in early April. Similar trends also appear in the
stairs/elevators and electrical vehicle charging of residential buildings.
3.8. Summary of Energy Consumption Characteristic of Different Sectors
In general, after the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, the electricity consumption changes in
different ways in different sectors, indicating the varying response patterns of these sectors. Some of
the sectors, for example, the hotels and the economics, the reaction to the pandemic might appear
before local implementation of the restriction measures. For cities like Macau, which highly relies on
the tourism industry, the outbreak of pandemic in neighbouring regions will have an impact on the
industries related to tourism (e.g. hotels and commercial buildings), regardless of the local policy. This
is a spontaneous reaction by the publics to avoid getting infected. The announcement of restriction by
14

the local government will lead to a further depression on these industries, and the situation only
improves when the local restriction is relaxed and the pandemic in the adjacent regions is under control.
Additionally, since the work-from-home policy is always implemented to contain the spread of the
virus, the electricity demand in residential area is likely to increase when the pandemic breaks out. At
the same time, the electricity demand in office and transport will decrease. The periods of low demand
vary from different sectors. Although work-from-home policy was announced after the outbreak,
commercial loads and industrial loads tend to recover as soon as the pandemic is well controlled locally,
while the depression of electricity demand lasts longer in public administration. As observed in Macau,
the servants conducted remote-working for a significantly longer period than the people who work for
enterprises. Similar trend could also be found in education and other cultural events. Students are
required to take remote courses, until the pandemic is controlled both locally and in neighbouring
regions. Therefore, the electricity demand from educational institutes will be kept in a low level for
longer time than other sectors, and is the most likely one to decrease with a second pandemic outbreak.
4. The Energy Consumption Characteristics and Energy Structure of the Commercial
Tourism Cities Like Macao
4.1. Analysis of Energy Consumption Characteristics
Compare the electricity consumption data of Italy, the United States, Japan and Brazil from
January to May 2019 and 2020 [30]. It can be seen from the Fig. 12 that, affected by the COVID-19
pandemic, the implementation of the city closure policy has greatly reduced the activity of many largescale industries and commerce, tourism and service industries. As a highly developed capitalist country
of the four major European economies, Italy's electricity demand from March to May 2020 was
significantly reduced. The United States, the world's largest superpower, had a downward trend in
power demand from January to April. However, compared with April 2020, the electricity
consumption of the two countries in May showed signs of recovery. Due to factors such as land area,
population and climate, the electricity demand of the United States is not only higher than that of Italy,
but also exceeds that of itself in the same month of last year. This is due to the outbreak of the epidemic
with the continuous control of the exhibition and the gradual implementation of the plan to resume
work and production in May. Compared with 2019, Brazil, as the largest developing country in South
America, is affected by the epidemic situation. In 2020, its power demand decreased month by month
from January to May. Such reduction was alleviated in May, which indicates that Brazil's closed
epidemic control policy has been eased. However, the data shows that the change of electricity demand

15

in Japan is not obvious, which might be determined by the attitude and measures taken by the Japanese
government in the face of the epidemic.

Fig. 12 Energy consumption during epidemic in typical countries

Compared with the above analysis of Macao’s electricity consumption data, due to urban closure
and other reasons, Macao’s electricity consumption trend in the first quarter of 2020 is the same as that
of Italy, the United States and Brazil. Under the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall
energy demand showed a downward trend. With the fast control of the epidemic and the gradual
implementation of the plan to resume work and production, power demand began to rise in May. As a
city where many world-class casinos were located [31], Macao’s economy mainly relies on tourism,
gambling, light industry and foreign trade [32]. Therefore, Macao’s main energy consumption is also
centered around tourism and service industries and its commercial power consumption accounts for
64.3% of the total. As one of the most densely populated cities [33], Macao’s residential electricity
accounts for 22.3%. Compared with the above-mentioned countries led by industry, Macao’s tourism
service industry also makes the overall energy consumption change relatively gentle under the impact
of the pandemic [34]. Due to the large demand of industrial customers, the shutdown of factories during
the epidemic will bring greater impact on the energy consumption characteristics. Compared with the
large comprehensive cities, Macao’s overall energy use is unique in the following aspects:
1) The famous entertainment industry
Just like Macao’s famous gambling industry [35-36], typical commercial and tourism cities have
their own unique entertainment industries. As an important resource, power supply realizes air
conditioning, illumination and various equipment in entertainment venues. Therefore, the
entertainment industry has an important impact on the energy and power consumption characteristics
16

of commercial tourism cities. Especially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, many cities have
adopted measures such as city blockades and road closures, which have dealt a huge blow to the
entertainment industry. This has also affected the characteristics of the overall electricity consumption
of a typical commercial tourism city like Macao, where the overall electricity consumption reduced.
2) High quality hotel service industry
As a commercial tourism city, just as Macao has developed an excellent service industry due to
its unique geographical location and gaming culture [37-38], its hotel service industry as a support for
the tourism industry is also the key to attract a large number of tourists. The gorgeous hotel architecture
and high-quality internal services attract thousands of tourists every year [39]. Due to its unique
operating characteristics and the nature of residents, hotel facilities also account for a large part of the
overall power consumption of commercial tourism cities. To retard the spread of the COVID-19
pandemic, the hotel service industry has entered the rock bottom, causing the income and energy
consumption of such cities to decline [40]. Moreover, the quarantine measures during the epidemic
also made some hotels become quarantine areas, offsetting the reduction in electricity consumption.
3) Rapid development of foreign trade
As a member of the World Trade Organization, Macao maintains good trade relations with many
countries and regions, mainly including light industrial products and services trade [41]. At the same
time, with the vigorous development of tourism, the economic status of service trade in commercial
tourism cities is becoming more and more important. As a result of the spread of COVID-19 pandemic,
more than 200 countries in the world have been infected. It has a huge impact on global trade and
hindered the development of Macao’s foreign trade, and thus seriously affected Macao’s energy
consumption characteristics.
4.2. Analysis of Power Energy Structure
According to IEA data, the share of renewable energy in the power structure is still large during
COVID-19 pandemic, which does not exclude the regional seasonal climate impact. Due to the low
power demand during the epidemic period, considering the low operating cost of renewable energy
and the priority of grid access, the power structure in many countries is gradually turning to renewable
energy. Fig. 13 shows the energy structure of several typical countries during the epidemic.
In the United States, natural gas is the main source. Due to the implementation of restrictive
measures, renewable energy has contributed far more to electricity than coal-fired power plants. In
March 2020, despite the reduction of seasonal wind power generation and the easing of the severity of
government anti-epidemic measures, natural gas continues to dominate. After the implementation of
the blockade measures in India, the gap between coal and renewable energy has been significantly
17

narrowed. The coal remained below 70% of the power structure. In the end of May, power demand
gradually recovered and the share of renewable energy continued to rise. Since the end of June, with
the increase of temperature and power demand, the proportion of coal in the power structure has
increased while wind energy has been declining. Due to beneficial weather conditions and
geographical location, EU countries are abundant in renewable resources such as wind power. Their
power generation has increased significantly compared with the first quarter of 2019. Affected by the
COVID-19 pandemic, the reduction of electricity demand and the increase of renewable energy
production further deepened the decline of coal and nuclear energy demand. From June to July, the
increase of natural gas demand was second only to renewable energy. In the case of low nuclear power
production, natural gas made up for the fluctuation of wind power output every week.

Fig. 13 Energy structure of typical country

Generally speaking, a commercial tourism city like Macau is characterized by dense population
and scarce resources. It relies heavily on external resources to meet energy needs. For example, the
three major sources of electricity in Macau are local power plants, municipal solid waste incineration
power generation, and electricity imported from Mainland China [42-43]. Usually due to the unique
geographic location of such cities, renewable resources account for only a small proportion of the
energy structure. In addition, the development of the tourism service industry has also brought greater
potential for waste incineration power generation in commercial tourism cities like Macao [44].
Generally, the waste incineration power generation capacity of such economic tourism cities is higher
18

than the local natural gas and oil power generation capacity. Therefore, this is also a relatively unique
part of the energy structure of this type of cities, and it is a relatively effective method for the treatment
and utilization of much garbage in modern cities.
5. Conclusion
This paper analyzes the energy characteristics of the urban energy consumption of the commercial
tourism city under COVID-19 pandemic based on the energy supply and consumption data of Macao.
Compared with 2019, the paper expounds the overall macro trend of energy supply and consumption
in Macao. The situation of energy use in various fields in Macao during the COVID-19 pandemic
period was analyzed in detail. Compared with the energy consumption and structural characteristics of
some typical countries, the energy usage characteristics of commercial tourism cities are analyzed,
taking Macao as a representative. The main conclusion of this paper are as follows:
(a) Affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the energy supply and consumption of commercial tourism
cities represented by Macao are showing a downward trend. The energy demand of residential
users has been increasing under the influence of the blockade policy. The discharge of waste
decreased sharply in a short time, which reduced the environmental pollution.
(b) The energy consumption of hotels, cultural events, shopping malls, entertainment and other
service industries and public utilities of a typical commercial tourism city like Macao is obviously
affected by the epidemic. The electricity consumption of the industry is not obviously influenced
by the pandemic.
(c) Macao is short of resources and its energy supply is mainly rely on Mainland China. During the
new outbreak, Macao’s natural gas utilization increased. Due to the characteristics of economic
development and geographical resources, the current energy structure of most commercial tourism
cities in China is still dominated by coal and oil, and is constantly transforming to a renewable
energy structure.
