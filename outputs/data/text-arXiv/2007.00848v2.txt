A BSTRACT
The analysis of complex longitudinal data such as COVID-19 deaths is challenging due to several inherent features: (i) Similarly-shaped profiles with different decay patterns; (ii) Unexplained
variation among repeated measurements within each country, these repeated measurements may be
viewed as clustered data since they are taken on the same country at roughly the same time; (iii)
Skewness, outliers or skew-heavy-tailed noises are possibly embodied within response variables.
This article formulates a robust nonlinear mixed-effects model based in the class of scale mixtures
of skew-normal distributions for modeling COVID-19 deaths, which allows the analysts to model
such data in the presence of the above described features simultaneously. An efficient EM-type
algorithm is proposed to carry out maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters. The bootstrap method is used to determine inherent characteristics of the nonlinear individual profiles such
as confidence interval of the predicted deaths and fitted curves. The target is to model COVID-19
deaths curves from some Latin American countries since this region is the new epicenter of the disease. Moreover, since a mixed-effect framework borrows information from the population-average
effects, in our analysis we include some countries from Europe and North America that are in a more
advanced stage of their COVID-19 deaths curve.

Introduction

The world is facing a global pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Initiated at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, we are coming, on the 26th of
June of 2020, to more than 9 millions cases and 500 thousands deaths spread in 216 countries. The World Health
Organization (WHO) has made a joint effort with nations to tackle the disease. Some countries as Germany, Italy,
Spain and United Kingdom faced the peak of the disease in March 2020, and now appear to have the disease under control. In other regions such as South-East Asia and Africa it seems to be at the beginning (panel at WHO,
https://covid19.who.int/). Currently, Latin American countries are the new epicenter of the disease.
Some institutions around the world have dedicated to data collection and graphical analysis. For example, the panel
of the WHO presents graphs of the number of cases and deaths over time for regions and countries. The Johns

A PREPRINT - AUGUST 4, 2020

Hopkins University collects and makes available the daily data, besides producing maps of the occurrence by countries
(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). Another available repository is the website Worldometers
(https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).
There are many institutions in the world modeling and performing forecast of the number of cases and deaths of
COVID-19. For example, at the beginning of March 2020, an study of the Oxford University projected more than
450 thousand of deaths in Brazil (https://www.pnas.org/content/117/18/9696). Another study from
the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) projects a total of 165 thousand of
deaths (https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections). The Imperial College presented an specific
study to Brazil that estimates with high confidence that the reproduction number remained above 1, indicating that the
epidemic was not yet controlled and would continue to grow (Mellan et al., 08-05-2020). In Brazil, there are some
organizations studying the evolution of the disease over time allowing online apps with daily updates, for instance,
the Department of Statistics of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (CovidLPTeam, 2020) and the Department of
Statistics of the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (JF Salvando Todos Team, 2020).
The Americas have become the epicenter of the global coronavirus outbreak, logging nearly 4 million infections and
204, 000 deaths. Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru have been particularly hard hit in recent weeks. To point
out the possible impact of the disease in Latin America, the CovidLPTeam (2020), in June 26th , estimates a total of
more than 700 thousand deaths only for these countries until the end of the pandemic.
Some studies for modeling the COVID-19 data are based on nonlinear models. Tsallis and Tirnakli (2020) proposed a
nonlinear model based on volume of stock-markets to predict the number of active cases:
Nt =

C(t − t0 )α
,
[1 + (q − 1)β(t − t0 )γ ]1/(q−1)

where C > 0, α > 0, β > 0, γ > 0, q > 1 and t0 ≥ 0. The constant t0 indicates the first day of appearance of the
epidemic in that particular region; it is conventionally chosen to be zero for China; for other countries, it is the number
of days elapsed between the appearance of the first case in China and the first case in that country. The normalizing
constant C reflects the total population of that particular country. We refer to Tsallis and Tirnakli (2020), for more
details about the interpretation of the parameters α, β, γ, q.
The CovidLPTeam (2020) proposed an hierarchical Bayesian non-Gaussian and non-linear model to capture the dynamics of the epidemic (last accessed on the 26th of June on 2020). The daily counts are assumed to come from a
Poisson distribution and the daily pandemic evolving by a generalized logistic dynamic:

parameter, a, b and f control the asymptote of the curve, given by baf , with the peak occurring at time t = −
c
However, to the best of our knowledge, most models developed up to this date are univariate, not taking into account
a possible structure of dependence on the disease among countries or regions. Also, as the onset of the disease occurs
at different periods between countries, those at a more advanced stage of the disease can provide valuable information
to countries at an early stage.
In recent years, nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) models have been proposed for modeling many complex longitudinal
data (Lindstrom and Bates, 1990; Wu, 2010). However, one often assumes that both random error and random effects
are normally distributed, which may not always give reliable results if the data exhibit excessive skewness and heavy
tailedness, as is the case of COVID-19 deaths data. In this paper, we present a novel class of asymmetric NLME
models that provides an efficient estimation of the parameters in the analysis of longitudinal data. We assume that,
marginally, the random effects follow a scale mixtures of skew-normal distribution (SMSN, Branco and Dey, 2001)
and that the random errors follow a symmetric scale mixtures of normal distribution (SMN, Lange and Sinsheimer,
1993) providing an appealing robust alternative to the usual normal distribution in NLME models. We propose an
approximate likelihood analysis for maximum likelihood (ML) estimation via an EM-type algorithm that produces
accurate ML estimates and significantly reduces the numerical difficulty associated with the exact ML estimation.
The newly approximate procedures are applied to COVID-19 deaths data and it is showed that models with skewheavy-tailed assumption may provide more reasonable results and these may be important for COVID-19 research in
providing quantitative guidance to better understand the stages and future development of the disease.
The purpose of this study is to predict the number of deaths caused by COVID-19 to short and long term, in countries
at early stage such as Peru, Mexico, Chile, Brazil and Colombia along with some countries at a more advanced stage
2

A PREPRINT - AUGUST 4, 2020

of the disease such as Belgium, Italy, the USA and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, a general bootstrap method is
used for constructing confidence intervals for the fitted COVID-19 deaths curves and its mode (date of the peak) for
the selected countries. The method proposed in this paper is implemented in R (R Core Team, 2019), and the codes are
available for download from Github (https://github.com/fernandalschumacher/NLMECOVID19).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the motivating COVID-19 deaths datasets
obtained from the John Hopkins repository. In Section 3, we present the methodology and associated ML estimation
procedure via the EM-algorithm. In Section 4, we present our result, where we forecast the total number of deaths in
the selected countries for the short term 30 and 60 days and long term 90 and 150 days with starting point at June 25th
2020. Finally, the paper concludes with some discussions in Section 5.

Motivating COVID-19 data

The Johns Hopkins University through the Center for Systems Science and Engineering created a COVID-19 repository (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/) that is updated daily with data from many locations of the world. The repository combine data from a variety of official agencies and others reliable sources and
unify them.
Due to different testing capacity between countries, subnotification is a challenge to understand the true contamination
numbers of COVID-19 in the population. Despite that subnotification might also happen in number of deaths, they are
less likely to be affected by detection biases. In fact, recent studies use the number of deaths as a proxy measure for
COVID-19 cases (see, for example, Maugeri et al., 2020; Ribeiro and Bernardes, 2020; Amaro et al., 2020). Figure 1
shows the reported number of daily deaths in different countries.

days since first death

Figure 1: Number of daily reported deaths since first death for the nine countries considered in this study, until 24th
of June 2020, with a LOESS non-parametric estimated curve superimposed.
As it can be seen the selected countries are in different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Belgium, Italy, the United
Kingdom (UK), and the United States of America (US) present a controlled number of deaths by the disease. Other
countries like Brazil, Mexico, and Peru seem to be around their peak, while Chile and Colombia apparently are in the
increasing part of the curve. Figure 1 also presents a LOESS (Cleveland, 1979) fit and a 30 days prediction for each
3

A PREPRINT - AUGUST 4, 2020

series. Non-parametric curves are alternatives for model fitting because of their flexibility. As it can be seen, the curves
have difficulties to capture the rapid increase in deaths in some countries but overall provide a reasonable fit. However,
when using this model to make prediction we can clearly see that their extrapolation capacities are not reliable, making
necessary the usage of a more adequate statistical parametric model to capture the nature of the pandemic and provide
sensible fit and prediction.
Although that Peru moved quickly to lock down its citizens as the pandemic took hold in early March and has extended
the lockdown until the end of June 2020, cases nonetheless exploded in May, reaching a peak of more than 8, 000 cases
per day late in May, in part explained because the informal employment reaches 73% of the Peruvian labor market.
Peru has now reported 268, 602 cases and 8, 761 deaths of COVID-19 (Worldometers.info, 2020), the second-highest
number of confirmed cases of the disease in Latin America, behind Brazil, and the seventh-highest globally.
In Mexico, the accumulated COVID-19 cases reached 202, 951 and a death total of 25, 060 until June 26th . Moreover,
the statistics show that the curve is ascending (Worldometers.info, 2020). Torrealba-Rodriguez et al. (2020) presented
a modeling and prediction of accumulated cases of COVID-19 infection in Mexico using the models of Gompertz and
Logistic and a framework of Artificial Neural Network. These models predict the peak between May 8th and June
25th , which might be unrealistic as presented in Section 4.
Colombia is in an ascending stage of the curve of cases and deaths, having accumulated 80, 599 cases and 2, 654 deaths
until June, 26th according to Worldometers.info (2020). Rivera-Rodriguez and Urdinola (2020) used a SEIR model
to estimate the number of patients that would required Intensive Care Units (ICU) care (critical), and only hospital
care (severe) in order to manage their limited resources. De Castro (2020) used a SIR model to estimate the number
of cases and deaths in Colombia using data of Italy and South Korea where the peak of infections would be by June
29th . As shown in Figure 1, Colombia presents an increasing pattern and the peak should be observed somewhere in
the future.
For Chile, the statistics are of 263, 360 accumulated cases and a total of 5, 068 deaths until June 26th (Worldometers.info, 2020). It is important to observe that there are two days with observations far above the standard: number of
deaths of 649 (June 8th ) and number of cases of 36, 179 (June 18th ).
Lastly, Brazil presented 1, 244, 419 cases and 55, 304 deaths until June 26th according to Worldometers.info (2020)
and is the country with second-highest number of confirmed cases and deaths in the world. CovidLPTeam (2020)
estimates that the Brazilian peak of deaths should happen in June 06th and a estimated total number of death of
99, 932 which is closely related to the predictions presented in Section 4. From Figure 1 we can see that Brazil is the
country in more advanced stage of the evolution of the disease in the Latin American region.
The different stages of spread of the disease are an important information that should be used into modeling. In the
next section we introduce our methodology that jointly accommodates the different stages of the diseases and borrow
information of the different time series to provide a more robust and reliable fit and prediction.

3.1

The model
Scale mixtures of skew-normal distributions

The idea of the SMSN distributions originated from an early work by Branco and Dey (2001), which included the
skew-normal (SN) distribution as a special case. We say that a p × 1 random vector Y follows a SN distribution with
p × 1 location vector µ, p × p positive definite dispersion matrix Σ and p × 1 skewness parameter vector λ, (often
known as the shape parameter) and write Y ∼ SNp (µ, Σ, λ), if its probability density function (pdf) is given by
f (y) = 2φp (y; µ, Σ)Φ(λ> Σ−1/2 (y − µ)),

(2)

where φp (.; µ, Σ) stands for the pdf of the p–variate normal distribution with mean vector µ and dispersion matrix
Σ, Np (µ, Σ) say, and Φ(.) is the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the standard univariate normal. Note
for λ = 0, (2) reduces to the symmetric Np (µ, Σ)-pdf, while for non-zero values of λ, it produces a perturbed
(asymmetric) family of Np (µ, Σ)-pdf’s. Let Z = Y − µ. Since aZ ∼ SNp (0, a2 Σ, λ), for all scalar a > 0, the
SMSN family can be defined as follows: a SMSN distribution is that of a p−dimensional random vector
Y = µ + U −1/2 Z,

(3)

where U is a positive random variable with the cdf H(u; ν) and pdf h(u; ν), and independent of the SNp (0, Σ, λ)–
random vector Z. Here ν is a scalar or vector parameter indexing the distribution of the mixing scale factor U . Given
U = u, Y follows a multivariate skew–normal distribution with location vector µ, scale matrix u−1 Σ and skewness
4

A PREPRINT - AUGUST 4, 2020

parameter vector λ, i.e., Y|U = u ∼ SNp (µ, u−1 Σ, λ). Thus, by (2), the marginal pdf of Y is
Z ∞
φp (y; µ, u−1 Σ)Φ(u1/2 λ> Σ−1/2 (y − µ))dH(u; ν).
f (y) = 2

The notation Y ∼ SMSNp (µ, Σ, λ; H) will be used when Y has pdf (4). The asymmetrical class of SMSN distributions includes the skew–t (ST), the skew–slash (SSL), and the skew–contaminated normal (SCN). All these
distributions have heavier tails than the skew-normal and can be used for robust inferences. When λ = 0, the
class reduces to the scale mixtures of normal (SMN) class, which is represented by the pdf f0 (y) =

(y;
µ, u−1 Σ)dH(u; ν). We use the notation Y ∼ SMNp (µ, Σ; H) when Y has distribution in the SMN

class. We refer to Schumacher et al. (2020b) for details and additional properties related to this class of distributions.
3.2

Model formulation

In this section, we present the models and methods in general forms, illustrating that our methods may be applicable
in other applications as well. Denote the number of subjects by n and the number of measurements on the ith subject
by ni . For notational convenience, let xij (i = 1, 2, . . . , n; j = 1, 2, . . . , ni ) be a vector incorporating independent
variables such as number of ICU beds, β ij = (β1ij , . . . , βsij )> , β = (β1 , . . . , βr )> (r > s). The NLME model can
be written as
yi

=

ηi (tij , β ij ) + i , β ij = d(xij , β, bi ),

(5)

>

where the subscript i is the subject index, yi = (yi1 , . . . , yini ) , with yij being the response value for individual
i at time tij , ηi (tij , β ij ) = (η(ti1 , β i1 )> , . . . , η(tini , β ini ))> , with η(·) being a nonlinear known function,  =
(i1 , . . . , ini )> is random error vector, d(.) is an s-dimensional linear function, bi = (b1i , . . . , bqi )> is the vector of
random effects (q ≤ s).
Following Schumacher et al. (2020a), we assume that

parameters α of dimension v × 1 and λ = (λ1 , . . . , λq )> is a q × 1 vector of skewness parameters for the random
effects. Using the definition of a SMSN random vector and (6), it follows that marginally

bi ∼ SMSNq (c∆, D, λ; H) and

i ∈ {1, . . . , n},

(7)

so that E{bi } = E{i } = 0. Thus this model considers that the i ’s, related to within-subject errors are symmetrically
distributed, while the distribution of random effects is assumed to be asymmetric and with mean zero. In addition,
under this consideration the regression parameters are all comparable.
Let θ = (β > , σ 2 , α> , λ> , ν > )> , then classical inference on the parameter vector θ is based on the marginal distribution for Y = (y1> , . . . , yn> ). Thus, the integrated likelihood of (5)-(6) for θ in this case is given by

which generally does not have a closed form expression because the model function is not linear in the random effects.
In the normal case, to make the numerical optimization of the likelihood function in a tractable problem, different
approximations to (8) have been proposed. Some of these methods consist of taking a first-order Taylor expansion of
the model function around the conditional models of the random effects b (Lindstrom and Bates, 1990). Following
this idea, the marginal distribution of Yi , for i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, can be approximated as

Approximate ML estimation via the EM algorithm

In this section, we demonstrate how to use the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977) to obtain approximate maximum

likelihood (ML) estimator of a SMSN–NLME model. We denote the current estimates of (β, bi ) by (β,

algorithm for iteratively computing ML estimates of the parameters in the SMSN-LME model has been proposed and
for which we use the skewlmm package in R (Schumacher et al., 2020c; R Core Team, 2019). The approximated
likelihood function, derived from (9), can be easily computed as a byproduct of the EM-algorithm and is used for
monitoring convergence and for model selection, such as, the Akaike (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
(Wit et al., 2012).

Confidence intervals via Bootstrap

Bootstrap methods are statistical tools used in many statistical problems such as calculus of bias, variance, confidence
intervals, sampling distributions of the estimators, among others. For technical details, we refer to Efron and Hastie
(2016). In this paper, we use the parametric Bootstrap to calculate a confidence interval for the mode (date of the peak)
of COVID-19 deaths by country. Also, we construct confidence bands to the estimated COVID-19 deaths curve along
the time. We generate M random samples of length n of the model (eq. 5–6) using the estimated parameters and for
b t ).
each random sample, we fit the proposed model and calculate the statistical mode, the fitted and predicted curve (Y
b
b
So, for each country, we will have M o1 , ..., M oM estimates of the mode and Yt1 , ..., YtM . We calculate the percentiles
α/2 and 1 − α/2 to construct a confidence interval of level α for the mode and for the fitted curve of the COVID-19
deaths. In this notes, we use α = 5%.
To propose the confidence interval for the peak of deaths, we select the two dates such that the 97.5% percentile curve
coincides with the highest value of the 2.5% percentile curve. Thus, we guarantee that all curves belonging to the
confidence band will peak within this interval.

Data analysis

In order to analyse the COVID-19 data described in Section 2, we propose to fit the SMSN-NLME model given in (5)
with the derivative of the generalized logistic model as nonlinear function, which can be written as follows:
α1 α3i α4 exp{−α3i tij }
,
(13)
η(tij , β ij ) =
(α2i + exp{−α3i tij })α4 +1
where α2i = exp{β2 + b2i }, α3i = exp{β3 + b3i }, and αk = exp{βk }, for k = 1, 4, with the exponential transformation being used to ensure positiveness of the parameters. Note that this function is similar to the one considered in
the univariate approach of CovidLPTeam (2020), as presented in (1), except that in (13) random effects are included
to enable a multivariate approach and borrow information between the different time series.
For numerical stability, we use the linear transformation yij = zij /kz , where zij is the number of registered deaths
at the ith country and jth day since first death, and kz = 33.944 is chosen to be the sample standard deviation from
the Colombia data, which is the smaller one in the observed data. For model selection, we consider AIC and BIC, as
described in Section 3.3, for distributions normal (N), skew-normal (SN), student’s-t (t), and skew-t (ST). As shown
in Table 1, the distribution with lowest AIC and BIC is the ST, which will be used in the analysis hereafter. It is worth
noting that the fitted ST distribution has ν = 1.568 (Table 2), evidencing the need for heavy tail models.

To obtain long term evolution estimates, we computed the 300-days-ahead prediction for all countries considered in
this study. Figure 2 presents the fitted model, along with the prediction, the real data and confidence intervals information. To preserve the individual properties observed for each country, the random error was generated conditioned on
b yi }, i = 1, . . . , 9, which is estimated as a byproduct of the EM algorithm and
the mixing scale factor u
bi = E{Ui | θ,
is responsible to preserve the observed characteristics of the series for each country. Additionally, the 95% confidence
intervals were obtained as described in Subsection 3.5, where M = 600 samples were generated, from which the
model estimate or prediction for 13 samples resulted in numerical error and/or non-convergence. For the 587 remaining samples we performed a 15% trim of the series to remove those noise series that were not able to replicate the
characteristics of the data. To identify such series we used as metric the mean square error (MSE) between the fitted
values and observed data and removed those such that the MSE have the highest values. This procedure was performed
to prevent convergence problems to affect the interval estimates, resulting in a final of 499 samples.

Figure 2: Fitted and predicted curve for the ST-NLME model (blue line), along with real data (black), and bootstrap
95% interval estimates for the curve (shaded blue area) and for the peak (shaded grey area), for each country.
From Figure 2, we can see that for countries in more advanced stage of the evolution of COVID-19, the confidence
intervals are narrow. On the other hand, for countries in early stage such as Chile and Colombia, the uncertainty
regarding the disease evolution is much bigger, which is reflected by the wider confidence intervals and very vague
information about the peak.
Table 3 reports predictions for the total number of deaths for each country and up to 30, 60, 90, and 150-days-ahead of
the date from the latest observation considered (2020-06-24), using the fitted ST-NLME model (our selected model),
along with its 95% confidence interval, obtained from the bootstrap results. As can be seen, based on the observed
data, the European countries and the US have the deaths by COVID-19 practically controlled, since the death estimates
are stable in all future prediction times. Brazil, Mexico and Peru are around its peak (Figure 3). Their prediction mildly
increase with time and they present a little more imprecision as observed by their 95% confidence interval estimates if
compared to the controlled countries. Finally, Chile and Colombia seem to be in the increasing phase. The predicted
number of deaths changes drastically between the time intervals with a wide uncertainty.
Table 4 shows the total estimated number of deaths at the end of the pandemic and the estimated peak date by each
country. This results corroborates and reinforce the analysis presented in the previous paragraph. Moreover, Table 4
presents the estimates of the parameters of the logistic dynamic of the model. As it can be seen, α̂4  1 showing
a large right skewness for the pandemic dynamics. In other words, the increase phase occurs much faster than the
decrease phase as observed in many places. This is a clear effect of borrowing strength from curves in different stages.
For example, for the curves from the Latin American countries, where observations are mainly on the left side of the

This article proposes a robust modeling of COVID-19 deaths based on a NLME model, where the Gaussian distribution
of the random terms are replaced by the SMSN class of distributions. We believe that the proposed methods may
have a significant impact on COVID-19 research because, in the presence of skewness and heavy tails in the data,
appropriate statistical inference for COVID-19 research can lead to more accurate and reliable clinical decisions,
in addition, our model can be useful to guide some policies that need to be taken by the selected Latin American
governments in order to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt
in working on such general distributional structure related to COVID-19 deaths data. Our proposed method is quite
general and is not limited to the analysis of the selected countries and reported deaths, thus we have made the R codes
available for download from Github (https://github.com/fernandalschumacher/NLMECOVID19),

which will encourage other researchers to use NLME models and the SMSN class of distributions in their studies of
other characteristics of COVID-19 data.
Understanding the dynamics of the pandemic and being able to predict its future behavior is of extreme importance.
While many countries and consortia try to create an effective vaccine for the disease, the best current alternative is
to flatten the contamination curve to guarantee that the health systems are able to provide the necessary care for the
population without being overwhelmed. With the use of countries that have controlled the pandemic number of deaths
we strongly believe that our methodology can provide more reliable and meaningful prediction that allow policies
makers in Latin America to make effective decisions.
Extension of the presented methodology to the number of cases can also be performed, however, because of the large
subnotification in the data and due to the different testing capability among countries, this approach is challenging.
A possible alternative to overcome this fact is to incorporate into modeling time changing covariates that adequately
capture the subnotification dynamics of each country. Another interesting future development and work is to model the
cases and deaths by COVID-19 jointly since these series are necessarily correlated. Moreover, the WHO has warned
that the coronavirus may never go away and concerns are growing about a second (perhaps a third) wave of infections.
Thus, a natural generalization of our method is to consider a finite mixture of SMSN-NLME models (Lachos et al.,
2017; Zeller et al., 2019). An in-depth investigation of such extensions are beyond the scope of the present paper, but
certainly an interesting topic for (near) future research.
