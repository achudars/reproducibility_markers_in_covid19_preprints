GUARANTEED NON-EXCEEDING ICU CAPACITY∗

Abstract. In this paper we investigate feedback control techniques for the COVID-19 pandemic which
are able to guarantee that the capacity of available intensive care unit beds is not exceeded. The control
signal models the social distancing policies enacted by the local government. We propose a control design
based on the bang-bang funnel controller which is robust with respect to uncertainties in the parameters of
the epidemiological model and only requires measurements of the number of individuals who require medical
attention. Therefore, it may serve as a first step towards a reliable decision making mechanism. Simulations
illustrate the efficiency of the proposed controller.

1. Introduction. One of the most difficult problems in forecasting the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic is to generate reliable signals for policy makers in the presence of
uncertain data and model parameters. To resolve this, in the present work a robust approach
is taken, which is able to generate reliable signals for social distancing measures (or against
them) in the presence of uncertainties in the parameters of the epidemiological model and
which requires only measurements of the number of COVID-19 patients showing moderate to
severe symptoms (and independent of possibly asymptomatic infected or patients with mild
symptoms). The number of those symptomatic infected, who require medical attention, can
typically be measured accurately – under the assumption that sufficient testing capabilities
are available.
It is well documented [8, 12] that social distancing measures help to reduce infection rates
and have an effect on the containment of the spread of SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand,
social distancing has negative effects on both the economy and the mental and emotional
health of the population. Therefore, policy makers face the hard decision of when to enact
social distancing and when to relax the measures. The present paper may serve to provide
a decision making mechanism based on a robust feedback control design.
In contrast to model-based techniques such as MPC (model-predictive control) used
in [5, 9, 13] for instance, in the present paper we use a control methodology which does not
require a specific model and is robust with respect to uncertainties in the system parameters.
Because of the latter, it is not necessary to precisely identify all parameters such as the
infection, recovery or death rates. Therefore, the approach may allow for an easier scalability,
i.e., it may be applicable to different countries or regions or cities, without the need to
precisely (re-)identify all the parameters for this region.
The above described question of when to enact social distancing measures or even a
lockdown is a typical control theoretic question. Modelling this question utilizing a control
input which takes only a finite number of different values, as suggested e.g. in [9], a suitable
feedback controller is able to generate the required signals. In the present work we consider
the simple case of a binary control input, i.e., with values in {0, 1}. To this end, we combine
a widely used model for the description of the COVID-19 pandemic from [14] with a control
component proposed in [13]. The latter adds additional dynamics to the model which
account for the effects of social distancing policies represented by the value of the control
input and the response of the population to them (paying heed to possible delays).
The control objective is to keep the number of infected with moderate to severe symp∗ Preprint

toms (which typically require hospitalization) below a threshold defined by the number of
available ICU (intensive care unit) beds. Another approach discussing control strategies
which are able to bound the hospitalized population, by using control barrier functions, can
be found in [1]. In the present paper, to achieve the control objective we exploit the bangbang funnel controller developed in [11], which is able to guarantee error margins in tracking
problems and the control input switches between only two values. Funnel control proved
an appropriate tool in several applications such as temperature control of chemical reactor
models [7], control of industrial servo-systems [6] and underactuated multibody systems [2],
voltage and current control of electrical circuits [4], DC-link power flow control [15] and
adaptive cruise control [3].
2. Epidemiological model for the COVID-19 pandemic and system class.
2.1. Dynamics of the pandemic. We use a so called SIRASD (Susceptible-InfectedRecovered-Asymptomatic-Symptomatic-Deceased) model for the dynamics of the COVID19 pandemic from [13], which is able to account for possible social distancing policies. The
resulting epidemiological model has the following dynamics:
S(t)

N − D(t)

with the gain function
(2.2)

Kψ (t) = 1 − γK

αA ρ IA (t)
.
1 − ρ N − D(t)

In (2.1) the total population of a considered region is split into the following compartments:
• susceptible individuals S(t),
• infected but asymptomatic individuals IA (t),
• infected and symptomatic individuals IS (t),
• recovered individuals R(t),
• deceased individuals D(t) (due to the disease).
It is easily seen that the derivative of the sum of the above quantities is zero,

d
dt S(t) + IA (t) + IS (t) + R(t) + D(t) = 0
for all t ≥ 0, thus it stays constant over time and we may define the initial population
(assuming D(0) = 0) by
N := S(0) + IA (0) + IS (0) + R(0) = S(t) + IA (t) + IS (t) + R(t) + D(t),

t ≥ 0.

The other parameters used in (2.1) are summarized in Table 2.1 and we emphasize that
αA , αS , βA , βS , ρ, p, γ0 , γ1 , ψ̄ ∈ [0, 1].
2.2. Population response. The last equation in (2.1) models the dynamics of social
distancing policies and contains additional parameters to be explained in due course. The

simplest way to model the population response would be to replace the transmission coefficient βx , where x stands for either A or S, by βx (1 − u(t)) as in [1], i.e., the control directly
influences the infection rates. However, the population response is typically not instantaneous, but people change their behavior with a certain delay – this is accounted for by the
last equation in (2.1). As introduced in [13], the function ψ can be seen as a time-varying
population response which decreases the transmission coefficients βA and βS in the case that
social distancing measures are in place. Possible delays in the response are modelled by the
parameters γ0 , γ1 . Note that we have ψ(t) ∈ [0, 1] for all t ≥ 0, where ψ(t) = 1 stands for the
case of no distancing at all and ψ(t) = 0 would mean that any contacts between people are
suppressed. Of course, the latter case is unachievable in practice, which is accounted for in
the model. The control input u is assumed to take only binary values, i.e., u(t) ∈ {0, 1} for
all t ≥ 0. This control signal models the policy enacted by the government, where u(t) = 0
means that no isolation measures are in place, and u(t) = 1 means that the government has
determined social distancing.
The dynamics with which these measures influence the response of the population are
modelled by the last equation in (2.1). Here, the value of the parameter ψ̄ ∈ (0, 1), see
Table 2.1, is additionally influenced by a gain function Kψ defined in (2.2); the value of
Kψ (t) decreases as the proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals increases. Assuming
that initially ψ(0) = 1 (no isolation) we may infer that

where K̄ψ = 1 − γK α1−ρ
. For further details on the model (2.1) we refer to [13, 14].

2.3. Control objective. First note that, as in [13], we assume that the class of asymptomatic infected also includes those with only mild symptoms, which typically do not seek
medical attention and are hence often not registered as infected. The class of symptomatic
infected includes those with moderate to severe symptoms which may require ICU beds and
are registered by local authorities – thus, provided that sufficient testing capabilities are
available, IS (t) is typically accurately measured.
The objective is to determine a control input signal u : R≥0 → {0, 1} which guarantees
that the number of available ICU beds is not exceeded. This control signal may serve as an
orientation for policy makers whether and when to enact social distancing measures. Since
the class of symptomatic infected individuals encompasses those which may require ICU
beds we seek to keep IS (t) below the number nICU of available ICU beds, with tolerance
ξ ≥ 0 accounting for symptomatic infected which do not require intensive care. In other
3

words, the aim is to achieve
∀ t ≥ 0 : IS (t) < (1 + ξ)nICU .

(2.4)

2.4. System class. We now turn to the specification of a class of systems described
by the epidemiological model (2.1) amenable to the control strategy proposed in Section 3.
The class of systems of the form (2.1) is defined by the set of admissible parameters

We like to note that (A1) and (A2) are typically satisfied in real epidemiological scenarios, see also Section 5. The initial values S 0 and R0 in (A2) for S(0) = S 0 and R(0) = R0
are assumed to be positive to avoid technicalities and keep the proof of the main result
simple. In fact, the assumption R(0) > 0 is true for the COVID-19 pandemic in practically
every country in the world and nearly every region by the date this article is written (and
0
taken as t = 0). Furthermore, in (A2) it is assumed that the initial values IA (0) = IA
and
1−p
0
IS (0) = IS satisfy IA (0) ≥ p IS (0), which is not a restrictive assumption since the number
of asymptomatic infected is typically much larger than the number of symptomatic infected
individuals; this is always satisfied, if IS (0) = 0, which is typically the case at the beginning
of a (local) outbreak. Finally, assumption (A3) is required to determine a non-empty range
of control design parameters, see Section 3.
3. Controller design. In order to obtain a feedback control law which is able to
guarantee the transient behavior in (2.4) (and hence to achieve the control objective), we
exploit the idea of bang-bang funnel control from [11]. “Bang-bang” means that the control
input switches between only two different values, hence this technique is suitable for our
purposes. We stress that system (2.1) does not belong to the class of systems investigated
in [11] and hence feasibility of bang-bang funnel control needs to be investigated separately.
However, due to the special structure of (2.1) a simpler control law is possible here. To be
4

precise, we consider the controller


if IS (t) ≥ ϕ+ − ε+ ,
1,
(3.1)
u(t) = 0,
if IS (t) ≤ ϕ− + ε− ,


u(t−), otherwise,
where ϕ+ , ϕ− , ε+ , ε− are non-negative parameters satisfying ϕ− + ε− < ϕ+ − ε+ and by
u(t−) we denote the left limit u(t−) = limh&0 u(t − h) of the piecewise constant function u
at t. The controller is initialized by u(0−) = 0.
In [11] ϕ+ and ϕ− are time-varying functions which determine a performance funnel for
a certain signal to evolve in and ε+ , ε− are “safety distances” required to guarantee that the
signal evolves within this funnel. In the present paper, the aim is to achieve IS (t) ∈ [ϕ− , ϕ+ ],
thus, in view of the control objective formulated in Subsection 2.3, we may choose
ϕ− := 0,

(3.2)

ϕ+ := (1 + ξ)nICU .

We emphasize that the feedback control strategy (3.1) only requires the measurement of
the number IS (t) of symptomatic infected individuals at time t, which, as mentioned in
Section 2, can be measured accurately.
In the following we identify conditions on the “safety distances” ε+ , ε− so that the
application of the controller (3.1) to a system (2.1) with a tuple of parameters from Σ is
feasible. In essence, these assumptions mean that by maintaining a strict a lockdown, i.e.,
u(t) = 1 for t ≥ 0, it is possible to guarantee (2.4). If this is not possible, then no switching
strategy can be successful.
The pairs of feasible control parameters depend on the choice of system parameters in
general. For any Z ∈ Σ we define the control parameter set

CZ := (ε− , ε+ ) ∈ (0, ∞)2 (A4)–(A5) hold ,
under the assumptions, where we use the constants defined in (2.5) in terms of Z,
(A4) ε− > χ,
(A5)

(pβA N )2
2ε− (ζM1 ε− −M3 )

< ε+ < ϕ+ − ε− .

Assumptions (A4) and (A5) are quite conservative since they are designed for worstcase scenarios, and hence they may impose hard restrictions in practice. However, the
controller (3.1) may even be feasible if these assumptions are not satisfied and appropriate
values for ε+ and ε− can be identified by simulations.
It can be seen that, while (A4) simply gives a lower bound for ε− , assumption (A5)
requires ε+ to be within a range, where both the lower and upper bound depend on ε− .
Therefore, the question arises whether (A4) and (A5) can be simultaneously satisfied. The
following result gives an affirmative answer to this question, which is based on the assumptions (A1)–(A3) on the system parameters Z.
Lemma 3.1. For all Z ∈ Σ the set CZ is non-empty and open.
Proof. We show that there exist ε− , ε+ > 0 which satisfy (A4) and (A5). This is true
if, and only if, there exists ε− > χ which satisfies
(3.3)

(pβA N )2
< ϕ+ − ε− .
2ε− (ζM1 ε− − M3 )

First we show that the expression on the left hand side is well defined, i.e., that ζM1 ε− −
M3
M3 > 0. This follows by invoking that (A3) gives ϕ+ > 2ζM
and hence we have

Condition (3.3) is equivalent to
0 > 2ε− (ε− − ϕ+ )(ζM1 ε− − M3 ) + (pβA N )2 = q(ε− )
for the polynomial q(s) = 2ζM1 s3 − 2(ζM1 ϕ+ + M3 )s2 + 2M3 ϕ+ s + (pβA N )2 . It is straightforward to verify that q 0 (χ) = 0 and q 00 (χ) > 0 for χ as in (2.5), hence χ is a (positive) local
minimum of q(s). Furthermore, we find that

Then q(χ) < 0 yields that there exists ε− > χ such that q(ε− ) < 0, which shows that the
set CZ is non-empty. Finally, from assumptions (A4) and (A5) it is clear that CZ is open.
4. Main results.
4.1. Feasibility of the control design. In the following first main result of the
present paper we prove that, for any tuple of system parameters Z ∈ Σ and any pair of
controller parameters (ε− , ε+ ) ∈ CZ , the application of the bang-bang control law (3.1)
with parameters (ε− , ε+ ) to the epidemiological model (2.1) with parameters Z leads to a
closed-loop system, which has a global and bounded solution that satisfies (2.4). Moreover,
the control input u has only a finite number of jumps in each compact set. Solutions are
considered in the sense of Carathéodory, i.e., they are assumed to be locally absolutely
continuous and satisfy the differential equation almost everywhere. A solution is said to be
maximal, if it has no right extension that is also a solution.
Theorem 4.1. Let Z ∈ Σ and consider the associated system (2.1). Further let
(ε− , ε+ ) ∈ CZ be a pair of controller parameters, ϕ+ be as in (3.2) and assume that
IS0 ∈ [0, ϕ+ − ε+ ],

D0 = 0

and

ψ 0 = 1.

Then the controller (3.1) applied to (2.1) leads to a closed-loop system which has a global and
bounded solution (S, IA , IS , R, D, ψ) : R≥0 → (R≥0 )6 such that I˙S is bounded, (2.4) holds
and u defined by (3.1) has locally finitely many jumps.
Proof. Throughout the proof we use the constants defined in (2.5) without further notice.
We divide the proof into several steps.
Step 1 : We show the existence of a local solution. In fact, repeating the arguments
of [10, Cor. 3.3] or [11, Thm. 5.3] yields a maximal solution (S, IA , IS , R, D, ψ) : [0, ω) → R6
of (2.1), (3.1) with ω ∈ (0, ∞]. Note that clearly the solution is bounded as each component
is non-negative and we have S(t) + IA (t) + IS (t) + R(t) + D(t) = N and ψ(t) ≤ 1 for all
t ∈ [0, ω). Therefore, we have that N − D(t) = S(t) + IA (t) + IS (t) + R(t) ≥ S(t) by which
S(t)
N −D(t) ≤ 1 for all t ∈ [0, ω) and hence the respective quotient in (2.1) is uniformly bounded.
Step 2 : We show that I˙S is bounded on [0, ω). This is a consequence of (2.3) and Step 1,
by which

for all t ∈ [0, ω).
Step 3 : We show that u has only finitely many jumps in each interval [a, b) ⊆ [0, ω).
Seeking a contradiction assume that there exists an interval containing infinitely many
jumps. Then there exist sequences (tn ), (sn ) ⊆ [a, b) with tn < sn < tn+1 for all n ∈ N
and, without loss of generality, tn → b for n → ∞ (otherwise we choose a smaller interval)
such that u(t) = 1 for all t ∈ [tn , sn ) and u(t) = 0 for all t ∈ [sn , tn+1 ) and all n ∈ N.
Then (3.1) implies that IS (tn ) = ϕ+ − ε+ > ε− = Is (sn ). Therefore, by the mean value
theorem there exists λn ∈ (tn , sn ) such that
IS (tn ) − IS (sn )
ϕ+ − ε+ − ε−
I˙S (λn ) =
=
→ ∞ as n → ∞,
tn − sn
tn − sn
which contradicts boundedness of I˙S from Step 2.
Step 4 : We show that ω = ∞. Since (S, IA , IS , R, D, ψ) is bounded as S(t) + IA (t) +
IS (t) + R(t) + D(t) = N and ψ(t) ≤ 1 for all t ∈ [0, ω), the case ω < ∞ is only possible
when the jumps in u accumulate for t → ω, but this is excluded by Step 3.
Step 5 : We show that IA (t) ≥ 1−p
p IS (t) for all t ≥ 0. To this end, set z(t) := IA (t) −
1−p
p IS (t) for t ≥ 0. Then

p IS (t) ≥
p IS (t), where the last inequality follows from the as1−p
sumption IA (0) ≥ p IS (0) in (A2).
Step 6 : We show that S(t) ≥ Smin (S 0 , R0 ) for all t ≥ 0, where Smin (S 0 , R0 ) is as defined
in (A3). We find that, invoking N − D(t) ≥ R(t) ≥ R0 ,

IS (t) < ϕ+ + q(τ ) = ϕ+ − ε+ +

We like to note that in Theorem 4.1 it is assumed that the initial value IS (0) lies within
a certain interval. If the upper bound IS (0) ≤ ϕ+ − ε+ does not hold, then even a hard
lockdown with u(t) = 1 for t ≥ 0 may not be sufficient to guarantee (2.4).
4.2. Robustness of the control design. In the following second main result we show
that, when the controller parameters (ε− , ε+ ) are fixed, then there exists an open subset
of the set Σ of admissible system parameters, so that the controller (3.1) with (ε− , ε+ ) is
feasible for every system (2.1) with parameters from this open set. In other words, the
controller (3.1) is robust with respect to uncertainties in the system parameters. Since the
feasibility of (3.1) follows from Theorem 4.1, it is sufficient to show that (ε− , ε+ ) ∈ CZ is
contained in any set CZ̃ for Z̃ in a neighborhood of Z.
Theorem 4.2. For all interior points Z of Σ and all (ε− , ε+ ) ∈ CZ there exists δ > 0
such that Bδ (Z) ⊆ Σ and
∀ Z̃ ∈ Bδ (Z) : (ε− , ε+ ) ∈ CZ̃ ,
where Bδ (Z) denotes the open ball with radius δ around Z in [0, 1]9 × [0, ∞)9 .
9

Proof. Let Z ∈ Σ and (ε− , ε+ ) ∈ CZ be fixed. Since Z is an interior point of Σ there
exists δ1 > 0 such that Bδ1 (Z) ⊆ Σ. For any Z̃ ∈ Σ consider the polynomial q(s) = qZ̃ (s)
defined in the proof of Lemma 3.1 and recall that qZ̃ (χ) < 0, where χ = χ(Z̃) is as in (2.5).
Furthermore, by the definition of q(s), it has exactly one zero larger than χ, denoted by
λ+ = λ+ (Z̃), and clearly q(s) < 0 for all χ < s < λ+ . Moreover, a careful inspection of the
proof of Lemma 3.1 reveals that (3.3) is satisfied with ε− = s for all χ < s < λ+ . Therefore,
with the functions
f1 : Bδ1 (Z) → R, Z̃ 7→ χ,

f3 : (Z̃, s) ∈ Bδ1 (Z) × R

f4 : Bδ1 (Z) × R → R, (Z̃, s) 7→ ϕ+ − s,
we find that, for all Z̃ ∈ Bδ1 (Z),
n
CZ̃ = (s, t) ∈ (0, ∞)2

s ∈ (f1 (Z̃), f2 (Z̃)), t ∈ (f3 (Z̃, s), f4 (Z̃, s))

o

.

Now we have that
ε− ∈ (f1 (Z), f2 (Z)),

ε+ ∈ (f3 (Z, ε− ), f4 (Z, ε− )),

and since f1 , f2 are continuous and Z̃ 7→ fi (Z̃, ε− ) is continuous as well on Bδ1 (Z) for
i = 3, 4, there exists δ ∈ (0, δ1 ) such that
∀ Z̃ ∈ Bδ (Z) : ε− ∈ (f1 (Z̃), f2 (Z̃)),

ε+ ∈ (f3 (Z̃, ε− ), f4 (Z̃, ε− )),

which finishes the proof.
While we have shown in Theorem 4.2 that, for a fixed pair of controller parameters, the
control strategy (3.1) is robust with respect to uncertainties in the system parameters, it
still depends on the structure of the model (2.1). Nevertheless, if a different epidemiological
model is chosen, replacing (2.1), then by Theorem 4.1, mutatis mutandis, the controller (3.1)
is still feasible for a suitable choice of parameters (ε− , ε+ ) and its robustness properties are
retained.
5. Simulations. In this section we illustrate our findings by a simulation of the epidemiological model (2.1) under the feedback control law (3.1). We emphasize that it is
not the purpose of the present paper to model the COVID-19 pandemic for a specific region, but to demonstrate that a funnel control approach achieves robustness with respect to
uncertainties in the system parameters.
For the simulation we consider a population of N = 105 individuals in an Example City.
At time t = 0 the population of Example City is divided into
S(0) = 0.85 · 105 − 10, IA (0) = 10, IS (0) = 0, R(0) = 0.15 · 105 , D(0) = 0,
i.e., we have ten asymptomatic infected, who, for instance, caught the disease during a stay
in another region. Furthermore, we assume that 15% of the population already developed
immunity due to a prior disease and hence belong to the class of recovered individuals.
This number may be reasonable for the COVID-19 pandemic (at least in some regions in
Germany) as e.g. the COVID-19 Case-Cluster-Study [16] (Heinsberg study) suggests.
We further assume that the disease spreads in Example City according to the parameters
that have been used in [13] and which are summarized in Table 5.1.
The number of available ICU beds in Example City is assumed to correspond to the
available capacity in Germany, which are 32637 beds (based on data from de.statista.com,

Example City with N inhabitants a number of nICU = 40 (rounded to the next integer) ICU
beds. As tolerance we choose ξ = 0.1 and we recall that ϕ+ = (1 + ξ)nICU is the threshold
that the number IS of symptomatic infected should not exceed, cf. (2.4). For purposes of
comparison, Fig. 5.1 shows the simulation results in the case that the policy makers take no
action and hence u(t) = 0 for all t ≥ 0. It can clearly be seen that the number IS (t) quickly
increases above the available ICU capacity and the number of deaths rises dramatically;
note that the effect of the exceeded ICU capacity is not considered in the model and hence
the number of deaths might even be much higher.

Fig. 5.1: Simulation of the epidemiological model (2.1) under u = 0.
In contrast to this, Fig. 5.2 shows the same scenario but with social distancing measures
enacted according to the control (3.1). For this simulation we have chosen ε+ = 2ξ · nICU ,
which is able to guarantee (2.4). Furthermore, we have chosen two different values for ε− ,
−
namely ε−
1 = 1.75ξ · nICU and ε2 = 3ξ · nICU .
Similar to various studies before, the simulations depicted in Fig. 5.2 show that social
distancing measures are capable of reducing the total number of infected individuals and,
as a consequence, the total number of disease induced deaths. The feedback controller (3.1)
is able to guarantee (2.4) as shown in Fig. 5.2 (a). It can be seen that, while periods
with u(t) = 1 ensure that the ICU capacity is not exceeded, periods with u(t) = 0 (no social
distancing) result in quick increases of infection numbers and the switch in the controller (3.1)
is triggered again after only a short period of time (at most a few weeks). This shows that
lifting social distancing measures over a longer period of time will not be feasible until the
end of the pandemic.
As shown in Fig. 5.2 (d) the control input u2 corresponding to ε−
2 exhibits a faster
switching pattern than the input u1 corresponding to ε−
1 . Several other simulations show
that larger values of ε− lead to a faster switching with shorter periods between the switches,
but, on the other hand, the pandemic is defeated at an earlier time point (i.e., the time
T > 0 for which u(t) = 0 for all t ≥ T can be made smaller the larger ε− is chosen). These
are two conflicting objectives (few switches vs. shorter pandemic) and the policy makers

have to decide which should be favored; the controller design parameters may be adjusted
accordingly.
Another observation reveals that the total number of deaths, i.e., Dmax = limt→∞ D(t)
depends on the choice of ε− . Since minimizing Dmax seems a reasonable goal we have
performed a set of simulations so that this is achieved, which led to the above value of
−
ε− = ε−
1 . As shown in Fig. 5.2 (c) the number of deaths is indeed higher for ε2 and, as
shown in Fig. 5.2 (b), the total number of infected (represented by N − R(0) − S(t)) is larger
for ε−
2.
Fig. 5.2 (e) shows the input costs associated with the control signals u1 and u2 in terms
of their L1 -norm on the interval [0, t] for t ≥ 0. It can be seen that these costs are much
higher for u1 . However, the “total costs” of the control strategy cannot be assessed by solely
12

considering the input costs, but the total duration of the pandemic and the total number of
deaths (as mentioned above) must also be taken into account when defining a suitable total
cost function – this is a topic of future research which should also involve objectives defined
by policy makers.
Finally, by way of comparison, we like to note that effective control methods for the
COVID-19 pandemic based on model-predictive control (MPC) have been developed in [9,
13]. However, MPC requires accurate model data and measurements of all state variables for
feasibility. As shown in [9], uncertainty in the data and measurements can be compensated
to a certain extent by using e.g. interval predictions, however it is not possible to prove a
priori that MPC does not exceed the available ICU capacity. This is one of the advantages
of the approach presented here.
6. Conclusion. We have presented a novel feedback controller which may serve as
a decision making mechanism for policy makers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The
controller is based on the bang-bang funnel controller from [11] and robust with respect to
uncertainties in the parameters of the underlying epidemiological model. It only requires
the measurement of the number of individuals with moderate to severe symptoms, and it is
able to keep this number below a threshold determined by the ICU capacity at any time.
Simulations illustrate that the proposed controller (3.1) is able to achieve the control
objective and that a relaxation of social distancing policies may quickly lead to increasing
infection numbers. Although a relaxation of the distancing measures over a period of only
1–2 weeks may seem pointless, the simulations suggest that a temporary increase of infection
numbers, while preventing that the ICU capacity is exceeded, ensures a less extended time
course of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to a strict lockdown. At the same time this
allows a resumption of social and economic activities during these periods. By a continuous
improvement of the available data and the simulations it should be possible to obtain better
forecasts of when the input signal switches, which would allow the people to prepare for
possible measures or relaxation.
Although the results presented in this work are quite promising regarding automated
signals for social distancing measures, this is only a first step towards a universal technique.
Future research needs to focus on methods which incorporate different levels of social distancing measures compared to only the two levels (full measures or no measures at all)
considered in the present paper. A balanced use of such regulations is more practicable and
will be accepted by a wider public. Typical examples are cancelation of big events, carrying
face masks in supermarkets and public transport or working from home when possible; these
measures may be included in the model by additional control values ui ∈ (0, 1) as suggested
e.g. in [9].
Another topic of future research is the combination of different models for different
countries or regions, where different control values (due to government policies) are active.
In particular, it needs to be investigated how the interactions between different regions,
based on migration flows, influence the spread of the disease. Such an approach will possibly
reveal which social distancing measures must be taken in neighboring regions with different
outbreak levels.
Last but not least, we like to note that the approach presented here is not restricted
to the model (2.1), but the feedback controller (3.1) can be applied, mutatis mutandis, to
any epidemiological model available in the literature, appended by the dynamics for the
population response.
