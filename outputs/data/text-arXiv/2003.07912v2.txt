A BSTRACT
During the COVID-19 outbreak, it is essential to monitor the effectiveness of measures taken by
governments on the course of the epidemic. Here we show that there is already a sufficient amount of
data collected in Italy to predict the outcome of the process. We show that using the proper metric, the
data from Hubei Province and Italy has striking similarity, which enables us to calculate the expected
number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths by the end of the process. Our predictions will
improve as new data points are generated day by day, which can help to make further public decisions.
The method is based on the data analysis of logistic growth equations describing the process on the
macroscopic level. At the time of writing of the first version, the number of fatalities in Italy was
expected to be 6000, and the predicted end of the crisis was April 15, 2020. In this new version, we
discuss what changed in the two weeks which passed since then. The trend changed drastically on
March 17, 2020, when the Italian health system reached its capacity limit. Without this limit, probably
3500 more people would have died. Instead, due to the limitations, 17.000 people are expected to die
now, which is a five-fold increase. The predicted end of the crisis now shifted to May 8, 2020.

Introduction

The present study is motivated by the paper [1] that appeared in The Lancet on 13 March 2020, where the authors are
calling for trend analysis. At the beginning of the outbreak, Italian data followed closely the exponential growth trend
observed in Hubei Province, China. The question is if Italian measures can break the exponential trend? Can they turn
the process to a logistic growth with a final saturation value like in China?
Exponential growth turns into logistic growth when the number of susceptible subjects is limited. If the epidemic is
uncontrolled, this limit is defined by the herd immunity, and the vast majority of the population gets infected. Another
possibility is when physical contacts in the social network are so severely restricted that the system remains below the
epidemic threshold [2] so that only finite-sized infected pockets can develop from infected seeds. This second scenario
is in China, where it led to the termination of the epidemic in Hubei Province and only small infected pockets in other
parts of China.
Exponential growth is described by the differential equation
dN (t)
= λN (t),
dt

(1)

where λ is the rate of growth. If we apply this for the cumulative number of cases Nn on a given day n, then the rate of
growth can be calculated from the relative growth of the cummulative number of cases
Nn − Nn−1
≈ λ.

When the exponential growth has some limit Nn < N∞ , the growth rate depends on the number of cases λ(N ) and
decreases as we approach the limit. Growth should stop when we reach the limit λ(N∞ ) = 0. We can expand the
growth rate near this point and get
1
λ(N ) ≈ λ0 (N∞ )(N − N∞ ) + λ00 (N∞ )(N − N∞ )2 + ...,

where the first derivative is negatíve λ0 (N∞ ) < 0. Introducing λ0 = −λ0 (N∞ )N∞ and b = λ00 (N∞ )N∞

write λ(N ) = λ0 (1 − N/N∞ ) + b(1 − N/N∞ ) + .... If b  λ0 , the second and higher order terms are negligable
and we can determine λ0 and N∞ from a linear fit

Next, we show that this is an excellent approximation to the actual data, which we obtained from the JHU site[3].

Deaths as seen on March 17, 2020

First, we can do a post-fact analysis of the data from Hubei Province. We have the confirmed cases and deaths data,
which both show logistic growth. Both of them have some subjective elements, and never the less the deaths data
seems to be more objective. In Fig.1, we show the daily growth rate of death cases. Since the reporting of death cases
is uneven, deaths are sometimes reported a day later. Therefore we calculate the daily rate from the average of two
consecutive days λn = 0.5 · (Nn − Nn−2 )/Nn . The first data point is January 24, 2020, three days after the lockdown
of Wuhan. The daily growth rate is fluctuating around 25-30%, which seems to be the "natural" rate of growth in the
absence of public actions. Then 14 days after the lockdown at about 500 deaths, the daily growth rate drops to about
10%. Then a linear trend sets in with some fluctuations due to some errors in the reporting. The slope of the linear fit is
λ0 /N∞ = 4.6 ± 0.4 · 10−5 , λ0 ≈ 0.146, and N∞ ≈ 3158.
We repeat the same analysis for the data from Italy and show the result in Fig.2. The Italian data starts on February 25,
2020. The beginning of the data fluctuates around 20-30% daily growth. The lockdown of Lombardy starts on March
9, at about 463 deaths, and the linear trend can be observed starting from this date. The slope of the linear trend is
λ0 /N∞ = 4.05 ± 1.13 · 10−5 , λ0 ≈ 0.243, and N∞ ≈ 5996.
Remarkably, the slope of the curve is the same in Hubei and Italy within the error of fitting. It seems that the lockdown
has a similar effect in both cases. The daily rate of growth of deaths appears to be falling 4% for each 1000 new deaths
in Italy and the daily growth rate will be reduced from roughly 24% to zero after 6000 deaths. In Hubei the initial daily
growth rate of 12% fell to zero after about 3000 deaths. It seems that this is a universal consequence of lockdown,
which needs further explanation.

Deaths after March 17, 2020

After releasing the first version of this manuscript, the situation in Italy started to change. In Fig.3, we show the daily
growth rate of fatalities again as a function of the cumulative number of deaths. We keep the original linear fit too,
which would lead to about 6000 deaths. Instead, the slope changed sharply on March 17, and the new, clearly visible
trend predicts about N∞ = 19557 ± 1670 deaths. The new slope is λ0 /N∞ = 8.1 · 10−6 , and the rate of deaths falls
only 0.8% for every 1000 new deaths. The reason for this radical change in the slope is probably not related to the
progress of the epidemic. The number of deaths is simply a proxy for the size of the epidemic. It depends on the number
of people infected and the probability of death. We assume that the latter changed drastically when the Italian health

system reached its capacity limit on March 17. Without this limit, probably 3500 people would have died. Instead, due
to the limitations, 17.000 people are expected to die now, which is a five-fold increase.

Length of the outbreak as seen on March 17, 2020

Using the fitted parameters, we attempt to calculate the expected end of the outbreak in Italy. First, we validate the
model on the Hubei data. In Fig.1, the linear regime starts when the number of deaths is N0 = 549 on February 5.
Today, 40 days later, on March 17, the number of deaths is 3111 in Hubei, which is 98.5% of the expected deaths
N∞ = 3158 or p = 0.015. Using these numbers (8) yields t = 39.44 days, which is a very precise estimate for the
length of the process. In Italy, the linear regime starts on March 9, and N0 = 463. Using the same p = 0.015 and the
number of ultimate deaths N∞ = 5996 (8) yields t = 27.49 days that is April 6. The p = 0.001 milestone will be
reached around April 15, and the lockdown can probably be partially lifted.

Length of the outbreak after March 17,2020

We can repeat the calculation with the new data N∞ = 19557 and N0 = 11591 on March 30, 2020. For p = 0.015 the
result is 23 days (April 22, 2020) and the p = 0.001 milestone is reached on May 8, 2020. Hopefully.
I would like to thank the help of István Csabai, Orsolya Pipek, Krisztián Papp, and his team for continuous discussions
and sharing the data with me. Our current forecast for the outcome of COVID-19 in various countries is now online[4].
