Abstract
The lack of recommended drugs or vaccines to deal with the COVID-19 is the main
concern of this pandemic. The approved drugs for similar health problems, drugs under clinical
trials, and molecules from medicinal plants extracts are investigated randomly to deal with the
COVID-19 infection. Molecular docking, one of the best approach to search therapeutically
potent drugs/molecules in real time with possible hope to apply on COVID-19. In this
communication, molecular docking studies of 18 ligands were carried out with the three
therapeutic target proteins of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp),
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and spike glycoprotein (SGp). The obtained results
revealed that the phytochemicals showed better dock score in compared to the drugs paracetmol
and hydroxychloroquine. Combining the dock score and medicinal properties, we believe the
terpenoids based phytochemicals limonin and scopadulcic acid B can be further explored for
potential use against COVID-19.

Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; Molecular docking; Limonin; Terpenoid.

1. Introduction
The virus strain severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a
single-stranded RNA virus caused the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, a respiratory
malady with the common symptoms of shortness of breath, cough and fever [1-4]. This disease
also reported to show other symptoms like muscle aches, loss of smell, fatigue and abdominal
pain [5]. The first infected patient was detected in December, 2019 at Wuhan, China [6].
Afterwards, total 12768307 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported globally with the death
of 566654 by 13th July 2020. The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was declared as a public health
emergency of international concern (PHEIC) and a pandemic respectively on 30th Jan 2020 and
11th March 2020 by World Health Organization (WHO).
The virus generally spread from the infected person through close contact along with
the droplets spilled during talking, coughing and sneezing [7]. After infection with the virus,
the symptoms likely to appear within two to fourteen days that depends on the age of person
and weak immunity due to other illness like diabetes, asthma, heart ailment etc. [8]. The lack
of recommended drugs or vaccines to deal with the COVID-19 along with the human to human
transmission nature is the main concern of this pandemic. Therefore, at present scenario, efforts
have been made to identify the infected persons through rapid diagnosis followed by
quarantined them to stop the further spread of this disease. Also, other recommended steps such
as using masks, washing hands with soap and maintaining social distancing are suggested to
control the spread of this virus. Simultaneously, the approved drugs, drugs under clinical trial
and molecules from medicinal plants extracts are investigated randomly to deal with the
COVID-19 infection [9]. In searching drugs/molecules from a library that contained in lakhs,
the computational approaches like molecular docking, drug-likeness screening, simulations etc.
can expedite the research on drug discovery for COVID-19 [10].
In this communication, the molecular docking studies of sixteen phytochemicals and
two FDA-approved drugs (paracetamol and hydroxychloroquine) were performed with the
2

three therapeutic target proteins of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and spike glycoprotein (SGp). The
important proteins associated with the spherical-shaped SARS-CoV-2 virus and the interaction
with the human host cell is shown in Fig. 1. The envelope of the virus consists of a lipid bilayer
made of membrane, envelope and spike structural proteins [11-13]. The club-shaped spike
glycoprotein initiates the entry of the virions into host cells by interacting with human ACE2
and TMPRSS2 host cells. Once the virus entered host cells, RdRp protein play pivotal role in
the replication and transcription of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the proteins RdRp, ACE2, and
SGp were chosen as therapeutic target proteins to search inhibitors for COVID-19. The sixteen
phytochemicals were selected from various classes like triterpenoids, diterpenoids, flavonoids,
polyphenols, alkaloids etc. with the known diverse biological activities like antiviral,
anticancer, antioxidant agent, anti-inflammatory agent, anti-dengue, antibacterial and
antimicrobial. The FDA-approved drugs hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol were used as
control for comparison, as they are claimed to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 [14-16].

2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of ligands and protein structures for docking
To study the protein-ligand interactions, the ligands in ‘SDF’ format were retrieved
directly from the PubChem (National Library of Medicine) [17] and converted to ‘PDB’
format. The crystallographic 3D structures in complex with cofactors of RdRp (PDB ID:
6M71) [17], SGp (PDB ID: 2GHV) [19] and ACE2 (PDB ID: 6M1D) [20] were collected from
RSCB protein data bank (http://www.rscb.org). The proteins were modelled using the protein
template of PDB structure from Swiss model online server, and were validated using
(https://servicesn.mbi.ucla.edu/PROCHECK/) authenticated online server. Then, the 3D
protein structures were analysed for torsion angles and missing residues using Biovia Drug
Discovery Tool by plotting Ramchandram plot.
2.2. Procedure for molecular docking
All molecular docking were done by using Autodock 4.2 to examine the protein-ligand
interactions at the active site and to estimate the binding affinity scores [21]. The preparation
of proteins and ligands for molecular docking were done by using the MGLTools. The water
molecules were removed, added hydrogen’s, confirmed torsion angles and added Kollman
charges. The grid box was generated to localise the binding positions for site specific docking.
The modelled RdRp protein grid dimensions (Å) generated for site specific docking at x:
45.6255, y: 61.9912, z: 47.4754. The grid dimensions (x: 80.9336, y: 55.4077, z: 87.9166) and
(x: 61.1524, y: 65.2399, z: 56.5904) were generated respectively for ACE2 and SGp to cover
the active site. The Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm (LA) protocol was applied to perform
molecular docking. The polar contacts, Van der Waals forces and other non-covalent
interactions between the protein and the docked ligand were predicted using the autodock
computational method. The output files generated were converted to protein-ligand complex,
and analysed using BioVia Discovery Studio Software.

3. Results and discussion
The binding energies of the sixteen phytochemicals and the two FDA-approved drugs
with the therapeutic target proteins of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., RdRp, ACE2, and SGp are
summarized in Table 1. The molecular docking results revealed that the limonin and
scopadulcic acid B are the top ranked phytochemicals than the other examined phytochemicals,
and the FDA-approved drugs hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol used as a control for
comparison [16]. Examining all the phytochemicals, the binding affinity scores revealed the
binding order limonoid>diterpenoid>polyphenolflavonoidalkaloid. The phytochemical
limonin showed highest dock score with the proteins ACE2 and RdRp, whereas the scopadulcic
acid B with SGp. Limonin is the first isolated tetranortriterpenoid that cause bitterness in citrus
and one of the limonoid known for a wide range of biological activities like antimalarial,
anticancer, antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal along with other pharmacological activities on
humans [22]. Similar to limonin, scopadulcic acid B, a diterpenoid is also known for diverse
biological activities like antiviral, antimalarial, antitumor, inhibition of bone resorption and
gastric acid secretion [23]. Therefore, the protein-ligand interactions of these two terpenoids
based phytochemicals (limonin and scopadulcic acid B) were examined in details with the
therapeutic target proteins of SARS-CoV-2.

The RdRp catalyses the RNA replication from template RNA strand. The modelled
protein structure of SARS CoV-2 RdRp comprises the nsp12 bound to nsp7 and nsp8 domains.
The nsp12 domain involved in RNA polymerase activity that contains 398-919 amino acid
residues, in which the catalytic residues were localised [24]. RdRp hydrophobic cavities at
active N-terminal and C-terminals involved in catalysis of RNA polymerization. The molecular
docking of RdRp with the phytochemicals resulted efficient binding of limonin at β-sheet nsp12
polymerase residues (Fig. 2). Limonin with RdRp showed binding energy of -9.0 kcal/mol, and
binds firmly with the amino acid residues in the RdRp tunnel can possibly obstruct the binding
of RNA template. In addition, the limonin showed comparable binding affinity like the drug
remdesivir whereas better potency than the drugs umifenovir and favipiravir at the active site
of RdRp [25]. Limonin interacts with the active residue VAL557 by van der Waals (VDW)
6

interaction. Limonin formed hydrogen bonds with the residues THR556, SER682 and LYS621
that maintains the strong affinity with the target protein. Limonin posing π-alkyl interactions
at the active site residues ARG553, TYR455, ASP623, and VDW interactions to residues
SER759, ARG624, ASP452, TYR619, GLY616, ASP618. In compared to limonin, other
phytochemicals known for antioxidant and antiviral properties like scopadulcic acid B, ellagic
acid and baicalein showed binding affinity to RdRp active site with binding energy of -8.6, 8.1 and -8.1 kcal/mol, respectively.

and (b) 3D representation showing the position of limonin within the cavity of RdRp.
Homo sapiens angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a membrane protein that
facilitates the binding to chain B domain with SGp of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The arginin and
histidine residues at the active site of ACE2 plays catalytic role for substrate binding [26]. The
top ranked limonin binds to the chain B residues ARG393 and HIS401 via carbon hydrogen
bond and π-alkyl bond that are very close to the active site, where the binding of SGp-RBD
takes place (Fig. 3). The non-covalent interactions are abundant due to multiple rings with
oxygen-atoms in limonin that are interacting with TRP69, LEU73, PHE40, THR347, TRP349,
ALA348, ASP382, ASN394, PHE390 and LEU391. Limonin shows the binding energy of 8.9 kcal/mol and actively targeting the ACE2 at cellular surface binding domain with π-alkyl
7

interactions to TRP203, and VDW interactions with GLU398, SER511, ASP206, GLN102,
GLY205, TYR202, TYR199, LYS187, ASP509, TYR510. Other phenolic, flavonoid and
terpenoid based compounds like ellagic acid, baicalein and scopadulcic acid B are binding to
the ACE2 active site with the respective binding energy of -8.4, -8.3 and -8.2 kcal/mol.

Fig. 3. (a) 2D animated pose showing non-covalent interactions between liminon and ACE2,
(b) 3D representation showing the position of limonin within the cavity of ACE2.
The receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein (SGp) play the privotal role
in binding with host receptor ACE2 to activate the virus-host interaction (Fig. 1). SGp-RDB
helps in attaching the virus to the cell membrane of the human receptor ACE2 [27]. This also
internalizes the virus into the endosomes where the conformational changes take place in the
spike glycoprotein. Scopadulcic acid B, the diterpenoid based phytochemical pose strong
binding affinity of -8.8 kcal/mol to SGp chain C residues that forming hydrogen bonds to
ASN424, ASN427 and ARG426 residues, and VDW interactions with ILE428, SER362,
PHE360, TRP423, SER358, THR359, THR425 and ILE489 (Fig. 4). These interactions may
collectively hindered the SGp-RBD docking to host receptor ACE2. Limonin, with comparable
binding at the active site is docked at the hydrophobic cavities of SGp-RBD chain C and E
residues VAL394, ARG395, GLN401, TYR494, GLY391, ILE489, SER362 with the dock
8

score of -8.4 kcal/mol. In addition, the binding affinity of scopadulcic acid B and limonin at
the active site of spike glycoprotein is comparably better than the drug remdesivir [28]. With
SGp-RBD, other phytochemicals like nimbolide, baicalein and ellagic acid poses binding
affinity to active site with the binding energy of -7.9, -7.6 and -7.5 kcal/mol, respectively.

and SGp, (b) 3D representation showing the position of scopadulcic acid B within the cavity
of SGp.
4. Conclusions
In summary, the site specific molecular docking studies were performed by selecting
sixteen medicinally important phytochemicals from various families like limonoids,
triterpenoids, diterpenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids and polyphenols etc. with three therapeutic
target proteins (RdRp, ACE2, and SGp) of SARS-CoV-2, and compared with the two FDAapproved drugs. The binding affinity scores revealed that the limonin and scopadulcic acid B
showed the higher dock score than the other examined phytochemicals and the approved drugs
hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol. Limonin, the tetranortriterpenoid found in citrus fruits
with bitter taste, known to inhibit the replication of retroviruses like HTLV-I and HIV-1,
showed the higher binding affinity score towards RdRp and ACE2. The diterpenoid
scopadulcic acid B, known for good activity against the herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), showed

9

the higher dock score with the spike glycoprotein followed by limonin. Overall, based on the
binding

order

of

examined

phytochemicals

(limonoid>diterpenoid>polyphenolflavonoidalkaloid) at the active site of the target proteins
of SARS-CoV-2 and the abundance of the top ranked terpenoids based phytochemicals in
medicinal plants like tulsi, neem, licorice, citrus etc., the outcomes of this work can be used for
searching appropriate therapeutic approach for COVID-19. Finally, despite a small library
taken for virtual screening, we proposed the terpenoids based phytochemicals like limonin and
scopadulcic acid B can be examined further for use against the COVID-19.
