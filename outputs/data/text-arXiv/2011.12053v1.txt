Abstract
As of November 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in many
countries. In Europe, the virus spread slowed considerably in the late spring due
to strict lockdown, but a second wave of the pandemic grew throughout the fall. In
this study, we first reconstruct the time evolution of the effective reproduction numbers
R(t) for each country by integrating the equations of the classic Susceptible-InfectiousRecovered (SIR) model. We cluster countries based on the estimated R(t) through a
suitable time series dissimilarity. The clustering result suggests that simple dynamical
mechanisms determine how countries respond to changes in COVID-19 case counts.
Inspired by these results, we extend the simple SIR model for disease spread to include
a social response to explain the number X(t) of new confirmed daily cases. As a firstorder model, we assume that the social response is on the form dt R = −ν(X − X ∗ ),
where X ∗ is a threshold for response. The response rate ν depends on whether X ∗ is
below or above this threshold, on three parameters ν1 , ν2 , ν3 ,, and on t. When X < X ∗ ,
ν = ν1 , describes the effect of relaxed intervention when the incidence rate is low. When
X > X ∗ , ν = ν2 exp (−ν3 t), models the impact of interventions when incidence rate is
high. The parameter ν3 represents the fatigue, i.e., the reduced effect of intervention
as time passes. The proposed model reproduces typical evolving patterns of COVID19 epidemic waves observed in many countries. Estimating the parameters ν1 , ν2 , ν3
and initial conditions, such as R0 , for different countries helps to identify important
dynamics in their social responses. One conclusion is that the leading cause of the
strong second wave in Europe in the fall of 2020 was not the relaxation of interventions
during the summer, but rather the general fatigue to interventions developing in the
fall.

Introduction

The tendency of epidemics to return in repeated waves has been known since the 1918
Spanish flu [1], and the recent COVID-19 pandemic is no exception. In November 2020, the
1

history of reported daily cases, or incidence rate, of COVID-19 varies considerably across the
world’s regions. The broad picture is as follows [2]: The outbreak in China was practically
over five weeks after a lockdown was imposed on January 23. Europe took over as the
epicenter of the pandemic in late February. After lockdowns in most European countries
in early March, followed by a gradual relaxation of these interventions, the first wave was
over in the late spring. Incidence rates remained very low during the summer until they
started to increase slowly in August. In late October, incidence rates higher than in March
are common in Europe and are growing exponentially with a week’s doubling time. The
United States developed its first wave delayed by a week or two compared to Europe and a
second and stronger wave throughout the summer. The country is now dealing with a third
and even stronger wave. Many countries in South America, Africa, and South-East Asia are
in the middle of (or have just finished) the first wave. On the other hand, a few countries,
like New Zealand, Australia, Japan, and South Korea, have finished the second wave and
managed to prevent it from becoming much stronger than the first one. Although there are
a plethora of different wave patterns among the world’s countries, one could hope that these
patterns fall into a limited number of identifiable groups.
In this paper, we do not claim that there is any epidemiological rule that states a pandemic
evolving without social intervention must come in increasingly severe waves. On the contrary,
the simple compartmental models devise the evolution of one single wave that finally declines
due to herd immunity. We shall adopt the simplest of all such models here, the SusceptibleInfectious-Recovered (SIR) model, to describe the evolution of the epidemic state variables.
However, in the SIR model, the effective reproduction number R, the average number of new
infections caused by one infected individual, is proportional to the fraction of susceptible
individuals S in the population. If initially R = R0 > 1, the daily number of new infections
(incidence rate) will increase with time t until S has been reduced to the point where R goes
below 1, and then decay to zero as t → ∞.
At present, herd immunity is not an essential mechanism in the COVID-19 pandemic
because the fraction of susceptible individuals is still close to 1 in most populations. Consequently, the time variation of the reproduction number is predominantly caused by changes
in social behavior. Changes in virus contagiousness could also play a rôle, but we have not
taken virus mutations into account in this paper. Thus, by adopting the approximation
S = 1 in the definition of the reproduction number, the SIR model reduces to a set of two
first-order ordinary differential equations for the cumulative number of infected cases J(t)
and the instantaneous number of infectious individuals I(t). These are the “state variables”
of the epidemic, which are driven by the reproduction number R(t). The evolution of the
epidemic state [J(t), I(t)] can be computed as a solution to these equations if R(t) is known.
This paper’s philosophy is to make the simplifying assumption that R(t) responds to the
epidemic state. More precisely, that the rate of change of R(t) is a function of the rate of
change of J(t) depending on a set of parameters with distinct and straightforward interpretations that characterize the response. This mathematical relationship turns the SIR model
into a closed model for the epidemic evolution, which depends on three parameters: i) the
relaxation rate when incidence rate is low, ii) the intervention rate when incidence is high,

2

and iii) a fatigue rate that gradually weakens the effect of interventions over time. These
parameters can be fitted to the incidence rate time series X(t) = dt J(t) reported by different
countries. The analysis of the fitted values of these parameters, allows to identify groups of
countries with similar evolution of the epidemics and help to understand the most effective
mechanisms controlling the epidemic’s spread. One of our findings is stated in the paper’s
title; intervention fatigue is the primary mechanism that gives rise to the strong secondary
waves emerging in many countries.
Paper outline.
Section 2.1 presents a method for reconstructing the R(t)-profile from the observed time
series for the daily incidence rate using a simple inversion of the SIR model. The method’s
effectiveness is illustrated in Section ?? by application to selected representative countries.
In Section 2.3 we compute a dissimilarity measure between the reconstructed R(t)-profiles
for each country in the world. Based on such a dissimilarity, we generate a dendrogram that
hierarchically partitions countries according to their evolutionary paths of the epidemic.
Finally, in Section 2.4 we construct a self-consistent, closed model for the simultaneous
evolution of J(t) and R(t) and describe how this model can be fitted to the observed data
for dt J for individual countries.
In Section 3.1 we synthesize the reconstructed R-curves for the majority of the world’s
countries and use the dendrogram to group them into seven clusters, which are also shown
on a World map. The features characterizing each cluster are analyzed and discussed. Section 3.2 illustrates the scenarios of the epidemic evolution that can be derived by solving
the equations of the proposed closed model for different sets of parameters. The proposed
model’s effectiveness is empirically validated in Section 3.3, where the model parameters are
numerically fit to the incidence data for some selected countries exhibiting different characteristic patterns of epidemic evolution.
The possible implications of these results for COVID-19 strategic preparedness and response plans are discussed in Section 4.

Methods
Estimating the reproduction number from incidence rate data

Let S be the fraction of susceptible individuals in a population, I the fraction of infectious,
and R the fraction of individuals “removed” from the susceptible population (e.g., recovered,
isolated, or deceased individuals). A simple model describing the evolution of these variables

is the classical SIR-model [3],

where α is the rate by which the infected are isolated from the susceptible population.
Another interpretation of α is that α−1 is the average duration of the period an individual
is infectious, which essentially depends only on the properties of the pathogen. As long
as these do not change significantly, α will remain constant in time. In this paper we use
α = 1/(8 days) but our results are not sensitive to this choice. The coefficient β, on the
other hand, is the rate by which the infection is being transmitted. It evolves in time as
societal interventions change. It is also influenced by behavioral changes in the susceptible
population, such as eliminating superspreaders. The effective reproduction number is defined
as
β(t)
(4)
R(t) ≡
α
and can be interpreted as the average number of new infections caused by an infected individual over the infectious period α−1 .
The coupled system given by Eqs. (1) and (2), with initial conditions S0 and I0 , constitutes a closed nonlinear initial value problem. Eq. (3) is not a part of this system since it is
trivially integrated to yield the removed population R(t) once I(t) is known.
The method developed in this paper is valid for an infectious disease with a new pathogen
which is transmitted by contact between infectious and susceptible individuals. This implies
that there is practically no immunity in the population from the start of the epidemic and
we shall assume that this herd immunity is low throughout the period for which we estimate
the reproduction number. In other words, we shall assume that S ≈ 1, and hence that the
cumulative fraction J = 1 − S of infected individuals is always much less than unity (J  1).
By introducing S = 1 − J in Eqs. (1) and (2), and by neglecting the term βIJ compared to
the term βI in Eq. (1), these two equations reduce to a linear model for J and I,

Note that γI (t) = I −1 dI/dt = α[R(t) − 1] is the relative growth rate for the instantaneous
number of infectious individuals I(t), which is positive when R(t) > 1 and negative when
R(t) < 1. By integrating Eq. (6) and by inserting the result on the right hand side of Eq. (5),
we obtain that the daily number of new infections dJ/dt is determined by the initial I0 and

Provided a time series for J(t) is available, we can approximate dt J as a finite difference
and the integral in Eq. (9) as a discrete sum. This sum gives us a fast and direct algorithm
to estimate R(t).

2.2

R(t)-reconstructions for individual countries

Since we do not have actual measurements of the cumulative number of infected, to estimate
the R(t)-curves for each country using Eq. (9) we rely on the number of confirmed cases as
a proxy for dt J(t). Specifically, we assume that the incidence rate dt J(t) is proportional to
the daily number of confirmed cases X(t).
The time series X(t) of new daily cases reported for each country are taken from the
Our World in Data database1 . Figure 1 shows three examples of R(t) estimated using
Eq. (9) from the new daily cases X(t) reported by Sweden, Italy, and Argentina. The initial
values assumed by R(t) are affected by different choices of I0 . The transient effect given by

the initial conditions quickly vanishes as t increases, and R(t) converges to a stable solution
since the first term in the denominator of Eq. (9) goes exponentially to zero. To compute the
results, we generated several initial conditions for I0 in a reasonable range, and we discarded
the transient phase, depicted as a gray area in Fig. 1. In these plots we have taken into
consideration the delay between the date of infection and the reported positive tests, which
may amount to approximately one week. Thus, the actual R(t) curves should be shifted
towards the left by approximately this amount.
The three countries in Fig. 1 are characterized by a different evolution of the epidemics.
Sweden had a long first wave that peaked in the middle of June and the second wave started
when the first one was not completely over. This is reflected in the estimated R(t), which
stays for a long time interval above 1. Italy had a first wave stronger than other countries,
that was brought down completely due to the lockdown. The estimated R(t) starts from
very high values and quickly goes below 1 by the beginning of April. Finally, the number
of new cases in Argentina kept growing very slowly, but consistently, until the middle of
October and there are no two distinct waves like in many other countries. Consequently, the
R(t) is characterized by values that are slightly above 1 until the beginning of November.

2.3

Cluster analysis of R(t)-curves

Rather than presenting reconstructions of R(t) case by case for all of the world’s countries,
it would bring more insight to combine them in groups of R(t)-curves according to some
common features and then analyze the characteristics of each group. Therefore, we follow
such an indirect approach where we first cluster the R(t) curves of different countries and
then analyze the clustering partition and the representatives of each cluster. The cornerstone
of each clustering algorithm is the computation of a dissimilarity measure between the data
samples. Since we are dealing with with sequential data, we leverage on a dissimilarity
measure δi,j = d(xi , xj ) that yields a real number δi,j proportional to the discrepancy between
the time series xi and xj .
A large variety of time series dissimilarity measures have been proposed in the literature,
including those based on statistical methods [4], signal processing [5], kernel methods [6],
and reservoir computing [7]. In this paper, we adopt the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
distance [8], which is an efficient and well-known algorithm that computes the dissimilarity
between two sequences as the cost required to obtain an optimal match between them. The
cost is computed as the sum of absolute differences between a set of indices in the two time
series. DTW allows similar shapes to match, even if they are out of phase or, in general, not
perfectly synchronized along the time axis.
From the dissimilarity δi,j between countries i and j, it is possible to compute a clustering partition, where similar R-time-series are assigned to the same cluster. Several approaches can be used to generate the clusters [9]. We opted for a hierarchical clustering
method [10], which gradually joins data samples together by increasing the maximum radius
of the clusters’ δmax . One of the main advantages of hierarchical clustering is the possibility
of generating a dendrogram, which allows to visually explore the structure of the clustering
partition at different resolution levels.

A closed model for model for the epidemic evolution

The SIR-model does not constitute a closed model for the evolution of J(t), I(t), and R(t).
Eqs. (5–6) describe the dynamics of the epidemic state variables J(t) and I(t) when the
evolution of the social state represented by R(t) is given. Eq. (9) is nothing but an inverse
of this relationship and should not be interpreted as a social response of R(t) to changes in
the epidemic state variables. A closed model can only be obtained by adding an equation
describing such a response. While a simple dynamical model can not reflect the whole
complexity of the social response, it may still provide some useful insight.
We shall represent this response by assuming that the rate of change dt R(t) is a function
of the incidence rate X(t) = dt J(t), and that this function is positive when X(t) is below
a threshold X ∗ and negative when it is above that threshold. When the incidence rate is
low, society responds by relaxing restrictions, and the reproduction number increases. When
the incidence rate exceeds the threshold X ∗ , restrictions are introduced that make dt R(t) to
change sign from positive to negative.
In the following, it is convenient to introduce a dimensionless time variable t0 = αt, which
allows us to formulate the differential equations as functions of the mean infectious time α−1
(which becomes the new time unit) rather than days. Accordingly, Eq. (5) can be written
as
X(t0 ) ≡ dt0 J = RI,
(10)
and we have a closed model for I(t0 ) and R(t0 ) in the form of the dynamical system,
dR
= f (X) = f (RI),

(11)
(12)

where f (X) is assumed to be a differentiable function which is decreasing in a neighborhood
of X ∗ and with f (X ∗ ) = 0. The system has a fixed point in R = 1 and I = X ∗ . In this
state, the number of infected stays constant at the threshold value.
By linearization of f (X) around the fixed point R = 1 and I = X ∗ , and by introducing
the rate constant ν = −(1/2)X ∗ f 0 (X ∗ ) > 0, the system reduces to

The damped harmonic oscillator model

In this section we demonstrate that if X is close to the threshold value X ∗ and R is close to 1,
the linearization of Eqs. (11) and (12) leads to the equation for a damped harmonic oscillator.
7

The purpose is to show analytically under what circumstances a damped oscillation is a
natural time-asymptotic state of the epidemic. In Section 2.4.2 we argue that the model
needs to be generalized to yield realistic descriptions of epidemic curves in most countries
and, hence, the present section may be skipped without losing anything essential.

which means that ∆I, ∆R, and ∆X experience the same damped oscillations with some
phase shifts, or the same strongly damped solutions.
The frequency ω (for 0 < ν < 2) and the damping rate µ (for 0 < ν < ∞) are plotted
against the parameter ν in Figure 1. The oscillation frequency and the damping rate are of
comparable magnitude for ν < 1, but the damping dominates in the interval 1 < ν < 2. For
ν > 2, the damping rate decreases towards 1 as ν increases.
The most rapid control of the epidemic is obtained when µ ≈ 2, but we also have
reasonably rapid control for larger ν. Slower damping takes place when ν < 1, and slower
the lower ν. Hence, what really should be avoided is ν much less than 1. The linearization
of f (X) around X ∗ in Eq. (11) yields

Note also that the time dependence of the reproduction number in this model is independent of the response threshold X ∗ . This is because X ∗ has been eliminated in Eqs. (13)-(14)
through normalization of the variables. The un-normalized variables I = X ∗ I˜ and X(t) are,
of course, proportional to X ∗ and emphasizes the importance of a low tolerance threshold
for social intervention.
2.4.3

Fitting model parameters to the observed incidence data

To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model in describing real data, we fit the three
parameters ν1 , ν2 , ν3 with a numerical optimization routine that minimizes the discrepancy
between the time series of reported new daily cases X(t) and those generated by the model.
We constrained ν1 ∈ [0, ∞], while the other two parameters are unbounded. Besides the three
model parameters, we also optimize with a grid search the following hyperparameters: the
initial reproduction number R0 searched in the interval [1.0, 3.0] and the value X ∗ = X(t∗ )
for each country with t∗ searched in the interval [15 January, 31 March]. As initial conditions
for ν1 , ν2 , ν3 in the optimization routine, we used the values [0.1, 0.1, 0.1].

Results and discussion
Results of the cluster analysis of R(t)-curves

The dendrogram to the left of Figure 3 depicts the result of the clustering procedure, based
on the DTW dissimilarities between the R(t)-curves estimated according to Eq. (9). In
particular, the dendrogram illustrates how two leaves i, j (i.e., the R(t)-curves of countries
i and j) are merged together as soon as the threshold δmax becomes larger than their DTW
dissimilarity value δi,j . There is no unique way of selecting an optimal δmax , but it rather
depends on what level of resolution of the clustering partition is amenable for a meaningful
exploration of the structure underlying our data. In our case, we selected a δmax = 150 that
gave rise to seven clusters, depicted in different colors in Figure 3. On the right hand side
of Figure 3, we report R(t) averaged over all the countries in the same cluster. To facilitate
the interpretation of the results, in Figure 4 we depict the same clustering partition obtained
for δmax = 150 on the political world map.
The 1st cluster (light blue) contains countries mostly from Africa, South America and
Middle East. The average R curve of the countries in the light blue cluster (top-right of
Figure 3) shows that the reproduction number is always very low, but consistently above
one. A possible explanation is that in those countries communities are more isolated and
there are less travels and exchanges between them, making the infection to spread slower.
In 2nd cluster (green) the average R curve also stays always above one, but it starts from
a higher value R0 . It is important to notice that this cluster includes large countries, like
India, Brazil, United States and Russia. In these countries, the time series of new cases X(t)
have a particular profile since they are a combination from widely separated areas where the
infection outbreak followed different courses. For instance, in the U.S., the waves in New
York and California are almost in opposite phase.

Exploring the parameter space of the oscillator model

The data for the incidence rate X(t) in the world’s countries show a wavy pattern consisting
of one to three maxima during the first year of the pandemic evolution. However, the
duration, relative strength, and separation between the waves vary substantially among
countries and regions of the world. The total cumulative number of confirmed cases and
deaths per million inhabitants can also vary by an order of magnitude or more among
countries comparable to economic development, culture, and the healthcare system. Rypdal
and Rypdal [12] demonstrated this for the first wave of the pandemic in a sample of 73
countries and discussed the significant differences in death toll between the two neighboring
countries, Sweden and Norway. At the time of writing this paper, we are four months further
into the pandemic. The picture has changed dramatically, with secondary and tertiary waves
developing in many countries.
In Figure 5, we have summarized some of the conclusions drawn from numerical solutions
of the model proposed in Section 2.4, obtained by varying the model parameters. In all
simulations, we have chosen the time origin t = 0 to be the first time the incidence rate
X(0) crosses the threshold value X ∗ . Hence, X̃(0) = 1 for all simulations. The incidence
rate measured on the right-hand axis in the figures is measured in units of the threshold X ∗ .
3.2.1

The effect of the initial reproduction number

In the first row of panels, Figure 5(a)–(c), we consider the effect of changing the initial
reproduction number R0 . From the reconstructed R(t)-curves, we observe that R0 varies
considerably among countries and regions. Low values just above R0 = 1 are common in
developing countries in South America, sub-Sahara Africa, and India. Several factors may
contribute to this; lower mobility of people, a younger population, and a warmer climate.
For these countries, we typically observe a slower rise and decay of the first wave, and the
wave is generally weaker than in industrialized countries where R0 varies in the range 2.0–
2.5. In Figure 5(a)–(c), we have changed R0 , keeping ν1 , ν2 , ν3 constant. By choosing
ν1 = 0, and ν3 = 0 we consider countries that respond slowly to an incidence rate below
the threshold and show little fatigue, which may be characteristic for developing countries
for which Figure 5(a) may be relevant. In these panels, the choice ν2 = 0.01 is somewhat
arbitrary but yields a rather stretched-out and low-amplitude first wave typical for those
countries. For higher R0 , the first wave is higher in amplitude and shorter, like what we
have seen in China. Here ν1 = ν3 = 0 signify that the relaxation rate and fatigue have been
sufficiently low to prevent R from increasing after it has stabilized below 1. The maximum
incidence rate X̃ = X/X ∗ in panels (b) and (c) is high; in the range 15-40. In panel (i),
where the parameters are the same as in (b) except for ν2 = 0.1 being ten times higher,
shows X̃ ≈ 3, which, as we will see later, is representative for China.
3.2.2

The effect of the relaxation rate

In the second row, we vary the relaxation rate ν1 while keeping the strike-down rate fixed
at ν2 = 0.01. The result is that as X̃ drops below the threshold after about 45 days, R(t)

starts to rise and grow well beyond 1. How fast this happens, depends on ν1 . In the phase
when R > 1, X̃(t) will also start growing, and when it crosses the threshold X̃ = 1, the
strike-down sets in again, and we enter a new cycle. With ν1 = 0.01 the first cycle takes
almost 500 days, while it takes considerably less time in most countries, suggesting a higher
ν1 . In panel (e) we increase ν1 by a factor 5 and observe then two cycles within the first
year, and in panel (f) another increment by a factor 10 almost eliminates the next waves.
This faster relaxation to the equilibrium R = X̃ = 1 when the relaxation rate is high may
appear counter-intuitive. After all, it leads to a rapid increase of R once X̃ has dropped
below the threshold. However, the faster rise of R also leads to a faster rise of X beyond
the threshold and to a faster strike-down of R back towards 1, i.e., to faster damping of the
oscillation. This observation suggests that the strong second wave of the epidemic evolving

14

in Europe in the fall of 2020 is not caused by the relaxation of social interventions during
the summer but is caused by something else.
3.2.3

The effect of the intervention rate

A suspected candidate could be the intervention rate ν2 , which is varied in the third row,
panels (g)–(i). However, we observe that the main effect of increasing ν2 is to decrease the
amplitude of the oscillation in X̃ in inverse proportion to ν2 . In this row, we have kept ν1 = 0,
resulting in relaxation to a time-asymptotic (t → ∞) equilibrium R∞ < 1, X̃∞ = 0. This is
in contrast to the second row (ν1 > 0), where this equilibrium is R∞ = 1, X̃∞ = 1. These two
equilibria correspond to fundamentally different strategies to combat the epidemic. The one
without the relaxation mechanism (ν1 = 0) corresponds to the strike-down strategy, where
the goal is to eliminate the pathogen without obtaining herd immunity in the population.
The one with ν1 > 0, allowing relaxation of interventions when the incidence rate dips below
the threshold, will end up with a constant incidence rate at the threshold value and thus a
linearly increasing cumulative number of infected until this growth is non-linearly saturated
by herd immunity.
3.2.4

The effect of the fatigue rate

The effect of a non-zero fatigue rate is to bring the effective strike-down rate to zero as
t → ∞. The solution of the system Eqs. (13)–(14) as t → ∞ is that R → 1 + ν3 and
X̃ ≈ exp (ν3 t). Of course, this blow-up is prevented by herd immunity, which will reduce the
effective R to zero when most of the population has been infected. The effect of increasing
immunity in the population is not included in Eq. (11), and hence the model makes sense
only as long as the majority of the population is still susceptible to the disease. Nevertheless,
the last row in Figure 5 shows that increasing intervention fatigue represented by non-zero
ν3 may increase the second and later waves’ amplitude and duration. For sufficiently large ν3
the second wave’s amplitude and duration can become greater than the first. The situations
shown in panels (k) and (l) are observed in European countries and are caused by ν3 ≈ 1.
One partial explanation of the second wave’s higher amplitude than the first, as observed
in many countries, is a considerably higher testing rate. The testing rate, however, cannot
explain the considerably longer duration of the second wave. This prolonged duration shows
up both in the observed data and in this model, when the fatigue rate is increased.

Results from fitting the oscillator model to incidence data in
different countries

Figure 6 depicts for selected countries the reported daily new cases (dashed red line), the
daily new cases simulated by the oscillator model (solid red line), the R(t) curve estimated
using Eq. (9) (dashed blue line), and the R(t) curve simulated by the proposed close model
(solid blue line). On the top of each graph, we report for each country the fitted values of
[ν1 , ν2 , ν3 ], the initial R0 , and the date t∗ that identifies X ∗ = X(t∗ ). On the horizontal axis,

The first row in the array of panels shows results for China and Turkey. The parameters
estimated for China is comparable to those in Figure 5(i). The peak incidence rate Xmax ≈
3, 500 for China is about 3 times the threshold incidence X ∗ = 1, 185, similar to what is
observed in Figure 5(i). For Turkey, the evolution of R(t) is initially rather similar to that
of China, and the shape of the X(t)-curve is also rather similar. But while the model-fitted
R(t) converges to a fixed value R∞ < 1, and X(t) to 0 after a few months in China, R(t) in
Turkey grows slowly greater than 1, and a second wave in X(t) develops. This wave has an
amplitude approximately the same as the first, but lasts longer (not shown in the figure),
similar to what is shown in Figure 5(k). This rise is the result of fundamental differences
in the estimated model parameters: ν1 is zero for China but non-zero for Turkey. We also
notice that China and Turkey belong to different clusters in the dendrogram in Figure 3.
The second wave for Turkey is not created by a finite fatigue rate, since ν3 = 0 both for
Turkey and China; it is created by a finite relaxation rate ν1 . Importantly, this relaxation
rate cannot create a second wave that is stronger than the first, it only gives rise to a damped
oscillation that ends up in the equilibrium R = 1, X = X ∗ .
The second row shows two countries, Brazil and India belonging to the second cluster,
represented in green in Figure 3. The initial reproduction number is low, R0 = 1.5 for both
countries, and the strike-down parameter is also low, ν2 ≈ 0.01, leading to a strong and long
first wave, which is not yet completely over in November 2020. The fatigue rate of ν3 ≈ 0.2
also contributes to increasing the amplitude and the long-lasting downward slope of the first
wave.
16

In the third row, we show the typical pattern for Europe, the fourth cluster (brown) in
the dendrogram, with Austria and Spain as examples. There is a rather short first wave
accompanied by a rapid drop in R(t) due to the almost universal lockdown in March 2020.
There is a rather slow relaxation of the interventions throughout the summer, finally leading
to R stabilizing in the range 1.2-1.5. The inevitable result is the rise of a second wave,
growing stronger and longer than the first, as shown in Figure 5(k) and (l). At the time
of writing, interventions again have started to inhibit the growth, but they are weaker than
in the spring, as reflected by the fatigue rates in the range ν3 ∼ 0.2 − 0.3. Indeed, the
predictions of the oscillator model with the estimated rates is that the second wave will
blow up in the spring of 2021 to levels where herd immunity will limit the growth. This
is before vaccines are likely to play an important rôle, so a more probable scenario is that
governments will reverse the fatigue trend and invalidate the model as a prediction for the
future. Tendencies in this direction is observed in Europe at the time of writing.

Discussion and conclusions

The geographic distribution of countries belonging to different clusters shown in the map in
Figure 4, and the associated averaged R(t)-curves in Figure 3, may serve as a crude road
map to the global evolution of the pandemic throughout the spring and fall of 2020. One
striking feature is some geographic clustering, which is most pronounced in Western Europe
(brown) and Eastern Europe (blue). A similar clustering is seen in the U.S. and Equatorial
Latin America (green). In this paper, we have a focus on the strength, timing and duration
of the second epidemic wave, and for this purpose the dendrogram helps us to identify those
regions where there has been a pronounced second wave so far in the pandemic. These are
those countries that belong to clusters exhibiting a period of R(t) < 1 in between periods of
R > 1. From the R(t)-profiles in Figure 3 those countries with the most pronounced second
wave are Cluster 4 (brown) and 7 (dark blue), Western and Eastern Europe, respectively.
The rise of the second wave here is due to the persistently high values of R during the
period July - November. What distinguishes the two clusters is the course of the first wave.
In Western Europe there was a strong first wave associated with high R, and it affected
strongly older age groups which resulted in high case fatality ratio (CFR). The second wave
has affected all ages and so far the death numbers have been much lower than in the first.
In Eastern Europe the first wave was very weak, but the second has been strong and with
considerably higher CFR than in the countries further West.
The main result in this paper is to demonstrate that the varying courses of the epidemic
depicted via the seven characteristic R(t) curves shown in Figure 3 to some extent ca be
understood in terms of the interplay between three social responses to the epidemic activity;
the relaxation of interventions when the activity is low, the intensification of interventions
when activity becomes high, and the intervention fatigue which develops with time. Figures 5
and 6 suggest that most country-specific epidemic curves can be qualitatively reproduced
by a simple mathematical model involving these three responses. The value of this insight is
that, in spite of the immense complexity and diversity of the dynamical response triggered
17

by this new pathogen, there are some universal governing principles that will determine the
final outcome in the years to come.
The model devised here could of course be run to make projections further ahead than
one year from the onset of the epidemic, as done in Figure 5. It would show a blow-up of
all solutions for which the fatigue parameter is non-zero, and would be unrealistic for several
reasons. One is that the linearity approximation would break down as herd immunity will
start to bring the effective reproduction number down. Another is that the intervention
fatigue model most likely will fail when the epidemic activity becomes sufficiently high. We
have already have seen signs in this direction in many European countries where partial
lockdowns and mass testing again have succeeded in “bending the curve” to an extent that
is not described by the model. Finally, mass-vaccination will hopefully become a real gamechanger in the year to come.
