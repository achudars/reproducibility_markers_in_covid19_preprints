Abstract
One of the main challenges of the measures against the COVID-19 epidemic is to reduce the amplitude
of the epidemic peak without increasing without control its timescale. We investigate this problem using
the SIR model for the epidemic dynamics, for which reduction of the epidemic peak IP can be achieved
only at the price of increasing the time tP of its occurrence and its entire time-span tE . By means
of a time reparametrization we linearize the equations for the SIR dynamics. This allows us to solve
exactly the dynamics in the time domain and to derive the scaling behaviour of the size, the timescale
and the speed of the epidemics, by reducing the infection rate α and by increasing the removal rate
β by a factor of λ. We show that for a given value of the size (IP , the total, IE and average IˆP
number of infected), its occurrence time tP and entire time-span tE can be reduced by a factor 1/λ
if the reduction of I is achieved by increasing the removal rate instead of reducing the infection rate.
Thus, epidemic containment measures based on tracing, early detection followed by prompt isolation of
infected individuals are more efficient than those based on social distancing. We apply our results to
the COVID-19 epidemic in Northern Italy. We show that the peak time tP and the entire time span tE
could have been reduced by a factor 0.9 6 1/λ 6 0.34 with containment measures focused on increasing
β instead of reducing α.

Introduction

The recent COVID-19 epidemics is posing formidable challenges both to the health and economic systems
worldwide. In order to tackle the ongoing epidemic, the countries faced with the COVID-19 epidemic have
used different strategies. In order to control the epidemic one has to lower the basic reproduction number
(also called basic reproduction rate) ρ, eventually below the threshold, i.e ρ < 1. In a simple SIR Model
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], which we consider in this paper, ρ depends on the infection rate α, the removal rate β
and the total population N . If ρ > 1 the epidemic starts with the number of infected individuals I growing
exponentially, it reaches a maximum IP at a time tP , then decreases down to zero at time tE when the
epidemic ends.
Although for severe epidemics like the COVID-19 it is very difficult to keep the reproduction number
ρ from the beginning below the threshold, nevertheless containment measures soften the epidemic because
they lead to a reduction of the epidemic peak IP .

Basically, there are therefore three types of containment measures one can use. One can act on α by
lowering it, for instance by forcing social distancing or by prophylaxis measures. One can achieve the same
result increasing β, e.g. by means of a prompt strict isolation of infected individuals. Last but not least one
can reduce the total population N by separating it in strictly non-communicating compartments.
The policies of different countries for fighting the COVID-19 usually contemplate a mixture of the three
types of measures mentioned above. Obviously, the choice of focusing on one kind of measure instead of
another depends on a number of factors, which include not only its effectiveness but also its feasibility and
its social and economic impact. For instance most of the European countries have focused their COVID-19
fighting strategies on measures aimed at reducing the infection rate α. Countries like Korea and Singapore
favoured instead measures aimed at rising β.
A general, unpleasant, feature of the epidemic dynamics is that the reduction of the epidemic peak
IP can be only achieved at the expenses of increasing tP and tE , i.e of increasing the time-span of the
epidemic. On the one hand for epidemics like COVID-19 having a high rate of hospitalised infected with
severe symptoms, reduction of IP and dilution of the epidemic is necessary in order to allow the health
systems to treat them properly. On the other hand, increasing tP means increasing the time-span in which
the containment measures are effective, with potentially disruptive effects both on the economies and the
live of the populations in the involved countries.
In this paper we investigate, in the framework of the SIR model, the impact of containment measures,
which act on α and β, on IP , tP , tE and on the epidemic speed (dρ/dt|P ). The structure of the paper is
as follows. In Sect 2, by means of a time reparametrization, we are able to linearize the equations for the
SIR dynamics. This allows us to solve exactly the dynamics in the time domain and to derive the scaling
behaviour of IP , tP , tE and dρ/dt|P , by reducing the infection rate α → α/λ or by increasing the removal
rate → λβ. We show that keeping IP fixed its occurrence time tP and tE can be be reduced by a factor 1/λ
by acting on the removal rate β instead on the infection rate α. This will be discussed in Sect. 3. In Sect.
4 we discuss approximate solutions of the SIR model in which the reproduction number ρ < e. In Sect. 5
we apply our results to the COVID-19 epidemic in Northern Italy. We show that the peak time tP and the
entire time-span of the epidemic could have been reduced by a factor 0.9 6 1/λ 6 0.34 with containment
measures focused on increasing β instead of the reducing α. Finally, in Sect. 6 we state our conclusions.

SIR model: time reparametrization and linearization

The SIR model describes the deterministic dynamics of an infective epidemic, characterized by the fact
that individuals, which have been infected and have recovered gain permanent immunity [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
Although the model is quite simple, it can be used to give at least rough estimates of epidemic dynamics,
and in particular of the COVID-19 epidemic [7, 9, 10, 11]. A generalisation of the SIR model to take into
account a large number of asymptomatic infectives -hence more apt to describe the COVID-19 epidemichas been proposed in Ref. [9, 10, 11].
The homogeneous and isolated population of N individuals exposed to the epidemic, is characterised
at time t by the number of susceptible S(t), infected and infectives I(t) and removed (recovered, dead or
isolated) R(t) individuals, with the conservation law N = S(t) + I(t) + R(t). The timescale of the epidemics
is assumed to be relatively short so that N can be assumed constant.
The dynamic describing the evolution of the epidemic is deterministic and described by the following,
non linear, dynamical system:
dS
= −αSI,
(1a)
dt
dI
= αSI − βI,
(1b)
dt
dR
= βI.
(1c)
dt
The infective epidemic is characterised by two parameters: (1) The infection rate (also called contact
rate) α, which gives the transition rate between the class of susceptible and that of infected; (2) the removal
2

rate β, which gives the transition rate between the class of infected and that of removed (1/β gives the
characteristic time for the removal of infected from the dynamics).
From equation (1b) it is immediately evident that number of infected individuals grows, i.e the epidemic
spreads, only if
β
(2)
S > γ,
γ := ,
α
where γ is the epidemic threshold. Equivalently, one can introduce the basic reproduction number ρ(t):
ρ(t) =

S(t)
,
γ

(3)

which represents the expected number of new infections generated by a single infection. The epidemic spreads
if ρ > 1. The parameters α and β depend on several factors. Some of them are attributes of the pathogen
causing the disease and cannot be changed. Other are influenced by the social behaviour of the individuals
and can be therefore changed with containment and prophylaxis measures.
The system (1a),(1b),(1c) is difficult to solve, analytically in the time domain. Usually one proceeds by
eliminating dt from Eqs. (1a),(1b), then after integration one easily finds the function I(S) = I0 + (S0 −
S) + γ log(S/S0 ), where I0 , S0 are the initial data (see e.g. Ref. [10]). This form of I(S) allows one to derive
some qualitative and quantitative features of the epidemic dynamics but not its explicit time evolution. This
latter can be only obtained by numerical integration of Eqs. (1a),(1b),(1c). For instance, one can easily find
that, if initially we are above the threshold ρ0 > 1, I(t) grows till it reaches a maximum IP , then it goes
down to zero at a time tE when the epidemic ends.
The function I(S) allows to determine analytically the value of the peak IP but not the time tP of
its occurrence, nor its entire time-span tE , nor the speed of the reproduction number VP := dρ/dt|P , nor
the average value of the number of infected individuals at the peak IˆP . tP , tE , VP and IˆP have to be
determined after solving numerically the dynamics. This is a quite unpleasant feature because it prevents
a clear understanding of the dependence of tP ,tE , VP and IˆP from the parameters α, β, which is a crucial
information for fighting the epidemic.
In order to solve analytically the temporal dynamics let us reparametrize the time introducing a new
time coordinate τ defined by dτ /dt = I(τ ), i.e.:
Z τ
dτ 0
,
(4)
t − t0 =
0
τ0 I(τ )
where t0 = t(τ0 ) is the initial time. Using time-translations we can put without loss of generality, τ0 = t0 = 0.

The new time coordinate has a simple intuitive meaning, τ (t)/t gives the average value I(t)
infected at time t:

The time reparametrization (4) allows to linearise the system (1a),(1b),(1c):

is defined implicitly by

Exact solutions of the SIR model, which are equivalent to our Eqs. (7a),(7b),(7c), (8) have been derived in
Refs. [12, 13] using a completely different approach.
Although, the integral (8) cannot be evaluated analytically, it allows to solve the temporal dynamics of
the SIR model and to investigate the scaling behaviour of the relevant quantities characterizing the epidemic
when the parameters α, β change. The previous expressions allow us to compute easily all the relevant
quantities for the epidemic peak. From Eqs. (6b) and (7a) one gets immediately τP , the τ -time coordinate
of the peak. The other quantities are readily computed using Eqs. (7a),7b),(7c), (8):

The entire time-span of the epidemic tE can be computed setting I = 0 in Eq. (7b). Because I0 is
usually small compared to S0 it can be neglected, tE is obtained by first finding the (higher) root τE of the
transcendental equation:
S0 − S0 e−ατE − βτE = 0,
(10)
and then using Eq. (8) to compute tE .
An other important quantity, which describes the intensity of the epidemics is the total number IE of
individuals that are infected over the whole time-span of the epidemics. Taking into account that I0 is
rather small and that initially S0 = N , IE can expressed in terms of the lower root SE of the transcendental
equation obtained by setting I = 0 in Eq. (7b) (see Ref. [9]) for details. We have
IE = N − SE ,

Scaling behaviour of epidemic parameters

In this section we investigate the scaling behavior of the peak quantities (9a...(9d), the total number of
infected (11), IE and tE by changing of the parameters α and β. It is already known that Eqs. (1a)...(1c)
are invariant under the scaling α → λα, β → λβ, t → λ−1 t [9]. This scaling transformation leaves invariant
the epidemic threshold γ and tells us that we can increase (reduce) the timescale of the epidemic by simultaneously reducing (increasing) both α and β. However, this is not what we are interested in. Actually,
we want to know what happens to the epidemic parameters listed above when we increase the threshold γ.
Let us first observe that both the number of infected at the peak IP (see Eq. (9a) and the total number of
infected IE (see Eq. (11) are decreasing functions of the parameter γ. In fact, we get from Eq. (9a) and Eq.

We see that above the epidemic threshold (S0 /γ > 1), dIP /dγ is always negative, while being SE < N ,
dSE /dγ is always positive.
It follows that if we want to reduce the peak and the total number of infected we have to increase γ by
a factor λ > 1. Because one can increase γ either by reducing α or by increasing β, we have to compare the
effects on the peak parameters of these two different ways of increasing γ.
We are therefore lead to consider two different scaling transformations: transformation T (1) , which
reduces the infection rate:
α → λ−1 α, γ → λγ, λ > 1
(14)
and transformation T (2) , which increases the removal rate:
β → λβ,

γ → λγ,

λ > 1.

(15)

The peak quantities in Eqs. (9a...(9d) and the τE of Eq. (10) do not transform in a simple way under
T (1) and T (2) , however the ratios of T (1) and T (2) -transformed quantities follow simple scaling laws. In
particular, they remain invariant whenever the quantity depends only on their ratio γ and not on α and β
separately.
(1)
(2)
Using the following notation to denote rescaled quantities: IP = IP (λ−1 α), IP = IP (λβ) and similarly for the others quantities, we get,

IP = IP ,

(2)

RP = RP ,
(1)

τP = λ−1 τP ,

(2)

(16a)
(1)

τE = λ−1 τE .

(16b)

The transformation law for tP and tE can be derived by first acting with the transformation T (1) on the
integral (9d), then acting with T (2) on the same integral and finally redefining the integration variable in
the second integral τ 0 → λ−1 τ 0 . One obtains in this way:
(2)

(1)

(2)

tP = λ−1 tP ,

(1)

tE = λ−1 tE .

(17)

Finally, using Eqs. (5), (16b), (17) and taking into account that IE depends only on γ (see Eqs. (11),(12))
we can easily show that the average number of infected IˆP and the total number of infected IE are invariant,
i.e.
(2)
(1)
(1)
(2)
IˆP = IˆP ,
IE = IE .
(18)
An important result follows from equations (16a),(16b),(17) and (18): epidemic containment measures, which
have the same effect for what concerns IP , RP , SP , IˆP and IE , have different impact on the occurrence time
tP of the peak, the whole time span of the epidemic tE and on the epidemic speed VP . Choosing measures
increasing the removal rate β by a factor λ instead of reducing the infection rate α by a factor 1/λ allows to
drop tP and tE by a factor 1/λ. For instance by implementing epidemic containment measures with λ = 2
we can reduce by a half both the time needed for the epidemic to reach the peak and the whole time-span
of the epidemic. It should be noticed that this epidemic timescale reduction effect becomes more relevant
for epidemics with high reproduction number ρ0 >> 1. In fact the factor λ is limited by λ < ρ0 , simply
because for λ > ρ0 the epidemic does not develop at all. Thus, if we have for instance ρ0 = 5 we can reduce
the peak time and the entire time-span of the epidemic until a factor of 1/5.
Therefore, increasing β represents an efficient way to fight epidemics. If by increasing it we manage to
bring ρ below the threshold we simply stop the epidemic, but even if we do not go so far, we can still reduce
the size of an epidemic keeping under control its timescale.
The behaviour of the reproduction number speed VP in Eq. (16b) explains clearly what is going on.
If one acts on β instead on α, VP increases, as expected, by a factor of λ. In short, increasing β instead
of reducing α, allows one to speed up the epidemic dynamics keeping constant the number of infected at
the peak, the average number of infected and the total number of infected. This is possible because the
increasing of the removal rate allows prompt removal of infected individuals.

Approximate solutions for ρ0 < e

In the general case the integral (8) cannot be computed analytically. Therefore the function τ = τ (t) has
to be computed numerically, by first performing numerical integration of the integral in (8) to find t = t(τ )
and then inverting it. There is, however, a situation in which the integral (8) can be computed analytically
and the dynamics of the epidemic until the peak, can be expressed analytically in closed form in terms of
the time t, albeit in approximate form.
For ατ << 1 we can approximate the exponential in Eq. (8) by e−ατ ≈ 1 − ατ . This approximation
allows to solve the integral and to invert the function t = t(τ ). We find,
τ≈

(19)

With this position we can easily write down the approximate form of the solutions (7a),(7b),(7c) in terms
of the time t. We quote here only the form of I(t) and tP as a function of IP ,

Eqs. (19) and (20) are a good approximation only for ατ < 1. Because τ (t), is an increasing function of t,
the approximation for the dynamics is good until the peak, if ατP < 1, which implies from equation (9c):

Application to the COVID-19 epidemic in Northern Italy

The recent development of the COVID-19 epidemic in Northern Italy represents an interesting case for
applying the results described in the previous sections. The epidemic developed in the three main regions
of Northern Italy (Lombardia, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna) we consider in this paper, starting from end
of February 2020 (although it may be possible that the epidemic was circulating in the regions before that
date).
Altogether these three regions have around 20 millions of inhabitants, we will therefore take N = 2·107 in
our computations. We take as initial value I0 = 100, which approximately corresponds to the known cases of
COVID-19 infected Northern Italy on February 23, 2020. The determination of the initial values of the other
two parameters of the SIR model α0 and β0 is more involved. These initial values are completely determined
by the pathogen because they are not affected by the epidemic containment measures put into play. The
value of α0 can be determined from the exponential behaviour of the early dynamics, or equivalently from
the initial doubling time [7, 8]. Using the raw data for the early dynamics of the epidemic in Northern Italy,
Gaeta [7, 8] has given the estimate:
10−7
α0 =
.
(22)
6
The determination of β0 is even more problematic. This is because we expect it to be sensitive to the presence
of large cohort of asymptomatic infectives. We can estimate β0 from the basic reproduction number ρ0 , using
Eq. (3). Rough evaluations of ρ0 give a number between 2 and 2.5, however the indeterminacy related to
the presence of large number of asymptomatic infectives may result in a much higher value for ρ0 . To be
rather conservative we assume here ρ0 = 3, so that Eqs. (3) and (22) give:
β0 =

1
.

(23)

The COVID-19 containment strategies put in place in Northern Italy are a mixture of social distancing,
social confinement, early detection and infection tracing. Although mainly focused of social distancing, these
strategies contain all the previous ingredients, which modify in different ways the parameters α and β. Social
6

distancing acts by reducing α, whereas systematic, prompt, and strict isolation of infected individuals as
a result of early detection and tracing enhances β. Both effects rise γ and reduce in the same way the
amplitude of the peak IP , the average number of infected IˆP and the total number of infected IE .
Because it is almost impossible to disentangle the effects of the various containment measures on α and
β in the real situation, we will discuss and compare two hypothetical situations in which the rising of γ,
γ → λγ0 , with γ0 = (2/3) · 107 , is obtained in two fully distinct and complementary ways:
• (1) We have exclusively social confinement containment measures: β is held fixed to its initial value
β0 , whereas α0 is reduced by a factor 1/λ.
• (2) We have exclusively containment measures consisting in prompt and strict isolation of infected
individuals triggered by early detection and tracing of infected: α is held fixed to its initial value α0 ,
whereas β0 is increased by a factor λ.
Being 1 6 λ < ρ0 we consider the following values: λ = 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 2.9. Using Eqs. (9a)...(9d) we compute
for these values of the parameters α and β the peak quantities: peak amplitude IP , the time tP (in days) of
occurrence of the peak (computed by numerical evaluation of the integral (9d)), average number of infected
IˆP and absolute value of the epidemic speed at the peak |VP | (in days−1 ). Moreover, using Eqs. (11), (12),
(10), together with Eq. (9d), we compute numerically the total number IE of infected individuals during
the epidemic and its whole time span tE (in days). The results are shown in Table I. Our results are in
accordance with the scaling behaviour given by Eqs. (16a),(16b), (17)and (18).
We see from Table I that the raising of the epidemic threshold for γ from the initial value γ0 first to 2γ0
then to 2.9 γ0 let both the number of infected at the peak and their average number drastically sink from
the order of magnitude 106 first to 105 and then to 103 − 104 . This reduction is the same independently of
the fact that if it is achieved by reduction of α (way (1)) or by increase of β (way (2)). Similarly, the total
number IE of infected individuals drops from the huge value 1 1.88 · 107 till 1.16 · 107 (for λ = 2) and then
to 1.3 · 106 (for λ = 2.9)
On the other hand, the two ways of reducing IP and IˆP and IE affect differently the occurrence time of
the peak tP and the whole time span of the epidemic tE . By acting on β (way (2)) instead of on α (way (1))
we can shorten these times by 33% (for λ = 1.5), by 50% (for λ = 2) and even reduce it by almost 1/3 (for
λ = 2.9). Correspondingly, the speed of variation of the basic reproduction number |VP | will be enhanced
by the same factors.
If the containment measures can manage to increase λ above 3, we go below the threshold for ρ and the
epidemic does not start at all. Obviously, in a real situation reducing α or increasing β is not performed once
for all at the beginning, but occurs in steps. Our main result is that in order to try to stop the epidemic it
is much more convenient to rise β instead of lowering α because even if we do not manage to stop it, we are
able to reduce its size and at the same time to shorten its timescale.

Concluding remarks

In this paper we have analysed, in the context of the standard SIR model for epidemic dynamics, the impact
of different containment measures on size (the epidemic peak IP , the average number of infected IˆP and the
total number of infected IE ), the timescale (the occurrence time of the peak tP and the whole time-span tE )
and the speed (time variation of the reproduction number |VP |) of epidemics. Using an exact solution for
the epidemic dynamics we have been able to derive the scaling behaviour of these quantities under change of
the two parameters (the infection rate α and the removal rate β) of the SIR model, which can be controlled
by the containment measures. This allowed us to compare the impact on size, timescale and speed of the
epidemic of containment measures acting either on α or on β
We have shown that for a given reduction of IP , IˆP , IE , the timescale and the speed of the epidemic
are to a great extend sensitive to the kind of measures we put into play. By increasing the removal rate β
instead of reducing the infection rate by a factor λ one can reduce the timescale of the epidemic by a factor
1/λ and increase the speed of the epidemics by a factor λ. In the case we have analysed in detail, namely
the COVID-19 epidemic in Northern Italy, the reduction factor λ, in principle could also take values around
3.
An important point we have not addressed in this paper is the determination of the exact way in which
the usual containment measures used to fight epidemic, impact on the values of the parameters α and β.
Whereas it is quite clear that social distancing reduces the parameter α and does not change β, the effect of
other measures like, early detection and contacts tracing is not a priori evident. Early detection and contact
tracing increase β only if implemented on a large scale and followed by prompt and strict isolation of the
detected infectives. If this is not the case, it is likely that these measures just bring a small reduction of α
The recent analysis of Gaeta [10] of the different strategies used in Northern Italy to tackle the COVID19 epidemic seems to confirm this result. He found that simple early detection and contact tracing, while
having an impact on the epidemic peak, do not substantially affect the timescale of the epidemic. On the
other hand he also showed that contact tracing if followed by prompt isolation is the only efficient way to
reduce the size of the epidemic, without having to live with it a long time. The Veneto experience shows
that this was one of the factors underlying the success of the containment strategy in that region. Thus the
main lesson one can draw from our results is that, epidemic containment measures focused on tracing, early
detection followed by prompt removal of infected individuals are more efficient to fight epidemics than those
based on social distancing.
Let us conclude this paper with some comments about the range of validity of our results. The SIR model
is an oversimplified model for epidemic dynamics. Generalisations of it are necessary in order to give a good
descriptions of real epidemics. For instance, in the case of the COVID-19 epidemic a generalization of the
SIR model seems to be necessary in order to take into account the presence of a large set of a asymptomatic
infective [9, 10, 11]. On the other hand, the SIR model gives the bare bones of deterministic epidemic
dynamics. For this reason we believe that, at least at qualitative level, the main result of this paper - the
possibility to reduce the epidemic peak keeping under control its timescale by acting on removal rates- could
remain true for generalized and improved SIR-like models.
