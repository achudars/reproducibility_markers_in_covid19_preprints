Abstract This paper is concerned with nonlinear modeling and analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic currently
ravaging the planet. There are two objectives: to arrive
at an appropriate model that captures the collected
data faithfully, and to use that as a basis to explore
the nonlinear behavior. We use a nonlinear SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious & Removed) transmission
model with added behavioral and government policy
dynamics. We develop a genetic algorithm technique
to identify key model parameters employing COVID19 data from South Korea. Stability, bifurcations and
dynamic behavior are analyzed. Parametric analysis reveals conditions for sustained epidemic equilibria to occur. This work points to the value of nonlinear dynamic
analysis in pandemic modeling and demonstrates the
dramatic influence of social and government behavior
on disease dynamics.

CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that was first identified
in China in early December 2019. It has since become a
global pandemic devastating the health, economy and
lives of billions of people all over the world and has
brought into sharp focus the need for accurate modeling
of infectious diseases. The global government policies
are in fact largely being driven by statistical analyses
loosely based on nonlinear mathematical models that
underlie epidemiology. As we write this paper, there is
also a rising controversy about the predictive power of
these models. The crux of the matter is that there is
a trade-off between economic disruptions and deaths.
If the model predictions are incorrect in terms of overprediction, we may be creating mass unemployment and
hurting billions of lives by causing economic deprivation. On the other hand, if the model predictions are
wrong through under-prediction, then too many unnecessary deaths would occur. This quandary that most
political leaders are finding themselves in points to the
need for high accuracy in the models.
Mathematical modeling in epidemiology has a long
history dating back to early models by Bernoulli in
the eighteenth century [1,2], although most current research uses models built on those developed in the 1930s
by Kermack and McKendrick [3,4,5]. These are called
compartment models, and constitute a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, where the state variables represent the population numbers in various stages
of the infectious disease progression, which are described
below [6].
– Susceptible individuals (S). There is no detectable
level of pathogens, and the individual’s immune system has not developed a specific response to the
disease-causing pathogen.
– Exposed individuals (E). The individual has come
into contact with an infected person and is infected,

2

but exhibits no obvious symptoms and has low levels
of the pathogen that is not high enough to sustain
a transmission to other hosts.
– Infected individuals (I). The number of pathogens
has increased to a point that it is now possible to
transmit to other susceptible individuals.
– Removed individuals (R). The individual’s immune
system has possibly won the battle and reduced the
number of parasites significantly and he/she is no
longer infectious. Or, the individual has been isolated from the population, or, alas, he/she has succumbed to the disease and died. In all of these cases,
the individual is said to be removed.
Note that it is common practice to model the number of individuals in each of the above categories as
fractions of the nominal population. We should also observe that other potential variables could be included
to account for quarantines, vaccination, etc. The key
factors that govern the dynamics are the growth rate of
the pathogen and the level of interaction between the
pathogen and the host’s immune response.
As in all modeling, we will have to make a compromise between predictive accuracy and complexity. In
addition, since we are using real data, the task of estimating accurate parameters becomes intractable, if not
impossible, with a very complex model. Considering all
these factors, we will consider a SEIR model (describing
susceptible, exposed, infected and removed individuals)
as described further in the sequel. We will modify the
SEIR model with two important features: the effect of
government action and that of public reaction. These
two behavioral actions represent social dynamical variables and are especially relevant to the accuracy of predictions as we will show. Of all the nonlinear phenomena we may expect to find, it is important to note that
endemic equilibrium points are probably most critical
to identify; that is to say, we are interested in knowing
under what conditions the disease will persist, and not
vanish.
Especially with growing interest in the impact of
the COVID-19 virus, there has been an explosion of
research papers in modeling and prediction. It is hence
not possible to refer to all - or even a large percentage
- of them. What follows is hence a snapshot focusing
somewhat on the subject of the current paper.
As mentioned earlier, the epidemiological models
have a rich history after Kermack’s original work. There
are several excellent and modern text books [6,7,8,9]
that describe the fundamental mathematics of epidemiology and discuss the relevance to real historical data
of infectious diseases, and we refer the reader to them
for a clearer understanding of the model assumptions,
derivations and implications. Hethcote’s paper [10] is

Kwuimy et al.

an especially instructive review and [11] is another that
skews towards policy decisions.
In terms of nonlinear dynamics, early work by [12,
13] analyzed the effect of seasonal fluctuations as well
as contact rate periodicity in what essentially becomes
a forced response problem resulting in harmonic and
subharmonic resonances. Several authors have analyzed
the occurrence of periodic solutions through Hopf bifurcations in an SEIR model due to the presence of time
delays and nonlinear incidence rates [14,15,16,17]. [18]
discovered infinite subharmonic bifurcations in a similar seasonally forced model, while [19] analyzed bifurcations in the context of limited hospital resources. [20]
is a contemporary review summarizing the literature in
seasonal dynamics. Chaotic motion has also been documented in [21,22]. Finally, [8] provides a clear exposition of nonlinear dynamic phenomena in her monograph.
We should note that the key parameters that can
be quite powerful in estimating – and controlling –
the spread of epidemics, are the so-called reproduction
number (R0 ) and incubation period. In particular, it
can be shown even with the simplest models that the
disease will persist if R0 > 1, and will die out if this
number is less than 1. Much of the control techniques
that the governments use are focused on achieving this
goal by reducing the transmission rate that eventually
controls R0 . From the point of view of mathematical
analysis, this creates an interesting situation of a timevarying parameter that is usually discontinuous as government polices are often implemented like step functions. It should be noted that the incubation period is
characteristic of the virus, and is less under our control.
It has been estimated to be 6-7 days [23,24].
As mentioned earlier, COVID-19 has spawned a rich
collection of publications, and we do not deem it necessary to document them here. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note the rapid revelations that have come out
of these admittedly short-term studies, many of them
focusing on data from Wuhan, China, where the virus
apparently originated. WHO [25] reports that the earliest infections were identified there around the first
of December and the infections declined by the end
of February with strong government action as well as
public reaction. The crude fatality rate was estimated
to be a shockingly high 3.8%, although the real number is in all likelihood much lower since the number
of infected individuals is heavily undercounted due to
logistical limitations in testing, and given that a significant segment of the population is probably infected but
asymptomatic.
In quick studies, several researchers [26,27,28] have
estimated the essential epidemiological parameters us-

SEIR model with government action

ing early data from Wuhan, China, in particular, they
found R0 to be in the range of 2 to 3. [29] estimated
the reproduction number to be 2.7, which is larger than
the earlier SARS epidemic, which would make it more
dangerous than SARS. [30] estimated that the travel restrictions that the Chinese government imposed brought
down R0 from 2.35 to 1.05, effectively bringing the infections in Wuhan under control. Even more impressive
was the effect of aggressive restrictions on the Diamond
Princess cruise ship, which was estimated to reduce R0
from a devastating 14.8 to a more manageable 1.8 [31].
Several papers have been published attempting to estimate the growth in other areas of China and the world.
[32] estimated R0 to be 2.7, and predicted similar transmission rates for other cities in China, and [33], published in mid-March assuming a reproduction number
of 2.4, suggested mitigation strategies for various countries, principally US and UK. This last report was quite
influential and led to these two governments to start implementing policies with the objective of “flattening the
curve” of cumulative infections.
The focus of our study is twofold.
– We select a data set for COVID-19 that is reasonably complete and accurate and develop a mathematical model that is best able to represent the
data.
– Given the above fitted model as a starting point, we
wish to explore the fundamental nonlinear dynamics
of the system and perform a parametric analysis to
explore the effect of social dynamics.
The reason we use the actual data (in this case, South
Korea’s) is to keep us grounded in reality and to anchor
our parametric studies around this particular situation.
In addition, we expect that a parametric analysis will
show the tremendous implication of various actions on
the progression of the disease. In general, our analysis is
intended to be relevant to the current situation. Given
that, as of the writing of this paper, the COVID-19
situation is still evolving with considerable uncertainty
about the future, we wish to use this paper to validate
the importance of mathematical modeling in general,
and nonlinear dynamic analysis in particular, to enhance our insights.
Building on the above objectives, the rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, we describe the modified SEIR mathematical model we employ in this study.
Next, we describe the data collection and properties.
Then, we describe a numerical algorithm we employed
and coaxed to get the best parametric fits. The next
section carries out the nonlinear dynamic analysis and
describes the interesting results we have achieved. Finally, we discuss the implications of the model and the
results and end with a conclusion.

2 Notes on Mathematical Models
We adopt the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed
(SEIR) framework with a total population size of N .
In this model, S, E, and I represent the susceptible,
exposed and infectious populations and R represents
the removed population. For completeness, it is best
to start with a standard SEIR model as illustrated in
Fig. 1 [6,8].

S ′ = Λ − βSI − µS
E ′ = βSI − σE − µE
I ′ = σE − γI − µI
R′ = γI − µR

(1)

where, ′ denotes derivative with respect to time.
In this model, β is the transmission rate, µ is the
death (and emigration) rate, σ, the incubation rate,
is the reciprocal of the latent period (assumed to be
the same as the incubation period in this model), and
γ is the removal rate, and hence the reciprocal of the
recovery period (if removal is due to recovery). Note
that E represents those who are exposed but not yet
infectious. We make two modifications to the standard
model as described below.
The first modification concerns the specific nature
of COVID-19 and concerns the fact that infected people
can be contagious before they show symptoms during
the incubation period. Hence, it is possible that susceptible individuals would have had contact with individuals in both the exposed and infected categories. Here,
we will model the two paths from S to E using two
values of β, say β1 and β2 . Emulating [34,35], we will
assume that β2 = β1 /2, or that the probability of contacts with asymptotic infected individuals is half of the
probability of contacts with exposed individuals. The
modified model now becomes:
S ′ = Λ − β1 SI − β2 SE − µS
E ′ = β1 SI + β2 SE − σE − µE
I ′ = σE − γI − µI
R′ = γI − µR

(2)

The second modification, illustrated in Fig. 2, concerns the influence of two important sociological (and
arguably, political) parameters: social behavior and government policy. Here, we consider the transmission rates
to be variable and change with these parameters [36,

37]. Then, the modified model becomes
S ′ = Λ − Υ − µS
E ′ = Υ − (µ + σ) E
I ′ = σE − (µ + γ) I
R′ = γI − µR
D′ = dγI − λD

(3)

where, we have defined an infection function Υ as follows.
Υ = (1 − α) [β1 SI(1 − D)κ + β2 SE]

(4)

Here, α represents the strength of the government action and κ is the strength of public response. Note that
D is a new state variable representing social behavioral
dynamics. d represents the strength of public perception
of risk, 1/λ is the mean period of public response, and
the model reflects the fact that public reaction would
increase when more people get infected, and would naturally diminish over time.

3 Parameter Identification
3.1 Data
We use the data from South Korea as our dataset for
model fitting for several reasons. Compared to USA,
where the testing kits are in significant shortage, and
China, in particular Wuhan, where the infected cases
went up abruptly in a short period and hence massive
testing might not have been available, the South Korean government was prepared with appropriate emergency measures since January 20th, when it changed its
infectious disease alert (in the national crisis management system) category from Level 1 (blue) to Level 2
(yellow) [38]. Such measures provided massive testing
capability in South Korea to enable one of the most
accurate datasets available.
We examined various databases of South Korea and
finally selected COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at
Johns Hopkins University [39] due to its complete record
and accessible interface. In particular, the database provides time series data containing daily updates on the
new infected cases, death cases, and recovered cases, all

3.2 Genetic Algorithm
Inspired by Charles Darwin’s theory of natural evolution, Holland introduced and popularized general-purpose
search algorithms that use principles of natural population genetics to evolve solutions to problems, called
genetic algorithms (GA) [40]. The basic idea in GAs is
that evolution will choose the fittest species over time.
Through emulation of the natural evolution of biological organisms, GA produces a population of individuals
(potential solutions in each iteration) to search the solution space of the problem and evolve them through
generations to approach the optimal solution. In each
generation, the fitness of individuals is evaluated using
an objective function and the fittest ones have higher
probability to participate in the offspring production
process of the next generation. Three main types of
operators are employed in GA to guide it towards a
solution:
– Selection to choose between the solutions;
– Mutation to create and keep genetic diversity; and,
– Crossover to combine the existing solutions into
new ones.
Finally, when the stopping criterion is met, the best
individual is presented by GA as the solution to the
optimization problem.
In this part of the study, the objective is to identify the parameters of the model in such a way that
the simulated data matches the real data as much as
possible and then use the tuned model to analyze and
forecast the spread of COVID-19 in the future. The
simulated data is obtained by numerically solving the
model in Eq. 2 using an integration algorithm (we used
sixth order Runge Kutta algorithm). To accomplish the
first part, namely parameter identification, we use GA
to find the parameter values which minimize the cost
function between the model prediction and real data.
We devise the cost function based on a weighted sum
of the mean square error for both infected and removed
data. Furthermore, as the main purpose of the model
is to predict the future, and as the error at the end of
the training time span is reflected significantly on the
future time evolution, a penalty factor was included in
the cost function for the end points.
The cost function, f is hence defined as follows:
t=s 2
f = WI [Mean(Ir − Im )2 + αp [(Irt=s − Im
)
t=e 2
+ (Irt=e − Im
) ] + (1 − WI )[Mean(Rr − Rm )2
t=s 2
t=e 2
+ αp [(Rrt=s − Rm
) + (Rrt=e − Rm
) ]

(5)

SEIR model with government action

where R, I, r, m, s and e stand for removed cases, infected cases, real data, model predicted data, start date
and end date, respectively. Also, WI and 1 − WI are,
respectively, the infected and removed patient weights,
and αp is the penalty factor for the end points. For
this part of the study, the model described in Section 2
was used with the assumption that µ and Λ are zero.
The target parameters are β1 , β2 and γ while σ was
assumed to be 0.14, equivalent to incubation period of
7 days for COVID-19 [41]. We will consider the population to be constant; in other words, we assume that
N does not change. This means that the natural mortality (including emigration/immigration) rate (µ) as
well as the birth rate (Λ) are zero. This assumption is
reasonable over the short time period of analysis.
As explained earlier in this study, factors like government actions can significantly affect the trend and
pattern of disease spread and accordingly, the SEIR
model parameters. So, in this study we solved the parameter identification problem for two separate time
spans, i.e., controlled and uncontrolled [42].
Totally, the recorded data of 108 days was employed
in this study (Jan 22, 2020 to May 8, 2020). The uncontrolled data was taken for first 40 days (Jan 22, 2020
to March 1, 2020) and controlled data for the next 68
days (March 2, 2020 to May 8, 2020). Out of 68 days of
controlled time span, first 40 days were used for model
tuning and the next 28 days for evaluating the performance of the model in forecasting the unseen data.
The total population of South Korea was taken to be
51,269,185 from standard sources.
3.3 Results
The process of optimum selection of the optimization
variables was accomplished with a population size of
200 with a cross-over probability of 0.8 for 300 generations. For uncontrolled and controlled time spans, the
value αp and WI was 10 and 0.5, respectively. WI = 0.5
means that the model predicted removed and infection
rates have the same weights in the cost function and so
the optimization algorithm tries to make both of them
close to the real data, simultaneously and equally. Also,
αp = 10 means that the square error of model infection
and removed rates at each end point has 10 times more
effect on the cost function than the mean square error
of all 40 days and this enforces the model to be close to
the real data at the end points. The initial number of
infected and removed cases for the SEIR model in both
periods was considered as the real data, i.e., I0 = 1 and
R0 = 0 for uncontrolled and I0 = 3736 and R0 = 47
for controlled time span. Also, due to lack of E0 (initial
number of exposed individuals) in the available dataset,

5

it was assumed to be two times I0 . The trend of optimal tuning of the model parameters for the controlled
time spans is shown in Figure 3. The convergence of the
best fitness value range, including best, mean and worst
values, to an optimum condition over 300 generations
is demonstrated in the logarithmic form in this figure.
The GA parameter identification results are tabulated in Table 1. As can be seen in this table, the values
of model parameters changed significantly with transition from uncontrolled to controlled time span owing
to strong actions which were imposed to control the
disease transmission in South Korea. The effect of this
change in the parameter values is clearly seen in the
comparison between the trend of individual numbers in
the uncontrolled (Figure 4) and controlled (Figure 5)
time spans. The sharp drop in the number of active infected individuals and reduction in the growing slope of
accumulative removed cases shows that the actions that
have been taken in this country to control the COVID19 spread have been quite successful.
Comparison of model and real data for the first 80
days indicates that parameter identification for both
uncontrolled and controlled conditions has been performed, appropriately, and there is good agreement between them. Also, it is observed that the model was
able to forecast the unseen data of days 81 to 108 quite
well. Nevertheless, there is still a difference between real
and model predicted data. Some possible reasons include perhaps overly simplistic modeling of sociological behavior and government actions and inaccuracy in
the assumed model parameters like σ, E0 , Λ and µ. It
should also be noted that the number of infected individuals is a measure of the amount of testing that was
done, which has not been comprehensive, and hence
the numbers can be inaccurate. For all these reasons,
the fluctuations seen in the real data are not predicted
precisely by the model, but it is clear that the general
trends of variation of both infection and removed rates
are quite similar.
4 Nonlinear analysis
This section focuses on the disease extinction or persistence, which is determined by the stability of the disease
free equilibrium and the existence of endemic equilibrium. Prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemics
require a better understanding of its mode of dissemination as well as the impacts of control strategies. The
analysis considers a naı̈ve scenario where there is no
governmental action, which is unlikely but will provide
a baseline to appreciate the effects of the action. In the
second and third scenarios we consider the effects of
individual reaction and the governmental action.

It is obvious that E 0 (Λ/µ, 0, 0, 0) is a trivial solution of
Eq. (9). E 0 is called the disease free equilibrium since
it is obtained for I = E = 0 and the corresponding
infected function Υ is zero. For I 6= 0, the model in
Eq. (2) has a non-zero solution E 1 given by Eqs. (7).

obtained from Section 3 (β2 = 0.0628, β1 = 0.407)
we get the endemic equilibrium of Fig. 6b. The effects
of the transmission rates β1 and β2 are illustrated in
Fig. 6b. The figure considers the situation of fewer contacts with infected individuals (β1 < β2 , most/some infected individual are in quarantine assuming the same
probability of contamination once in close contact), and
compares it to the situation where we have higher probability of contamination with infected individuals, or
β1 > β2 ). Beyond R0 = 1, the proportion of infected
individuals naturally increases and is higher when β2 >
β1 . This can be interpreted to mean that exposed people will have a greater impact on the persistence of the
disease. These results confirm the observations of the
number of newly confirmed cases due to close contact
with exposed and infected individuals in Wuhan, China
[35].

however, note that we do not consider the effect of public reaction here, hence we drop D from the equation.

Figure 8 gives two different views of how the government action could contribute to control the spread of
the disease. As might be expected, stronger governmental action (higher values of α) has more impact on the
disease (Fig. 8a). But, what is more interesting is that
the results predict the existence of a threshold value
αc expressed as a function of the transmission rate,
that would lead to complete control of the disease. This

SEIR model with government action

threshold value is higher for lager values of β2 . In practice of course, there would be a natural limit to the
governmental action. For this reason, additional controls would be needed. The literature that documents
past infectious diseases similar to the COVID-19 have
shown how an increase in the number of deaths and the
severity of critical cases can be leveraged to impact the
perception and seriousness of the population.

where, the subscript c stands for control.
The transcendental equation would not lead to an
explicit expression of Ic0 . Thus, guided by the literature, we limit the analysis to some specific cases.

For κ → ∞
4.3 System with additional control
We now take into consideration the combined effects of
the government action and the public perception of risk
regarding the number of severe and critical cases. The
variable D is added to the model to represent the public
perception of risk. It increases when people die, and
will decay naturally, meaning that perception of risk
diminishes over time in the absence of the COVID-19.
The intensity of this perception is carried through the
intensity of the population response κ and proportion
of severe cases d. The infection function is now
Υ = (1 − α) [β1 SI(1 − D)κ + β2 SE]

(20)

which would be substituted into the model given by
Eq. 3.
Proposition 3: The system in Eq. 3 under control has a higher threshold for the onset of endemic
equilibrium. This onset value is R0 = 1 for κ = 0 and
R0 > 1 + κeffect for large values of κ, where
κeffect =

This can be proven graphically as shown in the Appendix.
Figure 9 shows how the intensity of the population
response could impact the spread of the disease. In fact,
under this control, the number of infections is considerably reduced as shown in the figures. In Fig. 9a, there
is a jump in the number of infected for small R0 . This
jump is significant for smaller value of κ and is likely a
manifestation of the nonlinearity in κ in the expression
of the infection function. Recalling that the endemic
equilibrium used here was obtained for κ → ∞, the results of Fig. 9a are only valid for larger values of κ. This
nonlinearity is not visible in the presence of α as shown
in Fig. 9b.
Figure 10 shows an illustration of the system response for a naı̈ve scenario where there is no governmental action (Fig. 10a), the effects of governmental action alone (Fig. 10b), individual reaction alone (Fig. 10c)
and combined action (Fig. 10d). Simulation and analytical derivation show that, carefully setting the parameters (in the specified range of vales) could effectively
stop the spread of the disease under combined actions.

– The reproduction number, traditionally computed
for SEIR model in terms of σ, Λ, µ and γ has been
expanded to include β1 , β2 , and the social and policy parameters, α and κ. This expanded definition
embeds social dynamics neatly into the epidemiological model and significantly expands insight into
their interactions.
– The parameter values for transmissibility (β1 , β2 ),
and hence, the reproduction number (R0 ) went through
significant reduction with the South Korean government response roughly 40 days after the first incidence.
– Exposed people (as opposed to infected individuals) have a greater impact on the persistence of the
disease.
– The stronger the government action, the more the
impact on disease transmission.
– There is a minimum threshold value for government
action (αc ) for complete control of the disease. Our
model predicts that numerous small, tentative steps
would not be as effective as bolder and significant
steps.
– The intensity of the public response (κ) has significant impact on the reduction of number of infections.
– The model predicts that for some values of the disease dynamics, the public perception κ will have no
effects. In this case only the governmental action
could stop the spread of the disease.
– The analysis predicts that a suitable combination
of government response (α) and public reaction (κ)
would effectively stop pandemics such as COVID19.

(30)

In this paper, we adapted and developed an SEIR model
for the COVID-19 pandemic including different transmission rates for contacts with infected and exposed,
and integrated parameters and variables to model government action and social reaction. First, we used data
from South Korea to perform a parametric analysis using the genetic algorithm and achieved a very good fit.

SEIR model with government action

This provides sound validation for our model. The resulting numerical analysis shows that the South Korean
government action 40 days after the infection was first
diagnosed had a significant influence on the spreading
of the disease.
Next, we used more nuanced models for nonlinear
dynamic analysis. Equilibrium and stability analysis
were performed revealing several areas of the parameter space where a stable endemic equilibrium can exist leading to persistent infections. We considered three
situations: (a) without control, (b) with government action, and (c) with combined effect of government action
and public reaction. Results show that it is possible to
stop the spread of the disease (or to extinguish the endemic equilibrium) by proper choice of parameters that
govern social and government behavior.
In this paper, by seamlessly integrating two important sociological (and arguably, political) parameters,
i.e., public perception and government policy, we are
able to show the fact that these factors can significantly affect the transmission rate and spread pattern
of disease evolution. The conclusions would support an
argument that stronger government actions and policies such as quarantine, wearing masks, social distancing, and improving public perception might be essential in combating the COVID-19 spread. Indeed, this
is demonstrated in South Korea, which has arguably
achieved tremendous success in combating COVID-19
unlike many other countries. Similar perspectives should
be considered for further government policy regarding
progressively reopening the economy and campuses. A
potential future direction is to integrate more aspects
including seasonal effects, which would likely lead to
periodic responses.
Finally, as we write this paper, we note that the
pandemic situation is still evolving with considerable
uncertainty about the future. We believe that this paper demonstrates the importance of nonlinear dynamic
analysis to enhance our understanding of the natural
world in which we the humans live and has profound
implications for the way we handle it in the future.
