Abstract—Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, has
raised a calamitous situation all over the world and has become
one of the most acute and severe ailments in the past hundred
years. The prevalence rate of COVID-19 is rapidly rising every
day throughout the globe. Although no vaccines for this pandemic
have been discovered yet, deep learning techniques proved
themselves to be a powerful tool in the arsenal used by clinicians
for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. This paper aims to
overview the recently developed systems based on deep learning
techniques using different medical imaging modalities like
Computer Tomography (CT) and X-ray. This review specifically
discusses the systems developed for COVID-19 diagnosis using
deep learning techniques and provides insights on well-known
data sets used to train these networks. It also highlights the data
partitioning techniques and various performance measures
developed by researchers in this field. A taxonomy is drawn to
categorize the recent works for proper insight. Finally, we
conclude by addressing the challenges associated with the use of
deep learning methods for COVID-19 detection and probable
future trends in this research area. This paper is intended to
provide experts (medical or otherwise) and technicians with new
insights into the ways deep learning techniques are used in this
regard and how they potentially further works in combatting the
outbreak of COVID-19.

I. INTRODUCTION

N

OVEL coronavirus (COVID-19), resulting from a
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), has become a pandemic worldwide in recent times [1],
[2]. The number of infected cases as well as the death rate is
increasing rapidly. It is reported that about 19,000,000 people
have been infected with COVID-19, the death cases are around
700,000, and the number of recovered patients are around
10,000,000 globally [3]. The universal transmission of COVID19 has put a large amount of the world’s population into
quarantine, and ravaged numerous industrial sectors which in
turn caused a worldwide financial crisis.
The most typical signs of the novel coronavirus include
fever, dry cough, myalgia, dyspnea, and headache [4], [5] but

in some scenarios, no symptoms are visible (asymptomatic) that
make the disease an even bigger threat to public health. The
reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is
considered as the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis [6].
However, the lack of resources and strict test environment
requirements restrict fast and effective screening of suspicious
cases. Furthermore, RT-PCR inspection also experiences high
false negative rates [7]. Unfortunately, the only solution to
effectively combat this transmissible disease, is through clinical
vaccines as well as precise drug/therapy practices, which are
not yet available.
COVID-19 has proven to be amongst the most dangerous
ailments that have posed severe threat to human civilization.
With the evolution of modern technology in the past few
decades, ingenious solutions have been created to assist disease
diagnosis, prevention as well as control which leverage smart
healthcare tools and facilities [8], [9], [10], [11]. Specifically,
for COVID-19 diagnosis, different imaging modalities like CT
and X-ray are considered among the most effective techniques
[12], [13], [14], when available, CT screening is preferred in
comparison with X-rays because of its versatility and threedimensional pulmonary view [15], [16] though X-rays are must
more affordable and widely available. These traditional medical
imaging modalities play a vital role in the control of the
pandemic.
Artificial Intelligence (AI), an evolving software technology
in the area of medical image analysis has also directly helped
combating the novel coronavirus [17], [18], [19] by efficiently
providing high quality diagnosis results and dramatically
reducing or eliminating man power. Very recently, deep
learning and machine learning, two major areas of AI have
become very popular in medical applications. Deep learning
based support systems are developed for COVID-19 diagnosis
using both CT and X-ray samples [20], [21], [22], [23]. Some
of the systems are developed based on pre-trained model with
transfer learning [24], [25] and a few of them are introduced
using customized networks [26], [27], [28]. Machine learning
[29], [30], and data science [31] are also the diverse areas that
are actively used for corona diagnosis, prognosis, prediction,

and the outbreak forecasting. Computer vision [32] has also
contributed for the reduction of the severity of this pandemic.
Moreover, Internet of things (IoT) [33], [34], big data [35], [36],
and smartphone technology [37], [38] are extensively utilized
to enable innovative solutions to fight against the spread of
COVID-19.
The main aim of the paper is to review the recent
developments of deep learning based COVID-19 diagnosis
systems based upon data collected from medical imaging
samples. A taxonomy is presented that classifies the reviewed
systems based on pre-trained model with deep transfer learning
and customized deep learning technique. We review the most
vital schemes developed for the diagnosis of COVID-19
highlighting some aspects such as the data used for
experiments, the data splitting technique, and the evaluation
metrics. An open discussion with the challenges of existing
deep learning based systems as well as a projection of future
works is also presented.
The rest of the paper is as follows. Section II categorizes the
reviewed systems for proper understanding. Section III explains
the recent developed systems for COVID-19 diagnosis from
both CT and X-ray samples using pre-trained model with deep
transfer learning. Section IV demonstrates the custom network
based COVID-19 diagnosis systems from both CT and X-ray.
The discussion with challenges as well as possible future trends
are depicted in section V. Lastly, the paper is concluded in
section VI.
II. TAXONOMY OF DEEP LEARNING BASED COVID-19
DIAGNOSIS SYSTEMS
Deep learning techniques are able to explain complex
problems by learning from simple depictions. The main features
that have made the deep learning methods popular are the
capability of learning the exact representations and the property
of learning the data in a deep manner where multiple layers are
utilized sequentially [39], [40]. Deep learning methods are
widely used in medical systems such as biomedicine [41], smart
healthcare [42], drug discovery [43], medical image analysis
[44], etc.
More recently, it is extensively used in the automated
diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. In general, deep learning
based systems are comprised of several steps such as data
collection, data preparation, feature extraction and
classification, and performance evaluation. The general
pipeline of a COVID-19 diagnosis system based on deep
learning is illustrated in Fig. 1. At the data collection stage, the
patients from the hospital environment are considered as a
participant. The data may have different forms but for COVID19 diagnosis, imaging techniques like CT and X-ray samples
are taken. The following necessary step is the data preparation
that converts the data into an appropriate format. In this step,
data pre-processing includes some operations like noise
removal, resizing, augmentation, and so on. The data
partitioning step splits the data into training, validation, and
testing set for the experiment. Generally, cross-validation
technique is utilized for data partitioning. The training data is
used to develop a particular model that is evaluated by

validation data, and the performance of the developed model is
appraised by test data. The major step of deep learning based
COVID-19 diagnosis is the feature extraction and
classification. In this stage, the deep learning technique
automatically extracts the feature performing several operations
repeatedly, and finally, the classification is done based on class
labels (healthy or COVID-19). Lastly, the developed system is
assessed by some evaluation metrics like accuracy, sensitivity,
specificity, precision, F1-score, and so on.
In this paper, a taxonomy of classifying COVID-19 diagnosis
system is presented to facilitate the navigation of the landscape.
Two different perspectives are applied which are related to the
used deep learning techniques and the used imaging modalities
(see Fig. 2). In this paper, we have reviewed a total of 45
COVID-19 diagnosis systems. Among them, 23 systems
(51.11% of the total reviewed systems) used pre-trained model
for diagnosis purposes and 22 (48.89% of the total reviewed
systems) used custom deep learning techniques for COVID-19
diagnosis. From a different perspective, 25 reviewed systems
used X-ray images (55.55% of the total reviewed systems) as
data source, and the remaining 20 systems utilized CT scans
(44.44% of the total reviewed systems).
III. PRE-TRAINED MODEL WITH DEEP TRANSFER LEARNING
A pre-trained model is one that has already been trained in
fields similar to the context of the application. In transfer
learning, weight and bias are transferred from a large trained
model to a similar new model for testing or retraining. There
are several advantages for using pre-trained models with deep
transfer learning. In general, training a model from scratch for
large dataset requires high computing power and is time
consuming [45], [46]. The pre-trained model with transfer
learning enables the facility to speed up the convergence with
network generalization [47], [48]. Numerous pre-trained
models that are utilized in transfer learning are designed for the
large convolutional neural network (CNN). There are several
pre-trained models which are used for COVID-19 diagnosis
such as AlexNet [49], GoogleNet [50], SqueezeNet [51],
different versions of Visual Geometry Group (VGG) [52],
diverse kinds of ResNet [53], Xception [54], different forms of
inception [55], diverse types of MobileNet [56], DenseNet [57],
U-Net [58], etc. The systems developed for COVID-19
diagnosis are described next.
A. Diagnosis Using Computer Tomography (CT) Images
1) Diagnosis Based on Multiple Source Data
Wu et al. [59] introduced a deep learning based coronavirus
screening framework using the concept of multi-view fusion.
The system used a variant of CNN called ResNet50. The dataset
is collected from two different hospitals in China. A total of 495
images are taken into account for the experiment in which 368
are associated with confirmed COVID-19 cases, and 127 are of
other pneumonia. In this scheme, the dataset is divided into a
proportion of 80%, 10%, and 10% for training, testing, and
validation respectively. Each of the images, considered in the
system are resized into 256×256 before the network
development. In the test case, the developed system obtained

accuracy of 76%, sensitivity of 81.1%, specificity of 61.5%,
and Area under Curve (AUC) of 81.9%. The results are
analysed both for single-view and multi-view fusion model but
the multi-view fusion model demonstrates a superior
performance. In another research, Xu et al. [60] developed a
system for classifying healthy individuals from COVID-19
pneumonia and Influenza-A viral pneumonia utilizing CNN
variants. The used pre-trained model in this system is Resnet18.
The data is collected from three different hospitals in China.
This study considers 618 CT images in which 219 images are
obtained from patients infected with COVID-19, 224 from
Influenza-A viral pneumonia, and 175 from normal individuals.
To train the model, a total of 85.4% (528) images are used, and
the remaining samples are used to test the developed model.
The framework achieved 86.7% accuracy, 81.5% sensitivity,
80.8% precision, and 81.1% F1-score from the experiment.
Afterward, Jin et al. [61] developed an artificial intelligence

based coronavirus diagnosis system using a variant of CNN
named ResNet152. The pre-trained model used 152
convolutional, subsampling, and fully-connected layers. The
used dataset is collected from three renowned hospitals of
China, and two publicly available databases. A total number of
1881 of cases are considered where 496 cases are for COVID19 infected patients, and 1385 are negative cases. The dataset is
split randomly for experiments. The system achieved an
accuracy of 94.98%, sensitivity of 94.06%, specificity of
95.47%, precision of 91.53%, F1-score of 92.78, and AUC of
97.91% from the experiment. Furthermore, Jin et al. [62]
introduced a medical system for COVID-19 screening using
deep learning techniques. Their system used various pre-trained
models of CNN like DPN-92, Inception-v3, ResNet-50, and
Attention ResNet-50 with 3D U-Net++. The dataset is retrieved
from different five hospitals in China. In this system, a total of
139 samples are used where 850 samples from COVID-19, and

4
541 samples from other cases which are considered as negative.
The total data is randomly split into training and testing sets for
performance evaluation. As the evaluation metrics, the system
obtained sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 97.4%, 92.2%,
and 99.1% respectively using 3D Unet++-ResNet-50 which is
considered as the best model. In another research work, Li et al.
[63] demonstrated an automatic system (COVNet) for the
diagnosis of coronavirus from CT images using deep learning
technique which is a variant of CNN named ResNet50. The
used dataset consists of 4536 chest CT samples, including 1296
samples for COVID-19, 1735 for community-acquired
pneumonia (CAP), and 1325 for non-pneumonia. The dataset is
partitioned into training and testing set in a proportion of 90%
and 10% respectively. The experimental result showed that the
system obtained sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 96%, and
AUC of 96% for COVID-19 cases.
Moreover, Javaheri et al. [64] developed a deep learning
approach called CovidCTNet for detecting coronavirus
infection via CT images. The system used BCDU-Net
architecture which is developed based on U-Net. The scheme
distinguished COVID-19 from CAP as well as other lung
disorders. For the experiment, the system used 89,145 CT
images in total where 32,230 CT slices are confirmed with
COVID-19, 25,699 CT slices are confirmed with CAP, and
31,216 CT slices are with healthy lungs or other disorder. The
dataset is partitioned using hold-out method i.e. 90% is used for
training and 10% is utilized for testing. It is obvious from the
experimental results that the developed system obtained
accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUC of 91.66%, 87.5%, 94%,
and 95% respectively. For the proper diagnosis of COVID-19,
Yousefzadeh et al. [65] introduced a deep learning framework
called ai-corona which is worked based on CT images. The
system is comprised of several variants of CNN named
DenseNet, ResNet, Xception, and EfcientNetB0. The used
dataset contained 2124 CT slices in overall where 1418 images
are of non-COVID-19, and 706 slices are of COVID-19
infected cases. The dataset maintained a ratio of 80% and 20%
for training and validation set respectively. The proposed
system found accuracy of 96.4%, sensitivity of 92.4%,
specificity of 98.3%, F1-score of 95.3%, and AUC of 98.9%
from the experiment.
2) Diagnosis Based on Single Source Data
Ardakani et al. [66] proposed a system for the detection of
COVID-19 using ten variants of CNN techniques in CT images.
The used popular variants for diagnosis are AlexNet, VGG-16,
VGG-19, SqueezeNet, GoogleNet, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18,
ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and Xception. In the proposed system,
a total of 1020 CT samples are considered from the cases of
COVID-19 and non-COVID-19. The dataset is split into
training and validation set in a proportion of 80% and 20%
respectively. Among the 10 networks, ResNet-101 and
Xception performed comparatively better than the others. It is
evident from the experimental results that the ResNet-101
model obtained accuracy of 99.51%, sensitivity of 100%, AUC
of 99.4%, and specificity of 99.02%. In other network,
Xception found the accuracy, sensitivity, AUC, and specificity

of 99.02%, 98.04%, 87.3%, and 100% respectively. In another
study, Chen et al. [67] introduced a deep learning based scheme
for the COVID-19 detection of high-resolution CT images
where they used a powerful pre-trained model named UNet++
for detection. Initially, UNet++ extracted valid region in CT
images. In this study, 46,096 images are collected from a
hospital including 51 COVID-19 infected patients and 55
infected with other diseases. Among the dataset, 35,355 images
are selected while eliminating low images using filtering, and
partitioned into training and testing set respectively. Sensitivity
of 94.34%, specificity of 99.16%, accuracy of 98.85%,
precision of 88.37%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of
99.61% are achieved. Further, Cifci [68] presented a scheme for
the early diagnosis of coronavirus using pre-trained models
with deep transfer learning. The pre-trained models are AlexNet
and Inception-V4 which are popular for medical image
analysis. The study is carried out through CT images. To
develop the system, 5800 CT images are retrieved from a public
repository. As a training step, 4640 (80%) CT samples are used,
while 1160 (20%) samples are used for testing. AlexNet
performed comparatively better than Inception-V4 which is
found through experimental results. AlexNet got an overall
accuracy of 94.74% with sensitivity, and specificity of 87.37%,
and 87.45% respectively.
Table I summarizes the aforementioned deep learning based
COVID-19 diagnosis systems from CT samples using pretrained model with deep transfer learning and describes some
of the significant factors, such as data sources, number of
images and classes, data partitioning technique, the used
techniques for diagnosis, and the performance measures of the
developed systems.
B. Diagnosis Using X-ray Images
1) Diagnosis Based on Multiple Source Data
Apostolopoulos and Bessiana [69] developed a system for
the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 cases utilizing the
concept of transfer learning with five variants of CNNs. The
pre-trained models which are used in the system are VGG19,
MobileNetv2, Inception, Xception, and Inception-ResNetv2.
The system considered 1427 images including 224 for COVID19, 700 for common pneumonia, and 504 for healthy cases in
the first scenario. In the second scenario, 224 COVID-19
images, 714 bacterial and viral pneumonia images, and 504
healthy individual images are considered. The dataset was
divided using the 10-fold cross-validation method. It was
revealed that the highest accuracy of 96.78%, sensitivity of
98.66%, and specificity of 96.46% are obtained for the second
dataset using MobileNetv2. In another research work, Loey et
al. [70] introduced a novel system for the diagnosis of
coronavirus using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and
pre-trained models of CNN with deep transfer learning. The
pre-trained models which are used in the proposed system are
Alexnet, Googlenet, and Resnet18. As the number of X-ray
images for COVID-19 is small, GAN is used to generate more
samples for accurate detection of this virus. A total number of
307 images are considered including four classes like COVID19, normal, pneumonia_bac, and pneumonia_vir.

The system experimented on three different scenarios of dataset
depending on the consideration of class level. Considering four
classes, Googlenet obtained the highest accuracy of 80.6%.
Alexnet and Googlenet achieved accuracy of 85.2% and 100%
respectively considering three and two classes.
Horry et al. [75] described a COVID-19 detection framework
using the concept of pre-trained model in X-ray images. The
proposed system used four popular pre-trained models like
VGG, Inception, Xception, and Resnet with transfer learning.
The used dataset consisted of 100 COVID-19 cases, 100
pneumonia, and 200 healthy cases for experiments. In this
system, a ratio of 80:20 is preserved for training and testing set
as a data partition. The experimental findings reveal that the
system obtained precision, sensitivity, and F1-score of 83%,
80%, and 80% respectively using VGG-19 which is measured
as the highest performance in the study considering three-class
data. Further, Ozcan [76] proposed a deep learning scheme with
a combination of the grid search strategy and three pre-trained
models of CNN. The used pre-trained models are GoogleNet,
ResNet18, and ResNet50. The grid search technique is used to
select the best hyperparameter and the pre-trained models are
utilized for feature extraction and classification. The system
used three public datasets where the images are of 242 bacteria
cases, 131 COVID-19 cases, 200 normal cases, and 148 viral
cases. All the data are partitioned into training, testing, and
validation set in a proportion of 50:30:20. The ResNet50 with
grid search performed better and obtained accuracy of 97.69%,
sensitivity of 97.26%, specificity of 97.90%, precision of
95.95%, and F1-score of 96.60%.
Sethy and Behra [77] introduced a system for the diagnosis
of COVID-19 cases using pre-trained models of CNN and
Support Vector Machine (SVM). The algorithm used eleven
CNN pre-trained models for automatic extraction of features,
and SVM for classification. In this system, two separate
datasets were used where the first dataset included 25 positive
COVID-19 and 25 negative X-ray images of COVID-19. A
total of 133 images containing Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS), SARS, and Acute Respiratory Distress
Syndrome (ARDS) are used as positive samples and 133 normal
X-ray images as negative samples in the second dataset. From
the experimental results, it is found that Resnet50 with SVM
obtained accuracy, False Positive Rate (FPR), Matthews
Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and Kappa of 95.38%, 95.52%,
91.41%, and 90.76% respectively which the best is in the
developed system for the first scenario of the dataset. Minaee et
al. [78] proposed a framework named Deep-COVID using the
concept of deep transfer learning for COVID-19 prediction in

X-ray images. Four popular pre-trained models like ResNet18,
ResNet50, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121 were considered in
this study for COVID-19 diagnosis. In total, 5071 images are
collected from different open-access resources. Among them,
2000 images with 31 COVID-19 cases were used for training,
and 3000 images with 40 COVID-19 infected cases were used
for testing in the experiments. The resulting dataset was named
COVID-Xray-5k. The best performance obtained by the system
is sensitivity of 100%, and specificity of 95.6% using
SqueezeNet.
In another study, Punn and Agarwal [79] developed an
automated COVID-19 diagnosis system using several pretrained models like ResNet, Inception-v3, Inception ResNet-v2,
DenseNet169, and NASNetLarge with a small number of X-ray
images. The system used random oversampling and weighted
class loss function for fine-tuning called transfer learning. In
this system, a total of 1076 chest X-ray images are considered
for experiments. The dataset is partitioned into 80%, 10%, and
10% ratio for training, testing, and validation set respectively.
From the experimental results, it was shown that NASNetLarge
performed comparatively better and achieved accuracy,
precision, sensitivity, AUC, specificity, and F1-score of 98%,
88%, 91%, 99%, 98%, and 89% respectively. Afterward, Narin
et al. [80] introduced a method for automatically classifying
COVID-19 infected patients from X-ray images using the
variants of CNN. The pre-trained models used are ResNet50,
InceptionV3, and Inception-ResNetV2 which obtained higher
predictive accuracy on a subset X-ray dataset. The system used
a total of 100 X-ray images where 50 images were from
COVID-19 patients while the remaining 50 from healthy
individuals. The 5-fold cross-validation was used to partition
the dataset for the experiment. The system achieved an
accuracy of 98%, 97%, and 87% from ResNet50, InceptionV3,
and Inception-ResNetV2 respectively in test cases. In terms of
other evaluation metrics, the best performance was obtained
using RecNet50 with a recall of 96%, specificity of 100%,
precision of 100%, and F1-score of 98%.
Bukharia et al. [81] presented a COVID-19 diagnosis system
using a variant of CNN named Resnet50. The system
considered 278 X-ray images of three classes where 89 samples
of COVID-19 infected, 93 samples of healthy participants, and
96 samples of pneumonia patients. The collected dataset was
split into two sets like training and testing in a proportion of
80% (223 images), and 20% (55 images). The diagnosis process
obtained accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 98.18 %,
98.14%, 98.24%, and 98.19 % respectively from the
experiment.

Moreover, Abbas et al. [91] categorized COVID-19 infected
patients, from healthy individuals using Decompose, Transfer,
and Compose (DeTraC) deep ResNet18. The proposed DeTraC
can fix any anomalies in the image dataset by using a class
decomposition method to investigate its class boundaries. In
this system, a total of 196 images were utilized where 80
samples of normal patients, 105 samples of COVID-19, and 11
samples of SARS. The system generated 1764 samples from
given samples using decomposition. The dataset was split into
two groups, 70% for system training and 30% for evaluation.
The proposed system achieved accuracy of 95.12%, sensitivity
of 97.91%, specificity of 91.87%, and precision of 93.36%
using DeTraC-ResNet18 framework.
In another research project, Moutounet-Cartan [94]
developed a deep learning based system to diagnose the novel
coronavirus as well as other pneumonia diseases from X-ray
images. The system used the following variants of CNN
architecture named VGG-16, VGG-19, InceptionResNetV2,
InceptionV3, and Xception for diagnosis. In this study, in total
327 X-ray images were taken where 152 cases were from
healthy people, 125 from COVID-19 cases, and the remaining
50 cases from other pneumonia diseases. The dataset is
partitioned using the principle of 5-fold cross-validation. The
system found VGG-16 as the best performing model and
obtained overall accuracy of 84.1%, sensitivity 87.7%, and
AUC of 97.4% where the sensitivity and AUC were considered
only for COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, Maguolo and Nanni
[95] evaluated the performance of COVID-19 detection system
from X-ray samples utilizing a popular pertained model named
AlexNet. The system used four different publicly available
datasets to evaluate the performance. A total of 339,271 images
were taken where 144 images for COVID-19 patients, 108,948
samples of pneumonia and bacteria except COVID-19, 224,316
chest radiographs of bacteria and pneumonia, and 5,863
paediatric images viral and bacterial pneumonia. The dataset
was partitioned into 10-fold cross-validation for training and

testing. Using the concept of deep transfer learning, the system
obtained the highest AUC of 99.97% in the study.
2) Diagnosis Based on Single Source Data
Very recently, Hemdan et al. [97] proposed a system named
COVIDX-Net to diagnose coronavirus using the variants of
CNN in X-ray images. A total of seven pre-trained models are
considered in this study. The dataset consisted of 50 images
where 25 images are from healthy people and the remaining 25
samples from COVID-19 cases. For the experiment, the dataset
was split into a proportion of 80% and 20% for training and
testing set respectively. The experimental results revealed that
VGG-19 and DenseNet outperformed the other pre-trained
models with an accuracy of 90% and F1-score of 91%.
InceptionV3 obtained the worst results.
Table II summarizes the aforementioned deep learning based
COVID-19 diagnosis systems from X-ray samples using pretrained model with deep transfer learning and describes some
of the significant factors, such as data sources, number of
images and classes, data partitioning technique, the used
techniques for diagnosis, and the performance measures of the
reported systems.
IV. CUSTOM DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES
Custom deep learning techniques provide the ability to
develop a user-friendly architecture and to allow for more
consistent and accurate performance due to the attention to the
specific application of interest. The custom networks are
evolved with the use of a particular deep learning method [98]
or the hybridization of deep learning algorithms [99], [100] or
the hybridization of deep learning with other fields of AI such
as machine learning, data mining, nature-inspired algorithms,
etc. [101], [102]. No previous weights and bias are used in the
customized network like pre-trained model hence it requires
comparatively high computation power and time. The systems
developed for COVID-19 diagnosis are outlined as follows.

9
A. Diagnosis Using Computer Tomography (CT) Images
1) Diagnosis Based on Multiple Source Data
Elghamrawy and Hassanien [103] proposed a scheme for the
diagnosis and prediction of coronavirus infected patients using
a combination of CNN and Whale Optimization Algorithm
(WOA) from CT samples. In the proposed method, CNN is
used for diagnosis, and WOA is utilized for prediction. The
used dataset is collected from publicly available databases
consisted of 617 CT scans. Among them, 134 images are
excluded as it contains non-lung region. A total of 432 images
confirmed of COVID-19 and 151 cases of other viral
pneumonia were considered. To achieve better performance,
the dataset was divided into a proportion of 65%, and 35% for
training and testing respectively. The proposed system obtained
overall accuracy, sensitivity, and precision of 96.40%, 97.25%,
and 97.3% respectively for diagnosis. Further, He et al. [104]
proposed a deep learning method named CRNet for the
detection of COVID-19 using CT images. In this system, a total
of 746 CT images were analysed where 349 were associated
with COVID-19 cases, and 397 with non-COVID-19 cases. The
dataset was formed by merging three publicly available datasets
which was divided into three sets named training, testing, and
validation set in a proportion of 60%, 25%, and 15%
respectively. The proposed system obtained accuracy of 86%,
F1-score of 85%, and AUC of 94% from the experimental
results. In comparison with other prominent pre-trained models,
the proposed system used comparatively less tuning
parameters.
Afterwards, Wang et al. [105] introduced a scheme for
COVID-19 diagnosis using a modified CNN technique named
modified-Inception. The basic difference between Inception
and modified-Inception is that modified-Inception reduces the
dimension of attributes before final classification. In the
experiment, the scheme used 1040 CT images, in which 740
were tagged as COVID-19 positive and 325 as COVID-19
negative. The dataset was partitioned into training, testing, and
validation set randomly. The experimental outcomes revealed
that the scheme achieved accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,
precision, and F1-score of 79.3%, 83%, 67%, 55%, and 63%
respectively on the testing samples. Moreover, Liu et al. [106]
developed an automatic COVID-19 diagnosis system using
deep learning method via CT images. The system used
modified DenseNet-264 (COVIDNet) for diagnosis where the
model consisted of 4 dense blocks. In this system, 920 COVID19 and 1,073 non-COVID-19 cases were considered for the
experiment. To obtain better performance, the dataset is
partitioned into three sets namely training, testing, and
validation in a proportion of 60%, 20%, and 20% respectively.
The developed system obtained accuracy of 94.3%, AUC of
98.6%, sensitivity of 93.1%, specificity of 95.1%, precision of
93.9%, NPV of 94.5%, and F1-score of 93.5%.
In another study , Ying et al. [107] introduced a deep learning
technique based on the Details Relation Extraction neural
network (DRE-Net) named Deep Pneumonia for the diagnosis
of COVID-19 cases utilizing CT images. The dataset was
collected from two popular hospitals in China. In this system,
a total of 1990 image slices were taken where 777 images for

COVID-19, 505 slices for bacterial pneumonia, and 708
samples from normal people. The dataset was split in a
proportion of 60%, 30%, and 10% for training, testing, and
validation set respectively. The proposed system obtained
accuracy of 94%, sensitivity of 93%, precision of 96%, F1score of 94%, and AUC of 99%. To detect COVID-19, Zheng
et al. [108] proposed a 3D deep convolution neural network
(DeCoVNet) from CT scans. The proposed network is
comprised of three segments like a vanilla 3D convolution, a
batch norm layer, and a subsampling layer. The data for the
study was collected from the hospital environment. A total of
630 CT samples were used for experiment where 80% (499
images) were in the training set, and the rest 20% (131images)
were used in testing. From the experimental outcome, accuracy,
sensitivity, specificity, precision, NPV, AUC of 90.1%, 90.7%,
91.1%, 84%, 98.2%, and 95.9% are achieved.
Hasan et al. [109] proposed a hybrid system using the
concept of Q-deformed entropy and deep learning features
(QDE–DF) to differentiate COVID-19 infected people from
pneumonia cases, and healthy people utilizing CT images. For
deep features extraction, CNN and Q-deformed entropy were
used, and LSTM was used to classify the cases from deep
features. A total of 321 chest CT samples were used for this
study, consisting of 118 CT samples of COVID-19 cases, 96
CT samples of pneumonia cases, and 107 CT samples of
healthy individuals. Approximately, 16 attributes were
extracted from each image using a feature extraction technique.
To assess the developed system, the dataset was partitioned in
a proportion of 70%, and 30% for training and testing set
respectively. The system obtained accuracy of 99.68% which is
considered as the highest in this study. Further, Amyar et al.
[110] developed a scheme using deep learning method to
diagnose COVID-19 patients from CT samples. The system
consists of an encoder for reconstruction and two decoders for
segmentation, and for classification purposes, a multi-layer
perceptron is used. The used dataset included 1044 cases where
449 cases were of confirmed COVID-19, 100 cases from
healthy individuals, 98 samples were from confirmed lung
cancer patients, and 397 from various other kinds of pathology.
Collectively, 449 were associated with COVID-19 and 595
were not. The dataset was partitioned into training, validation,
and testing set in a ratio of 80%, 10%, and 10% respectively.
The proposed system received accuracy of 86%, sensitivity of
94%, specificity of 79%, AUC of 93%.
2) Diagnosis Based on Single Source Data
Singh et al. [111] classified COVID-19 infected (positive)
cases from other (negative) cases using deep learning technique
(CNN). In this network, CNN’s initial parameters were tuned
with the application of multi-objective differential evolution
(MODE). A total of 150 CT samples were taken where 75
samples for COVID-19 positive and 75 images for COVID-19
negative. Different variations in training and testing dataset
ratio of 20:80 %, 30:70%, 40:60%, 50:50%, 60:40%, 70:30%,
80:20%, and 90:10%, respectively are taken to conduct the
experiment. The best performed ratio for the proposed system
is 90%, and 10% for training and testing set individually in the

work, Farid et al. [119] introduced a new approach for
classifying COVID-19 infection using the attributes from CT
images. The image parameters were taken using four image

11
filters in mixture with developed hybrid composite extraction
method. The system considered two classes of data named
COVID-19, and SARS, each of the class comprised of 51
images. The dataset was partitioned using 10-fold crossvalidation technique to obtain a better outcome. The developed
system obtained accuracy, precision, f1-score, and AUC of
94.11%, 99.4%, 94%, and 99.4% respectively.
Table III summarizes the aforementioned deep learning
based COVID-19 diagnosis systems from CT samples using
custom deep learning techniques and demonstrates some of the
important factors, such as data sources, number of images and
classes, data partitioning technique, diagnosis techniques, and
the evaluation metrics of the developed systems.
B. Diagnosis Using X-ray Images
1) Diagnosis Based on Multiple Source Data
Ozturk et al. [121] presented a customized network
(DarkCovidNet) for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 in
raw chest X-ray samples utilizing deep neural networks. The
proposed system used DarkNet as a classifier with 17
convolutional layers. In this system, two sources of the dataset
were used which includes 127 images from first sources, and
500 normal and 500 pneumonia cases from frontal X-ray
samples from the second source. The dataset was partitioned in
5-fold cross-validation technique. The obtained sensitivity,
specificity, precision, F1-score, and accuracy of 95.13%,
95.3%, 98.03%, 96.51%, and 98.08% respectively for binaryclass which are the highest in this study. Moreover, Ucar and
Korkmaz [122] developed a COVIDiagnosis-Net based on the
Bayes-SqueezeNet for the diagnosis of coronavirus utilizing Xray samples. The system used 1591 pneumonia cases with nonCOVID-19, 45 COVID-19 cases, and 1203 uninfected normal
patients in total as the dataset. The dataset is formed with the
combination of three publicly available datasets. From the total
data, 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing
are used in the proposed system. The experimental results
obtained accuracy, correctness, completeness, specificity, f1score, and MCC of 98.26%, 98.26%, 98.26%, 99.13%, 98.25%,
and 97.39% individually in overall.
In another study, Wong and Wang [123] developed a
coronavirus detection mechanism from chest x-ray data called
COVID-Net. The system generated a dataset COVIDx by
combining and modifying two open-access datasets. In this
study, the dataset consisted of a total of 13, 800 chest X-ray
samples from 13,645 patients. The system considered three
classes by combining bacterial and viral classes into a negative
case. Among the total data, 90% was used for training and the
rest 10% was utilized for validation. The proposed network
obtained 92.4% accuracy in 10 iterations for test cases, and the
sensitivity and precision of 80% and 88.9% were achieved in
the case of COVID-19 class. Further, Khan et al. [124]
proposed a deep CNN architecture named CoroNet for the
diagnosis of COVID-19 infected patients from chest X-ray
radiographs. In this system, a total of 1300 images were
considered where 290 samples of COVID-19, 660 of bacterial
pneumonia, 931 of viral pneumonia, and 1203 of normal
patients. The dataset was split at a proportion of 80% and 20%

for training and validation set respectively. The proposed
system obtained accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F1-score
of 89.5%, 97%, 100%, and 98% respectively for COVID-19
class.
Recently, Rahimzadeh and Attar [125] proposed a modified
CNN network for the diagnosis of novel coronavirus cases
using X-ray samples. The system concatenated two well-known
architecture of CNN named Xception and ResNet50V2 that
make the system robust using multiple features extraction
capability. Among the 15085 images, 180 were confirmed
COVID-19, 6054 were pneumonia, and 8851 were normal
cases. The scheme used 5-fold cross-validation for data
partitioning. The network obtained accuracy of 99.50%,
sensitivity of 80.53%, specificity of 99.56%, and precision of
35.27% for COVID-19 detection. Furthermore, Mukherjee et
al. [126] proposed a system for the detection of novel
coronavirus using shallow CNN in chest X-ray radiographs.
The developed network is comparatively light-weight due to a
small number of parameters. In this system, 130 positive
COVID-19 cases, and 130 non-COVID cases were considered
where the non-COVID cases include MERS, SARS,
pneumonia, and normal chest X-rays. To obtain better
performance, the dataset was split using 5-fold cross-validation.
The performance of the system was evaluated by tuning the
batch size of the CNN architecture. From the experimental
results, it is found that the system obtained the highest accuracy,
sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1-score, and AUC of
96.92%, 94.20%, 100%, 100%, 97.01%, and 99.22%
respectively for batch size 50.
In another study , Li et al. [127] introduced a robust technique
for automatic COVID-19 screening using discriminative costsensitive learning (DCSL). DCSL is formed with the
combination of fine-grained classification and cost-sensitive
learning. The used dataset consisted of 2,239 chest X-ray
samples where 239 samples of COVID-19 cases, 1,000 samples
from bacterial or viral pneumonia cases, and 1,000 samples of
normal people. To obtain better performance, the dataset was
partitioned using 5-fold cross-validation method. The proposed
system achieved accuracy of 97.01%, precision of 97%,
sensitivity of 97.09%, and F1-score of 96.98%. Khobahi et al.
[128] developed a semi-supervised deep learning system based
on Auto-Encoders named CoroNet to detect COVID-19
infected patients. The proposed system merged three openaccess datasets for experiments. In this scheme, 18,529 images
of different categories were used. Among the images, 99
samples were of COVID-19 classes, 9579 were of non-COVID
pneumonia, and 8851 samples were related to healthy cases.
The dataset was split in a proportion of 90% and 10% for
training and testing set respectively. Overall, the accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1-score of 93.50%, 93.63%, 93.50%, and
93.51% were achieved from the experiment. Moreover, Luz et
al. [130] presented an efficient deep learning scheme named
EfficientNet for the detection of coronavirus pattern from X-ray
radiographs. The main advantage of EfficientNet is that it used
fewer parameters, approximately 30 times less parameters than
the pre-trained model. The system considered 30,663 images
for experiment where 183 cases considered as COVID-19,

2) Diagnosis Based on Single Source Data
Alqudah et al. [131] suggested a hybrid method for the
diagnosis of patients affected with coronavirus from X-ray data.
The proposed system combined deep learning (CNN) and
machine learning (SVM, RF) architecture. Deep learning was
utilized both for feature extraction and classification task where
machine learning was only used for classification task. In the
system, 71 X-ray images of the chest were used in total
where 48 are used for positive and 23 for negative. The system
used 70% for training and 30% for testing and experiments
were performed on several combinations like CNN-Softmax,
CNN-SVM, and CNN-RF. The system obtained accuracy,
sensitivity, specificity, and precision of 95.2%, 93.3%, 100%,
and 100% respectively for CNN-Softmax classifier. Afterward,
Farooq and Hafeez [132] presented a deep learning scheme with
a pre-trained ResNet-50 network to detect the COVID-19
infected patients named COVID-ResNet. The proposed system
implemented a residual neural network with 50 layers in total.
In this study, the dataset comprised of 13,800 chest X-ray
samples from 13,645 patients in total. The system achieved
accuracy of 96.23% overall with 41 iterations using the
COVIDx dataset. The other evaluation metrics like sensitivity,
precision, and F1-score of 100%, 100%, and 100% are obtained
considering the COVID-19 case only. Further, Afshar et al.
[133] developed a capsule network based system named
COVID-CAPS for the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients using
X-ray samples. The proposed framework is well suited to work
with a small dataset. The dataset used in the network was the
COVIDx dataset, which is popular for COVID-19 research. The
developed scheme used 13,800 chest x-ray images from 13,645
patients for experiments. Although there are four classes in the
dataset, the system classifies the images into three classes
considering bacterial and viral into one negative class. COVIDCAPS obtained accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of
95.7%, 90%, 95.8%, and 0.97 respectively.
Table IV summarizes the aforementioned deep learning
based COVID-19 diagnosis systems from X-ray samples using
custom deep learning techniques and demonstrates some of the
important factors, such as data sources, number of images and
classes, data partitioning technique, diagnosis techniques, and

the evaluation metrics of the developed systems.
V. OPEN DISCUSSIONS, CHALLENGES AND FUTURE TRENDS
This section demonstrates the discussions of reviewed
systems, challenges, and the possible future trends of deep
learning based systems for COVID-19 diagnosis.
A. Open Discussions
In this paper, 45 systems were reviewed where 23 systems
used pre-trained model as a deep learning architecture, and the
remaining 22 utilized custom deep learning framework. The
results of the individual system are presented for explanation.
Two popular imaging techniques CT and X-ray are used for
data samples. Among the reviewed system, 25 systems are
developed based on X-ray data and the rest 20 used CT samples.
The majority of the systems used multiple source data and a few
of them used single source data. We summarized the developed
systems considering some features like the data sources, the
number of images and classes, the data partitioning techniques,
the used deep learning technique for diagnosis, and finally the
evaluation metrics for performance measure. The data sources
are the benchmark dataset or real-time data from hospital
environment. Some of the systems used a huge number of
images but the number of samples for COVID-19 cases is
comparatively small. Both the binary and multi-class are
considered throughout the review. With respect to data
partitioning, some of the systems used cross-validation
techniques, and others used hold-out method. Both the pretrained model and custom deep learning architecture are taken
into consideration. Almost all the systems used CNN or variants
of CNN for diagnosis. Some common evaluation metrics like
accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1-score, AUC, etc.
are utilized through the whole review.
The summary for the CT scan based COVID-19 diagnosis
utilizing pre-trained model as well as customized deep learning
technique is illustrated in Table I and Table III. It is evident
from the results that most of the developed systems used realtime data from hospital environment of China and a few of the
systems [61], [64], [103], [104], [109], [110], [111], and [119]
used benchmark data. A few of the developed systems [66],
[67], [68], [111], and [119] used data from a single source and
the majority of the developed schemes used multiple source
data. The datasets which are used multiple times in the reviewed
systems are COVID-CT [112], and COVID-19 [113]. The

14
reviewed systems which used maximum and minimum number
of images for the experiment are [64], and [119] where the
COVID-19 cases are of 32,230 (augmented data), and 51
respectively. In case of the number of classes to be classified,
most of the developed systems considered binary class
(COVID-19, and non-COVID-19) while some of them [60],
[63], [64], [107], and [109] considered multiple classes
(COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal). The 10-fold [119] was
taken into consideration in some cases, whereas some
developed systems [61], [62], [67], and [105] used random
partitioning, and the majority of them considered hold-out
method for data splitting. As far as performance is concerned,
the system developed in [66] obtained 100% sensitivity. Among
the reviewed systems, most of the frameworks [61], [62], [63],
[65], [66], [103], [106], [107], [109] achieved comparatively
higher accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1-score and
AUC having these measure (where applicable) greater than
90%. The highest accuracy of 99.51% and 99.68% were found
at [66], [119] using pre-trained model and customized network
respectively.
Table II and Table IV depict the X-ray based diagnosis of
COVID-19 using pre-trained model with deep transfer learning
and customized deep learning architecture. Our analysis
revealed that almost all the developed systems used a common
dataset COVID-19 X-ray image database [82]. Some systems
used Kermany et al. [84] dataset, and COVIDx Dataset [123]
frequently for diagnosis. All the proposed schemes utilized
benchmark data for the experiment, no system applied real-time
data. The systems introduced in [97], [131], [132], and [133]
used single source data whereas the rest of the reviewed systems
considered data from multiple sources. The framework
demonstrated in [95] considered the highest number of images
where the lowest case was used in [97]. The number of COVID19 cases for [95], and [97] is 144, and 25 respectively. Although
some systems considered the maximum number of images but
the total number of images for COVID-19 is comparatively
small. In terms of number of class consideration, some of the
systems [70], [76], [124], and [131] considered 4 classes, a few
of them [69], [75], [79], [81], [91], [94], etc. used 3 classes, and
the remaining reviewed systems utilized binary class for
experiment. The cross-validation technique such as 10-fold
[69], [95], and 5-fold [80], [94], [121], [125], [126], [127] are
used in some cases, and other systems considered hold-out
method for data partitioning. In case of performance measure
of the developed systems, 100% accuracy was achieved by the
proposed systems in [70], 100% sensitivity in [70], [78], [97],
[124], and [132], 100% specificity in [80], [97], [126], and
[131], 100% precision in [70], [80], [97], [126], [130], [131],
and [132], 100% F1-score [70], and [132], 100% AUC obtained
in [80]. Most of the developed systems performed better in case
of precision measurement, and the second best is obtained in
case of sensitivity. Though the reviewed systems achieved
comparatively better results for X-ray case both for pre-trained
and custom network, the developed systems are not real-time
tested with target people.
In comparing the pre-trained model with the custom network,
some of the reviewed systems performed better for custom

network. The performance of the developed systems varied
depending on the dataset. The performance of the reviewed
systems is not comparable as almost all the systems used
different data sizes for the experiment. In terms of imaging
modalities comparison, X-ray based systems performed
comparatively better than CT based systems. But most of the
X-ray based frameworks used benchmark data while the realtime data from hospital environment is considered in case of CT
based systems. It is envisaged that the systems introduced using
CT samples are applicable for real-time testing but the X-ray
based proposed schemes need real-time testing with target
people before application
B. Challenges and Future Trends
There are many unique challenges for applying deep
learning techniques and algorithms for the detection of novel
coronavirus (COVID-19).
While deep learning techniques are highly automatable, it
needs a large set of data to develop a robust system for diagnosis
purpose. As the COVID-19 is very new to research, the lack of
standard data is a major challenge for diagnosis. On the other
hand, the available imaging data for COVID-19 patients are
incomplete, noisy, ambiguous, and inaccurate labels in some
cases. To train a deep learning architecture with such massive
and diverse data sets is very complex and there is a need to
resolve a variety of problems like data redundancy, sparsity as
well as missing values. Almost all the reviewed systems used
different data sets for the experiment. The developed systems
collected data from internet sources, prepared the data in their
way, and finally evaluated their systems using evaluation
metrics. For this reason, it is quite difficult to conclude
definitively which system yields the best result for COVID-19
detection.
The further challenges for the COVID-19 detection systems
are the imbalance in the dataset samples. It is a critical issue as
there are a few COVID-19 samples both CT and X-ray whereas
pneumonia and normal cases contain a huge number of samples
than COVID-19 cases. It is evident from the reviewed systems
proposed in [61], [62], [78], [95], etc. The imbalance in data
very often raises bias during the training phase of deep learning
technique. With the fewer number of positive samples, it has
become increasingly difficult to balance out the target sample.
The lack of confidence interval is another challenge found in
deep learning based COVID-19 diagnosis systems. Deep
learning architecture provides the output as prediction
confidence whereas the output indicator of a particular neuron
is considered as a single probability. For COVID-19 diagnosis,
the lack of confidence interval across a predicted value is
usually not desirable.
To overcome these challenges, researches may consider the
design of optimized deep learning algorithms that can easily
cope up with a small number of data [26]. A shallow long shortterm memory (LSTM) [134] is utilized to solve the limitations
of a small dataset. In the absence of large-scale training
datasets, leveraging the current deep learning architecture as
feature extractors and then conducting more learning on those
attributes using end to end manner [135], [136] is a more

15
encouraging path. Freezing is a technique that provides the
facilities to shrink the number of parameters in deep learning
architecture where the reduced parameters are hired from
another network trained for similar purposes. While the number
of parameters would reduce, it might be possible to achieve
good performance from a small number of COVID-19 cases
[137], [138]. Ensemble learning [139], [140], and multi-task
learning [110], [141] are better suited for COVID-19 diagnosis
in the context of a small number of data. In case of ensemble
learning, multiple architectures are developed instead of a
single network and finally, the results of each network are
combined. In multi-task architecture, diverse tasks are
combined to take the facility of data annotations from one
another.
Additionally, synthetic data generation might be a possible
solution to overcome the challenges of deep learning based
COVID-19 detection systems. The most used techniques for
data generation are data augmentation and GANs which are
frequently utilized to solve the class imbalance problem. The
data augmentation technique [142], [143] generate new lesions
from the given COVID-19 samples using flipping, rotation,
cropping, random noise addition, etc. from the given images.
But the overfitting problem may arise in case of augmented
data. GANs are the most sophisticated techniques for realistic
synthetic data generation. From a small number of COVID-19
samples, GANs [70], [144] generate a large number of images
that are used to train a deep learning system for the novel virus
diagnosis. Further, weakly supervised deep learning methods
[145], [146] would be a probable solution for limited training
data. Furthermore, as the manually labeling of COVID-19
imaging data is costly, and lengthy process, the use of selfsupervised deep learning techniques [147], [148] are highly
recommended.

that the role of physicians or clinicians in clinical diagnosis can
be replaced by deep learning techniques. In the near future, it is
hoped that deep learning experts with radiologists would provide
appropriate support systems for identifying the COVID-19
infected patients.

VI. CONCLUSION

[14]

The COVID-19 is still an ongoing pandemic that is creating
new records in terms of cumulative and daily numbers for global
infection and death. Deep learning based automatic diagnosis of
COVID-19 which provides consistent and accurate solutions, has
played a significant role to assist with the diagnosis of this
disease. This paper presents the recent works for COVID-19
diagnosis purposes using deep learning techniques from two
types of imaging techniques like CT and X-ray samples. The
review describes the systems which are developed based on pretrained model with deep transfer learning and customized deep
learning architecture for COVID-19 diagnosis. Two-leveled
taxonomy was presented which explores the perspectives of deep
learning techniques and imaging modalities. This paper outlines
all the sources of used datasets which can be easily understood
and accessed by the research community. The major challenge of
the COVID-19 diagnosis systems based on deep learning is the
lack of gold standard. Furthermore, the possible solutions to
overcome the current challenges are recommended that might
encourage the researchers who would like to contribute in this
area. It is prudent to note that the deep learning techniques with
imaging modalities offer only partial details about the infected
patients. However, it is not really envisaged in the present state
