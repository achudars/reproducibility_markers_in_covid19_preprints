We isolate a nano-colloidal droplet of surrogate mucosalivary fluid to gain fundamental insights into
the infectivity of air borne nuclei and viral load distribution during the Covid-19 pandemic. Saltwater
solution containing particles at reported viral loads are acoustically trapped in contactless environment
to emulate the drying, flow and precipitation dynamics of real airborne droplets. Observations with the
surrogate fluid are validated by similar experiments with actual samples from a healthy human subject.
A unique feature emerges with regards to the final crystallite dimension; it is always 20-30% of the
initial droplet diameter for different sizes and ambient conditions. Airborne-precipitates nearly enclose
the complete viral load within its bulk while the substrate precipitates exhibit a high percentage (~8090%) of exposed virions (depending on the surface). The letter demonstrates the leveraging of an inert
nano-colloidal system to gain insights into an equivalent biological system.
Humans routinely eject pulsatile jets containing microdroplets

during sneezing, coughing or even

talking, which aid in rapid transport of viral loads leading to pandemics such as the Covid-194,5. Such
droplets remain airborne for considerable amount of time, given the initial size and ambient conditions,
and evaporate to form infective nuclei6.. Chaudhuri et al7 elucidated the mechanics by which droplet
initiates and propagates a pandemic by combining models of droplet evaporation, aerodynamics and
SIR7. Given the size distribution of respiratory droplets8, the airborne nuclei have a high probability of
assimilation via oral or nasal passage. They might also deposit on objects of daily use to form fomites
which can subsequently be assimilated by a person via touch. Although the infectivity of a given
droplet-nuclei/fomite is linked to the initial viral load9,10 as well its stability in different
environments11,12,13, it is equally important to understand the desiccation and the precipitation dynamics
of the infected droplet. The general practice is to study the viral activity in cellular environments14 under
diffusion effects 15,16 where the precipitation dynamics are not very important. On the other hand, droplet
embodies a plethora of fluidic transport17,18 and couples precipitation and evaporation of droplet to the
agglomeration dynamics of the virions with the cellular material to which it is attached. Given the
complexity of the experiment with actual viruses in respiratory fluid, such studies have been rarely
attempted20. Mucosalivary fluids are known to have dissolved salts (~1 wt.%) in addition to mucus and
enzymes19,20. This letter uses dissolved NaCl in de-ionised water at 1 wt% as a simple surrogate liquid.
Inactive nanoparticles of polystyrene (mean size 100 nm) are added to this saline solution to emulate
virus particle of similar size (CoV-2, Influenza)21 Although having different mechanical and chemical

properties, nanoparticles shed important insights into the transport and precipitation role of virions
inside an airborne droplet. Viral loads occur in the range of 106-109 per ml of the respiratory fluid22
which translates into an approximate initial nanoparticles load of φnp ~ 0.0001 (in wt. % unless stated
otherwise) in the given saline solution. However, precipitation dynamics at higher loads23 presents a
fundamental insight into nanoparticles interaction at high electrolyte concentration24 as well as a crucial
premise for several other applications25. To this end, φnp would also be varied from 0.01 to 0.1 for further
investigation.
Given the experimental complexity associated with studying a mobile air-borne droplet, we have used
an acoustic levitator to trap a droplet in the air (tec5) and allowed it to evaporate in a controlled
ambience (T∞=28+0.2 °C, RH∞=41+2%). Acoustic levitation26 has been extensively used to study the
evaporation27 and precipitation dynamics of a solute laden droplet25,28,29,30. A droplet of the surrogate
fluid having an initial diameter D0=550 μm+10 μm is inserted into one of the stable nodes of the acoustic
levitator and imaged every 3 seconds at 30 frames per second (see S1 of Supporting Information) till
3

the end of evaporation. The effective diameter of the droplet 𝐷 = √𝑑𝑥2 𝑑𝑦 where dx and dy are the major
and minor axis of the droplet, respectively. Figure 1b shows the lifetime of evaporation. The droplet
monotonically reduces till the time instant t=tI where the shrinkage appears arrested. Subsequently, the
shape of the droplet deviates from its initial sphericity (dx/dy=1) at t=tII and finally assumes its crystalline
form at t=tIII shown for different concentrations of nanoparticles.

Figure 1 Evaporation dynamics of a levitated droplet. (a) Sequential snapshots show the reduction of
droplet diameter culminating into the final precipitate shown for different values of nanoparticle
concentration (φnp in wt.%). Time instant tI indicates the end of evaporation dominated stage when the rate

of diameter reduction reduces sufficiently. Time instant tII indicates the departure from sphericity of the
droplet. The time instant tIII indicates the end of the process. The scale bar is 0.2 mm. (b) The droplet
diameter is plotted as D/D0 vs. time (t) pure water, salt-water (1 wt. %) and salt-water+nanoparticles(np)
where the mean concentration of the range φnp=0.01-0.1 is used. The mean value of D0=550+10 µm. Error
bars are standard deviations of multiple runs. (c) Aspect ratio of the droplet (dx/dy) vs. t for the same
conditions as (b) where dx and dy refer to the major and the minor axis of the droplet respectively. (d)
Variation in tI vs. φnp for both surrogate and HS. (e) Comparison of tII for both surrogate and HS. The onset
of efflorescence (teff) for different φnp is also plotted. Ambient temperature is set at 28+0.2 °C and the RH is
set at 41+2%.

The diameter reduction of the surrogate fluid (salt-water +nanoparticle) is plotted in Figure 1b. Since
the presence of nanoparticles till φnp=0.1 shows no distinctive effect on the reduction of the dimeter,
only the mean concentration (φnp=0.05) is plotted (Figure 1b). The initial stage of evaporation is
diffusion limited27, fits the standard D2 law which states that31 𝐷(𝑡)2 = 𝐷02 − 𝐾𝑒 𝑡. The value of Ke~O
(10-9) m2/s for a pure water droplets and predicts the total lifetime to be 𝑡𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑝 =

𝐷02⁄
𝐾𝑒 ≈ 300 s, which

is close to observed values (Figure 1b). Initial droplet reduction rates are nearly equal for water and
surrogate fluid but start deviating at t>200 s (inset of Figure 1b) due to the presence of dissolved salt
which reduces the vapour pressure droplet25. This is consistent with the evaporation-precipitation model
presented in Chaudhuri et al7. The deviation between the surrogate and HS droplets originates in the
complex composition of the later (mucus, surfactants, polyelectrolytes, etc) as well as inherent
inhomogenity in the sample due to collection methodology. Nonetheless, the D/D0 appears to follow a
similar trend at an offset rate and exhibits similar phenomenology.
The end of evaporation dominated phase occurs at t=tI when the diameter shrinkage dramatically
reduces leading to a knee like appearance (see Figure 1b). However, solvent loss, though slower,
continues till tIII. The knee-transition occurs at t=tI=260~300 s for the surrogate droplet and tI=380 s for
the HS droplet as shown in Figure 1d. The knee formation is universally observed for both HS and at
0.2~0.3D0 as corroborated from experiments with different initial droplet sizes (300 to 800 μm),
temperature range (27-30 °C) and RH (40%-50%) (see S2; Supporting Information). The onset of knee
is independent of φnp which de-couples viral loading effect on the precipitation dynamics within the
respiratory droplet. The distribution of nanoparticles within the droplet bulk can be predicted from the

Pem>>1, the nanoparticles do not diffuse but accumulate near the receding interface of the droplet24,29.

The droplet shape evolves under evaporation and departs from its initial sphericity as shown by the plot
of (dx/dy) at t=tII (Figure 1c). The transition can be predicted as follows. The Peclet number for a levitated
saline droplet32 is 𝑃𝑒 =

Pe<1 indicates homogenous distribution of salt allowing the use of droplet volume to estimate its bulk
concentration in the droplet. At a time t=teff corresponding to D/D0<0.26, the efflorescence limit (640
g/l)34 is achieved within the bulk of the droplet. The close match between tII and teff is shown in Figure
1e proving the near coincidence of efflorescence and shape flattening. The HS droplet flattens at an
early stage possibly due to the naturally occurring surfactants and the acoustic pressure19,35and
transitions at tII,HS~370 s. Thus, the evaporation and the precipitation dynamics of the surrogate droplet
closely match the HS droplet based on the timescales tI and tII. The proposed timescales are well
predicted from the evaporation model7 and simple bulk concentration calculations, indicate the advent
of crystallization in saline or HS droplets and applicable toa wide range of droplet size and ambient
conditions. Given the absence of particle loading effect on evaporation and precipitation dynamics, only
the case of φnp=0 is used to discuss the role of acoustic streaming on crystallization.

Figure 2 Flow visualization in case of φnp=0 is displayed as superposition of three consecutive images (3/2000
s) for φnp=0 for (i) D/D0=1 (ii) D/D0=0.8 and (iii) D/D0=0.7. The scale bar in red is 0.2 mm. (b) The
progression of precipitation in φnp=0 is laser visualized and presented at (i) D/D0=0.27 (ii) D/D0=0.26,
interval (iii) D/D0=0.24 (iv) D/D0=0.2 (v) final crystalline form. (c) Front illuminated droplet shape for φnp=0
is shown at (i) D/D0=0.25 (ii) Spherical top-half and crystalline bottom half (iii) final crystalline form. The
scale bar in blue is 50 μm.

Acoustic streaming around the droplet governs the internal flow field26 and is visualized by adding 0.86
μm particles of latex (1.05 g/cc) at an initial concentration of 0.008 % wt. Illumination is done using a

laser beam of 1 mm at 0.2 W (see S1 Supporting Information). The time averaged flow field in Figure
2a shows a circulatory motion within the droplet, where a fluid particle near its surface moves at a mean
rate of 0.087+0.02 m/s. This homogenizes the salt molecules in the azimuthal direction (but not in the
radial direction where it diffuses). The flow magnitude and direction agrees with previous studies of
particle image velocimetry in evaporating levitated droplets and remains nearly constant throughout the
droplet lifetime36 as observed from Figures 2a(ii and iii). Note that an ejected respiratory droplet is
accompanied by a jet and subjected to atmospheric turbulence leading to similar rotatory motions3
which is recreated in this case due to the acoustic streaming and torque provided by the levitator26.
Laser scatter in absence of 860 nm particles aid in visualizing the onset of precipitation. The scatter
from the droplet is sampled at a rate of 50 fps (for details see S1; Supplementary Information). Images
are bandpass filtered to enhance the precipitation induced scatter within the droplet. At
D/D0=0.26~0.27, scatter from the centre of the droplet may indicate the onset of precipitation (Figure
2b (i and ii)) which coincides with efflorescence as previously discussed. At D/D0=0.24, the droplet
interior shows uniform scatter (Figure 2b(iii)) while the departure from sphericity occurs at D/D0=0.2
(Figure 2b(iv)) which shows an even higher uniformity in scatter. Although, spatial inception of
efflorescence is difficult to identify, a drastic shape change could be observed when the bulk has
crystallized as seen from the time lapse between Figure 2b (i-iv). The final cuboidal shape of NaCl37 is
observed from Figure 2b(v) at a time tIII=320~330 s. The shape evolution is better visualized using front
illumination (see S1 of Supporting Information) as shown in Figure 2c. The spherical shape in Figure
2c(i) transforms into a dual structure where the lower half has crystallized before the upper half (Figure
2c(ii)). Saha et al23 attribute this to an unequal pressure distribution at the north and the south poles.
Consequently, the salt distribution accumulates faster in the lower half of the droplet leading to earlier
crystallization. The final cuboidal shape in Figure 2c(iii) is consistent with Figure 2b(v) but maybe
different from those observed from salt precipitation in the atmosphere due to absence of acoustic
pressure field. The rate of crystal growth can be estimated as

µm/s. The final crystal

dimensions are similar for various nanoparticle loadings (Figure 3a).
The timescales in evaporation and precipitation dynamics is established in the preceding discussions.
The morphological similarity between the various precipitates of different compositions (φnp) (Figure
3a) further demonstrates the independence of precipitation from particle loading rates. To scrutinize the
distribution of nanoparticles (emulated viral loading) upon precipitation, marker nanoparticles with
fluorescent label (R100, Thermofisher) are loaded into the levitated droplet at φnp =0.0001. Precipitation
will entrap the nanoparticles in the levitated precipitate (Figure 3b(i)) similar to the entrapment of
virions in desiccated airborne droplets. Here z is along the levitator’s axis. The preserved levitated
precipitate is observed under in fluorescence mode (BX51, Olympus) with a 100x objective (depth of
focus ~2.5 µm) at different depths (interval of 3-5 µm). The surface layer in Figure 3b(ii) shows discrete

bright spots corresponding to groups of nanoparticles. The image also conveys sparse distribution of
nanoparticles. A typical section of the precipitate bulk (Figure 3b(iii) displays diffuse emission from
multiple layers, possibly due to higher concentration of particles. Using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), the surface of the same precipitate shown in Figure 3b(ii and iii) is presented in Figure 3b(v).
Particles trapped near the upper layers of the precipitate are scanty and appear partially exposed (not
stacked as multilayers) as shown in Figure 3b(v). In absence of particle loading, the surface topography
of the precipitate is very smooth as shown in Figure 3b(iv). Thus, loaded particles/virions in levitated
samples tend to be embedded mostly within the bulk.

While levitated droplets emulate small sized droplets which completely desiccate in air, larger droplets
settle to form fomites. Droplets, of same volume and particle loading as the levitated droplets, were
dried on steel and glass surfaces. The value of Pe >>1 for the sessile case, imply that salt particles will
accumulate near the droplet’s contact line (Fig. 4a(i)-b(i)). Here, the velocity scale was evaluated based

f(θ) =0.27θ2+1.3 and the initial value of contact

angle θ (~20° on glass and 60° on steel)18. Fluorescence images are acquired within the perimeter of the
surface precipitate where the signal from the substrate corresponds to the exposed nanoparticles (Fig.
4b(ii-iii), 4c(ii-iii)). The integrated intensity from the substrate is denoted as Isubstrate (Fig. 4b(ii), 4c(ii))
while the same from the crystal is Ibulk (Fig. 4b(iii), 4c(iii). The fraction of particles exposed on the
surface is simply 𝐼 =

∑ 𝐼𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒
𝐼𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙

where Itotal= Isubstrate +Ibulk. Since the given volume of droplet contains

n~8 x106 particles, the average number of particles at the surface is nexp=nI. On glass, nexp~ 5x106 while
in case of steel substrates, nexp~ 7x106. The variation in the numbers between steel and glass is due to
the affinity of the substrate-particle interaction39 as well as the internal flow structure40. Nonetheless,
precipitates in fomites indeed show a greater percentage of exposed particles (~ 80-90%) on the
substrates as compared to embedded in crystals as in air-borne counterparts. The Probabilistic Analysis
for National Threats Hazards and Risks (PANTHR) database41 predicts the virus lifetime to be
significantly shorter (~100 times) in air-borne precipitates when compared to those on solid surfaces.

This correlates to the presented experimental findings that the virions are more exposed in dried settled
droplets as opposed to their airborne counterparts.
In summary, a nanocolloidal system is successfully used to mimic the evaporation and precipitation
dynamics of an isolated mucosalivary droplet. Theoretical and experimental arguments are presented
to show how the evaporation leads to salt crystallization which traps the virion-substitutes at different
layers of the air-borne precipitate. Fluorescent microscopy correlates the lower survival rates of virus
in the air-borne precipitates to its lower number of exposed virions.
