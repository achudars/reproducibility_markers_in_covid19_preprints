ABSTRACT
We develop a simple 3-dimensional iterative map model to forecast the global spread of the coronavirus disease. Our model
contains at most two fitting parameters, which we determine from the data supplied by the world health organisation for the
total number of cases and new cases each day. We find that our model provides a surprisingly good fit to the currently-available
data, which exhibits a cross-over from exponential to power-law growth, as lock-down measures begin to take effect. Before
these measures, our model predicts exponential growth from day 30 to 69, starting from the date on which the world health
organisation provided the first ‘Situation report’ (21 January 2020 – day 1). Based on this initial data the disease may be
expected to infect approximately 23% of the global population, i.e. about 1.76 billion people, taking approximately 83 million
lives. Under this scenario, the global number of new cases is predicted to peak on day 133 (about the middle of May 2020),
with an estimated 60 million new cases per day. If current lock-down measures can be maintained, our model predicts power
law growth from day 69 onward. Such growth is comparatively slow and would have to continue for several decades before a
sufficient number of people (at least 23% of the global population) have developed immunity to the disease through being
infected. Lock-down measures appear to be very effective in postponing the unimaginably large peak in the daily number of
new cases that would occur in the absence of any interventions. However, should these measure be relaxed, the spread of
the disease will most likely revert back to its original exponential growth pattern. As such, the duration and severity of the
lock-down measures should be carefully timed against their potentially devastating impact on the world economy.

Introduction
On 11 March 2020, the world health organisation (WHO) characterised the 2019 outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
as a pandemic, referring to its prevalence throughout the whole world1 . The outbreak started as a pneumonia of an unknown
cause, which was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China. It was reported as such to the WHO on the 31st December 2019,
and has since reached epidemic proportions within China, where it has infected more than 80 000 citizens, to date. During
the first six weeks of 2020 the disease spread to more than 140 other countries, creating wide-spread political and economic
turmoil, due to unprecedented levels of spread and severity.
The rapid spread of COVID-19 is fuelled by the fact that the majority of infected people do not experience severe symptoms,
thus making it more likely for them to remain mobile, and hence to infect others2 . At the same time the disease can be lethal to
some members of the population, having a globally averaged fatality ratio of about 6%, at present (16 April 2020). Furthermore
the new virus seems capable of surviving for unusually long periods on plastic and metal surfaces, which are both, frequently
encountered in everyday life. Detailed analysis of the virus also revealed that its outer surface consists of club-like “spikes” that
are about four times more effective at establishing the infection than in the closely related coronavirus that causes severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-20033 . It is most likely this particular combination of traits that has made the COVID-19
outbreak one of the largest in recorded history.
While there are a number of models available for the global spread of infectious diseases4 , some even containing very
sophisticated traffic layers5 , relatively few researchers are making use of simpler models that can provide the big picture without
being difficult to interpret unambiguously. In the latter category of relatively simple models we could find only a discrete
epidemic model for SARS6 , and more recently, a comparison of the logistic growth and susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)
models for COVID-197 .
In our present work we develop a simple discrete 3-dimensional iterative map model, which shares some similarities with
the classic SIR model. We show that our model can fit both the initial exponential growth in the number of cases, before
lock-down measures began to take effect (about day 69), as well as subsequent power-law growth. In our view the current
interventions are necessary to prevent the unimaginably fast (exponential) spread of the disease until some solution (perhaps in
the form of a vaccine) can be developed.

Results
Simple model
As a simple exponential growth model for the global data we initially develop a 3-dimensional iterative map model given by
xi+1

= xi + αyi (z0 − xi ) /z0

yi+1

= αyi (z0 − xi ) /z0

zi+1

= zi − cyi ,

(1)

where xi is the total number of confirmed cases, yi is the number of new cases and zi is the global population, on any given day
i. We denote the only fitting parameter by α, while c is a fixed parameter equal to the fraction of people who have died from the
disease. According to the latest available global data from the WHO (see the last row of Table 1 in Methods ), c = 0.06343.
We briefly describe the physical content of Eqs. (1). The first equation simply updates the total number of cases by setting it
equal to the previous total number of cases, plus the number of new cases. Here the factor of 1/z0 has been introduced for
convenience, to ensure that the proportionality constant α remains close to unity. In the second equation see that the number of
new cases is assumed to be proportional to the previous number of new cases multiplied by the previous number of susceptible
people. For simplicity we assume here the the number of susceptible people are all those who have not yet had the disease. The
third equation is merely to keep track of the global population, by subtracting the estimated number of people who have died
each day, based on the fraction c.
We have found that our simple model provides a very good fit to the global data between the 29th and 70th days of the
pandemic. By using Levenberg–Marquardt (least squares) optimisation8 (see Methods), we find α = 1.1393, for the initial
condition x30 = 75194.3 y30 = 349.477 and z30 = z0 = 7.7000 × 109 .
Figure 1 shows a comparison of the data with the model, as well as a forecast made up to the 200th day. As we see in

Figure 1. A comparison of the data with Eqs. (1). (a) Close up view of the extent to which the model fits the global data for
the total number of confirmed cases xi and new cases yi , so far. (b) A forecast of how the disease is likely to spread globally, up
to the 200th day, i.e. 7 August 2020. As the inset shows, the peak number of new infections is predicted to occur on day 133
(19 May 2020), when about 60 million new cases may be expected.
Figure 1(a), the model provides a good fit to the data between the 29th and 70th days, having a correlation coefficient (R-squared
value) of 0.99432 or higher (see Table 1). The forecast made in Figure 1(b) (corresponding to the 69th ’Last day’ in Table 1),
predicts that approximately a quarter of the worlds population, i.e. ≈ 1.76/7.7 = 0.23, would have had COVID-19 by the 200th
day. The peak of the pandemic is expected to occur on day 133, when about 60 million daily new cases can be expected. We
also predict that by the beginning of August 2020, hardly any new cases should occur; however, the total number of lives lost by
then could be as high as 83 million, i.e. a number which is almost the same as the global population increase for the year 20199 .
In Table 1 we see that the fitting parameter α, and hence the predictions made by the model, do change somewhat as more
of the available data is used in the fitting procedure. To see the variation in α more clearly we have plotted the first and second
columns of Table 1 in Figure 2. It shows that, as more data is used, there seems to be a general upward trend in α, until the 69th

Table 1. Variation in the predictions made by the model using only data up to and including the ’Last day’, as indicated in the
first column. The predicted total number of ’Deaths’ indicated in column 6 is equal to z30 − z200 , i.e. the difference between the
initial population and the remaining population on day 200.

’Last day’. Beyond this our ’Simple model’ no longer provides a good fit to the data, as is evident from the rapidly declining
R-squared values that are given in the far right column of the Table.
In Figure 2 we also plot (blue solid line) the mean value ᾱ = 1.1389 over ’Last day’ 66-69. The value of α is essentially
constant over these four days.

Figure 2. Variation of the fitting parameter α as more and more of the available data is used in the fitting procedure. We see
that the value of α reaches its maximum on ’Last day’ 69. The average value of α over ’Last day’ 66-69 is given by
ᾱ = 1.1389.

Transition from exponential to power-law growth
China is currently the only country in which the rapid further spread of the virus appears to be under control. An investigation
of the data for China observed that the total number of infections as well as the number of recoveries and the number of
deaths followed a power law growth, rather than growing exponentially10, 11 . A wider study for 25 different countries found
that other countries also showed scale free power law growth behaviour with different country-specific scaling exponents12 .
Subsequent in-depth analysis of more available data of country-specific growth behaviours revealed, however, that different
countries exhibit generally different growth behaviours13 . It was found that while indeed some countries such as for example
the Netherlands or Norway exhibit a power law behaviour over nearly the whole range of the available data, other countries
such as for example the US or France display long periods of very few infections followed by a massive exponential surge
but subsequently quickly reduce the growth rate again: a behaviour that is clearly not describable by a power law. In general,
however, the spread of the disease within individual countries initially appears to be exponential, followed by power law growth
once national lock-down measures take effect. We may therefore expect a similar trend in the global data, which is more or less
what we observe from day 70 onward. Note that day 70 corresponds to the 30th of March 2020, which is two to three weeks
after many of the hardest hit European countries implemented their national lock-downs: Italy (10 March), Spain (14 March),
France (17 March), etc.
One can rationalise the transition from exponential to power law growth as follows. Any person living his/her life in the city
has on any given day a large number of contacts with people and infectious objects. Of these interactions, relatively few can be
classified as relations that are of particular meaning to that individual, such as contact with a spouse, children, friends, family
relations, coworkers, etc. Thus most contacts are completely random interactions, such as through public transport, contacts
with clients, public parks, shops, entertainment facilities, etc. For the spread of the virus it is irrelevant whether the susceptible
person’s interaction with another individual is meaningful or random, as long as the virus can be transmitted.
Since random interactions are generally never with the same people or infectious objects, they generally give rise to an
exponential spread of the disease. The introduction of governmental measures, such as a ’lock-down’, severely reduce random
interactions whilst leaving more open the possibility of relationship interactions. Human societies (friendships, relations,
collaborations, social networks etc.) have been found to be organised in small world or scale-free networks14, 15 exhibiting
power law behaviours. Given that the further spreading of the epidemic is now effectively being restricted, on a global scale,
to only those relation networks, it follows that the global spread pattern should also change from exponential to a power law
growth, as has been shown in countries such as China, the Netherlands, Norway and others.
In light of this expectation we have expanded our original simple model to reflect the change of the growth behaviour after
world wide governmentally instituted lock-down measures have started to take effect, i.e.on about day 69, according to the
global data.
Improved model
As described in Methods we have derived an improved model which can take into account both exponential and power law
growth. This model is given by

where there are now two fitting parameters, a and b.
Equation (2) is more general than (1). In the limit, a >> max{y0i }, it reduces to the same form as equation (1), since the
a
exponential factor essentially becomes independent of y0i , i.e. a/(y0i + a) −
→ 1 and, by comparison to equation (1), α = exp (b).
∞
The main advantage of equation (2) is that it can take into account the observed cross-over from exponential growth during
the initial phase of the pandemic, to a power law growth, now that measures to curb the spread are starting to take effect on a
global scale.
Since our ’Improved model’ can take into account the effects of the interventions put in place to curb the global spread of
the virus, we were expecting it to provide a more optimistic forecast than that of our ’Simple model’. However, although our
’Improved model’ does predict a vast reduction in the daily number of new cases, it also predicts a prolonged spread of the
disease, as long as the interventions are strictly enforced. This is shown by the green curve in Figure 3. The problem however
is that this type of power-law growth is in fact so gradual, that it would have to be maintained for several decades before a
significant number of the population become immune to the disease, i.e. as a result of having contracted the virus. At the same

Figure 3. A comparison of the forecasts given by the ’Simple’ (red and blue curves) and ’Improved’ (green and black curves)
models. With the ’Improved’ model (Eqn. (2) with the fitting parameters a = 85710 and b = 0.23756) we find that the growth
in the number of cases increases according to a power law with exponent less than 1. However, should all lock-down measures
be lifted on day 100 (i.e. the by the end of April 2020), one can expect the growth to revert back to its original exponential
behaviour (Eqn. (1) with α = 1.1393).

time, should the stringency of the interventions be relaxed at any time, the spread will revert to its original exponential growth
behaviour, implying that the spread of the disease could quickly get out of hand, again and again. In Figure 3 we assume,
for example, that all restrictions are lifted at the end of April (day 100), giving rise to the exponential increase shown by the
red curve. The blue curve shows the daily number of new cases undergoes hardly any reduction in its maximum peak height,
though its peak is shifted forward by about a month, in comparison to the forecast given in Figure 1.

Discussion
One can of course try to answer more specific questions with more sophisticated models, like the discrete model we mentioned
for SARS6 ; however, here we have been more interested in developing a very simple model that brushes over the details and
only captures the essential, large scale behaviour.
As we have seen, there are essentially two possible behaviours: either the virus can proceed naturally, leading to exponential
growth in the number of cases; or else its progression can be slowed down to a more manageable power-law growth, i.e. for
as long as the present, stringent, lock-down measures can be imposed. But for how long will it be necessary (or possible) to
impose the present measures? On the near horizon there does not seem to be any easy answer to this question, nor is there any
clear solution to the pandemic itself. A vaccine is unlikely to be developed for several months, and there seems to be only a
remote possibility that the virus may mutate naturally into something less lethal to humans.
The direct human cost of an unchecked (exponential) spread of the virus could be truly devastating16 . On the one hand,
it could result in a catastrophic loss of tens of millions of lives, as our model predicts, but on the other hand it will end the
pandemic once and for all. The current measures, leading to more manageable power-law growth, come at a very high economic
cost and are therefore not sustainable for much longer. So far these measures have included enforced quarantine, which has
led to a severe slowdown in economic activity and manufacturing production, principally due to declining consumption and
disrupted global supply chains17 . (As an example of the severity of the slowdown in production, several major car manufacturers
are gradually halting production in major manufacturing hubs throughout the developed world18 .) This decline, coupled with
the associated economic uncertainty, has had knock on effects in the form of historically unprecedented stock market falls19 .
Although the stock market is more of an indicator of the future value of the profits of listed corporations, their collapsed share
prices could trigger severe financial crises because of a spike in bankruptcies. (The debt of US corporations is the highest it has
ever been20 .) The inevitable loss of jobs will also lead to an inability to pay bills and mortgages, increased levels of crime, etc.
In principle, such a major decline in economic conditions could also result in an equally large-scale loss of life/livelihoods,
albeit over a more prolonged period of time.

Table 2. Data used for the Levenberg–Marquardt (least squares) optimisation of the parameter α in Eqs. 1. The columns
contain the day since the first situation report (21 January 2020), the total number of cases (column 2), the number of new cases
(column 3), and the total number of deaths (column 4).

Python script for fitting the parameters
For the reader’s convenience, the complete python script for the optimisation of the single parameter α of the simple model is
provided on the following page. In this script, the function leastsq(), imported from the module scipy.optimize22 ,
uses Levenberg–Marquardt optimization to minimize the residual vector returned by the function ef(). The function
leastsq() is called from within main(), which reads in the data and sets up the initial parameter and the other two
quantities (the initial values x[0] and y[0]) for optimisation. These three quantities are then passed to leastsq(), via the
vector v0.
For the data in Table 2, the output from the script should be:
R-squared = 0.99432
alpha = 1.1393
x[29] = 75194.3
y[29] = 349.477
z[29] = 7700000000.0
The python scripts that were used to produce the Figures and Table 1 in this paper are available from the corresponding author
upon request.

Improved model equations
The form of the equations in our improved model was motivated by a Taylor series expansion of the power law
y (t) = at b ,

(3)

where a and b are real positive constants. For convenience we first take the natural logarithm on both sides of (3),
ln y (t) = ln a + b ln (t) .

(4)

For ∆t  t, we then expand about t, to get
ln y (t + ∆t) = ln a + b ln (t + ∆t)
∆t 1
≈ ln a + b lnt + −

Subtracting (4) from (5) produces, to leading order in ∆t/t,

From (4) we also see that

After substituting (8) into (6), and taking the exponential on both sides of the resulting equation, we arrive at


y (t + ∆t) ≈ y (t) exp b∆t
y (t)
In terms of an iterative map the power law growth given by (9) suggests the form

1 !

yi+1 = yi exp b
yi + a

(8)

(9)

(10)

where we have put ∆t = 1 and added a shift in the denominator (yi → yi + a) for convenience. This shift allows the iterative
map model to change smoothly from pure exponential growth (yi << a), to something that approximates power law growth for
values of yi that become comparable to a. Note that, because of the latter approximation, the (now) fitting parameter b is no
longer equal to the power indicated by b in Eqn. (3).
