Abstract
The sudden onset of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has resulted in tremendous loss of human
life and economy in more than 210 countries and territories around the world. While self-protections such
as wearing masks, sheltering in place and quarantine policies and strategies are necessary for containing
virus transmission, tens of millions of people in the U.S. have lost their jobs due to the shutdown of
businesses. Therefore, how to reopen the economy safely while the virus is still circulating in population
has become a problem of significant concern and importance to elected leaders and business executives.
In this study, mathematical modeling is employed to quantify the profit generation and the infection risk
simultaneously from the point of view of a business entity. Specifically, an ordinary differential equation
model was developed to characterize disease transmission and infection risk. An algebraic equation is
proposed to determine the net profit that a business entity can generate after reopening and take into
account the costs associated of several protection/quarantine guidelines. All model parameters were
calibrated based on various data and information sources. Sensitivity analyses and case studies were
performed to illustrate the use of the model in practice.

Introduction
Severe Acute respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) is an ongoing global health threat to
every country in the world and has caused significant loss of almost every business entity.1-3 In the United
States alone, as of May 14, 2020, more than 1.3 million confirmed infections and more than 84,000
deaths had been reported since the COVID-19 outbreak, which is associated with a 4.8% drop in gross
domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter of 2020. While the development of effective vaccination,
treatment and prevention strategies is underway, it is still unknown when such efforts will yield clinical
and medical practices effective enough to allow a return to usual economic activity.4,5 Practicing a variety
of stringent quarantine and shutdown policies is an effective way to protect our citizens’ health and lives
during a pandemic like SARS-CoV-2.6 However, there are costs that need to be considered. Besides the
extraordinary physical and emotional stress and potentially significant medical expenses that COVID
patients and their families must cope with, a large number of people have lost (or may lose) their jobs or
businesses. This significant financial loss results in a pressure to reopen the economy prior to the
availability of effective vaccination and treatment of COVID-19. Elected leaders and business executives
as well as employees must address a critical question: how to reopen the economy in the midst of a
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic safely?
In this study, we use mathematical modeling techniques to address particular challenges a business entity
may face during reopening. In recognition that mathematical modeling results alone cannot stop
pandemics,7 the following behavioral and social guidelines are still strongly suggested for any business
entities in planning to reopen:
1. Social distancing (including dinning in restaurants and manufacturing in factories), e.g., the
number of workers (and clients or patrons) that a business environment can support while
maintaining a 6ft distance between individuals;
2. Mask, glove, and goggle wearing while not alone;
3. Routine sanitization (e.g., entrance, exit, home, workplace, conference room, bathroom, public
transportation, door knobs, shared electronic devices);
4. COVID-19 tests accessible to workers who have symptoms or recent exposure to confirmed
infections;
5. Deployment of non-contact sensors (e.g., Kinsa smart thermometer) for real-time fever detection
and location;
6. Case reporting and quarantine policy;
7. Determination of a maximum time duration of exposure to working environment;
8. Specific equipment (e.g., stronger ventilation system, UV purification system) for aerosol
transmission prevention;
9. Employees in non-contact positions remain working from home;
The implementation of each guideline above can protect employees’ health and lives but may add an
economical cost. Indeed, the main purpose of reopening businesses is to prevent further deterioration of
our economy by generating profits and provide incomes that many citizens desperately need. However,
for employees in a contact-based position, the risk of COVID infection and transmission may remarkably
increase if they return to work. When the infection rate of COVID-19 within a business entity becomes
higher than the prevalence in the general population, it may trigger a domino effect and subsequent
infections in a broader community originated from this business entity. Therefore, a delicate balance
between profit/income generation and infection/transmission prevention must be the ideal. The focus of
this modeling strategy is to provide a quantitative tool for investigating whether a business entity can
generate positive net profit after reopening while keeping the prevalence of COVID-19 infection within
2

this entity less than or equal to the prevalence in the general population. The prevalence in the general
population is assumed to remain under a certain threshold after reopening; otherwise, isolation and
quarantine orders may be re-issued by government and reopening would halt.

Materials and Methods
Mathematical Model
To our knowledge, there exist only a few studies that have modeled the reopening of a country, a state, a
city or a local community,8-11 and fewer studies have focused on the reopening of a business entity. This
modeling work attempts to address the business-reopening problem by considering a transmission model
together with a net profit equation.
Borrowing from the classical susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) modeling framework as in several
previous models,8,12 the following definitions and notations are introduced. Let 𝑁𝑁𝑇𝑇 denote the total
number of employees in a business entity, 𝑁𝑁𝑐𝑐 denote the number of employees in a contact-based
position, and 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 denote the number of employees in a non-contact position. Employees in a non-contact
position are expected to remain working from home (WFH) according to Guideline #9 and thus are
excluded from the transmission model. These WFH employees still actively contribute to profit
generation and are counted in the net profit equation. In addition, the total number of employees 𝑁𝑁𝑇𝑇 is
assumed variable after the reopening due to various reasons, including infection-related death or other
factors. Among the 𝑁𝑁𝑐𝑐 employees in a contact-based position, let 𝑆𝑆 denote the number of susceptible
employees; 𝐶𝐶 denote the number of asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and very-mildly-symptomatic
(VMS) carriers (collectively known as silent spreaders); 𝑄𝑄 denote the number of infected employees on
quarantine, under treatment (i.e., confirmed infection) or awaiting test result (i.e., unconfirmed infection);
and 𝐷𝐷 denote the number of deaths or resignations due to infection. Note that: i) all infected employees
confirmed by virus tests should be quarantined immediately, and any company fellow having a recent
contact with the infected person is assumed to also be tested for the virus and initially be self-quarantined
(see Guideline #4). The asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and very-mildly-symptomatic carriers are the
three major categories of the so-called “silent spreaders”.13 While it remains unclear how quickly
asymptomatic carriers can transmit the infection, some studies in China (ref) suggested that
approximately 25% of those who tested positive without symptoms continued symptomless, and the
remaining 75% turned out to be pre-symptomatic.14 Other ongoing studies suggested that the proportion
of asymptomatic infection could be as high as 50%.15 People with very mild symptoms (e.g., occasional
light cough or mild fever) may not recognize the infection but are also fully capable of spreading the
disease like the presymptomatic carriers.16 Finally, the WFH employees may still be infected and then
practice at-home quarantine or receive treatment in hospital; for simplicity, instead of introducing another
set of equations for characterizing the WFH transmission, the number of infected WFH employees 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 is
assumed to be collected by the business entity on a self-reported basis and directly accounted for in the
net profit calculation equation.

After taking silent spreaders into consideration,17 the proposed model structure is given below:

and the net profit is defined as the following:
𝑃𝑃𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 = 𝜉𝜉1 ∙ 𝜉𝜉7 ∙ 𝜌𝜌 ∙ �(𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 − 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 ) + 𝑆𝑆 + 𝐶𝐶 + 𝑅𝑅� − ∑𝑖𝑖≠1or 7 𝜉𝜉𝑖𝑖 ∙ (𝑆𝑆 + 𝐶𝐶 + 𝑅𝑅) − 𝑤𝑤 ∙ 𝑄𝑄 − 𝑤𝑤 ∙ 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 ,

(6)

where 𝑁𝑁 = 𝑆𝑆 + 𝐶𝐶 + 𝑅𝑅 denotes the number of employees in contact-based positions who are working on
site. The definitions of all model variables and parameters are listed in Table 1, and a diagram (Fig. 1) is
also given to illustrate the transmission model mechanisms and assumptions. As suggested in Fig. 1 and
Eq. (1), susceptible employees can be infected and become virus carriers by contacting people outside of
the business at a rate 𝛽𝛽𝑂𝑂 , or interacting with asymptomatic carriers within the business at a rate 𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴 and
with presymptomatic and VMS carriers within the business at a rate 𝛽𝛽𝑃𝑃 . Also, 𝛼𝛼 denotes the proportion of
asymptomatic carriers among all tested-positive infections, and 𝜅𝜅 denote the probability of transmission
via an average number of contacts per day of one person with other persons. In Eq. (2), the infected
susceptible become asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic or VMS carriers, and those pre-symptomatic and
VMS carriers further progress to symptomatic infections at a rate 𝜏𝜏. In Eq. (3), symptomatic infections
may recover at a rate 𝛾𝛾 and become immune to virus infection due to, e.g., memory immunity,18 regress to
symptomless carriers (e.g., some patients can test positive and shed viruses after symptoms end19) at a rate
𝜔𝜔, or die at a rate 𝛿𝛿. Also, Eqns. (4) and (5) characterize the dynamics of recovered and death,
respectively. In the net profit Eq. (6), 𝜌𝜌 denotes the net profit per day generated by healthy WFH,
susceptible, and silent carrier employees, 𝜉𝜉𝑖𝑖 (𝑖𝑖 ≠ 1,7) is the average cost per person per day in a contactbased position associated with the 𝑖𝑖-th protection Guideline (𝑖𝑖 = 1, … ,9), and 𝑤𝑤 is the average wage per
day per person for employees on quarantine or under treatment. It is assumed that employees on
quarantine or under treatment still receive their wages given that the typical quarantine or treatment
length is 14-28 days even considering them as sick days.

Data Source and Parameter Values
The datasets generated from recently published studies and surveys are heterogeneous in terms of
population demographics, geospatial characteristics, medical resource availability, treatment regimens,
prevention polices and implementation, among others. Extraordinary efforts are needed to integrate such
heterogeneous datasets and perform a variety of statistical analyses, which is beyond the scope of this
study. Instead, the summary statistics or previously-calibrated parameter values from previous studies and
surveys are used as the primary information sources for our model parameter calibration. Note that studies
reported different accuracy (in terms of decimals), it is thus difficult to standardize the number of
decimals without losing accuracy so we keep the original numbers.
To calibrate the transmission model parameters in Eq. (1)-(5), we started with the case death rate and the
recovery time. In the United States, the case fatality rate is currently 5.65% while Omer et al. (2020) 20
previously estimated the infection-related death rate as low as 1.7%. In other countries, the reported case
death rates may range from 0.56% (Iceland) to 13.53% (Italy);20-22 to preserve parameter uncertainty, this
wide range is adopted in our calculations. To calculate the mean recovery time, we consider the following
observations:23 i) 8 out of 10 infected persons with symptoms have only mild illness; ii) the average
recovery time for mild cases is about 2 weeks; iii) for severe cases, recovery may take up to 6 weeks; iv)
4

the overall recovery rate is between 97% and 99.75%. The conservative mean recovery time for all cases

is thus 1/[�

= 16.65 days among people with symptomatic infections, which is longer

than the reported median hospitalization period of 12 days 24 among survivors. It was also reported that
the recovery time for mild cases can be as short as 7 days, therefore, this study assumes that recovery time
ranges from 7 to 42 days.25

In Eq. (1), for the proportion of asymptomatic carriers (denoted by α), multiple studies have been
conducted to estimate this parameter among different populations with different methods.15,26-29 The range
of the estimate of 𝛼𝛼� is (13.8%, 75%), and about half of such studies reported a result around 50%. Sun et
al. (2020) 26 analyzed 391 cases in Zhejiang Province, China from Jan. 20th, 2020 to Feb. 10th, 2020, and
found 54 (13.8%) cases were asymptomatic. Nishiura et al. (2020) 29 estimated α in the evacuated
Japanese citizens to be 30.8% (95% CI: 7.7-53.8%). Mizumoto et al. (2020) 15 obtained an estimate
17.9% (95% CI: 15.5-20.2 %) using the data from the Diamond Princess cruise. Kimball et al. (2020) 28
analyzed the results of symptom assessment and SARS-CoV-2 testing in King County, Washington, and
found that 56.5% of the tested positive was asymptomatic. Day (2020) 27 suggested that the proportion of
asymptomatic infection was between 50% and 75% in northern Italy, and others 30 suggested that 𝛼𝛼 could
be between 25% and 50% on Apr. 5th, 2020.31

Furthermore, κ is the probability of one employee having contacts with infected carriers outside a
business entity, and βO denotes the associated transmission rate. A limited number of studies were found
helpful for estimating these two parameters, we thus calibrated such parameter values primarily using the
simulation results from Tang et al. (2020).32 In Tang’s study, the daily average contact number was
estimated to be 14.78 (SE 0.90) contacts per day per person, and the probability of successful
transmission per contact was estimated to be 2.10 × 10−8 (SE 1.19 × 10−9). According to the definitions
of κ and βO , we have βO · κ = 14.78 × 2.10 × 10−8 = 3.10 × 10−7 day −1 , and the range of βO · κ,
(2.42 × 10−7 , 3.88 × 10−7), can be calculated using the standard errors (i.e., 2.42 × 10−7 = (14.78 −
2 × 0.90) × (2.10 × 10−8 − 2 × 1.19 × 10−9 ), and 3.88 × 10−7 = (14.78 + 2 × 0.90) × (2.10 ×
10−8 + 2 × 1.19 × 10−9 ).

The transmission rate (βP ) can be calculated from 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟
, where 𝑅𝑅0 denotes the reproduction

number (i.e., the average number of new infections by one carrier) that has been frequently investigated in
many SARS-CoV-2 studies.14,32-41 For instance, according to the study of Liu et al. (2020),42 the estimated
𝑅𝑅0 of SARS-CoV-2 in China at the early stage of the pandemic ranges from 1.4 to 6.49 with a mean 3.28
and a median 2.79. Note that the population in Liu et al. (2020) was mostly not aware of the pandemic
and used little protections such as mask wearing, hand washing and social distancing. Thus, for the
unprotected general population, the estimated transmission rate is 3.28/16.65= 0.197 day −1. The
corresponding range is between 0.0333 (=1.4/42) and 0.927 (=6.49/7) per day. Note that in the early stage
of a pandemic, it can be assumed that most of the cases are pre-symptomatic or mildly-symptomatic such
that the parameter value calculated above may be close to the true value of βP . Another study by Li et al.
(2020)43 suggested that the transmission rate βP could be 1.12 (95% CI: 1.07-1.18), 0.52 (95% CI: 0.420.72), or 0.35 (95% CI: 0.28-0.45) per day by fitting data of different pandemic stages in China. For these
reasons, we assumed a range for βP of (0.0333, 1.18) per day.
For the transmission rate of asymptomatic infection (βA ), very little useful information was found in the
scientific literature. Here we borrowed the idea of Li ‘s work,43 in which the transmission rate of
asymptomatic infection was calculated by multiplying a reduction factor µ with the transmission rate of
symptomatic infection. The reduction factor µ was estimated as 0.55 (95% CI: 0.46-0.62), 0.50 (95% CI:

5

0.37- 0.69) and 0.43 (95% CI: 0.31, 0.61), corresponding to different stages of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in
China. Using the same reduction factor µ in our model, βA can be estimated by μβp , leading to a mean of
0.197 × 0.5 = 0.099 per day and a range from 0.0103 (= 0.333 × 0.31) to 0.814 (= 1.18 × 0.69) per
day.
In Eq. (2), τ is the rate of silent carriers progressing to symptomatic infections. The mean incubation
period was previously reported to be 5.2 days with a 95% confidence interval (4.1, 7.0) days,14,44 or 5.1
days with a 95% confidence interval (2.2, 11.5) days.45 Based on these results, we estimated 𝜏𝜏 as the
reciprocal of the incubation period with a mean 1/5.2=0.192 per day and a 95% confidence interval
(0.143, 0.244) per day.

In Eq. (3), for the clearance rate of symptomatic infection 𝛾𝛾 and the death rate due to COVID infection 𝛿𝛿,
multiple studies developed various methods to estimate them.6,32,46 In Piguillem’s method,6 the
calculations were mainly based on the case mortality rate and the recovery time. After substituting 16.65
days for the mean recovery time and 5.65% for the mean death rate aforementioned, we obtain the
estimate of 𝛾𝛾 as (1 − 0.0565)2 /16.65 =0.0535 per day, and the death rate 𝛿𝛿 as (1 − 0.0565) ×
0.0565
16.65

=0.0032 per day. The range of 𝛾𝛾 is found to be (0.0178, 0.141) per day, and the range of δ is

(1.3 × 10−4 , 1.67 × 10−2) per day.

In Eq. (2) and (3), we also introduced 𝜔𝜔, the rate of regression to carriage, considering the fact that 3.23%
of the patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested positive after hospital discharge.47,48
However, the potential infectivity of these carriers remains unclear. Here 𝜔𝜔 is estimated to be 3.23%
× 𝛾𝛾�=0.0323×0.0535= 0.00173 per day, and its range is between 0.000575 (=0.0178 × 3.23%) and
0.00455 (=0.141×3.23%) per day.

Now consider the additional parameters in the net-profit equation Eq. (6). The average net profit per
capita 𝜌𝜌 in the U.S. is found to be $400.73 per person per day, which is calculated by dividing Jan 2020
U.S. corporate profit $1908.02 Billion US dollars 49 by 158,714,000 (the number of employed persons in
the United States)50 and then by 30 days. The average weekly wage of one employee in the U.S. is $1,093
per person in the third quarter of Year 2019,51 so the average daily wage of employee 𝑤𝑤 is $218.60 per
day (dividing $1,109 by the number of weekdays 5). In the previous study of Thumstrom and Newbold
(2020),12 GDP loss was considered as one cost of social distancing; i.e., an immediate GDP decline
associated with practicing social distancing alone (i.e., house-hold quarantine) in the United States was
predicted to be 13.7 − 6.49 = 7.21 trillion US dollars. The projected GDP of Fiscal Year 2020 is 22.11
trillion US dollars according to the United States Congressional Budget Office (CBO).52 Therefore, for
Guideline #1, the cost of social distancing is the loss of productivity by 7.21 ÷ 22.11 = 32.6%, and thus
𝜉𝜉1 = 1 − 32.6% = 67.4%. For Guideline #2, the cost of personal protective equipment (PPE),53
including surgical mask, gloves, goggle wearing, hand sanitization, and soup, is calculated as 𝜉𝜉2 =$3.60
per person per day 54 under the assumption that each person will consume two surgical masks per day,
two pairs of gloves per day, and one goggles. According to the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
guideline from Perdue University,55 goggles can last for years if kept clean by using mild soap and water,
and if stored in a protected, dry, and temperate storage location. So the use life of goggles is much longer
than our typical setting for simulation time window length (i.e., 100 days) and the cost of one goggles per
day is $5 ÷ 100 = $0.05 per day for simplicity. The detailed costs of each PPE item as well as hand
sanitization and soap can be found from online resources.56,57 For Guideline #3, the cost of routine
sanitization (e.g., cleaning the workplace, bathroom, and shared electronic devices) is calculated as 𝜉𝜉3 =
$10.45 per environmental service staff per day.58 Specifically, in the work of White (2019), 11 hospitals
6

with a total of 1,700 environmental service staffs, they found to spend $11,308 per week to maintain the
hygiene by consuming disinfection products. We thus calculate 𝜉𝜉3 using the following equation:
𝜉𝜉3 =

𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝

For Guideline #4, the current policy dictates that the test of COVID is free to the business entity (𝜉𝜉4 =
$0 per person per day). For Guideline #5, as the current market prices of a non-contact sensor may
range from $50 to $100, and one non-contact sensor is required for each worksite. With the assumption of
having 100 employees per worksite, the cost of deploying non-contact sensor 𝜉𝜉5 is $0.005 to $0.01 per
person per day for a 100-day time horizon. We assume that Guideline #6 does not cost any money (𝜉𝜉6 =
$0 per person per day). For Guideline #7, the cost is proportional to the current maximum working hours
(i.e., 𝜉𝜉7 =

𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜
).
𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜

In our model, the current maximum working hours is assumed

to be 70% of the regular working hours. For Guideline #8, referring to the work of Chen (2013),54 the
cost of deploying specific equipment for reducing aerosol transmission such as ultraviolet germicidal
irradiation (UVGI) and high-efficiency particular air (HEPA) filtration are $182.37 and $136.78 per
person per year, respectively, 𝜉𝜉8 is thus equal to $0.874 per person per day via dividing the total cost of
the aforementioned equipment by 365 days. Finally, we assume that implementing Guideline #9 does not
incur any cost (𝜉𝜉9 = $0 per person per day).

All the parameter definitions, values and ranges are summarized in Table 1. However, it should be
stressed that the parameter values calibrated above are for heterogeneous populations. More importantly,
at the early stage of the pandemic, the estimates of certain transmission model parameters (e.g., the
reproduction number and transmission rates) are expected to be larger due to the absence of protection
policies and self-protection awareness; and the transmission rates are expected to have a notable drop
after the implementation of various protection and quarantine strategies (PQS). Such a hypothesis is
supported by several recent studies, which showed that the overall transmission rates may decrease by 2.1
to 3.2 fold after implementing PQS. Also, the study of Seto et al. (2003) 59 quantified the odds ratios of
SARS infection as 13 (95% CI: 3, 60), 2 (95% CI: 0.6, 7), or 5 (95% CI: 1, 19), corresponding to the use
of masks, gloves or hand-washing, respectively. Thus, the values of certain model parameters (e.g.,
transmission rates) will be different from (e.g., smaller than) the values calibrated in this section after
implementing Guidelines #1-9, which will be elaborated in the result Section.

Implementation and Computing Configuration
All the computing codes were implemented in MATLAB® (MathWorks, Natick, MA), and the ordinary
differential equation (ODE) solver ode15s was employed for solving the transmission model numerically.
The relative error tolerance was set at 10−7, the absolute error tolerance at 10−7, and the maximum step
size at 10−2.

Results
Sensitivity Analysis

7

We evaluated the local sensitivity of the transmission model in Eq. (1)-(5). Specifically, we evaluated the
changes in the model outcome variables (i.e. S, C, Q, R, D) corresponding to a 1% change in one
parameter value, with the other seven parameter values fixed at their default values as in Table 1. Initial
values for the sensitivity analysis were set as 299 susceptible and 1 silent carrier which approximated the
proportion of infections in the U.S. general population as reported by May 5, 2020. The initial numbers of
quarantined, recovered, and death were all set as 0 for simplicity. The results were visualized in Figure
2a, showing that the transmission model was most sensitive to the transmission rate of pre-symptomatic
and VMS infections (𝛽𝛽𝑃𝑃 ) and the rate of progression to symptomatic infection (𝜏𝜏), and least sensitive to
the product 𝛽𝛽𝑂𝑂 ∙ 𝜅𝜅. Even for the most sensitive parameters, a 1% change in parameters 𝛽𝛽𝑃𝑃 or 𝜏𝜏 resulted in
a change of less than 5 persons per day in the outcomes throughout a prediction period of 200 days. At the
end of the 200 days period, all changes in the outcomes reached a plateau or tended to diminish. The
percentage changes in the model outcomes corresponding to 1% change in each parameter value are
shown in Figure 2b. One percent change in 𝛽𝛽𝑃𝑃 or 𝜏𝜏 corresponded to less than 1.5% change in the
outcomes. These observations together suggested that the transmission model was not locally sensitive to
parameter value changes and could make robust predictions.
To evaluate the global sensitivity of this model, the Partial Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient
(PRCC) method 60 was employed. The model parameters were randomly sampled 100 times using the
Latin hypercube sampling technique over uniform distribution. The range of the uniform distribution for
the global sensitivity for each model parameter is reported in Table 1. Figure 3, shows the plot of the
PRCC values (next to the y axis in the figure) between model parameters and ODE outputs against time.
As suggested in many previous studies, an absolute PRCC value greater than 0.4 was deemed as
practically significant.61 For the susceptible population (𝑆𝑆), the corresponding subfigure showed that the
transmission rates 𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴 and 𝛽𝛽𝑃𝑃 were strongly and negatively (< −0.7) correlated with 𝑆𝑆. This result was
expected as the higher the transmission rates, the smaller the number of the susceptible persons. Please
note that the percentage of asymptomatic carriers (𝛼𝛼) was positively correlated with 𝑆𝑆 initially (> 0.4) and
then became negatively correlated with 𝑆𝑆 at the end (< −0.6). The initial positive correlation between 𝑆𝑆
and 𝛼𝛼 should not be interpreted as that 𝑆𝑆 will increase when 𝛼𝛼 increases, but that 𝑆𝑆 will decrease less
when 𝛼𝛼 increases. This will happen when 𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴 ∙ 𝛼𝛼 is less than 𝛽𝛽𝑃𝑃 ∙ (1 − 𝛼𝛼). Around the end of the time
window of the simulation, a larger 𝛼𝛼 corresponded to a smaller 𝑁𝑁 = 𝑆𝑆 + 𝐶𝐶 + 𝑅𝑅 due to the increase in
death, and thus 𝑆𝑆 will decrease more given a smaller 𝑁𝑁 in the denominator at the righthand side of Eq. (1).
From all the subfigures, the transmission rates 𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴 and 𝛽𝛽𝑃𝑃 were always found strongly correlated with the
outcomes while it was not the case for 𝛽𝛽𝑂𝑂 ∙ 𝜅𝜅, the value of which was too small to have a substantial
impact on the outcomes. In addition, parameters 𝛼𝛼, 𝛾𝛾 and 𝜏𝜏 were also found strongly correlated with the
outcomes, and interventions like more effective drug treatment or vaccination would affect such
parameter values.

Case Study
Business executives are strongly recommended to follow the guidelines listed in the Background Section
to prevent the reopening from causing any exacerbation of the ongoing pandemic. However, practical
difficulties may arise due to, e.g., insufficiency of budget or medical recourses such that only some of the
guidelines will be implemented by employers. Through this case study, we illustrated the use of the
transmission model and the cost equation in different scenarios to evaluate the feasibility of reopening.
Note that our simulation results were obtained under many assumptions and subject to both model
structure and parameter value uncertainty; therefore, decisions of business executives should not be made
solely based on the results presented in this section.

In this case study, we focused on four scenarios: I) none of the nine Guidelines was constantly
implemented (baseline scenario); II) all Guidelines 1-9 were constantly implemented; III) Guidelines 1, 2,
3, 4, 6, 9 were constantly implemented; IV) Guidelines 1, 3, 4, 6, 9 were constantly implemented.
Scenarios I was the baseline scenario, corresponding to complete devalue of infection risk. Across
scenarios II-IV, Guidelines 1, 3, 4, 6, 9 were assumed to be always implemented given the necessity and
indispensability of these five Guidelines to business reopening. Scenario III was designed to be less
restrictive than Scenario II, considering that some business entities might not have the budget to deploy
non-contact sensors for real-time fever detection, reduce the number of working hours, or acquire specific
equipment for aerosol transmission prevention. In Scenario IV, the use of PPE was further dropped to
account for the possible shortage of such materials on the market. The implementation of behavioral and
social practice guidelines in Scenarios II-IV led to changes in the values of these three, 𝛽𝛽𝑂𝑂 ∙ 𝜅𝜅, 𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴 , and
𝛽𝛽𝑃𝑃 , parameters in our transmission model. The other model parameters were assumed not directly affected
by Guidelines 1-9. For instance, the recovery rate 𝛾𝛾 primarily depends on subject-specific immunity, the
availability, affordability of effective medical intervention and health care, instead of behavioral and
social practice patterns. For these reasons, we adjusted the values of 𝛽𝛽𝑂𝑂 ∙ 𝜅𝜅, 𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴 , and 𝛽𝛽𝑃𝑃 for scenarios IIIV, respectively, as shown in Table 2. For simplicity, we assumed that the effects of different guidelines
were independent and remained constant throughout the entire simulation time window. We also assumed
that after reopening, every employee rigorously followed the guidelines and immediately reported their
symptoms or infections once identified.
According to the study of Koo et al. (2020), 62 the practice of social distancing together with disease
testing, reporting and quarantine policy (Guidelines 1, 4, and 6) could reduce the number of infections by
78.20% (IQR: 59.0-94.4%) compared with the baseline scenario when R o was 2.5. That is, the
transmission rates might drop to 1-78.2%=21.80% of their baseline values after implementing Guidelines
1, 4 and 6. To quantify the effects of wearing mask, glove, goggle and hand washing (Guideline 2) on
infection transmission, we adopted the results from Seto et al. (2003) 59 and Yin et al. (2004) 63 for severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In their results, the odds ratio for mask wearing was 13 (95% CI: 311
9
60, attack rate = 13.25%), for glove wearing was 2 (95% CI: 0.6-7, attack rate
= 6.77%), for
83

hand-washing was 5 (95% CI: 1-19, attack rate

3
17

133

= 17.65%), and for goggles wearing was

1
0.2

= 5 (95%

CI: 2.44 − 10, attack rate 61.50%). Correspondingly, the transmission rates might drop to 8.83% (95%
CI: 1.92-36.56%) for mask wearing, 48.85% (95% CI: 15.17-100%) for glove wearing, 39.37% (95% CI:
22.40-64.33%) for goggle wearing, and 23.91% (95% CI: 6.32-100%) for hand washing. Thus, due to the
implementation of Guideline 2, the transmission rates might drop to 8.83% × 48.85% × 39.37% ×
23.91% = 0.41% of their baseline values. Zhang et al. (2018) 64 investigated influenza A transmission in
a student office setting, which showed that the infection risk could reduce by 2.14% with implementation
of routine sanitization. Routine sanitation is expected to reducethe transmission rates to 1 − 2.14% =
97.86% of their baseline values after implementing Guideline 3. The implementation of Guideline 5
would improve the implementation of Guidelines 4 and 6 so its effect on infection transmission was not
explicitly quantified in this study. For Guideline 7, we assumed a linear relationship between the number
of working hours and the infection risk. The average working hours per day after reopening was assumed
to be 70% of the regular working hours. Correspondingly, the transmission rates might drop to 70%
(range 50-100%) with Guideline 7. For Guideline 8, according to the report of Mendell et al (2002),65 a
10% to 14% reduction in communicable respiratory infections might result from improved work
environments. Taking 12% as the median, we assumed that the transmission rates might drop to 100% −
12% = 88% (range 86-90%) with implementing Guideline 8. Furthermore, the transmission rates among

9

employees in contact-based positions were not affected by Guideline 9. Finally, in scenarios II, III, and
IV, the transmission rates dropped to21.80% × 0.41% × 97.86% × 70% × 88% = 0.05%,
21.80% × 0.41% × 97.86% = 0.09% and 21.80% × 97.86% = 21.33% of their baseline values,
respectively. See Table 2 for the adjusted transmission rates.
All the simulation results in this section were generated using the same set of initial values for simplicity.
Taking the DELLTM center at Austin, Texas as an example, the total number of active workers after
reopening could be around 14,000. The ratio between the on-site workers and the WFH workers was
assumed as 2:1 (i.e., 9,333 on-site workers and 4,667 WFH workers). On the first day of reopening (day
0), the proportion of silent carriers among all the 14,000 employees was approximated by the proportion
of infections in the general population of U.S. estimated using the number of reported cases as of May 5,
2020. The proportion of workers that had recovered from the infection and thus acquired immunity
(referred as “recovered” in our model) were also estimated from the reported number of recoveries of the
general U.S. population. The numbers of quarantined employees and death on day 0 were assumed to be
0. We conducted the simulations for 200 days for Scenario I and 100 days for Scenarios II-IV to verify
the short-term feasibility of reopening.
As shown in Figures 4-5 for Scenario I, without implementing any of the guidelines, reopening merely
led to a large number of infections and deaths (230 deaths by the last day, 649 quarantined and 422 silent
carriers at their peaks in Figure 4). The prevalence of infections within the business entity exceeded that
in the general population throughout the 200 days time window, and peaked at 114 infections per 1000
people, which was 30 folds higher than that of the general population (Figures 5a). Even by the end of the
200 days, the within-entity prevalence was 8 folds higher (32.9 cases per 1,000 persons) than the
population average. Also, even after we extended the simulation time window to 200 days, the
transmission model still did not reach its steady states, suggesting a less predictable risk of disease
transmission. In short, despite that the net profit remained positive (Figure 5b), since the prevalence in
workplace was constantly (much) higher than that in the general population, reopening turned out to be
infeasible in Scenario I.
If a business entity strictly followed all guidelines 1-9 as in Scenario II, the number of infections and
deaths reduced remarkably, as shown in Figures 6-7 (2 deaths among 9,333 onsite workers, at most 16
quarantined and 35 silent carriers as in Figure 6). Figure 6 also showed that the outcomes of the
transmission model reached a plateau towards the end of the 100-days time window. In other words, the
infection could be contained in this scenario, with the number of carriers and the number of the
quarantined reaching and staying at 0 by day 48 and day 92, respectively. According to Figure 7a, under
the assumption that the prevalence of infections within the business entity was the same as in the general
population at the beginning of reopening, the within-business prevalence dropped under the general
population prevalence immediately (on day 2), and continuously decreased down to 0.035 infections per
1,000 people by the last day of simulation. This within-business prevalence was 104 fold lower than the
general population prevalence reported in other studies. The business also attained higher and more stable
net profit than in Scenario I (Figure 7b).
In Scenario III, guidelines 5, 7, 8 were skipped and the transmission rate values changed accordingly (see
Table 2); however, the simulation results were surprisingly similar to those in Scenario II during the 100day time window (Figures 8-9). Specifically, the numbers of deaths, the quarantined and silent carriers
were nearly the same as those in Scenario II; also, it took approximately the same amount of time for the
numbers of carriers and the quarantined to drop to 0 (Figure 8). The nearly same predicted population
10

trajectories resulted in a nearly same prediction on net profit (Figure 9). To confirm such results,
additional local sensitivity analysis was conducted at the parameter values in Scenarios II and III,
suggesting that the simulation outputs were not sensitive to parameter value changes (e.g., a change of
less than 0.1 in all the five output variables corresponding to 1% parameter value change).
After a business entity further dropped guideline 2 (Mask, glove, and goggle wearing while not alone) in
Scenario IV, our model predicted that the spread of infections did not become uncontrollable within 100
days but associated with a higher cost (Figures 10-11). While the initial within-business prevalence was
the same as the general population prevalence, the workplace quickly became a “hot spot” of infection
spreading, and a prevalence much higher than the population average was reached (Figure 11a). The
within-business prevalence continued to stay above the general population average for 11 days, and
peaked at a level of 4 infections per 1,000 people on day 5. The results suggested that reopening should
stop to prevent this entity from developing into a source of infection and posing significant risk on its
workers as well as their close social contacts. Note that the within-business prevalence dropped to 0.09
infections per 1,000 people by the end of the 100-day time window (Figure 11a), and the numbers of
deaths and the quarantined were controlled under 3 and 20 among 9,333 onsite workers, respectively.
Business executives should not rely on such optimistic predictions and underestimate the infection risk
for two reasons. First, constant parameter values were used in our simulations, which were not capable of
capturing every possible time-varying characteristic of disease transmission over time (i.e., parameter
values could be time-varying instead of being constant). Second, our simulation was performed under the
assumption that all workers strictly followed the selected guidelines. In reality, it is unlikely that every
single employee would faithfully stick to such rules and guidelines daily and constantly over time.
Moreover, Figure 11a suggested that the use of PPE was very important at the early stage of reopening. In
Scenarios II and III, with the use of PPE, we did not observe the rapid increase of prevalence since the
beginning of reopening; however, in Scenario IV without the protection of PPE, the within-business
prevalence started to increase and exceed the population average on day one. This result was consistent
with the recent study by Kai et al (2020), 66 which demonstrated the significant effect of universal use of
facial masks (e.g., at least 80% population wear masks) on impeding the spread of infections.

Discussion
SARS-CoV-2 struck the whole world since 2019 and caused significant loss of human lives and
economy. While various lockdown, quarantine and isolation rules and polices worked effectively to
control COVID infection transmission, numerous businesses were closed and tens of millions people lost
their jobs. As of May 20, 2020, all the states in the U.S. strategically moved towards gradual reopening to
save the economy. However, given that neither effective drug treatments nor vaccines were available, the
risk of infection spreading within a business entity became a key issue that any business executive had to
consider. In this study, an ODE-based transmission model was developed together with a net profit
equation to quantitatively evaluate the trade-off among profit, cost, and infection risk within a business
entity after reopening. Model parameter values were calibrated from heterogeneous sources to enable
computer simulations. Both local and global sensitivity analyses were conducted to understand our model
behavior and result robustness. Finally, a case study assessed scenarios, in which different combinations
of behavioral and social practice guidelines were implemented. The simulation results suggested that
infection transmission was controllable within a business entity and a positive net profit could be
generated after reopening only if a combination of selected guidelines were implemented. Also, our
results suggested that the use of PPE could be significantly important at the early stage of reopening to
prevent infection spreading.

11

We also recognize a number of limitations of this study. First, the mathematical model and the net profit
equation were developed under multiple assumptions. While many of those assumptions are commonly
adopted by related professional communities (e.g., epidemiology or mathematical modeling), some
assumptions were introduced due to the lack of accurate and/or complete information (e.g., asymptomatic
infection transmission rate). With additional efforts invested in future SARS-CoV-2 related research , we
expect that informative and high-quality data will become available such that less assumptions are needed
and more accurate results can be generated by our approach. Second, while we have compiled
information from many different sources to calibrate the possible ranges of model parameter values, the
parameter uncertainty may not be completely characterized by such parameter ranges due to, e.g., the
heterogeneity in population demographics, health conditions, behavioral patterns, and social networks.
Third, although the costs associated with guidelines #1-9 were included in the net profit calculation, our
cost estimation is subject to market fluctuations and many other (unpredictable) factors. It is thus
suggested for users of our model to fine tune parameter values upon available business-specific data or
information. Finally, in this study, herd immunity and vaccination strategies were not considered because
they were not available as of the current moment. Considering the active research on SARS-CoV-2
vaccine and drug development, the availability of effective vaccines and medications can be expected and
it should be taken into consideration in our modeling work at some point.
In summary, this modeling work provides a quantitative tool for decision-makers to explore and evaluate
the business reopening option in the midst of COVID pandemics, and it can be extended to similar
scenarios (e.g., outbreak of unknown or new virus) by re-calibrating related parameter values. We expect
further research efforts in this direction to better prepare for possible strikes of infectious diseases in the
future.
