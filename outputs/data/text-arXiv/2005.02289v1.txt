In Silico Trial to test COVID-19 candidate
vaccines: a case study with UISS platform
Giulia Russo, Marzio Pennisi, Marco Viceconti and Francesco Pappalardo1

Abstract—SARS-CoV-2 is a severe respiratory infection that
infects humans. Its outburst entitled it as a pandemic emergence.
To get a grip on this, outbreak specific preventive and therapeutic
interventions are urgently needed. It must be said that, until now,
there are no existing vaccines for coronaviruses. To promptly and
rapidly respond to pandemic events, the application of in silico
trials can be used for designing and testing medicines against
SARS-CoV-2 and speed-up the vaccine discovery pipeline,
predicting any therapeutic failure and minimizing undesired
effects. Here, we present an in silico platform that showed to be in
very good agreement with the latest literature in predicting SARSCoV-2 dynamics and related immune system host response.
Moreover, it has been used to predict the outcome of one of the
latest suggested approach to design an effective vaccine, based on
monoclonal antibody. UISS is then potentially ready to be used as
an in silico trial platform to predict the outcome of vaccination
strategy against SARS-CoV-2.

I. INTRODUCTION

s the epicenter of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
and emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
caused by novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread is making its
way across the world, global healthcare finds itself facing
tremendous challenges. According to the World Health
Organization (WHO) situation report (91st), updated on 20
April 2020, there have been globally 72846 confirmed cases of
2019-nCoV and 5296 cases of death caused by the virus itself
[1].
2019-nCoV (also referred to as SARS-CoV-2 or HCoV-19)
[2], is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans along
with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E
[3]. While these last four coronaviruses are associated with mild
symptoms, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can
cause severe acute respiratory syndrome [4], especially in
elderlies, of which men, and those individuals with
comorbidities and immunocompromised conditions [5]).
Although it is similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has an
improved ability for pathogenicity [6]. In particular, latest

evidences during the ongoing pandemic reveal that patients
affected by SARS-CoV-2 can progress their clinical picture
from fever, cough, ageusia and anosmia, sore throat,
breathlessness, fatigue, or malaise to pneumonia, acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ
dysfunction illness [7]. Significantly, in most critically ill
patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection is also associated with a severe
clinical inflammatory picture based on a serious cytokine storm
that is mainly characterized by elevated plasma concentrations
of interleukins 6 (IL-6) [8]. In this scenario, it seems that IL-6
owns an important driving role on the cytokine storm, leading
to lung damage and reduced survival [9].
To get a grip on this outbreak and flatten the curve of
infection, a specific therapeutic intervention to prevent the
severity of the disease is urgently needed to reduce morbidity
and mortality because, until now, there are no existing vaccines
for coronaviruses.
The ideal profile for a targeted SARS-CoV-2 vaccine must
address the need of vaccinating human population, with
particular regard of those individuals classified as at high risk,
comprising, for example, frontline healthcare workers,
individuals over the age of 60 and those that show debilitating
chronic diseases.
Recently, specific findings about the genome sequencing of
SARS-CoV-2 in different countries where cases of infection
were registered, revealed its relative intrinsic genomic
variability, its virus dynamics and the related host response
mechanisms, unveiling interesting knowledge useful for the
formulation of innovative strategies for preventive vaccination.
Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 sequencing along with its relative
intrinsic genomic variability [10], the presence of minority
variants generated during SARS-CoV-2 replication [11], the
involved cellular factors that favors SARS-CoV-2 cell entry
[12], the timing in which viral load peaks (during the first week
of illness), its gradual decline (over the second week) and the
increasing of both IgG and IgM antibodies (around day 10 after
symptom onset) represent some of the relevant insights so far
delineated and considered by research community about SARSCoV-2 virus [13].
Even though these findings are having several practice
consequences and suggest valuable conclusions, SARS-CoV-2

dynamics has not been yet fully understood. Information about
which parts of SARS-CoV-2 sequence are recognized by the
human immune system is still limited and scarcely available.
Such knowledge would be of immediate relevance and great
help for the design of new vaccines, facilitating the evaluation
of potential immunogenic candidates, as well as monitoring the
virus mutation events that would be transmitted through the
human population.
Currently, there are at least 42 vaccine candidates around the
world under development and evaluation at different stages
against COVID-19 [14], also accordingly from what reported
by WHO through its continuously undergoing landscapes
documents concerning the COVID-19 candidate vaccines.
These promising vaccine candidates deal with several vaccine
technologies based on recombinant protein subunits [15],
nucleic acids [16], non-replicating and replicating viral vectors
[17], [18], protein constructs [19], virus-like particles [20], liveattenuated virus strains [21], inactivated virus [14], or human
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) [22].
Today, challenges of continuing development of solutions
for COVID-19 pandemic are a mandatory need. As never
before, the application of modeling and simulation can actively
design better vaccine prototypes, support decision making,
decrease experimental costs and time, and eventually improve
success rates of the trials. To this aim, in silico trials (ISTs) for
design and testing medicines [23]–[25] can accelerate and
speed-up the vaccine discovery pipeline, predicting any
therapeutic failure and minimizing undesired effects.
Beyond traditional modeling techniques or applications,
Agent-Based Models (ABMs) represent a paradigm that can
cover the entire spectrum of the vaccine development process
[26], especially for the quantification and prediction of the
humoral and cellular response of a specific candidate vaccine
as well as its efficacy [27].
The simulation platform we use from fifteen years, named
Universal Immune System Simulator (UISS), is based on agentbased methodology, which is able to brilliantly simulate each
single entity of the immune system (and consequently its
dynamics), along with the significant immune responses
induced by a specific pathogen or stimulus. Recently, UISS
provided different success stories in immunology field as it is
most widely reported in the literature [28]–[31].
We chose to analyze, within the wide landscape of potential
candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, a specific crossneutralizing antibody that Wang et al. [32] suggest to be
promising in targeting and binding a communal conserved
epitope of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV on the spike receptor
binding domain [33], through an independent mechanism of
receptor binding inhibition.
As a case study, here we report a first application of UISS in
silico platform to provide predictions of the efficacy of a
potential therapy against COVID-19 based on a mAb strategy
intervention like the one proposed by Wang et al.

II. METHODOLOGY
A. Introduction to Agent-Based Models and UISS, an in silico
platform for the human immune system simulation
Agent-Based Models (ABMs) belong to the class of
mechanistic models, a family of models that, differently from
data-driven models, uses a description of the underlying
mechanisms of a given phenomenon to reproduce it. Such a
description is usually based on different observational data,
previous knowledge and/or hypotheses, and is usually
aggregated and rationalized into a conceptual map (i.e., a flow
chart and/or a schematic disease model) that reassumes the
cascade of events of the phenomenon under investigation. The
conceptual
map
is
then
translated
into
mathematical/computational terms and then executed by
computers to observe, in silico, the evolution of the
phenomenon over time. Besides ABMs, other modeling
techniques based on the mechanistic approach can be used.
Among these, we recall, for example, ordinary and partial
differential equations [34]–[36] and Petri nets [37], [38].
As the name suggests, agent-based models are based on the
paradigm of ‘agents’, autonomous entities that behave
individually according to established rules. Such entities can be
heterogeneous in nature, and are usually represented on a
simulation space where they are free to move, interact eachother and change their internal state as a consequence of
interactions. From a computer science perspective, agents can
be seen as stochastic finite-state machines, capable of assuming
a limited number of discrete states. Using ABMs, the global
evolution of the phenomena is observed by taking into account
the sum of the individual behaviors of all agents, and sometimes
unexpected “emergent” behaviors may be observed.
ABMs have been successfully applied in many research
fields, from social sciences to ecology, from epidemiology to
biology. In the field of immunology, we developed the
Universal Immune System Simulator (UISS), an agent-based
framework that has been extended through the last decades to
simulate the behavior of the immune system response when
challenged against many diseases.
In UISS agents are used to describe cells and molecules of
the immune system, as well as external actors that can
destabilize (i.e., pathogens such as viruses and bacteria) or
restore (i.e. prophylactic and therapeutic treatments) the normal
health of the host.
One of the main features of UISS is its ability to mimic the
adaptive immune response mechanisms. Mammals have in fact
developed an advanced immune system machinery capable to
specifically recognize pathogens in order to better react against
them. This advanced response is based on the ability to exactly
recognize foreign proteins (i.e., epitopes) on pathogens surface
by means of receptors, through a key-to-lock mechanism.
While an explicit implementation would be both unfeasible and
partially inaccurate from a computational point of view, in
UISS we mimic such a process through the use of binary strings.
Binary strings are used for both representing epitopes and
immune system cells’ receptors, and the probability that an
immune system cell recognizes a pathogen is proportional to

IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS, VOL. XX, NO. X, XXX 201X 1
the Hamming distance (the number of mismatching bits)
between the two strings involved into the interaction. Although
this abstraction may seem binding, millions of interactions can
be simulated quickly on modern computers, making easier the
reproduction of many features of the immune system such as
memory, specificity, tolerance and homeostasis. For example,
this abstraction demonstrated able to allow the selection of the
best adjuvant among a series of candidates for an influenza
vaccine when properly coupled with results coming from
existing binding prediction tools [28]. This suggests how such
an abstraction is able to capture the complexity of the problem.
Besides of receptors, UISS implements many other immune
system mechanisms, as thymus selection, haematopoiesis, cell
maturation, Hayflick limit, aging, immunological memory,
antibody hyper-mutation, bystander effect, cell anergy, antigen
processing and presentation.
Up to now, UISS in silico platform has been successfully

Fig. 1. SARS-CoV-2 disease model implemented in UISS. Main
compartments (lung, and lymph-nodes) are delimited with dashed lines.
Peripheral blood compartment is seen as connecting duct, not explicitly
represented. The starting point is the SARS-CoV-2 droplets entrance in the
upper respiratory tract (not shown). Then, all the main infection dynamics is
described. The immune system cascade is shown as it was implemented, based
on the latest research results published in specialized literature. For each
entity, the localization (i.e., the biological compartment in which the entities
are present) and the status (i.e., the differentiation states that an entity can own)
are defined. The results of the immune system mounting process is the killing
of the infected lung epithelial cells by the cytotoxic T lymphocyte and the local
release of both chemokine factors and cytokines. At the humoral level, specific
IgM (first) and IgG (after) directed against SARS-CoV-2 virus are released by
plasma B cells. Regulatory system is also involved in the process. If the
immune system machinery works correctly, regulatory arm shutdowns
excessive cytokines storm, avoiding the severe prognosis of COVID-19.

applied to the design and verification of novel treatments for
many diseases in both preclinical and clinical environments,
including pathologies such as mammary carcinoma [39] and
derived lung metastases [40] , melanoma [41], atherosclerosis
[42], multiple sclerosis [31] and influenza [28].
More recently, UISS has been used as the centerpiece of the
StriTuVaD H2020 project with the aim to create an in silico trial
for tuberculosis. In this context, observations from virtual
patients will be coupled with results from a real clinical trial to
obtain an in silico augmented clinical trial, with greater

3

accuracy and more statistical power [30].
B. SARS-CoV-2 disease model
The SARS-CoV-2 disease model has been implemented in
UISS computational framework starting by identifying a
question of interest. The question of interest describes the
specific question, decision or concern that is being addressed
with a computational model. In other words, the question of
interest lays out the engineering question that is to be answered
(at least in part) through a model. The next step is to define the
context of use (CoU), which provides a detailed and complete
explanation of how the computational model output will be
used to answer the question of interest. In this specific study,
the question of interest is how potential prophylactic or
therapeutic vaccines could cure COVID-19, building or
stimulating an effective immune response against SARS-CoV2 virus. UISS must then represent and reproduce the
fundamental SARS-CoV-2 – immune system competition and
dynamics. To this end, we first selected all the players that have
a role in the viral infection both at cellular and molecular scale
and then we categorized all the interactions among entities that
play a relevant role in this biological scenario. Finally
compartment assumptions have to be done to let the entities
move and interact each other. In our case, we considered the
lung compartment that models the main organ target of the virus
and the generic lymph node that allows immune system entities
to be activated and selected. Figure 1 gives a detailed sketch on
the main compartments, entities and interactions.
SARS-CoV-2 first entry is located in the upper respiratory tract.
Then it proceeds to bronchial and finally to lungs in which it
reaches its main cellular target i.e., the epithelial lung cells
(LEP) [43]. The virus is eventually captured by dendritic cells
(DC) and macrophages (M). DC are the main antigen
processing cells of the immune system [44] that are able to
present the peptides antigen complexed in both major
histocompatibility class I and class II (MHC-I and MHC-II,
respectively). If a DC encounters the native virus form, it can
be able to process it and present its peptides complexed with
MHC-II to CD4 T cells for further actions. DC, upon virus
activation, release interferon type A and B (IFN-A and IFN-B)
and interleukin-12 (IL-12) that are important cytokines in
fighting intracellular pathogens. Also, M are able to capture the
native form of the SARS-CoV-2 and, if properly activated by
pro-inflammatory cytokines, be able to internally destroy it.
After their successful activation, macrophages release a proinflammatory cytokine that is tumor necrosis factor alpha
(TNF-alpha). A fraction of SARS-CoV-2 viruses reach LEP
and through the envelope spike glycoprotein binds to their
cellular receptor, ACE2. Doing that, the viral RNA genome
starts to be released into the cytoplasm and is translated into two
polyproteins and structural proteins, after which the viral
genome begins to replicate inside the cell [45]. Following the
flux of the conceptual disease model represented in Figure 1,
after a certain amount of time (that we tuned with available data,
as described in the next sections), new copies of the virus are
released from the infected LEP that eventually dies. New
released copies of functional SARS-CoV-2 infect new cells,
spreading further the infection in the lungs. When a cell is
infected by a virus, it can be susceptible of different destinies.
One of them is the shutting down of MHC-I expression to avoid

IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS, VOL. XX, NO. X, XXX 201X 1
immune system recognition from specific CD8 T cells. In this
case, a population of innate immunity cells, natural killer cells
(NK) may identify them and proceed to kill them through
specific actions. The other one is represented by a different
MHC-I presentation on the cell surface, as the virus has
modified the normal behavior of cell to let the host to make
functioning virus copies. In this circumstance, (that we
supposed to happen during SARS-CoV-2 infection) cell MHCI presentation is different from the normal case. DC are able
(through a mechanism known as “nibbling” process [46]) to
cross present the antigen complexed with MHC-I proteins to let
adaptive immune response to recognize and kill virus infected
cells. Activated and antigen presenting cells (both DC and/or
M) migrate into the proximal lymph nodes to present their
content to adaptive immune cells i.e., T cells and B cells. Also,
a portion of viruses could eventually migrate to the lymph
nodes. Here, B cells can be activated by virus if specific
immunoglobulin receptor in B cell surface binds to it. In this
context, B cell is activated, and it immediately releases
immunoglobulins of M class (IgM) that are the first antibody
response that can be measured. Further, APC cells activate CD4
T cells (helper T cells, Th) that under the influence of specific

4

infection. Eventually, Tc migrate into the site of infection and
recognize and kill infected LEP. Tc killed infected LEP release
chemokines and interleukin 1 and 6 (IL-1 and IL-6). IL-1 is the
main cytokine that induces several systemic effects in the host,
for example fever. IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine that can
change the severity of COVID-19 disease as reported in very
recent literature [47]. Our disease model takes good account of

Fig. 3. In silico SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics and related CPE in a severe
scenario. In the left panel, one can observe the severe digital patient case in
which a virus challenge dose of 0.1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) was
administered at day 0 (green line). Peak viral titers are reached by 48 h postinoculation. In addition, it is wort to note that virus persists after day 10, until
day 15, and its complete clearance is around day 19. In the inner panel (purple
line), IL-6 dynamics and its related plasma levels (fg/µL) are shown. IL-6
dynamics shows a much more prominent peak of values. This is in very good
agreement with latest literature data, as explained within the manuscript. In the
right panel, the dynamics of CPE on the lung infected cells is measured: in this
case, CPE are much more severe and the recover from infection is clearly
delayed. UISS is capable to simulate, accordingly to the recent literature, how
the severe cases tend to have a higher viral load both at the beginning and later
on.

Fig. 2. In silico SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics and related CPE in a mild to
moderate scenario. In the left panel, one can observe the mild digital patient
case in which a virus challenge dose of 0.1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) was
administered at day 0 (green line). Peak viral titers are reached by 48 h postinoculation. IL-6 dynamics and its related plasma levels (fg/µL) are also shown
in the inner panel (purple line). In the right one, the dynamics of CPE on the
lung infected cells is measured: they started at day 3.5 and peak around day 5.
After 21 days, the simulated digital patient almost recovers from the infection.
One can notice how UISS is capable to simulate, accordingly to the recent
literature, the early viral clearance by day 10 post-onset in mild cases.

cytokines released before, differentiate into helper T cell type 1
(Th1). Th1 migrate under chemokines gradient to the site of
infection. There, they release interferon gamma (IFN-G) that
makes macrophages able to destroy captured viral particles and
allow them to release IL-12 that promotes immune system
activation against the virus. Th1 cells allow the differentiation
and the iso-switching B cells into immunoglobulins class G
(IgG) producing plasma cells. IgG are specific antibodies that
bind against virus receptors, eventually inhibiting its capacity
to infect cells. MHC-I/peptides DC presenting cells are also
able to activate CD8 cytotoxic T cells (Tc) to destroy SARSCoV-2 infected cells and then eliminate the reservoir of

the cytokines storm in the prognosis of the severity of the
disease. Entities (both cellular and molecular) move and diffuse
in a simulation space represented as a L X L lattice (L is set
depending on the dimension of the compartment one intends to
reproduce), with periodic boundary conditions. There is no
correlation between entities residing on different sites at a fixed
time as the interactions among cells and molecules take place
within a lattice-site in a single time step. All entities are allowed
to move with a uniform probability between neighboring
lattices in the grid and with an equal diffusion coefficient
(Brownian motion).
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Tuning and validation of SARS-CoV-2 disease model
Scientific knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 is still not complete
and research contributions appear every day. Apart from this,
we used all the available literature data to compare the
dynamics predicted by the UISS platform with all findings we
were able to fetch. The first task we accomplished with success
was the evaluation of the replication kinetic of SARS-CoV-2.
To this end, we set a first use case simulation considering a
digital patient in which a virus challenge dose of 0.1
multiplicity of infection (MOI) was administered at day 0.

eventually favoring their iso-type switching to IgG producing plasma cell. B

millimeters of lymph tissue and 5 microliters of peripheral
blood. Figure 2 (right panel) shows that peak viral titers are
reached by 48 h post-inoculation. We also plotted IL-6
dynamics: as reported in [9] the levels of IL-6 could be provide
a prognosis on the severity of the infection.
We also measured cytopathic effects (CPE) on the lung
compartment. CPE are defined as changes occurred in the
infected cell that eventually lead its lysis or inability to
reproduce. Figure 2 (left panel) highlights the dynamics of
CPE: they started at day 3.5 and peak around day 5. After 21
days, the simulated digital patient almost recovers from the
infections. These findings are in good agreement with actual
literature [13], [48].
In a recent work, Liu et al [49] reported that mild cases were
found to have an early viral clearance, with 90% of these
patients repeatedly testing negative by day 10 post-onset. At the
same time, they found that all severe cases still tested positive
at or beyond day 10 post-onset. Moreover, severe cases tended
to have a higher viral load both at the beginning and later. In
contrast, mild cases had early viral clearance 10 days post onset. UISS was also able to reproduce this scenario. As one can
see, Figure 2 is in very good agreement for viral clearance.
We also were able to reproduce severe conditions acting on the
immune system aging parameters obtaining results showed in
Figure 3. In this case, Figure 3 (right panel) shows virus
presence after day 10, until day 15, and its complete clearance
about day 19. Moreover, CPE are much more severe and the
recover from infection was clearly delayed (left panel). IL-6
dynamics shows a much more prominent peak of values. This
is in very good agreement with latest literature data, as
explained before.

responses in terms of activated CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, IgM
and IgG antibodies, detected in blood before symptomatic
recovery. As one can see from Figure 4, the kinetics of activated
Th1 cells (panel A), activated CD8 T cells (panel B) and the
IgM and IgG (panel C) predicted by the simulator are in good
agreement with their findings.
B. UISS IST to predict mAb efficacy against SARS-CoV-2
UISS is an immune system simulation platform that was
designed to be applied to several and different scenarios,
especially to carry on in silico trials to predict the efficacy of a
specific prophylactic or therapeutic vaccine against a particular
disease. In silico trials aim to strongly reduce the time to
develop new effective therapeutics: this is particularly crucial
in situation like the one we are facing with. As soon as a disease
model incorporated into UISS is tuned and validated against
available data, it can be used as an in silico lab to test new
vaccines. In the previous section, we demonstrated that UISSSARS-CoV-2 is able to reproduce and predict the main aspects
of the viral infection. As a working example, here we show how
the platform can be immediately used to predict the efficacy of
a human monoclonal antibody that neutralizes SARS-CoV-2
developed by Wang et al. [32]. In this work the authors suppose
that the developed antibody (named 47D11) neutralizes SARSCoV-2 through a yet unknown mechanism that is different from
receptor binding interference. Hence, in implementing the
mechanism of action of 47D11 into UISS computational
framework we used the alternative mechanisms of coronavirus
neutralization by receptor-binding domain (RBD) targeting
antibodies that have been reported, including spike inactivation
through antibody-induced destabilization of its prefusion
structure, which Wang et al. indicated also applicable for
47D11. We then modeled the receptor interaction to
trigger irreversible conformational changes in coronavirus
spike proteins enabling membrane fusion, as described in [51].
The validation in silico trial consists in simulating the in vitro
experiment conducted by Wang et al. where they showed that
the monoclonal antibody was effective in contrasting SARSCoV-2 to infect the target cells. To mimic the in vitro system
that is an isolated system, we disabled both the lung and the

Fig. 6. In silico trial of 47D11 to predict preventive efficacy. The overall
prediction dynamics of LEP at the injection time of 47D11 mAb (day 1) at a
concentration of 10ng/ml after different SARS-CoV-2 challenge in time (panels
A to F) is depicted. Specifically, one can observe the exposures at virus particles
at day 7 (panel A), day 14 (panel B), month 1 (panel C), month 3 (panel D),
month 6 (panel E) and after 1 year (panel F). Solid lines refer to the no-treated
digital patient while dashed lines refer to mAb treated one. Blue lines depict
actively infected LEP while red lines represent LEP to show the CPE. Panel A
highlights that if a patient enters in contact with the virus just after 7 days post
vaccination, he is fully protected from the infection (SARS-CoV-2 actively
infected values of LEP are low). This is also true if a potential subject is being
infected after two weeks (panel B), one month (panel C) or three months (panel
D) after vaccination. Oppositely, in panel E (subject infected after 6 months) and
panel F (subject infected after one year) mAb vaccination is practically
ineffective in protecting the onset of the disease.

Figure 6 depicts the dynamics of LEP while we injected the
47D11 mAb at day 1 at a concentration of 10ng/ml.
Subsequently, we injected SARS-CoV-2 virus particles at day
7 (panel A), day 14 (panel B), month 1 (panel C), month 3
(panel D), month 6 (panel E) and after 1 year (panel F). Solid
lines refer to the no-treated digital patient while dashed lines
refer to mAb treated one. Blue lines depict actively infected
LEP while red lines represent LEP to show the CPE.
Panel A of figure 6 clearly demonstrates that if a patient enters
in contact with the virus just after 7 days post vaccination, he is
fully protected from the infection: as one can see, SARS-CoV2 actively infected values of LEP are low. This is also true if a

2) mAb as a therapeutic vaccine
The second experiment we designed is to use our in silico trial
platform to predict the efficacy of a mAb-based vaccine in
therapeutic settings. We envisaged both mild-moderate case
(the same digital patient type shown in Figure 2) and severe
case (the same digital patient shown in Figure 3). For both
cases, we administered the mAb vaccine one day and two days

potential subject is being infected after two weeks (panel B),
one month (panel C) or three months (panel D) after
vaccination. Things change for the other two cases i.e., panel E
(subject infected after 6 months) or panel F (subject infected
after one year). In this circumstance, the computational
framework predicts that the mAb vaccination is practically
ineffective in protecting the onset of the disease. A second
injection of the mAb is suggested around month 4 to extend the
protection of the host for one year.

lymph node compartments and we turned off all the immune
system interactions in UISS. We then injected virus particles in
the peripheral blood compartment of the simulator along with
different concentrations of mAb. Only LEP-SARS-CoV-2
interaction has been allowed to happen. Figure 5 shows the
obtained results.
As one can envisage from the figure, we reproduced with great
accuracy the in vitro results reported by Wang et al. In
particular, the computational framework was able to correctly
predict the efficacy of 47D11 mAb simulating its mechanism of
action that induces the entering of the virus inside LEP. The
most effective concentration is 10 ng/ml. This step makes the
simulation platform ready for usage as a in silico trial to predict
now the effects of a mAb therapy. For this purpose, we designed
two kind of in silico experiments. The first one dealt with mAb
vaccination strategy used to prevent the onset of infection. The
second one involved mAb as interventional drug to treat already
infected hosts.

Fig. 7. In silico trial of 47D11 to predict therapeutic efficacy. Different
behaviors for both mild-moderate case (panels A and B) and severe case
(panels C and D) are shown. In panel A, mAb is injected one day after the
onset of infection. In panel B, mAb is injected two days after the onset of
infection. In panel C, mAb is injected one day after the onset of infection.
In panel D, mAb is injected two days after the onset of infection. Blue lines
depict actively infected LEP while red lines represent LEP to show the CPE.
As one can notice, mAb vaccine is effective in preventing or strongly
limiting the CPE only by two days of the infection.

after the onset of infection. Figure 7 shows different behavior
for both mild-moderate case (panel A, mAb injected one day
after the onset of infection, and panel B, mAb injected two days
after the onset of infection) and severe case (panels C, mAb
injected one day after the onset of infection, and panel D, mAb
injected two days after the onset of infection). As Figure 7
depicts, mAb vaccine is effective in preventing or strongly
limiting the CPE. If the mAb vaccine is injected after two days,
it is not able to protect the LPE of the host to be infected by the
virus and consequently from COVID-19 pathology.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we present an in silico platform that was
demonstrated able to reproduce the main dynamics of SARSCoV-2 virus and the elicited host immune response against it.
The disease model was implemented inside UISS

IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS, VOL. XX, NO. X, XXX 201X 1
computational framework, an in silico trial platform that has
been applied to several biological scenario. UISS shows that the
simulated SARS-CoV-2 dynamics is in very good agreement
with the one described in the latest literature; also, the immune
system response predicted by UISS against the virus mirrored
the one observed in state of the art research data. This validation
step entitled UISS-SARS-CoV-2 to be used as a in silico lab to
test the efficacy of potential vaccines for COVID-19, knowing
a priori their mechanism of action. Hence, we set an in silico
trial to test a recent vaccination strategy based on the
employment of monoclonal antibodies directed against a
specific target protein of the virus. The simulator is in good
agreement in predicting the in vitro experiment outcome
performed by the inventors of 47D11 mAb. Finally, we
designed two experimental settings to predict the efficacy of
mAb vaccination when used in both preventive and therapeutic
cases. We predicted that mAb is an effective therapy when used
as a preventive vaccine (granting up one year protection when
injected with a two times schedule). Moreover, we envisaged
that 47D11 mAb if effective only if administered in a very
stringent time-frame if employed as a therapeutic strategy.
