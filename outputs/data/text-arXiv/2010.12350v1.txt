Abstract: To tackle the COVID-19 infection, frequent hand-washing and respiratory hygiene
measures like wearing face-masks and maintaining a minimum distance from others are often
considered as the most important ways to prevent the spread of the virus. These nonpharmaceutical interventions, in the absence of vaccines or pharmaceutical therapies, are
expected to reduce the infection rate over time. These behaviors are often argued to be prosocial, which are driven by multiple social motives such as, social norms, reciprocity,
cooperation and social learning. However one must incur private cost, which may be due to
reasons like economic or fatigue to benefit or protect others. Using self-reported data across
India (n=934) collected through social media platforms, we assess if changes in perceived
community compliance can predict changes in individual compliance behavior, controlling for
the potential confounders. We observe statistically significant and positive relationship between
the two, even after accounting for omitted variable bias and other robustness and falsification
tests, plausibly allowing us to view the results from a plausible causal lens. Further, we find
subsequent lockdowns such as the ones imposed in India, having a detrimental effect on
individual compliance though the gains from higher perceived community compliance seem to
offset this loss. We also find that sensitization through community can be particularly effective
for people with pre-existing co-morbidities. Our findings underscore the need for multi-level
behavioral interventions involving local actors and community institutions to sustain private
compliance during the pandemic. We suggest these interventions need to be specially targeted
for individuals with chronic ailments especially in places like medical shops and health centres
where they are more likely to visit. Apart from the policy implications, the paper assumes
contextual importance as India remains as among the most affected countries across the globe.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has spread globally claiming more than a million
lives. 1 To tackle it, at the individual level, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other
experts recommend frequent hand-washing and respiratory hygiene by wearing a mask and

maintaining a minimum distance from others as the most important ways to prevent the spread of
the virus.2 These non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), in the absence of vaccines or
pharmaceutical therapies, are expected to reduce the infection rate over time. In the initial period,
government across developed and developing countries relied on deterrence measure like
lockdown to induce compliance. These measures involved restrictions on human movement and
accompanying closure of public institutions like schools and colleges as well as work places and
business institutions. Given the fact that these are costly to adopt in terms of time and effort,
when imposed uniformly on a heterogeneous population of varying income and social class, the
private level of compliance would vary. Some have argued that those with high opportunity cost
would then exercise lesser precaution, particularly if long drawn movement restrictions impinge
upon their income and livelihood. Additionally, as the economy reopens the need to adopt
alternative interventions for inducing optimal social distancing becomes an important policy
concern.
In as much as the compliance to COVID-19 protocols confers collective benefits,
substantial concerns include the associated private cost such as inability to work, or poorer
wellbeing due to social isolation and the disruption of their livelihood (Ahmed et al. 2020;
Lancet, 2020). As a result, voluntary compliance effort might fall short of the optimum over
time. Some of the compliance activities are costly and difficult to monitor like use of sanitizers
and hand-washing. Thus, imposing penalties or sanctions for partially observable compliance
behavior, may not guarantee best outcomes particularly if violation of COVID-19 related norm
can take place in the private domain. It is here that the importance of community arises because
much of the motivation for compliance behaviors are pro-social, which can be driven by multiple
social motives such as, social norms, reciprocity, cooperation and social learning (Batson and
Powell, 2003; Dovidio et al. 2017). Studies have shown that people are strongly motivated by
their peers, through peer pressure to align with the group and to reciprocate pro-social behavior
such as wearing a mask or staying indoors for the greater public good (Rand et al. 2014).
Understanding these motivations during the COVID-19 pandemic is important to inform
effective public messaging efforts. In this context, using online self-reported data collected from

934 respondents across India, we assess if positive perception about community compliance
behavior is associated with higher levels of individual abidance of the preventive measures.
Further, we also examine the changes in compliance behavior over the subsequent lockdowns
implemented in India from March 25 to May 31, 2020 after the outbreak and assess the
implications of better perceived community compliance. Since individuals with chronic comorbidities are more susceptible to serious illness, we also assess the implications of community
abidance over these set of individuals as well.
The importance of the context is significant here since India has been among the most
affected countries in the world. Currently (October 11, 2020),, more than 7.1 million infected
cases have been reported with a death toll of more than 110,000 . As a preventive measure, the
government had ordered a nationwide massive lockdown in four phases: Phase 1: 24 MarchApril 14; Phase 2: April 15 to May 3; Phase 3: May 4 to May 17 and Phase 4: May 18 till May
31. In all these phases, India imposed the strictest lockdown rules curbing individual movements
for non-essential purpose, mandating face-masks and allowing no social gatherings. Despite this
we find a substantial increase in the number of infection cases over these four lockdowns
(Figure1). Notably, the economic loss during this period was substantial as India recorded a
slump by about -23.9 percent (year-on-year) in the quarter of April to June, 2020.3 Studies have
documented the huge economic disruptions among different section in the economy in India
(Ceballos et al. 2020; Mehra et al., 2020)

Theoretically, one major driver for private compliance would be to ensure better health
and avoid the possibility of getting infected. The other driver that confers collective benefits,
stems from moral motivation to protect others. Variants of moral motivation like pure altruism
(Andreoni, 1988; Andreoni, 1989), and improved self-image (Brekke et.al., 2003) have been
used to explain voluntary contribution in public good contexts (Chorus, 2015). In this strand of
literature, individual adherence to pro social behavior occurs because a positive utility is derived
from matching actions that are considered ideal. In fact, studies have argued how individual
behavior are often driven by norms, social expectations and first order beliefs about whether her
community follows a particular behavior (Lyon, 2000; Cialdini and Goldstein, 2004; Bicchieri,
2017). In the context of disease outbreaks like COVID-19 there is a possibility that abidance to
the compliance protocols might be motivated by such pro social concerns. On the other hand,
economic incentives often interact with moral incentive such that collective behavior may
impose a decision externality on private action (Collier and Venables, 2014). Better community
preparedness that pose lesser chances of infection may induce individuals to reduce her
preventive efforts. Thus, the net effect of community compliance level on individual action is
ambiguous4. Moreover, government reliance on lockdowns may intensify economic hardship
which could weaken the community ties that motivates compliance. In fact, studies have
documented that individual compliance might be inversely related with the duration of social
distancing measures (Briscese et. al., 2020; Moraes, 2020). While economic hardship and
violation of COVID-19 related norms have received considerable attention in the current
scenario, the impact of moral motivation and health seeking behavior is relatively less explored.
Our study adds to this evidence by analyzing the direction of the effect of community
compliance on individual protective action.
The findings indicate a statistically significant, robust and positive relationship between
perceived community compliance and individual compliance levels. Notably, these positive
relationships hold even after accounting for the potential unobservable that include strategies
4

Prolonged self-isolation when the outside community is engaging in proper preventive measures might
adversely affect physical and mental health (Rozenkrantz et al. 2020).

developed by Altonji et al. (2005) and Oster (2019) indicate that our findings might be viewed
through the causal lens though concerns about reverse causality remain. We also find compliance
for co-morbid respondents to increase systematically with higher levels of perceived community
compliance. Interestingly we find a significant decline in compliance levels with subsequent
lockdowns but the gains through higher community compliance seems to offset this loss. Given
this evidence, we propose a set of recommendations that can increase adoption of preventative
measures to curb COVID-19 transmission. Among others, we propose behavioral interventions
and outreach programmes through active local community institutions that makes community
compliance visible and salient among its members. Further underestimation of the actual
community compliance can be corrected since it can reinforce positive norms.
The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 gives a brief outline of the theoretical
underpinnings and conceptual framework. Section 3 discusses the data and the variables. Section
4 and section 5 reports the results while the associated discussion are presented in Section 6. A
brief conclusion is provided in section 7.
2. Conceptual Framework

Consider a society with N individuals and the utility function of individual, i is given by
(
Here

is the consumption of private goods

) ( )
denotes the health status and

is the measure of

individual’s self-image. We assume that the utility function is continuous and strictly quasiconcave. We suppose further that the health stock of the individual depends on his compliance
level,

,say that is given by the amount of time, she distances herself from the society and/or

the amount of time that she engages in protective activities like wearing mask and hand-washing
among others. However, private health stock would also depend on the extent to which
community in his neighborhood follows the health norm. Given the infectious nature of the
COVID-19, we presume community behavior would have an impact upon individual health
through contagion dynamics. For simplicity, we assume that the individual interacts only within
her own neighborhood, which, given the extended lockdown period and high neighborhood
interaction seems plausible in the Indian context. Let the perception about community health

norm be given as ̅ . We then suggest the following functional form of the health status of the
individual using
(

̅)

( )

Thus, health is a concave function of individual compliance.
The other role that community compliance has is through its moral appeal. We assume that
individual converge to behavioral conformity by attempting to adopt the community level
compliance. In the literature such pro-social moves have been modeled as one emanating from
stigma from not following socially prescribed action (Akerlof and Kranton,2000; Brekke et.al.,
2003) or individual might want to do what the others are doing in order to signal themselves as
desirable social types (Bernheim,1994; Bigenho and Martinez, 2019). Following these literature,
we assume that the representative individual would attempt to bolster his self-image by
following the compliance behavior of the community
Accordingly, we define the self-image function
(

̅)

as in Brekke et al. (2003). The function is concave in
̅ and it is decreasing if

Equation (5) defines the relation between

and ̅ . The first term on the RHS denotes the

opportunity cost of consumption relative to self-image from changes in individual compliance.
Since

this term is negative for a given wage. On the other hand, the third term on the

right hand side gives the marginal health benefit relative to self-image from changes in
individual health compliance and given the concavity assumption is positive. Thus, the extent to
which individual compliance would deviate from the community compliance would depend on
the relative strength of these two terms. 5
3. Data, variables and estimation
3.1 Data
The data used in the paper is obtained from an online survey of 934 respondents across India
from April 27 to May 31, 2020 mainly through snowball sampling. Since this survey was
conducted during the lockdown face to face interviews or even phone call interviews could not
be conducted in absence of a representative set of phone numbers. The survey was distributed via
online platforms like the WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter among others.
The survey was administered in four main languages: Bengali, Hindi, English and Tamil
and hence our survey has majority of the respondents from West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and parts
of the Hindi speaking belt that includes the Northern India. The questionnaire form and the data
sheet were administered in Google form. Research assistants who were native speakers of these
languages pre-tested the questionnaires. Suggestions to improve comprehension and flow of the
survey were incorporated. We used several channels of distribution to ensure variation in our
sample with respect education, occupation, age and gender. This study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board at the University of Pennsylvania (Protocol No.: 843016).
The survey focused on individual level compliance and gathered data on the respondent’s
behavior a week prior to the survey on a set of compliance protocols. These protocols included
(i) whether the respondent used face-masks while going out or speaking to others outside their
household members; (ii) whether she maintained six-feet distance in public; (iii) whether she
washed hands with soap more than that before the lockdown started and (iv) whether she used
hand sanitizer. Further, it collected information on perceptions about the community compliance
through a number of indicators. The related questions are: out of 10 individuals in the
community, how many does s/he think have (i) stepped outside for non-essential purpose; (ii)
maintained 6 feet of distance while talking and (iii) washed their hands regularly with soap. The

survey also collected information on respondent’s belief about their community on indicators
that include questions like: out of 10 individuals in the community, how many does she think
have believe that (i) people should step out only for essential purposes; and (ii) at least 6 feet/ 2
meters distance should be maintained while talking. In addition to these questions, we collected
information on other household and individual level characteristics. Further details have been
included in table 1.

3.2 Variables and estimation
We use the first two indicators related to stepping outside for non-essential purpose and
maintaining six feet distance while interacting with others for calculating the perception about
community compliance. We left out the third indicator pertaining to hand-washing since this
behavior about the others in the community is not observable for the respondents. We
standardized these variables and use that to calculate perception about community compliance.
Our dependent variable is individual level compliance, which is calculated by standardizing the
four protocol adherence variables that we mentioned. We use Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) to

regress the individual level compliance score on the perception about community compliance
scores controlling for the potential confounders. The list of confounders and the associated
variable construction are given in table 2.

Individual
We use the four indicators of individual compliance to

calculate the score. First we created dummy variables to

the last week or not
We first normalize each of the four dummy variables to
have zero mean and a standard deviation of one. Then we
sum up the standardized measures and then again restandardize such that the final score would have 0 mean
and one standard deviation. This method has been used by
Heath and Tan (2019) for their calculation of women
autonomy.

earlier case, we first normalize each of the two indicators

and one standard deviation. Here, for the second indicator
(Out of 10 people in your community, how many do you
think have stepped out of their house for non-essential
purposes?), we used subtracted 10 from the responses and
then took the modulus value since both indicators would
now present positive beliefs about the community.

4.1 Descriptive statistics
Table 3 gives an overview of the sample of respondents with respect to the individual
compliance level during the survey through different indicators that we collected during the
survey. The descriptive statistics on the associated indicators used to derive the perception about
community compliance scores are also presented. Fifty six percent of our sample reported of

maintaining social distance in the one week prior to the survey every time they interacted with
others while over 82 percent report regular wearing of face-masks. Our respondents reported that
they perceived 6 people out of 10 in their community on average maintained social distancing as
well as stepped out only for essential purposes.

4.2 Regression Results
First, we examine the relationship between the standardized individual compliance score and the
perception about community compliance scores. Table 5 presents the regression results. We
sequentially introduce different groups of covariates to confirm if the marginal effects of the
community compliance remain stable with increasing explanatory power of the model. In the
first specification, only the community compliance scores are incorporated in the model and in
the second model, the lockdown dummy is included. In the next specifications, the household
characteristics and then individual characteristics are included along with the lockdown dummy
(a dummy to indicate phase 3 and phase 4 lockdown). In the final preferred specification, we put

all the controls together with the state fixed effects (West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and others).
Notably, we have controlled for perception about community beliefs about the compliance
protocols which would control for any systematic bias that the respondent may have about the
community. The findings indicate that the community compliance scores, in all the specification
are statistically significant at 1% level. Notably, the effect size do not alter across specifications
as we find one standard deviation increase in perception about community compliance abidance
is associated with about 0.27-0.29 standard deviation increase in private compliance.
Of note is the fact that we find a significant negative effect of the subsequent lockdowns
on compliance. In regression models where we replace the lockdown variable with the time since
the first survey (in days), the findings remain similar as a robust negative association of
individual compliance is found with this variable. This indicates the possibility of a fatigue effect
along with non-compliance due to potential economic activity economic as discussed earlier.

Even though the marginal effects of community compliance remain largely stable in all
the specifications, endogeneity from OVB and reverse causality remains a concern that prevents

us from interpreting these results from the causal lens. With respect to OVB, there might be other
unobservable factors correlated with community level compliance as well as his/ her own
abidance that we did not account for. With respect to reverse causation, existing literature
indicates that high association of bias in prevalence perception with one’s own personal
behavior. In particular, it found that people tend to perceive that their own behavior to be more
common in the community than it actually is, often called the “false consensus effect” (Ross et
al., 1977; Kuang et al. 2020). Therefore, because of the potential OVB and reverse causation, we
may not be able to say higher community compliance is causally related to better abidance of the
compliance protocols.
4.3 Accounting for Omitted Variable Bias (OVB)
To assess the potential changes in the coefficients after accounting for OVB, we use a
strategy developed by Oster (2019) based on Altonji et al. (2005), based on the assumption that
selection on unobservable variables can be gauged by the extent of selection on observables. For
further elaboration, we consider the following regression equation:
Y   Z  X U

Here Y is the outcome variable, Z is the primary variable of interest, X is the vector of
observable controls and U is the set of all unobserved components. If U is substantially high, our
aim is to examine the corresponding changes in  . Here the primary assumption is:

cov( Z ,U )
cov( Z ,  X )

var(U )
Var (  X )
This implies that the relationship between Z and the unobserved component is proportional to
the correlation between Z and the observed component and 

gives the degree of

proportionality. With this, it is possible to derive a consistent estimator of  as a function of two
parameters:  and Rmax . Rmax is the R-squared value of a hypothetical regression which includes
the observable as well as the unobserved components in the model. Among various options to
compute the bound on Rmax , based on data from a sample of randomized experiments, Oster
(2016) proposes Rmax  1.3* R0 , where R0 is the R-squared value of the full model with observed

covariates.6 For parameter , if we assume that the extent of bearing of the observables is at least
as important as the effect of omitted variables, then the bound for

[-1,1] (Altonji et al., 2005;

Mukhopadhyay and Sahoo, 2016). Oster (2019) suggests two equivalent approaches to verify if
the effect becomes indistinguishable from zero after controlling for the OVB. Firstly, this
involves checking if

for which the coefficient of interest turns 0 with Rmax  1.3* R0 exceeds a

threshold of 1. We also tested this with the Rmax value to be as high as Rmax  2* R0 . The
argument is if

exceeds 1 or -1, the extent of the association with unobservable has to be

massively high, which may not be valid. Secondly, we test the coefficient value changes its sign
if in the interval

[-1,1] and Rmax   * R0 where

. If sign does not change,

then even if the extent of association with the unobservable is as high as that with the
observables and in either direction as well, the null hypothesis of   0 can be rejected. From
Table 6, which presents the relevant results, we observe that
Similarly, we find  to be in the range 0.27-0.28 when

is much higher than 1 (1.35-2.8).

changes from 1 to -1 with Rmax =0.195

( Rmax  1.3* R0 ) and between 0.21 to 0.29 with Rmax =0.3 ( Rmax  2* R0 ). This implies that the
marginal effects of community compliance scores on community compliance on individual
COVID-19 protocol abidance remains significant even after accounting for the potential OVB.

Notes. The uncontrolled coefficient is from the regression of individual compliance score
without any other control variables. The controlled coefficient is from its regression on the
perception about community compliance, adjusting for all the control variables. We use the
command psacalc in STATA 14.

The bounding value of the cut off at 1.3 as per Oster (2016) allows effects from at-least 90% of the random experiments to survive.

Further, we apply other robustness checks as well to ensure that the relationship is robust and do
not get alter with changes in specification, methods or the formulation of the dependent and
independent variable.7 These are as follows:
(i) Individual compliance protocols: We examine the relationship between abidance of the
compliance protocol indicators separately with perception about community compliance for each
the two protocol indicators we consider through a probit regression. The findings indicate
positive relationship for most of these compliance indicators signifying that our results are robust
(appendix table A2).
(ii) With sub-samples: Since most of the responses were from the states of West Bengal and
Tamil Nadu, we ran the same regressions with respondents only from these two states. In a
separate exercise, because majority of our respondents came from the bigger cities, we also run
the same regressions separately for respondents from only the six biggest cities of India: New
Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad and Bangalore. In these regressions, we
incorporate city level fixed effects that would control for city specific observables that include
deaths, number of tests and administrative efforts among others that may be correlated with
compliance protocol abidance. The inference from the regressions is qualitatively similar to what
we observed with the full sample (appendix A3).
(iii) Falsification tests: For falsification test, we replace the outcome variable with a nonequivalent variable that is not expected to change in response to changes in the treatment. In our
survey, we collect information on satisfaction about government measures taken on distribution
of food ration to the poor and dealing with the internal migrant crisis that the country faced with
the lockdown.8 Since these variables are views on government actions which are not related to
compliance or even COVID protocol awareness, they are unlikely to be related to the
respondent’s perception about community compliance. This is indeed found to be the case as we
observe the coefficient of community compliance score is statistically indistinguishable from
zero (appendix table A4).
Relationship with lockdown and health conditions
7

All these results from robustness checks are given in appendix.
Because of the sudden enforcement of the lockdown, there has been a mass exodus of migrant laborers from the
cities to the villages leaving them starved and a number of deaths have been reported from across the country
(Lancet, 2020)
8

In the first part of the analysis, we find the lockdown (phase 3 and 4) dummy is found to be
negatively associated with individual compliance. Can higher perception about community
compliance offset this decline in compliance over time? To answer this, we introduce an
interaction of the community compliance variable and the lockdown dummy in the regression
model and study the estimations (Table 4).

We observe that the marginal effect of this

interaction term to be positive implying an over-time increase in the potential effect of the
respondent’s perception about community compliance on her own compliance behavior. Hence,
individual compliance which can potentially decline over time because of fatigue and economic
conditions, enhancing perception on community level compliance can have a positive effect.

Studies have indicated individual with pre-existing chronic conditions like diabetes and
high blood pressure have higher health risks (Fang et al. 2020; Klonoff and Umpierrez, 2020).
Despite this, our regression results seem to indicate respondents with co-morbidities do not have
significantly higher compliance (Table 7). Accordingly, we assess the heterogeneous effects of
community compliance with individual compliance among these respondents (Table 4). The
findings indicate that the community compliance is positively related and, statistically significant
at 5% level.
We argue this finding has considerable policy implications. Unhealthy respondents who
have higher health risk, can benefit from community level interventions that increase their
perception about abidance, since it can have positive effect on their own compliance. Further,
individual compliance which can potentially decline over time because of fatigue and economic
conditions, enhancing perception on community level compliance can have a positive association
with it, which can possibly be causal as well.

6. Discussion and policy implications
The main finding of the paper underscores that positive perceptions regarding community
behavior can encourage individual COVID-19 compliance protocols. Additionally, affirmative
perceptions regarding community are seen to sustain private compliance effort over time even
with a potential fatigue effect and mobility restrictions that pose binding constraints on the
income earning ability in general. Our work thus reaffirms the importance of social beliefs and
norms on individual health focused behavior that literature has often focused on (Cialdini and
Goldstein, 2004; Bicchieri, 2017; Van Bavel et al. 2020). Notably, literature on Ebola epidemics
and even non-contagious ailments like HIV/ AIDS that documents outreach interventions
facilitated through local community organizations led to increased awareness, contained the
spread of the virus and lowered stigma (Gregson et al., 2013; Abramowitz et al. 2015; Pronyk et
al. 2016). Community focused measures were recommended in other studies that have
highlighted the role of norms in collectivistic cultures in predicting SARS-preventive behaviors
(Chen and Ng, 2006).

The underlying implication of our results highlights the need for behavioral change
interventions that use influential individuals from the local community to exert social pressure or
incentives to sustain compliance. Social distancing measures and wearing masks are positive
behaviors that should be made visible and salient so that it can stabilize a norm through visual
cues. In this context, social media platforms can be used to engage peers and broadcast the use of

masks and safety measures. If more people see their neighbors in their community wear masks
and talk about staying at home during the pandemic, it might increase one’s willingness to do the
same. Such community level interventions may be more cost effective compared to individual
level monitoring and vigilance and also less likely to raise mistrust and antagonism against the
implementing authorities.
Importantly, our findings also signify the effectiveness of sensitization through
community especially for individuals with pre-existing co-morbidities. As COVID infection
propensity and mortality are known to be higher among people with co-morbidities (Ejaz et. al.,
2020) community based interventions, in the light of our result, can be useful in reducing the
fatality rate. Hence such interventions should be targeted more in the local public health centres
or hospitals or even medicine shops where the likelihood of the co-morbid individuals visiting
remains higher. Focused interventions related to community compliance through posters or
periodic announcements in these places can be a good way to reinforce these motivations. While
our paper identifies the significance of community interventions, it must be noted the design of
such programs are largely contextual and constitutes an important future research agenda.

Along with these interventions that raise perception about community, targeted
educational and communication messages periodically stressing the need for abiding by the
pandemic protocol along with its relevance to the local community should be clearly stated. For
longer term benefits, stronger institutions and policies that promote harmony and cooperation
among the community members becomes pertinent. This becomes especially important in urban
areas where community ties are relatively weaker. Further because our empirical assessment
reveals that subsequent lockdown has reduced private compliance, imposing mobility restrictions
that impede community interactions can potentially constrain individual compliance. While
gauging the impact of deterrence measures like lockdowns on enhancing compliance and
comparing that with other government measures is beyond the scope of the paper, we note that as
a policy tool, lockdown may not serve to propagate voluntary protection effort and might even
dampen it.

The findings should be interpreted with certain caveats and limitations. First, without
exogenous variation in community compliance, we are unable to view the relationship between

individual abidance of protocols and perception about community compliance from the causal
lens. Though we account for the potential OVB, concerns about reverse causation remain valid.
Secondly, snowball sampling and usage of social platforms raise concerns regarding the
representativeness of the sample particularly if sections of the populations without smart phones
are systematically excluded from the sample. Further, self-reported data on compliance, might
also be associated with substantial upward bias. Nevertheless, given unprecedented nature of the
outbreak and subsequent lockdowns, we feel these findings provide insight on an importance
issue regarding compliance.

7. Conclusion
This paper examines the relationship between perceived community compliance and individual
abidance to the COVID-19 compliance protocols. We find that community influence reinforcing
individual compliance in data collected across India from April to May, 2020 during the
lockdown. The heterogeneous effects indicate higher effects of the community over time and
also on co-morbid individuals. Based on these findings, we highlight a number of policy
recommendations based on using community networks to foster collective action that can raise
compliance and arrest the growth of the infection. Apart from the policy implication, the paper
assumes contextual importance as India is currently among those countries with the highest
number of new infection and deaths.
