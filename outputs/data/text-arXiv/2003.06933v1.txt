Abstract
The 2019-Novel-Coronavirus (COVID-19) has affected 116 (By March 12) countries and out of more
than 118,000 confirmed cases. Understanding the transmission dynamics of the infection in each
country which affected on a daily basis and evaluating the effectiveness of control policies is critical
for our further actions. To date, the statistics of COVID-19 reported cases show more than 80 percent
of infected had a mild case of disease, while around 14 percent of infected experienced a severe one
and about 5 percent are categorized as critical disease victims. Today’s report (2020-03-12; daily
updates in the prepared website) shows the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, South Korea,
Italy, and Iran are 80932, 7869, 12462 and 10075; respectively. Calculating the total Case Fatality
Rate (CFR) of Italy (2020-03-04), about 7.9% of confirmed cases passed away. Compared to South
Korea’s rate of 0.76% (10 times lower than Italy) and China’s 3.8% (50% lower than Italy), the CFR
of Italy is too high. There are some effective policies that yield significant changes in the trend of
cases. The lockdown policy in China and Italy (the effect observed after 11 days), Shutdown of all
non-essential companies in Hubei (the effect observed after 5 days), combined policy in South Korea
and reducing working hours in Iran.

Introduction
Human coronaviruses (HCoV) which causes gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections, were first introduced by the
discovery of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, from the nasal cavities of human patients with the common cold, in 1960s
(Myint, 1994 [19]; Tyrrell & Bynoe, 1966 [27]). Other discovered human coronaviruses, which have involved serious
respiratory tract infections, include SARS-CoV (2003), HCoV NL63 (2004), HKU1 (2005), MERS-CoV (2012), and
the latest one, SARSCoV-2 (2019) resulting in Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)(Lim, Ng, Tam, & Liu, 2016 [15];
Syed, 2020 [26]). The name refers to the morphology of the virus, when viewed under 2D transmission electron
microscopy (large pleomorphic spherical particles with bulbous surface) and stems from the Latin word "corona",
meaning "crown"(Goldsmith et al., 2004 [9]). Concerning the risk factor, HCoVs vary significantly; from the relatively
harmless ones (i.e., common cold) to the most lethal ones (MERS-CoV, with more than 30% mortality rate in the
infected) (Fehr & Perlman, 2015 [7]). CoVs spread during cold seasons and cause colds with major symptoms, i.e.,
fever, sore throat, and less commonly pneumonia and bronchitis for the more aggressive strains. To date, there are no
vaccines or antiviral drugs capable of preventing or treating HCoV infections (Fehr & Perlman, 2015 [7]; Forgie &
Marrie, 2009 [8]; Liu et al., 2017 [16]).
To date, several outbreaks of coronavirus-related diseases have been reported. Severe acute respiratory syndrome- or
SARS was the first coronavirus-related outbreak, starting in Guangdong, China, in November 2002, and spread to a
total of 29 territories, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Canada, Singapore, Vietnam, and the United States, within 9
months. It infected a total of 8,098 people and killed 774 worldwide (Smith, 2006 [25]). The second coronavirus-related
outbreak happened in the Middle East in April 2012, officially named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or MERS.
This virus was first identified in a patient from Saudi Arabia, and later, MERS affected several other countries, including
Saudi Arabia, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Qatar, and Oman. Overall resulting with infections in 24
countries, with over 1,000 cases and over 400 deaths (Organization [23]). The outbreak of MERS happened again in
South Korea, supposedly from a traveler from Middle East. It happened during May and July 2015, and infected a total
of 186 individuals, with a death toll of 36 (Organization, 2015 [24]). After 3 years in August 2018, the next MERS
outbreak happened in countries on the Arabian Peninsula, and resulted in almost 147 infected people and the death of
47. The MERS outbreak had been reported in Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom, and South Korea.
In Dec 2019, a pneumonia outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China, and on Dec 31, it was attributed to a new strain of
HCoV, first named as 2019-nCoV by World Health Organization (WHO), and later renamed to SARS-CoV-2 by the
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Almost 2 weeks later, on Jan. 11, 2020, Chinese state media reported
the first fatality from the new discovered virus, that led to infection of dozens more. As of Jan 20, multiple countries
reported their first cases, including Japan, South Korea and Thailand. The first confirmed case in the United States came
the very next day in Washington State. Continuing its spread, Coronavirus presence was confirmed throughout the
month of February in the Philippines (Feb 2), France (Feb 14), Iran (Feb 21), and as reports started in Italy on Feb 23;
many more Europeans countries followed suit, reporting their first confirmed cases. As of this writing, the coronavirus
has affected 116 (By March 12) countries, out of more than 118,000 confirmed cases, around 4,000 people have lost
their lives. With China, Italy, Iran, and South Korea experiencing the worst cases of outbreaks and showing no sign of
alleviation, the 2019-2020 outbreak of COVID-19 is now officially recognized as a pandemic by WHO. An outbreak or
epidemic often refers to a sudden increase in the occurrence of an infectious disease, in a particular time and place.
Pandemics are near-global epidemic outbreaks, where multiple countries across the world are involved (Green et al.,
2002 [11]).
The mentioned rapid trend of spread prompts a lot of concerns and questions such as; "How fast is the virus spreading?",
"which policies or efforts could control the disease better?", and "what is the main difference of COVID-19 outbreak
with pervious epidemics?" Fortunately, the daily case detection changes are available and can be tracked almost in
real time on the website provided by authors (http://iuwa.ir/corona/). The aim of this study is to provide the
transmission trend from China to other countries and to report the daily confirmed cases, case fatalities and surveillance
in every countries from the first day of outbreak until March 4th. Also, to evaluate the effect of each government policies
in controlling the outbreak of COVID-19.

Methods
Basic Statistics
COVID-19 has spread to 85 countries (By March 4) and most national authorities have failed to keep it’s rapid spread
contained [6]. WHO (World Health Organization) reports that it began in Wuhan city, located in Hubei Province of
China, first reported on 21 January [20]. COVID-19 categorizes in three distinctions concerning it’s infected host’s
severity of disease [10] [17]. To date, the statistics of its reported cases shows more than 80 percent of infected had
a mild case of disease, while around 14 percent of infected experienced a severe one, suffering from breathlessness
and pneumonia. And about 5 percent are categorized as critical disease patients, their symptoms include septic shock,

respiratory failure, and the failure of more than one organ.
Reports on March 10 2020 show that China has the most confirmed, fatal and also recovered cases. The order of
confirmed cases after China’s, is followed respectively by South Korea, Italy, and Iran; which could be found in the
table1.
Confirmed death cases caused by COVID-19 are also observed in 37 (By March 12) different countries, lead in numbers

COVID-19 spread exists in all continents.
Finding Linear Relations
There isn’t much known at the moment about COVID-19, so there is a small amount of data about its comprehensive
effects and behaviors. In this study, relations are assumed to be linear, when, initially the drawn plot shows obvious
linear relations and secondly, the fitted linear regression line had a small enough error to preserve the values given
and the linear regression results could be interpreted with relative ease. In addition, by fitting regression lines with
higher order, causes overfitting, resulting from the amount of data. There is no evidence yet, about the relation of other
conditions to the outbreak and its case fatality rate (CFR), so by using linear regression line, policies and behaviors
could be compared. In the prediction cases, by using linear regression, we could compare future trends of countries in
earlier stages, with the ones in later stages. By considering above mentioned statements, we will find the best linear
relation between arrays of data. In some cases, the linear relation could be observed but it may exhibit linear relation
with some date shift of others (i.e. death cases should have linear relation with earlier values of confirmed cases, given
the fact that it should take time from confirmation to death.)
CFR could be calculated by the following formula:
CF R =

Death (T )
Conf irmed (T − dt)

In which Death and Conf irmed functions will calculate the value of death cases and confirmed cases at that date, T
being the date we want to inspect the CFR, dt is the mean duration of confirmed to death.
Global Daily Statistics
Figure 2a shows the global confirmed, deaths and recovered cases’ trend for COVID-19 form Jan 22 to March 10,
2020. Death cases are excessively lower than confirmed ones, so we normalized (By dividing the value of Confirmed,

confirmed cases, there is a huge increase since Feb 11, the increase tones down from Feb 11 to the next day, Furthermore
on Feb 13 another sharp increase is reported. It could be observed in Fig. 2b which shows new cases for each day (and
normalized in Fig. 2d ). The most reliable speculation for this jump is that in that day, China (the country with the most
confirmed cases) for the first time, reported the clinically diagnosed cases in addition to laboratory-confirmed cases [21],
in which 13332 clinically diagnosed cases are added to 1148 laboratory-confirmed ones. Since then, China has kept the
same reporting method for the confirmed cases. On 23rd and 24th of Feb, again the decrease of new cases subsided and
new cases increased as before. As shown in Fig. 2a the reduction trend is continued (approximately) and the cause of
the increase was other countries’ growing numbers. So, for more accurate analysis each country will be investigated
separately.

Results
China Daily Statistics
Wuhan city located in Hubei Province is reported to be the origin of COVID-19. On January 23 2020, a lockdown in
Wuhan and other cities in Hubei was implemented to control the outbreak of the COVID-19. A total of 12 other cities in
Hubei, consisting of Huangshi, Jingzhou, Yichang, Xiaogan, Jingmen, Suizhou, Xianning, Qianjiang, Xiantao, Shiyan,
Tianmen, and Enshi, restricted any form of transportation by the end of January 24. These decisions were made to
prevent the expansion of COVID-19 any further.
Confirmed Cases
As measured in [2], the incubation period for Wuhan travelers estimated from 2.1 to 11.1 days (The mean incubation
period was estimated to be 6.4 days), and also generally the mean incubation period was estimated at 5.2 days which
distributed in intervals of 4.1 to 7.0 with 95% confidence [14]. By adding these two values, 11.6 days after Jan 24 (4th
and 5th of Feb) the effects should be clearly manifesting.
Figure 3b depicted the new daily confirmed cases of China outside of Hubei. The peak of the plot is located on Feb
13 and the daily new cases reduces afterward. This reduction shows that the lockdown plays a serious role in the
further reduction of cases in China(excluding Hubei province). Even Though there is no reason to argue the lockdown’s

positive impact on Hubei itself, the decrease in new confirmed cases (Feb 13 increase’s rationale was described in the
previous section) shows that emergency circumstances and movement limitations yields positive results to the reduction
of confirmed cases from 10th of Feb. Since February 13 2020, the Chinese government has issued shutdown of all
non-essential companies, including manufacturing plants, in Hubei Province. 5 days later, on Feb 18, a drop of new
cases could be observed (Fig. 3b). Finally, the confirmed new cases in China were negligible from 1st of March.

Deaths
The number of deaths is far lower than confirmed cases. So, to investigate the relation of confirmed cases trend with the
CFR, the normalized plot will be investigated. By observing normalized Hubei province plot of confirmed deaths
and recovered cases in Fig. 3k, it could be seen that the CFR trend behaves the same as the confirmation, with a shift
(In date). Visually, it could be seen that the value of shift in date varies and increases during this time. In earlier
cases, the period of confirmation cases leading to death was shorter. It seems, one reason for this variation is, that
confirmed cases consist only of just laboratory cases, and by adding clinically diagnosed cases (which existed before
but didn’t count beforehand) the time of confirmation to death increases. In other words, the number of confirmed
cases gets closer to the real value, and the cases are announced sooner than they did before. Other possible reasons
include, the advancements in developing treatments, further delaying fatal cases, and the increase in public awareness,
as more people with possible signs of infection come forward to be diagnosed. To estimate the expected value of
confirming a case up to the death stage, assuming a linear relation between the death and confirmed rates, we draw
a linear regression line for confirmed and death cases’ value, Each time increasing the duration and finding the
mean absolute error (MAE) of the regression line. Normally, by increasing the duration, following the reduction in
investigated points, the MAE is reduced. However if there is an obvious relation between these two parameters, at
the point which they had a correlating relation, MAE will begin to increase (Fig. 4a). Wang et al. estimated the
time from the the appearance of first symptoms to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission 7.0 days, and to
ARDS 8.0 days [28]. Another study, found that the median days from the first symptom to death as 14 (range 6-41)
days [29]. As seen in Fig. 4c this value is about eleven in China (excluding Hubei province), Fig. 4e depicted the
value 5 for Hubei and Fig. 4a depicted the value is 6 days for China. Assuming the hospital admission is the same day
as confirmation (or a day before confirmation) the mean total of 14 days from the first symptom could be approved
in [29]. By finding the mean day from confirmation to death, it is possible to find out the CFR in China, Hubei and
China(excluding Hubei province) (algorithm 1 reports best shifting date value and best linear regression line). To
find CFR of March 4th for Hubei, confirmed cases on March 4 should be divided by death cases of 5 days before
that date (which is Feb 28) returning 4.4%. Calculating CFR for China (excluding Hubei) on March 4, follows as
confirmed cases on the same day divided by death cases of 11 days before that date (Feb 22) that equals 0.9%; Fi5

nally, for China’s CFR on March 4, dividing March 4th confirmed cases by death ones of 6 days prior (Feb 27) yields 3.8%.

Recovered
Recovered cases are defined active cases-patients recovered after a certain amount of time, with its trend seen in Fig.
3k, Fig. 3j and Fig. 3l . By comparing recovered cases with confirmed ones, a relation is observed after date shifts.
Unlike death cases, recovered cases’ shift are longer initially, and reduces over time. The assumed reasoning is that by
the passing of time, more medical treatments develop, healthcare providers gain more experience in handling patients’
care and as more people are informed, increasing numbers of them check in hospitals at the early stages of their disease,
resulting in an even more efficient treatment. However this reduction doesn’t break the linear relation between confirmed
cases and recovered ones enough to be significant. To find the mean date shift between confirmed cases and recovered
ones, we apply a linear regression line to different dates by shifting them back until a first local minimum MAE is
found(algorithm 1). Hubei province’s recovered mean duration value found is 12 days Fig. 4f, the same value for
China(excluding Hubei province) is 14 days Fig. 4d, and finally for China it’s 12 days Fig. 4b. To find out the recovered
cases ratio of Hubei province at March 4th, recovered cases of March 4 are divided by confirmed cases of 15 days prior
resulting in 62.5%. Same calculation applies for China (excluding Hubei) 92.9%, and finally for China’s result 67.4%.

South Korea Daily Statistics
Confirmed Cases
First confirmed cases of COVID-19 was observed Jan 20th in South Korea, but the outbreak started around Feb 18th (29
days later), its death and recovered cases’ trend shown in Fig. 5a after normalizing, in addition the new cases’ real-valued
and normal form are also found in Fig. 5b . New confirmed, death and recovered cases are also depicted in Fig. 5c and
normalized in Fig. 5d . In Fig. 5e first 16 day of four country’s outbreak compared. New confirmed and death cases
also depicted in Fig. 5g and 5h.
Being one of the first countries reporting the outbreak of COVID-19, the first report was on Jan 20. However, no
outbreak was observed by Feb 18th, after which there was a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases.
Comparison between the growth trend in numbers from South Korea from this date with China’s in the early stages
is depicted in Fig. 5e as shown the growth rate patterns are approximately the same between the two, showing a very
similar behavior in the increasing numbers of confirmed cases. COVID-19 spreads from human to human [5], therefore
in addition to isolation of people, social avoidance and quarantine policies, faster detection of infected cases should
reduce further growth. Each infected individual, by having contact with others directly or by proxy, (in other words by
activity) could infect a number of people, so to reduce the odds of transmission of virus, faster detection of infected
individuals could play a key role alongside lockdown strategies.
Based on the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), as of March 8th 2020, a total number of
188,518 cases have been screened and tested for HCoV infection [13]. More than 10,000 tests had been taken on March
8th, and just in two days, this number has reached to 210,144 (indicating more than 20,000 tests had been taken in 2
days). At this date, South Korea reached to 4099 taken-tests per million people. The magnitude of this number clearly
shows the policy of South Korea, an attempt to reduce the duration of detection, through a faster detection strategy [30].
Furthermore, the fact that the CFR in the old South Korean affected adults [12] (patients above 70 years) is still lower
than that of Italian HCoV affected patients (average 47 years old), better signifies the role of early detection in controlling
the epidemic.
Deaths
To determine the CFR of confirmed cases, specially in countries in which the COVID-19 is spreading, the knowledge of
confirmation to death duration is essential. To demonstrate a wrong approach, if dividing the death cases by confirmed
ones on a specific date, yield the wrong answers, for the death cases might have been confirmed some day prior. By
assuming that CFR has a linear (or near linear) relation with confirmed rate, duration of confirmation to death could be
evaluated by fitting multiple linear regression lines. Minimum value for MAE appears for 3 days shift, meaning death
cases were confirmed 3 days before. To discern the CFR of South Korea, total death cases should be divided by total
confirmed date of 3 days prior (slope of the regression line also shows the rate).
As alluded to before, there are many types of COVID-19 with respect to acuteness of the disease. The CFR varies
depending on the level of infected people already confirmed. If a country manages to diagnose and confirm the affection
of a patient, in an earlier stage and begins curating the infected individuals, or tallying those with mild COVID-19, the
CFR would be comparatively lower. Such percussion alludes to the apparent lower CFRs in South Korea (77 out of
10,000) versus other countries with comparably large outbreaks.

Recovered
Due to the small duration of outbreak in South Korea and larger duration of recovery date, it is difficult to accurately
estimate the duration in this country. Considering the low CFR and a huge reduction of new cases in South Korea, the
only remaining concern is the low rate of recovered cases.
Predictions
Figure 5e displays the confirmed cases of South Korea with the ones in early stages of outbreak in China, with a
comparably similar incremental trends (the relation was assumed to be linear relation between the two). to demonstrate
this linear relation with a shift in date shift, we will follow the same as before. By fitting a regression line, it could be
estimated which date shift yield the lowest error (which is 0 date shift). Owing to the fact that China has experienced the
COVID-19 after these fitting trends, it is possible to predict South Korea’s next trend, assuming South Korea’s policies
are as good as China’s (Since other conditions like race and climate are comparatively the same ). As mentioned before,
China on Feb 13 (22 days after the outbreak), added clinical diagnosis cases to laboratory-confirmed cases, so it seems
appropriate to be considered in predictions, after normalization. Following the evaluation of the number of days shift,

Italy Daily Statistics
Confirmed Cases
Italy reported its first confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection on Jan 31, later announcing an outbreak around Feb 21st
(21 days later). We have displayed (after normalizing) overall analysis in addition to death and recovered cases’ trend in
Fig. 6b depicted the COVID-19’s trend in the country. By normalizing the plot, death and recovered cases’ trend could
be seen in Fig.6b.
The plot for new cases also figured in Fig. 6c in real-valued and normal form. Comparison between the growth trend
in numbers from Italy from this date with China’s in the early stages is depicted in Fig. 6d as shown, the growth rate
patterns are approximately the same between the two for first 14 days, showing identical behavior in the increasing
numbers of confirmed cases. After day 14th, Italy exhibits incremental increase in confirmed cases juxtaposed to China’s.
March 10 (17th day of Italy’s outbreak) being Italy’s initial quarantine date, means it is too early to observe this policy’s
effects. Lombardy, the center of outbreak in Italy was locked down on February 22 and this lockdown strategy seems to
have had a positive effect on other municipalities depicted in Fig. 6i and by comparing other municipalities confirmed
cases with China’s (The mainland) trend shown in Fig.6h , results seem identical.
To analyze the stage of the disease in the Italian HCoV infected patients (i.e., to find out how rapid the infected people
have been screened and diagnosed), the results of the COVID-19 tests of Italy and South Korea can be compared. South
Korea has been considered as a reference as its HCoV-related CFR is low enough, indicating that both countries are at the
same level of HCoV infection. Till March 10th 2020, a total of 60,761 HCoV tests had been taken form Italians- through
their screening program, where as in South Korea this number exceeds 210,144 tests, more than 3 folds. However, the
number of the daily taken tests in Italy has been increasing, i.e., it was 13000 on March 11th [3].
Deaths
By comparing new cases of Italy and China which manifested in Fig. 6e (and the overall CFR comparison of the
two in Fig.6g), it is clear that new death cases of Italy increased next to China’s. Calculating the total CFR of Italy
(confirmation to death duration calculated as 2 days) about 7.9% of confirmed cases passed away. Compared to South
Korea’s rate of 0.76% (10% lower than Italy) and China’s 3.8% (50% lower than Italy), the CFR of Italy is too high.
Ignoring race and climate as conditions (in which there is no clue of their impact), there should exist a strong rationale
for this difference. One hypothesis is that some infected individuals are not diagnosed until later more serious stages of

the disease. This could also explain the increase in confirmed cases, suggesting those infected, remain in contact with
others. By comparing hospital beds per 10000 people, the indicator was 115.32 (At 2014), 42 (At 2012) and 34.22 (At
2012)(Iran 15 2014) for South Korea, China and Italy, respectively [22]. Statistically, it is observed that the CFR of
COVID-19 has had a direct relation with age (with the average age of death for these 3 countries respectively 28, 38 and
47 years old [31]) and It also potentially contributes to the increase in CFRs.
Predictions
Using the home quarantine strategy in Italy should fit the trend of China, with the decrease of new cases, at latest
predicted to start on March 15. Comprehensively inspecting signs of the infection in people and faster starting treatment
could also help lower CFR and make Italy’s COVID-19 CFR more realistic.
Other Countries Daily Statistics
Iran
COVID-19 was first reported in Iran starting with 2 dead cases on 19th of Feb in Qom (a city near Tehran, Iran’s capital),
followed immediately by a huge outbreak, displayed in Fig. 7a detailing its number of confirmed, deaths and recovered
cases, and normalized in Fig. 7b. Officially, Iran hasn’t mandated any city wide lockdowns, but recently some provinces
are refusing non-local travelers. Regarding the experiences in China, lockdown strategy will isolate cities to avoid

transmitting the growth rate to other cities. However, such policies entail some negative consequences, and therefore
they were not implemented in early stages of the outbreak in Iran; in contrast to Italy and South Korea, where there
was a gap between outbreak and huge outbreak (21 and 27 days). On the 10th day of outbreak in Iran, total reported
confirmed infected individual cases reached 388.
To find confirmed to death cases mean duration, as before, we calculate the minimum MAE, assuming there is a linear
relation between these two. Linear regression algorithms shows the date shift should be zero, which means on average,
death cases confirmed at the same day. By comparing the death trend with confirmed cases in Fig. 7b and Fig. 7d, it
is obvious that the trend of CFR was not linear. The reported death vs confirmed are too excessive at early days. It is
possible that the shortage of COVID-19 testing kits or/and the lack of clinical diagnosis approach caused such unreliable
data. Countries at this stage mostly had about 2 days of confirmation to death period, so following this assumption the
COVID-19’s CFR in Iran is around 4.4%.
By observing the 24th of Feb’s report, there were 49 active cases (The cases which are not recovered or dead but
confirmed as a COVID-19 infected) reported (at least 14 cases are new) and the value for active cases in the next day
was 79 (at least 30 new cases). Two days later, the reported recovered cases was 49. Supposing no one was treated in
less than two days, this results in 100% recovery of 14 new cases in two days and also no active cases after two days,
marking a great experience which was reported by Iran’s officials. Otherwise, some cases were treated in one day. This
makes Iran’s phenomena intriguing for investigating the details and contributing factors for such cases in order to find
a relation between individual’s physical conditions and their treatment period. However, errors in report could also
explain this information. Using regression line to find the mean recovered duration shows that the recovery duration for
Iran should be around 1 day, Also seen in Fig. 7c, the rate of recovery in Iran is quite significant at 38% (keep in mind,
Iran is in early stage of COVID-19’s growth).
Figures 7e, 7f, 7g and 7h show Iran’s trends of confirmed, newly confirmed, death and new death cases respectively.
The trends display no linear relation, Therefore in order to find the linear relation, we fit Iran’s with China’s first 10 days
of confirmed, newly confirmed, death and new death cases respectively depicted in Fig. 7i, 7j, 7k and 7l.
The 10th day after the outbreak, was the day in which new cases of china started to decrease. in Contrast, Iran’s
incremental trend continued to rise until the 20th day of the outbreak, Even Though a temporal reduction in new cases
could be observed starting on 6th of March persisting until 9th of March. Evidently, it is the impact of a nation wide
implemented policy reducing working hours 6 days prior (5.4 days is the mean incubation period [2] ). After 4 days, with
the arrival of weekends and the following 2 additional holidays. Reports indicate, many people took trips during these
dates which is widely assumed as a reason for confirmed cases’ rise. Although many companies implemented forms of
remote work for their employees (which is estimated to have a positive impact on preventing the growth outbreak), yet
many governmental office working hours returned to their pre-outbreak times (naturally assumed to negatively impact
the prevention of disease’s spread ). There is yet no observable comparison between the effectiveness of either decisions,
however the aggregation of effects could be seen from March 15.
An important upcoming event in Iran is Nowruz which is the Iranian New Year, when traditionally, gatherings are very
common, which could have very serious consequences on the outbreak of COVID-19 in Iran, prompting immediate and
decisive preventive policies from the government.
Japan
The first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Japan returned from Wuhan on 6th of Jan. However, the outbreak in Japan
sped up on Feb 15. Fig. 8a shows the trend of outbreak after 15th Feb in Japan, while Fig. 8b is normalized to compare
Confirmed, Deaths and Recovered cases. The trend shows that the spread of COVID-19 in Japan behaves at a lower rate
than China’s first dates (see Fig. 8c). The number of deaths in Japan is also lower than (10 individuals on March 10) the
regression line could be fitted with a high degree of confidence, However it is estimated that it is about 2%. The CFR is
very good by adding the information of mean age in Japan, which is 48. By finding out the hospital per bed value of
Japan which is 134 (reported at 2012 WHO), the relation of death cases compared with hospital per bed is more clear.
Although Japan managed the early stage exponential rate of COVID-19 (see Fig. 8c), a reduction in new cases is not
observed (see Fig. 8d) so, it is speculative at best to say that Japan is in its final stages of the outbreak.
Spain
Massive levels of COVID-19 outbreak were reported around Feb 25 for Spain, as seen by its trend of confirmed, death
and recovered cases for demonstrated in Fig. 9a and its death and recovered cases in Fig. 9b. By comparing the early
stages of Spain with Iran, Italy and South Korea in Fig. 9c the trend since March 10 shows Spain has larger growth rate
than other ones mentioned here. Mean age of Spain is 45 years old and hospital beds per person in the country is 29.65
for every 10000 (At 2013), compared to Italy the mean age of Spain is slightly smaller while hospital beds per person
are relatively higher, consequently it is expected that the CFR should therefore be slightly lower. After calculating the
confirmed to death cases duration which is 3 days the CFR of Spain results in 7% for Spain, as expected.

France
France underwent two increments in its rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases. The first one was on Feb 25, therefore
chosen as the starting point of the outbreak. Second was from 3rd to 5th of March as shown in Fig. 10a. By normalizing
data displayed in Fig. 10b and calculating the confirmed to death duration which is 3, CFR for France at March 10
results in 3.5%. Considering the mean age as a parameter, which in France is lower than Spain (42 and 45 respectively)
in addition to beds per person which is 64.77 (At 2013) [22] (Higher than Spain) , CFRs are expected to be lower than
Spain. By comparing the growth of confirmed cases with China, Iran, Italy and South Korea depicted in Fig. 10c , it’s
evident that although COVID-19 in France didn’t exhibit a fast rate similar to Iran in the first 14 days of the outbreak, it
is predicted however that the CFR will increase as much as Italy’s.
Germany
By observing the Fig. 11a and comparing the trend with China, Italy, Iran and South Korea, which is depicted in Fig.
11b, Germany had same COVID-19 trend as all others except Iran, which is not a bad news for Germans, but better ones
comes when we want to calculate CFR. Total number of deaths in Germany since 10th March is 2. Which is obvious,
that the regression approach could not help to find confirmed to death duration. So, like other countries in this stage, we
take it as 3 days. By dividing the deaths of 10th march to confirmed of 7th march the 25 out of 10000 (0.25%) is the
CFR, which is too low at this stage.
The USA
The USA’s confirmed, death and recovered COVID-19 cases trend is depicted in Fig. 12a, as well as its normal form in
Fig. 12b. On March 10 both the confirmed and death cases of the USA increased (about 2.9 and 2.5 times respectively)
The recovered cases also increased 2.1 times, but due to its low number of recovered (15 on March 10) we considered it

trivial. The huge increase in death and confirmed cases lead the regression line algorithm to define confirmed to death
duration in 0 days. However, it wouldn’t be possible unless most dead cases are confirmed after death. Accepting the 3
days for the USA, like other countries in this stage, the CFR should be about 14% which is too high for a country with
38 years old mean age and 29 hospital beds per person. The high CFR could be alluded to the detection of the infected
individuals during the last stages of the illness, or reporting on serious cases with higher CFRs exclusively. Compared to
China, Iran, Italy and South Korea, both confirmed and death cases of the USA shows higher orders of incrementation.
It is advisable to follow the USA in the coming days for more accurate information gathering, considering the latest
increment could be caused by wrong data in the previous dates.

Discussion
The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), epi-centered in Hubei Province of the People’s Republic of
China, has spread to many other countries. The case detection rate is changing daily and can be tracked in almost real
time on the mentioned website.
Reports on March 10 2020 show that reports show that China has the most confirmed, fatal and also recovered cases and
in the terms of confirmed cases, South Korea, Iran, and Italy are following the Chin, respectively. Confirmed death
cases lead in numbers by China and followed respectively by Italy, Iran, and South Korea. The daily statistics showed
that lockdown are effective in reduction of incidence of confirmed cases with COVID-19 after about 11 days in China.
South Korea, is one of the first countries reporting the cases after China and the growth pattern of confirmed cases is
the same as China’s in early stages. However, they implement some policies such as in addition to isolation of people,

social avoidance and quarantine policies, and faster detection of infected cases which were effective in decrease in new
confirmed case and also case fatality. Italy and China have the approximately same growth rate patterns for first 14 days.
Although it is too early to observe quarantines policy’s effects in Italy, lockdown strategy of Lombardy (the center of
outbreak in Italy) seems to have had a positive effect on other municipalities. Unlike to China’s growth pattern, Iran’s
incremental trend continued to rise until the 20th day of the outbreak, Even Though a temporal reduction in new cases
could be observed due to a nation wide Implemented policy reducing working hours. The case fatality rate in China was
3.8% (for Hubei was 4.4%). The highest and the lowest case fatality rate are belongs to Italy (7.9%)(and South Korea
(0.76%), respectively. Which represent the effectiveness of their policies in control of the COVID-19.
Social distancing was one of the most effective policies to control past epidemic disease by limitation human to human
transmission and reducing mortality and morbidity( [1], [4], [4]). However studies suggest that combination of multiple
policies can boost the effectiveness. For instance, New York City Department of Health implement different policies
during the influenza pandemic in 1918-19 at the same time and they have the lowest rate of mortality on the eastern
seaboard of the USA [18].
During COVID-19 outbreak, researchers predicted that the mass movement of people at the end of the Lunar New
Year holiday, would increase the spreading of disease. Facing this concern, government of China implemented policies
which was helpful in control the disease such as, extended the holiday so the holiday would long enough to shelter the
incubation period of COVID-19, isolation of confirmed cases in hospitals, quarantining mild or asymptomatic persons
in different hospitals, home-based quarantine of people from Hubei province (epicenter of the epidemic), and the most
important one was to prevent individuals with asymptomatic infections from spreading the virus.( [14], [5]) Iran is facing
