Abstract
We present a System Dynamics (SD) model of the Covid-19 pandemic spread in India. The
detailed age-structured compartment-based model endogenously captures various disease
transmission pathways, expanding significantly from the standard SEIR model. The model is
customized for India by using the appropriate population pyramid, contact rate matrices,
external arrivals (as per actual data), and a few other calibrated fractions based on the
reported cases of Covid-19 in India. Also, we have explicitly modeled, using independent
time-variant levers, the effects of testing, contact tracing, isolating Covid-positive patients,
quarantining, use of mask/better hygiene practices, social distancing through contact rate
reductions at distinct zones of home(H), work(W), school(S) and other(O) locations.
Simulation results show that, even after an extended lock-down, some non-trivial number of
infections (even asymptomatic) will be left and the pandemic will resurface. Only tools that
work against the pandemic is high rate of testing of those who show Covid-19 like symptoms,
isolating them if they are positive and contact tracing all contacts of positive patients and
quarantining them, in combination with use of face masks and personal hygiene. A wide range
of combination of effectiveness of contact tracing, isolation, quarantining and personal
hygiene measures help minimize the pandemic impact and some imperfections in
implementation of one measure can be compensated by better implementation of other
measures.

1. Introduction
A mathematical model of Covid-19 pandemic in India, based on System Dynamics (SD)
methodology is presented. Our SD based epidemiological model explicitly captures the
disease progression pathways, intervention pathways, causal linkages, and assumptions.
Systems Dynamics approach has its origins in the study of industrial dynamics by Jay Forrester
of MIT, in the late 1950s. In 1960s and 70s, several seminal works such as Limits to Growth,
Urban Dynamics, and World Dynamics emerged. More recently, the C-ROADS World Climate
Policy model, developed using an SD approach to understand the long-term climate effects,
has been widely adopted.
SD Philosophy emphasizes capturing real world processes, causal pathways and endogenous
feedback. The structure of an SD model must correspond to real world entities at appropriate
level of abstraction and aggregation. The entity flows in the model must respect conservation
laws, resource constraints, and known delays in real life. The parameters of the model must
have a corresponding real-world interpretation and must come from domain knowledge, or,
when estimated from data, must fall within plausible range.
Our model is an extension of the classic SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered)
model (Anderson and May 1992). It is a compartmental model of the pandemic, wherein the
population is divided into various age group wise ‘compartments’ to indicate Covid-19 disease
progression and the interventions. Within each compartment, population is assumed to be
homogeneous without and spatial or temporal attributes. While there are a number of SIR
based models (Lourenco et. all. 2020; Ghaffarzadegan and Rahmandad 2020, MedRxiv 2020),
our model differs from them not just in much more detailed modeling of various stages of
disease progression, but also differs in explicit modeling of quarantining and isolation of both
symptomatics and asymptomatics under key interventions of Testing and Contact Tracing.
We also have a much more detailed model of the healthcare subsystem that is absent in
almost all other models. Unlike (Ghaffarzadegan and Rahmandad 2020), we do not assume
any seasonality effect of temperature and humidity since the evidence on it is thin and we
would rather be conservative.
Given the time pressure, rapidly evolving data and uncertainties about virus infectivity and
duration of various disease progression stages, SD is a good choice for evaluating policy
interventions since it allows easy enlargement of model boundaries to incorporate hygiene
practices, healthcare staff shortage, and behavioral feedbacks. The accuracy of absolute
numbers generated by the model depend greatly on how accurate structural assumptions,
assumed/estimated parameters, and input data, are. As long as the parameters and input
data get the relative numbers and trends right, we can compare the relative impact of various
policy interventions and learn which interventions or intervention combinations are most
likely to take the system to desired state. This is particularly critical when almost
simultaneously estimation of number of current infections in UK from very well-respected

2

research teams (Lourenco et. all. 2020; Ferguson et. al. 2020) differ by orders of magnitude.
Similar order of magnitude difference in number of infections are noted for Santa Clara
county in Califorina (Bendavid, et al. 2020)
SD framework makes incorporating behavioral feedback possible. For example, as the
number of infections cases rise, people may adopt better personal hygiene. Behavioral
feedback is also important to model the counter-intuitive behavior of social systems and
possible policy resistance. The success of a prolonged lockdown may come at the cost of
wearing people down and they may stop following any containment measures resulting in a
much worse second wave of pandemic. Also, the strict Covid-containment measures may
inflict high collateral damage from other diseases. The devastating economic impact of strict
measures may make people desperate and more vulnerable if their health and nutritional
levels suffer. Due to time pressure many such scenarios are not incorporated here but must
be kept in mind when making policy choices.
The rest of the report is organised as follows. First, we list out the assumptions as they also
define the ability of our model. Next, we broadly describe our proposed model, along with
the model validation/ usage of data. Third, we present our experimental findings based on
simulations for multiple states of India. We then conclude with a brief discussion of our
findings.

2. Modelling Assumptions
Like most models of SIR family, we also model the probability of movement of people from
one compartment to other in a given time-step as independent of the residence time. Hence
ours is a memory-less model in that residence time in each compartment is exponentially
distributed. However, note that infectiousness of an individual is not uniform between
exposure and recovery. It is initially negligible and gets hold up to 48 hours before the
symptoms set in (Bai et. al. 2020; He and Lou et. al. 2020). As suggested in (Jacquez and Simon
2002), we take care of the limitations of the exponential distribution by introducing by
breaking ‘infectious’ compartment in exposed, asymptomatic infectious, and Infectious
symptomatics.
General assumptions with regards to our model are as follows:
• The population is assumed to be homogeneous and well-mixed. And there is no
significant change on the total population due to births and deaths.
• The population (people) interacts at various locations that can be broadly divided into
four sphere/ zone: at home, at work, at school and at other locations.
• The interactions are age-dependent. For example: we can expect high interaction
among 5-20 year olds at schools, while 30-60 year olds may interact more at work.

Patients infected by the coronavirus take some time (incubation period of ~ 5 days)
before they show any symptoms. During this asymptomatic/ pre-symptomatic phase,
they are assumed infective a few days prior (~24 to 48 hours prior) to the onset of
symptoms.
Symptomatic individuals may recover after a mild illness, or become serious and
require hospitalisation. Serious patients may recover or can become critical (requiring
ventilator / ICU facilities). The critical patients can recover or, unfortunately, die.
The infectiveness of the asymptomatic individuals are assumed to be lower than that
of the symptomatic individuals.
Asymptomatic individuals may also recover from the disease without showing
symptoms.
The progression of the disease is age-dependent. Co-morbidity is assumed to be
implicitly captured by this.
The new cases are assumed to be detected only when the individuals are tested
positive. This happens when either, (i) mild symptomatic individuals are tested
positive, or (ii) the disease worsens and the patient seeks treatment at hospital, at
which point it in time, they are tested and found positive.

Assumptions with regards to India-specific pandemic progress are as follows:
• The data about state-wise daily reported cases, recovered patients, and deaths, was
obtained from www.covid19india.org.
• The disease is assumed to be imported to the country through arriving passengers only
(as per the ‘imported cases’ reported in above link).
• It is assumed that the weather & climatic conditions of India play no role in the disease
transmissions/ infectiousness. Also, it is assumed that the immunity level of Indians is
similar to the people across the globe; and vaccinations such as BCG etc does not affect
the infectiousness of the disease.
• Lockdown is assumed to reduce the interaction at work and other locations by 80% (with
the remaining 20% representing essential services and front-line workers), and also result
in 100% reduction in school zone interactions.
• The naïve ratio of the total number of deaths divided by the total cases reported, is at
3.4% for India which is very high. The case fatality ratio depends on the duration of illness
and is hard to estimate without accurate patient records. The high deaths reported in
India could be due to delay in seeking treatment by the patients (due to which the disease
might have progressed to critical state thus hastening death), or due to the prior medical
conditions of the patients, or due to delays in initial testing and reporting.
Other modelling assumptions:
• In national level ‘All-India’ model, the interaction among states is assumed to be implicit.
• The state level models are considered independent of each other, i.e., no interactions
among states is assumed.

Super spreader events are not explicitly considered.
Economic effects are not directly considered.
Once lockdown is lifted, no further imported cases are assumed to occur. This can be
thought of as a policy choice. While some researchers have argued that once community
transmission sets in, imported cases do not make much difference (Chinazzi et. al. 2020),
recent experience of Vietnam, Singapore and China seem to contradict it. Hence we take
no new import as a policy decision for the current scope of our work.

Definition Used:
• Infectivity: It represents the probability of an individual contracting the disease upon
interaction with an infected person.
• Contact Rate: It represents the average number of persons a person interacts with in
a day.
These two definitions are particularly important in that they relate to the concept of the
popular but often misunderstood R0, the basic Reproduction Number. It refers to the
expected number of individuals, a single infected individual directly infects when introduced
in a fully susceptible population, in absence of external interventions. Its average value is
computed as the product of the number of interactions per day between an infected and a
susceptible person, the probability of infection in such an interaction, and the duration where
the person stays infectious. Human to fomite (inanimate infectious objects) contacts are
usually not modelled separately and are supposed to be subsumed in these averages.
This tells us that to reduce disease transmission we can target any of the three components
of R0. Interventions like social distancing, quarantine, isolation, and lockdowns affect the
number of interactions, medical interventions can reduce the disease duration, while the use
of masks, PPE, and better hygiene can reduce the infectivity. Infectivity is thought to be a
property of the virus but it also depends on the intensity of the interactions (in addition to
the virus property, and immunity against virus, and other conjectures such as
temperature/humidity etc). Both the number of interaction and its intensity (as a function of
physical distance) is affected by population density. Hence both the social customs and
behaviours and spatial characters of a region will affect R0. All of this means R0 computed for
a region cannot be blindly used in another region. In this work, we address these issues by
calibrating the model for contact rates and impact of hygiene on infectivity.

3. Model Description
A high level stock-flow diagram of the proposed model is shown in Figure 1. We assume the
population of the region is age-stratified into M age-groups. The population within each age
group is divided into Susceptibles (S), Exposed(E), Asymptomatic infectives (A), Infectious
Symptomatic (I) cases, Hospitalised patients (H), Critical patients (C), Recovered (R) population

represented by causal variables shown in red color. Other causal variables, especially delays, are not shown to improve
readability.

Let’s consider the ‘primary flow’ of the diseases across the compartments, that is, ignoring
quarantine and isolations. The Susceptible (S) people get exposed to the virus from contact
with an infectious person. Initially all those exposed to virus are non-symptomatic and noninfectives, and become infective (but not symptomatic) only after a latency period of dEA days.
After another dAI days, these individuals develop symptoms and move to Infectious
Symptomatics compartment. The sum of dEA and dAI represents the average incubation
period, dP. The persons in Infectious Symptomatics compartment are said to exhibit mild
symptoms and are active in the community, and thus continue to transmit the virus. A
fraction of such mild cases recovers, while for others, the disease worsens resulting in
hospitalization (move to Hospitalised patients class). A fraction of the serious hospitalised
patients recovers, while the rest become critical requiring ventilator / ICU facilities (move to
Critical patients class). A fraction of the critical patients recover while the rest, unfortunately,
die. It is assumed that the Recovered patients and the Dead do not transmit the virus. Note
that the external seeding of the virus in the community is captured explicitly.
Now, suppose quarantining and isolations of infectious persons are possible. This is explicitly
captured by the flows out of the stocks A and I. The flow to the Quarantine and Isolation
stocks are modeled as governed by different control fractions. The flow of asymptomatics
from A to QA represents the proportion of persons who are quarantined either through
awareness efforts (represented by f1(t)) or contact tracing of a positive tested patients
(represented by fX(t)). The flow of asymptomatics from A to LA represents the proportion of

6

persons who are isolated after testing positive for Covid-19 though early tracing and testing
effort (represented by f2(t)). The quarantined/ isolated asymptomatics, either recovers, or
develop symptoms and proceed to the quarantined Symptomatic and Isolated Symptomatic
stocks. The flow of Infectious Symptomatics from I to QI represents the proportion of persons
who are quarantined through awareness efforts (represented by f3(t))). The flow of
symptomatics from I to LI represents the proportion of persons who are isolated after testing
positive for Covid-19 (represented by f4(t)). This, f4(t), represents the fraction of symptomatic
individuals who are identified during the initial stages of the symptoms itself. The
quarantined/ isolated symptomatics, either recover, or become serious and are hospitalised.
Note that the patients who are not quarantined or not isolated proceed along the primary
flow a described earlier. The flow equations are given by equations 22-52 in Appendix A. Also,
note that all the flows are governed by explicit delays between stages, some of which are
determined by the nature of the disease (viz., incubation period), while others are determined
by the intervention or control action (viz., testing delay).
The infection rate is governed by the contact rate (λ) and the infectivity (infection probability,
p), as shown in Equations 16-21 in Appendix A. The contact rate for an age-group is the sum
of all interactions of that age group with all other age groups across all contact locations
(home, work, school and other). It is assumed that a susceptible individual can get infected
upon contact with an Asymptotic infective, or Infectious Symptomatics person, including
those in quarantine and isolation. It is assumed that the relative infectivity of the
Asymptomatic infectives is only (1-k)% of the symptomatic infected class. Further, it assumed
that patients in hospitals and critical care are in perfect isolation and hence do not contribute
to the disease transmission.
Social distancing measures, such as school closures, lockdown, partial opening of work, etc,
are modeled using fractions uH(t), uW(t), uS(t), uO(t), which represent the time dependent
control measure imposed on contacts at home(H), work(W), school(S) and other(O) locations,
respectively. Reductions in the infectivity due to measures such as personal hygiene, usage
of PPE such as masks, etc., is modeled using fraction multiplier v(t) on the base infectivity
parameter p. Additionally, a time dependent adjustment factor y(t) is used as a multiplier of
contact rate, Cij. At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic there is typically little awareness about
the diseases, and hence little or no precautions are taken by the population. This can result
in an increased interaction, more than what would have otherwise been.
Further, in the model, the overflows that can possibly occur at hospitals is explicitly modelled.
The area shown by the dashed box in Figure 1 is expanded in the main model, as shown in
Figure 2. The overflows at hospitals and Critical care facilities are explicitly modelled to
capture the possible deterioration in the care due to overwhelming demand on the hospital.
The flows DPR, QDPR, LDPR, represent the ‘new arrivals’ to the hospitals, feeding into the
stock DH. Now, as per the available capacity (KH) at the hospital, that many patients are sent

7

immediately to the hospital stock H, while the rest are explicitly marked as overflow hospital
patients and moved to stock OH. (Note: both these class of patients could be physically at the
hospital itself). Similarly, the patients at the hospital (stock H), as their condition worsens, can
go to critical care facility if there is sufficient capacity (K C). If not, the patient ‘move’ to
overflow critical patients (OC). The OH patients can worsen (become critical) or recover,
where the fraction recovering could be lower than that for the regular ‘H’ patients. The OC
patients can die or recover, where the fraction recovering could be lower than that for the
regular ‘C’ patients.

5. Simulation and Model Validation
The model has been implemented using Vensim® Pro software. Some additional variables
have been included in the Vensim model, mainly to capture a few of the underlying equations
in parts. A simulation timestep of 0.0625 is used, with integration method of Euler. Results
are saved per day.
The model has been thoroughly debugged to avoid integration time step errors, and floating
point overflow caused by extreme small value (e.g. 0 in the denominator). The units have
been checked to ensure consistency. Variable names have been chosen so that the model is
understandable.
As part of model validation, direct structure tests have been conducted to ensure that
relations & assumptions in the model are based on accepted theories and all important
variables are included in the model. As per that, an essential feature included in our model is
that a coronavirus infected person undergoes an incubation period before symptoms show
up; and during the incubation period they are infectious (without showing symptoms) after a
latency period. Other aspects included, which goes beyond the standard SEIR representation
of Covid-19 are, the age-groups specific contacts across various contact zones or locations;
age specific progression of & recovery from the disease; and explicit representation of
quarantines and isolations. Behavior tests were conducted to ensure that the model behaves
as per accepted System Dynamics theory at various test conditions, extreme values and loop
knockouts.

6. Modelling the observed pandemic behaviour in India and Sensitivity
Analysis
A conscious decision was taken by the modelers to not fine-tune the parameter values to
exactly replicate the reported cases of Covid-19 in India, or to minimise some statistical
measure of error. Instead it was decided to replicate the trend in behaviour by estimating a
few parameters only (McCloskey and Ziliak 1996).
On the website www.covid19india.org, the India state-wise data on daily number of (newly)
reported cases based on test reports, daily number of recovered cases, and daily number of
deaths are reported. The first 3 recorded cases of Covid-19 infections were during Jan 30th –
Feb 3rd 2020, followed by a long hiatus. Since March 2nd 2020, India has been seeing new cases
reported daily. For modelling purposes the early February data is ignored. Also, the current
deaths reported in India is quite high vis-à-vis the reported cases, and compared to the fatality
rates reported in [CDC report]. This could be due to initial long delay in seeking proper
treatment, comorbidity conditions, etc. Hence it is decided to calibrate the model based on
the new cases reported only.
10

In our model, there are two pathways by which a new case of Covid-19 is identified/
confirmed via testing. One pathway is when the individual allows the disease to progress, and
seek medical help only when it becomes severe. This is captured by the flow Disease Progress
Rate (DPR) from Infectious Symptomatic (I) to Hospitalized Patients (H) compartments. Such
patients are tested positive late after the onset of the disease. The second pathway will be
to, via contact tracing, test some symptomatic individuals a priori before the symptoms
become severe. This is captured by the flow Isolating Symptomatics Rate (LIR) from Infectious
Symptomatic (I) to Isolated Symptomatics (LI) compartments. This is governed by the fraction
f4(t). Now, the data available in the website does not distinguish between the two pathways.
It is important to do so, since pathway 1 is reactive, while pathway 2 is a proactive approach.
It is assumed that pathway 1 is active be default, and hence only f4(t) is estimated in our
model.
As far as the authors are aware, there are no detailed published clinical studies of the cases
in India. In the absence of that, the parameters reported in Section 4.0 are assumed to hold
true for India. Also, India has already started various interventions to mitigate/ prevent the
pandemic spread. Based on reported studies and preliminary experiments, we decided
estimate the following parameters only to replicate the trend in the daily reported cases:
(i)
Control measures of uH(t), uW(t), uS(t), uO(t), to indicate the effect of lockdown.
Prior to lockdown they were set at 1. During lockdown, assumed that uH(t) = 1 and
uS(t)=0.
(ii)
The proportion f4(t) of symptomatic infectious individuals who are isolated after
testing.
(iii)
The fraction x(t) of asymptomatics traced and quarantined per fraction
symptomatic tested. Note that fraction of asymptomatics traced and quarantined
is given fx(t) = x(t)*f4(t).
(iv)
The time dependent adjustment factor y(t).
The parameters, f1(t), and f3(t), are assumed to be 0, implying that volunteer quarantining
through awareness doesn’t happen. Also, f2(t) is assumed to be 0, implying a no testing policy
of asymptomatic. Also, the time dependent control measure v(t) for better hygiene and PPE
use is kept at 1 to indicate no effect of this on Covid-19 spread in India.
Introduction of infected individuals in the community: Since the pandemic did not have
origins in India. The spread in India is due to arrivals of infected individuals from abroad. Now,
in the www.covid19india.org website (crowdsourced database available there), a few of the
cases has been tagged as ‘imported’. This is interpreted as those individuals who have arrived
from abroad infected. Since we do not have the information on the exact arrival date to India,
we assume that all these ‘imported cases’ came to India on an average of 7 ( 𝑑𝐴𝐼 + 𝑑𝐼𝐻 ) days
prior to being identified as positive. Thus, for example, the imported patients on March 2nd
is assumed to have arrived on February 24th. These imported cases arrivals is taken to define
the flow XAR(t). Also, lockdown is taken to start on 25th March 2020.

11

The results of model calibration exercise is shown in Figure 3 below, for the All India data. The
simulation duration was from 24th Feb to 14th April. It is observed that the new cases and
cumulative cases give a reasonable fit to the reported data of the pandemic’s spread in India.
Also, observe that the simulation over estimates the number recovered and underestimate
the number dead. Further calibration of recovered and dead based on current data only has
a grave risk of over-estimating deaths in future since it appears that people are approaching
hospitals very late when disease has progressed significantly. We assume that this scenario
will change as time passes. Also, in future we plan to take comorbidity and patient case details
for Indian conditions into account.

The parameter setting that resulted in the above behaviour are:
(i)
During lockdown, uH(t) = 1, uW(t)=0.3, uS(t)=0, uO(t) =0.3, and 1 otherwise.
(ii)

Next, sensitivity analysis of the model behaviour to the control parameters were performed,
the results of which are shown in Figure 4 below. The sensitivity settings are as follows:
(i)
uW(t) ~ UNIFORM(0.2, 0.4)
(ii)
uO(t) ~ UNIFORM(0.2, 0.4)
(iii)
f4(t) ~ UNIFORM(0.05, 0.5)
(iv)
The slope of y(t) ~ UNIFORM(0.8/35, 1/35)

It is observed that the model reasonably captures the reported trend even for changes in the
calibrated values. During the initial days, the model seems to overestimate the trend.
However, the more recent behaviour, especially post lockdown, is capture reasonably well.
Hence, it is decided to calibrate the model with the recommended parameters.

In a manner similar to what was describe for the all India data, the model was calibrated for
each state (thus each state has a separate model). The results of state-wise calibration are
shown in Appendix C.

7. Modelling the Interventions

Each of the above interventions are simulated at two settings of testing and tracing:
A. With increased testing (testing and tracing; 80% symptomatic can be identified and
isolated within one day of development of symptoms
• Modelled with f4(t) = 0.8, x(t) = 1, for t >= 15th Apr
• Testing delay dIL continues to be 2.5 days.
• v(t)=0.8, for t >= 15th Apr (minimal improved level of hygiene and masks usage)
B. Continue the same rate of testing
• Modelled with f4(t) = 0.25, x(t) = 0.1 for All India model. For all other states, the
obtained calibrated values are used.
• v(t)=0.8, for t >= 15th Apr (minimal improved level of hygiene and masks usage)
For the additional scenarios (policy 6 and 7) we have considered the following C and D
settings also.
C. Along with (A), improved use of Face Mask and Personal Hygiene
• Modelled with f4(t) = 0.8, x(t) = 1, for t >= 15th Apr
• Testing delay dIL continues to be 2.5 days.
• v(t) = 0.6, for t >= 15th Apr
D. Modified (A), improved use of Face Mask and Personal Hygiene, and lower
testing/tracing
• Modelled with f4(t) = 0.5, x(t) = 1 for All India model. For all other states, the
obtained calibrated values are used.
• Testing delay dIL continues to be 2.5 days.
• v(t) = 0.6, for t >= 15th Apr
Thus, a total of 18 intervention scenarios are considered (1A, 1B, 2A, …, 5B, 6A, 6B, 6C, 6D,
7A, 7B, 7C, 7D), for the all India model and for each of the States.

8. Simulation Results and Observations
The above interventions were encoded, and the model simulated for India as well as each of
the states. All simulations were run for a time period until June 30th 2020. Do note that it is
assumed that no new cases arrive at the state/ country from an external source in the above
simulation time period.
Figure 5 and 6 shows the simulation outputs for all India data for intervention scenarios 1A to
5B. Figure 5 shows that interventions 1B, 2B, 3B, 4B, and 5B (4B and 5B overlaps in figure)
are significantly more than their ‘A’ counterparts (all overlapping, along the x-axis). This

14

clearly shows that increased testing and tracing and isolating has a significant impact in
controlling the pandemic spread. Let’s zoom in (see Figure 6). It can be readily observed from
Figure 6 that once lockdown is lifted (any of the scenarios 1-5), the new cases reported will
increase exponentially (all ‘B’ scenarios). The policies 2A, 4A and 5A seem to result in low
spread of pandemic, with policy 4A being the least. Also, it is observed that all the ‘A’ policies,
1A to 5A will result in a short term increase in the number of reported cases. This is due to
the larger number of cases that gets discovered initially due to increase in the testing rates.

Figure 5: Simulation response based on India data (until June 30th 2020).

Figure 6 Simulation response based on India data (until June 30th 2020), Zoomed in. The lower three lines are 4A, 2A and 5A

The state-wise behaviour for polices 2A, 4A and 5A are show in Figures 7, 8 and 9 respectively.
All three policies show a similar trends in behaviour. It is observed from Figures that, as a
result of response either policy (2A, 4A or 5A), the pandemic is well controlled in all states.
However, MH and DL (top two lines) do show a relatively larger increase that the other states,
while in KA and KL (bottom two lines), the pandemic is completely under control. The
projected behaviour for all the other states are somewhere in between these extremes.

testing and tracing)

15th May 50% reduction in contacts; and increased testing and tracing)

Figure 9: Simulation output of state wise behavior for policy 5A (Extending the lockdown till May 15th; and increased testing

16

A few other policies have been evaluated (Policies 6A to 7D as mentioned in previous section).
Figure 10 compares the behaviour of policy 6C, 6D, 7C and 7D with policy 4A (the best so far).
It is readily apparent from the figure that policies 6C, 6D and (to some extent) 7C can help
mitigate the pandemic spread. These show better projected behaviour than policy 4A. This
shows that improved hygiene, social/ physical distancing, usage of masks and other protective
gear can be quite effective. Unlike policy 6C (where Home, work and other contacts are at
50% and schools closed), in policy 7C only schools are closed, while home, work and others
are back to ‘normal’. However, the relative deterioration is only marginal between 6C and 7C
(and still better than policy 4A). This again is due to improved hygiene, social/ physical
distancing, usage of masks and other protective gear. The practical implementation of this
policy remains to be seen. Figures 11 and 12 illustrate the state-wise response to policy 6C
and 7C respectively. Policy 6C (see figure 11) is effective in readily controlling the pandemic
spread. Although policy 7C (figure 12) shows an increasing rates, the growth is not
exponential but asymptotic (which is a good thing, means the pandemic will not go out of
control).
Do note that all the policies (such as increased testing/ contact tracing/ use of masks etc.)
discussed in this section are assumed to be working in perpetuity.

9. Summary and the Way Forward
For the Covid-19 pandemic in India, contrary to (Singh and Adhikari, 2020), our model shows
that, even after a 49-day lock-down, some non-trivial number of infections (even
asymptomatic) will be left and the pandemic will resurface. Only tool that works against the
pandemic is high rate of testing those who show Covid-19 like symptoms, isolating them if
they are positive and contact tracing all contacts of positive patients and quarantining them.
In combination with use of face masks and personal hygiene, contact tracing and isolation
need not be super accurate. A wide range of combination of contact tracing, isolation,
quarantining and personal hygiene measures keep the pandemic at bay and imperfections in
one sphere are easily compensated by better implementation of other measures. This works
if we keep just the schools closed for 90 days and allow all other activities with reasonable
social distancing (only 20% improvement compared to base is sufficient). This works well if
we open work but reduce non-essential contacts to half, while keeping schools closed for 90
days. Thus, we recommend that, during the lockdown, appropriate measures are put in place
to do effective contract tracing, testing and isolations, increase the awareness & responsibility
among the citizens to abide by social/ physical distancing norms, usage of masks and other
PPE, better hygiene practices, reduced discretionary trip and improved sanitisation. This is
will then help keep the pandemic in check while we can slowly reopen the economic activities.
A few immediate future works with regards to modelling, simulation and analysis are (not in
any particular order):
• State-wise sensitivity analysis of various policy levers to help the level of adherence/
enforcement of each (say, testing, contact tracing, hygiene, usage of masks, sanitisation,
contact rate reduction, physical distancing, etc.)
• Explore the impact of quarantining of symptomatics and asymptomatics though
awareness efforts.
• Explore the impact of isolating asymptomatics though testing. Currently policy is to test
only symptomatics.
• Use of patient case history to improving the model with respect to recovery delays,
resource use, comorbidity, etc.
• The changes in y(t) and v(t) to be made endogenous, driven by feedback of the local
reported cases and/or deaths.
• Understand and if possible, make explicit in the model the causes for policy resistance and
unintended consequences.
The Vensim model can be shared on request.

APPENDIX B: Contact Matrices and related notes.
We use the Social Contact Matrix from (Prem et. al. 2017). However, what we really need is
the number of interactions per day and not number of contacts and hence we calibrate the
model and apply a correction multiplier of 1.5 to all the base contact numbers for all four
spheres viz Home, Work School, and Other given there. Note that this factor of 1.5 is also an
artificial result of the fact that we take base infectivity to be .015 from (Singh and Adhikari
2020). Any change in the base infectivity number will have a corresponding impact on the
base contact correction multipliers.

APPENDIX C: Results of State-wise model calibration
State-wise calibration of the model. Only the plot of daily reported cases, and cumulative
reported cases given here. The blue lines represent the simulation results, and red line
shows the actual reported cases.
During lockdown, uH(t) = 1, uW(t)=0.3, uS(t)=0, uO(t) =0.3, and 1 otherwise for all states.
Some observations:
• Parameter settings for AP, GJ, JK, MP, MH, PJ, TL, and WB are same as All India.
• Parameter settings for DL, HR, TN are similar to each other; differs from All India only in
the starting value of y(t).
• In KA, KL, and RJ the testing fractions and contact tracing, f4(t) = x(t) = 0.5. This is
reasonable since Kerala model and Bilwara models haves been much praised for their
effective containment.
