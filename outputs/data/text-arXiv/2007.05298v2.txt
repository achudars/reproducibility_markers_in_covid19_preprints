In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of spherical droplets in the presence of a source-sink pair flow field. The
dynamics of the droplets is governed by the Maxey-Riley equation with Basset-Boussinesq history term neglected. We
find that, in the absence of gravity, there are two distinct behaviours for the droplets: small droplets cannot go further
than a specific distance, which we determine analytically, from the source before getting pulled into the sink. Larger
droplets can travel further from the source before getting pulled into the sink by virtue of their larger inertia, and their
maximum travelled distance is determined analytically.
We investigate the effects of gravity, and we find that there are three distinct droplet behaviours categorised by
their relative sizes: small, intermediate-sized, and large. Counterintuitively, we find that the droplets with minimum
horizontal range are neither small nor large, but of intermediate size. Furthermore, we show that in conditions of regular
human respiration, these intermediate-sized droplets range in size from a few µm to a few hundred µm. The result that
such droplets have a very short range could have important implications for the interpretation of existing data on droplet
dispersion.

INTRODUCTION

The transport of inertial particles in fluid flows occurs in
many problems arising in engineering and biology, such as
the build-up of microplastics in the ocean1 and respiratory
virus transmission through tract droplets2–4 . The MaxeyRiley equation5 describes the motion of a finite-sized spherical particle in an ambient fluid flow. The equation is a representation of Newton’s second law, in which the forces acting
on the particle include a Stokesian drag force, an added mass
force, a gravity force, the force due to the undisturbed flow,
and a Basset-Boussinesq history term. The equation takes the
form of a second-order, implicit integro-differential equation
with a singular kernel, and with a forcing term that is singular at the starting time6 . The equation has been applied to
model the dynamics of aerosol comprising particles of various density ratios7 , feeding mechanism of jellyfish8,9 , and the
dynamics of inertial particles in vortical flows10–12 . The equation has also been applied to droplet-laden flows with a phase
change at sub-Kolmogorov scales13 .
The Basset-Boussinesq term accounts for the drag due to
the production of vorticity as the particle is accelerated from
rest. It is difficult to include this term numerically, and is often omitted on the assumption that particles move in a quasistatic manner14 . This assumption breaks down in bubbly
and slurry flows, where the Basset-Boussinesq term accounts
14
for a quarter of the forces
 on the particle when density ratio R = 2ρf0 / ρf0 + 2ρp0 is greater than 2/3, where ρf0 is the

fluid density and ρp0 is the particle density. Recent advances15
have shown that the full Maxey-Riley equation can be represented as a forced, time-dependent Robin boundary condition
of the 1-D diffusion equation. Here, the authors found that a
particle settling under gravity relaxes to its terminal velocity
according to t −1/2 ; however, if the Basset-Boussinesq term is
neglected, it relaxes exponentially quickly16 .
In this paper, we examine the transport of inertial particles
in source-sink flows17 . Such a flow could represent the trajectories of water droplets emitted from coughing, sneezing2–4 ,
or breathing and in the presence of extraction, such as an airconditioning unit or air current18 . Our simplified mathematical model yields to analytic treatment in certain limits of large
and small droplets. This enables us to provide important physical insight into this complex problem, but we remark that effects such as drag non-linearity19 and turbulent dispersion20
are not taken into account. Since the dynamics of settling
droplets is significantly affected by their size, it is important
to understand the impact that the emitted droplet size has on
the destination of such a droplet in a source-sink flow. In particular, since droplets are vectors for infectious diseases such
as COVID-19, it is imperative that we understand the droplet
dynamics in such flows to mitigate the spread of the disease.
The paper is organised as follows: in Section II, the mathematical model is presented and non-dimensionalised. The
results are presented in Section III, for small (III A) and
intermediate-sized (III B) droplets in the absence of gravity.
Gravitational effects are considered for small droplets in III C
and for intermediate-sized droplets in III D. In Section IV, we
present applications of our results for human breathing without (IV B) and with (IV C) the inclusion of extraction. Finally,
we discuss our findings in Section V.

in, is generally much less than one. In the remainder of the
paper, we neglect the Basset history term since we anticipate
its magnitude is negligible compared to the Stokes drag term

Computational considerations

The resulting equations (8) are a set of three coupled second-order non-linear ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) for the position vector X(t). The algebra involved in
computing the material derivative in (8) is straightforward, but
cumbersome, and it is omitted here. This set of equations does
not admit analytical solutions in general, so it must be solved
numerically.
We solved the equations by expressing them as a system
of six first-order ODEs using the MATLAB R ode15s algorithm, a variable-step, variable-order solver based on the numerical differentiation formulas21 . This was performed on a
laptop equipped with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9980HK CPU
(2.40GHz) and 32GB of RAM; and each trajectory took on
average 0.015 seconds to compute. In each of our plots, we
show the trajectories emanating from 30 evenly-spaced points
on a circle centred at the origin (i.e., the source), giving a total
simulation time of approximately 0.45 seconds. The number
of trajectories was selected by balancing the requirements on
the detail on individual trajectories and the global behaviour
of the droplets. Such short simulation times allows us to identify the most important combinations out of a wide variation
of variables in a computational time that is several orders of
magnitude faster than models employing computational fluid
dynamics22 .

If we take x0 = [1, 0, 0], then the trajectory that emerges from
the source and travels in the direction of the negative x-axis
is the one that gets the greatest distance away from the sink.
Hence, let us consider this inequality in the first component,
and along the line y = 0, z = 0:

(12)

We are interested in where the flow field changes direction,
since this indicates the maximum distance droplets emitted at
the source can travel before moving towards the sink. To this
end, let us choose a point x = −λ along y = 0 and z = 0; then
this inequality tells us that

(13)

This inequality can hold only if γ > 1. This makes sense, since
flow is directed towards the sink only if the sink is stronger
than the source.
Figure 1 shows the trajectories for small droplets (St  R)
in the presence of a source-sink pair: the source is located
at the origin (green disk) and the sink is located at x = 1
along the x-axis (red disk). For γ = 1 (Figure 1a), we have
equal strength and droplets can take large excursions from the
source before returning to the sink. As γ increases, the trajectories emanating from the source occupy an increasingly
compacted region (Figure 1b-d). We can use this inequality
above to define a region

such that small droplets do not get further than a distance |λ |
before travelling towards the sink. The circle with radius |λ |
is shown in Figure 1 (dashed curve). Observe that, as one gets

(15)

meaning that, in order to maintain trajectories moving away
from a given test point, the sink strength needs to increase
quadratically with distance of the test point to the source.
B.

Intermediate-sized droplets in the absence of gravity

For St = O(R) and St  R, the droplet is slowed down exponentially according to

X(t)

We are interested in whether droplets move away from or
towards the sink. To this end, we look for trajectories for
which v > 0:
v=

3

v(t) ≈ v(0) exp [−(R/St)t],

(16)

which represents a balance between inertia and drag forces.
Provided γ > 1, and in the absence of gravity, in the longterm, the droplet will always migrate towards the sink. However, in the case of intermediate-sized droplets, the maximum
distance travelled by the droplet before it moves towards the
sink is given by |v(0)|/(R/St). Since the initial velocity of the
droplet is chosen to be the same as the surrounding fluid, then
we can write the maximum distance as |u(X(0), 0)|/(R/St).
As explained above (see (9)), in our non-dimensionalisation,
our characteristic velocity U 0 was chosen to be that of the outlet. Hence, in this non-dimensionalisation, |u(X(0), 0)| = 1.
Figure 2 shows the trajectories of intermediate-sized
droplets for γ = 5 in the absence of gravity. The striking feature of the plot is the shift from a regime where the maximal extent of the trajectories as predicted by (14) is no longer
valid and must be replaced with a circle of radius St/R. In
Figure 2a, St/R = 0.1, so that the droplets are slowed down
rapidly before following the fluid flow. In Figure 2b, St/R = 1,
meaning that the droplets are slowed down over the area covered by the unit circle, before being brought to the sink as ideal
tracers. Finally, in Figure 2c, St/R = 2 so that the droplets
travel a non-dimensional distance of 2 before being slowed
down enough to be pulled into the sink.
Hence, we find that, in the absence of gravity, we can have
two very different behaviours depending on whether we have
small droplets St  R or intermediate-sized droplets St ≥
√
R. Small droplets cannot get further than a distance ( γ +
1)/(γ − 1) from source before travelling towards the sink, but
intermediate-sized droplets are not restricted by this, and can
√
travel further than this provided St/R > ( γ + 1)/(γ − 1).
C.

The effect of gravity on small droplets

As droplets move from the source to the sink, gravity attempts to pull them vertically downwards. Over the timescale
of the problem: i.e., the average time it takes a droplet to travel
from source to sink, gravity may or may not have an appreciable effect. Intuitively, one would imagine that smaller droplets
are influenced more by the airflow than gravity: for stronger
sinks, the effect of gravity is comparatively less. Also, intuitively, one would expect that this holds true provided that the

(b) γ = 2, (c) γ = 5, and (d) γ = 10. In these plots, R = 0.001, Λ = 0.0001, |g| = 0. The trajectories do not change for changing R. The
dashed circle indicates the predicted maximal distance that a droplet can travel in this regime, calculated using the inequality (14). The source

source and sink are not too far away. The gravitational vector
is non-dimensionalised according to U 02 /|x00 | as shown in (7)
so it depends on the the initial speed, and the distance between
the source and sink.
For St  R < 2/3, and in the absence of gravity, there are
three fixed points: the source, sink and a saddle point located
at x = −|λ | along the x-axis (Figure 1). When gravitational
effects are included, the fixed point at x = −|λ | moves clockwise along about the origin as the effect of gravity is increased
(see Figure 3a). A fourth fixed point (saddle) is created far
from the source-sink pair, which gradually moves towards the
sink (Figure 3b,c) as the effect of gravity is increased. In
Figure. 3d, the separatrices (indicated as the red dash-dotted
curves) show that there is a wedge of trajectories that escape
the pull of the sink. As might be expected, these trajectories

are those that point directly away from the sink. Our results
show that even for small droplets, gravity can be important if
either the sink is far away or if the ejection speed is too low.
D.

The effect of gravity on intermediate-sized droplets

Small droplets are deflected by gravity, but generally feel
the pull of the sink. Whether or not they are pulled in is determined by the interaction of gravity, the angle of their trajectory, and γ. As the droplets become larger, gravitational
effects dominate, and the sink becomes ineffective. In Figure 4, we show how the droplet trajectories behave as St is
increased. Figure 4a, show the familiar situation where the
droplets are so small that gravity does not appreciably affect

their trajectory over the characteristic lengthscale.
As St is increased, Figure 4b shows that there are a range
of trajectories with ejection angles α (defined with respect to
the positive sense of the x-axis) around the source that are deflected downwards away from the sink. This is consistent with
previous sections. However, at a critical St ≈ 2.5 × 10−6 , each
trajectory is deflected downwards by gravity (Figure 4c). In
this case, the maximum horizontal distance travelled by the
droplets is very small. Interestingly, this trend is not monotonic. Further increasing St, the trajectories adopt a ballistic
trajectory (Figure 4d). Such droplets can move in very close
proximity to the sink, but are not pulled into it (Figure 4d).

One of the possible applications of this paper, is to underpin
more sophisticated analytical or numerical models to study the
transmission of respiratory viruses. In medical applications, it
is common practice to categorise the emitted fluid particles as
larger droplets from 5 µm to 1 mm in diameter that have a ballistic trajectory, and aerosol that remains airborne23 . Droplets
smaller than 5 µm and desiccated droplet nuclei are known
as aerosol, which can remain airborne for several hours24–26 .
Respiratory viruses are transmitted from virus-laden fluid particles to the recipient through (1) aerosol inhalation; or (2)
droplet deposition on the recipient’s mouth, nose or conjunctiva; or (3) droplet deposition on a surface and successive
transmission through physical contact27 . The SARS-CoV-2
virus, for example, has a diameter of 70–90 nm28 and it is
carried by droplets and aerosol26,29 .
The model proposed in this paper can provide new insights
on the aerosol transmission, i.e. through those particles whose
Stokes number is not sufficiently large to have a ballistic trajectory. The relative importance of aerosol (1) and droplet
(2 and 3) virus transmission is not always known, and it is
yet to be established for the SARS-CoV-230 . Counterintuitively, it has been argued that aerosol could be more dangerous than larger droplets31 . Smaller droplets (≤5 µm) suspended in aerosol might carry a higher concentration of virus
than larger droplets (>5 µm)30,32,33 . The largest droplets are
less likely to penetrate deeply in the respiratory system and
might be deactivated by the effective first structural and defence barrier of the mucosa34 . Conversely, aerosolised virus
half-life exceeds one hour26 and can be transported airborne
through inhalation deep into the lungs35–38 , avoiding the defences of the upper respiratory system. Furthermore, aerosol
inoculation has been shown to cause more severe symptoms
than droplets administered by intranasal inoculation and the
dose of influenza required for inoculation by the aerosol route
is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than the dose required by
intranasal inoculation2,33,38 .
To apply our model to aerosol dispersion, we consider the
particles ejected by a person talking. A person ejects about
tens of fluid particles per second with diameters between39
0.1 µm to 1 mm and with a speed of the order40 of 1 m s−1 .

trajectories will be different for different choices of R. The dashed circle indicates the predicted maximal distance that a fluid parcel can travel
when ejected from the source. The black crosses indicate the position of saddle fixed points. The source is indicated by a green filled circle
and the sink is indicated by a red filled circle.

Because this is the most frequent source of aerosol, this accounts for most of the aerosol inhaled by other people41,42 .
Coughing leads to the ejection of 100-1000 fluid particles per
second with a speed around 10 m s−1 , while sneezing generates 1000-10,000 fluid particles per second with a speed of up
to43 20 m s−1 . The values presented in this paragraph should
be taken as indicative because there is a significant variability
between different experimental studies2,33,36,38,44–55 .
Some of the physics that is not considered in this work, is
the particle-particle interaction and evaporation. In fact, fluid
particles are ejected through a jet that transports particles in
the range of 2 µm – 150 µm45,56,57 , i.e. the aerosol, while the
largest droplets have a ballistic trajectory independent of the

surrounding flow2,57,58 . The jet can be either laminar or turbulent when breathing and speaking, while coughing and sneezing always results in a turbulent jet with a diameter-based
Reynolds number higher2 than 104 . Once ejected, the air jet
extends along a straight trajectory; its diameter increases linearly with the travelled distance, while the mean velocity linearly decreases, and the turbulent statistics remain constant
(i.e. the jet is self similar59 ). Once the largest particles with a
ballistic trajectory have left the air jet, the jet bends upwards
due to the buoyancy force caused by the temperature and thus
density difference2 . Smaller size particles (≤100 µm) are
transported by the jet while they evaporate. Once a droplet
exits the jet, it falls at its settling speed. For a particle with

a diameter of 50 µm and 10 µm, the settling speed is less
than 0.06 m s−1 and 0.03 m s−1 , respectively. The smallest
of these two droplets is likely to land in the form of a desiccated nucleus. In fact, while a droplet with a diameter of
50 µm evaporates in about 6 s, a 10 µm droplet evaporates in
less than2,60 0.1 s, although their survivability also depends on
the ambient temperature and relative humidity20 . Once these
droplets leave the jet, they can still be transported by ambient
air currents, which have speeds typically in excess61 of 0.01
m s−1 . These currents are modelled by the sink-source flow
field discussed in this paper.
A key issue that is discussed in this study is the extent to
which the cloud of droplets and aerosol are displaced into
the neighbouring environment, as this is associated with virus

transmission risk. Previous studies estimated that the overall horizontal range of the droplets generated while breathing
and coughing before they land on the ground is around 1-2
m56–58 . These studies led to the CDC62 and WHO63 social
distancing guidelines. Nonetheless, the complex physics involved, which includes knowledge of the particle size distribution, their speed of evaporation, the viral charge of droplets of
different size, the diffusivity of the virus-laden particles, etc.,
makes it difficult to assess what is the effective dispersion of
virus-laden fluid particles into the environment once ejected.
It was found that the largest droplets generated by sneezing
can reach a distance as high as 8 m2,3,57 , while aerosol dispersion is highly dependent on the temperature, humidity and
air currents. For these reasons, this paper does not aim to

Predicted Droplet Dispersion

Currently, there is a large amount of disagreement in the
reported spectra of droplet sizes in respiratory events2 . The
analysis is complicated by various factors including the evaporation of the droplets as they travel from the source, which in
turn, is influenced by ambient humidity and temperature. Recent mathematical modelling of droplet emission during talking have categorised droplets into one of three groups64 : small
(< 75µm), intermediate (75-400µm) and large (> 400µm).
Small droplets approximately follow the air and can travel a
great distance by weakly feeling the effects of gravity. Large
droplets can also travel a large distance due to their inertia.
However, the intermediate-sized droplets feel strongly both
gravity and drag, and their trajectory is a complex interaction
of these effects. Similar trends were observed in computational fluid dynamics simulations of previous authors65 .
In this section, we examine the problem from a much simplified perspective: we ignore evaporation entirely. We model
the situation as a point source emitting droplets of various
sizes in the presence of gravitational forces, and compute the
maximum horizontal distance travelled by these droplets. In
this case, Q02 = 0 L min−1 , and other quantities such as jet
speed, direction and spread are taken from recent experimental studies of the authors66 : these quantities are summarised
in Table I.
We find that for both heavy and quiet breathing, the maximum distance travelled by droplets L0 (and the corresponding flight time τ 0 ) depends strongly on the droplet diameter
– see Figure 5. As expected, small droplets can travel many
metres, however, we see that there is an intermediate range
of droplet diameters where the horizontal distance is minimised. For quiet breathing, this minimum occurs between
69µm < d < 77µm, while for heavy breathing this minimum
occurs between 50µm < d < 55µm. This multi-modal behaviour is reminiscent of that in previous experimental stud-

8

ies that measured the size distributions of droplets in various respiratory events such as talking and coughing54,55 and
sneezing43 . The multi-modal behaviour observed in experiments is attributed to the different generation modes: bronchiolar, laryngeal and oral. In our simplified model, we do not
have any assumption on the biological origin of the droplet:
the existence of the minimum is a characteristic of the droplets
themselves and cannot be used as an indicator of the underlying droplet size distribution. The time it takes τ 0 decreases
monotonically with increasing droplet diameter as shown in
Figure 5b-c.
In order to unpick the physics, observe that the drag force
scales with the diameter of the droplet, but the weight of
the droplet scales with the diameter cubed, hence for large
droplets, the drag force is negligible in comparison with the
inertia of the droplet. As shown before, the droplets are
slowed down exponentially in the horizontal direction and
are accelerated in the vertical direction by gravity, giving the
maximum horizontal range of the droplet (when nominally

meaning that the trajectories are ballistic, and we expect that
for St  R, the maximum distance becomes independent of
St, in agreement with the observation that large droplets’ trajectories are independent of the surrounding flow2,57,58 .
For small droplets St  R, the drag decreases linearly with
decreasing droplet diameter, but the weight rapidly decreases
cubically with decreasing diameter. Hence small droplets follow the airflow faithfully with little influence from gravity.
Such droplets can get great distances before falling, as shown
in the left-hand side of Figure 5.
In the case of small droplets, the horizontal component of
the droplet’s trajectory follows the airflow like a tracer, and
the droplet falls at its Stokesian settling velocity. Upon inspection, we find that the maximum horizontal distance L
(when nominally Y = −1) tends to the following asymptote
as St → 0.

In between these two extreme cases, the drag force on the
droplet is the same order of magnitude as the gravitational
force. By balancing these two effects, we can approximate
the upper bound of St where the droplets become ballistic:

= 1000 kg m−3 . In human respiration39,45 , the
exhaled droplets have diameters d 0 = 2a0 in the range 0.5 µm
to 2000 µm. For a human breathing at rest, their average
volume flux is in the range Q01 = 5-8 L min−1 : these values
of flow rate are similar to those in previous studies68 , which
reports 13 litre/min for breathing, and the typical speed of
a jet in normal breathing conditions is of the order of U 0 =
1 m s−1 . In violent respiratory events, such as sneezing or
coughing, these values could be significantly higher2 . Finally,
the extraction unit is located a distance of |x00 | = 0.2 m from
the person. These quantities are summarised in Table II.
Based on these numbers, the non-dimensional parameters
that govern the trajectory of the droplet are determined to be
R = 0.00115, Re = 12, 225, Λ = 0.00022, |g| = 1.96, and the
Stokes number ranges approximately from 10−9 to 10−1 . The
parameter γ relates the flux of the extraction unit to the flux
of a human’s breath, and its effect will be examined. In particular, if we suppose that the envisaged extraction unit has
a volume flux approximately equal to that of a standard vacuum cleaner (2832 L min−1 ), then we can approximate that
γ ≈ 436. In Figure 7, we show the efficacy of such extraction for a range of St. Extraction is very effective at low
St, however for St > 8.5 × 10−5 , such extraction is ineffective. This upper bound of the Stokes number corresponds to
water droplets of diameter 71 µm. Droplets larger than this
will not be collected by extraction. In the nomenclature of
Section IV B, the effective range of extraction corresponds to
non-ballistic droplets.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have presented a simplified mathematical
model for droplet dispersion from a source and in the presence
an aerosol extractor. In the absence of gravity, and for St  R,
droplets behave as ideal tracers and the maximum distance

10

that they can travel before being extracted is a function of γ
only. In this case, there are two (source, and sink if γ = 1)
or three (source, sink, and saddle if γ > 1) fixed points. The
fixed points in this study are co-linear, and the position of the
saddle depends on γ alone, for any given distance between
source and sink. For moderate St, the droplets’ inertia carry
them far away from the source until they are slowed down by
drag forces and pulled into the sink. In this case, the maximum
distance that droplets can travel is given by R/St.
When gravity effects are taken into account, the saddle
point for St  R is no longer co-linear but moves on an arc,
clockwise about the source, and a fourth fixed point (saddle)
emerges approximately below the sink fixed point. For fixed
γ, this fixed point moves closer to the source as the magnitude
of gravity is increased. In this case, there is a set of trajectories
that are pulled away from the sink by gravity. For moderate
St, gravity plays an increasingly important role, and there is
a critical value of gravity that pulls all trajectories vertically
downwards away from the source. For yet larger St, the trajectories adopt a ballistic trajectory, with even those that travel
close to the sink not being pulled in.
COVID-19 has brought increased awareness of the risks
of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) across all fields of
medicine, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of
droplet dispersion and categorisation during respiration and
AGPs. Clinicians recognise that our historical approaches to
protection during AGPs are no longer adequate and that many
additional precautions are necessary. In order to develop the
most effective solutions, a critical first step is understanding
the behaviour of droplets generated during AGPs. This paper,
allows us to predict this behaviour and inform our understanding of “at risk” zones in the vicinity of an AGP. In particular,
we performed simulations relevant to human respiration, as
well as simulations to inform the development of an aerosol
extractor for use in clinical settings. These simulations can
help to guide recommendations on maximum safe distances
between source and sink.
Additionally, these models provide a better understanding
of the behaviour of individual droplets of various sizes, that
may be present in a wide range of aerosols contaminated with
viruses or other pathogens. This may help clinicians to make
better informed decisions regarding safety while performing
AGPs; and in their choices of the type of PPE they wear.
Lastly, these models provide a basis upon which aerosol and
droplet contamination from a wide range of surgical, medical, dental and veterinary AGPs can be modelled, while taking into account airflows in confined clinical spaces. In this
case, we found that for St ≤ 8.5 × 10−5 , all of the aerosol is
extracted and that gravity has minimal effect, this St corresponds to droplets with approximate diameter equal to 0.07
mm. Droplets larger than this are affected by gravity, and for
St = 10−2 , corresponding to droplets equal to 0.78 mm, none
of the droplets are extracted. Such large droplets would be
typically captured by of personal protective equipment (PPE),
such as FFP1 masks, which have pore sizes typically smaller
than 1 µm.
We determined the maximum range of droplets ejected
from the source in the absence of a sink, and found that the

range is minimised for intermediate-sized droplets. We find
that in human respiration, this pertains to droplets within the
observed range of ejected droplets. This could have implications for the interpretation for data coming from experiments
on biological subjects. In particular, those that attribute observed bi- and tri-modal droplet dispersion to biological functions. Our studies suggest that the bi-modal nature of the
curve is a function of the droplet’s Stokes number and not
necessarily linked to a specific biological function.
In our model, we neglected the Basset history term in the
Maxey-Riley equation. These Basset history term is of significant importance for bubbly flows, where it can account for
a quarter of the instantaneous force on a bubble14 . Generally
speaking, for R  2/3, this term can be safely ignored for
small and intermediate-sized droplets. Recent studies have
also shown that neglecting it in modelling of raindrop growth
leads to a substantial overestimate of the growth rate of the
droplet. Hence, for the solutions that become ballistic, we expect that such trajectories would be influenced by the Basset
history term, and should be included. To do this efficiently,
there is a very promising method developed recently15 . Since
this is not the focus of our study (such droplets can be captured by other forms of PPE), we do not perform such a study
here.
If the aerosol route of transmission is confirmed to be important by the World Health Organization20,69 , we will need
to reconsider guidelines on social distancing, ventilation systems, shared spaces, etc. To ensure that we put in place the
correct mitigating measures such as, for example, face coverings, we need to have a better understanding of the different
droplet behaviours and their different dispersion mechanisms
depending on their size. This paper contributes to this debate
by providing a new framework for categorising droplets depending on their dispersion mechanism.
