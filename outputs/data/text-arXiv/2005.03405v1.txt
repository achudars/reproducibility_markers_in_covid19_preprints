Abstract
With the rapidly worldwide spread of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it is of
great importance to conduct early diagnosis of COVID-19 and predict the time
that patients might convert to the severe stage, for designing effective treatment
plan and reducing the clinicians’ workloads. In this study, we propose a joint classification and regression method to determine whether the patient would develop
severe symptoms in the later time, and if yes, predict the possible conversion time
that the patient would spend to convert to the severe stage. To do this, the proposed
method takes into account 1) the weight for each sample to reduce the outliers’ influence and explore the problem of imbalance classification, and 2) the weight for
each feature via a sparsity regularization term to remove the redundant features of
high-dimensional data and learn the shared information across the classification
task and the regression task. To our knowledge, this study is the first work to predict the disease progression and the conversion time, which could help clinicians
to deal with the potential severe cases in time or even save the patients’ lives.
Experimental analysis was conducted on a real data set from two hospitals with

422 chest computed tomography (CT) scans, where 52 cases were converted to
severe on average 5.64 days and 34 cases were severe at admission. Results show
that our method achieves the best classification (e.g., 85.91% of accuracy) and regression (e.g., 0.462 of the correlation coefficient) performance, compared to all
comparison methods. Moreover, our proposed method yields 76.97% of accuracy
for predicting the severe cases, 0.524 of the correlation coefficient, and 0.55 days
difference for the converted time.

1. Introduction
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severeacute respiratory symptom Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2), and has resulted in more
than 1.3 million confirmed cases and about 75k deaths worldwide as of April 7,
2020 JHU (2020). Due to its rapid spread, infection cases are increasing with high
fatality rate (e.g., up to 5.7%). Statistical models and machine learning methods
have been developing to analyze the transmission dynamics and conduct early
diagnosis of COVID-19 del Rio and Malani (2020); Li et al. (2020b). For example, Wu et al. employed the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model
to estimate the number of the COVID-19 cases in Wuhan based on the number
of exported COVID-19 cases which moved from Wuhan to other cities in China
Wu et al. (2020).
The increasing number of confirmed COVID-19 cases results in the lack of the
clinicians and the increase of the clinicians’ workloads. Many laboratory techniques have been used to confirm the suspected COVID-19 cases by clinicians
Jung et al. (2020), including real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Corman et al. (2020); Ai et al. (2020), non-PCR tests (e.g., isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology Craw and Balachandran (2012)), noncontrast chest computed tomography (CT) and radiographs Lee et al. (2020), and
so on. It is well known that manually detection is time-consuming and increases
the infection risk of the clinicians Kong and Agarwal (2020). Moreover, laboratory tests are usually prohibited for all suspected cases due to the limitation of
the test kits Kong and Agarwal (2020); Ng et al. (2020). Also, RT-PCR has been
widely used to confirm COVID-19, but easily results in low sensitivity Chaganti et al.
(2020). As a good alternative, artificial intelligence techniques on available data
from laboratory tests have been playing important roles on the confirmation and
2

follow-up of COVID-19 cases. For example, Alom et al. employed the inception
residual recurrent convolutional neural network (CNN) and transfer learning on
X-ray and CT scan images to detect COVID-19 and segment the infected regions
of COVID-19 Alom et al. (2020). Ozkaya et al. first applied CNN to fuse and rank
deep features for the early detection of COVID-19, and then used support vector
machine (SVM) to conduct binary classification using the obtained deep features
Ozkaya et al. (2020).
While imaging data is playing an important role in the diagnosis of all kinds of
pneumonia diseases including COVID-19 Shi et al. (2020a), CT has been applied
to help monitor imaging changes and measure the disease severity Zhao et al.
(2020); Chaganti et al. (2020). For example, Chaganti et al. designed an automated system to quantify the abnormal tomographic patterns appeared in COVID19 Chaganti et al. (2020). Li et al. employed CNNs with the imaging features of
radiographs and CT images for identifying COVID-19 Li et al. (2020a).
In this work, we investigate a new early diagnosis method to predict whether
the mild confirmed cases (i.e., non-severe cases) of COVID-19 would develop
severe symptoms in later time and estimate the time interval. However, it is challenging due to many issues, such as small infected lesions in the chest CT scan
at the early stage, appearances similar to other pneumonia, the data set with highdimensional features and small-sized samples, and imbalanced group distribution.
First, the infected lesions in the chest CT scan at the early stage are usually
small and their appearances are quite similar with that of other pneumonia. Given
the early stage of COVID-19 with minor imaging signs, it is difficult to predict its
future progression status. Conventional severity assessment methods can easily
distinguish a severe sign of the image from the mild sign, since the changes of
CT data are correlated with disease severity, e.g., the lung involvement and abnormalities increase while the symptoms become severe. However, the infected
volume of the non-severe COVID-19 cases is usually mild. For example, Guan et
al. showed that 84.4% of non-severe patients had mild symptoms and more than
95% severe cases had severe symptoms on CT changes Guan et al. (2020). On the
other hand, the clinicians have few prior knowledge about whether or when the
non-severe cases convert to severe cases, so early diagnosis and conversion time
prediction could reduce the clinicians’ workloads or even save patients’ levies.
Second, the collected data set usually has a small number of samples (i.e., smallsized samples) and high-dimensional features. Due to all kinds of reasons, such as
data protection, data security, and the scenario of acute infectious diseases, a small
number of subjects are available for early diagnosis of COVID-19. The limited
samples are difficult to build an effective artificial intelligence model. Moreover,
3

high-dimensional features for each imaging data are often extracted, by considering to capture the comprehensive changes of the disease. Hence, both of scenarios
often result in the issue of over-fitting and the issue of curse of dimensionality
Hu et al. (2019); Zhu et al. (2014).
Third, the class or group distribution of the data set is generally imbalanced.
In particular, the number of severe cases is much smaller than the number of nonsevere cases, e.g., 20% reported1 . Such a scenario poses a challenge for most of
classification methods because they were designed under the assumption of an
equal number of samples for each class Adeli et al. (2019). As a result, previous
classification techniques output poor predictive performance, especially for the
minority class Adeli et al. (2019); Zhu et al. (2019c).
In this work, we propose a novel joint regression and classification method
to identify the severe COVID-19 cases from the non-severe cases and predict the
conversion time from a non-severe case to the severe case in a unified framework. Specifically, we employ the logistic regression for the binary classification
task and the linear regression for the regression task. Moreover, we employ an
ℓ2,1 -norm regularization term on both the classification coefficient matrix and the
regression coefficient matrix to consider the correlation between the two tasks as
well as select the useful features for disease diagnosis and conversion time prediction. We further design a novel method to learn the weights of the samples,
i.e., automatically learning the weight of each sample so that the important samples have large weights and the unimportant samples have small or even zero
weights. Moreover, the samples with zero weights in both the majority class and
the minority class are excluded to the process of the construction of the joint
classification and regression, thus the problem of imbalance classification can be
solved.
Different from previous literature, the contribution of our proposed method is
listed as follows.
First, our method considers imbalance classification, feature selection, and
sample weight in the same framework. Moreover, our method takes into account
the correlation between the classification task and the regression task. In the literature, few study has focused on exploring the above issues simultaneously. For
example, the studies separately conduct feature selection Zhu et al. (2014) and

sample weight Hu et al. (2019); Zhu et al. (2019b) and Zhu et al. conduct joint
classification and regression Zhu et al. (2014). Recently, a few studies simultaneously conduct feature selection and sample selection Adeli et al. (2019, 2018);
Hu et al. (2019).
Second, in the literature, a few machine learning methods have proposed to
conduct the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. For example, Tang et al. employed
random forest to detect the severe cases from the confirmed cases based on the CT
scan data Tang et al. (2020). Shi et al. conducted the same task by a two-step strategy, i.e., automatically categorizing all subjects into groups followed by random
forests in each group for classification Shi et al. (2020a). However, previous literature did not take into account any of the above issues. Recently, deep learning
techniques Alom et al. (2020); Ozkaya et al. (2020); Li et al. (2020a) have been
employed to conduct early diagnosis of COVID-19, lacking the interpretability.
To our knowledge, this is the first study simultaneously detecting the severe cases
and predicting the conversion time, which have widely applications because the
severe cases could endanger patients’ lives and correctly predicting of the conversion time makes the clinicians take care the patients early or even save the
patients’ lives.
2. Materials and image preprocessing
This study investigated the chest CT images of 422 confirmed COVID-19 patients. The demographic information is summarized in Table 1. If a patient has
multiple scans over time, the first scan is used. All CT images was provided by
Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Sicuan University West China Hospital. Informed consents were waived and all private information of patients was
anonymized. Moreover, the ethics of committees of these two institutes approved
the protocol of this study.
All patients were confirmed by the national centers for disease control (CDC)
based on the positive new Coronavirus nucleic acid antibody. Moreover, patients
with large motion artifacts or pre-existing lung cancer conditions on the CT scans
5

Figure 1: The visualization of the segments of a chest CT scan image, i.e., 5 lung lobes (left) and
18 pulmonary segments.

were excluded from this study.
2.1. Image acquisition parameters
All patients underwent thin-section CT scan by the scanners including SCENARIA 64 from Hitachi, Brilliance 64 from Philips, uCT 528 from United Imaging. The CT protocol is listed as follows: kV: 120, slice thickness: 1-1.5 mm, and
breath hold at full inspiration. More details about both the image acquisition and
the image pre-processing can be found in Shan et al. (2020); Shi et al. (2020a).
Moreover, we used the mediastinal window (with window width 350 hounsfield
unit (HU) and window level 40 HU) and the lung window (with window width
1200 HU and window level-600 HU) for reading analysis.
2.2. Image pre-processing
We utilized the disease characteristics, i.e., infection locations and spreading
patterns, to extract handcrafted features of each COVID-19 chest CT image. To do
this, we used the COVID-19 chest CT analysis tool developed by Shanghai United
Imaging Intelligence Co. Ltd., and followed the literature Shan et al. (2020) to
calculate the quantitative features.
First, the COVID-19 chest CT analysis tool designed a deep learning method
named VB-net to automatically segment infected lung regions and lung fields
bilaterally. The infected lung regions were mainly related to manifestations of
pneumonia, such as mosaic sign, ground glass opacification (GGO), lesion-related
signs, and interlobular septal thickening.
Second, after the segmentation process, the lung fields include the left lung
and the right lung, 5 lung lobes, and 18 pulmonary segments, as shown in Figure
1. Specifically, the left lung included superior lobe and inferior lobe, while the
right lung included superior lobe, middle lobe, and inferior lobe. Moreover, the
6

left lung has 8 pulmonary segments and the right lung has 10 pulmonary segments.
As a result, we had 26 regions of interest (ROIs) for each CT images.
Third, we partitioned each segment to five parts based on the HU ranges,
i.e., HU[−∞,−700] , HU[−700,−500] , HU[−500,−200] , HU[−200,50] , and HU[50,∞] . Specifically, HU[−∞,−700] indicates the parts with the HU range between −∞ and 700, HU[−700,−500] indicates the parts with the HU range between -700 and 500, HU[−500,−200] indicates the parts with the HU range between -500 and 200, HU[−200,50] indicates the parts with the HU range between -200 and 50, and
HU[50,∞] indicates the parts with the HU range between 50 and ∞. As a result,
each CT image was partitioned to 130 parts (i.e., 390 = 26 ∗ 5).
In this study, we extracted three kinds of handcrafted features from each part,
i.e., density feature, volume feature, and mass feature. Specifically, we obtained
the volume feature as the total volume of infected region and the density feature by
calculating the averaged HU value within the infected region. We further followed
Song et al. (2014) to define the mass feature to simultaneously reflect the volume
and density of subsolid nodule because the mass feature has demonstrated to have
potentially superior reproducibility to 3D volumetry, i.e., Mass = (Density +
1000) × V olume × 0.001.
Finally, each CT image is represented by 390D handcrafted features in this
study.
3. Method
In this paper, we denote matrices, vectors, and scalars, respectively, as boldface uppercase letters, boldface lowercase letters, and normal italic letters. Specifically, we denote a matrix as X = [x1 , ..., xn ]. The i-th row and j-th column of
X are denoted as xi and xj , respectively. We further denote theq
Frobenius norm
pP
P

i 2
and the ℓ2,1 -norm of a matrix X as kXkF =
j kxj k2 and
i kx k2 =
q
P
P P 2
kXk2,1 = i kxi k2 = i
j xij , respectively. We also denote the transpose

operator, the trace operator, and the inverse of a matrix X as XT , tr(X), and X−1 ,
respectively.

3.1. Sparse logistic regression
In the classification problem, given the feature matrix X ∈ Rd×n including n
samples xi ∈ Rd (i = 1, ..., n) and their corresponding labels yi ∈ {−1, +1}, the
logistic regression is employed to distinguish the severe cases (i.e., yi = +1) from

7

the confirmed COVID-19 cases (i.e., yi = −1). Specifically, by denoting w ∈ Rd
as the coefficient vector, the logistic loss function is defined as
min
w

n
X

log(1 + exp(−yi (wT xi ))) + λkwk22

(1)

i=1

where λ1 is a tuning parameter, and the ℓ2 -norm regularization term on the coefficient vector w is used to control the complexity of the logistic regression. Eq.
(1) conducts the classification task without taking into account the issues, such as
feature selection, sample weight, and imbalance classification.
First, in real applications, clinicians have prior knowledge on the regions of
the CT scan data which are possible related to the disease, but we cannot only
extract the features from these regions because they may cooperate with other regions to influence the disease. As a result, we extract the features from all imaging
data to obtain high-dimensional data, which captures the comprehensive changes
of confirmed COVID-19 cases but increases the store and computation costs as
well as easily results in the issue of curse of dimensionality Zhu et al. (2019c). To
address this issue, we design machine learning models to automatically recognize
the features related to the disease by taking into account the correlation of the fea2
tures. Specifically, we replace the ℓ2 -norm on the coefficient vector w (i.e.,
Pd kwk2)
by the ℓ1 -norm on on the coefficient vector w (i.e., kwk1 and kwk1 = i=1 |wi |),
which outputs sparse elements to make the corresponding features (i.e., the rows
in X) not involving the classification task, i.e.,
min
w

n
X
i=1

log(1 + exp(−yi (wT xi ))) + λ2 kwk1

(2)

where λ2 is a tuning parameter.
3.2. Balanced and sparse logistic regression
In binary classification, the issue of imbalance classification easily results in
the classification results bias to the majority class, i.e., outputting high false negatives. In the literature, both re-sampling methods and cost-sensitive learning
methods Zhu et al. (2019b) have been used for solve the issue of imbalance classification.
Recently, robust loss functions has been widely designed to reduce the influences of outliers by taking into account the sample weight in robust statistics Zhu et al. (2019c). Specifically, robust loss functions use a weight vector
8

α ∈ R1×n to automatically output small weights to the samples with large estimation errors and large weights to the samples with small estimation error. As
consequence, the samples with large estimation errors are regarded as outliers and
their influences are reduced. In the literature, a number of robust loss functions
have been developed, including ℓ1 − ℓ2 function, Cauchy function, and GemanMcClure estimator, etc. Hu et al. (2019); Zhu et al. (2019a). However, the robust
loss function was not designed to explore the issue of imbalance classification.
In this paper, motivated by the self-paced learning assigning weights to the
samples, we propose a new method to assign a weight to each sample as well as to
solve the problem of imbalance classification. By regarding that different samples
have different contributions to the construction of the classification model, our
method expect to assign large weights to the important samples and small weights
to the unimportant samples. Moreover, by regarding of the problem of imbalance
classification, our method expect to set different numbers of zero weights to different classes so that there is a balance of the sample number between the positive
class and the negative class. To do this, we employ an ℓ0 -norm constraint on the
weight vector α to have the following loss function:
min
α,w

n
P

i=1

αi log(1 + exp(−yi (wT xi ))) + λ2 kwk1

(3)

s.t., kα−1 k0 = k− and kα+1 k0 = k+
where α−1 indicates the weight set of all negative samples and α+1 indicates the
weight set of all positive samples. The constraint ‘kα−1 k0 = k− ’ indicates that
the number of non-zero elements in the negative class is k− . Specifically, after
receiving the estimation value for each sample, i.e., log(1 + exp(−(yi wT xi ))),
we first sort the estimation values of all samples in the same class with an increase
order. We then keep the original weights to the weights of the k− negative samples with the smallest estimation values and 0 to the weights of the left negative
samples. In this way, either the negative samples or the positive samples with zero
weights will not involve the process of the classification model.
Our method in Eq. (3) has at least two advantages, i.e., automatically selecting
important samples (i.e., reducing the influence of the outliers) to learn the classification model and adjusting the number of selected samples for each class by
tuning the values of k− and k+ (e.g., k− = k+ ) to solve the imbalance classification problem. In particular, our method in Eq. (3) employs the ℓ0 -norm constraint
for each class to output exactly predefined non-zero elements. On the contrary,
self-paced learning uses the ℓ1 -norm constraint for all samples or other robust loss
9

functions Zhu et al. (2019c); Hu et al. (2019) to estimate the sample weight without guaranteeing the exact number of non-zero elements. As a result, compared
to self-paced learning only considering the sample weight to reduce the influence
of outliers, our method takes into account the sample weight to remove outliers
not to involve the process of the model construction as well as the problem of
imbalance classification.
3.3. Joint logistic regression and linear regression
Besides distinguishing the severe cases from the non-severe cases, predicting
the time converting a non-severe case to a severe case is also important because
it may be related to the patients’ lives. To do this, a naive solution is to separately conduct a classification task to diagnose the severe cases and a regression
task to predict the conversion time. Obviously, the separate strategy ignores the
correlation among two tasks. In this paper, by regarding the prediction of conversion time as a regression task, we define a ridge regression to linearly characterize
the correlation between the feature matrix X and the vector of conversion time
z ∈ R1×n by
min kvT X − zk22 + λ3 kvk22
v

(4)

where v ∈ Rd is the coefficient vector for the regression task and λ3 is a tuning
parameter.
Similar to the classification task in Eq. (3), the regression task in Eq. (4) still
needs to consider the issues, such as feature selection, sample weight, and imbalance classification. Moreover, in this study, we conduct joint classification and
regression (i.e., multi-task learning) by simultaneously considering a classification task and a regression task in the same framework. We expect that each task
could obtain information from another task so that the model effectiveness of each
of them can be improved by the shared information. Specifically, we employ the
ℓ2,1 -norm regularization term with respect to both the variable w and the variable
v to obtain the following objective function:
min

n
P

α,w,v,β i=1

αi log(1 + exp(−yi (wT xi )))

s.t., kα−1 k0 = k− and kα+1 k0 = k+ ,
kβ−1 k0 = k− and kβ+1 k0 = k+

(5)

where β ∈ R1×n is the sample weight vector for the regression task and [w, v] ∈
Rd×2 . γ and λ are tuning parameters. k[w, v]k2,1 indicates that the selected
10

features are obtained by the classification and regression model. Moreover, the
selected features are their shared or common information benefiting each of them
Evgeniou and Pontil (2004).
Eq. (5) needs a tuning parameter γ to have a magnitude or importance tradeoff for two tasks. However, the process of tuning parameter is time-consuming
and needs prior knowledge. In this work, we use a squared root operator on the
second term of Eq. (5) to automatically obtain their weights. It is noteworthy
that we keep the parameter λ to be tuned because it controls the sparsity of the
term k[w, v]k2,1 and the sparsity will be changed based on the data distribution
Evgeniou and Pontil (2004); Zhu et al. (2017). Hence, the final objective function
of our proposed joint classification and regression method is:

kβ−1k0 = k− and kβ+1k0 = k+

To solve the optimization problem in Eq. (6), i.e., optimizing the variables v
and β, we compute the derivatives of the square root in Eq. (6) and obtain the
following formulation

The values of γ in Eq. (7b) is automatically obtained without the tuning process and can be regarded as the weight of the tasks. Specifically, if the prediction
error is small, the value of γ is large, i.e., the regression task is more important
than the classification task. Hence, the optimization of the value of γ automatically balances the contributions of two tasks. As a result, the optimization of Eq.
(6) is changed to optimize Eq. (7b).

3.5. Convergence analysis
Algorithm 1 involves five variables (i.e., w, α, v, β, and γ). By denoting
wt , αt , vt , β t , and γ t , respectively, as the t-th iteration results of w, α, v, β,
and γ, we denote the objective function value of the t-th iteration of Eq. (6) as
J(wt , αt , vt , β t , γ t ).
By fixing αt , vt , β t , and γ t , we employ the Newton’s method to optimize w,
so we have
J(wt+1 , αt , vt , β t , γ t ) ≤ J(wt , αt , vt , β t , γ t )

(18)

J(wt+1 , αt+1 , vt , β t , γ t ) ≤ J(wt+1 , αt , vt , β t , γ t )

(19)

J(wt+1 , αt+1 , vt+1 , β t , γ t ) ≤ J(wt+1 , αt+1 , vt , β t , γ t )

(20)

J(wt+1 , αt+1 , vt+1 , β t+1 , γ t ) ≤ J(wt+1 , αt+1 , vt+1 , β t , γ t )

(21)

J(wt+1 , αt+1 , vt+1 , β t+1 , γ t+1 ) ≤ J(wt+1 , αt+1 , vt+1 , β t+1 , γ t )

(22)

J(wt+1 , αt+1 , vt+1 , β t+1 , γ t+1 ) ≤ J(wt , αt , vt , β t , γ t )

(23)

The optimizations of the variables (i.e., α, v, β, and γ) have closed-form
solutions, so we have

By integrating Eqs. (18)-(22), we obtain

According to Eq. (23), the objective function values in Eq. (6) gradually
decrease with the increase of iterations until Algorithm 1 converges. Hence, the
convergence proof of Algorithm 1 to optimize Eq. (6) is completed.

4. Experiments
We experimentally evaluated our method, compared to state-of-the-art classification and regression methods, on a real COVID-19 data set with chest CT scan
data, in terms of binary classification performance and regression performance.
4.1. Experimental setting
We selected SVM and ridge regression, respectively, as the baseline methods
for the classification task and the regression task. Other comparison methods include ℓ1 -SVM (L1SVM) Chang and Lin (2011), random forest Liaw et al. (2002),
sample-feature selection (SFS) Adeli et al. (2019), ℓ1 -SVR Chang and Lin (2011)
(L1SVR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) Tibshirani (1996),
and matrix-similarity feature selection (MSFS) Zhu et al. (2014). We summarize
the details of all comparison methods in Table 2. It is noteworthy that random
forest can be used for feature selection, sample selection, and imbalance classification. However, in this study, we only used random forest to consider the
problem of imbalance classification.
In our experiments, we repeated the 5-fold cross-validation scheme 20 times
for all methods to report the average results as the final results. In the model
selection, we set λ ∈ {10−3, 10−2 , ..., 103 } in Eq. (6), and fixed k = 50 for
solving the problem of imbalance classification for our method. We followed the
literature Chang and Lin (2011); Liaw et al. (2002); Adeli et al. (2019); Tibshirani
(1996); Zhu et al. (2014) to set the parameters of the comparison methods so that
they outputted the best results.

We report the classification performance of all methods in Figure 2. We also
report the classification performance of our proposed method using single-task
learning and multi-task learning in Table 3 and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves of all methods in Figure 2. Based on the results, we conclude
our observations as follows.
First, it could be observed that the proposed method achieves the best classification performance, followed by SFS, MSFS, random forest, L1SVM, and SVM.
Specifically, our proposed method improve on average by 32.80% and 11.13%,
respectively, compared to the worst comparison method (i.e., SVM) and the best
comparison methods (i.e., SFS), in terms of all four evaluation metrics. The reason
is the facts that our method takes into account the issues in the same framework,
such as feature selection removing the redundant features, sample weight reducing

the influence of the outliers and solving the problem of imbalance classification to
reduce the issue of high false negatives, and joint classification and regression utilizing the share information between two tasks to improve the model effectiveness
of each of them.
Second, it is important to conduct feature selection for analyzing high-dimensional
data. High-dimensional data easily results in the issue of curse of dimensionality. In the literature, many studies showed that the classification model on the
high-dimensional data will output low performance Zhu et al. (2014); Adeli et al.
(2018). Figure 2 verified the above statement. In our experiments, only SVM
does not consider the issue of high-dimensional data and achieves the worst classification performance. More specifically, the best comparison method (i.e., SFS)
improves by 21.09% and the worst comparison method (i.e., L1SVM) improve by
4.73%, for all evaluation metrics, compared to the baseline SVM.
Third, it is useful to use joint classification and regression framework for
detecting the severe cases from mild confirmation cases. As shown in Table 3
and Figure 2, our proposed method conducting joint regression and classification
achieves better classification performance, compared to the single-task based classification methods, e.g., random forest, L1SVM, SFS, and SVM. Moreover, both
MSFS and our method are joint models. However, our method outperforms MSFS
since our proposed method takes into account one more constraint, i.e., imbalance
classification. In particular, we conducted single-task classification using Eq. (3),
i.e., our proposed method without considering the regression task, Proposed w/o
Regression in Table 3. As a result, Proposed w/o Regression outperforms SFS
since both of them take into account three following constraints, such as feature
selection, sample weight, and imbalance classification.
4.3. Regression results
We evaluated the regression performance through the prediction of conversion time from the non-severe case to the severe case. We report the results of
correlation coefficients (CCs) and RMSEs of all methods in Table 4.

First, the regression performance of the methods without feature selection
(e.g., ridge regression) is worse than methods with feature selection, e.g., Lasso,
L1SVR, MSFS, and ours. Moreover, our method outperforms all comparison
methods. For example, our method receives the best performance for correlation
coefficient (e.g., 0.462) and RMSE (e.g., 7.351).
Second, similar to the results of the classification task, the results of the regression task show the advantages of the considerations, such as feature selection,
sample weight, imbalance classification, and joint classification and regression.
In particular, our proposed method considering all four considerations improves
0.054 and 1.940, respectively, in terms of correlation coefficient and RMSE, compared to MSFS which takes two considerations into account, such as feature selection, and joint classification and regression.
5. Discussion
5.1. Imbalance classification
In the classification task, our method investigates the issues, i.e., feature selection, sample weight, imbalance classification, and joint classification and regression. As a result, our method outperforms all comparison methods only focusing
on part of four issues. Moreover, our solution for each issue is shown reasonable
and feasible. An interesting question is which issue dominates the COVID-19
analysis with chest CT scan data. There is not theoretical answer. However, based
on our experimental results, the problem of imbalance classification should be the
first issue to be considered due to the following reasons.
First, it is necessary to take into account the problem of imbalance classification. In our experiments, random forest outperforms L1SVM (e.g., 6.84% for
all evaluation metrics) because random forest considers the problem of imbalance
classification and L1SVM takes into account the issue of high-dimensional data.
Moreover, the only difference between SFS and MSFS is that SFS considers the
problem of imbalance classification and MSFS conducts a joint classification and

regression. As a result, SFS beats MSFS a little bit, i.e., 1.26% improvement in
terms of all evaluation metrics.
Second, in Figure 2, the sensitivities of the methods (e.g., SVM, L1SVM, and
MSFS) are low, e.g., 23.86%, 26.73%, and 47.45% respectively. The reason is
that their classifiers could directly predict the samples of the minority class with
the label of the majority class to output high accuracy, e.g., 67.35%, 75.26%, and
86.31%, respectively. On the contrary, the methods (e.g., random forest, SFS, and
our Proposed w/o Regression) consider the issue of imbalance classification to
output the high sensitivities, e.g., 49.61%, 50.65%, and 70.73%, respectively.
5.2. Top selected regions
In this paper, we did not employ deep learning methods due to the interpretability and the issue of small-sized sample. In this section, we list top selected
features (i.e., the chest regions) in Table 5, which could help the clinicians to improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of the disease diagnosis. To do this, we
first obtained the totally selected number for each feature across 100 experiments,
i.e., repeating the 5-fold cross validation scheme 20 times, and then reported top

22 selected features (i.e., regions), each of which was selected at least 90 out of
100 times. We list our observations as follows.
First, most of selected features (i.e., 17 out of 22) are in the HU range of
[−700, −200], corresponding to the regions of ground glass opacity which has
been demonstrated related to the severity of COVID-19 Tang et al. (2020). Second, the region number in the right lung is larger than the number in the left lung,
i.e., 16 vs. 6. The possible reason is that the virus might easily infect the regions
in the right lung Shi et al. (2020b). Third, we extracted 3 kinds of handcrafted
features, i.e., density, mass, and volume, from each part. Moreover, the mass feature is related to both the density feature and the volume feature. Based on the
results, our method selected 4 and 7 density features, respectively, from the left
lung and the right lung, and 2 and 6 mass features, respectively, from the left lung
and the right lung. However, our method only selected 3 volume feature from the
right lung. Hence, we would have the conclusion that the density feature is the
20

most important in our experiments, followed by the mass feature and the volume
feature.
5.3. Importance of prediction and time estimation of severe cases
To our knowledge, this study is the first work to simultaneously predict and
estimate the conversion time of COVID-19 developing to severe symptoms using
chest CT scan data.
First, our method obtains higher sensitivity, i.e., 76.97%, compared to Tang et al.
(2020), i.e., 74.5% of sensitivity. That is, our method achieves higher accuracy for
classifying the severe cases than Tang et al. (2020). The reason could contribute
to that 1) our method designs a novel solution for the problem of imbalance classification, and 2) the regression information in our proposed joint model improves
the classification performance.
Second, as shown in Figure 3, the correlation coefficient (i.e., 0.524) between
our predictions and the corresponding ground truths for the severe cases is larger
than the value (i.e., 0.462) in Table 4 which measures the correlation between
our predictions and the corresponding ground truths for all subjects. Moreover,
our proposed method yields the averaged conversion time (i.e., 4.59 ± 0.223
days, which has 0.55 days different from the ground truth of the conversion time,
i.e., 5.64 ± 4.30 days) from all non-serve cases to the severe stage, with the least
estimation error (i.e., 6.01 ± 1.22), compared to all comparison methods. The
possible reason should be the proposed joint classification and regression model,
where the classification information could improve the effectiveness of the regression task. Above advantages of our proposed method imply that our proposed
method is good at predicting the conversion time from the non-severe stage to the
severe stage.
Above two observations indicate that our proposed method is suitable for predicting the severe cases. In real applications, correctly classifying severe cases is
more important than correctly classifying the non-severe cases because the former
could reduce the clinicians?workloads. In particular, the correct prediction of the
conversion time could help the clinicians designing effective treatment plan for
the potential severe cases in time or even save the patients’ lives.
5.4. Limitations
This study yielded an accuracy of 85.91%, which seems lower than that reported in previous severity assessment work. However, the task in this paper tried
to solve is quite different, as we predict whether the patient would develop severe

21

symptom in the later time. This would result in the problem of imbalance classification since only a small portion of patients would convert severe based on the
prevalence rate. First, the problem of imbalance classification of our data set is
bias, i.e., 86 severe cases vs. 322 non-severe cases. This makes difficult to construct effective classification models. Second, the difference of infected volumes
between the severe cases and the non-severe cases is small, as shown in Figure 4,
while the corresponding difference is distinguished in Tang et al. (2020), thus the
latter can easily conduct classification. With the increase of available the data of
severe cases, the accuracy of our method could be further improved. In our future
work, we plan to generate new samples for the minority class to lessen the problem
of imbalance classification, as well as design new deep transfer learning methods
using other data sources (e.g., X-ray data) to solve the issue of small-sized sample
and high-dimensional features.
This study only focused on binary classification, i.e., severe cases vs. nonsevere cases. In our future work, we plan to conduct multi-class classification on
four types of COVID-19 diagnosis, i.e., mild, common, severe, and critical.
6. Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a new method to jointly conduct disease identification and conversion time prediction, by taking into account the issues, such as
high-dimensional data, small-sized sample, outlier influence, and imbalance classification. To do this, we designed a sparsity regularization term to conduct feature
selection and learn the shared information between two tasks, and proposed a new
method to take into account the sample weight and the issue of imbalance classification. Finally, experimental results showed that our proposed method achieved
the best performance for detecting the severe case from non-severe cases and the
conversion time from the mild confirmed case to the severe case with the CT data
in a real data set, compared to the comparison methods.
