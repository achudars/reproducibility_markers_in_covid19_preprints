In this note we discuss the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak from
the perspective of market-structure. We observe that US marketstructure has dramatically changed during the past four weeks and
that the level of change has followed the number of infected cases
reported in the USA. Presently, market-structure resembles most
closely the structure during the middle of the 2008 crisis but there
are signs that it may be starting to evolve into a new structure altogether. This is the first article of a series where we will be analysing
and discussing market-structure as it evolves to a state of further
instability or, more optimistically, stabilisation and recovery.

Motivations
COVID-19 outbreak is an unprecedented event in modern
human history with potentially catastrophic human consequences. While at the moment the focus is on saving human lives and preventing the virus spreading further, this
pandemic is also having profound effects on society, the economy and the financial system. Markets have seen significant
numbers of investors selling off and rebalancing their portfolios with less risky assets. This has resulted in large losses and
high volatilities, typical of crisis periods. We aim to better
understand present market dynamics with the scope of the
containment and possible prevention of future periods of extreme market instability and their consequent effects on the
economy and people’s lives.

Methods

Fig. 2. Comparison between the number of COVID-19 infected cases in US and the
logarithm of the ratio between the likelihood of the bull-state (green bars in Fig.1) and
the stress-state (blue bars in Fig.1). The period is from December 15 2019 to March
20 2020.

We used the unsupervised clustering methodology described
in (1) to automatically extract four inherent marketstructures associated with a set of 623 equities continuously
traded in the US market during the period from February
1999 to March 20, 2020. The clustering was performed by
maximising the following adjusted log-likelihood:

2008 crisis is associated with a state (blue bars) that has again
become prevalent during the last few weeks (see inset). We
compare the likelihood of this ‘crisis’ state with the likelihood
associated with the state which is instead prevalent during
the long ‘bull’ period post 2008 (green bars). The result is
shown in Fig.2 where the logarithm of the ratio between the
likelihoods of the crisis and bull states is reported. We note
that the bull-state prevails until February 2020 producing a
negative log-ratio, afterwards the crisis-state becomes more
representative and eventually becomes extremely dominant
in March. The timing of the surge in the dominance of the
crisis-state is consistent with that of the surge of US confirmed COVID-19 cases. It must be pointed out that this is
an initial analysis and developing a definitive representation
is hampered by a current lack of observations. However our
very latest analysis, which is still in the initial stage, suggests
the present market state may ultimately be classified as distinct from that of the 2008 crisis with some similarities with
the late 90’ states. We will publish further results as they
become available.

where Xt ∈ Rn,1 is the vector of log-returns at time t;
µk ∈ Rn,1 is the vector of the expected values for cluster
k; Jk ∈ Rn,n is the sparse precision matrix for cluster k computed via the LoGo method (see (2, 3)); γ is a parameter
penalizing state switching. In the present analysis we use
γ = 100, but results are consistent across a large range of
values of this parameter. Note that the present approach is
slightly different from (1) where the Mahalanobis distance was
minimized instead. It was indeed noticed already in (1) that
clustering through likelihood maximisation is more efficient in
detecting states of market stress. The results reported in this
note refer to the case of four clusters but the outcomes are
robust with respect to the number of clusters and analogous
results can be obtained for two or six clusters as well.
