Abstract: The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
disease (COVID-19) has posed a serious threat to global health. As no specific therapeutics are yet
available to control disease evolution, more in-depth understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms
induced by SARS-CoV-2 will help to characterize new targets for the management of COVID-19.
The present study identified a specific set of biological pathways altered in primary human lung
epithelium upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a comparison with SARS-CoV from the 2003 pandemic
was studied. The transcriptomic profiles were also exploited as possible novel therapeutic targets,
and anti-signature perturbation analysis predicted potential drugs to control disease progression.
Among them, Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), serine-threonine kinase (AKT),
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and I kappa B Kinase (IKK) inhibitors emerged as
candidate drugs. Finally, sex-specific differences that may underlie the higher COVID-19 mortality
in men are proposed.

Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a member of the
Coronaviridae family, isolated at the end of 2019. It was on December the 31st, 2019, that the Chinese
authorities for the first time reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) a series of pneumonia
cases of unknown aetiology in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China [1], and it was on January the 9th,
2020, that the Chinese Centre for Disease Prevention and Control declared that a novel coronavirus
(initially named 2019-nCoV) was the causative agent [1]. The infection spreads rapidly in the
population, mainly through respiratory droplets and close contact, with an

incubation period

ranging from 2 to 14 days [2]. The rapid propagation of the disease led the WHO to declare the state
of “public health emergency of international concern” on January the 30th, 2020, and on March the
11th, 2020, the WHO declared the Pandemic [3]. As of 09/04/2020, more than 1.4 million infected and
almost 90 thousand of deaths have been reported (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novelcoronavirus-2019/situation-reports/). However, the number of the infected are probably underestimated, since the majority of cases are asymptomatic or show mild symptoms, such as dry cough,
sore throat, and fever [4]. Even if there are many similarities with other coronaviruses, its high
diffusion over the population in combination with the possibility to develop various fatal
complications, including organ failure, septic shock, pulmonary edema, severe pneumonia, and
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), make this virus a major problem for the public health
[5]. It has been shown that males are more susceptible to COVID-19, reporting a prevalence between
55% and 68% [6] and increased clinical severity and mortality [7]. However, the reason behind this
epidemiological difference is still not clear. In the last two months, due to the state of emergency, the
scientific community has prioritized the epidemiological studies on COVID-19 infection with
consequential emerging of limited information regarding the molecular basis of the disease. In this
paper, we have studied the transcriptomic profile of primary human lung epithelium infected by
SARS-CoV-2, focusing on the most relevant pathways modulated during the infection and correlated
their role to sex genes, providing a molecular hypothesis of the gender-differences observed from the
clinical data. Then, we have performed a computational analysis to find new drugs candidates, based
on their ability to modulate oppositely the transcriptional profiles.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Dataset selection
The NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) was
manually searched using the MeSH term (Medical Subject Headings) “SARS-CoV-2”, “COVID-19”
and “SARS”. The datasets were selected if they met the following criteria: (a) whole-genome
transcriptomic profiling; (b) species of origin “Homo sapiens”; and (c) were not generated on cancer
cell lines. Finally, two datasets were included: GSE147507 [8] and GSE47963 [9]. Briefly, the
GSE147507 dataset included 3 independent biological replicates of primary human lung epithelium
that were mock treated or infected with SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) at a MOI (Multiplicity Of
Infection) of 2, for 24h. For the generation of this dataset, mRNA enriched libraries were prepared
from total RNA using tTruSeq Stranded mRNA LP. cDNA libraries were sequenced using an
Illumina NextSeq 500 platform. Raw sequencing reads were then aligned to the human genome
(hg19) using the RNA-Seq Alignment App on Basespace (Illumina, CA, USA). The GSE47963 dataset
included data from human airway epithelium cultures infected with SARS-CoV at a MOI of 2 or mock
controls, for increasing time points (24-96h). Transcriptomic profiling was performed using the
Agilent 4×44K human HG arrays. The submitter-supplied pre-preprocessed and normalized gene
expression matrix was used for the analysis.

2.2. Network analysis
The GeneMania database [10] was used to construct the network of the Differentially Expressed
Genes (DEGs). Interaction data were defined as physical interaction, co-expression, predicted, colocalization, pathway, genetic interactions, and shared protein domains. The Cytoscape software [11]

was used for the visualization of the network, with color-coded nodes based on the fold-change, and
to perform network analysis, using the NetworkAnalyzer utility. Topological analysis was performed
considering the network as undirected (i.e., containing only undirected edges). Centrality of each
node in the network was ranked based on degree centrality, that corresponds to the number of edges
linked to each given node. Closeness centrality and Betweeness centrality were also computed.
Closeness centrality is a measure of how fast information spreads from a given node to other nodes
in the network, while Betweenness centrality quantifies the number of times a node acts as a bridge
along the shortest path between two other nodes. MCODE (Molecular Complex Detection) was used
for module analysis of the network in Cytoscape [12]. The criteria of MCODE were as follows: degree
cutoff = 2, node cutoff = 0.2, maximum depth = 100, and k-score = 2.

2.3. Enrichment analysis
Functional enrichment analysis was conducted using the web-based utility, Metascape [13].
Metascape analysis is based on publicly available databases, e.g. Gene Ontology, KEGG, and
MSigDB. Metascape automatically aggregates enriched terms into non-redundant groups, by
calculating the pairwise similarity between any two terms [13]. Metascape uses the hypergeometric
test and Benjamini–Hochberg p value correction algorithm to identify statistically significant
enriched ontology terms.
For the identification of transcription factors and the comparative analysis of SARS-CoV2
induced-phenotype with the normal lung tissue, the Enrichr (http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr)
web-based utility was used [14]. To this aim, the Encode_CHEA_Consensus_TFs and the GTEx
libraries were considered. EnrichR computes the p value using the Fisher’s exact test. The adjusted
p-value is calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg method for correction for multiple hypotheses
testing. The z-score is computed using a modification to the Fisher exact test and assesses the
deviation from the expected rank. Finally, the Combined Score is calculated by p value and the zscore (Combined Score = ln(p value) × z-score).
2.4. Drug Prediction Analysis
The L1000FDW web-based utility [15] was used to identify potential drugs for the treatment of
COVID-19. L1000FWD computes the similarity between a gene expression profile and the Library of
Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS)-L1000 data, in order to prioritize drugs
potentially able to reverse the input transcriptional feature [15]. The L1000 transcriptomic database
belongs to the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) project, a NIH
Common Fund program, and includes the transcriptional profiles of ~50 human cell lines upon
exposure to approximately 20,000 compounds, in a range of concentrations and time [15].

2.5. Statistical Analysis
For the differential expression analysis of the GSE147507 dataset, the VOOM (mean-variance
modelling at the observational level) algorithm was used. The VOOM method estimates the meanvariance relationship of the log-counts, generates a precision weight for each observation and enters
these into the limma empirical Bayes analysis [16]. The analysis of the GSE47963 dataset was
performed using the LIMMA function. The cloud-based application WebMeV (Multiple Experiment
Viewer) was used for the statistical analyses [17]. Genes with an adjusted p value < 0.05 and a ǀfold
changeǀ > 2 were identified as DEGs (Differentially Expressed Genes) and selected for further
analysis.
Linear regression and Spearman’s correlation were performed to compare the fold change of
genes modulated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and following SARS-CoV infection, at different time
points.

Differences in the Combined Score for the enrichment of the lung tissue profile between women
and men, stratified by age, was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test, followed by Benjamini–
Hochberg multiple test correction procedure.
The GraphPad Prism (v. 8) software (San Diego, CA, USA) was used for the statistical analysis
and the generation of the graphs. Unless otherwise stated, a p value<0.05 was considered for
statistical significance.
3. Results
3.1. Network and enrichment analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection
In order to identify a specific gene signature characterizing SARS-CoV-2 infection, we first
interrogated the GSE147507 dataset. We identified 129 DEGs, 94 upregulated and 35 downregulated
(Figure 1A). MCODE analysis identified 7 main clusters of associated genes (Figure 1B; suppl. File 1).
Gene term enrichment analysis for the upregulated genes identified several altered pathways upon
SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the top three being: “cytokine-mediated signaling pathway”, “IL-17
signaling pathway”, and “defense response to other organism” (Fig. 1C). No significant enriched
term was instead found for the downregulated DEGs. Among the statistically significant enriched
terms, intracellular pathways related to NFkB, toll-like receptors and MAPK were also found (Fig.
1C). Accordingly, analysis of the transcription factors putatively involved in the regulation of the
upregulated DEGs identified RELA (adj. p value=0.047), for its role to transcribe 9 out of the 94 DEGs,
i.e. BST2, IL32, TNIP1, ICAM2, TNFAIP3, MMP9, BIRC3, RND1 and ICAM1 (Figure 1D). Interestingly,
a number of DEGs were found to be modulated by sexual hormones, as ESR1 (Estrogen Receptor 1)
was found to be involved in the regulation of 4 DEGs (C3 and EDN1, among the upregulated genes;
and PDK4 and VTCN1, among the downregulated DEGs) and AR (Androgen Receptor) was found
to regulate 6 DEGs (CCL20 and CXCL1, among the upregulated genes, and THBD, HEY2, BBOX1 and
MYLK, among the downregulated genes) (Figure 1D and Suppl. File 1). Network analysis identified
as the top hub genes, MX1, IL8 and IFITM1 (table 1).

3.2. Comparison between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-CoV infection
We next wanted to compare the gene signature induced by SARS-COV-2 and SARS-CoV
infection. To this aim, we have interrogated the publicly available GSE47963 microarray dataset. We
have first performed a correlation analysis on the modulation of the genes perturbed upon SARSCoV- infection and the corresponding genes in GSE47963. To account for the differences in the
experimental setting, as well as the different technologies involved, we considered all the genes with
a raw p value<0.05, irrespective of the fold-change. A total of 2871 genes were found to be modulated
by SARS-CoV-2 and in common with the GSE47963 dataset. As shown in Figure 3A-B, a moderate
but significant correlation is found between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-CoV infection at 24h, which
increases when considering SARS-CoV infection at later time points. When a more stringent selection
of the DEGs is applied (i.e., adj. p value<0.05 and ǀfold-changeǀ> 2), among the upregulated genes,
only 1 gene is in common between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections at 24h (CXCL2), 6 genes
are in common between SARS-CoV-2 infection and SARS-CoV infection at 48h; 25 and 22 genes are
in common between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV at 72h and 96h, respectively (Figure 2C, suppl file
2). Accordingly, similar pathways are enriched between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection for
the 72h and 96h time points (Figure 2D). Among the downregulated genes, only 1 and 4 genes are in
common between SARs-CoV-2-19 and SARS-CoV at 72h and 96h, respectively (Figure 2E, suppl file
2).

3.3. Drug prediction analysis

Anti-signature perturbation analysis was performed using the DEGs identified for SARS-CoV-2
infection (Figure 3A). In Table 2, we have enlisted the potential drugs identified by the L1000FWD
analysis. Among them, the top three drugs are: BRD-K23875128, a Rho kinase inhibitor; SA-792728,
a sphingosine kinase inhibitor; and sirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor. Figure 3B shows the relative
percentage of the drugs based on their mode of action, which identifies the inhibitors of MEK, as the
most represented drug category (Figure 3B).

3.4. Similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 -related phenotype and the healthy lung tissue males and females
Analysis of the sex-specific enrichment of the COVID-19-related gene signature in the lung tissue of
healthy subjects was performed using the GTex library, implemented in the EnrichR utility. Overall,
47 and 87 samples of lung tissue were tested from females and males, respectively. As shown in
Figure 4, in the fourth decade of life, the female lung tissues has a more similar phenotype to that
induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection than identical tissues from men (p=0.019 by Mann-Whitney U
test). No significant differences were observed between male and female tissues in other decades of
age, although a similar trend is observed at the age of 50-59 years (Figure 4)

4. Discussion
Even though recent evidence indicate that most cases of COVID-19 have an asymptomatic or
subclinical course of infection, a significant proportion of patients develop flu-like symptoms of

variable severities that may require hospitalization. In addition, a group of high risk individuals has
been identified that include older people, individuals affected by other comorbidities, such as
diabetes and hypertension, and those with a history of smoking, who are susceptible to develop a
severe course of SARS-CoV-2 infection [18–20]. The percentage of lethality due to COVID-19 infection
varies greatly between different countries, for example from ~11% in Italy to ~1% in neighboring
Germany. The reasons for this are not entirely clear although some countries express lethality as case
fatality rates, others as infection fatality rates; the latter depending on the SARS-CoV-2 testing
capacity of individual countries. Different lethalities also depend on patient-related factors, including
comorbidities especially in older individuals. Development and severity of COVID-19 also appears
to depend on individual propensities for massive release of proinflammatory and immunoactivating
cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and
chemokines (CXC-chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) and CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) at the level of
the infected lung tissues and accumulating immune cells [2,21] developing a reaction known as
Cytokines Release Syndrome (CRS). This is likely to promote self-sustaining inflammatory processes
that may contribute to the development of respiratory failure and systemic, possibly lethal,
manifestations similar to those seen in patients with e.g. meningococcal sepsis: hyperthermia,
catastrophic multiple organ failure, shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation [22]. It is of
interest that CRS characterizes secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), that is an
under-recognized, hyperinflammatory syndrome characterized by a fulminant and fatal
hypercytokinaemia with multiorgan failure. In adults, sHLH is most commonly triggered by viral
infections and occurs in 3·7–4·3% of sepsis cases [21].
Predictors of fatality from a recent retrospective, multicenter study of 150 confirmed COVID-19 cases
in Wuhan, China, included elevated ferritin (mean 1297·6 ng/ml in non-survivors vs 614·0 ng/ml in
survivors; p<0·001) and IL-6 (p<0·0001), suggesting that mortality might be due to virally driven
hyperinflammation [2,21].
A “cytokine storm” underlying lethal outcomes of COVID-19 is also supported by anecdotical though
repeated observations that the anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab, appears to beneficially
influence the course of COVID-19. This has led to the initiation of Phase II and Phase III studies of
tocilizumab in these patients [23]. Other anti-inflammatory therapeutics, including glucocorticoids,
JAK inhibitors and choloroquine/hydrocholoroquine, may also improve patients’ prognosis [24]. It
should be noted, however, that the ability of glucocorticoids to block production of the potentially
most dangerous cytokines, TNF-α and IL-1𝛽, occurs largely at the genomic level therefore requiring
several hours for effective manifestation. This hampers the effectiveness of glucocorticoid therapies
in catastrophic situations where high amounts of these cytokines have already been released to the
circulation. In contrast, specific anti-cytokine antibodies or receptor antagonists clinical approved on
other indications would be expected to have an immediate neutralizing effect that might reduce
mortality.
The identification of the precise pathogenic mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 induces organ
damage are of immediate urgency. Unfortunately, emerging data seem to indicate that other organs
such as heart, kidney and the central nervous system may also be attacked, albeit in a more silent

fashion, by SARS-CoV-2 [25,26]. Indeed, patients may show proteinuria, elevated baseline serum
creatinine levels and hematuria [25], as well as neurological symptoms, that include headache,
epilepsy, disturbed consciousness, anosmia and dysgeusia [26]. Some COVID-19 patients also
develop a thrombogenic diathesis that is characterized by marked elevation of D-dimer and other
procoagulant parameters diverging from those observed during SARS infections [27]. Thus,
anticoagulant treatment is associated with decreased mortality in severe COVID-19 patients with
coagulopathy [28]. Understanding whether or not a cytokine storm also contributes to damage to
these organs or if other pathogenetic mechanisms operate is clearly needed to develop organ-tailored
therapeutic approaches.
While waiting for the eventual advent of a vaccine, other drugs used for different indications may be
repurposed to treat COVID-19 patients, as well. These include a few antiviral options under clinical
trial, e.g. remdesivir [29], and lopinavir/ritonavir given alone or in combination with interferon- and
hydroxychloroquine alone or with azitromicin (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04332107;
NCT04339816; NCT04336332; NCT04332094; NCT04335552; NCT04322123).
The use of whole-genome expression data has been extensively used by ourselves and others for the
identification of novel pathogenic pathways and therapeutic targets in several human pathologies
including, autoimmune diseases [30–32] and cancer [33,34]. Network analysis allows to extensive
testing of different biological features [35] and to extrapolate new information that otherwise would
be lost. Here, we have used computational methods and network analysis to better characterize the
cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting the molecular basis for the observed gender
differences and to predict possible new therapeutic targets. We exploited a publicly available RNAseq dataset, GSE147507, generated from primary lung cells upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 thus
extending analyses of the original data published by Blanco-Melo et al. [8]. We focused on
comparisons of the transcriptional signature induced by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV from the 2003
pandemic and on the molecular mechanisms likely involved in gender differences in COVID-19
susceptibility. Using an in silico-pharmacology approach, we have also presently predicted potential
drugs for COVID-19 treatment. Our work differs substantially from the study by Guzzi and
colleagues [36], as their study explores the SARS-CoV-2/host receptor recognition and makes use of
predicted functional interactions based on convergent SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) transcriptional profiles generated on established lung cancer
cells [36].
Our study revealed that many differentially expressed genes are involved in inflammation and
response to external organisms, such as S100A7A, CSF3, ICAM2, CCL20, CXCL3, IL6, CSF2, CXCL5,
IL8, ICAM1, OAS1. These genes are known to promote the recruitment and activation of granulocytes,
monocytes and macrophages proliferation and infiltration, that, as mentioned before, is one of the
key features of COVID-19. As expected, the most important transcription factor regulating the
response to COVID-19 is RELA, which is involved in NF-kB formation and controls both proliferative
and inflammatory cellular responses [37]. Interestingly, other representative transcription factors in

our network are implicated in mechanisms of DNA damage and repairing and chromatin remodeling
events, such as RAD21, CTCF, SPI1 and GATA2 [38–41].
To better understand the similarities between SARS infection, we also compared the transcriptomic
profile induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and SARS infections at different time points. The results
show that the transcriptomic signature induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection correlates better with the
latest stages of SARS infection and, accordingly, many biological pathways related to cytokine
response and host defense mechanisms are shared between COVID-19 24h and SARS 72h and 96h.
Hence, we propose that the accelerated cellular response to SARS-CoV-2, in comparison to SARS,
may explain the higher ability of SARS-CoV-2 to spread [2].
Next, by using an anti-signature analysis approach [42,43], we have predicted possible novel drug
options for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Even if the mechanism of action of most of the
predicted target molecules is not yet known, other targeting drugs are anti-inflammatory
(glucocorticoids) and anti-proliferative drugs, such as Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
(MEK), serine-threonine kinase (AKT), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and I kappa B
Kinase (IKK) inhibitors. In agreement with data by Zhou et al. [44], our analysis shows that the mTOR
inhibitor, sirolimus, may be a candidate drug for use in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, in an in vitro
study, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and
phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR signaling responses were previously found to be
modulated in response to the infection with another coronavirus, MERS-CoV [45]. Studies have also
shown that the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a key factor in regulating
the replication of viruses [45,46], and in patients with H1N1 pneumonia, early treatment with
corticosteroids and an rapamycin has been associated with improvement in hypoxia, multiple organ
dysfunction, virus clearance, and shortened time in ventilators [47]. Low-dose inhibitors of mTORC1
are also beneficial in the elderly by increasing immune function and reducing infections and
complications [48]. We have also generated in vivo proof-of-concept that sirolimus is effective in
prevention of HIV replication in a humanized SCID model [49] and have proposed the use of
rapamycin in HIV infection and its complications [50,51]. Subsequently, our in vivo data have been
replicated in the same model by Heredia et al., using an ATPase inhibitor of mTOR [52], and it has
been further extended by Latinoci et al., in a different mouse model of HIV infection, where they
showed the synergistic antiretroviral action of rapamycin with standard antiretroviral therapy [53].
Recent data have also demonstrated a possible antiretroviral action of rapamycin in HIV-infected
kidney transplant recipients. It appears therefore that an antiviral mode of action of rapamycin
coupled with its immunomodulatory potential that may dampen excessive production of
proinflammatory cytokines would warrant clinical studies with this drug in selected patients with
COVID-19 [54].
Despite this, we have to acknowledge the limitations of the present study. First, the differentially
expressed genes, that we have prioritized in our study, have been obtained from the analysis of an in
vitro model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hence the data may be incomplete, and functional associations
occurring in patients may be missing. Studies integrating lung-specific gene expression profiles with

the SARS-CoV-2 infection-related gene signature may help to better identify potential repurposable
drugs. Also, although some of our findings have been confirmed by various literature data, most of
the predicted repurposable drugs need to be validated and, for several of them, preclinical studies
are warranted to evaluate in vivo efficiency and side effects before clinical trials. Indeed, our
approach cannot identify dose–response and dose–toxicity effects for the candidate drugs.
Furthermore, drug combinations targeting multiple pathogenic pathways can be envisioned, as it has
been the case for standard antiretroviral therapy with rapamycin in a mouse model of HIV [53] .
Despite these limitations, our study can minimize the translational gap between preclinical data and
clinical application, which appears an issue of paramount relevance in view of the unprecedent social
and epidemiological emergence provoked from the rapid escalation of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
To decipher the reasons for the gender differences in COVID-19 susceptibility [2], we have compared
the transcriptomic profile of lung tissue from healthy women and men with the transcriptomic
induced by COVID-19. At ages between 40 and 60 years, the transcriptomic feature of the female lung
tissue was more similar to those induced by COVID-19 than in male tissue. A lower threshold of
acute response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in men may at least partly explaine the reduced incidence of
COVID-19 in women. This hypothesis will need to be weighed and validated on the ground of
appropriate epidemiological data that will allow to ascerain whether the apparent protection from
COVID-19 infection in famales is specifically observed in the above-indicated range of age. If so, next
question will be whether this ”physiological” observation may be translated into therapeutic
opportunity by dismantling those potential factors that might have contributed to the induction of
this ”COVID-19-resistant lung phenotype” in women of these ages. Clearly, female-specific hormonal
factors for example occurring just before or during the menopausal period can be implicated.
In this regard, it is notable that among the SARS-CoV-2-induced genes encoding the neutrophil
chemotactic factor CXCL1 and the predominantly dendritic cell chemotactic factor CCL20 are
regulated by androgen receptor AR (androgen receptor), whereas C3 and EDN1 are regulated by
ESR1 (estrogen receptor 1). AR plays a role in innate and adaptive immune regulations [55,56],
especially in the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages, that are been proven to be strongly
associated with COVID-19 in lung tissue [24]. Both CXCL1 and CCL20 emerged in the top 50 ranking
nodes in our network ordered by degree, and both are modulated even during SARS infection [57,58].
This suggests their involvement in different coronavirus infections and, in addition, a different role
in female and male responses to these infections.
It is noteworthy that ER is involved as regulators of immune responses by enhancing interferon
production and anti-viral response [59], and that selective oestrogen receptor modulators have been
proposed as potential drugs to treat coronavirus infection [44]. Toremifene, for example, potentially
affects several key host proteins associated with coronavirus: RPL19, HNRNPA1, NPM1, EIF3I,
EIF3F, and EIF3E. Taken together, these convergent observations point to mechanisms that may
explain the lower female incidence and/or lethality of COVID-19 offering candidate therapeutic
options in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
5. Conclusions

COVID-19 is a severe infection currently spreading as a pandemic. Here, we have investigated the
transcriptomic profile of primary human lung cells upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, characterizing
the most activated intracellular pathways and in order to provide a molecular explanation for the
gender differences in the clinical manifestations. Finally, we have identified new potential drugs for
COVID-19 therapies. We found that targeting the mTOR pathway could be a promising therapeutic
avenue to fight COVID-19, improving symptomatology and reducing mortality rates.
