Abstract
The recent spread of Covid-19 (Coronavirus disease) all over the world has made
it one of the most important and discussed topic nowadays. Since its outbreak in
Wuhan, several investigations have been carried out aiming to describe and
support the containment of the disease spread. Here, we revisit well-established
concepts of epidemiology, the Ising-model, and percolation theory. Also, we
employ a spin S = 1/2 Ising-like model and a (logistic) Fermi-Dirac-like function
to describe the spread of Covid-19. Our analysis reinforces well-established
literature results, namely: i) that the epidemic curves can be described by a
Gaussian-type function; ii) that the temporal evolution of the accumulative
number of infections and fatalities follow a logistic function, which has some
resemblance with a distorted Fermi-Dirac-like function; iii) the key role played by
the quarantine to block the spread of Covid-19 in terms of an interacting
parameter, which emulates the contact between infected and non-infected
people. Furthermore, in the frame of elementary percolation theory, we show
that: i) the percolation probability can be associated with the probability of a
person being infected with Covid-19; ii) the concepts of blocked and non-blocked
connections can be associated, respectively, with a person respecting or not the
social distancing, impacting thus in the probability of an infected person to infect
other people. Increasing the number of infected people leads to an increase in the
number of net connections, giving rise thus to a higher probability of new
infections (percolation). We demonstrate the importance of social distancing in
preventing the spread of Covid-19 in a pedagogical way. Given the impossibility of
making a precise forecast of the disease spread, we highlight the importance of
taking into account additional factors, such as climate changes and urbanization,
in the mathematical description of epidemics. Yet, we make a connection
between the standard mathematical models employed in epidemics and
well-established concepts in condensed matter Physics, such as the Fermi gas and
the Landau Fermi-liquid picture.
Keywords: Covid-19; percolation theory; Ising-model; logistic function.

1 Introduction
In the field of epidemics, every hour counts and there is an urge in predicting
the temporal evolution of the disease aiming to find the best way to deal with it
and to establish a proper control of its spread. Recently, the pandemic Covid-19
(Coronavirus disease) has been rapidly spreading all over the world, being needless
to mention the impact of it in our lives in a broad context, see, e.g., Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7]. It has been proposed that such a quick spread of Covid-19 in human beings

Mello et al.

Page 2 of 33

is associated with a spike protein, which in turn has a site that is triggered by an
enzyme called furin. The latter lies dangling on the surface of the virus, leading
thus unfortunately to the infection of human cells much more easily [8]. Therefore,
there is an urgency of an appropriate mathematical description of the spread of
Covid-19 aiming to contain the disease. This is particularly true aiming to support
the health government agencies all over the world to maximize the effectiveness of
medical support strategy in such a global crisis.
1.1 The SIR model
In the field of epidemiology [9, 10, 11, 12, 13], several mathematical approaches
aiming to describe the infectious disease spread have been employed. Among them,
the SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Removed) model [11, 14, 15, 16, 17] stands out.
Such a model considers the contact transmission risk, the average number of contacts between people as a function of time t, and the time that a person remains
infected and thus can infect others. The latter enable us to infer the average number
of people R0 directly infected. The value of R0 usually dictates if the disease will
eventually disappear (R0 < 1), if an endemic will take place (R0 = 1) or even if
there will be an epidemic (R0 > 1) [11]. Furthermore, three variables provide key
information about the disease, namely the fraction of people S that are susceptible
of being infected, the fraction of people I 0 that are already infected and can thus
infect others, and the fraction of people R that becomes immune to the disease.
The epidemic curve is achieved employing the following three coupled first-order
differential equations [11]:

where β 0 is the contact transmission risk, κ is the average number of contacts between people as a function of time, and D refers to the time that a person remains
infected and, as a consequence, can infect others. Also, using the previously defined
parameters R0 can be written as R0 = β 0 κD. Although the system of differential
equations defined in the frame of the SIR model describes nicely the behavior of
epidemics, the β 0 , κ, and consequently, R0 factors are considered constant. However,
such factors can be changed over time influenced by other parameters such as social
distancing, for instance. Thus, a time dependence of β 0 and κ has to be taken into
account, cf. discussion in Refs. [18, 19]. Given the non-linearity of the system of equations, the mathematical solution is non-trivial, being numerical analysis required in
many cases. Now, for the sake of completeness, we will analyze each differential
equation separately. The negative sign in Eq. 1 indicates that S(t) decreases monotonically with time. Note that the factor β 0 κSI is also present in Eq. 2, but with
opposite sign, i.e., as the number of infected people increases, less people are indeed
susceptible, since a fraction of the susceptible people has now become infected. Also,
Eq. 3 takes into account the ratio between infected people and the duration of the

Mello et al.

Page 3 of 33

infection, also called incubation time, being such a ratio proportional to the number of people recovering from the disease. This factor, namely I 0 /D, is negative in
Eq. 2, as expected, since recovered people are no longer part of the group of infected
people. As previously mentioned, the set of three equations enables us to obtain the
epidemic curve for an infectious disease. In order to discuss the SIR model and its

respective generated epidemic curves in a comprehensive way, we have applied such
a model for Covid-19, SARS, and Ebola in order to discuss the implications of the
disease spread for distinct R0 factors (Fig. 1). Note that the higher value of R0 is
associated with Covid-19, most likely due to its relatively easy infection because of
the furin enzyme. Figure 1 shows the epidemic curves employing the parameters R0
and D reported in the literature for the case of Covid-19 [20], SARS [21], and Ebola
[22]. The number of susceptible people S in panel a) of Fig. 1 for Covid-19 decreases
more rapidly than SARS and Ebola, which is a direct consequence from the fact
that Covid-19 presents a higher R0 factor when compared with the other diseases.
As a consequence, the number of infected people over time depicted in panel b) of
Fig. 1 increases more rapidly and thus the number of immune people R from Covid19 in panel c) of Fig. 1 increases more slowly due to the quick spread of the disease.
In summary, Fig. 1 shows the typical epidemic curves for each disease spread here
considered, in the frame of the SIR model. Note that the SIR model, through the
knowledge of R0 (β 0 , κ, D), enables us to infer predictions about the spread of the
disease. According with recent works, environmental factors such as the weather,
can also be taken into account when treating a disease spread [23]. Such an analysis is key in predicting the epidemiologic curves during seasonal changes in some
countries. Essentially, environmental factors, i.e., temperature changes, can impact
on the floating time of respiratory droplets in the atmosphere, leading thus to an
enhancement of the infection probability. Such an influence of the environment on
the spread of the disease can be associated with the β 0 factor in the light of the SIR
model. In practical terms, several factors enable us to minimize the risk of infection.
For example, in the context of the SIR model, upon joining the quarantine both β 0
and κ are reduced, since the number of contacts between people is lowered in the
same way as the probability of being infected. On the other hand, upon going to the
supermarket using a face mask, for instance, β 0 can be lowered but not necessarily

Mello et al.

κ since there will still be contact between people. Such actions are not only important on containing the disease spread, but also are key in preventing the resurgence,
or small new outbreaks. In a broader context, other mathematical models can be
used to investigate the spread of diseases, such as MSEIR, MSEIRS, SEIR, SEIRS,
SIRS, SEI, SEIS, SI, and SIS, where M is passively immune infants and E is the
exposed people in the latent period [25, 26]. However, as pointed out in Ref. [24],
the simple application of the SIR model, for instance, is naive and does not suffice
to describe the spread of Covid-19. Given the various involved factors, a broader
analysis considering, for instance, social aspects and urbanization, is required. Such
aspects are discussed in Section 6.
1.2 The Ising-model and the Covid-19 outbreak
It is evident that the mathematical models aforementioned used to describe the
spread of epidemics are not built based on concepts of Statistical Physics. However,
an adaptation of the Ising-model can be made to describe the Covid-19 spread.
Hence, in what follows we discuss the celebrated Ising-model [27]. Although initially
proposed for describing magnetic systems, over the last decades the Ising-model has
been revealed as an appropriate tool to describe several phenomena. Indeed, this
includes the supercooled phase of water [28], the vicinity of the Mott critical end
point [29, 30, 31], magnetic field-induced quantum critical points [32], econophysics
[33], democratic elections [34, 35], as well as the spread of diseases [36, 37, 38, 39],
just to mention a few examples. Before discussing the adaptation of the Isingmodel for the description of the Covid-19 spread, we recall here the classical onedimensional Ising-model [40, 41]. In order to make a brief review of such a model,
we focus here on the case of applied longitudinal magnetic field. Essentially, the
quintessence of the Ising-model lies on the assumption that magnetic moments are
coupled only with their nearest neighbors, being the Hamiltonian of a linear chain
of N spins given by [41]:

H = −Ji,i+1

N
X
i=1

Si Si+1 − B

N
X

Si ,

(4)

i=1

where Ji,i+1 is the coupling constant between neighboring magnetic moments on
sites i and i + 1, Si (Si+1 ) represents the spin on a site i (i + 1), and B refers
to the longitudinal applied magnetic field. At this point, it is worth emphasizing
that the coupling constant Ji,i+1 , also called magnetic exchange coupling constant,
will be used to emulate the contact between infected and non-infected people in
our approach. Next, we make use of the Ising-model [27], logistic function [42] and
percolation theory (to be introduced in Section 5) to describe the spread of Covid19. We demonstrate the close relation between the number of people following the
proposed quarantine by the WHO (World Health Organization) and the spread of
Covid-19. Real examples of the effectiveness of the social distance can be found, for
instance, in Brazil upon comparing the Covid-19 spread between Belo Horizonte
- MG and São Paulo - SP. Since its outbreak in Brazil, the number of both new
cases and fatalities reported for São Paulo city are still increasing up to date and
represent the higher number of cases in the country [43, 44]. On the other hand,

Mello et al.

Page 5 of 33

Belo Horizonte is still reporting on very low number of both new cases and fatalities
due to Covid-19, demonstrating clearly the result of an early and very strick social
distancing. Although it is quite obvious that the more people respect the quarantine
the lower will be the number of infected people, a proper quantitative description
is still lacking. Unfortunately, for many governmental leaders around the world,
it is not obvious that the quarantine is crucial in containing the Covid-19 disease
spread. It is worth mentioning a recent analysis about the so-called Digital Herd
Immunity, reported in Ref. [45], where there is a tracking of Covid-19 infected people through a smartphone applicative. Interestingly enough, the critical fraction of
people using such applicative for the containment of the Covid-19 spread is about
75% of the population. The latter means that if the entire population, infected or
not, are tracked by the applicative and respect the social distancing, the spread of
the disease is contained. This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we present
a discussion about the adaptation of the Ising-model to the Covid-19 spread and
deduce, in a pedagogical way, the logistic function, applying it in the description
of both the number of infections and fatalities due to Covid-19. In Section 3, we
present an analogy between the electron interaction in condensed matter Physics
and the interaction between infected and non-infected people in epidemics. A comparison between the logistic function and the SIR model is presented in Section
4. In Section 5, we present a comprehensive review of the percolation theory, the
Cayley tree, and the Bethe lattice aiming to describe the behavior of the Covid-19
spread in the context of percolation theory. Conclusions and perspectives are also
presented.

2 Covid-19 Spread, Infections and Fatalities
2.1 The genesis of the interaction parameter
Under the light of condensed matter Physics, we consider that the interaction
(contact) δε between infected and non-infected people can be associated with the
magnetic exchange interaction between nearest-neighbour magnetic moments in
the well-established Ising-model [31, 28, 46, 47], cf. discussions in the previous
Section. Hence, analogously to the case of the Ising-model for magnetism with
N spins S = 1/2, we assume that the number of infected people pi = +1/2 is
N + , while the number of non-infected people pi = −1/2 is labelled by N − , being
(N + + N − ) = N where N is the total number of considered habitants. In other
words, infected and non-infected people can be identified considering a S = 1/2

PN
Ising-like variable pi = +1/2, −1/2, so that we write N + = i=1 2 pi + 12 pi , and

PN
N − = i=1 2 pi − 12 pi . The latter enable us to select mathematically infected
and non-infected people, respectively. Yet, we consider that two people who are infected by Covid-19 have no effect on each other, so that in this case the interaction
δε = 0 and, otherwise, δε 6= 0. In the same way, a non-infected person has no effect
in another non-infected person. Essentially, in our approach δε quantifies, at some
extent, the key role played by the quarantine in the spread of Covid-19. Note that
δε plays a similar role than κ in the frame of the SIR model, discussed previously.
Following a similar mathematical treatment reported by us elsewhere, cf. Ref. [31],
we write a mathematical function to describe the total population CT taking into

Mello et al.

account the contact between non-infected and infected people, which is emulated
by δε:

where Ch is the total number of healthy people before the spread of the virus and
pj refers to a neighbour person of pi . Note that the second term of the right side of
Eq. 5 will always be negative for pi = +1/2 and pj = −1/2 and vice-versa. Although
the various applications of the Ising-model to distinct research areas are known in
the literature, as discussed in the Introduction section, Equation 5 provides a new
way of mathematically selecting infected (pi = +1/2) and a non-infected person
(pj = −1/2) taking into account the interaction parameter δε. Furthermore, Eq. 5
indicates that, when δε 6= 0, i.e., infected people interact with healthy people, Ch
is decreased. Evidently, the total number of the population remains constant. It is
worth mentioning that even in a hypothetical situation in which all the population
joins the quarantine, there would still be a small finite δε originated from household
interactions, which are usually longer and more frequent and thus, under certain
circumstances, can lead to new infections. In order to determine a proper mathematical expression for δε, one must take into account the number of isolated people
n in quarantine. We propose that the contact between infected and non-infected
people can be described considering δε ∝ n−1/2 , with 1 < n < N . As a matter of
fact, we have employed different power-laws for δε in terms of n, but it turns out
that δε ∝ n−1/2 provides an appropriate fit for the data set. This is a reasonable
assumption, since as the number of people in quarantine decreases, the contact between them increases, which, in the present scenario, is represented mathematically
by an increase in δε. Note that Eq. 5 does not incorporate any time evolution.
2.2 The Gaussian-type function and Gaussian processes
It turns out that upon analyzing already officially reported epidemic curves [48, 49]
for Covid-19, their typical time evolution in terms of new cases per day follows an
initial rapid increase of the number of infected people, which is usually assumed to
be exponential. After such initial exponential growth, the number of infected people
reaches a threshold value and starts decreasing monotonically as time continues
to evolve. Essentially, in qualitative terms, the typical shape of epidemic curves
is more or less the one of a simple Gaussian-type function. At this point, it is
worth mentioning that although the epidemics data set here discussed follows the
behavior of a Gaussian function, our analysis has nothing to do with a probability
distribution. For the sake of completeness, we recall the mathematical expression
for the Gaussian function:
y(t) = y0 +

w

(t−tc )2
A
p π e−2 w2 ,

(6)

where y0 is related with an initial value, A is a normalization constant associated
with the area under the curve, t is the time, tc is the value of t associated with
the maximum value of y(t), and w = 2σ, where σ is the standard deviation. Hence,

Mello et al.

Page 7 of 33

following a similar analysis employed by the authors of Ref. [34], we make use here of
a simple Gaussian function to describe the spread of Covid-19. In our analysis, the
interaction between infected and non-infected people is incorporated in the Gaussian
function by summing up n1/2 ∝ δε−1 in tc and w into the Gaussian function. The
incorporation of δε in terms of the probability of a person being infected is discussed
into details in Subsection 5.2. We stress that in our analysis, we have summed up
δε−1 , as previously described, based on the argument that when the number of
people n in quarantine is increased, the contact between infected and non-infected
people is reduced and, as a consequence, δε−1 is increased. Essentially, we have
summed up δε−1 as follows:
y(t) = y0 +

[t−(tc +δε−1 )]2
A
−2
(w+δε−1 )2
p
e
.
(w + δε−1 ) π2

(7)

This gives rise to a broadening of the Gaussian distribution function, so that w
is increased and its maximum is reduced. Note that by doing so, the area under
the curve remains constant. It is worth emphasizing that our analysis based on the
incorporation of δε in the Gaussian function was only possible due to the Isinglike model that we have introduced previously, within which δε has its genesis.
We emphasize that the modeling of the epidemic curves is performed by assuming that there are several additional parameters ruling the global behavior of the
time evolution of the key factors incorporated in the SIR model, i.e., the number
of infected, recovered and susceptible people. However, it is important to reinforce
that a real disease spread depends on an ensemble of parameters, which are not
usually taken into account to describe the global dynamics of the epidemic curves.
These additional factors cannot be modelled by employing solely elementary analytic functions. Thus, in such cases, Gaussian processes may be implemented in the
model to increase the accuracy of best-fit solutions describing the time evolution of
the epidemics parameters. Essentially, Gaussian processes can be understood in the
following way: suppose we have a given phenomenon (in our case, the number of
infected (I 0 ), recovered (R) and susceptible (S) people in the light of an epidemic)
to be modeled as a function of time t. There is a set of well-determined parameters
which are responsible for dictating the predominant behavior regarding the time
evolution of these particular parameters, cf. Eqs. 1, 2, and 3. However, other factors
may play a minor, although non-negligible, role in modeling the epidemic curve. A
simple example of a factor which could change the epidemic curve is the weather.
It is known that weather prediction is one of the most difficult tasks in modern predictive analysis due to the intrinsically stochastic aspect of this phenomenon. If the
virus corresponding to a given epidemic presents a “weakness” to, e.g., hot weather,
an abrupt change in the temperature may cause small fluctuations in the number
of infected people over a short period of time. Such a period of time is comparable to the timespan in which the temperature remains relatively high. Supposing
that these temperature fluctuations take place for some days in a given timespan,
one has a stochastic variable adding a “noise” to the behavior, for instance, of the
number of susceptible people over time S(t). The Gaussian processes is thus an
algorithm for introducing these kind of random fluctuations in the epidemic model.

Mello et al.

Page 8 of 33

The so-called Gaussian aspect is attributed to the way in which the noise is added.
It is known that a sequence of randomly generated points can be approximated
by a Gaussian distribution function for large values of the number of data points,
being such result known as the Central Limit Theorem. Thus, the incorporation
of randomly generated fluctuations in the deterministic portion of S(t) implies a
more complete modeling. Indeed, this is true not only for the deterministic nature
of S(t), already described by the SIR model, but also to the noise introduced by, for
instance, the weather variation and its impact on the survival of the virus causing
the given disease. The goal is, eventually, to determine which value of standard
deviation σ better suits the Gaussian processes, i.e., the one which minimizes the
deviation between the actual data of the epidemic curve and the model curve described by S(t) = S(t)det + S(t)gauss , where S(t)det is the deterministic part of
the function S(t) and S(t)gauss is the stochastic contribution to the function S(t).
Of course, such modelling requires a more complex implementation. In Ref. [50] an
example of a public available code to model a Gaussian process in one dimension
is reported. Note, however, that such procedures are random in nature and serve
only the purpose of increasing the accuracy of the fits by taking into account a
detrending process. We thus mention here the existence of such methods, but we do
not implement them in the current work, since no additional insights can be gained
in the discussions related to the spread of Covid-19.
2.3 The logistic and the Fermi-Dirac-like function applied to epidemics
Given the relatively large amount of available data for China and the achievement
of a proper control of the spread of Covid-19 in its territory, in the following we
pedagogically deduce the logistic function by making use of the also celebrated
standard population growth model [51, 52]. We assume a maximum number of
possible infected people labelled by P ; considering I(t) the number of infected people
at a given time t and, as consequence, [P − I(t)] is the number of people that can be
infected. Note that [ P −I(t)
] corresponds to the percentage of the population that
P
will be infected. Also, we consider
that
h
i the number of people that can be infected by
I(t) in a time interval ∆t is P −I(t)
n∗ ∆t, where n∗ quantifies how many times an
P
infected person interacts with a non-infected person. The number of infected people
in a time (t + ∆t) minus the number of infected people at t is proportional to the
number of people of the population that can be infected by the already existent
infected people at a given time t. Hence, it is straightforward to write:
I(t + ∆t) − I(t)

where K is a non-universal proportionality constant. Upon taking the limit for

where m is a non-universal integration constant. Equation 10 has some reminiscence
of the well-known Fermi-Dirac (FD) distribution function [53]. Interestingly, Eq. 10
is also typically employed in chemical kinetics [54], anaerobic biodegradability tests
[55], and even on germination curves [56]. It provides a robust description for the
evolution of the number of infected people I(t) over time, saturating at P . Also,
Eq. 9 can be recognized as the well-established logistic differential equation [51],
which has a general solution of the type [57]:
g(x) =

L
e−k(x−x0 )

+1

,

(11)

where k is the growth rate of the function, L is the maximum number of g(x), and
x0 is the midpoint value of the function. Thus, Eq. 10 can be rewritten in a similar
way of Eq. 11:
I(t) =

P

e−C(t−t0 ) + 1

(12)

Note that Eq. 12 is equivalent to Eq. 10 if we consider m = eCt0 . The logistic function
can also be written in the trigonometric form as the distribution function:

(13)

Although Eq. 10 is essentially the well-known logistic function, we will consider
it under the view of condensed matter Physics as a Fermi-Dirac-type (FD-type)
function. This is because of their mathematical similarities. The data set for Covid19 here discussed are available in Ref.[58]. It is worth mentioning that we have
focused our analysis in countries presenting a more advanced picture of the Covid19 spread, such as South Korea and China [58].
2.4 Data analysis and discussion for the case of infections
We start our analysis recalling the data set for Ebola, SARS, and Influenza A/H1N1.
Their epidemic curves, depicted in Fig. 2, can be described by a fitting employing

it is worth emphasizing that it is not possible to make a forecast of an epidemic

initial growth of the epidemic curve. Now, we focus on the analysis of the spread
of Covid-19. We start with the available data set for Covid-19 in South Korea, see
Fig. 3 a). The number of people joining the quarantine is directly associated with
the previously defined interaction (contact) δε between infected and non-infected
people. As discussed, in a hypothetical situation where no one joins the quarantine
n → 0 and so δε achieves its maximum value, which means that everyone interacts
freely with each other. This would be the worst case at all. It has been broadly
discussed that upon increasing the number of infected people in quarantine, the
maximum in the epidemic curve associated with the number of new cases is not only
lowered, but it is also shifted, indicating that the spread of Covid-19 will be more
contained. The latter corresponds to the desired situation in terms of controlling
the spread, since the health government agencies will have more time to manage the

situation. This is one of the reasons why a proper registration of the epidemic data
is crucial. Note that our analysis based on the Ising-like model incorporates the key
role played by social distancing, broadly discussed in the media, see, e.g., Ref. [62].
We demonstrate such a situation employing the data set available for South Korea,
assuming a hypothetical finite δε incorporated in the Gaussian function employed
in the analysis, cf. depicted in the inset of Fig. 3 a). More specifically, when δε is
lowered the maximum number of infected people is decreased and its position in

Mello et al.

Page 12 of 33

time is shifted, making thus the disease spread more controllable. Such a decrease
in δε represents more people joining the quarantine and thus avoiding contact with
each other. Interestingly, the number of infected people I 0 over time in the frame of
the SIR model, depicted in Fig. 1 b), for the various diseases resembles the behavior
of the number of new cases over time shown in the inset of Fig. 3 for Covid-19. Such
a resemblance of the role played by δε and R0 is due to the fact R0 depends on
κ, which in turn represents an average interaction between people in a similar way
than δε. Indeed, the R0 factor can be written in terms of κ, namely R0 = β 0 κD
[11]. Since R0 is connected with the average number of contacts between people
as a function of time κ, upon decreasing R0 as shown in Fig. 1 b) the shape of
the infected people over time is broadened in the same way as in Fig. 3 a) when
δε is lowered. Essentially, both behaviors strengthen the importance of respecting
the social distancing and thus minimizing the average number of contacts between
people. Now, we treat the available data set of the spread of Covid-19 in China in
terms of the FD-like distribution function. As depicted in Fig. 3 b), the number of
accumulated infected people versus elapsed time starts to saturate after roughly 50
days after the outbreak of Covid-19. In other words, for large values of t the ratio
I(t)/P → 1. Equation 10 fits nicely such data set, cf. Fig. 3 b). Note that the number
of infected people over time for China is marked by a small outbreak at t ≈ 40 days,
cf. Fig. 3 b). Such a small outbreak can be due to several distinct factors, such as the
flexibilization of social distancing or even due to a lack of attention of the population
in taking the basic hygiene cares. In the following, we discuss into more details the
similarity between Eq. 10 and the FD distribution function. Rearranging Eq. 10, we
have:

being C ∗ a constant introduced to play the role of the Fermi energy for the electron
gas [53]. Note that I(t)/P ≤ 1 and, for m = 1 we have exactly the same form of
the FD distribution function f (E, T ) [53], where E and T refer, respectively, to the
energy and temperature. In the present case, C plays a role analogous to the energy
for the Fermi gas, while t is analogous to Boltzmann factor β = 1/kB T , where kB
is Boltzmann constant. Indeed, the time evolution of the Covid-19 spread has a
similar significance than T for the FD distribution function for the Fermi gas. The
behavior of I(t)/P as a function of C/C ∗ is shown in the inset of Fig. 3 b) for several
values of t. Considering that in our fit using Eq. 10 for the spread of Covid-19 in
China [inset of Fig. 3 b)] we have obtained m = 2660.2, it becomes clear that we
are dealing with a distorted version of the FD function where m = 1, cf. Fig. 3 c).
Hence, at some extent, we are faced with a behavior analogous to the distorted FD
distribution for electrons in the picture of Landau Fermi-liquid (FL) [63, 64]. The
latter will be discussed into more details in Section 3. Also, we emphasize that the
ratio I(t)/P gives us the probability of a person being infected in a certain time t in
a similar way that f (E, T ) dictates the probability of a state with energy E being
occupied at a certain temperature T . We anticipate that the spread of Covid-19 for
other countries, not discussed in the present work given the lack of available data,
should follow the same behavior as here discussed for South Korea and China. The

Mello et al.

position of the maximum in the epidemic curve, described by a Gaussian function,
as well as I(t), will be a direct reflex of the policies taken by the health government
agencies by a particular country.
2.5 The logistic and the Fermi-Dirac-like function for the case of fatalities
As reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [66], there
are some risk factors that increase the chance of an infected people to pass away due
to infection by Covid-19. Such factors include mainly being with age above 65 years
old and having a serious underlying medical condition. In our approach, we refer
to this set of factors as a global (Risk) R0 -factor. We assume that the number of
infected people presenting the R0 -factor is CR0 and the number of infected people
without presenting the R0 -factor CW . It is evident that the total number of infected
people CI is given by CI = (CW + CR0 ). Also, it is expected that people presenting
the R0 -factor are more likely to pass away and thus to reduce the total number of
infected people. As discussed in the following, the number of new fatalities per day
follows a Gaussian fitting in the same way as the number of new infection cases
per day. Now, we focus on the number of accumulative fatalities over time. Based
on the fact that the number of accumulative fatalities over time follows a behavior
similar to the number of accumulative infected people over time, we carry out a
similar analysis applied to the number of infected people over time, cf. previously
discussed.
The
i number of people that can pass away in a time interval ∆t is given
h
F −D(t)
d∗ ∆t, where F is the maximum number of fatalities, D(t) the number
by
F
of people that pass away in a certain time t, and d∗ is a parameter associated with
the fatalities rate. Thus, the number of fatalities in a time interval (t + ∆t) minus
the number of fatalities in a time t is proportional to the number of infected people
presenting the R0 -factor. These assumptions enable us to write:
[D(t + ∆t) − D(t)]

where K 0 is a proportionality constant. Thus, following the same elementary mathematical treatment as in the last Subsection, we can write:
D(t) =

m0 e−C 0 t + 1

(16)

where m0 is a non-universal integration constant and C 0 = K 0 d∗ is the fatality
rate. Equation 16 provides a reasonable description of the number of accumulative
fatalities over time and resembles, as stated previously, a distorted Fermi-Dirac-like
distribution function (logistic function), being that for the ideal case m0 = 1. Interestingly, the number of accumulative fatalities over time, described by Eq. 16, also
follows a logistic function in the same way as the number of accumulative infections
over time, cf. Eq. 10. Next, we discuss the fitting of the number of accumulative
fatalities in China employing Eq. 16.
2.6 Data analysis and discussion of the fatalities and the infection capacity
Before starting the discussion regarding the data set for China, aiming to demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we recall the behavior of both the number

Mello et al.

Page 14 of 33

of new fatalities and the total number of fatalities over time for the Ebola outbreak
in West Africa in 2014 [67]. As can be seen in the main panel of Fig. 4, the time
evolution of the number of new fatalities follows a Gaussian function, whereas the
total number (accumulative) of fatalities (inset of Fig. 4) is well-described by Eq. 16.
Such a behavior is also followed by other pandemics (not shown) [68, 69] and thus
reinforcing that we are dealing with an universal description of the epidemic curves
of any disease. Considering the number of new fatalities by Covid-19 for the specific

case of China [Fig. 5 a)], a similar behavior than the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West
Africa (main panel of Fig. 4) is observed. As depicted in Fig. 5 a), the number of new
fatalities over time follows a Gaussian function as well. The total number of fatalities over time [Fig. 5 b)] follows a behavior which resembles the one of a distorted
FD-type function, cf. inset of Fig. 5 b). Interestingly, the value of the parameter
m0 = 51 is much lower than the one for the accumulative number of infections over
time, which is suggestive that the total number of fatalities per day follows a less
distorted FD-like distribution function. Also, under the perspective of condensed

Note that for t → 0, based on previous discussions, C should have its maximum
value. Also note the presence of an additional term in Eq. 18. Such a term emerges
because in the present case the DOS is time dependent, being such a feature key
in understanding the present results. Equation 18 quantifies the infection capacity
by Covid-19 over time. In the main panel of Fig. 5 c), we show Ci versus time

Mello et al.

Page 16 of 33

for China employing the fitting parameters discussed for new infections, cf. Fig. 5
a). A Gaussian function-like behavior is clearly observed. In the case of China,
the infection capacity goes to zero at t ∼ 50 days (dashed vertical line in Fig. 5),
which is in agreement with both the vanishing of new fatalities per day and also
with the saturation of the accumulative number of people which passed away, cf.
Figs. 5 a) and b), respectively. Furthermore, the lowering of Ci , preceded by its
vanishing, is also associated with the saturation of the accumulative number of
infected people, which also takes place at t ∼ 50 days. The inset of Fig. 5 c) depicts
−d[I(t)/P ]/d(C/C ∗ ) versus C/C ∗ . Interestingly, for t → ∞ the number of people
that can be infected is reduced and, consequently the contact (interaction) between
infected and non-infected people is reduced as well. Such a reduction leads to a
behavior closer to an ordinary FD distribution function where no interactions are
present, i.e., we approach a clean Dirac delta function.

3 The Landau Fermi-Liquid picture
Following the discussions presented in the previous section, a similar situation is also
found in a Landau FL electronic system [64]. Upon bringing the quasi-particle (interacting) character to a non-interacting picture, the distorted FD function becomes
a regular FD distribution. In the frame of the Landau FL picture the equilibrium
distribution function of the quasi-particles is given by [64, 65]:
n0p =

1
[e(˜p −µ)/kB T

+ 1]

,

(19)

where ˜p is the quasi-particle local energy and µ the chemical potential. The quantity ˜p depends on the interaction between the quasi-particles fp,p0 and can be
P
written in the form ˜p = p + p0 fp,p0 δnp0 , where p is the energy associated with
the case when the interactions between quasi-particles are absent and δnp0 is the
distribution function of the excited quasi-particles. Thus, np 0 can be rewritten as
follows:
1

n0p =
[e

fp,p0 δnp0 )/kB T ( −µ)/k T

(20)

+ 1]

P

f
0 δn 0 )/k T
where the term e p0 p,p p B can be recognized as the previously discussed
factor m. In the case where fp,p0 = 0 then m = 1, which leads to the case of a
non-interacting Fermi-gas. On the other hand, when fp,p0 6= 0 we have a distorted
Fermi-Dirac distribution function, which corresponds to the case of a Landau FL as
previously discussed. At this point, an analogy can be made between the behavior
of electrons in solids and the interaction between people during an epidemic. In
fact, the interaction between quasi-particles fp,p0 plays a role analogous to the
interaction parameter δε, which quantifies the contact between an infected and a
non-infected person in the modelling of the Covid-19 spread.

4 The logistic function versus SIR model
In the following, we make a comparison between the logistic equation and the SIR
model. Note that Eq. 10 represents the total number of infected people as a function

Mello et al.

Page 17 of 33

of time I(t). In the frame of the SIR model, knowing R0 and D we have access to
both the number of new infections per day I 0 (t) and accumulative total number
R
of infections by calculating I 0 (t)dt. Hence, it is possible to obtain the accumulative total number of infected people in a similar way when employing the logistic
equation. This demonstrates that, although it is appropriate for the description of
epidemics, the SIR model presents a much more complex treatment than the application of the logistic equation, making it easier to determine the epidemic curve by
the latter. It is clear that to make use of Eq. 10 one needs to know the infection rate
and the constant m (∝ t0 ), while the SIR model considers purely epidemiological
factors, such as β 0 and κ. Thus, although simple, the logistical equation depends on
factors that can only be determined after the end of the epidemic in a given place or
region. Besides the use of the logistic function to describe sigmoidal growth curves,
the so-called Gompertz function can also be employed [70]. Essentially, the main
difference between the logistic and the Gompertz function lies on the fact that for
the Gompertz function the growth is more steep and it approaches the asymptote
smoother than in the case of the logistic function. Thus, in the frame of the Covid19 spread, the use of either the logistic or the Gompertz function will depend on
the steepness of the total accumulative number of cases over time, which can be
different for each country. Recently, a predictive model employing the Gompertz
function, moving regression, and a so-called Hidden Markov Model was reported
[71]. In Ref. [71], the authors provide a numerical fitting of the epidemic data for
all countries in order to predict the number of new cases in the next day, discussing
also the disease spread in terms of four stages: the start of the outbreak (lagging),
the initial exponential growth, the deceleration, and the stationary phase. Also, the
authors of Ref. [71] provide a real-time platform to monitor the growth acceleration
of the Covid-19 spread in all countries aiming to measure the effectiveness of the
mobility restrictions on the containment of such a disease.

5 The Cayley tree and the Bethe lattice
As a natural continuation of previous sections, in what follows we present an analysis of the probability of a person being infected with Covid-19 in the frame of
percolation theory. Over the past decades, the percolation theory [13, 72, 73] has
been used to describe the effects of disorder in superconductors [74], in the description of diluted magnetic semiconductors [75], in the analysis of traffic network
[76], and also in epidemiology [77], just to mention a few examples. In condensed
matter Physics, some powerful methods have been used to explore the electronic
structure of systems of interest. Here, the density functional theory (DFT) and
dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) deserve to be mentioned. The latter enables
the investigation of the so-called strongly correlated systems, i.e., systems in which
interactions between electrons are taken into account and, as a consequence, the
emergence of exotic phases. In a crude description, DMFT assumes an atom as an
impurity in a matrix with several electrons under the influence of an effective field
[78]. Such an approximation becomes accurate as the coordination number (z) becomes infinite, i.e., it takes into account infinite nearest neighbors [79, 78, 80, 81].
Within this context, the application of the Bethe lattice is appropriate. Considering

Mello et al.

Page 18 of 33

the application of percolation theory in the field of Solid State Physics, we highlight
here the so-called Bruggemans’s effective medium approximation [82].
x

εa − εef f
εb − εef f
+ (1 − x)
= 0,
εef f + L(εa − εef f )
εef f + L(εb − εef f )

(21)

where x refers to the fraction of one of the phases of interest, εa and εb represent,
respectively, the dielectric constant of the two distinct phases labelled a and b, εef f
is the effective dielectric constant, and L is the so-called shape factor. In the frame
of such an approximation, the goal is to analyse the dielectric responses of the two
coexisting phases. Thus, when one of the phases achieves a critical concentration
(or percolation threshold) one of the phases will dominate the Physics of the system
significantly altering its dielectric response [83]. Here, upon analyzing the spread of
Covid-19 we associate the percolation probability with the probability of a person
being infected in terms of the number of people in and out the quarantine. Figure 7
shows the probability of infection as a function of the number of connections n and
their corresponding association with the blocked and non-blocked paths well-known
in the frame of percolation theory [73].
5.1 Modelling epidemics employing elementary percolation theory
In order to describe the probability of infection by Covid-19 or any other disease,
we make use of elementary concepts in the frame of percolation theory [52], which
determines the probability of percolation to take place in terms of non-blocked
p and blocked (1 − p) connections. The probability of percolation is associated
with the probability of a person being infected with Covid-19 through contact with
an infected person (Fig. 6). A blocked connection represents an infected person
respecting the quarantine and thus “blocking” the spread of the disease. In the same
way, the non-blocked connection refers to an infected person not joining the social
distancing and thus, unfortunately, contributing to the increased of probability of
new people becoming infected. Furthermore, we make use of a simple 3 connections
net to describe the Covid-19 spread, i.e., one infected person can infect two other
people and so on (Fig. 7). Basically, for each number of connections n, we have a total
probability Pn , which includes the percolation and non-percolation probabilities,
cf. Fig. 7. In the simplest case, i.e., n = 1, there are only two possible states, namely
the path is non-blocked p or it is blocked (1 − p). Hence, the total probability in
this case is given by P1 = p + (1 − p) = [p + (1 − p)]1 . For n = 2, there are four
possible states: connection 1 blocked and connection 2 non-blocked, connection 1
non-blocked and connection 2 blocked, connection 1 and 2 blocked, and connection
1 and 2 non-blocked, being the corresponding probabilities for each state given,
respectively, by 2 × (1 − p)p, (1 − p)(1 − p), and p2 . In this case, the total probability
is the sum of the probabilities of each state, given by P2 = 2 × (1 − p)p + (1 −
p)(1 − p) + p2 , which can be rewritten as P2 = [p + (1 − p)]2 . Following such a logic,
the generalized mathematical function of the total probability Pn , i.e., including the
percolative and non-percolative probabilities, in terms of the number of connections
n reads [52]:
Pn = [p + (1 − p)]n = 1.

Figure 6 Schematic representation of the possibilities of infection by Covid-19 based on the
number of connections n. a) For n = 1 there are two possible states E1 and E2 , where E1
represents a blocked path (infected person in quarantine) and E2 a non-blocked path (infected
person not in quarantine), but not in contact with other people. b) For n = 2 there are four
possible states, labelled by E1 , E2 , E3 , and E4 . The interaction between an infected (hand
outlined in red) and non-infected person (hand outlined in black) is represented by a handshake.
Only state E1 represents an actual percolation, i.e., infection since the contact interaction
actually happened. c) For n = 3 one infected person (red color) can infect two others by not
being on quarantine, while in d) the person respected the quarantine and avoided infecting two
other people (represented by the light red color; blue colour indicates non-infected people). For
n = 3, there are 8 combinatory possibilities, but for the sake of compactness we indicate only two
of them. Details in the main text. Figure generated using templates available in Ref. [84].

Note that Pn includes both percolative and non-percolative probabilities, but we
are interested only in the infection (percolative) probability. Thus, we consider only
the terms of Pn that contribute to the percolation probability. Considering n = 3,
for instance, we have:
P3 = p3 + 3(1 − p)p2 + 3(1 − p)2 p + (1 − p)3 = 1.

(23)

However, the percolation probability, labelled here P ∗ , is given only by the terms
P ∗ = (2p2 − p3 ). Essentially, in order to determine the percolation probability, it is
necessary to make a combinatory analysis employing the value of n considering the
probabilities for all possible states En to exist. Then, we rule out all the probabilities
contributions associated with the states presenting null chance of percolation to take
place, making thus the percolation probability as the sum of all the probabilities
of existence of all the remained states. Figure 7 summarizes an extension of such
an analysis for other values of n by considering only the terms associated with the
percolative probability. At this point, we take into account the case for n = 3
and also make a broader analysis considering the so-called Bethe lattice. As can
be inferred from Fig. 7, for n = 3 there is a path leading to two others, being the
consecutive paths originating from each of these two not shown. By taking such
consecutive paths into account, we can form infinite shells leading to the formation

of a Bethe lattice, as shown in Fig. 8. For the sake of completeness, we recall next
the formation of such a lattice based on discussions reported in textbooks, such
as in Ref. [73]. In the initial condition, a central site with a probability p of being
occupied and (1 − p) of being empty leads to an amount of z paths (coordination
number), which also has a site at the end of each path. Thus, we can make a direct
analogy with the Ising-model for integer spin S, where we have S ± 1 configuring
spin up or down, and S = 0 meaning that there is a vacancy in such a site. The
set of sites formed by the central site and the z paths constitute the zeroth shell of
the lattice, cf. indicated in Fig. 8 a). Then, each new site on the boundary of shell
zero gives rise to (z − 1) new paths and sites forming shell number one. This can be
performed continuously to form other shells until, at the end of the lattice, the last
sites have only one path and there is no longer the possibility of forming new shells.
In this context, taking the central site as reference so that we can follow a path from
the central site to a site at the boundary of the final shell, it is necessary that there
are both available paths and occupied sites, configuring a percolation. In this way, it
is possible to consider the percolation probability P ∗ as the probability of obtaining
a path allowing the central site to be connected to a site in the final shell of the
Bethe lattice. In an analogous way, we represent the non-percolation probability as
Q. If each occupied site with probability p leads to (z − 1) paths, we can estimate
an average of (z − 1)p occupied sites. However, having in mind that a site can be
occupied or not, the reduction of available paths at each shell will prevent to reach
the final sites and therefore there is no percolation. Upon going from one shell to
other if (z − 1)p < 1, then the probability of reaching the final shell (percolation)

infect two other more. For the sake of compactness, we stick to only four shells in this
representation of the Bethe lattice, namely the zeroth (n0 = 0, red color), the first (n0 = 1,

is lowered. Such analysis is important because it leads to the so-called percolation
threshold pc =

1
(z−1) .

Employing z = 3, for instance, we focus now on the factors

that may prevent percolation. In this specific case, any site leads to two paths and
each of them with a Q probability of non-percolation. From the standard definitions
of sets and probabilities, two events will be statistically independent if and only if
the intersection between them can be written as a product of both probabilities
[86]. Hence, the probability of non-percolation for (z − 1) will be Q2 . Also, the
sites must be occupied for the percolation to occur, so that the total probability of
non-percolation should be written as Q = (1 − p) + pQ2 . The solutions of the latter
are Q = 1, i.e., there is no percolation, and Q =

(1−p)
p ,

which can be equal to zero

if p = 1 and thus percolation takes place. Analyzing the central site and the three
paths originating from it, the percolation probability must take into account p and
discount the probability of non-percolation, i.e., P ∗ = p − pQ3 . Replacing here the

Mello et al.

Page 22 of 33

previous solutions obtained for Q, we have two different cases. If Q = 1 ⇒ P ∗ = 0,
which represents the non-percolative condition, i.e., p < pc . If Q = (1−p)
p , then:
(

,

(24)

which has a phase transition order parameter-like behavior for the percolation. It
is worth noting that such analysis is distinct for different values of z since it is
dependent on the number of possible paths. Also, note that P ∗ is universal for
z = 3 and does not depend on the length S 0 of the path:
S0 ∝

1
,
p − pc

(25)

which is associated with the size of the lattice [73]. Analyzing the simplest case,
i.e., a chain composed by a set of sites, it is possible to define the pair correlation
function G(r). The latter is associated with the percolation probability between
two occupied reference sites separated by a distance r. Such a distance incorporates
other sites that may be present between the occupied ones. The G(r) function is
given by G(r) = e−r/ξ [73], where ξ is the so-called correlation length ξ = 1/(pc −p).
For p → pc , ξ diverges and the G(r) → 1. In the case of the Covid-19 spread, this
would mean that if the number of non-blocked paths achieves such a threshold,
i.e., a significant portion of the population does not join the social distancing,
then a pronounced increase of the number of new infections over time would take
place. The very same mathematical treatment previously discussed can be employed
upon considering the branches of the Cayley tree as cities, cf. Fig. 8 c). It has been
lately considered the effectiveness of the so-called intermittent quarantine [87]. The
latter means that nearby cities would join the social distancing in pre-programmed
different days. As a consequence, the economic activities can be retaken and with
relatively low probability of spreading the disease between such cities. The main
idea behind lies on the fact that if an infected person is unable to reach one of
the cities [Fig. 8 c)], the probability of a person being infected in that specific city
is lowered, as well as the probability of all subsequent infections that would take
place. In order to discuss the Cayley tree, we have used the concept of a regular tree,
which means that the branches of the tree are constructed always in the same way
employing a fixed z number. However, random trees can also be employed [13, 89],
such as the Erdős-Rényi network, where the construction of such tree is probabilistic
and z is not fixed. In the latter case, crossings between branches can take place.
Furthermore, it is also reported in the literature the so-called pruning process in
random tree [90], where each site, or vertex, is systematically removed over time.
Initially, there are a few branches and over time the tree reaches a plateau, i.e., the
number of branches is minimized and, upon continuing the pruning process, the
tree itself disappears. Bringing this discussion to the case of the Covid-19 spread
through the Cayley tree, we can associate each pruned vertex with either a person
passing away or joining the social distancing [Fig. 8 c)]. As an analogy with the
random tree discussion, upon continuously pruning the tree, such as in the case of
people joining the social distancing or passing away, the epidemic is faded away,

Mello et al.

Page 23 of 33

i.e., the tree vanishes. The effects of the selected quarantine can also be analyzed in
the frame of the SEIR model, which also takes into account the number of people
exposed to the disease. Thus, employing the usual factors for the SEIR model,
the number of connected cities, particular regions, states or even countries and the
number of people circulating from one region to another, it is possible to make a
forecast of the number of new infections [87], cf. Fig. 8 c).
5.2 Switching on the interactions in the Bethe lattice
The Ising-model can be applied to the Bethe lattice [40]. To this end, let us consider
a lattice in which the central site has spin σ0 . The latter has z = m1 neighbors,
m2 next-nearest neighbors, and so on until the last shell n0 which leads to mn0 , i.e.,
n0 -th neighbors. The total number of sites Cn0 on the lattice can be written as [40]:

Sj

(red arrow) σ0 at the central point and other neighbouring spins at sites Si (orange color arrow)
and Sj (green arrow). More details in the main text.

Cn0 = 1 + m1 + m2 + ... + mn0 .

(26)

Furthermore, the number of sites in a network should increase with the number of
shells [73], as follows:
Cn0 = (n0 )d ,

(27)

(29)

that is, for a lattice with infinite shells we also have infinite dimensionality. For
the sake of completeness, we present here a textbook-like discussion of the Isingmodel in the Bethe lattice. Essentially, our goal is to make a connection between the
Bethe lattice and the interaction parameter δε. Before starting, we recall Eq. 4 where
the Hamiltonian H for the Ising-model considering longitudinal applied magnetic
field is defined. The first step to calculate the physical quantities of interest is the
construction of the partition function [40]. The latter represents the sum over all
possible accessible states (Zustandssumme) of the system and reads:
Z=

X

e−βH .

(30)

In a magnetic system, the states are associated with the possible spin orientations.
So, replacing Eq. 4 in 30 we have:
Z=

Considering a particle in a reservoir in which the temperature is fixed and the
particle is in a state ψl with energy El , the number of remaining accessible states is
determined by the multiplicity Ω calculated in terms of the difference between the
total energy Etot and El . Thus, the probability that the particle occupies a state
labelled by ψl can be written as follows [88]:
P (ψl ) = constant × Ω(Etot − El ),

(32)

where constant refers to a normalization constant. The Boltzmann expression for
the entropy, namely S = kB ln[Ω], allows us to calculate the entropy S of a system
as a function of Ω(Etot − El ). Considering that the reservoir is much larger than
the particle itself, i.e., there are many accessible states inside the reservoir, then
Etot >> El . Thus, since El is very small compared to Etot , the entropy difference
S(Etot − El ) can be expanded in a Taylor series [88]:
S(Etot − El ) = S(Etot ) +

and, since T1 = ∂E

(38)

Note that the term e−El /kB T represents only the particular state ψl and, in the
denominator term the sum is over all accessible states. Thus, it is needed to use the
index l0 to differ such terms. Equation 38 can be applied to the Bethe lattice taking
into account the possible Si , Sj states [40]. Hence, we rewrite Eq. 30 as a function
of a non-normalized probability distribution P (S) as:
Z=

X

P (S),

(39)

S

where, by comparison, P (S) is the term of the sum in Eq. 31. This is a reasonable
association, since the non-normalized probability distribution function P (S) can
be written in terms of the multiplicity Ω, which in turn is associated with the
probability that a particle occupies a certain state. Thus, we have:

Now, we focus on the zeroth shell of the Bethe lattice. Equation 31 is valid for a chain
of spins, i.e., a one-dimensional case. However, in order to analyse a bidimensional
case, for instance, the Bethe lattice can be employed. It is necessary to take into
account interaction between the spin at the central point, labelled by σ0 , and the
spins Si at each site of the z paths connected to this central point. As previously
mentioned, for statistically non-correlated events, the total probability will be given

Mello et al.

Page 26 of 33

by the product of the individual probabilities of each event separately. Hence, the
total probability of the system to be at a state S reads [40]:

Equation 41 gives the probability P (S) in terms of the interaction between spin
σ0 at the central point and each of its first neighbors at a site i, cf. sketched in
Fig. 9. Then, all subsequent interactions between the spin at a site i and its nearest
neighbors at a site j are considered, which is represented by the Qn0 [S (j) ] product.
Note that the interaction between Si spins are not taken into account, since such
paths in the Bether lattice are not connected. As discussed in Section 2, Eq. 5
incorporates, when taking into account infected and non-infected people, the δε
interaction, which is equivalent to the magnetic exchange coupling constant J in
the Ising-model. Such an equivalence enables us to calculate the probability P (p) of
a person being infected or not taking into account δε and the interactions between
the person at the central site p0 and its first neighbors pi , as well as the interaction
between a person labelled by pi and its nearest neighbor pj (Fig. 9):

and therefore, P (p) ∝ e−δε . The exponential decay of P (p) in terms of the increase
of the interacting parameter δε means that, upon increasing δε, the probability of
a person being infected is reduced. In other words, an increase of δε reflects on
an increase in the number of infected people, decreasing thus the number of noninfected people that can be infected. Note that, for the case of two infected people
pi = pj = +1/2 or two non-infected people pi = pj = −1/2 interacting with each
other, the sums in Equations 43 and 44 are null. Indeed, such sums are non-zero only
for the case of an interaction between a non-infected person and an infected person
(or vice-versa). Thus, we have the probability of the disease spread in terms of the
interactions δε between neighboring people in a similar way as in the previously
discussed case for the Ising-model on the Bethe lattice.

5.3 The Bethe lattice and the spread of Covid-19
Bringing this whole discussion to the context of the Covid-19 spread, we can associate an occupied site in the Bethe lattice with an infected person and the paths
with the displacement of such people and their possibility of infecting healthy people (Fig. 8). If an infected person travels to the end of a path and finds a healthy
person, that person becomes infected and can go on infecting two more others, for
example. However, if a healthy person remains in quarantine and it is not in the infection path, the site becomes empty reducing the probability of percolation. In the
same way, if an infected person respects the quarantine, the path leading to the contamination is interrupted and the percolation probability is also reduced. It is clear
that upon increasing the number of possible paths the data operations turn into
a complex exercise, preventing thus the resolution of the problem by hand. Hence,
aiming to deal with such a complexity, advanced data analysis techniques are required. This includes, for instance, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods such as the
emcee package, and Machine Learning based algorithms such as the ones presented
in the SciKitLearn package [91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96]. Several tracking methods have
been employed in order to collect big-data sets of millions of internet users aiming
to make a proper mathematical description of a collective behavior, such as epidemic outbreaks. Among such methods, the ARGO (AutoRegression with GOogle
search data) stands out, being applied, for instance, for the case of the influenza
epidemics [97]. Recently, the ARGO method was employed in the case of Covid-19
to make a real-time forecast about the disease spread in small provinces in China
[98]. As discussed previously, the behavior of the percolation probability P ∗ as a
function of p is altered when the number of connections n is increased [Fig. 10]. For
a system presenting a relatively high number of connections n, a percolation probability distribution takes place. This is the case, for instance, of crowded places, as
in the so-called favelas in Brazil, where each person represents a connection n that
may contribute to the increase of the percolation probability distribution, i.e., the
dissemination of the disease. In order to analyze the behavior of such distribution
as a function of p for various values of n, it is natural to employ a distribution
function. Indeed, note that the percolation probability polynomial function (Fig. 7)
can be approximated by:
P ∗ (n, p) =



1
(p − pc )
1
+ arctan n
,
2 π
pc

(45)

where pc refers to the critical value of connections. Equation 45 is also called the
Cauchy distribution function [99]. Equations. 45 and 13 represent a probability distribution, being such mathematical functions asymptotically different so that Eq. 45
cannot be rewritten in the form of Eq. 13 and vice-versa.
5.4 Data analysis and discussion in the frame of the percolation theory
Making use of the adaptation of the percolation theory for the Covid-19 spread
previously discussed, we discuss now the effects on the percolation probability upon
increasing the number of connections n, cf. shown in Fig. 10. Upon comparing, for
instance, the behavior between the percolation probability for n = 2 and 5, we
observe that P ∗ grows more rapidly for higher values of n, indicating that the more

the number of connections n, the faster the percolation probability increases in
terms of the non-blocked paths p. For finite values of n, the percolation probability
is enhanced upon increasing the number of non-blocked paths p, i.e., the probability of people getting infected by Covid-19 increases proportionally to the number
of people not in quarantine. However, when n → ∞ the percolation probability
approaches 1 for p → 1/2, i.e., if people all around the world would interrupt the
social distancing, the probability of people getting infected by Covid-19 would be
enhanced dramatically. In fact, the more people get infected, more and more number
of connections n takes place, decreasing thus the minimal number of non-blocked
paths p (people not respecting the quarantine) for the percolation, i.e., spread of
the disease, to occur. In other words, the probability of people getting infected by
Covid-19 in terms of the people not respecting the quarantine grows faster when the
total number of connections (infections) n is increased. Yet, an interesting analogy
of such percolation probability can be performed. Since the fraction of people in
quarantine and non-infected people is linked to each other, i.e., as one increases the
other decreases so that P ∗ + Q = 1, one can make an analogy with the Physics of
semiconductors and the well-established law of mass action [53]. The latter establishes that the product of the density of electrons and holes at a certain temperature
is constant and it also depends on the product of their corresponding masses. In

Mello et al.

Page 29 of 33

other words, the amount of electrons promoted from the valence to the conduction
band is equal to the number of remaining holes in the valence band. As an analogy,
p and (1 − p) can be interpreted in the same way since any increase (decrease) in p
implies a decrease (increase) in exactly the same proportion in (1 − p).

6 What’s next?
Besides the need of a more appropriate mathematical approach in order to describe
properly the epidemic curves of a particular disease, there are other inherent factors of our society that can be developed in order to minimize the social impact of
other epidemics in the future. These include the record and divulgation of reliable
data sets in the frame of epidemics by health agencies in order to avoid or properly
brake the outbreak of a disease. The development and design of mobile apps [45]
can serve as an important tool to be employed in a more efficient social distancing. Such mobile apps can indeed be very useful in the management of the disease
spread. However, their use collide with ethical aspects regarding the control of each
individual’s information and locations by the government, which in many cases can
preclude the application of such apps. As pointed out in Ref. [100], the record of the
epidemic data must be performed and analyzed together with other relevant data
sources, such as demographic, genetic, and travel patterns for the various locations
and temporal scales aiming the prevention and the containment of epidemics. Furthermore, it is highly required that the health agencies make a proper planning
about the construction of hospital beds in the case of an epidemic, being obviously
evident that the construction speed of such hospital beds in different countries will
be distinct, impacting thus on the treatment of infected people. Even though the
coronavirus was already known by the scientific community a few years ago [101]
the outbreak of the disease could not be avoided. Hence, it becomes clear that the
discovery of a new virus should be accompanied, if possible, by the discovery of the
antidotes and or vaccines. This points to the urge of high-level scientific research
focussed on the prevention or management of future viral epidemics. Also, the incorporation of discussions on the risk and possible consequences of epidemics in the
curriculum of primary and high schools may play an important role on the resulting
awareness of younger people regarding profilatic measurements which could, indeed,
reduce the impact of future epidemics.

7 Conclusions
We have reviewed the key-related aspects to the SIR model for various epidemics
and provided a brief discussion about its mathematical description. An adaptation
of a S = 1/2 Ising-like model was presented and we deduced the logistic function, usually employed to describe epidemic curves among other phenomena. We
have shown that the temporal evolution of the number of infections and fatalities,
described by the logistic function, has some resemblance with a distorted FermiDirac-like distribution function found in the celebrated Landau Fermi-liquid theory.
Our analysis demonstrated that a Gaussian-type function suffices to describe the
epidemic curves and that the quarantine plays a crucial role in the amendment of
Covid-19 spread. The fundamental concepts of the Cayley tree and the Bethe lattice were discussed and a connection with the Ising-model was made. Yet, we have

demonstrated that the percolation (infection) probability in terms of the number of
people not respecting the social distancing sets in more rapidly when the total number of cases is increased, making thus evident the importance of the quarantine in
the suppression of Covid-19 spread. We hope that the governmental health agencies
can have benefits from it. The present work is, at some extent, an appeal to world
leaderships to adopt the social distancing to brake the spread of Covid-19 before a
vaccine is discovered and released. Such social distancing is crucial since there are
possible sub-notifications of the number of new infection cases that could mask an
even worse scenario of the number of infections. Our appeal is relevant in the attempt to prevent a second wave or even small outbreaks of the number of infections.
This is particularly true in countries, such as, for instance, India and some African
countries, for which the epidemic curve is still ascending up to date. The mass media
plays an important role regarding the dissemination of reliable information aiming
to properly aware the population, which can also be considered, in some cases, as
an external factor that can indirectly influence the shape of the epidemic curves.
Furthermore, we have reviewed the basics of percolation theory and employed it to
describe the Covid-19 spread. The analytic solutions for the mathematical models,
presented here, can serve as a basis for more complex cases involving numerical
calculations. We have provided several distinct paths that can be employed to describe the epidemic curves for any disease. Such elementary discussions presented
here can be useful in the application to other collective phenomena. As discussed
by the authors of Ref. [102], it is not straightforward to make a forecast of the
epidemic curves since the variables associated with the epidemic might change over
time. Indeed, as pointed out in Ref. [103], the outbreak of epidemics should be faced
treated in a much broader context. The knowledge from various other research areas, besides epidemiology, can play a crucial role in a deeper discussion about the
epidemics prevention, such as logistics and crisis management [103]. The defiance
of the twenty-first century, e.g., poverty, climate change, and urbanization significantly contribute to epidemics to happen more likely [103]. Also, it is crucial to
learn from the negative outcomes of past epidemics, such as the Ebola outbreak
in Congo [104], aiming to prevent other possible future epidemics. Furthermore,
several countries in the world are experiencing the epidemic scenario for the first
time, being difficult for such countries to properly manage the situation. Thus, a
more embracing and modern approach on the containment of epidemics must be
developed. Also, it is mandatory the inclusion of strategic plans in future public
health governmental policies. Last but not least, this work was written during our
period of quarantine.
