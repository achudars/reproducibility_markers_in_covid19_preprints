Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has proved to be one of the most disruptive public health emergencies in recent memory. Among non-pharmaceutical interventions, social distancing and lockdown measures are some of the most
common tools employed by governments around the world to combat the
disease. While mathematical models of COVID-19 are ubiquitous, few
have leveraged network theory in a general way to explain the mechanics
of social distancing. In this paper, we build on existing network models for
heterogeneous, clustered networks with random link activation/deletion
dynamics to put forth realistic mechanisms of social distancing using piecewise constant activation/deletion rates. We find our models are capable of
rich qualitative behavior, and offer meaningful insight with relatively few
intervention parameters. In particular, we find that the severity of social
distancing interventions and when they begin have more impact than how
long it takes for the interventions to take full effect.

Introduction

The global COVID-19 pandemic has upended modern life an placed an enormous epidemiological, economic, and social burden on the world’s resources.
The gravity of events has brought the need for epidemiological modeling into
sharp focus. As the pandemic spread around the world in the absence of a
vaccine, non-pharmaceutical interventions including social distancing, quarantine, and lockdown measures proliferated, and bringing these interventions
into modeling efforts has remained paramount.
In recent years, network-based models of epidemic spread have become an
increasingly popular paradigm (Pastor-Satorras et al, 2015; Kiss et al, 2017), and

network science generally has been recognized for its potential to contribute
solutions to the current crisis (Eubank et al, 2020). Most network models represent individuals as nodes in a network, and their contacts as edges connecting
the nodes. Moreover, many models assume that the network is static–that the
edges between nodes don’t change over time–and thus the epidemic spreads
from node to node across these edges. Among static network models, pairwise
models (Keeling, 1999; Eames and Keeling, 2002) are both frequently used and
well-studied. Pairwise models track not only the number of nodes in a given
state, but pairs, triples, and higher order motifs as well (Fig. 1). An advantage
of pairwise models in that in their full form, they exactly model (in expectation) the continuous time Markov chain formulation of epidemic spread on a
network (Taylor et al, 2012).
Pairwise models have been successfully applied to a number of disease natural histories and different network types. Two important network features
that play a role in the theory of pairwise models are degree heterogeneity and
clustering. The degree of a node in a network is the number of edges to which
it is connected, and the degree distribution is the probability distribution of
selecting a random node with a given degree. The degree distribution plays a
fundamental role in many network models, and is particularly powerful when
described as a probability generating function. The clustering coefficient is
the ratio of triangles to connected triples in the network. While clustering in
an important component of network structure, it has not widely been incorporated to pairwise models. We acknowledge two major benefits of degree
heterogeneous, clustered models. First, including both or either as modeling
consideration affects epidemic dynamics in a nontrivial way (House and Keeling, 2011; Keeling, 1999) and second, both have been shown to be features of
realistic contact networks (Read et al, 2008).

Though static networks model some forms of complexity well, an important aspect of real-world contact networks is that some connections change
in response to disease dynamics or public health measures. By relaxing the
static network assumption, dynamic or “adaptive” network models (Gross and
Sayama, 2009) can capture both the dynamics of the network and the epi2

demic dynamics on the network. A number of models have been recently
proposed for that describe a variety of network dynamic processes. Gross
et al (2006) introduced a model of edge rewiring, where susceptible individuals break connections with infectious individuals and reconnect to susceptible individuals at random. Another model for network dynamics is random
link addition/deletion (Kiss et al, 2012) where individuals break and form new
contacts and constant rates. Their approach is notable for its intuitiveness as a
simple dynamic model, and also its use of probability generating functions as a
tool to describe network dynamics. A related model is link addition/deletion
on a fixed network (Tunc et al, 2013; Shkarayev et al, 2014), where individuals can temporarily deactivate contacts with infectious individuals, and reactivate them when their contact is not infectious. While much of the focus of the
adaptive network literature has been involved in analyzing the resulting dynamical systems, particularly for SIS-type diseases, some works have focused
on the role of network dynamics in controlling or mitigating epidemic spread
(Youssef and Scoglio, 2013; Sélley et al, 2015).
Network models in general offer a compromise between two other common modeling techniques: compartment models and agent-based simulations.
They are able to capture more complex contact structure than simple compartment models, while offering analytical tractability that many agent-based
simulations lack. Despite this, models of non-pharmaceutical interventions
have tended to favor simulation or compartment models (Ahmed et al, 2018;
Davey et al, 2008). In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, complex
individual-based simulations offered major insights about the effectiveness of
non-pharmaceutical interventions (Ferguson et al, 2020). However, the high
computational cost can make investigating the impacts of intervention policies
with a large number of parameters a challenging endeavor. Network models,
especially those with a relatively small number of equations, can offer broad
insights at reduced cost. While some models of social distancing have incorporated contact network structure as a major consideration (Valdez et al,
2012; Glass et al, 2006), differential equation network models of such interventions are uncommon. Adaptive network models in particular can offer a
new perspective on questions surrounding social distancing and other nonpharmaceutical interventions made pressing by the COVID-19 pandemic.
In this paper, we develop simple, novel mechanisms to incorporate social distancing into a network model of epidemic spread, using COVID-19 as
the central case study to investigate the impact of a range of interventions.
First, we develop a pairwise SEIR model with random link activation/deletion
dynamics–that is edges are added and deleted at constant rates independent
of the epidemic dynamics on the network. Furthermore, the model incorporates degree heterogeneity and clustering, which offers increased realism over
simpler network or compartment models. To apply the model, we use bipartite mixing networks to generate large heterogeneous, clustered contact networks coupled with disease dynamics given by epidemiological parameters
estimated for COVID-19. Next, we develop two mechanisms of social distancing using piecewise constant link activation and deletion rates. The first is a
3

single intervention event, where the average number of contacts decreases, is
held constant, and then recovers; the second allows for multiple interventions
which restart depending on the prevalence of the disease. While we investigate
the implications of these policies for COVID-19 on a specific type of heterogeneous, clustered network, both the adaptive network model and the social
distancing schemes are more generally applicable to a variety of networks and
epidemiological parameters. Finally, we consider the public health implications of the latter model, finding that certain intervention parameters are more
important than others in achieving an effective reduction in overall infections.

Model

To begin construction of the full model, we consider SEIR dynamics on a static
network. Pairwise equations for an SEIR epidemic can be found in Keeling
et al (1997) and Rand (1999). Model variables include the expected number
of susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered nodes ([S], [E], [I] and [R]
respectively) as well as the expected number of pairs in each state. For example, [SS] is the expected number of connected pairs of susceptible nodes,
while [SI] is the expected number of connected pairs of susceptible and infectious nodes. The expected number of connected triples is also considered
([SSI], [ESI], [ISI]), though differential equations for these variables are not
written. The full SEIR pairwise model is
˙ = −β[SI],
[S]
˙ = β[SI] − η[E],
[E]

˙ = η[E] − γ[I],
[I]
˙ = −2β[SSI],
[SS]

˙ = β[SSI] − β[ESI] − η[SE],
[SE]
˙ = η[SE] − β[SI] − β[ISI] − γ[SI],
[SI]

(5)

˙ = 2β[ESI] − 2η[EE],
[EE]
˙ = β[ISI] + β[SI] + η[EE] − (γ + η)[EI],
[EI]

(7)

(4)

˙ = 2η[EI] − 2γ[II],
[II]

(6)
(8)
(9)

where β is the transmission rate, γ is the recovery rate, and η is the rate at
which exposed individuals become infectious. The nodes and edges also obey
conservation equations
N = [S] + [E] + [I] + [R]

(10)

and
hkiN = [SS] + [EE] + [II] + [RR]
+ 2 ([SE] + [SI] + [SR] + [EI] + [ER] + [IR])
4

(11)

where N is the number of nodes and hki is the average degree of the network.
We note that with the conservation equations, we do not need terms of the type
[AR] to determine the evolution of [S], [E], [I], and [R].
The full model requires dynamical equations for triples of the form [ASI]
and higher order motifs as well, leading to a system that is prohibitively large
for computations. To make the model tractable, we approximate the expected
number of triples [ASI] in terms of pairs and individual nodes, thus closing the
system (1)-(9). An approximation of this kind is referred to as a triple closure.
For triples of the type A − S − I, House and Keeling (2011) give a triple closure
approximation as

( k k[Sk ])
where [Ak ] is the expected number of nodes in state A with degree k. Using
the network degree distribution probability generating function and introducing new dynamical variables, they develop an SIR model for heterogeneous,
clustered networks. In Appendix A, we derive an analogous heterogeneous,
clustered SEIR model complete with link activation and deletion. However,
the model complexity induced by (12) is not necessary to accurately capture
the combined epidemic and network dynamics, and thus a simpler triple closure will suffice.
A simple yet useful assumption is that degree and state are independent,
and thus [Ak ] = pk [A] where pk is the proportion of nodes with degree k. With
this assumption, the resulting triple closure becomes:

homogeneous degree distribution is assumed, the closure reduces to clustered
closure from Keeling (1999).
With the static model closed, we now incorporate the effects of network
dynamics. Kiss et al (2012) introduced a simple model of network dynamics,
termed random link activation/deletion (RLAD). In this model, independent
of epidemic dynamics nonexistent edges are added to the network (or activated) at a constant rate α and existing edges are removed from the network
(or deleted) at a constant rate ω. Ignoring epidemic spread and looking at the
effects of activation/deletion only, the equation for edges of type [AA] is
˙ = α ([A]([A] − 1) − [AA]) − ω[AA]
[AA]

(14)

and for type [AB] we have
˙ = α ([A][B] − [AB]) − ω[AB].
[AB]

(15)

Next, we have to consider the effect of activation/deletion on the now timedependent network quantities: degree distribution moment terms hki(t), hk 2 −

ki(t) and the clustering coefficient φ(t). Following the example of Kiss et al
(2012), dynamical equations for the first two can be easily derived by finding
the partial differential equation for the degree distribution generating function

The Kolmogorov equations describe the evolution of pk (t), the proportion of
degree k nodes at time t :
p˙k = α (N − k) pk−1 − (α(N − 1 − k) + ωk) pk + ω(k + 1)pk+1 .

(17)

With some straightforward algebra, we derive a partial differential equation
for the degree distribution generating function:

The network quantities hki and hk 2 − ki can be computed from the generating
function as hki = gx (1, t) and hk 2 − ki = gxx (1, t). Then, from (18) we derive
the dynamical equations:

˙ ki = 2α(N − 2)hki − 2(α + ω)hk 2 − ki.

(19)

The clustering coefficient is defined as the ratio of triangles to connected triples
in the network. To compute φ̇, we start with the Kolmogorov equations for
qk (t), the probability that there are k triangles in the network at time t :
q˙k = α(L − 3(k − 1))qk−1 − (α(L − 3k) + 3ωk)qk + 3ω(k + 1)qk+1

(21)

where L = N hk 2 −ki/2 is the number of connected triples. From this we derive
the differential equation for the expected number of triangles hT i as
hṪ i = αL − 3(α + ω)hT i,
and compute the equation for the clustering coefficient φ(t) :

To demonstrate the validity of this model, we test it against numerical simulations (Fig. 2) on a heterogeneous, clustered network—the construction of
which is described in Section 2.1. Clearly, the model (24)-(35) is in excellent
agreement with the simulations.

2.1

Network and Epidemiological Parameters

The goal of this paper is to investigate social distancing policies through random link activation/deletion dynamics, which are controlled by the activation
and deletion rates α and ω. Moreover, in building intervention schemes in Section 3 new parameters are introduced. In order to consistently compare the
efficacy of intervention schemes, network and epidemiological parameters are
held the same across schemes. As such, we restrict our attention to a particular heterogeneous, clustered network and epidemiological parameters that are
plausible for COVID-19. For completeness, other network types and epidemiological parameters are considered in the Appendix B.

[I]0 = 10, [S]0 = N − 20, [R]0 = 0. Epidemiological and network parameters
are R0 = 2.4, η = 1/5, γ = 1/10, α ≈ 2.3 × 10−5 , ω = 3.4 × 10−5 . Individual

A consistent challenge of network models is constructing realistic contact
networks. In particular, degree heterogeneity and significant clustering are observed in real world social networks (Read et al, 2008). To construct such a contact network, we consider a bipartite mixing network (Eubank et al, 2004) with
N individuals and M mixing locations (Fig. 3a). Two individuals are in contact
if they both connect to the same mixing location, so we form a contact network
as the unipartite projection of the bipartite mixing network (Fig. 3b). To introduce degree heterogeneity, we construct a bipartite mixing network where
both individuals and mixing locations have Poisson degree distributions. The
average individual degree λ and average mixing location degree µ are related
by
N λ = M µ,
(39)
so only N, M, and λ are needed to characterize this network. Using generating
function techniques (Newman et al, 2001), we compute

(Fig. 3c) and clustering. Unless otherwise specified, the networks in this article
are generated using N = 10, 000, M = 2, 500, and λ = 4. We acknowledge
that though we use a bipartite mixing network to generate a heterogeneous,
clustered unipartite contact network, our network dynamics are limited to the
contact network. Mobility networks (Chang et al, 2021) have been used to great
effect for COVID-19, and suggest a fruitful path forward for bipartite network
dynamics.
Numerous recent studies have estimated important epidemiological quantities for the spread of Sars-CoV-2, including the length of the incubation period, the length of the infectious period, and the basic reproduction number
R0 . We choose the plausible estimates in line with recent studies: average
incubation period of 5 days (Linton et al, 2020; Zhang et al, 2020), average
infectious period of 10 days (You et al, 2020), and R0 = 2.4 (Li et al, 2020;
Anastassopoulou et al, 2020). To incorporate these into the model, we note that
1/η and 1/γ are the average lengths of the incubation and infectious periods
respectively, and thus η = 0.2, γ = 0.1. We do not derive R0 for the model (24)(35), but instead consider the basic reproduction number for a heterogeneous,
clustered population from Miller (2009), which is given as the series

Ignoring higher order terms, we can compute β from (43) when R0 = 2.5 With
these parameters, we plausibly model the spread of COVID-19 through a moderately sized heterogeneous, clustered population in the following sections,
while introducing various social distancing interventions to mitigate or control the epidemic.

Analysis

Social distancing and lockdown measures have been used to curb the spread
of infectious diseases throughout history, and are some of the most ubiquitous
non-pharmaceutical interventions in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Many
compartment-based models that incorporate social distancing do so in a phenomenological manner through the transmission rate, but adaptive network
models present an opportunity to describe a social distancing mechanism in

a fundamental way. A simple model of such interventions can be naturally
characterized by the link activation/deletion process. During periods of social
distancing and lockdown, individual contacts break; during periods of relaxation of the measures, individual contacts form. In this section, we develop two
social distancing schemes (Fig. 4). Both social distancing schemes begin when
the prevalence [I](t) reaches some specified threshold level. For the simple
intervention scheme, contacts break as the intervention is implemented, then
contacts stay fixed as the intervention is in place, and finally contacts form until
they reach their pre-intervention levels. The prevalence-dependent scheme unfolds similarly, but with two notable differences. First, after the intervention,
contacts do not start forming again until the prevalence has dropped below
the threshold. Second, any time the prevalence reaches the threshold again,
the intervention restarts. This allows for multiple implementations of a social
distancing intervention throughout the course of the epidemic.
Critically, we do not treat these schemes as a mere modeling exercise, but
are interested in the impact of each intervention scheme at the end of the epidemic. We develop two simple metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the
simple and prevalence-dependent interventions. First, we consider each intervention’s ability to reduce the cumulative number of infections, known as the
final size of the epidemic. Second, we also consider how many infections occur above the threshold value for prevalence. These two measures reflect two
different yet crucial public health goals, and do not necessarily agree on which
interventions are the most effective. Both must be considered to get a complete
11

picture of an intervention’s impact. In this section, we derive these two metrics
mathematically, and describe the simple and prevalence-dependent interventions while assessing their overall effects.

3.1

Evaluation Metrics

The first measure of intervention effectiveness we introduce is the Relative Change
in the Final Size (RCFS). The final size of an epidemic is the cumulative number
of infections that occur over the course of the epidemic. In terms of the model,
the final size can be found as the limiting value of the recovered individuals
[R]:
lim [R](t) = R∞ .
t→∞

We compare the final size of the epidemic with no intervention R∞ to the fiint
. We then define the
nal size where an intervention has been implemented R∞
RCFS as
Rint − R∞
.
(44)
RCFS = ∞
R∞
An effective intervention will lead to a decrease in final size, so an RCFS near 0
is unsuccessful, while an RCFS near −1 is extraordinarily successful. However,
it is important to note that for brief, intense intervention schemes, it is possible that the final size actually increases. In this case, the network parameters
change quickly, before significant disease spread, so the epidemic unfolds on a
fundamentally different static network.
While the relative change in the final size provides an overall measure of the
effectiveness of interventions, reducing cumulative infections alone is not the
only public health goal that an intervention scheme might seek to accomplish.
In some schemes, a large number of infections occur above the threshold despite a large reduction in the final size of the epidemic. This can be particularly
pernicious if the threshold represents some fixed resource such as healthcare
capacity, where a large number of infections above the threshold could lead to
higher mortality and other negative outcomes. To account for this, we compute
the Cumulative Infections Above Threshold (CIAT). Let t1 , t2 , ... be the sequence of
˙ 6= 0 at any time in the sequence, the contitimes when [I] = qN. Assuming [I]
nuity of [I](t) implies that the prevalence is above the threshold on the intervals
[t2i−1 , t2i ] for i = 1, 2, 3, ... Thus, the CIAT may be defined as
CIAT =

XZ
i

t2i

[I](t) − qN dt.

(45)

t2i−1

We note that the units of CIAT are person-time–for a metric with units of population, we compute the Average Infections Above Threshold (AIAT):
AIAT = P

CIAT
i t2i − t2i−1

(47)

which is convenient for computations.

3.2

Simple Intervention

For a simple model of social distancing, we consider a scheme that unfolds
in three successive phases, each with variable length. The effects of the intervention scheme on the contact network are characterized through the average
number of contacts hki(t). The intensity of the intervention can be thought of
as how severely the average number of contacts are reduced, so we introduce a
severity parameter p ∈ [0, 1). The top panel of Fig. 5 shows how the hki changes

Figure 5: Simple Intervention. Once the intervention begins, edges are deleted
at rate ω ∗ for LI days until the average number of contacts hki drops to phki0 .
For the next LH days, no changes are made to the nework. Then, edges are
added at rate α∗ for LR days, until the average number of contacts hki increases
to back to hki0
over time as the result of the intervention. In the first phase, as social distancing measures are put into place, the average number of contacts decreases from
its pre-intervention level hki0 to phki0 . In the second phase, with the measures
fully in place, the average number of contacts remains constant at phki. In the
13

third phase, social distancing measures are relaxed and the average number of
contacts increases to its pre-intervention level hki0 .
To achieve this effect in the evolution of the average number of contacts,
we consider link activation rate α(t) and deletion rate ω(t) functions that are
piecewise constant. These rate functions can be seen in the bottom two panels
of Fig. 5. Since contacts are only broken in the first phase, ω(t) = ω ∗ in the
first phase and 0 otherwise. Since contacts are only formed in the third phase,
α(t) = α∗ in the third phase and 0 otherwise. As the dynamical equation for hki
(33) is a first-order linear ODE, the resulting curve for hki(t) will be piecewise
exponential, and the values of α∗ and ω ∗ are easily computed for a given p.
Other than p, four other parameters characterize the simple intervention: the
lengths of the three phases LI , LH , and LR , and the threshold proportion of the
population q ∈ [0, 1) to initiate the intervention. The full simple intervention
scheme can be described as follows:
• No intervention: the epidemic spreads unabated until [I] increases through
qN (α = ω = 0).
• Intervention Phase (length LI ): intervention occurs, edges are removed
at a constant rate (α = 0, ω = ω ∗ ).
• Holding Phase (length LH ): intervention holds, edges are neither removed nor added (α = ω = 0).
• Relaxation Phase (length LR ): interventions are relaxed, edges are added
at a constant rate (α = α∗ , ω = 0).
As this scheme requires five “intervention” parameters, p, q, LI , LH , and LR ,
exploring the full impact of the interventions is difficult. To better see the effects, we consider an example scheme where we fix two parameter values in
each and allow the other three to vary. To focus on the impact of the severity
parameter p and the lengths of the intervention and relaxation phases LI and
LR , we set LH = 15 and q = 0.01 for the remainder of this section. Thus,
the intervention begins when infections reach one percent of the population,
and the holding phase is fixed at 15 days for all interventions. The other three
parameters are allowed to vary. This allows for both abrupt and gradual implementations of interventions and relaxation of measures, and different levels
of intervention intensity. Fig. 6 shows the prevalence of some example intervention schemes, showing rich qualitative behavior. To assess the effectiveness
of the simple intervention we plot the RCFS and the AIAT for a large number
of parameter combinations. We allow the lengths of both the intervention and
relaxation periods LI and LR to vary from 2 to 180 days, and consider three
different intensities p = 0.125, 0.25, 0.5. The results are shown in Fig. 7.
A significant common feature of the plots in Fig. 7a is a qualitative boundary (solid white) that divides (LI , LR ) space into two distinct classes of the
resulting infection curve (for p = 0.125, this occurs outside the boundaries of
the plot). To the right of the boundary, infection curves are characterized by a

single “uniform spike,” defined by an prevalence curve [I](t) with two inflection points and a single local maximum (Fig. 8a). To the left of the boundary,
infection curves take the form of either a single “non-uniform spike” (Fig. 8b),
with more than two inflection points but only one local maximum, or multiple
spikes (Fig. 8c), with more than two inflection points and multiple local maxima. For p = 0.125 and p = 0.25, only multiple spikes occur to the left of the
boundary. For small LI , the first spike is small and the second spike is large,
and occasionally the final size of the epidemic surpasses the static case due to
network alterations. As LI approaches the qualitative boundary, the second
spike becomes shorter and occurs later until negligible. This phenomenon can
also be seen in Fig. 7b: as LI increases, the AIAT decreases until the second
spike drops below the threshold qN, at which point the AIAT increases as the
first spike grows taller. For p = 0.5 on the other hand, both nonuniform spikes
and multiple spikes are possible to the left of the boundary. Multiple spikes occur in the region of (LI , LR ) space enclosed by the dashed white curve, while
a single nonuniform spike occurs elsewhere left of the qualitative boundary.
A few other observations warrant comment. First, the length of the intervention LI appears to be more important in determining epidemic’s final
size compared to LR . This is intuitive, as the most significant changes to network structure occur during the intervention phase. Second, as p increases,
the qualitative boundary shifts generally left. This means that for less severe
interventions, single uniform spikes will occur for smaller LI values. This observation carries weight for repeated interventions, explored in Section 3.3, as
single uniform spikes are heavily penalized by the AIAT. Third, nonuniform
spikes occur for p = 0.5, but not for p = 0.125 or p = 0.25. We hypothesize that
there may exist some threshold p∗ where nonuniform spikes don’t occur below
p∗ , but do above p∗ .

Prevalence-Dependent Intervention

While the simple intervention scheme provides a simple yet general model of
social distancing, its implementation lacks a degree of realism. Interventions
are put into place only once, and the epidemic continues, often with infections
spiking after measures begin to relax. In reality, we would expect public health
measures to be responsive to rising prevalence. Moreover, continued interventions might be triggered by some indicator, such as case numbers, deaths,
hospital capacity, etc... In this section, we adapt the intervention scheme from
Section 3.2 so that it may be reimplemented when a prevalence-based condition is satisfied, forming the prevalence-dependent intervention. We begin

Figure 9: Prevalence-Dependent Intervention. The intervention begins when
[I] = qN, and edges are deleted at a constant rate ω ∗ until hki decreases to
phki0 , at which point there is no change to the network until [I] drops below the
threshold qN. Then, edges are added at a constant rate α∗ until hki returns to
hki0 or [I] increases through the threshold qN , at which point the intervention
begins again.
with two more realistic assumptions about how a public health response might
unfold. First, interventions are reimplemented any time the prevalence increases through some threshold. Second, the relaxation phase of an intervention doesn’t begin until the prevalence has dropped below the threshold. We
incorporate these assumptions into a new prevalence-dependent intervention
scheme. The scheme is determined by four parameters: q, p, LI , and LR . As
before, interventions begin when [I] reaches qN , p is the severity of the inter17

vention, and LI and LR are now the maximum lengths of the intervention and
relaxation periods, which determine ω ∗ and α∗ as in Section 3.2. We can define
the new scheme as follows:
• As [I] increases through qN, a new intervention is implemented.
• Intervention Phase: Once an intervention is implemented, edges are deleted
at rate ω = ω ∗ until hki = phki0 .
• Holding Phase: At the end of the intervention period, a holding period
begins (α = ω = 0) until the prevalence has dropped below the threshold
qN. If the prevalence drops below the threshold during the intervention
period, the holding period has length 0.
• Relaxation Phase: Edges are added at rate α = α∗ until hki = hki0 , or a
new intervention is implemented.
It worth noting that compared to the simple intervention in Section 3.2, the intervention, holding, and relaxation phases can all be of variable length. For instance, if the average number of contacts hki has not rebounded to hki0 by the
time a new implementation begins, the resulting relaxation period is shorter
than LR . Moreover, in the subsequent intervention phase, edges delete until
hki = phki0 and the phase is shorter than LI . In sum, while ω ∗ and α∗ are
fixed, the average number of contacts is never less than phki0 and the effective
lengths of different intervention and relaxation phases may vary. An example implementation of the prevalence-dependent scheme is shown in Fig. 9,
which shows both holding periods of nonzero length as well as intervention
and relaxation periods that are shorter than LI and LR respectively.

intervention. Each plot represents a choice of p and q, with LI and LR on the
axes, ranging from 2 for 180.
A notable feature of the prevalence-dependent intervention is its ability to
generate infection curves with multiple spikes as the epidemic progresses. Examples of this behavior are shown in Fig. 10. To fully explore the intervention,
we again consider the RCFS for a variety of parameter combinations. Fig. 11
shows the RCFS for different thresholds (q = 0.005, 0.01, 0.02) and intensities
(p = 0.125, 0.25, 0.5) as LI and LR both vary from 2 to 180 days. Though not
shown, as with the simple intervention each case has a qualitative boundary, to
the right of which infection curves are single, uniform spikes. The most significant departure from the simple intervention though is to the left of the qualitative boundary. In the simple case, infection curves from this region took the
form of either two spikes or a single nonuniform spike. With the prevalencedependent intervention, the infection curve behavior is richer.
The region is characterized by “waves” in the RCFS, particularly for lower
values of p. The boundaries of these waves can be described by the number
of spikes that occur over the course of the epidemic. Holding LR fixed and
increasing LI through one of these contours helps explain the behavior of the
infection curve in this region (Fig. 12). At the crest, the final spike peaks just

the shrinking of the final spike and the penultimate spike dropping below the

below the threshold qN (Fig. 12a). As LI increases, the final spike occurs later
and peaks lower (Fig. 12b) and the RCFS decreases until the spike vanishes.
Then, the penultimate spike becomes the new final spike, peaking just below
the threshold (Fig. 12c) and the RCFS jumps up as a new wave crests. This
underscores a potential limitation of a threshold-based intervention: if a spike
does not reach the threshold and no intervention occurs, the spike occurs over
a longer period of time and more infections accumulate than if the spike had
triggered an intervention. A practical implication of this observation is that
no spike in infections should go unaddressed by interventions if the goal is to
reduce the number of cumulative infections. We also consider the AIAT for the
same parameter combinations (Fig. 13), though the conclusions by this metric
are less complex. For any combination of p and q, increasing LI leads to a larger
AIAT. This suggests that when considering interventions with the same RCFS,
more abrupt interventions (smaller LI ) are preferable. However, an interesting
observation is that the AIAT increases rapidly as the epidemic changes from
three to two spikes.
While Figs. 11 and 13 show the overall behavior of the prevalence-dependent
intervention, by considering fixed values of LI and LR and allowing p and q
to vary, we get a more pointed perspective on the effectiveness of this type
of intervention. Fig. 14 shows increasingly gradual interventions from left to
right with plots of the RCFS and AIAT as p and q vary on the axes. Notably,
regardless of LI , low values of p and q are able to produce interventions that
both greatly decrease the final size of the epidemic, and the average infections
above threshold. This suggests that for sufficiently low thresholds (q) and sufficiently severe decreases in contacts (p), the length over which the decrease
in contacts occurs (LI ) does not play an important role in the effectiveness of
interventions. However, as q or p increases, LI has a more pronounced impact.

20

Figure 13: Average infections above threshold (AIAT) for the prevalencedependent intervention. Each plot represents a choice of p and q, with LI and
LR on the axes, ranging from 2 for 180.
In particular, for low values of p and large values of q, a longer, more gradual
intervention can lead to more average infections above threshold. Moreover, a
stark change in both effectiveness metrics occurs for large values of p, (around
p = 0.5 for LI = 15 and LI = 30). This suggests that if an intervention doesn’t
reduce average contacts sufficiently, a highly effective intervention isn’t possible, regardless of the other parameter values.

Discussion

In this paper, we have developed a new SEIR model on a network with random link activation/deletion dynamics. Using piecewise constant activation
and deletion rate functions, we propose two simple mechanisms for social distancing interventions. The simple intervention models a single intervention
event, where contacts are decreased over a period of time, stay constant, and
then return to pre-intervention levels. The prevalence-dependent intervention
expands the simple case to more complex scenarios, where interventions can

be reintroduced in the face of rising prevalence. Using the unipartite projection of a bipartite network, and epidemiological parameters representative of
COVID-19, we examine the effectiveness of a wide range of potential social
distancing policies on relatively large heterogeneous, clustered networks.
Both intervention schemes are shown to capture a wide variety of behaviors
in the prevalence “curve,” which has received considerable attention in both
academic studies and public health messaging. The simple intervention manifests curves with one or two spikes, while the curves for prevalence-dependent
intervention can have many more. Moreover, the behavior of the prevalence
curve is consistent across a number of parameters and can be described qualitatively with success. This is despite the simplicity of social distancing mechanism introduced by the piecewise constant activation and deletion rates α(t)
and ω(t), which take on values α∗ or ω ∗ respectively, or zero. We have not
considered the cases where the values of α∗ and ω ∗ may change over time, or
where α(t) and ω(t) are not piecewise constant. As such, our model has natural
extensions that may capture an even richer variety of qualitative behaviors.
Furthermore, the mechanisms proposed in this paper offer insights into
what makes for a successful intervention. We have used two metrics as simplified public health goals to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions: the
relative change in final size (RCFS) and the average infections above threshold (AIAT). For the more realistic prevalence-dependent intervention scheme,
we find that the most effective interventions come when the threshold number of infections is low and the intervention severely decreases average con22

tacts. When these conditions are met, the relative change in the final size is
greatly decreased and the length over which the intervention is implemented
has little impact on the effectiveness. However, even small increases in the
threshold value can greatly impact the effectiveness of interventions. As well,
if interventions do not sufficiently reduce contacts (around fifty percent), they
are rendered significantly less effective by both measures.
While this is a first foray into the use of adaptive networks to model social distancing for an SEIR disease, we acknowledge some limitations of our
model. First, there is a trade-off between complexity of the disease natural history model and the number of equations of the pairwise model; age-structured
models or other more complex compartmental models are popular for COVID19, but added compartments require tracking an increasing number of edge
types. However, even simple extensions (such as the inclusion of an asymptomatic infectious state) present interesting opportunities. Second, while the
random link activation/deletion process is simple to implement, it has some
unrealistic features. In particular, in the t → ∞ limit, one can show from the degree distribution generating function that the resulting network approaches an
Erdős-Rényi random graph, with vanishing clustering and an approximately
Poisson degree distribution. One manifestation of this property is a rapidly
declining clustering coefficient over time. While the piecewise constant activation and deletion rates mitigate this to an extent, the network resulting from
these social distancing policies is fundamentally different than the initial network state. To overcome this limitation, future investigations might involve
new processes for network dynamics, such as activation/deletion on a fixed
network or network dynamics on an underlying bipartite mixing network.

Adaptive SEIR with Complex Closure

In this appendix, we develop an adaptive network SEIR pairwise model for
heterogeneous, clustered networks. The model is analogous to the SIR model
for heterogeneous, clustered networks in House and Keeling (2011) with random link activation/deletion dynamics included.
The generic triple closure (12) proposed by House and Keeling (2011) can
be further developed by introducing a new variable θ(t), the proportion of
edges that have not transmitted the infection. With the observation that [Sk ] =
N pk θk , (12) becomes

Now we incorporate the effects of link activation and deletion. Notably, the
probability generating function for the degree distribution is now time- dependent, taking the form

As a consequence, the ordinary derivatives of g in (A.1)-(A.3) become partial

Ẏ = β

(A.5)
(A.6)

Next, the non-epidemiological network quantities in this model are entirely determined by the degree distribution probability generating function g(x, t) and
the clustering coefficient φ(t). We can express (23) in terms of the generating
function g(x, t) as

Additional Networks and Epidemiological
Parameters

In this appendix, we consider the prevalence-dependent intervention on two
alternative heterogeneous, clustered networks with our COVID-19 parameters
R0 = 2.4, η = 0.2 and γ = 0.1. We also consider the case where R0 has increased to 5 on the same networks, as well as the original unipartite projection
contact network from the main text. The two networks considered are a WattsStrogatz “small world” network and a power law network with clustering.
Both networks consist of N = 10, 000 nodes, as with the contact network in the
main text. For the small world network, hki ≈ 30, hk 2 − ki ≈ 900, φ ≈ 0.25;
for the the power law network with clustering, the relevant initial network parameters are hki ≈ 30, hk 2 − ki ≈ 2000, φ ≈ 0.1.
For each network, we report four sets of figures. First, we consider the
relative change in final size (RCFS) and that average infections above threshold (AIAT) for the prevalence-dependent intervention with q = 0.01 and p =
0.125, 0.25, 0.5. Each plot represents a combination of these two parameters,
and LI and LR vary on the axes from 2 to 180. Second, we fix LR = 90 and
LI = 15, 30, 60 and allow p and q to vary on the axes, with p ranging from 0 to
1 and q ranging from 0 to 0.03.
