Abstract
The production of corrugated paper boxes accounts for roughly one third of the world’s total
paper production and, as a result of both COVID-19 and the rise of e-commerce, is a growing
market. We provide a fresh approach to determining near-optimal stock policies for integrated
paper companies. The new approach shows that existing policies can be improved by a
significant margin. In a case study we saw a reduction in total waste by 9%, with a
simultaneous decrease in logistics costs.

1 Introduction
Corrugated box production accounts for approximately 1/3 of global paper / board production
and demand is rising, driven by the increase in deliveries and the recyclability of the material.
Corrugated boxes are produced by corrugating plants, which in turn consume paper produced
by paper mills. An integrated paper packaging company will have both paper mills and
corrugating plants. Typically, the latter outnumber the former by a factor of 5 or 10.
Production of corrugated boxes took off in the 1950’s with the introduction of the corrugator, a
machine that produces the multi-layer rectangular sheets that are then cut and folded into a
box (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrugated_fiberboard). A modern corrugator costs
tens of millions of euros / dollars and would be 2.5 m wide. It is fed by paper produced on a
paper machine. A typical modern paper machine will cost hundreds of millions of euros / dollars
and would be 5.0 – 9.0 m wide. Since boxes tend to be no wider than ~1.0 m, the mismatch of
widths gives rise to a linked cutting stock problem (CSP).
Because the corrugating plants operate an order-to-delivery cycle time of days if not hours,
paper inventory is held at the corrugating plants. This inventory, replenished from the paper
mill(s), is used on the corrugators to produce the sheets.
A typical corrugated material will contain three layers of paper, each of different grade and
thickness (for brevity we talk of grade, when in fact each grade can come in a variety of standard
thicknesses):

Figure 1. The three layers of corrugated material. A corrugator will consume reels of paper for each of the
layers and produce rectangular sheets of the required dimensions.

Different box types will share some paper grades, particularly for the fluting and less so for the
top/bottom (but there is some sharing even there). For the fluting layer, in terms of surface area,
1 m2 of box will require ~1.2 m2 of the middle layer; the precise number is determined by the
wavelength of this layer. In effect, there is a bill of materials (BoM) with an entry for each layer

of a box sheet. There are so many possible variations in box characteristics (dimensions, BoM,
cutouts, folding creases, printing) that in practice boxes are exclusively made-to-order.
The above is a highly simplified description of the process. There are many real-world
constraints that impact the analysis; we list some of them later on.
At a corrugator there is an opportunity to combine orders of different dimensions, but with
identical BoM. Because the corrugated board cannot be wound into reels (it has to remain flat),
it is cut into sheets in-line; most corrugators are double-knife, i.e. can only handle two distinct
sheet lengths at any time. This gives rise to a well-understood and solved semi-continuous
variant of the CSP (the first published reference we can find is in 1964 [1]; there are many
companies supplying software for solving this problem for the corrugating industry;
consequently, there are few academic publications). Figure 2 depicts a small, but otherwise
typical, corrugator instance:

Figure 2. Schematic of a corrugator CSP: Three sheet sizes (A, B & C), sharing a common BoM, are
produced on a single corrugator using two paper reel widths (2500 mm & 2200 mm). After producing the
first pattern (2 × A + B) from paper 2500 mm wide, the paper width is changed to 2200 mm to produce the
second pattern (A + C). A double-knife corrugator, such as the one depicted here, only allows two
different sheet lengths to be produced in any one pattern (so, the combination A+B+C would be
infeasible).

Other things being equal, it is preferable to run a corrugator at its maximum width. However,
this may generate too much waste (consider e.g. producing the second combination with orders
A & C out of the bigger reel width) and this is what induces multiple reel widths for the
inventory. Industry practice is to hold 8-12 reel widths (for each paper grade / grammage
combination) in inventory at the corrugating plant. We call the list of reel widths stocked at the
corrugating plants ({2200, 2500} in this example) the inventory policy.

Back at the paper mill, the demand from the corrugating plants (e.g. for the 2500 mm and
2200 mm reels) leads to another cutting stock problem. It is possible, indeed likely, that there

is a trade-off between the reel widths that suit the corrugator(s) and those that suit the paper
machine(s). So, the fundamental question addressed by this paper is to explore this trade-off
and determine a near-optimal policy.

2 Previous Work
There appears to be very little published work on this problem. The first related reference we
could find is from 1983 in [2]:
“The maximum width roll of liner and medium that can be processed by a corrugator at a
box plant is a function of the design of the corrugator. In addition to the maximum size
roll, most plants stock a number of narrower width rolls. This decision obviously leads to
an increase in box plant inventory and a reduction in corrugator productivity. The primary
motivation for stocking multiple roll widths is to reduce side trim generated at the
corrugator. Because side trim is such an easily measured factor, it generally dominates in
the stock size selection process. This can easily lead to a proliferation of stocking sizes. The
costs associated with increased inventory and reduced corrugator utilization is more
difficult to isolate and measure. This inhibits making an economic tradeoff to determine
the number of sizes to stock.”
However, this does not consider the trim efficiency at the paper machine(s) and is therefore
closer to the classical assortment problem [3]. Several commercial suppliers that offer
corrugator CSP software also offer “roll stock analysis”, which aims to recommend inventory
policies based on historical corrugator demand. However this “analysis” is done, it only looks at
the corrugator efficiency, ignoring the impact on the paper machines. The sub-optimality of the
resulting solution is made more stark when we consider that the waste generated at the paper
machines is often significantly higher than that at the corrugators (more about this later).
In their otherwise comprehensive look at scheduling issues in the paper industry of 2001, [4] do
not discuss our problem at all. Similarly, it fails to appear in the 2009 survey [5] and follow-on
2019 survey [6] of supply chain problems in the paper industry.
We speculate that the reason for the paucity of relevant research is the computational
intractability of the underlying problem, perhaps coupled with the need to link statistical
aspects with combinatorial optimisation ones.

3 Practical Aspects
We list below some of the aspects and constraints that may be necessary in any real-world
implementation:

3.1 External Demand
It is possible that some of the paper grades used for corrugating boxes are supplied by external
suppliers. These do not need to be taken into account at the paper machine CSP. Conversely, it
is possible that the paper machines also produce paper for external demand; such demand does
not directly impact the corrugating plants, but affects the CSP instances at the paper machines.
The presence of external supply of / demand for paper complicates the notion of percentage
waste. This is best illustrated with an example: A paper mill produces 1,000 T, with 3% waste
(30 T). Of the 970 T net production, 600 T goes to the open market and the corrugators consume
the remaining 370 T. The corrugators also buy, from external suppliers, 130 T. Their input
material consumption is therefore 500 T, and they incur 2% waste (10 T) on this. It is hard to
defend any specific total percentage waste calculation in the circumstances. We use the

09/11/2020 10:58

3

convention of adding up the total waste (30 T + 10 T = 40 T) and expressing this as percentage
of the total paper machine production, i.e. 4.0% in this case.

3.2 Triple-knife Corrugators
Most of the world’s corrugators are double-knife, meaning they can cut up to two different sheet
lengths at a time, as shown in Figure 2. For those, industry practice is to keep 8-12 reel widths
in inventory. However, triple-knife corrugators exist; these can combine three order lengths at
a time. This additional flexibility reduces the number of reel widths in a near-optimal policy
down to one or two.

3.3 Different Materials / Box Types
Most corrugated boxes have three layers. However, 5-layer (double-wall) boxes are used for
heavier objects. Also, some packaging scenarios call for a 2-layer material (single-facer).

3.4 Downgrades / Upgrades
Material substitution is common practice in the industry. For instance, you could substitute a
200 g/m2 paper for one with 180 g/m2, therefore giving the end customer a slightly higher
specification. The additional cost may be offset by other factors such as reduced trim waste or
inventory / logistics costs.

3.5 Demand Assignment to Corrugators
When an integrated paper company receives an order for a box, it typically has to decide which
corrugating plant to assign this to (box orders are almost never split across plants). This is
typically decided by transportation cost and production capability considerations. Once the
corrugating plant has been determined, there is a further decision as to which specific
corrugator will produce this order (orders are almost never split across corrugators).

3.6 Paper Machine Production Cycles
Almost all paper machines operate a production cycle, e.g. grade Testliner, basis weight
180 g/m2 is produced every second week, followed by the same grade, basis weight 200 g/m2,
etc. Although there is evidence that some of these cycles are sub-optimal, it is very difficult to
change them, as well as being a difficult-to-solve (non-convex) optimisation problem.

3.7 Multi-paper-machine Scenarios
In the general case, there will be multiple paper machines in multiple paper mills. As a result,
there is a sourcing decision to be taken. For example, two different paper machines, of differing
widths, potentially located in different mills (thus inducing differences in transportation costs)
could source the same paper grade.

3.8 Policy Uniformity
An integrated paper company will have many corrugating plants, each potentially with multiple
corrugators. A uniform policy means that at each plant, the items that are inventoried are a
subset of the overall policy. This is dictated by corrugator constraints. For instance, one plant
may have a large corrugator, which is 2700 mm wide; another plant’s maximum corrugator

09/11/2020 10:58

4

width may be 2500 mm. There is no point in the second plant holding inventory of items wider
than 2500 mm. Even with a uniform policy, the quantities of each of its elements will vary by
plant (as shown in Figure 2).
However non-uniform policies are also possible: each of the plants may have a policy of specific
cardinality, but the policies can vary across corrugating plants. For example, one corrugating
plant may specialise in boxes for agriculture, another plant may specialise in boxes for ecommerce. The dimensional characteristics of these could be different and there is no need for
the inventory to have any common reel widths.
We present here results for uniform policies alone, but the approach naturally extends to nonuniform ones as well.
At a single corrugating plant one might have thought that in general different paper grades need
different policies. However, the fact that boxes are made up of several grades creates a coupling
constraint: the three input reels at any given time (for each of the box’s layers) must be of the
same width. The middle layer in particular (fluting) is common across many different types of
boxes. In practice, a common policy across paper grades at a single plant is the industry norm.

3.9 Paper Cost Variability
Paper is sold by weight, reflecting the underlying material, energy and capital costs. Therefore
one talks of cost per tonne for the material. However, different grades / grammages may have
different production costs per tonne. This is important in our context because we want to
determine the cost of a policy: if the production costs are essentially identical across grades /
grammages, then we can just add the weight of the waste. On the other hand, if the production
costs vary significantly, we would want to create a financial objective function reflecting the cost
of the waste.

3.10 Transportation Cost
When waste is produced at the paper mill, then it is typically recycled on-site and does not incur
any transportation cost. However, waste generated at the corrugating plant has to be
transported back to a paper mill for recycling. Depending on the distance and the transportation
modes, there might be differences between corrugating plants for these costs.

3.11 Static vs. Dynamic Policies
One of the fundamental difficulties in all types of inventory policy is how to adjust them to
reflect demand that varies over time. As the underlying problem is combinatorial, the risk arises
that an optimal policy for a particular time period is completely different from an optimal policy
for another period, even if nothing else changes.
Whilst this is certainly true, we have to face the reality that integrated paper companies lack
optimisation-based tools to evaluate, at least periodically, their policy. As a result, companies
are often locked into policies that are inherited and sub-optimal.

4 Approach
4.1 Model & Objective Function
The fundamental building block of our approach is the policy denoted by P. This consists of a
set of reel widths that will be kept in inventory. For example, one such policy consists of {1350,

09/11/2020 10:58

5

1770, 1830, 1960, 2040, 2160, 2260, 2435, 2500}. We call | P | the cardinality of P; in this example
it is 9. The determination of a cost for P involves three steps:
1.

Determining the waste at the corrugators for policy P

2. Determining the waste at the paper machine, using the results from the solutions that
were obtained at the previous step
3. Combining the two waste measures
We describe each of these steps below.
Corrugator Waste
𝑃𝑃
Given a policy P and a particular CSP instance for the corrugator, we can determine 𝑤𝑤𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐
, the
minimum waste when using P to supply the instance by solving the corresponding CSP. For
example, for the instance:

Item №

and policy P = {2200, 2500}, one waste-optimal solution is:

Figure 4. Solution to corrugator CSP instance. In this case 𝒘𝒘𝑷𝑷𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄 = 239 kg (3.071%) and we require 891 kg of
2200 mm and 6901 kg of 2500 mm. If the BoM for this box type were Liner_A-Fluting-Liner_B in a weight
ratio of 40-20-40, then the solution consumes 40% × 891 kg = 356 kg of Liner_A / width 2200 mm, etc.

So, given a policy P and a corrugator CSP instance, we can determine
1.

The cost (waste) of an optimal solution

2. The quantity required for each element (grade & width) of the policy.

09/11/2020 10:58

We observe that both of these are highly dependent on the actual policy. E.g. changing from
{2200, 2500} to {2125, 2500} (a change of only 75 mm in one of the policy elements) instead
generates an answer with:
1.

𝑃𝑃
𝑤𝑤𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐
= 200 kg (2.584%)

2. We require 1912 kg of 2125 mm and 5838 kg of 2500 mm.
At the end of this iterative process we will have determined the total corrugator waste 𝑤𝑤𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 =
𝑛𝑛
∑𝑛𝑛 𝑤𝑤𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐
and the time-phased quantity for each of the policy’s elements (e.g. we require 76 T of
width 1830 mm of a specific grade in week 23).
Paper Machine Waste
In the previous step we have constructed the time-phased demand per grade at the paper
machine(s). For example, for one particular grade, in one time period, we might end up with:

On a paper machine that is 6000 mm wide, an optimal solution (allowing a tolerance of -0% /
+5% on the quantity) to the corresponding CSP is:

Figure 5. Optimal solution to paper machine CSP, with one paper machine, waste 𝒘𝒘𝑷𝑷𝒑𝒑𝒑𝒑 = 19403 kg (2.321%)

We address the more general case, where there are multiple paper machines potentially
supplying the same paper grade, by solving a multi-machine CSP. This has similarities with the
corrugator CSP, when using a policy with multiple widths. Figure 6 shows the same instance,
but with two paper machines, 4300 mm & 6000 mm wide:

Figure 6. Optimal solution to paper machine CSP, with two paper machines, waste 𝒘𝒘𝑷𝑷𝒑𝒑𝒑𝒑 = 6754 kg (0.825%).
Note how some sizes (e.g. the 2400 mm) are sourced from both paper machines.

By summing the waste across all paper machine CSP instances, we will have determined, for
policy P, the total waste at the paper machine, wpm.
Policy Cost
The overall cost of the policy is then defined to be z = β wcor + wpm, β > 1. The reason for β > 1 is
that waste at the paper machine can be recycled on-site, whereas waste at the corrugator needs
to be transported back to the paper mill(s).

09/11/2020 10:58

Observation I – Non-linearity
It is clearly the case that if we take two CSP instances A & B (for the same master sizes) and we
merge them, then the waste of the resulting solution will be no more than the sum of the original
instances:
𝑤𝑤𝐴𝐴∪𝐵𝐵 ≤ 𝑤𝑤𝐴𝐴 + 𝑤𝑤𝐵𝐵

This is because all patterns that are feasible for A and B, are also feasible for A∪B. In practice,
we would expect, most of the time, a strict inequality to apply. This non-linearity stops us from
assembling a “giant” CSP instance, one for each corrugator. Instead, we have to use a statistical
approach, where the corrugator CSP’s are as representative as possible of the real ones.
In addition, one might imagine that, because the widths of a policy P are common across all
paper grades, we would have to solve only one instance at the paper machine. However, the
required quantities are all different and this precludes us from using such a shortcut.
Observation II – Non-dominance
Suppose that we have two policies, 𝑃𝑃1 , 𝑃𝑃2 ∶ 𝑃𝑃1 ⊆ 𝑃𝑃2 . We can easily see that
𝑃𝑃

𝑃𝑃

1
2
𝑤𝑤𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐
≥ 𝑤𝑤𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐

because every solution for policy P1 is also valid for P2. For the corrugator, as we increase the
cardinality, the optimal waste cannot increase.
However, we cannot draw a similar conclusion for the waste at the paper machine stage. A trivial
example would be to compare the policies P1 = {2500} and P2 = {2200,2500} for a paper machine
that is 5000 mm wide. Policy P1 incurs no paper machine waste, whereas P2 most definitely does.
It follows that we cannot draw any conclusions regarding z = β wcor + wpm. Somewhat counterintuitively, an optimal policy with cardinality n can be better overall than one with n+k; this
phenomenon is observed in practice.

4.2 Policy Search
We have outlined above a process for assigning a figure of merit, related to the waste / cost, for
an inventory policy P. But how can we search efficiently in the space of P?
Determining the objective function for each P is time-consuming. In a mid-sized real-world
study there would be several thousand corrugator CSP instances and a few hundred paper
machine CSP instances. In the test-case we report below, it takes ~30 minutes on a modern
computer to determine the cost of a policy.
Searching the inventory policy space is problematic, particularly as each policy evaluation is so
time-consuming. We started first searching for policies with the same cardinality as an initial,
baseline, policy. Can we derive some information to guide the search? One way to do this is to
assign a waste to each element of the policy, so that we can distinguish between “good” and
“bad” reel widths. This is straightforward for the corrugator waste. It is not so clear for the paper
machine case; we use the logic illustrated in Figure 7:

09/11/2020 10:58

9

50 T x

2500

1700

800

Figure 7. Example 50 T pattern produced on a 5000 mm paper machine. The pattern wastes 800 mm. We
attribute the waste proportionately to the constituent elements, so the 2500 mm is assigned
50 × (800 / 5000) × (2500 / 5000) = 4 T, etc.

In this manner, we can distribute the total waste to each of the elements of the policy. This is a
kind of sensitivity information for each reel width.
We used a tabu local search: starting from an initial policy we perturb it using a variety of
“moves”, some of them random, others based on the sensitivity information obtained as above.
The end result carries no optimality guarantee of course.
Every analysed policy P is compared against best policy found so far, P*. If the new policy is
worse than the best, but “close”, it is worth to explore further, by applying more perturbations
to it. In order to limit the number of policies we perturb, we determine whether a policy is close
enough to the best, by using a threshold ε, initially set to ε = 30%. If the new policy is within ε
of the best, then it is close enough and we allow perturbations. This promotes diversification.
In order to favour intensification as the search progresses, we apply a decay factor δ = 0.05 on
the threshold as a function of the number of analysed policies N:
𝑧𝑧(𝑃𝑃)
≤ 1 + 𝜀𝜀𝑒𝑒 −𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿
𝑧𝑧(𝑃𝑃∗ )

If the above inequality holds, P is explored further.

Besides encouraging diversification, the search follows a “depth-first” approach, by perturbing
and evaluating the best policies first. For example, if P is evaluated and turns to be the new best,
it will be perturbed a number of times and the resulting new policies will be placed first in a
prioritised queue of policies to analyse. This logic is applied, analogously, for each evaluated
policy, no matter whether it is a new best.
Although evaluating a policy is a time-consuming task, each can be executed independently of
the others. So, we can examine in parallel as many policies as the available hardware allows.
Taking the number of physical processors (cores) proved to be a good value for the number of
policies that can be evaluated simultaneously.
Since the heuristic has no optimality guarantee and a lower bound is very difficult to obtain, we
are reduced to using statistical techniques ([7], [8]) for estimating the optimal value / optimality

We estimate the global minimum as the location parameter of a Weibull distribution fitted to
the data. For this scenario, the A* estimator for the location parameter of the Weibull
distribution as recommended in [9] is 10.123%, remarkably close to the minimum actually
achieved of 10.131%.

5 Case Study
We were asked by one of our clients, with one paper mill (with a single paper machine) and
three corrugating plants, to examine the following two questions:
a. Is their current inventory policy optimal?
b. If they were to replace one of the 2.5 m wide corrugators, should they buy a wider one
at 2.8 m or keep to the existing size?
The data for answering these two questions consists of 5,362 corrugator instances and 124 for
the paper machine.
We present results for the unrealistic case of β = 1, i.e. we treat paper machine and corrugator
waste as cost-equivalent, as a means of shrouding the commercially sensitive actual results.
For question (a) we started with our client’s initial policy, which had cardinality 11. The total
waste for their current policy was 11.08%. The policy search identified a policy with total waste
of 10.131%, a reduction of around 9%. We were also able to identify a policy with cardinality 9
(two fewer than the baseline) with even lower total waste of 9.95%.
For question (b), the empirical result was that a 2.8 m corrugator is highly advantageous without
requiring an increase in the policy cardinality. With the same cardinality of 11, the total waste
09/11/2020 10:58

11

drops to 8.88%. This is quite surprising because the fact that the new corrugator is wider implies
fewer reel widths are available for the existing ones.

6 Conclusions and Further Work
The approach we have presented here is promising in identifying policies that improve on the
status quo.
However, due to the heuristic nature of the search, we are troubled by the lack of a nonstatistical lower bound and this could be an interesting topic for future research. One step that
would facilitate this research is improving the computational efficiency of the process – the
more policies we can evaluate in a given period, the more confident we can be of the results.
