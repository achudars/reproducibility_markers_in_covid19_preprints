Abstract
In the midst of pandemic for respiratory illness, the call for non-pharmaceutical interventions
become the highest priority for infectious disease and public health experts, while the race
towards vaccine or medical intervention are ongoing. Individuals may modify their behavior
and take preventative steps to reduce infection risk in the bid to adhere to the call by
government officials and experts. As a result, the existence of relationship between the
preliminary and the final transmission rates become feeble. This study evaluates the
behavioral changes (mitigation and suppression measures) proposed by public health experts
for COVID-19 which had altered human behavior and their day to day lives. The dynamics
underlying the mitigation and suppression measures reduces the contacts among citizens and
significantly interfere with their physical and social behavior. The results show all the
measures have a significant impact on the decline of transmission rate. However, the
mitigation measures might prolong the elimination of the transmission which might lead to a
severe economic meltdown, yet, a combination of the measures show a possibility of rooting
out transmission within 30 days if adhered to in an extreme manner. The result shows a peak
period of infection for Ghana ranges from 64th day to 74th day of infection time period.

1.0 Introduction
Late December 2019, China reported and confirmed a new pneumonia case caused by a virus
called novel corona virus, or SARS-COV-2 (named COVID-19 disease by WHO) within the city of
Wuhan in the Hubei province. The virus spread rapidly from 41 confirmed cases to 5,974 within

1

18 days (10-28 January, 2020), surpassing the SARS pandemic flu. By 4th April 2020, COVID-19
had spread to 201 countries/regions across every continent, threatening overwhelming the
health-care systems of several countries and threatening to ground global economy. There
has been 1,681,954 reported cases with 102,026 deaths as at 10th April 2020 (23:58 GMT), and
228,923 recovered. Active cases stood at 810,351 persons worldwide (Worldometers, 2020).
China, the epicenter of the pandemic has been surpassed by USA (491,358 cases, 18,316
deaths), Italy (119,827 cases, 14,681 deaths), Spain (119,199 cases, 11,198 deaths), Germany
(91,159 cases, 1,275 deaths). In Africa, South Africa is leading with 2,173 cases, 25 deaths,
followed by Egypt (2,065 cases, 159 deaths), Algeria (1,914 cases, 293 deaths), Morocco (1,746
cases, 120 deaths), Cameroon (820 cases, 12 deaths), Tunisia (707 cases, 31 deaths), Ivory Coast
(566 cases, 5 deaths) and Ghana (566 cases, 8 deaths) as 13th April, 2020, 11:48 GMT
(Worldometers, 2020).
The severity of transmission appears to be broader than previously thought with the
pandemic spreading quickly across the world within a short time and its virulence has been
estimated to be high, but, the elderly and those with underlying health conditions
experiencing higher mortality rates (Neil M. F., Laydon D., Gemma N-G. et al., 2020). The early
stages of the transmission posed challenges for estimating the transmission dynamics of the
infection (Funk S., Ciglenecki I., Tiffany .A, et al., 2017), ). However, recovery over weeks has
provided insight into the epidemiological situation and has helped identify whether mitigation
and suppression strategies are having desired effects in the populations (Riley S., Fraser C.,
Donnelly C.A., et al., 2003). The insight elicited can be used to inform prediction of distribution
patterns (Viboud C., Sun K., Gaffey R., et al. , 2018), and estimation of risk in other countries
(Cooper B.S., Pitman R.J., Edmunds W.J., et al., 2006). It would also help in the design of
alternative non-pharmaceutical interventions (Kucharski A.J., Camacho A., Checchi F, et al.,
2015).
While the understanding of the SARS COV-2 and their prevention is not fully known, and the
varied prevention strategies for infectious diseases, the world faces a unison challenge from
a virus with comparable lethality to H1N1 influenza in 1918. Two strategies being promoted by
health experts based on the evidence from China, Singapore, South Korea and other countries
are Suppression} and mitigation (Neil M. F., Laydon D., Gemma N-G. et al., 2020).
 Suppression: seeks to prevent/reduce secondary transmission.
 Mitigation (Flatten the Curve): at curtailing prevalence rate of the disease (flatten the
curve) in order to reduce on health-care providers and facilities and consequently
reduce mortality.
This study seeks to assess these two strategies and their hypothetical impact on COVID-19
transmission and management within Sub-Saharan Africa (Ghana specifically)given the

2

steady rise of confirmed cases and partial lock-down of the two epicenters of the disease
(Greater Accra and Greater Kumasi).

2.0 Method
2.1 The Growth Models
Pathogens transmission are known to be transmitted in an exponential manner, this is
however constrained by natural systems and resulting in the S-shaped curve made possible
by the use of ordinary differential equations. The exponential growth of pathogen
multiplication is represented with a model without limits. The growth rate is proportional to
the population P represented as
dP  t 
dt

  P t 

1

with
P  t     e t

2

where  is the growth rate and  is the initial population of organisms as the population
closes to the limit  .
To find the growth rate for a short period, natural log is taken on both side resulting as.

ln    t  ln P  t 

3

A simple linear regression is fitted on ln  against t and the gradient  is estimated to be the
growth rate.
The logistic model is presented as;
dP  t 

P t  

  P  t  1 

 


dt

4

solving this for P(t) gives
P t  



1  exp    t    

5

where  is the growth rate,  is the population limit,  specifies the time when the curve
reaches K / 2 .
Pathogen transmission is highly dependent on the transmission rate (R0), thus the infectivity
of an infectious person is dependent on the latent and infection period of the pathogen
therefore, the relationship can be written as
R0  e

  1/ 2  2 2

6

3

R0  1   / a 1   / b 

7

where R0 is the transmission rate,  exponential growth rate,  is mean serial interval,  is
the standard deviation of the serial interval, 1 / a is latent period and 1 / b the infectious period.
The expected import of social distancing being promoted by epidemiologists is the reduction
of R0. Becker, Niels (2015) proposed a transmission model for social distancing,
R  1  1  a 2  f   R0



8

where f is the proportion of the population engaging in social distancing to decrease their
interpersonal contacts to a fraction a of their normal contacts.

2.2 Social Contact Mixing Modeling
The most important aspect of suppressing or mitigating against diseases during pandemic is
managing social contact mixing among humans. Data shared through various studies
describing social contact mixing were leverage in addition to the online tool to analyse the
survey data which captures participant, contact, survey day, household and time use data (see
www.socialcontactdata.org). To account for country level social contact rate on a weekly
basis, the study make use of weights to account for age and number of social contact within
the week (5/7) and weekend (2/7) days. The study adopt weight controlling measure (Eames,
K., Tilston, N., White, P et al,. 2010) to limit the influence of single individual social contact rate to
3 to be in line with United Nation’s World Population Prospects. The estimation of social
contact matrix is represented by (Hens, Ayele, , Goeyvaertset al, 2009) and captured in Lander,
Thang, Sebastian et al., 2020.

reciprocal where mi , j N i , is equal to m j ,i N j ,therefore, to resolve this difference in reciprocity
reporting can be imposed by;

mi , j N i  m j ,i N j
2Ni

10

where N i and N j represent the population size in age class i and j respectively (UN, 2019).

The average secondary transmission in age class i by an infected person of age class j into a
susceptible population can be represented with the next generation matrix G defined as;
G  DMq

11

where M is the contact matrix, q is the proportional factor and D is the mean duration of
infectiousness (Held L., Hens, N., ONeil D. et al., 2019; Diekmann O., Heesterbeek J. and Metx
J, 1990). The factor measuring proportionality combines several diseases-specific factors that
are related to susceptibility and infectiousness indicated in a formulation as;
g i , j  D  mi , j  s i  k j  q

12

where k j represents the infectiousness of age group j , q denotes other diseases specific
characters and si represents the susceptibility of age group i . Therefore, the leading right
eigenvector of G is proportional to the expected incidence by age and the transmission rate
for secondary infection Ro as the dominant Eigen value of G (Chang W, Cheng J, Allaire J, et
al, 2017). To evaluate the mitigation and suppression measures, the study focuses on the
relative impact of social contact pattern on the rate of second transmission referred to as the
social contact hypothesis (Funk S, Socialmixr, 2020) by cancelling out diseases specific
characters expressed as ‘

where subscripts a and b denote different conditions, S and K represent age specific
susceptibility and infectiousness respectively (Eurostat, 2019). Hierarchical order is leverage
to cater for multiple location contacts such as home, work, transport, leisure, market. Closure

The transmission reduction rate from the above formulation is adopted to be used as input in
measuring the possible impact for the scenario.
3.0 Data Assimilation and Integration
This study also combines different pre-analyzed data from leading epidemiological teams
around the world ( Neil M. F., Laydon D., Gemma N-G. et al., (2020); Hermanowicz (2020);
Cowling and Leung (2020); Riou and Althaus (2020); Li et al., (2020a); Rabajante (2020); Su et
al., (2020); Li et al., (2020b); Shujuan, Jiayue, Minyan et al., 2020; Chang, W., Cheng, J., Allaire,
J., Xie, Y. et al., 2017; Geng et al., (2020); Funk, socialmixr, (2020); Lander W., Thang V. H.,
Sebastian F. et al., (2020)) to form a predictive model to help explain the possible scenarios
under the various intervention strategies.
This data is basically gathered from China, UK, Italy, Germany, Spain and South Korea, Japan.
Though not much differences exist in terms of factors that facilitate the spreading of the SARS
COV-2 in these regions. The common factors among these countries include the weather,
settlement patterns and a robust health-care facilities comparatively far better than those
found in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, some values such as the transmission rate or the basic
reproduction number is very important as it gives information to the average number of
secondary infections which is vital for prediction in any setting irrespective of prevailing local
conditions .
Different basic reproduction numbers (R0) or rate for secondary infection for COVID-19 have
been reported by different studies from these countries (Table 1). These values ranges from
1.4 to 7.0, confirming the virulent nature and the uncertainty surrounding its infectious rate in

6

different studies. COVID-19 come from the same family of viruses as SARS and display
similarities, but the high transmission rates poses the greatest threat to mankind over a
century.

Recent study in UK (Shujuan, Jiayue, Minyan et al., 2020.), estimated the basic reproduction
number used for intervention measurement from 2.0 to 2.6, such transmission rate is a
reflection of the planned structures, family size and community engagements which exist in
the country, it is expected that, the values of Ghana might be higher, however, expected to
fall within the range of previous studies as shown in Table 1 .
As reported, incubation period is assumed to be 5.1 days (Linton N.M., Kobayashi T., Yang Y.,
et al., 2020; Li Q., Guan X., Wu P., et al., 2020). Infectiousness is 12 hours for pre-symptomatic
and symptomatic and 4.6 days for asymptomatic (Riou J, Althaus CL. Pattern, 2020).\\

7

Symptomatic individuals are 10-50\% more infectious than asymptomatic individuals and a
uniform distribution is fitted to quantify for the uncertainty in variations of infection,
additionally, infectiousness seeded in each country shows an exponential rate. Thus, doubling
every 5 days (Neil M. F., Laydon D., Gemma N-G. et a.l, 2020). All other input values are shown

3.1 Intervention Strategies
The model analyzes the impact of mitigation and suppression on reducing the rate of
transmission and demand on health-care facilities by spreading the demand over a long period
of time. Data on mitigation and suppression were gathered from publicly available data of the
ongoing COVID -19 epidemic. Data for the various interventions are as shown on Table 3.

4.0 Analysis and Results
The study considered 3 scenarios, first is a ‘no intervention’ (Business as usual) situation,
where the virus is allowed to move through the population seamlessly. The second scenario
is putting in place mitigation measures, which includes voluntary home quarantine, case
isolation, social distancing of some extent (partial lock-down) to most susceptible group.
Lastly, the suppression measures which combines case isolation, social distancing of the

9

entire population, and either household quarantine or school and university closure as
reported by Stephanie Soucheray (2020).

4.1 Results from Social Contact Mixing
The use of online Socrates (socialcontact.org) tool to study the effect of school closure and
teleworking on transmission rates within the African countries were studied. The
respondents’ age were categorized into 4 classes, 0-18 years, 19-45 years, 45-60 years and 60+
years. Holiday period data was excluded before contact rate was estimated. The reference
proportion of telework was fixed at 5\% to present relative increase in Telework and
transmission dynamics were captured from 10\% to 70\% telework with school closure. The
impact on transmission was made to reflect the vulnerability of the elderly and was fixed at
0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.0 respectively. The study found out, these measures impact the transmission rate
by 10% reduction, therefore closure of school and increase telework will have more contact in
the community but reduction of transfer of pathogens among children which is a source of
pathogen transfer to adults. This result was incorporated into the other measures to reflect
the situation in Ghana, since the president ordered for school and universities closures before
all other mitigation measures were laid out.

Data fitting
Fitting the COVID-19 data in Ghana (cumulative data points as at 12th April, 2020) to the
exponential model, the model recorded a growth rate of 0.151794 (0.116759 to 0.186829)
resulting in a transmission rate of 2.31 to 4.08. These values gave more insight into the possible
modeling of future epidemics and how the measures taken by government will impact on the
spread. This result (Table 4, see \ref{table4}) helps in the further modeling procedure of
examining the peak time and the peak number of COVID-19 cases. Ghana reported its first case
on 12th March, 2020, and had its first compulsory quarantine of all foreign arrivals on 21st
March, 2020, making all cases up to this date had a possible community asymptomatic
transmission.

4.2 Results for COVID-19 Projections
Results in Table 5(see \ref{table5}) show estimated descriptive values for projected possible
number of transmissions by the model for the three different scenarios. It also takes into
consideration quantifying of the uncertainty in the projections by estimating for both
minimum and maximum possible projections of transmission for 30 days and 60 days of
COVID-19 projections for Ghana

4.3 Projection of Possible Confirmed Cases
Ghana will continue to have increasing confirmed cases of COVID-19 for the next two weeks,
these cases will be strictly increasing until the peak time (Figure 1). The increment projections
are as a result of the continuous comprehensive mass testing and surveillance in addition to
the contact tracing currently underway. As indicated in Figure 1, the confirmed cases might
rise up steadily to 1000 cases in not too distant future by 21st April, 2020, this projection is to
give indication to the respond team to plan ahead in the management of cases that might
come out as a result of the testing currently taking place.

11

Figure 1: Projection of Possible COVID-19 Cases in Ghana simulated from the number of
confirmed cases.
4.4. Projections for No Intervention Scenario (Business as usual)
The "Business as usual" scenario projection (Figure 2, Table 5) transmission ranges from 6,774
to 55,436 transmission cases with modal value of 6, 845 cases projected for 30 days in Ghana
if mass testing of affected areas are carried out. The 60 days projections was estimated
between 138,440 and 15,064,182, thus, approximately 0.4% to 53.8\% of the population in a
free fall 60 days transmission, the modal projected estimation for 60-days stands 229,751. The
projected transmission number could be higher for Ghana in both the 30-days and 60 days
projections if authorities continues to confirm more horizontal (community transmission)
cases which are not previously known, or if the vertical cases (imported) patients are found
to have spent days within the communities as asymptomatic carriers of the virus. “Quote: ‘The
assumption is that, the total number of COVID-19 cases is not known. It is however certain
that the total number of COVID-19 cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases. This is
due to limited testing, without widespread testing for COVID-19 we can neither know how the
pandemic is spreading nor appropriately respond to it. The best preliminary research data will
need to be revised as the pandemic progress and new cases confirmed. This is so because a
new reported case on any specified day do not necessarily represent a new case on that
particular day’ unquote (ourworldindata, 2020)".

12

4.4.1 Mitigation Measures
The mitigation measures (voluntary home quarantine, case isolation, Partial lock-down) show
a significant reduction in transmission. Each measure ensures a substantial decline in cases if
strictly adhered to, using the modal value, case isolation brings the projected cases to 1,631.79
and with possible range of 1,615.72 to 11,698.38. Voluntary quarantine has a modal value of
2,023.82 and ranges from 2,003.71 to 14,737.83 possible projected cases and that of partial
lockdown has a modal value of 1,194.16 and ranges from 1,182.53 to 8,359.97 (Table 5, see
\ref{table5}). The predictions exceeds critical bed capacity, and this is a necessary measure
that needs to be in place as long as the epidemic is in force.
Among the mitigation measures, case isolation and partial lock-down are the most effective
methods to flatten the curve. The modal projected transmission keeps declining with each
mitigation adopted, however, it should be noted, in these scenarios the closure of school and
universities are inclusive, since these measures have already been implemented by the
government as the first strategy before other mitigations measures were considered, the
impact of the mitigation measures is attributed to the decline in contact within the younger
generation.
4.4.2 Suppression Measures
The introduced suppression measures (Table 5) had the most impact in decreasing the
transmission projected numbers for each scenario It, should be emphasized that, the 30-day
suppression measures was every effective in reducing the projected transmission number.. A
combination of Case Isolation, Voluntary Quarantine and Social Distancing of entire
population and partial lock-down projected transmission is the most effective way of
managing the epidemic. However, these measures should be adhered to in an extreme
manner in order to achieve the results. When examining these mitigation and suppression
measures, the study assumes a force adherence of 30 to 90 days or longer in order to
effectively achieve the desirable results. Overall, the relative effectiveness of the measures is
sensitive to the combination of scenarios chosen to be in force in order to control the
epidemics.

4.5 Peak Time Analysis
The peak period for maximum infection is expected to be within the 69th day after the first
infection with uncertainty quantification putting the period anywhere between 63 rd day to
74th day after infection. The total number of infections if nothing is done could reach 75.43\%
(Figure 3 and Figure 4) of the population from the projections. Given the time to peak
infection, the model conclusion is hinged on a possible extension of social distancing longer
than the prescribed 14-day partial lock-down. As shown on Figure 1, the peak probable
cumulative infection number could reach 100,000 plus infection by the peak time if mass

13

testing and other measures are not effectively enforced. However, COVID-19 has been
observed to display different pattern of reproduction in malaria endemic countries, this could
be reduced as a result of herd immunity due to the use of hydroxychloroquine in treatment
of COVID 19 (myjoyonline, 2020).
It is imperative that the suppression measures be enforced by government to achieve a
reproduction rate less than 1. This is necessary given the dire state of the health-care facility
in Ghana and its gross inadequacy to provide the required services needed in the event of a
major outbreak.
The uncertainties of the effectiveness of mitigation measures
notwithstanding, it provides the surest way to prevent an escalation of COVID-19 cases in
Ghana when coupled with individual measures such as cleaning of hands with soaps under
running water, avoidance of crowded spaces, avoidance of traditional hand greetings and the
use
of
hand
sanitizers
as
well
as
staying
home.

5.0 Discussions
The present study on COVID-19 transmission were explicitly estimates projected using publicly
available data. The outcome shows effectiveness of mitigation and suppression measures to
flatten the transmission curve, even though the 30-day projections seems encouraging for
declining projected transmission number, an ideal situation is a 3-4 months suppression
measures in order to control the epidemic (Stephanie Soucheray, 2020). The estimated
projections for combination of measures and within time frame is consistent with the practice
in China, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan which have recorded cases below that predicted by
experts (Xiuli Liu, Geoffrey Hewings, Shouyang Wang , Minghui Qin, Xin Xiang, Shan Zheng,
Xuefeng, 2020). It should be pointed out that , the estimations are in line with projections by
experts in UK and goes on to confirm the possibility of adopting these measures in order to
defeat the virulent transmission of COVID-19 (Neil M F, Laydon D, Gemma N-G etl al, 2020).
The relative effectiveness of the measures from countries which have experienced the impact
of COVID-19 cannot be underestimated, due to the fact that the implementation of parts or
combinations of these measures have successfully resulted in achieving some sort of positive
impact up to date, New Zealand, China, Singapore, Italy and New York (USA) are examples.
To large extent, population wide social distancing within the entire country would have had
the largest impact to control the virus transmission and bring the basic reproduction number
less than 1, thereby rapidly reducing the case incidence within the population. Even though,
the results show a possible control of COVID-19 within 30 days, to avoid re-insurgence due to
reinfection, the measures need to stay longer to eliminate the transmission completely. As
argued out by Neil M F, Laydon D, Gemma N-G et al. (2020) Ghana as a developing country
cannot as a feasible policy sustain prolonged suppression measures due to the economic
impact it might have and a possible recession halting the rebound of the national economy, a
3-4 months suppression with intermittent relaxation when improvement is realized is the
viable option whiles waiting for a pharmaceutical intervention such as vaccine is developed.\\\\

Several limitation to the present study exist. Firstly, the study relies on published information
on the ongoing crisis, though, no country or study has been able to put out the full picture or
understands the transmission completely. This information are based on the decisions made
by the organizations or government agencies that put out the information. Secondary, the
study did not take into consideration the effect of high temperature had on the transmission
level, as Ghana is a tropical country with high temperatures known to be far higher than what
experts say the virus could survive under (Fauci, 2020). Finally, the study uses growth rate
which have been recorded at the early stage of transmission subject to intrinsic and extrinsic
health factors in the various countries where the cases were imported from. Whiles we

acknowledge these limitations, we believe the current study throws more light on possible
impacts of the interventions and feasibility of projections given data availability.
