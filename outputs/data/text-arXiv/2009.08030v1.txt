This paper investigates the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on the Chinese stock market crash risk.
We first estimate conditional skewness of the return distribution from the GARCH-S model as the
proxy of the equity market crash risk for the Shanghai Exchange Stock Market. Then, we
construct a fear index for COVID-19 using the data from Baidu Index. Our findings show that the
conditional skewness reacts negatively to daily growth in total confirmed cases, indicating that the
epidemic increases the crash risk of stock market. Furthermore, we find that the fear sentiment
also exacerbates the crash risk. In particular, the fear sentiment plays a significant role in the
impact of COVID-19 on the crash risk. When the fear sentiment among people is high, the stock
market crash risk is affected by the epidemic more seriously. Evidence from the daily deaths and
global cases shows the robustness.

1. Introduction
During the COVID-19 epidemic, there was a significant decline in stock market
returns, which has attracted the attention of many scholars recently. Previous studies
have mainly examined the impacts of COVID-19 on the return or volatility of the
stock market, and some conclusions have been supported by empirical evidence
(Baker et al. (2020), Al-Awadhi, Al-Saifi, Al-Awadhi and Alhamadi (2020), Phan and
Narayan (2020), Ashraf (2020), Kartal et al. (2020), Ramelli and Wagner (2020),
Zhang, Hu and Ji (2020a), Saeed and Ridoy (2020), Sharif, Aloui and Yarovaya
(2020)). Although the COVID-19 broken out earlier in the regional area of China’s
Hubei Province, this negative effects have applied the unprecedented pressures to the
global financial markets. In which, due to the comovements of global stock markets
(Wen, Yang and Zhou, 2019), the global equity plummeted, which was followed by a
spike of market volatility. In the same vein, Baker et al. (2020) draw the conclusion
that the level of market volatility in this time (March 2020) can be equivalent or even
surpassing in comparison with the previous crisis, namely October 1987 (Black
Monday) and December 2008 (Global financial crisis) and, before that, in late 1929
(Great Crash) and the early 1930s (Great Depression). Concomitantly, Schell et al.
(2020) also emphasized that this time is indeed different, implying that only the
COVID-19 exhibits the negative returns with the Public Health Risk Emergency of
International Concern (PHEIC) announcements. Therefore, the adverse effects of
COVID-19 pandemic on the stock markets are still being studied from different
perspectives. Motivated by these extant literature, this paper will focus on another
pivotal downside risk in the stock market during the epidemic: stock market crash risk
and investors sentiment in China. Notwithstanding the current literature between the
infectious disease outbreaks and stock market performance, our study does not only
quantify the stock market crash risk but also investigate the role of investors’
sentiments by using the data searching tools on the Baidu and the number of infected
cases (deaths) in terms of driving the potential risks. In doing so, our study is one of
2 / 27

the pioneers to shed a new light on how the coronavirus proxies and investors’
behaviors could predict the equity market crash risk on the onset of the pandemic.
In fact, during the coronavirus outbreak, the stock market has suffered a severe
shock, and the probability of the stock market crash risk is significantly higher than
usual. In the first three months of 2020 (59 trading days), there were six days with a
single-day crash of 2% or more. While in the past three years (730 trading days), the
total number of days to experience such a decline was only 21. Some scholars are
concerned about the stock market crash during the epidemic. For example, Mazur,
Dang and Vega (2020) discussed COVID-19 and the stock market crash, but they
defined the crash in terms of extreme returns and volatility.
The crash risk, measured by the conditional skewness in our paper, can capture
the negative asymmetry risk and the extreme downside risk in the stock market (Chen,
Hong and Stein (2001)). Academics have analyzed stock market crash risk from
different perspectives. For example, Chen, Hong and Stein (2001) undertake an
empirical investigation to forecast crash risk (skewness), both at firm and at whole
market levels. And concerning the crash risk at firm level, Kim, Li and Zhang (2011a),
Kim, Li and Zhang (2011b) have done a series of representative work.
This paper investigates the effects of COVID-19 on the stock market crash risk.
We first use the GARCH-S model to estimate the daily time-varying skewness of
stock returns, and use it as a measure of stock market crash risk. In the subsequent
empirical analysis, we not only analyzed the impact of the severity of the epidemic
(measured by the number of daily confirmed cases) on the crash risk, but also
discussed the impact of people's panic during the epidemic. We found that the more
severe the epidemic and the more people panic about the epidemic, the greater the
crash risk of the stock market. Furthermore, we further studied the interaction
between the severity of the epidemic and fear sentiment. We found that the fear
sentiment has contributed to the negative effect of the epidemic on the stock market
crash risk.

This paper contributes to the extant literature by several ways. First, as
mentioned above, we focus our research on the risk of stock market crashes, which
allows us to pay more attention to those asymmetric negative and extreme risks.
Second, we create a fear sentiment by using the Baidu index towards the COVID-19
pandemic to examine if panic for the epidemic will correlate with the market crash.
Finally, we investigate the role of fear sentiment in the impact of COVID-19 on the
stock market crash risk. More importantly, our findings carry some policy
implications. One of the most important policies is to alleviate the investors’ panic to
mitigate the equity market crash risk. The second preventive measure could be
considered as the way to communicate about the number of infected cases as well as
deaths. To recapitulate, our findings might provide the policymakers with the deep
understanding of how to response to and cope with the investors’ pessimism about the
equity markets in a timely and comprehensive manner during such a financial
downturn.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 acknowledges the
current literature while section 3 describes the data and methodology. Following this,
section 4 presents the empirical results of the impacts of COVID-19 on stock market
crash risk. Section 5 concludes.
2. Brief literature review
It is essential to construct the solid and sound theoretical framework how the
COVID-19 pandemic adversely influence the financial markets. Goodell (2020)
compares that the markets are likely to react with the pandemic in the same way with
the other forms of disasters such as catastrophic disasters (Gao et al., 2020) or
terrorism (Wang and Young, 2020). There is a common trait that investors’ risk
preferences or their mood towards these events might vary considerably, which means
an increase in fear-induced feelings. While the previous events were occurred in
specific region or area with the partial disruption, the existence of COVID-19
pandemic locked the travelling status as well as economic transactions in the global
4 / 27

scope. Hence, the effects of pandemic on the total economy will not only enormously
influence domestic demands but also completely limit the supply, which is expected
to dip the future cash flows of the firms. This phenomenon first manifests itself as the
public mood about the future pessimistic feelings.
The COVID-19 pandemic is considered as the unique public health crisis event in
terms of its global scope since the influenza pandemic in 1918. Thus, there are many
unknown perspectives which need to be examined. One of the biggest concerns is the
financial crashes. While Mazur et al. (2020) claimed that the financial market crash in
March 2020 was triggered by the government’s reactions. Interestingly, the negative
effects are more pronounced in some specific industries such as crude petroleum, real
estate, entertainment, and hospitality sectors. This paper also confirms what Mishkin
and White (2002) found. The equity market crash could results in a drop by 20-25%
in the main index during the previous crisis due to the sequence of panic selling. Thus,
our motivation is to examine the determinants including the investors’ sentiment and
the pandemic status could predict the equity market crash risk while Giglio et al.
(2020), Wen et al. (2019a), Wen et al. (2019b) and Zhang et al. (2020) reveal that
investors’ expectations with the short run might correlate with the stock market crash
risk. It is noticeable that the previous studies (Giglio et al., 2019; Giglio et al., 2020)
also confirm that the probability of equity market crash before the crisis is lower
because the investors tend to be more optimistic about stock market returns.
Notwithstanding the evident findings, the further investigation of COVID-19 is still
promising since we take no stance on whether the likelihood of market crash risk
would significantly change in the two sub-period, including before- and after- the
pandemic. Given the foregoing discussion and argument, we accordingly hypothesize
the following:
H1: The Chinese equity market crash risk in the COVID-19 pandemic is higher than
in the previous period.
To examine the first hypothesis, we divide our samples into two sub-periods and
5 / 27

employ the statistical test as well as the illustration. The aforementioned literature
(such as Giglio et al., 2019; Giglio et al., 2020; Gabaix, 2012; Wachter, 2013) would
be the sound and solid framework for our constructions of the first hypothesis.

H2: There is no relationship between investors’ sentiment and stock market crash on
the onset of COVID-19 pandemic.
Although there are a mounting literature examining how investors overreact or
underreact in the COVID-19 pandemic (see more at Schell et al., 2020; Aslam et al.,
2020; Yarovaya et al., 2020), it is still unanswered what drives the Chinese stock
market crash risk. It is marginally relevant to consider that the combination of
economic uncertainty and behavioral factors positively contributes to financial asset
crash risk (for example, Bitcoin (Kalyvas et al., 2020), Chinese stock market (Jin et
al., 2019; Luo and Zhang, 2019). Noticeably, the concern how the aforementioned
factors drive the stock market during the diseases period is still open. In doing so, we
use the two proxies such as the fear index for COVID-19 aggregating the data from
Baidu Index and the actual figures of pandemic situation to predict the changes in
stock market crash risk index, constructed by employing the GARCH-S. The
substitution of different proxies would be our alternative approach to check whether
our findings and results are robust or not.
Overall, the existing literature still has a gap for us to fulfill with two main folds. First,
answering the research question ‘How is the equity market crash risk before and after
the COVID-19 pandemic?’ would benefit to not only the practitioners to be cautious
about the extreme shocks in the market but also the understandings of empirical
evidence for academia. The second question needs to be answered is “What drives the
Chinese stock market crash risk? Do the investors’ fears and/or the current situation
of coronavirus statistical numbers matter the Chinese stock market crash risk?’.
Based on the above arguments, our corresponding questions are closely related to the
6 / 27

line of research on the financial markets’ reactions under the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, only few works so far have examined the effect of investors’ emotion,
especially fear sentiment, on systematic risk in emerging economies on the onset of
coronavirus outbreaks. The majority of extant studies only have kept their eyes on the
advanced markets; for example, the United States, or European markets while only a
scarcity of papers address the phenomenon in emerging economies, which also suffer
from the severity of downside in the COVID-19 outbreaks. Hence, our study would
shed a new light on how the level of Chinese stock market crash risk change in this
difficult time.
3. Data and methodology
3.1. COVID-19 related variables
The proxy we used in this paper to measure the severity of the COVID-19
epidemic is the logarithmic growth rate of daily confirmed cases (rCases). We also
construct an alternative variable using the logarithmic growth rate of daily deaths
(rDths) to run the robustness check. The data is retrieved from the CSMAR database.
We create a COVID-19 induced fear sentiment index (fearSent) utilizing the data
from the Baidu index following the idea of Da, Engelberg and Gao (2011). If the
searching volume of COVID-19 related keywords is high, it means people are fear or
even panic about the epidemic. Specifically, we define the fear index as the log of
searching volume plus one. Figure 1 displays the trend of the daily confirmed cases
and fear sentiment. Moreover, we set a dummy variable D_fear for fear index: if the
searching volume is greater than the median of the 2020 sample, the value of this
dummy is one, and zero otherwise.

3.2. Measuring stock market crash risk
Our market returns were collected from the value-weighted market return of
Shanghai A shares, used frequently in the extant literature (see more at Ashraf (2020),
Al-Awadhi et al. (2020)). To measure the crash risk of stock market, we follow the
work of Chen, Hong and Stein (2001), which associate it solely with the conditional
skewness of the market return. They calculate the six-month horizon skewness from
the daily returns, however, we use the GARCH-S (GARCH with skewness) model to
estimate the daily skewness.
rt     t ;  t ~  0,  2 

 t  ht1 2t ; t ~  0,1 ;  t I t 1 ~  0, ht 

Where rt is the value-weighted market return of Shanghai A shares,  t is the
residual and t is the standardized residual. I t 1 denotes the information set at the
8 / 27

period t. ht

is the conditional heteroscedasticity with a classical GARCH(1,1)

structure. st represents the conditional skewness process, and we specify it as both
autoregressive and dependent on lagged return shocks. To estimate the GARCH-S
model, following Leon, Rubio and Serna (2005), we use a Gram-Charlier series
expansion and truncate at the third moment. And it should be noted that, due to the
high non-linearity of the likelihood function, we use the starting values of parameters
estimated from the simple GARCH (1,1) model.
The market data we used is also from the CSMAR database and the sample
period in our paper is from January 1, 2017 to March 31, 2020. Table 1 provides the
market returns descriptive statistics of the whole sample and sub-samples, including
the unconditional skewnesses. We can see that the skewness of the whole sample is
-0.71, while during the COVID-19 epidemic (January 2020 – March 2020), this value
is -1.47, compared to -0.30 in the 2017-2019 sample period.

Notes: We divide our sample into two sub-samples consisting of the prior- and post- the COVID-19 pandemic.

When looking at the statistical evidence, we do not reject the mean difference
between two sub-samples including before (0.0002) – after (-0.0016) in Table 1 (t-stat
= 1.25,

= 0.211). It implies that there is no difference in market return when the

COVID-19 pandemic happened. However, with regard to the skewness index,
representing the market crash risk, we observe the significant difference in mean
9 / 27

between two periods. To be more precise, the level of market crash in 2020 is
significantly higher than the previous period (t-stat = 2.50,

= 0.01). Therefore, we

do not reject the first hypothesis, implying the higher extreme volatility in the Chinese
equity market when having the COVID-19 pandemic.
Table 2 further reports the estimation results of GARCH-S model. As expected,
the results indicate a significant presence of conditional skewness. Specifically, the
coefficient of lagged skewness is positive and significant (0.148 with a t-statistic
58.079), indicating that the skewness is persistent and high conditional skewness is
followed by high conditional skewness. We also find the coefficient of the shock to
skewness is positive and significant (0.036 with a t-statistic 15.373), which is similar
with that in the variance case. In general, the majority of coefficients are significant,
implying the appropriateness of our models when using GARCH-S to estimate the
skewness of the market return.

Figure 2 presents the trajectory of conditional skewness, from which we can
visually see that the skewness is time-varying and clustering. In particular, there are a
large number of cases where the skewness is negative, indicating that the crash risk at
these points is high. The largest negative value of skewness occurred during the
COVID-19 outbreak in our sample period, that is, on February 4, 2020, and it reached
-0.76.

3.3. Model specifications
We conduct a simple time series model to examine the relationship between
COVID-19 outbreak and stock market crash risk. Our dependent variable is the crash
risk, i.e., conditional skewness calculated from the estimation results of GARCH-S
model. Due to the persistence of skewness, we add the lagged skewness term in our
model. The benchmark specification of the regression model is specified as:
Skewt  c    Skewt 1    rCasest 1 + t

(Eq. 2)

where Skewt is the conditional skewness derived from the GARCH-S model, and
11 / 27

rCases

is the logarithmic growth rate of daily confirmed cases. In addition, c is

constant term,

and

are the coefficients of the one-period lagged term and the

logarithmic growth rate of infected cases, respectively. Finally,

is the error term in

the estimation.
In our paper, we also consider whether the COVID-19 induced fear sentiment
index (fearSent) affects the crash risk. And thus, we estimate the following model:
Skewt  c    Skewt 1    fearSentt + t

(Eq. 3)

In which, Equation 3 also has similar denotations, which are presented above.
We only substitute the rCase by fearSent to consider how investors’ sentiment could
predict the stock market crash risk. In order to further investigate the interaction effect
between the daily confirmed cases and the fear sentiment, we also add the interaction
term in our model. Similarly, we choose that ,

represent the coefficients for fear

sentiment and interaction term while the other components in equation 4 are the same
as the previous equations. Our model specification is as follows:
Skewt  c    Skewt 1    rCaset 1 +  fearSentt +  rCaset 1  fearSentt + t (Eq. 4)

We also employ the Granger causality test to detect the causal relationship
between the crash risk of the stock market and the fear sentiment. The model for
Granger causality test is specified as follows:
p

p

i 1

i

Skewt  c1    i Skewt i    i fearSent t i   1t
p

p

i 1

j 1

faerSent t  c2   i Skewt i    i fearSent t  j   2t

(Eq. 5)

(Eq. 6)

where p is the largest lag order which is determined through the VAR model and
the Bayesian information criterion. The hypotheses tests for Granger causality are
presented in Table 6. Finally, in our robustness section, we use the alternative proxy
12 / 27

for the growth rate of confirmed cases as well as death cases to predict the equity
market crash risk. In addition, due to the integration of the financial markets, we also
run the further estimations to predict the equity market crash risk with the number of
infected cases and deaths in the global scope. Our justification is that the Chinese
investors do not only react with the local information but also the worldwide news,
which might drive their behaviors to the market crash risk.
Skew t  c    Skew t 1    r GlobalCase s t   t

(Eq. 7)

Skewt  c    Skewt 1    r (GlobalCase s ) t    fearSent t 1
   r (GlobalCase s )  fearSent t 1   t

(Eq. 8)

The equation (2) and (4) are changed into equation (7) and (8) respectively. By doing
that, we could examine how our determinants are robust. Our findings will be
illustrated and summarized in the following sections.
4. Findings and results
4.1. COVID-19 and stock market crash risk
The estimation results of model (2) are reported in Table 3. In column (1), we
can see that the coefficient of rCasest 1 is negative and significant. It is consistent
with our exception that the COVID-19 outbreak has a negative impact on stock
market crash risk. This result also reflects the reality well. With the rapid spread of the
epidemic, the value of listed companies has generally been affected, and the stock
market has entered a period of obvious downturn, accompanied by large declines or
even crashes. Surprisingly, there is no predictive power of the other lagged terms
including rCases(t-2) and rCases(t-3) for the changes in market crash risk. Thus, this
finding emphasizes the role of information, particularly the number of cases, in the
previous trading day on the market shocks. In terms of explanatory power, the
R-squared in these markets are around 7 per cent indicating that the lagged variables
13 / 27

of logarithmic growth rate of daily confirmed cases can be explained by changes in
market skewness, representing the stock market crash risk.

respectively. The t-statistics are presented in the brackets. Table 3 summarizes the
estimated results for the Equation 2.

Our findings also confirm the extant literature that the stock markets are likely to
be sensitive to the information about the growth in number of confirmed cases as
compared to the growth in number of deaths (Ashraf, 2020; Albulescu, 2020). Thus,
apart from the United States market, the new infection cases reported at Chinese level
amplify the Chinese market crash risk.
4.2. Does fear sentiment matter?
We consider the role of COVID-19 induced fear sentiment in this section. The
14 / 27

motivation is that people's panic about the epidemic may remain at a high level,
although the number of confirmed cases at this time is not very large. For example, as
early as January 20, 2020, Academician Zhong Nanshan publicly confirmed the
human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 on TV. A few days later, on January 23,
the central government of China announced the lockdown of Wuhan. Although the
number of confirmed cases publicly disclosed at that time was still at a low level,
people quickly fell into panic. That is to say, the fear sentiment may have an impact
on the stock market ahead of the impact from the confirmed cases.
The results of model (3) are shown in Table 4. We use the variable fearSent in
the results of the first two columns. In addition, we also use the dummy variable,
d_fear, to re-estimate model (3), and the results are displayed in the last two columns.
We can see that all the coefficients about fear sentiment are negative and significant,
indicating that COVID-19 induced fear sentiment will cause a significant crash in
stock market.

While Duan et al. (2020) employed the textual analysis of 6.3 million messages
on social media to conclude that the Chinese stock market is likely to overact with the
growth sentiments, our findings are also consistent with the aforementioned study by
using the construction methods of Da, Engelberg and Gao (2011) with Baidu
searching engine. Interestingly, Burgraf et al. (2020) applied the same method to
indicate that the Bitcoin market significantly changes when the investors’ sentiments
fluctuate. However, one of the most novel point from our study is to examine where
the fear sentiment stands in over the pandemic. It is noticeable that the Chinese stock
market crash worsens when incorporating the fear sentiment. Our results are robust
when controlling the other variables such as the lagged term of skewness (the
previous term of market crash risk), the number of infected cases. To sum up, our
findings do reject the second hypothesis, which means that there exists the
relationship between investor sentiment and Chinese market crash risk during the
COVID-19 outbreaks. Although the extant literature confirms this linkage in the
normal market condition, our study also sheds a new light on this relationship on the
onset of pandemic, one unique event shaking the investors’ sentiments.
4.3. The interaction effect between COVID-19 and the fear sentiment
The above results show that both daily confirm cases and fear sentiment can
increase the risk of stock market crashes. In this section, we try to further explore the
inner links between these impacts to the underlying mechanisms.
Table 5 gives the results about the interaction effect between daily cases and fear
sentiment. The coefficients of the interaction terms are negative and show their
significance. It means that fear sentiment will further amplify the negative impact of
confirmed cases on stock market crash risk. In other words, because of fear, the
negative impact of COVID has been exacerbated. It shows the importance of

Notes: ***, **, * represent statistical significance at 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively. The t-statistics are

use the variable, Fear Sentiment, and in column (2), the dummy variable, D_Fear Sentiment, is used. The
total observations are 787 over our research period.

It is important to consider the existence of interaction term in our regression due
to two main reasons. First, the investors’ fear exhibit the dynamics pattern with the
fatality ratio. It means that when the number of infected cases increase, the investors’
sentiments might be induced by the fears. Second, the feelings of fear would mitigate
the risky behaviors on the onset of pandemic. This might lead to the decrease in
infected cases. Therefore, looking at the interaction variable constructed by the
17 / 27

aforementioned components would offer some insights, especially how this factor
increases or decreases the equity market crash risk.
There are three main conclusion which could be drawn from the regression in
Table 5. First, the interaction variable increases the likelihood of market crash risk at
1% significance level. This can be exemplified that both factors amplify the negative
impact on the equity market shocks. Second, our results are robust although we
substitute the fear emotion with continuous or binary variable. It does not only
emphasize the dynamics pattern but also confirms the existing role of investors’
emotion on the systematic risk. Third, to compare the previous regression in Table 3
and 4, the explanatory level, captured by R2, is substantially improved. It implies that
the interaction variable could positively contribute to the explanatory feature of the
changes in the equity market crash risk.
One of the worth noting points is that our existing findings mainly stem from the
correlation. We are cautious about confirming the sound tone for causal relationship
before obtaining any statistical evidence. In doing so, we perform the Granger causal
test to examine whether the fear emotion could cause the market risk crash or not. Of
course, the opposite direction is also examined.
4.4 Granger causality test
Table 6 reports the results of the Granger causality test. To examine the
hypothesis of each causality, we conduct the F-test. As we can see from the table 6,
the fearSent is the Granger cause of Skew which implies the fear sentiment causes the
crash risk of stock market. On the contrary, the crash risk of stock market is not the
Granger causes of the fear sentiment.

Notes: ***, **, * represent statistical significance at 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively. The null
hypothesis for Granger causality is summarized as ‘fearSent does not cause the Granger causality to Skew’
(fearSent→Skew) and the remaining hypothesis is that ‘Skew does not cause the Granger causality to
fearSent’ (Skew → fearSent).

Interestingly, we only observe the mono-direction in the Granger causality
between fear sentiments and the market crash risk. To be more precise, the fear
sentiment is the factor which causes the changes in the market crash risk while we do
not have any evidence in the opposite direction. In doing so, we come into conclusion
that the investors’ attitudes towards the uncertainties in terms of fear, macroeconomics
and microeconomics will be stimulus to the risk of market crash risk. Our findings
also confirm the extant literature of fear and stock market dynamics (such as Bitcoin
market, Chen et al. (2020); the financial markets, Sharif et al. (2020); energy market,
Salisu et al. (2020)). By examining the causal relationship, our policy implication
would be focused on how to alleviate the investors’ panic to maintain the stability of
the market. This is important, indeed.
4.5 Robustness checks
An alternative proxy to measure the severity of the COVID-19 epidemic is the growth
rate of daily deaths (rDeaths). We use it to redo our empirical analysis and the results
are shown in Table 6. In general, the results are consistent with the previous.
Furthermore, we substitute the number of global cases for that of the cases of China
for another robustness checks since the people in China does not just pay attention to
the progress of COVID-19 in China but also to the global progress. Table 7 and Table
8 show the results of the corresponding regressions, which illustrates that our
conclusions remain robust. Thus, we could draw the policy implications from what we
19 / 27

found from the previous results.

5. Conclusions
This paper has examined the relationship between the COVID-19 and the stock
market crash risk. First, we confirm that COVID-19 will increase the likelihood of the
stock market crash risk. It not only means that it will bring about a decline in stock
market returns, but also means aggravating the negative symmetry of stock market
returns and increasing the possibility of extreme downturns in stock prices. Second,
we find that even when the number of confirmed cases is not very large, people's fear
about the virus will increase the crash risk of the stock market.
It reminds us that preventing the spread of panic during the epidemic is helpful
in reducing the crash risk. Finally, we also find that fear sentiment can not only
directly increase the crash risk, it will also boost the negative impact of COVID-19 on
the stock market crash risk. Thus, our study also draws two main policy implications.
First, the closer observation from lawmakers on the financial markets with the
dynamics of fear and the number of cases is necessary. It is due to the fact that the
governor could manage how to immediately support the market when the shake of
fear is overwhelming. By doing this, the market crash risk might be managed in some
urgent cases. Second, investors are likely to be sensitive with not only the local
information (Chinese domestic infected cases or deaths) but also the global news.
Therefore, the clear and timely communication regarding the COVID-19 pandemic
would bring the effective prediction to the market. More importantly, both investors
and governor might be cautious about the market crash risk when the number of cases
(or deaths) significantly rise. Then, the hedging or safe-haven strategies could be
implemented such as the suggestions of studies of Colon et al. (2020), Colon and
McGee (2020).
