While examining the association between the Case Fatality Ratio (CFR)
and cumulative number of COVID-19 infections in this journal, Kenyon1
recently came across various difficulties in estimating the CFR. One of
these was addressed by Baud and colleagues2, who pointed out that the
CFR (number of reported deaths divided by reported cases) ignores the
time delay between incubation and death. Various problems3 with their approach have been identified, but a concrete solution is unclear. While we
agree that time lag plays an important role, it is overestimated by Baud and
coworkers2, whereas reported CFR values4 ignore time lag completely. We
find that either of these approaches introduces a spurious time dependence
that severely distorts the magnitude and true meaning of the CFR. Instead,
a suitably corrected CFR is far more useful as an indicator of COVID-19

fatality, because it turns out to be constant in time for many countries, as
we show.

The CFR is unfavorably compared with the Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR)26

of deaths over total actual infections, often because asymptomatic cases

do not contribute to it, unless identified by testing. The IFR is important,
but practically impossible to measure, due to lack of data for the denominator, which requires widespread, continuous random testing7.

The CFR (only including reported cases) may have its uses in estimating
fatalities1. Assuming random testing is very limited4, the majority of reported cases have developed symptoms severe enough to seek medical assistance; these individuals are far more likely to die from the disease than
asymptomatic cases8, which would go undetected in the absence of testing.
In this sense, the CFR is a meaningful measure of fatality risk among
symptomatic individuals. This begs the question whether CFR versus time
might be roughly constant for each country, at least during a period of
fixed social distancing measures. This constant value would be different
for each country, because of differing age distributions, mortality being a
strongly increasing function of age8, and possibly other factors.

Figure1: The case for a constant CFR. (a) Italy deaths (red) and cases (blue). (b) as in (a) but
with deaths scaled by a factor of 7. (c) as in (a) but with deaths scaled by 7 and shifted back by 4
days. The result is a constant CFR=1/7. (d) Various estimates of CFR versus time (March 20—May
20, 2020) for Italy. Orange: reported value4 ignoring time delay (Δt=0). Black dashed line: our prediction of cCFR=0·14. Red: Corrected CFR with deaths shifted back by our predicted cΔt=4 days.
Green: Using Baud et al. method1 with deaths shifted back by Δt=14 days.

At first glance, this hypothesis is not supported by the COVID-19 data4.
Most countries have an increasing, and some a decreasing CFR that eventually levels off to a constant.

To test the constant CFR hypothesis, we started with a hard-hit country,
Italy, plotted deaths and reported cases versus time (figure 1a), and observed that multiplying deaths by roughly a factor of 7, made the two
graphs almost the same (figure 1b), except for a shift Δt=4 days; after
compensating for which they became nearly indistinguishable (figure 1c),
implying a CFR≈1/7=0·14 that remains virtually constant within 3% of
0·14.
Baud and coworkers2 used a lag of 14 days, representing symptom onset to
death. Instead we feel that the time lag Δt should reflect time from reporting to death. Delays from onset to reporting do occur5,9. In Singapore these
delays had a mean of a week10 and could exceed two weeks. Moreover, delays in reporting bring delays in critical medical care, hence may accelerate death. By increasing the time from onset to reporting, such factors decrease the time lag Δt from reporting to death, so we might expect Δt to be
much less than 14 days, but uncertainty is introduced. Here, instead of arbitrarily picking CFR and Δt, or using estimates from a different location5,
we let the data decide. Data-driven predictions11 of epidemic metrics are

promising. We use a simple data-driven approach to find the right constant
values, cCFR and cΔt. Simply put, we choose these values to be the ones
that minimize the root mean square deviation between cases and deaths
versus time, with deaths multiplied by cCFR and shifted back by cΔt. See
the Appendix for details. This gives cΔt=4 days for Italy. Shifting deaths
back in time by this cΔt, then dividing by cases, yields a virtually constant
CFR versus time (red curve, figure 1d), equal to cCFR≈0·14 (black
dashed line, figure 1d) within a few percent. The statement “14% of reported cases die after four days” remains closer to the truth for much
longer than any analogous statement regarding the reported, variable CFR
that nearly doubles its value in two months (orange curve figure 1d).

This procedure works for many countries (figure 2), producing a different
cCFR and cΔt for each, but also for the entire world: cCFR≈0·08, cΔt=3
days (black dashed line, figure 2), but a nearly constant corrected CFR for
all cases considered.

The reported4 CFR (orange curve, figure 1d), which ignores time lag, increases with time and underestimates Italy’s cCFR by a time-dependent
amount. Baud et al. approach, shifting deaths back by Δt=14 days2 (green
curve, figure 1d) overestimates Italy’s cCFR and decreases with time.

In summary, by allowing for an initially unknown time lag between case
reporting and death, we find that many countries, and the entire world, exhibit a corrected CFR that is essentially constant during a long period of
imposed social distancing. This value can be estimated long before the full
evolution of the pandemic, hence it is useful for early prediction of fatalities, in situations where extensive random testing is not available.

Our approach yields CFR versus time that is remarkably close to a constant for each country.

SUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIX
We explain some details of our approach.
Motivation. Here we use Italy as an example. Suppose the number of total
deaths reported by day t is D(t), and the number of total cases reported by
day t is C(t). Then the usual definition of (reported) CFR is

CFR(t) = D(t)/C(t). Typically, this has the shape of the orange curve in
figure 1d, and for Italy it roughly doubles its size from March 20 to May
20. On the other hand, we observed that for many countries, the two
curves D(t) and C(t) versus t (figure 1a) appeared similar, so multiplying
deaths by a suitable constant factor might make them roughly equal to cas-

es. When this is done it yields figure 1b where we plot C(t) and 7D(t) together. The two curves appear to be shifted by about 4 days. Shifting the
death curve back by 4 days gives D(t+4). The shift reflects the typical value of time delay between reporting and death. Here it means that a case
that dies at day t+4 has been reported about 4 days earlier at day t.
After we shift the rescaled death curve back by 4 days, namely 7D(t+4), it
becomes almost indistinguishable with the reported case curve C(t), figure
1c, so we have C(t)≈7D(t+4) or equivalently

D(t + 4)/C(t) ≈ 1/7 ≈ 1.4
The left hand side of this for the Italy data7 is nearly constant, and stays
with 3% of 0·14 from April 20 onwards.
This means an essentially constant corrected cCFR~0·14, corresponding to
a time delay Δt=4 days. Of course here the factor of 7 and the time delay
of 4 days were chosen by trial and error, so we next describe a more objective, unbiased method of obtaining them.
Algorithm for Finding cCFR AND cΔt. Rescale the death curve by a
constant factor K and shift it backwards in time by an integer constant z
(days) to obtain the graph of the function KD(t + z). We provide a systematic way of automatically finding the values of K and z that bring the
two curves ( C(t) versus t and KD(t + z) versus t) as close as possible,
without recourse to trial and error. We recall that a measure of their difference is the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD).This is the square root, of

the mean, of the squared difference between the values of C(t) and
KD(t+z), over all times considered:

RMSD(K, z) =

N

1
[C(t) − KD(t + z)]]2
∑N
t=1

The sum is from day 1 to day N. Here we typically choose day 1 as March
20, 2020, by which time government restrictions were in place in most
countries7 and the pandemic has evolved past the initial stage (of very
small case and death numbers). Day N is May 20, 2020 (final date of data
used).
Since C(t) and D(t) are known functions from data7, RMSD reduces to a
function of K and z, and we find its minimum. We let cCFR and cΔt be the
values of K and z respectively that minimize the RMS deviation. We then
plot the quantity D(t + cΔt)/C(t) versus t, (red curve, figure 1d) We observe that this quantity is much closer to the constant value cCFR than the
reported ratio CFR(t) = D(t)/C(t) (orange curve, figure 1d). For Italy, it
remains within 3% of cCFR, for the world within 10% of cCFR=0·08 after
April 1, 2020, whereas the reported ratio CFR(t) = D(t)/C(t) for Italy increases from 0·08 to 0·014 during the same time.
We have tested this approach for 8 countries (color curves figure 2), and
the entire world (dashed balck line, figure 2). The CFR for each of these is
close to a constant in the time period shown (April and May) after the epidemic developed beyond the early stage, and after government-imposed

restrictions were in place by mid-March7 in most countries. At the early
stages when cases and deaths are very few, the CFR can exhibit oscillations and artificial spikes due to back-shifting leading to a small divisor
problem.
Significance of cΔt. Here cΔt is the average time delay between case reports and deaths. This equals the difference between the onset-to-death delay and the reporting delay (onset to reporting). Since reporting delays9,10
can exceed a week, this explains why typical values are less than the 14
day onset-to-death period assumed by Baud and coworkers1. In the case of
South Korea the large cΔt=20 days seems to be due to the extensive random testing that reported many cases long before they developed noticeable symptoms. In that case cΔt can be larger than the lag between onset of
symptoms and death.
