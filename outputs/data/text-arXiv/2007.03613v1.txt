Backg o nd and Mo i a ion
Due to the COVID 19 pandemic that set in in the middle of the semester, most of the IITs and
other institutions from across India and the world switched to an online mode for completing the
semester. Since then, many different institutions from across the world have been discussing ways
and means to make online education effective, via various means, such as webinars, talks and
short workshops. However, a general observation has been that there is a lack of data on online
education, particularly in the Indian context. Anticipating this, we decided to conduct a pan IIT
survey on online education and compiled two sets of questionnaires one each for faculty
members and students in discussion with the members of the pan IIT group on Online Pedagogy
https://www.paniit onlinepedagogy researchgroup.net/ , that has been formed for conducting
research on the broad area of online education. The current survey has been steered by IIT
Dharwad and IIT Jammu along with the members of the pan IIT group on online pedagogy.
The survey data was collected from 5th May 2020 to 25th May 2020. We received about 11,890
and 840 responses from students and faculty members, respectively. About 82 and 86 of the
respondents were males among the students and faculty surveys, respectively. In the following,
we present and discuss the survey responses pertaining to various aspects of online education. An
infographic representation of the survey responses may be found in Appendix. We note that the
survey conducted was a broad survey, covering various broad aspects of online education.
However, a fine grained survey may be required to obtain an in depth understanding of specific
aspects, such as on how to handle lab courses and carry out assessments.

Role of Re iden ial Camp e
Right at the outset, we stress that the residential campuses of IITs contribute to the overall growth of
an individual in several ways, which are almost impossible to replicate via online education. For
instance, the leadership roles in mess, gymkhana, club and other student body activities, where
students spend a significant amount of time, cannot be emulated in an online educational setup.
Presence of peers is one of the most important aspects of student life. Naturally, about 70 of
students were poorly motivated to study, especially due to the absence of peers, according to the
current survey. Also, about 38 of the faculty members feel that online education with physical
classrooms will become prominent in the future and 27 of the faculty members feel that online
education will not be prominent in future. Only 18 of the faculty members feel that online
education will take over the classroom education in future. This information indicates that the online
education will not and should not fully replace the brick and mortar classroom education.
However, online education will be an important ingredient in education, including undergraduate
and graduate curriculum, continuing education programmes and corporate training.

For conducting a decent online education, the students and instructors are required to have a
basic set of devices, such as desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones for preparing and
presenting lectures, assignments and lab material for instructors and to attend lectures
synchronous or asynchronous , read books, solve assignments and lab sessions and perform
simulations for students. Only about 62 of the students had used laptops/desktops, and about
56 had used smartphones with about 23 using both . The main reasons why the students did
not have access to laptops include the following:
x

They did not own one may be because of economic problems .

x

They could not bring it home from the school, as students were given very short notice to
vacate the campus and there was no clarity on whether the classes will be held online.

The main challenges faced due to the above include the following:
x

Those who did not have a laptop/desktop, faced significant challenges in learning,
especially in completing assignments, labs and projects.

x

They did not have access to hardcopy of books as they were away from their institute
libraries. In addition, they could not download and read the freely available online software
and material/references, respectively. Even those who had laptops/desktops, many could
not access the material/references as they were not open source/free.

There were no questions asked to the instructors about the availability of the computing devices,
as it is highly likely that they have access to them.

Connec i i
Seamless internet connectivity is indispensable for online education. Two main options for
establishing the connectivity include wired or wireless internet connection.
The survey responses show that only about 20 of the students had stable and good quality internet
connection for most of the time. About 80 of the students used mobile data from 3 service
providers, namely, Jio, Airtel and Vodafone, which provide 3G/4G services. The connection might
have been unstable as mobile data is by nature flickering, especially in remote places with less
densely spaced base stations. In contrast, only 7 of the instructors said they did not have a decent
internet connection, as most faculty members stayed in campuses with dedicated networks, and
even those who were away would get paid for a telephone/broadband plan.
Hence, not having a good connectivity was one of the major issues among the students.

In e ac i e Engagemen in Online Cla e
About 60 of the instructors felt that lack of real time interaction is the biggest issue in online
education. In the similar lines, about 50 of the students were unable to ask real time questions due
to technology limitation/lack of knowledge to use the options to raise hand etc. About 50 of the
faculty members want to increase the real time interaction in the next online class they teach. About
58 of the students felt that online education can be improved making them interactive using
technology.
It is interesting to note that more students feel that the online education can be
improved by providing better quality audio/video 74 of the students and giving written/typed
notes 61 of the students , than by having interactive classes only 58 of the students .

Mode of In

c ion

The instruction was carried out both in the synchronous and asynchronous modes. About 45 of
the faculty members conducted classes in a synchronous mode mainly via Zoom and Google
Meet and about 42 of the instructors conducted classes in an asynchronous mode. In the
synchronous mode, the instructors asked for students feedback explicitly, as it was difficult to
decipher it through non verbal feedback of the students. In the asynchronous mode, about 26
of the instructors recorded handwritten slides/notes via mobile phones.
More than 55 of the students had online classes for less than 5 hours in the synchronous
mode. Only about 40 of the students were able to attend more than 50 of online classes
without any difficulty. The major difficulties faced were unclear audio/video 61
and
annoying video buffering 56 . Clearly, this is due to the fact that the majority of the students
had difficulty in accessing good quality internet data. In the asynchronous mode, about 45 of
the students viewed recorded lectures for less than 5 hours. Only 25 of the students were able
to view recorded classes without difficulty. About 50 of the students were unable to download
the material shared with them. Other problems included unclear audio and videos and unclear
explanation by the instructors.
About 47 , 14 and 40 of the instructors prefer online education only in synchronous, only in
asynchronous and both the modes, respectively. On the other hand, 20 , 28 and 55 of the
students prefer online education only in synchronous, only in asynchronous and both the modes,
respectively. This may be because, from the instructor perspective, the preparation time and
time to achieve perfection, if obsessed about it for a synchronous class is shorter than that for an
asynchronous class and the synchronous mode is to be more interactive compared to the
asynchronous mode. However, from the student perspective, in a synchronous class, they do
not get to exploit the self paced learning aspect of the online class. Moreover, in case of poor
internet connection, they may not even be able to decipher what the instructor is speaking in
the first place, let alone understand it.

P epa edne
About 74 of the faculty members did not have prior experience of conducting fully online courses.
Other 26 faculty members had given courses like NPTEL/SWAYAM. However, About 88 of
the faculty members had medium to high preparedness for conducting classes online of some form.
This may be because even in the in campus teaching, except lecture delivery and exams, other
aspects assignments, sharing material etc. are done online. Moreover, it is interesting to note that
about 80 of the instructors satisfaction level was medium to very high. However, they want to
improve by making online education more interactive.
On the other hand, more than 60 of the students were under prepared for the online classes.
Due to the short notice and uncertainty, they had not carried books, notes, laptops etc. The books
were not available online for easy access. Due to this, about 46 of the students had difficulty in
completing the assignments. About 18 of the students had difficulty in completing assignments as
they did not have the required software installed in their computer.

A e men
About 46
of the instructors did not conduct any assessment. 27
of them gave
open book/open internet exams and 12 conducted viva voce exams. Others conducted online
proctored exams, term paper presentations etc. When asked about the suggestions on
assessment, about 59 of the instructors felt that the assessment should include multiple
components, such as quizzes, assignments, course projects and classroom questions. About 32 of
the instructors suggested conducting limited time open book/internet exams and viva voce exams,
only about 28 suggested online proctored traditional exams. More or less a similar trend may be
observed in the students responses too. About 61 felt that no exams should be conducted. 41
and 17 of the students respectively felt that open book/internet exams and viva voce exams
should be conducted. Only 11
suggested conducting remotely proctored exams. It is
interesting to note that both the instructors and the students indicate that we should move away
from the traditional assessment techniques, such as conducting proctored exams. Hence,
challenges remain in finding a reliable, robust and transparent method of conducting assessment.
New methods need to be proposed, experimented and improved.

Role of Teaching A i an

TA

About 88 of the students did not interact with the TAs. In the similar lines, 36 of the instructors felt
that the contribution of the TAs has been lower during the online classes. These numbers clearly
show that the TAs were under utilized. When trained properly, they may help in taking the load of
post processing of content that may be required for asynchronous classes recall that only 14 of the
instructors preferred asynchronous mode, but 28 of the students wanted classes in asynchronous
mode .

Labo a o Cla e
About 68 of the classes conducted by the instructors did not have any lab component. 10 of
them who had software based labs conducted them. However, about 3 of them could not conduct
the software based labs due to unavailability of off campus licenses. About 11 of the courses
required physical labs and hence they could not be conducted. Interestingly, 2 of the instructors
transformed their physical lab to a simulation based lab and conducted them. When it comes to
projects, only 27 of the students had no difficulty in executing them. The difficulties were the
following: 28 of the students had projects that required physical lab access, 24 required
software, which was not available, and 29 could not access reference material that was required
for their projects. These responses show that the laboratories could not be conducted online,
especially when it involves physical equipment, in almost all the major core disciplines such as
aerospace, civil, electrical and mechanical engineering. Finally, among about 1300 PhD students
who responded, about 54 could not carry out their lab experiments and research online at all.

Challenge in Wo king f om Home
The main challenge in working from home for the instructors was lack of ergonomically designed
office spaces 52 . Other problems faced were disturbance due to kids seeking constant attention
34
and noise from TV, neighbours etc. 28 . Similarly, lack of study rooms, noise from family
members, TV and neighbours/street vendors were the main challenges for the students. Due to
these, about 72 of the students had lower productivity at home and about 70 of the students had
low to medium motivation levels to study at home.

In this part, we mention insights from an initial correlation analysis that was conducted.
● Download speed positively correlates with experience of male students/ UG students and
motivation level of PhD students. Upload speed does not seem to have any positive
correlation with anything except having negative correlation with experience of male
participants.
● Recorded classes motivate UG students in general. But it has a negative correlation with the
experience of male students but positive correlation with the experience of female students.
● Live classes do not motivate students in general but have high positive correlation with the
experience of students.
● Heavy loads of assignments do not motivate boys but have no impact on females. With boys
motivation, it has a negative correlation. Heavy loads of assignments do not significantly
impact girls motivation.
● Heavy load of assignments has a highly positive correlation with experience of girls. Low load of
assignment has high correlation with boys motivation but does not correlate with motivation of
girls but it has positive correlation with the experience of both boys and girls.

Concl ion
The online education has several advantages, such as self paced learning, any time and any place
learning. However, efforts are needed to improve online education. The starting point is to improve
the availability of computing/streaming devices and enabling good internet connectivity among
the students. The next step is to prepare decent quality content and deliver it to students here
majority of the faculty members and students prefer a combination of synchronous and
asynchronous modes. Lack of real time interaction is also an issue both among instructors and
faculty members. Unavailability of textbooks, reference material and software are also big
challenges as many students could not complete their assignments, labs and projects due to this.
Lack of a campus like environment at home is also a serious issue in online education. From the
survey, it is clear that addressing the above issues is critical for making online education a success.
Overall, it therefore appears challenging to visualise online education replacing classroom
education for technical education at this point in time. However, it could certainly supplement
regular classroom education for our main offerings, such as BTech, MTech and MS/PhD programs
which will still have to continue in regular mode. Nevertheless, with improvements in technology
and its accessibility, high quality online education is expected to become pervasive.
