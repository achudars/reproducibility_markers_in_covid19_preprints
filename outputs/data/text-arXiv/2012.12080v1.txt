Abstract—The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented
levels of disruption to the local and regional transportation
networks throughout the United States, especially the Motor
City—Detroit. That was mainly a result of swift restrictive
measures such as statewide quarantine and lock-down orders
to confine the spread of the virus and flatten-the-curve along
with a natural reaction of the population to the rising number
of COVID-19-related cases and deaths. This work is driven by
analyzing five types of real-world data sets from Detroit related
to: traffic volume, daily cases, weather, social distancing index,
and crashes from January 2019 to June 2020. The primary goal
is figuring out the impacts of COVID-19 on the transportation
network usage (traffic volume) and safety (crashes) for the City
of Detroit, exploring the potential correlation between these
diverse data features, and determining whether each type of
data (e.g., traffic volume data) could be a useful factor in the
confirmed-cases prediction. In addition, early future prediction of
COVID-19 rates can be a vital contributor to live-saving advanced
preventative and preparatory responses. In order to achieve this
goal, a deep learning model was developed using long shortterm memory networks to predict the number of confirmed
cases within the next one week. The model demonstrated a
promising prediction result with a coefficient of determination
(R2 ) of up to approximately 0.91. Moreover, in order to provide
statistical evaluation measures of confirmed-case prediction and
to quantify the prediction effectiveness of each type of data,
the prediction results of six feature groups are presented and
analyzed. Furthermore, six essential observations with supporting
evidence and analyses are presented. Those will be helpful for
decision-makers to take specific measures that aid in preventing
the spread of COVID-19 and protect public health and safety.
The goal of this paper is to present a proposed approach which
can be applied, customised, adjusted, and replicated for analysis
of the impact of COVID-19 on a transportation network and
prediction of the anticipated COVID-19 cases using a similar data
set obtained for other large cities in the USA or from around
the world.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), commonly
known as COVID-19, has spread rapidly across the globe.
As of July 28, 2020, over 16 million confirmed cases and
650 thousand deaths had been reported worldwide (WHO
Situation Report-190, 2020) [1]; meanwhile, the United States
is one of the most affected nations in the world, with more

than 4 million confirmed cases and 149 thousand deaths. This
tragic spread of COVID-19 nationally has resulted in disparate
impacts across states and cities.
To slow the progression of COVID-19 and limit fatalities,
public officials throughout Michigan had published a series
of government directives that have been changed over time,
starting with voluntary requests for stay-at-home and restrictions on large public gatherings, and then, statewide quarantine
and lock-down orders. Nonetheless, essential travel activities
continue to take place across Detroit, such as people’s access
to daily supplies, medical services, and other basic necessities
of welfare and safety. These government directives inevitably
affect various forms of travel activities and then impact transportation across Detroit significantly [2].
Our work is based on the hypothesis that the objective,
reliable and continuous transportation data can reflect the
degree of social distancing, i.e., the possibility of social
activities and interpersonal communication to a certain extent,
while many previous works provide the evidence proving that
the social distancing measures enacted have led to control of
COVID-19 [3]–[5]. Therefore, we believe that traffic data can
provide a basis for the current and incoming pandemic status,
and it is meaningful to explore the changes in traffic patterns
during the COVID-19 pandemic for a specific city.
In addition, crash-related information, such as total number
of daily crashes, severity, and crash type can indirectly reflect
traffic conditions [6]–[8]. Since one of the focus points of this
work is to explore the correlation between traffic volume data
and the outbreak of COVID-19, we also collected and analyzed
crash data from Detroit to identify the impacts of crash-related
information on the confirmed-cases prediction.
Through our literature review, an abundance of studies
pointed out that weather factors, e.g., temperature (°C) and
wind speed (mph) can contribute to the spread of COVID-19
[9]–[11]. Inspired by these works, we also sought to determine
whether weather could be a factor in the spread of this disease.
Moreover, it is well known that maintaining social distancing can prevent the spread of COVID-19 disease and
contain the number of casualties [12]–[17], which is based on
the assumption that the degree of social distancing is highly
related to the spread speed of COVID-19. Therefore, we also
collected social distancing related data for Wayne County and

Michigan state, to explore and test the correlation between
social distancing and the severity of COVID-19 disease.
By considering the aforementioned data features, we then
aimed to build an effective deep learning model using long
short-term memory networks (LSTM) to predict the number
of confirmed cases in Detroit. In order to provide statistical
evaluation measures to quantify the prediction effectiveness of
each type of data on the confirmed-cases prediction results,
i.e., the performance of LSTM, we trained LSTM on six
experiment groups with different features, then analyzed the
prediction results of the six feature groups.
Our observations and prediction model are intended to help
decision-makers to concentrate suitable public health efforts
and apply effective transportation management techniques to
protect residents and improve safety for Detroiters. It must
be noted that the the presented statistical analysis approaches
and the proposed prediction model were used on the Detroitbased data set as an example and due to availability. The
method could be applied, customised, adjusted, and replicated
for analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on a transportation
network and prediction of the anticipated COVID-19 cases
using a similar data set obtained from other large cities from
within the USA or from around the world.
Particularly, this paper set out to answer and is driven by
the following question:
i) What are the sudden and drastic changes in overall
temporal traffic patterns resulting from the outbreak of
COVID-19?
ii) Did traffic decrease and then recover evenly across all
measured signals during COVID-19 and as COVID-19
restrictions were being lifted?
iii) What are the impacts of COVID-19 and the social distancing on the reasons behind crashes?
iv) Can we leverage the traffic count data, crash data, and
other COVID-19 related information, such as the data on
daily confirmed cases plus social distancing and combined with weather information, to predict the number of
COVID-19 confirmed cases for the next one week?
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first review
previous works and introduce the research gap in Sec. II.
Then, we elaborate on the data sets used for the experiments
in Sec. III. Sec. IV describes experimental investigations for
the questions presented in i) to iii), and Sec. V demonstrates
the proposed algorithms to predict the number of COVID-19
confirmed cases as described in question iv). After presenting
a discussion of the prediction results in Sec. VI, we conclude
the work in Sec. VII.
II. R ELATED W ORK
In this section, we review recently published works that
focus on the COVID-19 confirmed-cases prediction or similar
research triggered by the outbreak of COVID-19 in terms of
transportation, weather, social distancing, and other aspects.
To the best of our knowledge, prior works do not consider the
effects of traffic volume data and crash-related information on
the research of COVID-19 forecasts.

A. Transportation and COVID-19
The travel restrictions put in place to reduce the spread of
COVID-19 resulted in a sharp reduction in traffic throughout
the United States. Some recent works explored the changes in
the transportation mode. For example, in the work of [2], Hu et
al. studied transportation modes during and after the COVID19 pandemic using basic laws of traffic and mathematical
analysis to explore scenarios of increased car commuting.
Lacus et al. [18] analyzed data on air traffic worldwide
with the scope of analyzing the impact of the travel ban on
the aviation sector as well as after changes in COVID-19
diagnostic criteria. Lau et al. [19] calculated the correlation
of air traffic to the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and
determined the growth curves of cases before and after lockdown. Teixeira et al. [20] presented clues on how bike-sharing
can support the transition to a post-COVID-19 society.
B. Weather and COVID-19
Moreover, the weather factors including temperature (°C),
humidity(%), wind speed (mph) are regarded as the factors
that triggered the spread of COVID-19 in recent works. For
example, through the Spearman-rank correlation test, Tosepu
et al. [9] proved that among the minimum temperature,
maximum temperature, average temperature, humidity, and
rainfall, only the average temperature is significantly related
to the COVID-19 pandemic in Jakarta Indonesia. Another
experiment [10] was conducted based on the daily new cases
and weather information in 50 states in the United States,
and clarify those weather parameters i.e., temperature and
absolute humidity will help classify the risky geographic areas
in different countries. Besides, based on the Spearman’s correlation coefficients, Mehmet et al. [11] pointed out the highest
correlations between wind speed (mph) with the outbreak of
COVID-19. In addition, a few studies have claimed that warm
weather can possibly slow down the global pandemic [11] of
COVID-19 by considering nine cities in Turkey.
C. Social Distancing and COVID-19
In addition, a portion of the related work studied the
relationship between social distancing and COVID-19. For
instance, Singh et al. [12] focused on the age-structured impact
of social distancing on the COVID-19 epidemic in India and
presented a mathematical model of the spread of infection in
a population that structured by age and social contact between
ages. Courtemanche et al. [5] pointed out that there would have
been ten times greater spread of COVID-19 without shelter-inplace orders. [13] presented that social distancing and shelter
in place has had some impact on crime and disorder, but only
for a restricted collection of crime types and not consistently
across places.
D. Other Coronavirus-Related Research
To date, more and more researchers are aggressively shifting
their focus to detect, predict, treat, and recover from COVID19. Some of the prior works do not consider transportation,
weather, or social distancing, but they presented promising

results to address the coronavirus-related issue. For example,
Qin et al. [21] proposed a novel model to predict the outbreak
of COVID-19 in populations in affected areas based on the
social media search indexes (SMSI) for dry cough, fever,
chest distress, coronavirus, and pneumonia. Lacus et al. [18]
calculated the economic impact measured in terms of loss of
GDP due to the aviation sector as well as the social impact
due to job losses related to aviation and correlated sectors
(tourism, catering, etc).

later compounded into 6 as described in future sections.
Additionally, it must be noted that in 2019, the number of
Level-II RTSMS locations was limited to 25. However, to
account for that discrepancy the normalized average volume
per intersection was used.

III. DATA D ESCRIPTION AND C RITICAL DATES
In this section, we discuss all four types of data collected
and analyzed for this study (shown in Table I): (i) traffic
volume data, (ii) daily cases number including daily confirmed
cases and daily death number, (iii) weather information, (iv)
social distancing -related data, and (v) crash data. For each
category of data, we then elaborate on the corresponding data
source and the embodied attributes, respectively.

A. Traffic Volume Data
We collected and analyzed transportation data from 73
signalized intersection sites with advanced Remote Traffic
Signal Management System (RTSMS) Level-II. Those locations have continuous data collection and analytics metrics
through camera detection. They are all owned by the City of
Detroit out of a total of 787 City-owned signals and another
approximately 700 signals owned by other jurisdictions around
the City. These signalized intersections are indispensable
parts of urban traffic networks since around two-thirds of
urban vehicle miles traveled on signal controlled roads [22].
Fig. 2 depicts the geographical distribution of the studied 73
signalized intersections, which are highlighted by the green
dots. Those locations provided aggregated daily traffic volume
data for the following 10 attributes — Bus, MotorizedVehicle,
PickupTruck, ArticulatedTruck, SingleUnitTruck, Pedestrian,
Motorcycle, Car, WorkVan, and Bicycle. Those attributes were

B. Daily Cases
We obtained and analyzed the daily cases data from Michigan’s official Coronavirus dashboard1 , including (i) the number of confirmed cases, and (ii) the number of reported deaths.
More specifically, as to the number of confirmed cases, the
number refers to the disease onset date; otherwise, either the
specimen collection date of the first positive COVID-19 test
or referral date is used. AS for the number of reported deaths,
the corresponding value represents the actual reported date
of death, and 8 confirmed deaths did not have a valid date
available and are not included in the collected data.

Timeline of shotdown and data collection period. Knowing
these specific dates are important for researchers to explore
the changes in overall traffic volume patterns across Detroit
pertaining to COVID-19 and the impact of these four types
of data on the prediction of the confirmed cases. Note that in
Detroit, the onset of COVID-19 was estimated to be ion March
1th, the shutdown started on March 19th, and people started
going back to work in the office on June 1st. however, both,
the number of closed businesses in the downtown area and the
number of people working from home in general continued to
remain high.
Thus, we defined the shutdown period as going into effect
from the 19th of March to 1st of June. We collected and
analyzed transportation data from Detroit before the first
COVID-19 confirmed cases, during the pandemic, and after the
release of shutdown — from 1/1/2019 to 6/30/2020 — covering
more than one and a half years. To keep data consistent, we
also analyzed daily cases number, weather information, and
social index data that spans the same time period.

C. Weather Data
Since previous work research that weather factors e.g., temperature (°C) and the wind speed (mph) may be a contributor to the spread of COVID-19, we also included weather
information as one of the input for COVID-19 prediction. We
collected weather data from the official website of National
1 https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98163 98173—
,00.html

Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration2 , and analyzed six
weather-related attributes including: Rain precipitation, Snow
precipitation, Average temperature, Maximum temperature,
Minimum temperature, and average wind speed.
D. Social Distancing Information
We also collected and analyzed the social distancing related attributes for Wayne County and Michigan State from
the COVID-19 Impact Analysis Platform3 published by the
University of Maryland. This data was not granular enough
to account for specifically the City’s boundaries, however, it
included valuable data for the various input contributing to
social distancing on both the County and State levels.
In particular, the social distancing index is calculated from
the six mobility indicators by the following equation: social
distancing index = 0.8 × [%staying home + 0.01 × (100 −
%staying home) × (0.1 × %reduction of all trips compared
with pre-COVID-19 benchmark + 0.2 × %reduction of work
trips + 0.4 × %reduction of non-work trips + 0.3 × %reduction of travel distance)] + 0.2 × %reduction of out-of-county
trips. The choice of weight is based on the shared travel ratio
of residents and tourists (e.g., about 20% of all trips are trips
outside the county, which leads to a choice of 0.8 for residents
and 0.2 for out-of-county travel); what trips are considered
more important (e.g., work travel is more important than nonwork travel). A higher social distance index score refers to the
fewer chances for close interpersonal interaction and reduced
opportunities for the transmission of COVID-19.

(shown in Fig. 3). Out of the 10 collected metrics related to
traffic counts at signalized intersections (shown in Table I),
we combined some of those metrics an consolidated the
classifications down to six categories. For example, the value
of ”Truck Van” represents the total number of all recorded
types of trucks and vans, while the value of ”Car” indicates
the total quantity of motorized vehicles and traditional cars.
It can be seen that the number of buses, pedestrians, and
cars both showed declining trends during the shutdown period
and then increased after the ending of the shutdown. On the
contrary, it is notable that the quantity of Bicycle and Motorcycle increased sharply even after the statewide quarantine
order. For example, the average number of Bicycle per day
increased to approximately 2× its original value and even
increase by approximately 4× during and after the quarantine,
respectively. Similarly, the average number of Motorcycle
surged to approximately 3× its before shutdown numbers.
Observations 1: Although cars are still the predominant
transportation mode, biking and motorcycling have demonstrated a transition in usage and are showing an increased
popularity (up to 4× of the previous volume) in the postCOVID-19 urban mobility for Detroit. These numbers do
not account for the seasonal weather impact on Bike and
Motorcycle usage.

IV. S TATISTICAL A NALYSIS

This observation may be attributed to the fact that cycling
can be an alternative mode of transport as it can be compatible
with social distancing regulations and allow for short individual trips. It must be notes that this excercise does not account
for the seasonal weather impact on Bike and Motorcycle
usage which coincided with the onset of COVID-19. Although
literature exploring the role of cycling in previous epidemics
is rare, it is recognized that one of the factors leading to the
rise of e-bikes in China was the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak
as people tried to avoid overcrowded public transportation
services [23], [24]. Additionally, the same pattern was also
observed in New York City [20], showing some evidence of
a modal transfer from some subway users to the bike-sharing
system.

In this section, we conduct statistical analysis on the collected metrics and we present our interesting observations
related to the changes of traffic volume and pattern, correlation
studies, and crashes statistics analysis.

Observations 2: The total number of trucks and vans
was almost the same before and during the shutdown. An
increased of approximately 40% is observed in the postshutdown numbers.

E. Crash Data
To figure out the impact of COVID-19/social distancing
metrics on the rate and severity of crashes, we also collected
19 crash metrics for Detroit from the Michigan State Police
(MSP) Traffic Crash Reporting System (TCRS)4 , which contains the information related to the number of total crashes
per day broken down by severity, other reasons, and types of
crashes. Table I lists these metrics. The monitoring frequency
for all metrics are per day.

A. Changes of Traffic Volume and Pattern
1) Changes of Traffic Volume in 2020: We first sought
to answer the question of ”What’s the sudden spatial traffic
patterns pertaining to COVID-19”. To answer this question, we
first calculate the average number of each transportation mode
among 73 signalized intersections for each monitoring day,
then We further draw the average number of each mode during
the period before, during, and after quarantine in Detroit
2 https://www.usa.gov/federal-agencies/national-weather-service
3 https://data.covid.umd.edu/
4 https://milogintp.michigan.gov/mdot-waps6/crash/

The above truck-related observation might be attributed to:
i) with the outbreak of the epidemic, a portion of Detroit
citizens are turning to online shopping methods. However,
due to the shutdown policies, some industry-related trucks and
vans stopped running, leading to a relatively stable volume
of trucks and vans during the quarantine period. ii) after the
shutdown period, although there are no specific rules to limit
the transportation of trucks and vans, it is expected that the
increased delivery demand was maintained in addition to the
increased demand from the reopening of industrial activity
and road construction.

2) Changes of Traffic Pattern between 2019 and 2020:
In order to the answer ”how did traffic patterns change

from 2019 to 2020 considering the impact of COVID-19”,
we explored the temporary distribution of each transportation
mode’s quantity among 2019 and 2020, including bus, bicycle,
car, motorcycle, and truck. More specifically, we divided
the collected traffic data set into four groups based on the
temporary periods, i.e., 2019 Jan through Feb, 2019 March
through June, 2020 Jan through Feb, and 2020 March through
June (the outbreak time period of COVID-19). For each group
of data sets, we calculated the normalized traffic volume of
each transportation mode and draw the corresponding box
plot (Fig. 4) that displays the minimum, first quartile, median,
third quartile, and maximum value of the normalized traffic
quantities. Then, we used red straight lines to connect the
medium value of each type of transportation volume, so that
the shape of the red lines on a single sub-figure of Fig. 4
provides the general traffic pattern information. In can been
seen that the red lines of sub-figures titled as ”2019 Jan - Feb”,

”2019 March - June”, and ”2020 Jan - Feb” both show the
”W ” shape, i.e., the medium value of bicycle and motorcycle
is significantly lower than the value of bus. However, when it
comes to ”2020 March - June”, this ”W ” shape is disappeared
since the medium value of bicycles is increased while the
medium value of buses is declined markedly compared with
other sub-figures.

Normalized Traffic Volume

Observations 3: Comparing the traffic volume data of 2019
and 2020, the traffic pattern of 2020 March - June (outbreak
period of COVID-19) is significantly different from the
patterns of 2019 and the first two months of 2020.

The correlation coefficient is a statistic that measures the
linear correlation between two attributes X and Y , with the
value range of [−1, +1]. A value of +1 is the total positive
linear correlation, 0 is no linear correlation, and −1 is the total
negative linear correlation. The higher correlation coefficient
represents the higher correlation between the two attributes.
Fig. 5 presents the absolute values of the calculated correlation coefficients based on Equation 1. We use the gradient
color from yellow to blue to indicate the lower to the higher
correlation between two attributes.

and daily death is highly related, with:
1− the number of transportation volume, especially for
the cars,

Note that although previous work revealed the wind speed

COVID-19 [11], in this work, we do not find the high linear
correlation between the number of daily cases with the wind
speed and other weather factors such as rain precipitation in
Detroit based on our collected dataset.

To further explore the correlation between each type of
collected metrics, such as the correlation between the number
of new confirmed cases with the daily traffic volume, we
conduct correlation coefficient analysis and joint distribution
analysis, which present a statistic analysis results on their
correlation.
1) Correlation Coefficients: One of the more frequently
reported statistical methods involves correlation analysis where
a correlation coefficient is reported representing the degree of
linear association between two variables [25], [26].
In this work, we calculated the correlation coefficients
between i) transportation modes (e.g., bus, pedestrian, bicycle,
car, motorcycle, and truck), ii) total crashes, iii) weather info
(e.g., average temperature, rain precipitation, and daily average
wind speed), iv) social distancing index of Wayne County and
Michigan, and v) daily cases (e.g., daily confirmed cases and
daily deaths). The formula for the correlation coefficient is
defined as follows.

average temperature per day. PRCP indicates the daily rain precipitation.
AWND stands for the daily average wind speed, and SC index represents
the social distancing index.

2) Joint Distribution: Based on the correlation coefficients, we can roughly know the correlation degree between
each pair of attributes, but we cannot decisively derive the
specific reason for that relationship. Therefore, we calculated

and drew the joint distributions [27] for select pairs of attributes. This demonstrates the intuitive quantitative relationship between variables (linear / non-linear, or whether there
is a more obvious correlation). Most importantly, the joint
distributions allow us to identify the relationship between
multiple attributes.
To be certain, for {X = x, Y = y}, we found all elements in
the sample space that satisfy these two values. These elements
formed a subset of the sample space, and the probability of
this subset was the joint probability of [P (X = x, Y = y)].
[p (x, y) = P (X = x, Y = y)] is called joint PMF (joint probability mass function). The joint probability can be regarded as
the probability when two events occur at the same time.TEvent
A is [X = x], and event B is [Y = y], which is [P (A B)].

from 2020 March to June. Green points display the specific
value of the selected attributes, and red straight lines are used
to represent the linear fit results between the pairs of two
attributes, e.g., the linear fit result of the daily confirmed case
and the number of buses per day. The greater the slope of the
red line, the stronger the linear relationship between the two
attributes.
Based on the joint distribution of the daily confirmed cases
and the rain precipitation shown in Fig. 6, we can deduce the
reason why they are not linearly correlated: no matter how
large the value of daily cases is, the value of PRCP is very
small, i.e., the rainfall in Detroit from March to June of 2020 is
very small, resulting in a very small range of rainfall. Under
these circumstances, the value of the correlation coefficient
between the daily cases and PRCP is low, indicating a low
linear correlation.
C. Crashes Statistics
We then analyzed crash data covering 2019 Jan to Feb, 2019
Mar to Jun, 2020 Jan to Feb, and 2020 Mar to Jun. Our goal
was to identify the percent distribution of the different crash
types, which is shown in Fig. 7.

Fig. 6. Joint distribution of various relevant attributes.

Fig. 6 presents the joint distribution between the daily
confirmed cases with other attributes such as transportation
volume, total crashes, weather, and social distancing index

Observations 5: When Comparing the 2020 crash type
percentages from before the outbreak of COVID-19 with
those during the pandemic period, a clear crash type
distribution shift is observed:
1− Angle crashes became the most common moving up
from third place (18.12%∼23.30%),
&2− Rearend crashes moved from first to second place
(27.80%∼21.38%),
3− Sideswipe crashes slightly decrease but maintained
third place (20.44%∼19.15%), and
4− Single vehicle crashes increased slightly and maintained forth place (14.51%∼16.21%).
Data key: (2020 Jan-Feb ∼ 2020 March-June)
By observing the crash type percentage distribution change,
it can be seen that rear-end crashes which used to the be the

most predominant crash type was overtaken by angle crashes.
This observation is indicative of a potentially problematic
change in driver behavior: more distraction and speeding, and
less adherence to traffic rules and controls. Additionally, rearend crashes are usually more prevalent in high-volume areas,
which is not the case during COVID-19 when the volumes are
much lower. A deeper dive into the changes in the total crash
numbers and crash rate is needed due to the unexpected crash
behavior during COVID. Those analyses were not completed
or discussed as part of this paper.
V. COVID-19 C ONFIRMED C ASES P REDICTION
In this section, we aim to conduct a further study on the influence of traffic volume data, weather information data, crash
data, and social distancing index information on the confirmedcases prediction.Our ultimate goal is building a suitable deep
learning model to predict the number of confirmed cases based
on (i) traffic volume data, (ii) daily cases number including
daily confirmed cases and daily death number, (iii) weather
information, (iv) social distancing-related data, and (v) crash
data
A. Problem Formulation and Solution
Problem Definition. We formulate the problem of predicting
the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases as a regression
n
problem. Specifically, we use T = {inputi }i=1 to represent
our training data set, in which inputi ∈ I denotes all
input features, i.e., the 58 features present in Table I
of Sec. III. Our goal is to employ the best method to
learn the function f , which minimizes the loss function
` (h (input) ; groundtruth), a measurement of the difference
between the desired output and the actual output of the current
model, such that the trained model is able to predict the
number of confirmed cases over a specific prediction horizon
with high performance. Besides, we choose 21 days as our
monitoring window, and we aim to predict confirmed-cases
for the next 7 days.
Deep Learning Model Selection. Recently, machine learning methods have been applied with success in regression
tasks. We tackle the confirmed-cases prediction problem using
Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) [28], [29] since
it has become highly successful learning models for both
classification and regression problems across diverse domains
[30]–[33]. Specifically, LSTM is a type of recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) with the capability of processing sequences
of sequential data sets. After being proposed by Hochreiter
and Schmidhuber [28], LSTM has been proved the ability
to address long-term back-propagating issues. It includes a
memory cell and a gating mechanism, which allows it to
decide what is kept in the memory cell, and how the new input
data contributes to what is already in the memory cell. Fig. 8
depicts the structure of the LSTM model that we deployed for
the confirmed-cases prediction.

Effective Measurements.
To be able to design the best prediction method, we need
some metrics to accurately measure the wellness of our
prediction approaches. To begin with, we use some commonlyused measures for our study: coefficient of determination
(R2 ), mean square error (MSE), and the root mean square
error (RMSE), which both are the commonly used evaluation
metrics for the regression problem [34]. R2 score is widely
used to indicate the fit of the machine learning model, i.e., the
higher value, the better fit result generated by the model.
The maximum value of R2 is 1 (ideal case), and it may be
a negative value with a range of (−∞, 1]. MAE measures
the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions,
without considering their direction. It’s the average over the
test sample of the absolute differences between prediction and
actual observation where all individual differences have equal
weight. RMSE is a quadratic scoring rule that also measures
the average magnitude of the error. It’s the square root of the
average of squared differences between prediction and actual
observation.
Suppose
the
input
data
(ground
truth)
is
y = {y1 , y2 , ..., yN }, and the prediction result is noted
as ŷ = {ŷ1 , ŷ2 , ..., ŷN }. MSE and RMSE are defined as:

Where TSS (total sum of squares) is the difference between
all samples and the mean value, which is N × of the variance.
Besides, RSS (residual sum of squares) is the sum of the
squares of all sample errors, which is N × times the MSE.
When the predicted value of all samples is the same as the
true value, RSS is 0, so R2 equal to 1 (ideal case).
B. Model Creation
In this subsection, we introduce the experimental hardware
and the used packages, then we give a detailed explanation
of why we conduct experiments on six experimental groups,

Experimental Groups. To show the impact of traffic volume
data, weather-related metrics, crash data, and social distancing
related data on the confirmed-cases prediction, we conduct
experiments on six experimental groups. Our first step is to
combine all five categories of 58 features present in Table I
of Sec. III to train models using LSTM methods, and we
label this group as A Group (A represent all). Then, we
exclude all traffic volume metrics but keep the left features,
and we denote it as A-T Group. Similarly, we exclude weather
information but keep other features, and we get the A-W
Group. Since we have two levels of social distancing index,
i.e., social distancing index of Wayne County (denoted as
SD), and social distancing index of Michigan state (marked
as SDM), we delete SD and SDM to get A-SD group and
A-SDM group, respectively. Finally, in order to figure out the
impact of crashes data (noted as C) on the confirmed-cases
prediction, we get A-C group. Table II shows the input features
for A Group, A-T Group, A-W Group, A-SD Group, A-SDM,
and A-C Group.

C. Training and Validation Methodology

Avoiding Overfitting of the Models. Another important factor
during the training process is epoch [43], which indicates the
number of iterations of processing the input data set during
the training process. With a higher value of epoch, the error
on training data will reduce further; however, at a crucial
tipping point, the network begins to over-fit the training data.
Hence, finding the best value of the epoch is essential to
avoid overfitting. Figure 9 shows the change in the value
of the training and validation loss functions (the smaller, the
better) as the epoch increases. Initially, the values of the two
loss functions are decreasing with higher epoch; but after 340
epochs, the value of validation loss function slowly increases
(higher than the training loss), which indicates the over-fitting
issue. Therefore, we choose 340 epochs for LSTM.

Experimental Setup. In this work, we adopt NVIDIA GPU
Workstation as our experiment platform, which is powerful
hardware with the high-quality components (4×GeForce RTX
2080 Ti graphics cards) with Intel Xeon E5-2690 v4 (CPU),
2.6 GHz of frequency, 14 cores, 64 GB memory, and installed
with Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS (operating system). NVIDIA
GPU Workstation is capable of delivering the cluster-level
performance for even the demanding applications [35],
[36]. The models learned in this paper are implemented in
Python, using TensorFlow 1.13.1 [37], Keras 2.1.5 [38], and
scikit-learn libraries [39] for model building.

that, we retain the evaluation scores and discard the current
model. The process is then repeated five times with different
combinations of sub-samples, and we use the average of the
evaluation scores as the final result for each method.
First, we need to determine the hyperparameters of our
models—an important aspect of building effective deep learning models. To be concrete, we use hold-out method [42] to
split up our training phase data set further into the parameter
training process and the validation process (80% and 20% of
the training phase data set respectively), and the validation is
an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training dataset
when tuning parameters. Then, we conduct a grid search on
these values of parameters to find the best combination that
achieves the highest performance.

Training and Validation Methodology. Next, we provide a
high-level description of our methodology before delving into
the details. We use 5-fold cross-validation [40], which is a
validation technique to assess the predictive performance of
machine learning models, judge how models perform to an
unseen data set (testing data set) [41] and avoid the over-fitting
issue during the training phase. More specifically, our data set
is randomly partitioned into five equal-sized sub-samples. At
a time, we take one sub-sample as the testing data set, and
take the remaining four sub-samples as the training data set.
Then, we fit a model on the training data set, evaluate it on
the testing data set, and calculate the evaluation scores. After

VI. R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION
In this section, we present and analyze the sensitivity of
LSTM toward different feature groups. Our discussion includes supporting evidence and reasoning to explain observed
trends, and implications of observed trends for the authorities
and decision-makers on taking specific measures for Detroit.

evaluation results.

deleting traffic volume data could result in the most significant
adverse effect on the confirmed-cases prediction, i.e., traffic
volume data is critical for the improvement of confirmed-cases
prediction.
3. Similar to the above observation, we get the conclusion
on the effectiveness comparison between traffic volume data,
social distancing related data, weather data, and crash data
in terms of prediction improvement (shown in Fig. 12)—
adding these four types of data can both improve the prediction performance, and traffic volume data is more effective
compared with social distancing related data, then followed
by weather features, and crash data seems has least impacts
on the prediction performance.

B. Evaluation Results and Observations
Next, we present the key prediction quality measures for
the six experiment groups (Figure 11). Note that among the
three evaluation metrics, i.e., R2 , MAE, and RMSE, R2 is
a more intuitive and objective performance indicator of the
fitting effect in the regression problem. Therefore, we treat
R2 as our primary evaluation metric. Finally, we make several
interesting observations as follows:

selected features), A-T (without traffic volume related features), A-W (without
weather-related features), A-SD (without social distancing related index on the
Wayne County level), A-SDM (without social distancing related index on the
Detroit level), and A-C (without crash-related features).

1. We observe that A group performs the best across all
experiment groups i.e., achieving highest (around 0.91) R2
score and lowest MAE and RMSE. This observation verifies
our hypothesis that i) traffic volume data, ii) weather features,
iii) social distancing-related data, and iv) crash information
are both useful and helpful for improving the effectiveness of
confirmed-cases prediction.
2. Considering the difference of the R2 score between A group
and other five groups, we observe that: (1) A-T group achieves
the lowest highest score, i.e., there is the biggest effectiveness
difference between A group and A-T group, which proves that

Observations 6: Besides the daily case data and social
distancing index, the data related to traffic volume, crashes,
and weather can both be a good indicator for COVID-19
confirmed-cases prediction. The traffic volume data is very
useful information regarding the prediction model.

VII. C ONCLUSION
In this work, we collected and analyzed five types of data
sets including: traffic volume, daily cases, weather information, crash features, and social distancing related data. Important observations with supporting evidence and analysis are
presented to provide practical implications for authorities and
decision-makers on taking preventive actions for Detroit. In
terms of crashes there was a clear change in crash percentage
distribution by type. During COVID-19 there was a significant
increase in angle crashes which are typically more severe
and indicative of more severe driver-behavior-related issues.
In terms of correlations, daily cases i.e., daily confirmed cases
and daily death is highly related, with: 1− the number of
transportation volume, especially for the cars, 2− total crashes,
3− social distancing index at the Wayne County level and
Michigan level, and 4− the average temperature. Additionally,
we have trained an accuracy deep learning model, which shows
the effectiveness of predicting COVID-19 confirmed-cases for
the next week, i.e., 7 days, with R2 up to approximately 0.91.
The prediction quality is tested on six experiment groups, and
the prediction results also proved that adding traffic volume
data, social distancing related metrics, weather information,
and crash feature could both improve the prediction performance.
