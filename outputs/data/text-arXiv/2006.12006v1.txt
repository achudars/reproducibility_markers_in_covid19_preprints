Abstract
In order to analyze the effectiveness of three successive nationwide lockdown enforced in India, we present
a data-driven analysis of four key parameters, reducing the transmission rate, restraining the growth rate, flattening the epidemic curve and improving the health care system. These were quantified by the consideration
of four different metrics, namely, reproduction rate, growth rate, doubling time and death to recovery ratio.
The incidence data of the COVID-19 (during the period of 2nd March 2020 to 31st May 2020) outbreak in
India was analyzed for the best fit to the epidemic curve, making use of the exponential growth, the maximum
likelihood estimation, sequential Bayesian method and estimation of time-dependent reproduction. The best fit
(based on the data considered) was for the time-dependent approach. Accordingly, this approach was used to
assess the impact on the effective reproduction rate. The period of pre-lockdown to the end of lockdown 3, saw
a 45% reduction in the rate of effective reproduction rate. During the same period the growth rate reduced from
393% during the pre-lockdown to 33% after lockdown 3, accompanied by the average doubling time increasing
form 4-6 days to 12-14 days. Finally, the death-to-recovery ratio dropped from 0.28 (pre-lockdown) to 0.08
after lockdown 3. In conclusion, all the four metrics considered to assess the effectiveness of the lockdown,
exhibited significant favourable changes, from the pre-lockdown period to the end of lockdown 3. Analysis of
the data in the post-lockdown period with these metrics will provide greater clarity with regards to the extent
of the success of the lockdown.

1 I NTRODUCTION
As of 5th June 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with its epicenter in Wuhan, China [1], has
resulted in more than 6.5 million confirmed cases and 3, 87, 155 causalities [2]. The global pandemic resulting
from COVID-19 was preceded by two other outbreaks of human coronavirus, in the 21st century itself, namely,
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(MERS-CoV) infections [3]. The possibilities of the source of the transmission of COVID-19 outbreak includes
(but is not limited to) animals, human-to-human and intermediate animal-vectors [3]. The index case for COVID19 outbreak in India was reported on 30th January 2020, in case of an individual with a travel history from
Wuhan, China [4]. The data available on [4], suggests that during the early stages, the COVID-19 positive cases
in India, were limited to individuals with a travel history involving the global hotspots of the outbreak. However,
subsequently, cases were detected in individuals who neither had a travel history involving the global hotspots,
nor had any contact with individuals who were already infected, which indicated the possibility of community
outbreak. This resulted in the Government of India announcing a lockdown across the country, driven by the
necessity of ensuring that the social distancing norms are strictly observed. While the lockdown was not the
only response to the pandemic, it was a very crucial step towards curbing the growth of COVID-19 in densely

populated countries, like India. Given the concurrent economic cost of the lockdown, it is even more critical
from the epidemiological as well as economic perspective, to assess its effectiveness. This paper presents a datadriven analysis to examine the effectiveness of the lockdown, with an emphasis on the question as to whether
the lockdown succeeded in curbing the intensity of COVID-19 spread rate in India ? In order to answer this, we
empirically analyze four different metrics, namely, reproduction number, growth rate, doubling time and death
to recovery ratio, which quantify the transmission rate, the growth rate, the curvature of epidemic curve and the
improvement of health care capacity, respectively.
We now give a brief summary of some of the available literature on quantitative approaches to the modeling of
transmission of COVID-19 outbreak. A system of ordinary differential equation (ODE) driven model for phasic
transmission of COVID-19, was analyzed for calculating the transmissibility of the virus, in [5]. Kucharski
et al. [1] considered a stochastic transmission model on the data for cases in Wuhan, China (including cases
that originated there) to estimate the likelihood of the outbreak taking place in other geographical locations. A
literature survey by Liu et al. [6], summarized that the reproductive number (and hence the infectivity) in case of
COVID-19, exceeded that of SARS. A Monte-Carlo simulation approach to assess the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic in India, was carried out in [7]. In carrying out the mathematical and statistical modeling of COVID-19,
it would be helpful to refer to the quantitative models analyzed in case of the two preceding outbreaks of human
coronavirus, namely SARS and MERS. In [8], a network model was analyzed to identify localized hotbeds, as
well as super-spreaders for SARS. Constrained by somewhat limited availability of data, a simple compartment
model was used in [9], for in-silico predictive analysis of SARS outbreak in Beijing, China. Yan and Zou [10],
determined the optimal and sub-optimal strategies for quarantine and isolation in case of SARS. A predictive
model in [11], on imported cases of MERS, was used to ascertain the likelihood of a MERS diagnosis, during the
time window between immigration and onset of the disease. The trajectory of MERS outbreak was calibrated to
a dynamic model in [12], with the goal of studying the role of time, in implementing the control measures.
A key identifier for the transmissibility of epidemiological diseases such as COVID-19 is the basic reproduction number R0 , which is defined as the average number of secondary infections resulting from an infected case,
in a population whose all members are susceptible. Accordingly, we seek to estimate the data-driven value of
R0 , for the outbreak of COVID-19 in India. Further, we also seek to determine the time-dependent reproduction
number Rt , for better clarity on the time-variability of the reproduction number, particularly in the paradigm of
its dynamics during the phases of the nationwide lockdown in India. In addition, we also estimate and analyze the
statistical performance of growth rate, doubling time and death to recovery ratio.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we detail the source of the data as well as the statistical
approaches used for the estimation of R0 and Rt . This will be followed by the discussion of the results for the
outbreak in India, in Section 3. In Section 4, we present the data driven analysis of the impact of the lockdown.
And finally, in the concluding remarks in Section 5, we highlight the main takeaways for this analysis.
2 M ETHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING REPRODUCTION RATE
The data of incidences used for the analysis reported in this paper was obtained from the website of India
COVID 19 Tracker [4], and used for the purpose of estimation of R0 . This estimation was carried out making
use of the R0 package [13] of the statistical package R. The standardized approach included in the R0 package
includes the implementation of the Exponential Growth (EG), Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation, Sequential
Bayesian (SB) method and estimation of time dependent reproduction (TD) numbers, used during the H1N1
pandemic of 2009. The package is designed for the estimation of both the “initial” reproduction number, as well
as the “time-dependent” reproduction number. Accordingly, we present a brief summary of the four approaches
used in the paper.
1. Exponential Growth (EG): As observed in [14], the reproduction number can be indirectly estimated from
the rate of the exponential growth. In order to address the disparity in the different differential equation
models, the authors observe that this disparity can be attributed to the assumptions made about the shape
of the generation interval distribution. Accordingly, the choice of the model, used for the estimation of the
reproduction number, is driven by the shape of the generation interval distribution. Based on the assumption
2

that the mean is equal to he generation intervals, the authors obtain the important result of determining an
upper bound on the possible range of values of the reproduction number for an observed rate of exponential
growth, which manifests into the worst case scenario for the reproductive number. Let the function g(a)
be representative of the generation interval distribution. If the moment generating function M (z) of g(a)
Z∞
1
subject to the
is given by M (z) = eza g(a)da, then the reproduction number is given by R =
M (−r)

exists. In particular, the Poisson distribution can be used in the analysis of the
condition that
M (−r)
integer valued incidence data [15, 16], for (discretized) generation time distribution. An important caveat is
that this approach is applicable to the time window in which the incidence data is observed to be exponential
[13].
2. Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation: The maximum likelihood model as proposed in [17] is based on the
availability of incidence data N0 , N1 , . . . , NT , with the notation Nt , t = 0, 1, 2, . . . , T denoting the count
of new cases at time t. In practice, we take the index t in days, while noting that this indexing is applicable
for other lengths of time intervals. This approach is driven by the assumption that the Poisson distribution,
models the number of secondary infections from an index case, with the average providing the estimate
for the basic reproduction number. If we denote the number of observed incidences for consecutive time
intervals by n1 , n2 , . . . , nT and let pi denote the probability of the serial interval of a case in i days (which
T
Y
e−µt µnt t
can be estimated apriori), then the likelihood function is the thinned Poisson: L (R0 , p) =
.

Note that here µt = R0

nt−i pi and p = (p1 , p2 , . . . , pk ). The absence of data from the index case

i=1

can lead to an overestimation of the initial reproduction number, and accordingly a correction needs to be
implemented [13].
3. Sequential Bayesian (SB) method: A SIR model driven sequential estimation of the initial reproduction
number was carried out by the sequential Bayesian method in [18]. It is based on the Poisson distribution driven estimate of incidence nt+1 at time t + 1 with the mean of nt eγ(R−1) . In particular, the
probability distribution for the reproduction number R, based on the observed temporal data is given
P [n1 , n1 , . . . , nt+1 |R] P [R]
, where P [R] is the prior distribution of R and
by P [R|n1 , n1 , . . . , nt+1 ] =
P [n1 , n1 , . . . , nt+1 |R]
P [n1 , n1 , . . . , nt+1 ] is independent of R.
4. Estimation of time dependent reproduction (TD): The TD method is amenable to the computation of the
reproduction numbers through the averaging over all networks of transmission, based on the observed data
[19]. Let i and j be two cases, with the respective times of onset of symptoms being ti and tj . Further, let
pij denote the probability of i being infected by j. If g(a) denotes the distribution of the generation interval,
X
g (ti − tj )
then pij = P
. Accordingly, the effective reproduction number is given by Rj =
pij , whose
w (ti − tk )

average is then given by Rt =

Rj . In absence of observed secondary cases, a correction can be made

to the time dependent estimation [20]
3 E STIMATING THE REPRODUCTION NUMBERS AND FITTING THE EPIDEMIC CURVE
In this section, we undertake the fitting of the epidemic curve and the estimation of the reproduction numbers
using the approaches enumerated in Section 2. We have obtained the daily incidence data, for the period of 2nd
3

March 2020 to 31st May 2020 [4]. The epidemic curve based on the data, for this period, is depicted in Figure 1,
which indicates that the number of COVID-19 positive cases, were growing in an almost exponential manner.

For the estimation of time-varying reproduction numbers or the effective reproduction numbers Rt , the generation time distribution is required. Accordingly, we use gamma distribution with mean of 5.2 days and the
standard deviation of 2.8 days as reported from China [21]. Now, the average Rt , using the SB and TD methods,
are 1.591 and 1.68, respectively. The R0 values using EG and ML, and the Rt values using SB and TD, along with
the corresponding 95% confidence intervals are tabulated in Table 1. Further, the seven-day rolling Rt , obtained
for the cases of SB and TD, are plotted in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively.

Figure 4: Epidemic curve using the four methods
The prediction provided by the EG, ML and TD, are reasonably close to the actual cases. However, it is clearly
observed that the most poorly fitted model is the SB model. The SB model overestimates the epidemic curve, and
thus the predictions according to this model are much higher than thev
actual incidences. Therefore, in order to

lowest RMSE. The RMSE values for all the four models are tabulated in Table 2, from where we can conclude
(based on the data set considered) that the best model for the estimation of the COVID-19 epidemic in India, is
the TD model.

4 I MPACT OF LOCKDOWN
The nationwide lockdown was imposed, on 25th March, 2020, with the goal of arresting the spread of infection, through strict restrictions on mass movement and encouraging social distancing, and it was expected that
the spread rate would come down, along with the reduction in the possibility of community transmission. This in
turn would result in curbing the number of cases from rising dramatically, thereby enabling the healthcare system
with more time to make necessary arrangements for the better preparedness of the medical infrastructure. Thus,
6

the first phase of lockdown until 14th April, 2020, was extended to another two phases of lockdown, with slightly
relaxed restrictions, and were enforced from 15th April to 3rd May, 2020 and from 4th May to 31st May, 2020.
This section discusses the impact of the entire lockdown on COVID-19 spread, by analyzing various metrics,
namely, the effective reproduction rate, the growth rate, the doubling time and the death to recovery ratio.
4.1 I MPACT ON EFFECTIVE REPRODUCTION RATE
One of the key mathematical indicator relied upon, in the paradigm of the spread of COVID-19 pandemic and
consequent policy decisions is the effective reproduction rate (ERR) or the time-varying reproduction number.
As ERR provides the information of time varying transmission rate, it would be a natural choice to measure the
impact of the entire lockdown, as well as different phases of the lockdown. In the preceding Section 3, we have
shown that, amongst all the models, the TD is the best fitted model, for the Indian epidemic curve. Hence, we
discuss the impact of lock-down in the context of the TD-based Rt .

Figure 5: Impact of lockdown on ERR
Figure 5a depicts the seven-day rolling ERR. It is clearly observed that, before the lockdown, the Rt was
unsteady, but it started dipping downward after the commencement of the lockdown. In the pre-lockdown period,
the average seven-day ERR was 2.23. Therefore, before the lockdown, if 100 individuals had COVID-19, they
would have infected 223 people on an average. In the first lock-down period, the average ERR came down to
1.73, a 22% drop. Thus, at this rate, 100 carriers would infect 173 others on an average. In the second and third
lockdown periods, the ERR furthers dipped to 1.31 and 1.22, respectively. Therefore, from the pre-lockdown to
the end of lockdown 3, the overall rate of reduction of ERR was nearly 45%. Figure 5b displays the phase-wise
1
average Rt . The descriptive statistics of Rt and the corresponding confidence intervals are described in Table
3. From these results, we can clearly infer that, so far, the lockdown has by and large succeeded, in reducing the
ERR. However, this observation come with the caveat that the three successive lockdowns did not drive the Rt
below 1, which is suggestive that the epidemic may exhibit a surge once all the restrictions are lifted.

4.2 I MPACT ON GROWTH RATE
The reduction of ERR should further reduce the growth rate of daily incidences. In order to see the growth
rate, in a particular time period, we calculate the seven-day rolling growth rate in that period, and then take the
average. Suppose that we have daily incidence numbers, D(t), t = 1, 2, 3, . . . , 20, for a period of 20 days. We
D(i + 7) − D(i)
, where i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , 13, and we get a dataset
first compute the seven-day rolling growth rates,
D(i)
of 13 points. Finally, the simple mean of the dataset is calculated. If the seven-day average growth is 30% in a
month, then the average weekly number of positive cases would have increased from 100 to 130 in that month.

Figure 6: Weekly growth rate of positive cases
Figure 6 illustrates the average weekly growth rate in different time periods. In the pre-lockdown period (L0),
the growth rate was 393%. It means that the weekly number of positive cases, increased drastically from 100 to
493 in the pre-lockdown period. The growth rate has decreased to 191% in lockdown 1 (L1). It further reduced
to 47% and 32% in lockdown 2 (L2) and lockdown 3 (L3), respectively. Therefore, we can conclude, that the
implementation of nationwide lockdown has resulted in slowing down the growth rate of COVID-19 positive
cases.
4.3 I MPACT ON DOUBLING TIME
One of the key indicator to see the spread of any pandemic is the doubling time. It is referred to as the time
(usually counted in number of days) it takes for the total number of cases to double. The doubling time of n days
means that if there were 100 cases at day 0, then, on day n, the number of cases would be 200. The more the
doubling time is, the more the possibility of achieving a flattened epidemic curve.

Figure 7a displays the doubling rate for five-day moving averages. The escalation in doubling time is easily
seen from the figure. The doubling time during third lockdown period was about 12-14 days, up from 4-6 days
prior to the commencement of the lockdown. The phase-wise average doubling timings are shown in Figure 7b.
The increment in doubling time is clearly visible from this figure. Therefore, from these results, we infer that the
doubling time has improved significantly after the enforcement of nationwide lockdown.
4.4 I MPACT ON DEATH TO RECOVERY RATIO
In a pandemic, the performance of any nation’s health care system, is measured ultimately in terms of deaths
and recoveries. This segment discuses the effect of lockdown on death to recovery ratio (DTR). The DTR is
defined as a ratio between total number of deaths and total number of recoveries:
DT Rt =

Total number of deaths upto time t
.
Total number of recoveries upto time t

The DTR stipulates the clinical management ability or the efficiency of health system. It is highly important to
keep the value of the DTR as low as possible. Mathematically, the closer this value is to zero, the better the
efficiency of healthcare system, in dealing with the pandemic. For example, DT Rt = 0.5 implies that, for every
100 recoveries, 50 infected patients would have died. The seven-day rolling DTR is plotted in Figure 8a. It is
clearly seen that the DTR has declined significantly as time has progressed. The phase-wise bar chart also depicts
the reduction of DTR over the period of three months. In pre-lockdown (L0) and lockdown 1 (L1) periods together,
the average DTR was 0.28. It reduced to 0.14 in lockdown 2 (L2) and further declined to 0.08 in lockdown 3 (L3),
which shows that, in this short period, the Indian health care system has been improved significantly to tackle the
COVID-19 pandemic.

5 C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we have discussed the impact of lockdown on COVID-19 infection rate, in India. The aim was
to see whether the lockdown has really curbed intensity of spread. In order to do that, we empirically analyzed
different metrics that mainly measure the spread of infectious disease, like COVID-19. The metrics are effective
reproduction rate, growth rate, doubling time and death to recovery ratio (DTR). For case of ERR, it is seen
that the lockdown has reduced the reproduction rate by more than 40%. The growth rate has also substantially
decreased from the initial period to the end of lockdown. On the other hand, the doubling time has largely
improved over the three month period. The rate of increment from pre-lockdown to lockdown 3 is nearly 183%.
Finally, we described the impact on DTR, which quantifies the number of death against the number of recoveries.
We observed significant downfall of DTR from the month of April. On average, the initial DTR of 0.28 has dipped
downward to 0.08 at the third phase of lockdown. Therefore, despite rising cases of COVID-19 infection in India,
the lockdown has managed to curb the spread to some extent. However, the caveat is that, despite the encouraging
results, the pandemic will persist, unless the ERR is driven below 1. It remains to be seen if there is a adverse
movement of the metrics, after the relaxation of the restrictions. The behaviour of these metrics in post-lockdown
period will provide a more accurate and complete information regarding the success or failure of lockdown.
