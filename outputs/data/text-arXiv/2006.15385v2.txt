Abstract
Abstract. After the outbreak of the disease caused by the new virus COVID-19, the mitigation stage
has been reached in most of the countries in the world. During this stage, a more accurate data analysis
of the daily reported cases and other parameters became possible for the European countries and has been
performed in this work. Based on a proposed parametrization model appropriate for implementation to an
epidemic in a large population, we focused on the disease spread and we studied the obtained curves, as well
as, we investigated probable correlations between the country’s characteristics and the parameters of the
parametrization. We have also developed a methodology for coupling our model to the SIR-based models
determining the basic and the effective reproductive number referring to the parameter space. The obtained
results and conclusions could be useful in the case of a recurrence of this repulsive disease in the future.

Introduction

The disease of the new virus COVID-19 which has been pandemic in the world for about 90 days, the “wavefront”
of infection has reached its mitigation stage. Therefore, this is the time to turning our thoughts not only to
its subsequent, painful and serious implications of this pandemic [1], [2], [3], [4] but also, it could be useful to
analyse the way of growth of the disease among the countries until the 10th of May 2020, as well as, to correlate
these with the main parameters that likely played a significant role.
In particular, we consider extremely useful to study the specific characteristics of each country that played
a role, the financial level or even genetic behaviour against to the new corona virus and the associated disease.
Some of these characteristics used as mathematical parameters for performing correlation studies. The results
of this study could give us information for preparing more effective defensive strategies or practical “tools” in
a possible future return of the pandemic which constitutes the central goal of the present work. The outline of
the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we present a theoretical methodology for parametrizing an epidemic, in
Section 3 we explain how to couple the present parametrization model with the basic SIR model, in Section 4
we give results relevant to the end-to-end epidemics growth and in Section 5 we discuss the conclusions.

2.1

Theoretical methodology
Epidemic model

Our methodology is based on the parametrization of the growth of the COVId-19 disease that we used in
our recent work [5] and also in [6] and [7], that we call “semi-gaussian of n-degree”. It was used for fitting the
disease’s growth at various indicative countries and it belongs to the model category of “Regression Techniques”
for epidemic surveillance. The basic-single term expression of this parametrization model is
c(t) = Atn e−t/τ

(1)

where the function c(t) applied in an epidemic spread represents the rate of the infected individuals as the new
daily reported cases (DRC) and coincides with the function I(t) in the SIR model, as we can see in the following.
Also A is constant while n and τ are model parameters. The more analytical approach, in the general case
1

from the mathematical point of view, comes from the fundamental study of the epidemic growth and includes a
number of terms in a form of double summation related to the inverse Laplace Transform of a rational function
given in [8], referring to the “Earlier stages of an epidemic in a large population”. In this hypothesis, the number
of unaffected individuals may be considered to be constant, while any alternation is assumed small compared
to the total number of exposed individuals. This function, which could be called “Large Population Epidemic
Semi-Gaussian model” (LPE-SG), is the following
c(t) =

N X
M
X

Aij tnij e−t/τij

(2)

i=1 j=1

where Aij are arbitrary amplitudes, nij are the degrees of the model (assumed fractional in a general case) and
τij are the time constants representing in our case a mean infection time respectively. Also, M and N are the
finite number of terms to be included. It is easy to prove that the “peaking time” of the function of each term
depends on the product of nij by τij , that is, tpij = nij τij .
In practice, the number of the required terms should be determined according to the shape of the data and
the desired achievable accuracy. After investigation of the fitting performance we concluded that, at most, two
terms of the above double sum are adequate for our purpose. Also, the cross terms, with indices ij and ji,
cannot help more the flexibility of the model. In particular, a) the degree of the model can “cover” any early or
late smaller outbreak of the daily cases, while b) the mean infection time is a characteristic inherent parameter
of the disease under study and thus should be essentially constant. For these reasons, the expression with one
term was adequate in most of the cases, whereas, the 6 free parameters allow a very good flexibility for the
fitting. Therefore, we can write
c(t) =

2 X
2
X

Aij tnij e−t/τij = A1 tn1 e−t/τ1 + A2 tn2 e−t/τ2

(3)

i=1 j=1

For the fitting procedure, we have used two alternative tactics, based on either the daily model or on the
cumulative integral of it. The decision depends on the goodness of the fit in each case based on the criterion of
minimizing the χ2 /dof, as we have done in our previous work. [5]. The starting date (at t = 0) was one day
before the first reported case (or cases). The cumulative parametrization model and the fitting model take the
following forms respectively
C(t) = A1 τ1 1+n1 [Γ(n1 + 1) − Γc (n1 + 1, t/τ1 )] + A2 τ2 1+n2 [Γ(n2 + 1) − Γc (n2 + 1, t/τ2 )]

(4)

2
C(t) = p1 p1+p
[Γ(p2 + 1) − Γc (p2 + 1, t/p3 )] + p4 p61+p5 [Γ(p5 + 1) − Γc (p5 + 1, t/p6 )]

(5)

where the symbol Γ represents the gamma function and the Γc the upper incomplete gamma function at time t.

2.2

Implementation strategy

The above generalized mathematical model, has the advantage of providing more flexibility when the raw data
include a composite structure or superposition of more than one growth curves which could be coexisting. This
is possible to happen due to restriction measures applied during the evolution of an epidemic. Regardless of
the number of terms used, the obtained parameters must be well understood, in the sense of their role in the
problem. Let us consider a country where the disease starts to outbreak due to a small number of infected
individuals. In this stage we assume that the country has been isolated in a relatively high degree, but of
course not ideally. At this point, the disease starts with a transmission rate which depends on the dynamics of
the spread in each city and village, while other inherent properties of the disease affect its dynamics (e.g. the
immune reaction, the incubation time and recovering time).
At this point, we must clarify also the issue of the “size” of the epidemic. The SIR-based models assume that
the size, N, that is the total number of individuals exposable to the disease is unchanged during its evolution,
a fact which cannot be exactly true. On the other hand, a fraction of the size concerns individuals who are
in quarantine for different reasons (due to tracing or for precautionary reasons). Therefore, the size cannot be
absolutely constant and the forecasting at the first stage (during the growing of the epidemic) should be very
uncertain. In the second stage (around the turning point), the situation is more clear by means of more accurate
parametrization, although high fluctuations could still be present. At the third stage (mitigation or suppress),
an overall parametrization can be made and any trial for forecasting concerns a likely future comeback of the
epidemic. In any of the three stages regardless of the level of uncertainties the parametrization specifies the
associated parameters according to the epidemic model used. It is known that the “basic reproductive number”
symbolized by R0 is a very important parameter of the spreading of the epidemic. In the SIR-based models it
2

is determined at the first moments of the epidemic (mathematically at t = 0) and is related to the associated
parameters. Moreover, as it is proven in the next, this parameter doesn’t depend on the size N of the epidemic.
By using the present parametrization model we assume that the size of the epidemic is, not only unknown,
but also much smaller than the population of the country or city under study, that is, it constitutes an unbiased
sample of the potentially exposable generic population. Once the epidemic is pretty much eliminated, the size
could be also estimated “a posteriori” by the help of a SIR-based model. However, in this case, the parameters
of the spread, as well as, the reproductive number are already determined by the methodology given in the next.
We consider that this more generic approach facilitates the fitting process and improves the accuracy because
of the existence of an analytical mathematically optimal solution.

Coupling with the SIR-based models
Short description of SIR model

The classical model for studying the spread of an epidemic, SIR, belongs to the Mathematical or State-Space
category of models along with a large number of other types which are analytically described in [9]. Our model
belongs to the continuum deterministic SIR models in the special case applied at the earlier stage of an epidemic,
assuming that the population is much greater than the infected number of people [8]. This model can be applied
also when the epidemic is in each latest stage where the total number of infected individuals is an unbiased
sample of the population. Under these assumptions, this model can be related to the classical SIR model, or
even with its extensions (SEIR and SIRD), by means of correlating their parameters. Below, we give a brief
description of the basic SIR epidemic model.
Let us describe briefly the three state equations of the SIR model:
a
dS
= − SI
dt
N

(6)

dI
a
= SI − βI
dt
N

(7)

dR
= βI
(8)
dt
The function S = S(t) represents the number of susceptible individuals, I = I(t) the number of infected
individuals and R = R(t) the number of recovered individuals, all referred per unit time, usually measured in
[days]. The constant factor a is the transmission rate, the constant factor β is the recovering rate and N is
the size of the system (the total number of individuals assumed constant in time), that is, S + I + R = N , at
every time. The assumptions concerning the initial and final conditions are, S(0) 6= 0, S(∞) > 0, I(∞) = 0 and
R(0) = 0, R(∞) = N − S(∞).
This model does not have an analytical mathematical solution additional the two parameters a and β are
constant during the spread of the epidemic. A solution is derived only with the approximation, βR/N < 1,
that is, when the epidemic essentially concerns a small number of recovered compared to the total number of
individuals. In this case a Taylor’s expansion to an exponential function is used. In our study, we work for the
general case without this assumption.

3.2

Synergy in the parametric space

In our basic model, C(t), the integral of the function c(t), must be compared to the total number of infected
individuals I, while the parameter A undertakes the scaling of the particular data. The parameter τ does
not necessarily coincides with the inverse of the “ mean infection rate”, a, but 1/τ expresses an “effective
transmission rate” in our model. The parameter n cannot be equalized to any of the parameters of the SIR
model. However, this parameter contributes to the key parameter of the epidemic spread, the so-called “basic
reproductive number”, R0 , which is defined at t = 0 and is equal to R0 = (a/β)(S(0)/N ), where β is the “mean
recovering rate”. Because S(0) ≈ N , it becomes R0 ≈ a/β. However, the S(0)/N ) represents a basic threshold,
the so called “population density”, above which the epidemic is initiated and growing when Ro = (a/β) > 1.
Moreover the “effective reproductive number”, Re , a variable as a function of time is also defined by the
same way as follows
Re = −

Because the condition for creating an epidemic is Re > 1, the corresponding condition should be S/N > 1/R0 .
Also, at t = 0 should be Re (0) ≡ R0 , at the peaking time t = tp should be Re (tp ) = 1 and at t = ∞ takes the
3

S
value Rt = R0 N
(∞) < R0 . By using the expressions of Eq. 9, including only the value of I and its derivative,
one can estimate roughly the Re at any time t. It can be also shown, that the S(∞)/N can be determined by
solving the following transcendental equation numerically.
 S(∞) 

S(∞)
S(0) − R0 [N −S(∞)]

Therefore, we can conclude that for Re , at the outbreak of the epidemic (rising branch of the curve) we have,
1 < Re < R0 , exactly at the peak of the curve, Re = 1 (because S = N/R0 , as we explain in the next) and at
the mitigation stage (leading branch of the curve), Re < 1 and tends to a minimum value at the asymptotic
tail of the curve which is

Re ≈ R0 e−R0

R(∞)

<< 1

(11)

Once the above relationship is achieved, the R0 can be determined by solving the derived algebraic equation.
Indeed, this was our initial motivation to perform the following analysis. The methodology for accomplishing
it, was based on the idea to exploit the property of our model at its maximum at the peaking time, which is
tp = nτ , as it can be easily proven by differentiation. On the other hand, in the SIR model a peak is expected
some time for the function I, as the typical effect of the epidemic’s spread. Considering that both models can be
fitted to the data, in the vicinity of the peak must agree, and therefore, we must claim that Ip = C(tp ). Let us
first find an expression of the S, R and I at the peaking time, symbolizing them by, Sp , Rp and Ip respectively.
In order to relate S with R, we replace I from Eq. 6 into Eq. 8, we obtain
ln S − ln S(0) = −

[R − R(0)]

(12)

from which, taking into account that S(0) ≈ N , we derive the solution

The later result at the peaking time gives us an expression of Rp

Adding the three functions at the peaking time, Sp , Ip and Rp , we derive the algebraic equation
Ip
+ ln R0 − R0 + 1 = 0
(18)
N
In order to achieve an equation independent of size N , we must express Ip /N as a function of the model
parameters, that is, by using the maximum value of the model curve [5] and the Eq. 8 of the SIR model by
integration with upper limit the infinity, as follows

where the symbol Γ represents the gamma function, n0 and τ0 are the particular values obtained by a fitting)
and τ0 0 = 1/β. Replacing the above expression to Eq. 18 and setting sN = S(∞)/N we obtain

(20)

This transcendental equation can be solved only numerically for R0 in which the combined unknown sN is
also found numerically by using again another transcendental Eq. 10, by using multiple iterations leading to
a converging accurate solution within 12 loops. The parameter n of the model is essentially the expresser of
R0 , while the obtained value of R0 concerns an hypothetical SIR model fitted to the data of the daily reported
cases (DRC). From the obtained solution for R0 we can also calculate the parameter a of SIR model, a = βR0 ,
where β can be calculated from the peak value of the daily reported recovered individuals by the formula,
β = Rp /Itot,p , where Itot,p represents the integral of the DRC curve with upper limit the peaking time tp . In
particular,

Implementing the above methodology, by using home made software codes written in Matlab platform [10],
we obtained the fitting of the DRC curve for Greece at the mitigation stage, shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. The
fitted parameters, n0 = 4.57 and τ0 = 5.96 and the solutions R0 = 2.90 and sN = 0.06. For the parameter β we
used a typical-average value found in the literature where, β = 0.10 and the same value we used for the other
analyzed countries. Two characteristic parametrizations of very large normalized size and very small one (64
times smaller), that is, of Belgium and Malta, respectively, are given in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. Definitely, without
seeing the vertical scale, one cannot distinguish which corresponds a large or a small normalized size. The only
visible difference at a glance, is the peaking time (29 and 16 days respectively).

Study of the end-to-end epidemic growth

4.1

Correlation searches

For the data analysis we selected the 29 countries of EU, including Switzerland and UK obtained from [11].
The characteristics of the countries relevant to our study are summarized in Table 1. In particular, we used the
population density, the estimated normalized total number of infected individuals (determined by the number
of deaths by using a typical constant factor) and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), nominal per capita.
The degree of correlation among the above characteristics and the modelling parameters, was studied by the
“theoretical pearson linear correlation coefficient” given by the following formula
ρ(X, Y ) =

Cov(X, Y )
σx σy

(22)

where X and Y are considered normal random variables, σx and σy are the corresponding standard deviations
and Cov(X, Y ) is their covariance. However, as it is done in practice, we calculated the “sampling pearson
coefficient” (SPC), r(X, Y ), for n observed random pairs (Xi , Yi , ..., Xn , Yn ), where the X can represent the
first selected variable and Y the second one.
The correlation study concerned eight pairs, as is illustrated in Table 2. The conclusions of the linear
correlation study are the following:
1. For the population density D: no correlation was found with other parameters.
2. For the model parameters n0 and τ0 : strong anti-correlation was found.
3. For the peaking time tp : very strong anti-correlation was found with the basic reproductive number, R0 .

Table 2: Summary of the correlation results.
The scatter plot of the basic reproductive number R0 and the peaking time tp is shown in Fig. 5. This
correlation gives us the following message: the higher R0 results to less a delay of the upcoming peak in the
DRC curve. The obtained slope of the linear fit was −8.4 ± 0.2 days. On the other hand, the R0 among the
analyzed countries, present statistical fluctuations from about 2 to 4.6, obeying roughly a gaussian distribution
with mean value 2.96 and standard deviation 0.68 (or relative to mean 23 %). The parameters n and τ also
fluctuate, as we can see in Fig. 6 while the peaking time tp shows stochastic characteristics obeying similarly a
gaussian distribution with mean 25.7 days and standard deviation 7.8 days (or relative to mean 30 %).
Since R0 fluctuates (and in turn the tp due to their linear correlation) among the different countries randomly
without presenting any correlation with their associated parameters, we can conclude that the normalized size of
the epidemic can be explained only by taking into account other reasons and aspects related to the way citizens
interact and behave as well as the degree of social distances and mobility or transport within a country’s
major cities. Also, a crucial role played definitely the degree of quarantine and likely some individual biological
differentiations (genetic and other related characteristics).

Quantitative surveillance of the epidemic

The capability for surveying the epidemic spread during the three main stages is very important and could be
based on the daily data and the mathematical modelling we presented. In the mitigation stage the surveying is
even more useful and crucial when the restriction measures are starting to be relaxed. The crucial condition for
a new epidemic reappearance is based on the effective reproductive number, Re , as well as, on the corresponding
population threshold. However, because of the large statistical fluctuations caused by the poor statistics of data
as well as because of the low slope of the epidemic curve in this stage, it is very hard to achieve accurate
numbers, but only a qualitative estimate as follows. The Re can be estimated from the expressions in Eq. 9 and
using average numerical approximations of the slope, dI/dt. An alternative and practical formula based on the
parametrization model SG-LPE can be easily proven and is, Re = 1 + (nτ /t − 1)/β. This formula is valid only
in the vicinity of the peak, namely in the narrow range from 0.5tp to 1.5tp , because the fitted model and the
SIR one differ in the slopes at both side tails. Once Re is estimated, the population density threshold, in turn,
can be calculated and should be S(t)/N = 1/Re , assuming that the normalized size N can also be estimated
by a similar level of accuracy. Therefore the crucial condition in the mitigation stage is written as

The derivative has to be calculated as an average slope, ∆I/∆t, preferably at least within one week. Assuming that this slope is Iw0 and the corresponding average cases in a week is Iav the crucial condition becomes

where we used the typical values, β = 0.1 days−1 and S(∞)
≈ 15 for having a practical result as a case study. This
simplified formula combined with one-week measurements should be very useful because the relative fluctuations
of the DRC are expected to be very large.

Conclusions
A systematic analysis of the epidemic characteristics of the new virus COVID-19 disease spread is presented
in this work. For the mathematical analysis, we used a model that we called LPE-SG which facilitates the
parametrization by an analytical mathematical description. We also presented a methodology of its coupling
with the SIR-based models aiming to determine the basic and effective reproductive numbers based on the
fitted parameters. Analysing the daily reported cases of European countries, we found no correlation between
the population density, normalized size or GDP of the countries with respect to the spreading characteristics.
Another important finding of our study was a strong anti-correlation, statistically significant, of the basic
reproductive number and the peaking time. Moreover, we found that the basic reproductive number in the
epidemics studied showed a uniform distribution with a wide range of values. This means that it is mainly
influenced by many factors and generic characteristics of the society in a country.
