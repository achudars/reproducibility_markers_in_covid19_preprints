Abstract
This study develops a new method to quantify neighborhood activity levels at high spatial and temporal resolutions and test whether, and to what
extent, behavioral responses to social distancing policies vary with socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. We define exposure density (Ex ρ)
as a measure of both the localized volume of activity in a defined area and
the proportion of activity occurring in non-residential and outdoor land uses,
areas that are associated with an increased risk of exposure to the virus. We
utilize this approach to capture inflows/outflows of people as a result of the
pandemic and changes in mobility behavior for those that remain. First,
we develop a generalizable method for assessing neighborhood activity levels by land use type using smartphone geolocation data over a three-month
period covering more than 12 million unique users within the Greater New
York area. Second, we measure and analyze disparities in community social
distancing by identifying patterns in neighborhood activity levels and characteristics before and after the stay-at-home order. Finally, we evaluate the

effect of social distancing in neighborhoods on COVID-19 infection rates and
outcomes associated with localized demographic, socioeconomic, and infrastructure characteristics in order to identify disparities in health outcomes
related to exposure risk. Our findings provide insight into the timely evaluation of the effectiveness of social distancing for individual neighborhoods
and support a more equitable allocation of resources to support vulnerable
and at-risk communities. Our findings demonstrate distinct patterns of activity pre- and post-COVID across neighborhoods. The variation in exposure
density has a direct and measurable impact on the risk of infection.

1. Introduction
When Wuhan, China was struck by an outbreak of a novel coronavirus
(2019-nCoV or COVID-19) in late 2019, scientists were concerned about the
potential for rapid spread of the virus [1]. By the end of June 2020, a total
of 10 million people had been infected and 500,000 people had lost their lives
in more than 200 countries [2, 3]. The COVID-19 pandemic is considered
the most severe public health crisis since the 1918 Spanish flu due to the
transmission and infection characteristics of the disease, with few effective
treatments at the time this article was written [2, 4, 5, 6]. Given the global
scale of the pandemic, a coordinated response is necessary to mitigate the
spread of the virus both within and across country borders [7].
Social distancing (also referred to as physical distancing) is one of the
most effective behavioral strategies to reduce the transmission rate of COVID19 [4, 5, 8, 9, 6, 10]. Social distancing reduces the probability of contacts
between individuals who might be infected, resulting in reduced exposure
risk [10, 11]. Governments have implemented a range of social distancing
policies, including travel bans, restrictions on gatherings, school closures,
non-essential business closures, and restaurant restrictions. In particularly
hard-hit locations, mandatory stay-at-home orders have been issued to limit
or avoid unnecessary close contacts outside of the home [11, 10, 12].
Studies have found social distancing measures help to prevent transmission of the virus and reduce the reproduction (R0 ) number [6, 8, 10, 13, 14,
15, 16]. These practices help to avoid overwhelming hospital intensive care
units (ICUs) and health care systems, control doubling time of infections, and

ultimately save lives [6, 17, 11]. Although not without potentially significant
hardship to individuals and communities, social distancing is an important
public health tool to flatten the epidemic curve and support longer-term
economic and public health benefits [4, 17, 18].
However, the impact of, and response to, stay-at-home orders, and social distancing guidelines more broadly, is not uniform across neighborhoods
and communities. In order to maximize the positive effects of social distancing, individuals need to change their typical behavior, often dramatically
[3, 4]. Despite government-mandated social distancing policies (e.g. New
York State’s PAUSE order), socio-behavioral responses vary across neighborhoods, further contributing to disparities in risk of infection [5, 10]. Disparities in social distancing practices, namely geographic or population subgroup differences in adopting behavior changes in response to the same policy
context, may stem from varying levels of awareness, perception, or belief in
the severity of the virus threat; differences in social and cultural norms; or
the ability of households and communities to alter normal activity patterns
given economic constraints or other existing responsibilities [3, 10, 19, 20].
For example, lower-income households typically do not have the option to
work from home and going to a place of work (often in essential services) is
unavoidable, meaning higher risk of exposure to COVID-19 for themselves
as well as their families and communities [10, 21]. Within specific neighborhoods and communities, norms can also be reinforcing; if large numbers of
residents are essential workers and not socially distancing, other residents
may have similar behavioral responses [3].
A growing number of outbreaks are occurring in densely populated areas
[22], with disproportionate impacts on low-income and minority communities. Measuring and understanding social distancing and behavior change
across neighborhoods during a pandemic can provide critical insight to the
design and implementation of more effective - and equitable - public health
policy. Given the potential heterogeneity in localized responses to social distancing recommendations, quantifying local patterns of activity represents
an emerging tool to understand and eventually reduce local exposure risk
and limit community outbreaks [10]. Although there has been increasing
awareness of the troubling disparities in infection rates and outcomes in vulnerable communities, the effectiveness of behavioral interventions at the scale
of individual neighborhoods has not been fully studied. Often, studies that
do attempt to observe effects at higher spatial resolutions rely on simulations
or are limited to relatively coarse areal units (e.g. county or state) due to
3

data limitations and computational constraints.
This study develops a new method to quantify neighborhood activity levels at high spatial and temporal resolutions. We define exposure density
(Ex ρ) as a measure of both the localized volume of activity in a defined area
and the proportion of activity occurring in non-residential and outdoor land
uses, areas that are associated with an increased risk of exposure to the virus.
We utilize this approach to capture inflows/outflows of people as a result of
the pandemic and changes in mobility behavior for those that remain. We
test whether, and to what extent, behavioral responses to social distancing
policies vary with socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. We focus on New York City (NYC), the first epicenter of the pandemic in the
U.S., which enacted a statewide “stay-at-home” order (NY on PAUSE) on
March 22. Through June 30, NYC had more than 212,000 confirmed cases
of COVID-19, accounting for 8% of the nationwide total, resulting in at least
18,492 confirmed deaths and 4,604 probable deaths. Our methodology proceeds in three steps. First, we develop a generalizable method for assessing
neighborhood activity levels using smartphone geolocation data over a threemonth period covering more than 12 million unique users within the Greater
New York area, together with land use information at 1 m grid resolution.
Second, we measure and analyze disparities in community social distancing
by estimating variations neighborhood activity and associated patterns in
community characteristics before and after the stay-at-home order. Finally,
we evaluate the effect of social distancing in neighborhoods on COVID-19
infection rates and outcomes associated with localized demographic, socioeconomic, and infrastructure characteristics in order to identify disparities in
health outcomes related to exposure risk. Our findings provide insight into
the timely evaluation of the effectiveness of social distancing for individual
neighborhoods and support a more equitable allocation of resources to support vulnerable and at-risk communities.
2. Background
Emerging research has begun to leverage a variety of new data resources
to measure and evaluate social distancing practices. For example, the World
Bank COVID-19 Mobility Task Force and Emergency Operation Center (EOC)
uses anonymized Cell Detail Record (CDR) data from Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) to provide technical, operational, and decision-making support
to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, particularly for data-poor countries [23].
4

Data fields include the date, number of devices, number of trips, and mean
distance traveled for a given region. Specifically, the dataset contains origin–
destination information aggregated to cell tower capture areas, providing
insights into movement patterns and human activity density on a given day.
Social media, such as Twitter or Facebook, has been another popular
source to measure social distancing [24]. Kayes et al. [25] use Twitter data
to develop an automated social distancing measurement method and sentiment detection model in Australia. The study finds that more than 80% of
Twitter users have a positive sentiment and they are willing to accept social
distancing practices to protect their communities [25]. Also, Xu et al. [26]
develop a social mobility index as a measure of social distancing and travel
patterns by using public geotagged Twitter data. This research defines the
social mobility index based on total travel distance between identified home
locations and other visited locations for each user, and compares this metric
before and after the pandemic declaration. The authors observe a decrease
in mobility of 62% in the U.S on average, ranging from 39% to 77% across
different states.
Using a range of urban sensing modalities, Das and James [27] at the
Newcastle University Urban Observatory in the United Kingdom developed
a dashboard to provide social distancing status and vehicle mobility patterns in real time. This group used thousands of sensors from vehicular and
pedestrian environments, such as parking lot occupancy sensors and public
transportation GPS trackers, to monitor urban dynamics. They analyzed
more than 1.8 billion data points to compare daily mobility patterns after
the lockdown against the same day from the previous year. The research
observed peaks of pedestrian movement disappeared and mobility volume
decreased by more than 90% after the stay-at-home order. Other sensing approaches include the use of computer vision and synoptic imagery to quantify
pedestrian and motorized activity.
Many researchers have turned to Point-of-Interest (POI) data, which is
location information primarily used by retailers for customer tracking (e.g.
visitor counts) and commercial space planning, extracted from mobile phone.
As POI data typically provides the location of stores or restaurants and the
number of visitors, activity levels at POI locations can be used to measure
social distancing at specific places. Many studies rely on POI data provided by SafeGraph, in partnership with ESRI. For example, Bayham et al.
[28] analyzed POI data to quantify mobility patterns in Colorado during the
early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic at the state and county level. The
5

report found that residents reduced their social activities by 80% after the
statewide stay-at-home order, and residents of higher-income counties reduced their activity levels more than lower-income counties. Other recent
studies, including Allcott et al. [29] and Painter and Qiu [30], use POI data
to understand potential disparities in social distancing practices based on
political affiliation.
Finally, cell phone GPS data, primarily collected from smartphone applications, has gained widespread attention for its potential to understand
large-scale population dynamics [31]. Google, for instance, uses anonymized
and aggregated mobility data of users based on their Google Location History
to measure mobility patterns and demonstrate the effectiveness of various social distancing policies [32, 33, 34]. Based on these data, research has quantified changes in the amount of time individuals spend away from their place
of residence and changes in the number of visits to non-residential places,
such as retail stores, parks, and transit stops, aggregated to the county level.
Similarly, Apple extracts user requests for directions in Apple Maps to create
anonymized, daily mobility data for metropolitan areas [35]. In addition to
Google and Apple, there are third party providers that collect users’ location
with timestamp information from individual smartphone application and sell
(or share) these data with a range of end-users researchers. As an example,
the New York Times acquired data on 15 million users in the U.S. from Cuebiq, a location data provider, to quantify the number of people staying home
and changes in travel patterns across the country. Similarly, Unacast has
developed a social distancing score across the U.S. at the county level using
their location data products, which includes an interactive dashboard [36].
Despite the range of data sources used to measure social distancing, many
studies face nontrivial constraints caused by data limitations and methodological challenges. First, previous work is limited to relatively coarse geographical units, such as city, county, or state. In order to quantify and
understand the range of effects of social distancing across socioeconomic and
demographic diversity, observation of changes in activity are needed at higher
spatial resolutions. Second, previous work does not account for land use classifications in determining where activity is occurring, and how those location
shift over time. While POI data can capture visits to certain types of establishments, it does not, by itself, allow for measurement of activity taking
place outdoors, in residential settings, or other places where check-ins may
not occur. Therefore, a scalable metric of neighborhood activity change and
exposure risk is necessary to understand the heterogeneous effects of social
6

distancing on vulnerable communities, to model localized spread of disease,
and to help develop more equitable and effective public health interventions
targeted to at-risk communities.

box extent (40◦ 290 46.000 N 74◦ 150 20.100 W : 40◦ 540 55.900 N 73◦ 420 00.000 W ) and
adjust timestamps to the Eastern Standard Time (EST) zone, resulting in
12,858,781 unique devices. After filtering for devices active for at least 14
days over the study period, the processed dataset includes 744,147 unique
devices, representing approximately 8.9% of the NYC population.
To complement our mobility data, we use a range of ancillary data as described in Table 1 for data analysis and modeling. NYC Primary Land Use
Tax Lot Output (PLUTO) data are used to obtain land use and building type
information for every property in the city. The building footprint shapefile
is used to identify the exact boundaries of individual buildings. NYC LION
data – a single line street base map – are used to extract street segment
geometries. We use daily NYC COVID-19 information by zipcode, which includes confirmed cases, deaths, and positive test rates, provided by the NYC
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). In order to contextualize neighborhood demographic, socioeconomic, housing, and public healthrelated characteristics, we use American Community Survey (ACS) data from
the U.S. Census Bureau, NYC hospital locations from NYC OpenData, and
nursing home data provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
With the exception of the smartphone geolocation data, all data are publicly
available and extracted from NYC or federal open data platforms.
We explore three hypotheses. First, large-scale mobility data can represent neighborhood activity levels over time, and neighborhood social distancing can be measured by changes in this observed activity. Second, disparities
in community activity changes before and after a stay-at-home order are associated with neighborhood socioeconomic and demographic characteristics.
Third, variations in neighborhood social distancing result in disparities in
COVID-19 infections and outcomes, controlling for differences in population
health risk.
3.1. Building the Exposure Density Metric
We introduce exposure density (Ex ρ) as a high spatiotemporal resolution
social distancing metric using large-scale mobility data without identifying
and tracking individual devices. The goal of social distancing is to reduce
the probability of contact between potentially infected and non-infected people; therefore, it can be defined mathematically as the inverse proportion
of human activity density, represented by the number of people in a given
area at a given time. Naively, a lower activity volume, holding spatial area
8

constant, results in lower population density, thus decreasing the probability
of close contacts. However, this metric needs to account for both the volume
of activity in an area and the type of land use where activities occur. For
example, activities in residential buildings can be a measure of people staying
at home, while activities outside of residential buildings are more likely to
increase exposure risk by raising the likelihood of contact with those outside
of the family or household unit. Here, Ex ρ is measured as the number of
unique devices in a given geographical and temporal unit by land use type,
specified as:
Ex ρ = f (Ag,t,L )
(1)
where g is the selected geographical unit (e.g. grid cell or census block group),
t is the temporal unit (e.g. hourly or daily), and L is the land use class.
In order to maintain a scalable and uniform areal unit that can be applied
across different cities and regions, we divide the NYC study area into a 250
m grid (187 x 186 cells) which we use for aggregation of the mobility data.
To enrich the mobility data with land use information, we create a 1 m
resolution raster with the extents and the coordinate system matching the
aforementioned 250 m grid. The land use raster combines the geographical
city limits and land use classification derived from PLUTO data, together
with street and sidewalk boundaries and building footprints for more than
1,000,000 buildings. Each category of land cover is then classified by an
integer (e.g. 10 for residential property, 50 for outdoor open space, and so
on). Each 1 m cell is therefore identified by its index, location and associated
land cover category. This allows us to assign each geolocation data point
from the mobility dataset to a specific land use cell. To estimate population
density, we count the hourly number of unique devices by each 250 m grid
cell and the corresponding land use category based on the raster cell. Our
data processing workflow is visualized in Figure 1. The rasterization process
was implemented in Python and deployed on NYU Center for Urban Science
and Progress’ Research Computing Facility and the activity computation was
performed with PySpark on a Hadoop distributed computing cluster using
NYU’s High Performance Computing platform.
Our 250 m grid cell level measurement can be aggregated into larger
geospatial units in order to estimate neighborhood activities at different
scales. In this work, we use zipcode aggregation to compute neighborhood
activity to align with COVID-19 infection data provided by the DOHMH.

The zipcode aggregated (Ex ρ) is defined as:
Az,g,t,L =

1 X

(2)

where Az,g,t,L is the average number of hourly unique devices in a 250m×250m
grid cell by land use type L in a given zipcode z, and Nz is the number
of grid cells in zipcode z. Based on our social distancing metric, changes
in mobility activity by residential, non-residential, and outdoor land uses
in a neighborhood over the study time period are examined. We filter out
activities from major roads used exclusively by motor vehicles (those without
sidewalks or pedestrian access) to remove vehicular activity within a given
neighborhood.
3.2. Analyzing disparities in exposure density
To understand disparities in exposure density and behavioral responses
to social distancing mandates across neighborhoods, we apply an unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithm based on a pre/post comparative
analysis. We extract (Ex ρ) subsets for two, two-week periods, defined as the
pre-impact period (February 16 through February 29 2020) and the impact
period (March 29 through April 11 2020), to measure changes in (Ex ρ) before and after the state-mandated stay-at-home order. In order to take into
10

account both the absolute change in activity volume and the change in the
proportion of activity type, we create six (6) input variables for the zipcode
clustering analysis specified as:
Achange,z,L =

Apost,z,L −Apre,z,L
Apre,z,L

Pchange,z,L =

Ppost,z,L −Ppre,z,L
Ppre,z,L

(3)

(L ∈ residential, non-residential, and outdoor)
where Achange,z,L is average hourly activity volume change for residential, nonresidential, and outdoor land uses in zipcode z based on the pre-impact period
activity level (Apre,z,L ) and the impact period level (Apost,z,L ). Pchange,z,L
is the average hourly change in activity based on the proportion of those
activities occurring in different land use types. Neighborhood activity by
land use classification is defined as the proportion of activity in a given land
use (residential, non-residential, and outdoors) grid cell.
To identify similarities in the change in (Ex ρ) , we use a Wards’ metricbased agglomerative clustering algorithm, which a widely-used bottom-up
hierarchical unsupervised clustering methods. It begins with each data point
considered as an individual cluster. At each iteration, the closest two clusters
merge with each other based on the proximity matrix measured by Euclidean
distance until all data points form a single cluster [37]. Input data is in the
form of a 177×6 vector – 177 zipcode neighborhoods and 6 features – and the
optimized number of clusters is determined by the corresponding dendrogram
(hierarchical tree diagram) based on the similarities and dissimilarities of the
objects. This clustering process is specified as:
∆(Ci , Cj ) =

X
k∈Ci ∪Cj

k~xk − m
~ Ci ∪Cj k2 −

X
k∈Ci

k~xk − m
~ Ci k2 −

X

k~xk − m
~ Cj k2 (4)

k∈Cj

where ∆(Ci , Cj ) is a merging cost of combining clusters Ci and Cj (distance
between clusters), m
~ C is the centroid of cluster C, and ~xk is an individual
element within a cluster. The resultant clustered neighborhood groups are
then integrated with demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, housing and urban form features, and COVID-19 infection and outcome data.
By using a one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) test and a Tukey’s test
for post-hoc analysis, we identify statistically significant differences between
11

classified groups regarding behavioral responses and associated neighborhood
characteristics.
3.3. Identifying the impact of exposure density and neighborhood behavior
change on infectivity
In order to evaluate the effect of neighborhood behavior changes on
COVID-19 infection rates for the 177 neighborhoods included in the study,
we first measure Pearson correlation coefficients for observed community activity changes before and after the stay-at-home order and disease infection
case rates – daily new confirmed cases per 100,000 people and cumulative
cases per 100,000 people – while accounting for an incubation period.
Then, we develop bivariate and multivariate log-transformed regression
models to identify any statistical significant effect of Ex ρ on infections, controlling for neighborhood characteristics. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models are applied with four (4) dependent variables, representing
four measures of COVID-19 infectivity (Table 2), including case rate, death
rate, positivity rate, and deaths per case. Table 3 provides descriptive statistics for the included independent variables. The bivariate models take Ex ρ
change (as a percent) as a continuous variable to measure the marginal effects of activity change on infection rates. The multivariate models, on the
other hand, use dummy variables for each clustered neighborhood group to
evaluate disparities between groups. The linear models are specified as:
y = β0 + β1 X1 + ε (Bivariate model)
(5)
y = β0 +

Pn

i=1

βi Xi + ε (if n > 1, multivariate model)

where y is the logarithmic transformed zipcode-level COVID-19 outcome

4. Results and Findings
4.1. Changes in exposure density by neighborhood
Citywide and neighborhood hourly activity change by land use type are
presented in Figure 2. The citywide overall activity volume (Figure 2A)
decreased, especially outdoors (sidewalks or parks) and in non-residential
spaces (office and retail), which show significant reductions (20% and 33%
decrease, respectively) after the stay-at-home order when compared to the
pre-COVID baseline. We also observe changes to typical activity peak periods before and after the stay-at-home order. In the pre-COVID period, there
are two peaks (around 8am and 6pm) each weekday, a result of a commute
patterns during rush hour periods. The morning peak, however, is no longer
13

discernible in the post-COVID period as remote work and school closures
reduce commuting activity. In addition to population volume changes, the
analysis of where activity is occurring reveals significant behavior changes
across the City (Figure 2B). We observe residential activities increased by
three percentage points (a +10% change) and non-residential activities decreased by three percentage points (a -13% change) after the stay-at-home
order. This demonstrates both a decrease in overall population, as many residents left the city, and a shift in activities from non-residential and outdoor
areas to residential buildings for those that remained. Figure 2C illustrates
this change in activity (both volume and proportion) for two exemplar neigh-

borhoods. In the case of zipcode 10001 in Midtown Manhattan, the number
of people staying in the neighborhood dramatically decreased by more than
60% with activities of those who remain becoming more evenly distributed
between residential, non-residential, and outdoor land uses. This highlights
the exodus of residents from the city and the reduction in the number of
visitors to the neighborhood. Of those who stayed, more remained at home
than would be expected. Another example neighborhood – zipcode 11364
at the eastern edge of Queens – shows a substantial increase in residential
activity volume and in the proportion of activities occurring in residential
areas.
As transmission risk increases with a greater probability of close contacts
outside of the household or family unit, we quantify Ex ρ based on activities
in non-residential buildings and outdoor areas. We measure the average
number of hourly users per grid cell outside of residential buildings for 177
zipcodes during the pre-impact period and after stay-at-home order. Figure

3 illustrates the percentage change in Ex ρ. There is a 20% citywide decrease
in Ex ρ after the stay-at-home order, but we observe significant disparities
in behavior change across neighborhoods (see Figure 3). For instance, there
is a 50% decrease, on average, in Ex ρ in Manhattan, Long Island City, and
Downtown Brooklyn, while activities in the south area of Staten Island, South
Brooklyn, and the east side of Queens exhibit only minor variations.
4.2. Disparities in neighborhood exposure density
We classify neighborhoods into distinct groups using a hierarchical clustering algorithm based on changes in community activity levels and proportions before and after the stay-at-home order. Figure 4 illustrates the spatial
patterns of the clustering output with associated time series of neighborhood
activity and where (by land use type) that activity is occurring. Descriptive
statistics of input variables and neighborhood features for each group, shown
in Table 4 and Table 5 respectively, reveal distinct neighborhood profiles
based on changes in Ex ρ over time.
Based on this analysis, we identify five (5) neighborhood clusters. Group
1 (21 zipcodes) and Group 2 (21 zipcodes), which we label ”outflow” neighborhoods, are primarily located in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn and
represent substantial changes in Ex ρ after the stay-at-home order. As shown
in Table 4, the average activity volume change for Group 1 and Group 2
is -56.5% and -33.5%, respectively, meaning these two neighborhood groups
experienced nontrivial declines in normal activity levels – across all land use
types – during the pandemic. Most neighborhoods in Group 1 and Group
2 have a higher percentage of younger, non-Hispanic white residents, relatively smaller average household size, and higher incomes and educational
attainment. This indicates residents in these clusters are among the least vulnerable population groups and can afford to leave their home neighborhoods
(or stay at home) by shifting to remote working environments to avoid the
exposure risk, resulting in a decrease exposure density. Even though these
two clusters present similar outflow patterns with respect to neighborhood
activity volume, the activity proportion changes exhibit some notable differences. While the proportion of residential activities in Group 1 increased by
12% without any significant changes in non-residential and outdoor activities,
Group 2 shows a 14% increase in non-residential activity, a function of the
relative pre-COVID resident population size. Therefore, we refine the labels
for Group 1 and Group 2 as “outflow-mixed use” and “outflow-residential”,
respectively.

Group 3 (43 zipcodes) neighborhoods exhibit a 19% decrease, on average,
in exposure density. This is driven by a reduction in population density from
those leaving the city. These neighborhoods maintain a stable proportion

between the different land uses, indicating that the residents who remain in
these communities maintain their regular behavior patterns. When compared
to the “outflow” groups, these “stable-outflow” communities have higher proportions of racial and ethnic minorities, foreign born residents, lower median
income, as well as significantly higher proportions of renter households and
those without health insurance. Additionally, a greater percentage of employees in these neighborhoods work in retail services and healthcare support
occupations, essential businesses that were not required to close during the
18

outbreak. Like Group 3 neighborhoods, communities in the Group 4 cluster
have stable activity patterns over time; however, these neighborhoods did
not see a significant out-mover population. These communities, which we
label “stable-stable”, are comprised of socioeconomically vulnerable households and the highest proportion of racial minorities, coupled with the second
lowest income, large average household size, high unemployment rate, low educational attainment, and a large share of healthcare support workers. Such
socially and economically vulnerable neighborhoods are less likely to be able
to work from home as the character of their occupation requires physical
presence at the workplace, leading to fewer opportunities to reduce exposure
to others. We also find that the relatively modest change in exposure density
in these “stable” groups (18% and 10% decrease in non-residential activity
density for Group 3 and Group 4, respectively) is associated with significantly
higher infection rates. Particularly, the “stable-stable” neighborhood group
shows the highest case rate (2790.36), death rate (224.46), and positivity rate
(0.24) in the City.
In comparison to other clusters, Group 5 (“shelter-in-place”) neighborhoods demonstrate a 20% increase in local activity volume for residential
activities and a 7% increase for outdoor activities. In addition to increasing
neighborhood activity volume, residents staying in these neighborhoods are
found to shift activity to residential buildings (by 10%) and away from nonresidential and outdoor activities (by 6%). While non-residential activities
are found to decrease as a proportion of the three activity types, the increase
in the overall volume of activity leads to a net increase in exposure density. This group has the highest proportion of elderly population, the largest
household size, moderate incomes, a relatively lower percentage of racial and
ethnic minorities, and a significantly higher homeownership rate. This indicates that activity in these neighborhoods, where population density is the
lowest in the city, became more localized. As a result, Group 5 experienced
the second-highest infection rate (2534.96 case rate) in the city.
4.3. Disparities in health outcomes: Effects of exposure density on infection
rates
The number of confirmed cases per 100,000 people (daily new cases and
accumulated cases) on April 15 (five (5) days after the impact period to
account for the virus incubation period) is plotted against the net change in
exposure density before and after the social distancing order, as shown in
Figure 5. We observe an exponential relationship based on the scatter plots

with statistically significant positive correlations between exposure density
and infection rates (ρ = 0.52 and ρ = 0.47, respectively).
The results of the bivariate regression model are shown in Figure 6. Exposure density is found to be correlated with most infection metrics, namely
case rate, death rate, and positivity rate, while, as expected, not being a
statistically significant determinant of mortality rate. These three models
explain 34%, 15%, and 42% of the variance in outcomes, respectively, with
the highest explanatory power exhibited in the positivity rate model. According to the model outputs, a one percentage point decrease in exposure

density is associate with a 1.33% reduction in case rate, a 1.59% in death
rate, and a 1.16% decrease in positivity rate in NYC. Based on these results,
if all neighborhoods reduced activities away from home by 10% as compared
to normal activity levels prior to the stay-at-home order, the City could have
avoided more than 28,000 COVID-19 cases and saved 2,000 lives.
The results of multivariate regression models, which control for neighborhood socioeconomic and demographic covariates, are described in Table 6. We combine both “outflow” groups (“outflow-mixed” and “outflowresidential”) and use the “stable” neighborhood group as the reference case.
After accounting for various demographic characteristics, we continue to observe statistically significant coefficients for the exposure density variables.
The positivity rate model (model 3), shows the most dramatic effects of behavior change and measured health incomes. Neighborhoods that reduced
exposure density are shown to have 13% lower positivity rate compared to the
reference group. For outflow neighborhoods that maintain the distribution
of activities across land use types (classified as the “outflow-stable” group),
the output is a 23% lower positivity rate. A similar pattern is also found in
21

the case rate model (model 1).
Additionally, race and ethnicity, age group, and socioeconomic status are
also found to have statistically significant effects on neighborhood infection
rates and outcomes. Communities with larger proportions of minority and
lower income populations are more likely to be at risk for virus transmission.
For example, for every 10% increase of Hispanic residents in the community,
the positivity rate increases by 5%, the case rate increases by 9%, and the
death rate increases by 6%. This finding holds after accounting for changes
in exposure density. As expected, exposure density is not shown to be a
statistically significant feature in the death rate model (model 2), while the
variables related to the presence of vulnerable populations have significant
negative impact on the survival probability. We find that elderly population,
lack of health insurance coverage, and a high proportion of people living in
public housing have positive and statistically significant associations with
death rates across the city. Thus, the mortality risk of the virus in socially
vulnerable neighborhoods are higher than in other communities, resulting
from pre-existing health conditions and the lack of an adequate healthcare
access. This also explains, in part, why the “outflow-stable” group, with the
highest proportion of lower income residents without health insurance, experienced an approximately 43% higher fatality rate compared to the reference
group, despite observed lower infection rates.
5. Discussion and Conclusion
We present a novel approach to measuring exposure density at high spatial and temporal resolution. By integrating geolocation data and land use
classifications, we are able to establish both the extent of activity in a particular area and the nature of that activity across residential, non-residential,
and outdoor activities. This approach is scalable to any areal unit of interest: here we utilize a 250m grid and aggregate to the zipcode level to match
geography of reported health data. However, it is possible to apply the same
methodology to point locations or grids of any size, and then aggregate the
units to other common administrative or political boundaries, such as census
tracts, counties, and metropolitan areas. We normalize our data to enable
comparative studies between regions and to scale the analysis to other cities
with similar land use data resources.
Our findings demonstrate distinct patterns of activity before and after
the stay-at-home order across neighborhoods. These neighborhood patterns
22

are clustered into five unique groups, each exhibiting statistically significant
variations in socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of residents. In
wealthier neighborhoods of Manhattan and Brooklyn, we observe an exodus
of residents leaving for other areas around NYC or regions further afield.
Presumably, these residents have the means to relocate to second homes or
rental homes that provide a greater degree of (perceived) safety from the
virus. In addition to the financial ability to make such a move, residents in
these neighborhoods also had, in many cases, the option to work remotely,
thus reducing the transaction costs of leaving their primary residence. Conversely, we observed clusters of poor, minority neighborhoods that faced
greater infection risk. While some residents in neighborhoods in the “stable” groups did relocate, the large majority stayed in their communities and
continued on with their typical (pre-COVID) routines. As a result, we found
that the exposure density in these neighborhoods remain relatively constant
over the study period, reflecting the need to commute to work and other
places of responsibility, especially given that many of those employed worked
in occupations deemed essential services. Finally, we find a cluster of neighborhoods that increased their exposure density due to an increased amount
of localized activity. These neighborhoods, characterized by lower density,
single-family homes in areas further from the Manhattan central business
district, are found to have both a greater volume of activity and more activity taking place in non-residential and outdoor areas than normal. The
effect of this local activity was an increase, compared to pre-COVID levels,
in the probability of coming in contact with others outside of the household
or family unit.
The variation in exposure density has a direct and measurable impact on
the risk of infection. In neighborhoods where exposure density decreased the
most, we find lower rates of infection, positivity rates, and death rate per
capita, controlling for other covariates associated with social determinants of
health. The communities hardest hit by the virus were in the “stable-stable”
neighborhoods, where residents faced multiple challenges and risk factors.
In addition to continuing their normal activity patterns, and thus exposing
themselves to greater risk of infection while commuting and in their place
of work, these communities have the largest proportion of minorities, among
the lowest median incomes, and the lowest rate of health insurance coverage.
These compound risks resulted in these vulnerable communities facing the
burden of the highest rate of infection, death rate, and positivity rate in the
City during the study period.
23

Our work highlights the importance of understanding neighborhood activity patterns in evaluating the determinants of health outcomes and risk
factors for future infection outbreaks. By measuring exposure density at
the community scale, we are able to determine the differential behavioral
response to social distancing policies based on local risk factors and socioeconomic inequality. Our results expose the significant disparities in health
outcomes for racial and ethnic minorities and lower income households. Exposure density provides an additional metric to further explain and understand the disparate impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable communities.
