Abstract
In this policy paper, we implement the epidemiological SIR to estimate the basic reproduction number R0 at
national and state level. We also developed the statistical machine learning model to predict the cases ahead of
time. Our analysis indicates that the situation of Punjab (R0 ≈ 16) is not good. It requires immediate aggressive
attention. We see the R0 for Madhya Pradesh (3.37) , Maharastra (3.25) and Tamil Nadu (3.09) are more than
3. The R0 of Andhra Pradesh (2.96), Delhi (2.82) and West Bengal (2.77) is more than the India’s R0 = 2.75,
as of 04 March, 2020. India’s R0 = 2.75 (as of 04 March, 2020) is very much comparable to Hubei/China at the
early disease progression stage. Our analysis indicates that the early disease progression of India is that of similar
to China. Therefore, with lockdown in place, India should expect as many as cases if not more like China. If
lockdown works, we should expect less than 66,224 cases by May 01,2020. All data and R code for this paper is

Introduction

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, as a pandemic.
It will take twelve to eighteen months to develop the vaccine for the COVID-19, [5]. The absence of a vaccine makes
the situation worse for the already overstretched Indian health care system. For example, the number of hospital
beds, per 1000 population, is less than one, [13] - it is just one indicator to cite the miserable situation of India’s
health care system. In the absence of a vaccine, the ‘social distancing’ is the optimal strategy to control the spread of
novel coronavirus, [5]. Other than social distancing, broad base rapid test and cluster tests are essential to identify
those who are infected and isolate them. However, India did not have enough testing capacity as it is reported widely
in media, [2]. Though, Indian scientists recently developed the affordable testing kit for COVID-19, [8]; India needed
a complete overhaul of its health care system in a war footing. In such a situation, India’s Prime Minister Narendra
Modi announced an unprecedented three-weeks nationwide lockdown on the 24th March 2020. The purpose of the
lockdown is to slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus; so that the Govt can take a multi-prong strategy to
add more beds in its network of hospitals, scale up the production of the testing kit of the COVID-19 and personal
protection equipment (PPE) for the health workers. In such a grim scenario, the important question for Indian health
officials is how many new confirmed cases will be seen and by what time; with the hope that the national lockdown
will slow down the spread of the virus; which will buy them time to overhaul of the health care system. However, is
lockdown going to provide the necessary slow down of the virus spread? Even if the lockdown helps India to control
the spread of the virus, it is not economically sustainable to continue the lockdown further, as large the workforce
in India employed in the informal sector as a daily wage laborer. Therefore, in this policy paper, we try to estimate
the effect of lockdown and set up a track following which we will know if the lockdown is working!
In this paper, we develop the epidemiological SIR model and statistical machine learning model to predict disease
progression in India. We implemented the SIR model to estimate the basic reproduction number R0 at the national
and state level. So that we identify which states require more attention. Then we implement the machine learning
model to predict the number of cases ahead of time so Indian administration can be better prepared ahead of time.
In Section (2), we introduce the database, from where the data is downloaded and model is built. In Section (3),
we present the methodology to analyze and predict the data. In Section (4) we present our analysis and prediction
of the Covid-19 disease progression in India. Section (5) concludes the paper with some policy recommendations.

Methodology

Legendary statistician Prof George Box, once said
“All models are wrong, but some are useful”, see [3].
Keeping this in our mind, here in this paper, we take a model agnostic two-prong approach. One is to understand
the severity of the ground situation; and the second is the prediction, which will help the health officials to make the
plans accordingly. The epidemic models for infectious disease yield insights into the dynamic behavior of the disease
spread. With new insights, health officials can develop more effective disease intervention strategies. Besides, such
epidemic models are also used to forecast the course of the epidemic.
In addition to epidemic models, we consider the statistical machine learning (SML) models, which are extremely
good for prediction. Often, the interpretability of SML models is questioned. However, as we take a model agnostic
approach; we can use the epidemic models to understand the ground reality while adopting the SML to achieve
better prediction accuracy.

3.1

SIR Epidemiological Model

The popular epidemic models for an infectious disease is the Susceptible, Infected, Recovered (SIR) model. The
model considers a closed population. To start with, a few infected people are added to the population. It assumes
that the mixing pattern is homogeneous. During the period of the sickness, the contagious people each infect on
average R0 other people, who each then go on to infect R0 others, who are susceptible. The R0 is popularly known
as the Basic Reproduction Number. The R0 is the fundamental quantity of the disease progression, and higher R0
means, more people will tend to be infected in the course of the epidemic. The major advantage of the SIR model
is it gives a number R0 , which can be used to benchmark and compare the ground situation of different states and
resource allocations can be made to those states which are hard hit. The SIR model can be described as,
∂S
∂t
∂I
∂t
∂R
∂t

=
=
=

SI
N
SI
+β
− γI
N
−β

(1)

+γI

where S, I, and R are the number of people in the population that are susceptible, infected and recovered. The β
is the transmission rate. Each susceptible person contacts β people per day; a fraction NI of which are infectious.
Therefore β SI
N move out of the susceptible group and goes into the infected group. The transmission rate is the
average rate of contacts a susceptible person makes that is sufficient to transmit the infection. The parameter γ
is the recovery rate, and γI is the flow out of the infected crowd and goes into the recovered group. The average
duration a person spends in the infected group is γ1 days. For Covid-19, γ1 is around 14 days, see [5].
In this paper, we follow the SIR implementation methodology as described in [12]. Given R0 , β and γ, the
implementation of SIR model is fairly straight forward via deSolve package, a solvers for initial value problems of
1
differential equations, see [10]. It is known that R0 = βγ , see [4]. We considered γ as 14
, from [5]. However, we
need some good estimates of the R0 , so that we can implement the SIR model and predict the disease progression
in India. In order to estimate the R0 , we use the R-package called, ‘R0’, a toolbox to estimate R0 , see [7]. The time
between the infection of a primary case and one of its secondary cases is called a generation time, see [11]. The ‘R0’
package assumes generation time of infection is known and should be provided as input. The mean generation time
2

for the Wuhan has been reported as 6.5 days, [6]. In this paper, we assume the generation time follows Gamma
distribution and we estimated the mean and shape parameter of the Gamma distribution using data. Our estimated
mean generation time for Hubei province turns out to be 6.7, presented in the Table 1. On the recovery from
infection, we assume the individuals are assumed to be immune to re-infection in the short term. This assumption
is same as [5].
Currently, we are deploying a grid search method over the mean and shape of the Gamma distribution for the
time generation process. For a particular choice of the mean (µ) and shape (κ) parameter, we generate the time and
then given that as input we estimate the R0 using the ‘R0’ package in R. Then for an estimated R0 and γ (assumed
to be 1/14), we simulate the disease progression, for the period, for which we observed the new incidences. Then we
calculate the Mean Square Error (MSE) in the following way:
M SE(µ, κ) =

T
2
1 X ˆ
I(t) − iobs (t) ,
T t=1

(2)

ˆ is the new incidence estimated from SIR model described in (1) at time point t, and iobs (t) is the actual
where I(t)
incidence observed in the data at time point t. We estimate the mean parameter µ and shape parameter κ for which
the MSE in (2) is minimum. The, for estimated mean and shape parameter, R0 is estimated using the ‘R0’ package.

3.2

Statistical Machine Learning Model

The infection rate of a typical epidemic reaches its peak and then it slows down. The SIR model predicts when that
peak will be reached very well because it captures the inherent dynamism of the epidemic. However, the SIR model
is not helpful for short and medium-term predictions. We also need short and medium-term prediction, to predict
the cases as quickly as possible so that the health officials can take the appropriate decision. The Statistical Machine
Learning (SML) models are most popular for its prediction accuracy from short to medium term, [9]. Consequently,
SML and SIR models complement each other. Note that the SML does not do well in long term prediction, particularly
it cannot predict when it will reach the peak. Under this understanding, we develop traditional SML models and
not deep learning models. We refrain to develop deep learning type models because we need a lot of data. However,
in epidemiology, we do not have such kind of big data. In addition, the literature on how to adopt deep-learning
for small data is not sufficient yet. Therefore we refrain from developing deep learning models and we develop the
traditional regression type SML model, for short to medium type prediction.
As different countries or provinces population levels are different; we consider the our variable to analyze as cases
per 100,000 (aka., Rate),
Cases
× 100, 000.
Rate =
Population Size
The we model the Rate as a function of time, country and time-country interaction in the following way:
ln{Rateit + 1}

=

β0 + β1 t + β 2 t 2 + · · · + βp t p
+αi + αi t + αi t2 + · · · + αi tp + ,

(3)

where Rateit is the Rate of the ith country at the tth time point, αi is the effect of ith country, αi t is the linear
effect of time on the Rate of the ith country, αi t2 is the quadratic effect of time on the Rate of the ith country. We
considered the following countries in our model: (1) India, (2) China, (3) US, (4) Iran, (5) South Korea, (5) Japan,
(6) Italy, (7) France, (8) Germany, and (9) Spain.

3.3

Model Training Strategy for India to Measure the Effect of the Lockdown

On March 24, 2020, India announced the national lockdown of the nation. To measure the effectiveness of the
lockdown, we used all data up to March 24, 2020, to train the model and learn the parameters of the model. Based
on the trained model, we predict the disease progression path. Since the incubation period of the COVID-19 is about
14 days, it is likely that for 14 days from the beginning of the lockdown, the disease will follow the predicted path
and then, it will deviate down from the predicted path. If the new confirmed cases come below the predicted path
then we will know that is due to the effect of lockdown. On the other hand, if the disease progression stays on the
predicted path then we will know the lockdown did not work. If the disease progression comes above the predicted
path then we can say that the ground situation worsen during the lockdown.

Analysis and Prediction

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is important to develop good predictive models. In the Figure (1), we plot
the case per 100,000 (aka., Rate) for US, EU and Iran. The worst-hit US, EU and Iran’s rates are in the range of
70 and 250. On the other hand, disease progression among Asian countries is very different, see Figure (2). The
disease progression for both India and Japan are similar. We see the exponential rise in India and Japan but at a
very lower rate than the Western nations. China has able to flatten the curve and South Korea was able to curb
the rise from exponential to linear. However, so far South Korea experienced the worst rate among the major four
Asian countries.
Prediction of Disease Progression for India from SML model (3). The solid black vertical line in the Figure
(4) represent the 24 March 2020. The black points left of the vertical black line are confirmed cases till 24 March 2020.
These black points are used in model training. The solid red line is the predicted path of the disease progression.
The blue points are the out of sample test point or the confirmed cases that comes after 24 March 2020. As of 07
April 2020, we don’t see the effect of lockdown. However, if lockdown works - it should shows its effect any time soon
now. The blue point should appear below the predicted red line. In the Table (3), we present the actual prediction
till May 01, 2020. If lockdown works then actual confirmed cases for India should stay below 66,224 by May 01,2020.
A Comparison of R0 between India and China : In the Table (1), R0 with a 95% confidence interval for
Hubei province and China is around 2.5 during the first 23 days from the starting of the Lockdown. India’s R0 with
a 95% confidence interval computed using two different starting points as breakout. One from 02-Mar-2020, because
the number of cases in India started rising from that day. The R0 for India for the first 22 days till the lockdown is
around 2.5, like China. However, if we use the data, till 04-Apr-2020, then the R0 value is around 2.75. It indicates
since the lockdown the situation has worsen. It is also clear from the Figure (4). In the second approach, we consider
India’s breakout from 23-Jan-2020. In that situation, if we consider the data till 24-Mar-2020, the R0 with 95%
confidence is almost 1.9 and if we consider data till 04-Apr-2020, the R0 is nearly 2.1. It means if we use the data
earlier to 02-Mar-2020 the India’s R0 looks better.
In the Figure (3), we compare the incidences of Hubei and India in Figure (3:a) and (3:b). We consider the date
range for Hubei from 23-Jan-2020 to 14-Feb-2020, i.e., during the first 23 days of Hubei lockdown. On the other hand,
we considered the data for India, from the 02-Jan-2020 to 24-Jan-2020, till the lockdown. On the 23-Jan-2020, Hubei
had 444 confirmed cases and overall China had 548 confirmed cases. On 02-Jan-2020, India had only 3 confirmed
cases, whereas on the day of lockdown, i.e., on 24-Jan-2020, India had 536 confirmed cases. So on the day, when the
lockdown starts both India and Hubei and/or China had a comparable number of cases. Perhaps, we should consider
India’s R0 as around 2.5 similar to that of the early stage COVID-19 disease progression of China. Even with the
lockdown, China experienced more than 80,000 cases. Perhaps, we should prepare for at least that many cases if not
more in India.
Stat wise R0 : In Table (2), we present the state wise Basic Reproduction Number, R0 , as of 04 March, 2020. We
see the Punjab’s R0 is worst in the country. Punjab’s high R0 ≈ 16 is likely due to a super spreader, who ignored
advice to self quarantine after returning from a trip to Italy and Germany, see [1]. The situation is Punjab is really
complicated and serious intervention is required. In Figure (5), we present the cases in Punjab over time. Since
March 20, 2020 the number of confirmed cases increased at an unprecedented rate. From Table (2), we see the R0
for Madhya Pradesh (3.37) , Maharastra (3.25) and Tamil Nadu (3.09) are more than 3. Clearly the situations are
complicated in these three states. The R0 of Andhra Pradesh (2.96), Delhi (2.82) and West Bengal (2.77) is more
than the India’s R0 which is 2.75. These seven states should need special attention as their R0 is more than that of
India (2.75). These numbers are as of 4 Apr, 2020. For the following states, we either do not have enough data to
make inference for R0 ; or the algorithm fail to converge: (1) Andaman and Nicobar Islands; (2) Arunachal Pradesh;
(3) Chattisgarh; (4) Goa; (5) Haryana; (6) Jharkhand; (7) Manipur; (8) Mizoram; (9) Odisha; (10) Puducherry.

Discussion

Here we present a point by point discussion of our analysis and prediction.
1. Situation of Punjab (R0 ≈ 16) is bad. It requires immediate aggressive attention.
2. We see the R0 for Madhya Pradesh (3.37) , Maharastra (3.25) and Tamil Nadu (3.09) are more than 3.
Aggressive intervention is needed.
3. The R0 of Andhra Pradesh (2.96), Delhi (2.82) and West Bengal (2.77) is more than the India’s R0 = 2.75.
4. India’s R0 = 2.75 (as of 04 March, 2020) is very much comparable to Hubei/China at the early disease
progression stage.
5. Our analysis indicates that the early disease progression of India is that of similar to China. Therefore, with
lockdown in place, India should expect as many as cases if not more like China.
6. If lockdown works, we should expect less than 66,224 cases by May 01,2020.
