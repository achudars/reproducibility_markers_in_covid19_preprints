Abstract
The Covid-19 pandemic has focused attention on airborne transmission of viruses. Using
realistic air flow simulation, we model droplet dispersion from coughing and study the
transmission risk related to SARS-CoV-2. Although most airborne droplets are 8–16 µm in
diameter, the droplets with the highest transmission potential are, in fact, 32–40 µm. Use of
face masks is therefore recommended for both personal and social protection. We found social
distancing effective at reducing transmission potential across all droplet sizes. However, the
presence of a human body 1 m away modifies the aerodynamics so that downstream droplet
dispersion is enhanced, which has implications on safe distancing in queues. Based on median
viral load, we found that an average of 0·55 viral copies is inhaled at 1 m distance per cough.
Droplet evaporation results in significant reduction in droplet counts, but airborne transmission
remains possible even under low humidity conditions.

INTRODUCTION
The current coronavirus disease outbreak1 is an unprecedented global crisis with confirmed
cases in the millions. The exceptional infectiousness of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has focused attention2 on the nature of its transmission pathways,
with suspicion for an airborne route.3–5 Airborne transmission depends on three main factors,
namely, stability of virus, air circulation and droplet deposition.6 SARS-CoV-2 is found to be
stable in aerosol for up to the three hours of an experiment7 similar to its predecessor SARSCoV-1 which in certain circumstances, achieved airborne transmission.8 Airborne transmission
of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be dismissed even though epidemiological studies giving an R0
between 1 and 2 do not support airborne transmission as the major route of transmission.9
Recent air sampling conducted in airborne infection isolation rooms has found PCR-positive
particles of sizes in excess of 1 μm despite extensive air changes.5
During a cough or sneeze, mucosalivary fluid is expelled into the surrounding air in the form
of droplets.10,11 Droplets greater than 5 μm in diameter are termed as respiratory droplets
whereas those less than 5 μm in diameter are droplet nuclei.12 The size of the droplets affects
the range of dispersal significantly.13 Respiratory droplets tend to settle quickly and
contaminate surrounding surfaces within a short distance,6,14 whereas droplet nuclei can remain
airborne for hours and present a long-range transmission risk.15
As a first line of defence against the pandemic, many countries have adopted what is commonly
known as ‘social distancing’ where individuals are advised, sometimes legally mandated to
maintain a certain distance from other individuals in public. Mathematical models16 suggest
that enforced physical separation could be an effective measure when deployed swiftly during
a viral outbreak,17 based also on simulations of past viral outbreaks.18 The actual recommended
distance varies from 1 m (Singapore), 1.5 m (Australia), 6 feet (CDC, USA) to 2 m (UK).
3

Generally public guidelines range from 1 to 3 m, and the ‘science behind these numbers’, as
policy makers put it, is loosely based on an early seminal work.19 In a recent study based on
turbulent cloud physics, cough droplets are reported to spread up to 7–8 m.20 Further,
researchers at Wuhan hospitals found corona-virus residues in floor samples up to 4 m from
identified sources.21 Hence, even though the rationale behind social distancing is robust,22 there
is clearly no consensus as to what constitutes a safe separation distance, even for health workers
treating infected patients.23
Fluid dynamics plays an important role in almost every aspect of this pandemic.24 A brief
survey of cough dispersion studies25 yields theoretical puff model11 and plume model26,
supported by visualization techniques such as schlieren27, shadowgraph28, and particle image
velocimetry29,30. Notably, numerical methods, such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
based on Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models31 produce high
resolution flow fields and concentration data,32 which not only compensate for slow
instrumental speeds of analytical techniques,25 but are also adaptable to different environments
and scenarios, such as passengers in an aircraft cabin,33 and more recently, a cough dispersion
study in an outdoor environment under significant wind speeds,34 whose results are useful in
integrated transmission modeling.35
It is important to note that droplet dispersion model may infer transmissibility but not the actual
infection risk. That will take an infectious dose, which refers to the number of viral particles to
establish an infection in half of individuals, which depending on the type of virus.36 Risk
assessment of airborne infection should also account for actual viral transport.
In this study, we performed numerical simulations of droplet dispersion from a single cough
based on single person and two person settings under realistic indoor conditions and assess
viral transmission through airborne droplets.

METHODS
Droplet dispersion model
We consider a standing person who initiates a sudden, involuntary cough in an indoor
environment. For reference we shall label the person the ‘Cougher’. Our objective here is to
assess the droplet dispersion potential under representative conditions: slight breeze from
behind towards the Cougher at a speed 0·3 m/s, an ambient air temperature of 25 °C and a
relative humidity of 60% (typical humidity in an air-conditioned environment). As detailed in
the Supplementary Information, the model cough is inclined downwards at an average of
27·5°,37 follows a characteristic air flow pattern33,37 at breath temperature of 36°C, and emits a
cluster of droplets with a standard size distribution11,38 and viral loading39. The Cougher model
is based on a standard human 1·7 m tall (average height for a Singaporean male) with open
arms who begins normal breathing cycles immediately after the cough.
Separately, we consider the case of two persons, with the other labelled the ‘Listener’. The
Listener model, positioned either 1 or 2 meters away from the Cougher, is based on a standard
human 1·59 m tall (average height for a Singaporean female) with arms closed and she begins
normal breathing cycles immediately at the start of the cough.
Using Eulerian-Lagrangian model, we solve numerically for Newtonian air flow, temperature,
species and droplet trajectories in space and time, using finite volume method implemented on
ANSYS FLUENT (2019R3). First, steady state Eulerian simulations with species transport are
performed for humid air flow and heat transport within the domain. Then using steady state
solutions as input, simulations are repeated using discrete phase model, where transient
momentum and heat transfer are included in Lagrangian tracking of droplet trajectories.
5

Droplets are assumed stable and do not experience breakup. The governing equations and
computational details are available in the Supplementary Information.

Viral transmission analysis
We collect all droplets past designated distances, specifically 0·5, 1·0, 1·5 and 2·0 m from the
source and characterize their respective size distributions time-averaged up to 10 s since the
onset of the cough, and adjusted for wind speed (0·3 m/s). The droplet count probability is a
probability function obtained by taking the ratio of the number of droplets of a certain size and
the width of the corresponding size interval based on the original size histogram.38 To assess
viral transmission potential, we calculate the number of viral copies found in each droplet in
terms of the viral load (copies per volume). The median viral count probability is a probability
distribution obtained by taking the product of median SARS-CoV-2 viral load (3·3×106
copies/mL)39 and the droplet count probability distribution. The viral loading found in saliva
is assumed to be homogeneously distributed among droplets emitted during a cough.

Risk assessment
To assess the extent of exposure, we collect droplets deposited on the Listener model surfaces,
over the entire body (surface area 1·43 m2) and the mouth region (3·5 cm2), assuming mouth
breathing, and including normal breathing cycles. Separately, we include a scenario where the
Listener is wearing a mask (aspect ratio 1·43) and account for droplets landing on the mask
(288 cm2). The droplet deposition count probability is a probability function obtained by taking
the ratio of the number of deposited droplets of a certain size and the interval of that size based
on the original size histogram.38 The median viral deposition count probability is a probability
6

distribution obtained by taking the product of median SARS-CoV-2 viral load (3·3×106
copies/mL)39 and the droplet deposition count probability distribution. Total deposited viral
counts are obtained by integrating the respective median viral count probability distributions
within size distribution limits (2–100 µm). Pulmonary deposition efficiency is not considered,
since all droplets are in micron size range and do not escape readily via exhalation.40 In
addition, we do not distinguish between exposure to ingested or inhaled droplets, and trapped
droplets do not re-entrain.

RESULTS
Droplet dispersion
For the base case with a single Cougher, Figure 1 shows snapshots of 2–100 µm droplet
dispersion up to 10 s following a cough, side and top-down view, without (top) and with
evaporation physics (bottom). Generally, larger droplets (in red) separate from the cloud and
settle in seconds with a dispersion range of barely 1 m; smaller droplets (in blue) are buoyant
and spread over large distances but may also evaporate rapidly into residues known as droplet
nuclei.19 For non-evaporative case (Figure 1; top), the droplet cloud starts off as a fast moving
puff11 from the oral region but quickly disperses into a plume26 inclined at an angle from 14°
to 10° (10 s) from the chest. Top-down view shows that the lateral droplet dispersion in depth
is relatively constant, and by inspection, the plume can be effectively confined within a 20°
forward wedge. Droplets near the sides of the virtual wedge travel faster than those near the
center due to entrainment of air flow into the wake.

7

Figure 1. Droplet dispersion (side and top-down views) from a single cough inclined
downwards at 27·5° for non-evaporative (top) and evaporative (bottom) cases at relative
humidity of 60%. Color bar indicates droplet sizes (2–100 µm). Vertical lines are spaced 1 m
apart and arrows are drift markers based on a background wind speed of 0·3 m/s. Ambient air
temperature is 25°C and breath temperature is 36°C. Plume angles 14–10° from the chest 10 s
after the cough and lateral dispersion fits a 20° forward wedge.

For the evaporative case, significant reduction in droplet counts is observed seconds from the
cough (Figure 1; bottom). At relative humidity of 60%, the lifetime of a droplet 10–100 µm is
in the order of seconds (Supplementary Figure S2). Small droplets rapidly evaporate into
droplet nuclei, which continue to remain airborne for a long time due to their small size. As
evaporating droplets decrease in size, the settling times are increased, resulting in a horizontal
8

plume at hip level. Droplets are also observed to become more mono-disperse (a decrease in
diversity of droplet sizes) compared to non-evaporative case. Top-down view shows minimal
lateral dispersion for the remaining droplets. Taking the 20° forward wedge plume from the
non-evaporative case, it is likely that evaporated droplets, or droplet nuclei, would follow
similar dispersion trends.
The droplet count probability depends on the droplet size distribution and distance from the
Cougher (Figure 2). The mode of the distribution lies between 8 and 16 µm; closer to 8 µm at
short distances (<1 m) but closer to 16 µm at longer distances. Increase in distance results in
reduction of droplet counts across all droplet sizes. Interestingly, we find that droplets between
32 and 40 µm represent the highest transmission potential in terms of droplet sizes. Fewer in
numbers compared to 8–16 µm droplets, these 32–40 µm droplets contain much higher viral
counts due to their larger volumes. Larger droplets greater than 75 µm contain even higher
viral count per droplet, but they tend to settle rapidly and therefore present little airborne
transmission potential except under strong wind conditions.34

Droplet count probability. Mode: 8–16 µm. B) Median viral count probability based on
median viral load (3·3×106 copies/mL)39. Mode: 32–40 µm. Droplets larger than 75 µm have
low airborne transmission potential despite high viral counts.

Exposure to virus via droplets depends on distancing, as well as wind speed and direction
(Figure 3). For 0·5 m distancing without evaporation, the median viral count accumulates
rapidly to 80 in less than 1 s due to high velocity droplet transport from the cough jet, which is
substantially faster than the background wind drift. Between 5 to 9 s, viral counts are elevated
from 100 copies up to 147 due to the passage of a cloud of large droplets drifting close to the
ground before settling (Figure 1; 5–7.5 s); these droplets contain high viral counts. As
distancing increases, the droplets become more wind dispersed, in this case, at a wind speed of
0·3 m/s. In particular, it takes approximately 7 s for viruses to be projected over a distance of
2 m. This delay may provide sufficient time for simple reactive measures, such as stepping
away or wearing a surgical mask.

10

Figure 3. Median viral count collected at indicated distances from source in time, for cases
A) without evaporation and B) with evaporation at relative humidity of 60%. Evaporated
droplets persist as droplet nuclei which may pose infection risk over extended distance and
time scales. Vertical lines along the abscissa denote the time required for wind drift to cover
the indicated distance (m).

For the evaporative case with 0·5 m distancing, the median viral count accumulates rapidly to
70, then decreases as smaller droplets with lifetimes under 1 s evaporate into nuclei. Between
4·5 to 8 s, viral count increases from 33 copies up to 121 also due to the passage of a cloud of
large droplets drifting close to the ground. Compared to the non-evaporative case, this increase
is more significant, because large droplets tend to evaporate slowly compared to small ones
(Supplementary Information), and as droplet lifetimes are increased as they shrink in size and
they remain airborne for longer periods of time. In addition, the non-volatile components are
conserved, so the viral loads (in copies per unit volume) in evaporating droplets are higher than
the original viral loads released from the source. Upon complete droplet evaporation, viruses
11

persist in the dry residue as airborne nuclei, which continue to pose infection risks over
extended distance and time. Here, the viral counts shown in Figure 3 represents droplet
transmission and excludes viruses contained in airborne nuclei.
The number of viral copies required to establish an infection in half of individuals, or Infectious
Dose (ID), is wide-ranging and depends significantly on the type of virus. The ID for SARSCoV-2 is currently unknown but expected to be small, based on how fast the virus has spread
globally. Since the viral load sampled from patients on admission day is more than 17 times
the median load,39 reading off at a rescaled viral dose of ~6 (100/17) would suggest significant
infection probabilities.

Two persons separated by 1 m
For 1 m distancing, Figure 4 shows snapshots of 2–100 µm droplet dispersion up to 10 s
following a cough, side and top-down view, without (top) and with evaporation (bottom). With
a Listener model as an obstacle to air flow, the aerodynamics is modified so that the droplet
plume is elevated and its angle is now horizontal from the Cougher’s chest level up to 10 s
following the cough. The presence of the Listener at 1 m has effectively increased the
dispersion range of the droplet plume, with practical consequences. Observe that the head of
the Listener is engulfed by the droplet plume when it should not be at that distance (Figure 1).
Also, now since air has to move around the Listener, the lateral dispersion length is now defined
by the characteristic width of the Listener (shoulder to shoulder), which by inspection, results
in a 30° wedge, instead of the 20° wedge previously obtained for single Cougher case (Figure
1). Further downstream, the lateral plume angle is horizontal and as before, the droplets further

12

from the center travel faster than those near the center due to entrainment of air in the Listener’s
wake.

Figure 4. Droplet dispersion (side and top-down views) from a single cough inclined
downwards at 27·5° for non-evaporative (top) and evaporative (bottom) cases at relative
humidity of 60%. Listener is 1 m away facing Cougher. Color bar indicates droplet sizes (2–
100 µm). Arrows represent drift markers based on a background wind speed of 0·3 m/s.
Ambient air temperature is 25°C and breath temperature is 36°C. Plume is aligned
horizontally from the chest up to 10 s after the cough and lateral dispersion fit a 30° forward
wedge.

13

For the evaporative case, significant reduction in droplet counts is observed seconds from the
cough (Figure 4). Unlike the non-evaporative case, the dispersion of evaporating droplets is
found to be relatively unaffected by the presence of the Listener. Dispersion of droplet nuclei
is expected to follow air streamlines due to their small sizes.
Figure 5 shows the air flow field with Listener 1 m away at 0·1 and 5·0 s from the cough. At
the mouth level, the velocity field is initially dominated by the high velocity air jet from the
cough. Both the width of the cough jet and the decay of jet speed fall within expected ranges
reported in experimentally measured cough profiles.41 At the waist level, the flow field is
unaffected by the cough jet.

magnitude. Top panels: side view (center plane); middle panels: top-down view (crosssection at Cougher mouth level); Bottom panels: top-down view (cross-section at Cougher
waist level) reveals steady flow fields.

Two persons separated by 2 m
For 2 m distancing, Figure 6 shows droplet dispersion up to 10 s following a cough, for both
side and top-down views, without (top) and with evaporation (bottom). With the Listener now
further away, the droplet plume reverts to the base case scenario (Figure 1), where it is inclined
from 14° to 10° from the chest level of the Cougher up to 10 s. Closer to the Listener, however,
the plume realigns horizontally as air wraps around the chest level. Top-down view shows that
the lateral plume is now confined within a 20° forward wedge (instead of 30° for 1 m
distancing), since the width of the Listener is smaller than the characteristic width of the wake
at that distance. The chest presents a wider obstacle to droplet dispersion compared to the head
(Figure 1), resulting in a droplet-free wake further downstream from the Listener. For the
evaporative case, the dispersion of evaporating droplets is similarly unaffected by the Listener
at 2 m.

background wind speed of 0·3 m/s. Ambient air temperature is 25°C and breath temperature

wedge.

Droplet deposition and viral transmission
Figure 7 shows that most of the droplets deposit on the body surface, and only a small fraction
on the mouth region, which are inhaled or ingested. The modes for body deposition are 8–16
16

µm at 1 m and 16–24 µm at 2 m; the average mode for mouth and mask deposition is 4–8 µm
at both distancing. Although the number of droplets deposited on the mouth (inhaled) is less
than on the body, the deposition efficiency (per unit area) is substantial since the surface area
of the mouth region is only 0·02% of the entire body. The droplet Stokes number ranges from
10-6 for 2 µm droplet to 0.002 for 100 µm droplet.

Figure 7. Droplet and virus deposition on the surfaces of the Listener model, including body
(1·43 m2), mouth (3·5 cm2) and mask (288 cm2). A) Droplet deposition count probability.
Modes: 8–16 µm (body; 1 m), 16–24 µm (body; 2 m) and 4–8 µm (mouth/mask). B) Median
viral deposition count probability (3·3×106 copies/mL)39. Modes: 32–40 µm (body; 1 m) and
24–32 µm (body; 2 m). Inset shows viral deposition count probabilities for mouth and mask.
Mode: 16–24 µm (mouth/mask; 1 m). For 1 m distancing, the total deposited viral counts on
the Listener model are 25·3 (body), 0·55 (mouth) and 0·72 (mask).

During the inhalation half cycle (Supplementary Figure S1), droplets are transported by the air
intake into the mouth where they may be ingested, inhaled or exhaled. Droplet deposition on
17

the mask is enhanced due to breathing cycles. Inhaled droplets are generally smaller (mode: 4–
8 µm) in size compared to those deposited on the Listener’s body (mode: 8–24).
The median viral deposition count probability based on SARS-CoV-2 viral load (3·3×106
copies/mL)39 shows significant viral deposition on the body surface (Figure 7). Interestingly,
the highest viral counts found on the body are deposited by droplets of sizes 32–40 µm at 1 m
and 24–32 µm at 2 m, which is the opposite trend for droplet counts (8–16 µm at 1 m; 16–24
µm at 2 m). This is because large droplets 32–75 µm settle preferentially at distance 1–2 m,
leading to significant reductions in viral counts. Total deposited viral counts are 25·3 viral
copies on the Listener’s body, 0·72 on mask, and 0·55 on mouth (inhaled). When extrapolated
to Day-0 viral load,39 the inhalation exposure increases to 9·3 copies, which remains lower than
the Infectious Dose (ID) of most common viruses. Increasing distancing to 2 m results in
significant reductions in viral deposition counts on the body and transmission risks from droplet
inhalation.

DISCUSSION
Young children may be at greater risk from droplet transmission compared to adults (Figure
1). Inspection of the droplet plume shows maximum droplet count densities at characteristic
heights at 1·2 m for 1 m distancing, and 1·0 m for 2 m. A useful guideline for height-related
risk would be within a height difference of 50 cm at a distance of 1 m, and 70 cm a distance of
2 m, depending on the height of the Cougher.
Most airborne droplets are 8–16 µm in diameter, but droplets with the highest transmission
potential are, in fact, 32–40 µm, due to their higher viral content (Figure 2). Surgical masks are

18

known to be effective at trapping these larger droplets, so they are recommended for use as
necessary.
Our results suggest that social distancing is generally effective at reducing droplet counts across
all droplet sizes. Specifically, an increase in distancing from 0.5 m to 1 m significantly reduces
potential exposure to large droplets greater than 75 µm, and further increase in distancing to 2
m further halves the transmission potential across all droplet sizes. Understanding the
infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to quantitative risk assessment.
Under low humidity conditions, small droplets evaporate rapidly in a fraction of a second,
whereas moderately large droplets can persist over a few seconds and remain airborne (Figure
3). Evaporated droplet residues, or nuclei, contain high viral densities and present long ranged
airborne transmission risks. Smaller and lighter, these droplet nuclei contain viral residues in a
compact form and could remain airborne for long period of time, projecting transmission risks
over long distances. The effect of desiccation on the viability of SARS-CoV-2 found in droplet
nuclei is currently not well understood.
Interesting aerodynamics come into play when a person obstructs the airflow downstream from
the cough (Figure 4). Counter-intuitively, the person being 1 m away from the cough may not
only fail to obstruct the plume itself, but instead enhance its dispersion range further
downstream. This suggests that a 1 m distancing rule between individuals in a queue may have
adverse consequences.
The airflow result for 1 m distancing also has practical consequences for face shield users.
Based on our modelling results, the droplet plume for a person at 1 m follows the air flow over
the chest (Figure 4), so the droplets reach the face region from a bottom-up direction which
circumvents the face shield. Therefore, the face shield may be ineffective as a protection against
19

droplets based on aerodynamic considerations. An improvement to the face shield design could
be a chin plate that prevents air flow from the chest upwards; air could instead be drawn in
from the back of the head around the sides.
Based on median viral load, an average of 0·55 viral copies is inhaled 1 m away from a single
cough. This seemingly low figure could still be amplified through successive coughs at higher
viral loads and accumulated over time. Droplets deposited on skin and clothes could still lead
to secondary transmission modes such as face touching.
The present study has several limitations. First, the cough model is idealized. The droplet size
distribution is based on 22 cough tests and measurements of some 3,000 droplets captured on
slides38 and the cough airflow based on 25 test subjects.37 These sources, while representative,
do not account for significant variations in coughing intensity and duration.42 Second, droplets
emitted through vocalization and sneezes are not considered in this study. Third, the height of
the Cougher can affect the dispersive range of droplets, especially larger droplets which tend
to settle rapidly on emission. This effectively increases the droplet transmission potential from
taller infected persons. Fourth, a light prevailing wind with constant speed is assumed for
indoor conditions, but wind speed significantly affects the dispersion range of droplet. Under
outdoor conditions, wind speeds can reach up to several meters per second, leading to
dispersion ranges that exceed currently accepted social distances even under strongly
evaporative conditions.34 Fifth, this study does not distinguish between viable and non-viable
viruses, only viral count and load. Sixth, the evaporation physics used here is based on weak
coupling between droplets, so droplets evaporate rapidly into smaller droplet nuclei which
persists airborne. A separate study on the evaporation of droplets with non-volatile content is
currently in progress.

20

From our data, we conjecture that the concept of “airborne” or “droplet” transmission as
applied to a respiratory pathogen may be relative. Physical factors, such as wind speed and
direction, interact with biological ones, such as infectious dose, to determine the likelihood
with which the coughing sick infect others in their immediate vicinity.

Cough characterization
Based on established cough patterns, the standard cough is modelled as a planar jet inclined
downwards at an angle 27.5° averaged between 15° and 40° angular limits of a typical cough
jet.1 The mouth opening area is 4 cm2, a time-averaged value based on mouth opening data
during a cough.1 The flow velocity during cough (Supplementary Figure S1) is derived from
the flow rate data based on cough tests.1,2 At the end of the cough cycle, breathing cycle begins,
modelled here as a sinusoidal function with a period of 6 s and amplitude of 0.73 m/s.
Accordingly, characteristic Reynolds numbers for cough is approximately 13,000 and for
normal breath 1,000. Breath temperature is assumed to be 36°C.

Supplementary Figure S1. A) Airflow velocity during modelled cough cycle. B) Breathing
cycles for Cougher and Listener. For the Cougher, the breathing cycle begins at the end of the
cough cycle.

The size distribution of droplets emitted in a cough is reproduced from a seminal study by
Duguid3, as shown in Supplementary Table S1. More recent measurements, carried out using
different methods and under different conditions, reported size distributions that are
predominantly skewed towards larger droplets (50–100 µm)42,5. These distributions may not
sufficiently represent smaller droplet sizes emitted during a cough.11

Based on saliva samples of hospitalized patients, the median SARS-CoV-2 viral load is found
to be 3.3×106 copies/mL, with a range from 9.2×102 to 2.0×108 copies/mL.39 Day-0 viral
loading from admission day samples was reported to be 5.7×107 copies/mL and this sets the
transmission risk limit for our modelled source. Assuming that salivary viral loading rates are
conserved in droplets emitted during a cough, the viral content in a droplet can be determined
depending on its size. Droplets with diameters greater than 100 µm neglected in this study due
to their extremely fast settling rates and low dispersion potential.
For modelling purposes, droplets are generated based on discrete size distributions and injected
randomly within mouth region at the start of the simulation.

Governing equations
The problem mentioned above is governed by fluid flow, droplet movement as well droplet
evaporation for the evaporation scenario. The governing equations then include Navier-Stokes
equation, proper turbulent flow model as well as discrete phase movement and droplet
evaporation equations, respectively.

Evaporation model
The evaporation model is verified in independent tests on 1, 10 and 100 µm droplets under
relative humidity levels 0, 0.6 and 0.8 (Supplementary Figure S2). At relative humidity 0.6, a
10 µm droplet evaporates completely in 0.2 s, and a 100 µm in 2 s, which is comparable to
simulation time scales, so evaporation is clearly an important factor in droplet dispersion. We
compare our evaporation model against other studies and find agreement on droplet
34

evaporation times across droplet sizes, based on Reynolds numbers, humidity and temperature
gradients.12,13

Computational details
The simulation domain is a rectangular box with dimensions of 10·1 m (length) × 7·12 m
(width) × 5·4 m (height). Computational meshing is conducted directly on ANSYS FLUENT
(2019R3) using polyhedral unstructured scheme. The human model is geometrically meshed
as a static obstacle 1·7 m with open arms. Additional mesh refinement is implemented using
double boundary layers near geometric surface of the human models. The number of mesh
elements is approximately 3·9 million.

35

Simulations are run on standalone workstation with 88 hyper-threaded CPUs and 384G RAM.
Each job is assigned 12 CPUs and 64G RAM and resolves 30 s of simulation time in
approximately 24 h real time.
