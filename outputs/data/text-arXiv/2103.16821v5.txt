We study a stochastic behavior of aerosols by the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics approach
using the analytical approach of the Langevin equation. We firstly show that superdiffusion can
possibly occur right after the emission, which may be attributed to the physical mechanism of the
outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also provide clear evidence of the least required distance
to prevent infections occurred by aerosols. In particular, the required distance to prevent aerosol
infections is derived to be about 42 m when we assume Cauchy distribution as an initial velocity
distribution. This fact implies that due to superdiffusion the aerosol infection can occur even far
away from a long distance as compared to the previous considerations.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Diffusion is one of the important issues in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, such as the behavior
of a drop of ink spreading into water. This phenomenon
is observed not only in physical phenomena but also
in biological phenomena. Okubo and Umeno studied
the phenomenon of diffusion in dynamical systems [1].
They showed that in systems with a Hamiltonian with
time-reversibility, an irreversible behavior occurs in the
course of time. Alexander analyzed the invasion of cancer cells in tissues using the diffusion equation with real
derivatives, and observed superdiffusion [2]. P.Siegle et.al
numerically studied a minimal non-Markovian model of
superdiffusion which originates from long-range velocity
correlations within the generalized Langevin equation approach [3].
In this Letter, we investigate the diffusion phenomenon
of aerosols. Aerosols are many particles dispersed in gas,
discussed in different fields of variant researches, such as
environmental problems, air purification, medical applications, and so on [4]. These studies are mostly based
on experimental or theoretical approaches and simulation approaches of fluid dynamics. One of the most general issues on aerosol dynamics is droplets generated by
sneezes. Silwal et.al determine how many aerosols are
dispersed by each type of pronunciation [5]. Bourouiba
et.al photographed the behavior of the aerosols generated
by a sneeze [6]. Fluid dynamics simulations are used to
investigate the difference in the degree of aerosol diffusion
with and without a mask [7].
However, aerosol infection can occur even far away
from a long distance and the model which explain this

phenomenon is necessary. We discuss the behavior of
aerosols from the viewpoint of stochastic processes, which
is different from the previous studies. Our findings provide an evidence that the degree of diffusion of aerosols
well describes the actual phenomena, and show that an
approach based on stochastic processes is also effective
for analyzing aerosol dynamics. Furthermore, if the initial distribution of velocity is a Cauchy distribution, it
is theoretically expected that superdiffusion occurs right
after a sneeze.

II. CALCULATING THE DISTRIBUTION OF
POSITION USING LANGEVIN EQUATION OF
VELOCITY

We can obtain the distribution of their positions from
the Langevin equation for their velocity [10].
Langevin equation for velocity of a particle of mass m
is
u̇(t) = −f u + R(t)/m
where f is a friction coefficient of a particle and R(t) is
a white noise, hR(t1 )R(t2 )i = 2mf kT δ(t1 − t2 ). When
the initial distribution of a velocity is a normal distribution with its average U and standard deviation V0 =
tan 10◦
U [15], the result is

why we consider the Cauchy distribution is based on the
following fact: when we launch particles uniformly and
randomly at the plate with respect to the angle, the number of particles on the plate follows Cauchy distribution.
To examine the distribution of positions, we calculate the

If we ignore the second term, we can derive the Cauchy

The properties of the distribution are preserved after

6. The mean free path of the aerosol lp
The mean free path corresponds to the expected
distance that a particle travels between two collisions [16]. Collisions between aerosol particles are
negligible. We assume that the volume of exhaled
air is 0.001 m3 [17]. Since the mean free path cannot be uniquely determined for a non-equilibrium
system, we calculate the velocity and particle size
distribution of aerosols at the moment of sneezing.
The result of the calculation is shown in TABLE
III.
TABLE III. Aerosol particle diameter dp µm and the mean
free path lp m due to collisions of air constituent molecules.
The notation of the numbers is in significant figures, e.g. 6.3e3 represents 6.3 × 10−3 .

140 5.4 × 10−19
200 2.6 × 10−19

When the diameter of an particle dp is 200µm, we
f kT t
= 6.8 × 10−14 t. This means that the

second term of Eq. (2) is negligible in this numerical estimation.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS

In this paper, we investigate the kinetics of aerosols
generated by sneezes from the viewpoint of stochastic
processes and then compare with the mean free path.
In deriving the probability distribution for position from
the Langevin equation for velocity, we show that when
the initial distribution is Cauchy, superdiffusion occurs
immediately after emission. It means that aerosols can
spread very widely in a short time, which is consistent
with the fact that COVID-19 pandemic was spread to
all over the world in a short period in 2020. By using
the results from the calculation using Cauchy distribution as an initial velocity distribution, we find that the
required distance to prevent aerosol infection is about 42
m. Alternatively using Gaussian distribution as an initial
velocity distribution, our analytical estimation based on
non-equilibrium statistical mechanics shows that the required distance is about 14 m, which is even greater than
the several meter-scale that has been previously reported
in the world. The results also indicate that the required
distance is sufficiently larger than that of the mean free
path and that the larger aerosol particles cause the farther dispersion. As a future study, the results obtained
by fluid dynamics approach [6] need to be derived even
from the approach of this study.
