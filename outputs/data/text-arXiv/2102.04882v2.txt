Face masks have been widely used as a protective measure against COVID-19. However, prepandemic empirical studies have produced mixed statistical results on the effectiveness of masks
against respiratory viruses. The implications of the studies’ recognized limitations have not been
quantitatively and statistically analyzed, leading to confusion regarding the effectiveness of masks.
Such confusion may have contributed to organizations such as the WHO and CDC initially not
recommending that the general public wear masks. Here we show that when the adherence to
mask-usage guidelines is taken into account, the empirical evidence indicates that masks prevent
disease transmission: all studies we analyzed that did not find surgical masks to be effective were
under-powered to such an extent that even if masks were 100% effective, the studies in question
would still have been unlikely to find a statistically significant effect. We also provide a framework
for understanding the effect of masks on the probability of infection for single and repeated exposures. The framework demonstrates that more frequently wearing a mask provides super-linearly
compounding protection, as does both the susceptible and infected individual wearing a mask. This
work shows (1) that both theoretical and empirical evidence is consistent with masks protecting
against respiratory infections and (2) that nonlinear effects and statistical considerations regarding
the percentage of exposures for which masks are worn must be taken into account when designing
empirical studies and interpreting their results.

In 1910, one of the first western-trained Chinese physicians adapted surgical masks for use against a respiratory
plague that killed more than 60,000 people in four months [1]. The logic behind their function is transparent: a mask
can block some viral or bacterial particles from entering and/or dispersing from the wearer’s respiratory tract. They
have been used for prevention in a wide range of disease outbreaks and medical settings, and there is currently a
general consensus that surgical and cloth masks help prevent infected individuals from spreading COVID-19 [2, 3].
Surprisingly, given the logic of their utility, there is less of a consensus that surgical/cloth masks also protect the
wearer and many government health organizations did not initially recommend wearing them during the early months
of the COVID-19 pandemic [4, 5].
It is well established that surgical and cloth masks partially block virus-containing airborne droplets of various
sizes [6–15]. Cloth masks, surgical masks, respirator masks (e.g. N95), and powered air-purifying respirators are
understood to be capable of providing increasing levels of protection. The amount of virus transmitted between
an infected and a susceptible individual is therefore expected to be reduced if either is wearing a mask, with both
wearing masks giving the best protection. However, this straightforward inference has been difficult to establish in
experimental studies. Here we analyze why some experimental studies find masks to be effective while others do
not. We determined that the studies that did not find surgical masks to be effective were under-powered to such an
extent that even if the masks were 100% effective, they still would have been unlikely to find a statistically significant
result. Statistical power is the probability that a study will find a statistically significant result if its intervention does
in fact have a certain effect. Our results concerning the statistical power of mask studies are summarized in fig. 1,
which shows that all studies that had a large enough sample size and/or adherence for 80% power (above and to
the right of the gray lines) show a statistically significant reduction in infections among mask-wearers. As would be
expected, most studies with less statistical power (towards the lower left) did not find a statistically significant effect.
We also provide a framework for understanding the nonlinear effects of mask-wearing on the probability of infection.
Experiments that do not take such factors into account provide misleading results unless interpreted carefully. While
the precautionary principle [16, 17] would recommend the use of masks during the COVID-19 pandemic in any case
(due to the asymmetric risks of using vs. not using masks), the analyses we provide gives consistency to theoretical
analyses, experimental studies, and epidemiological recommendations.

FIG. 1. The effective adherence and sample sizes of studies that found masks to be effective (red triangles) and those that did
not (blue squares). Empirical studies with higher levels of statistical power consistently show that masks protect the wearer;
studies with lower statistical power are mixed, as would be expected. The statistical power depends on the sample size, the
effective adherence (i.e. mask effectiveness multiplied by the fraction of exposures for which masks are on average worn in the
mask group), and probability of being infected without a mask in the setting of the study. Each curve depicts the required
sample size (expressed as the expected number of infections in the non-mask group) as a function of effective adherence in order
for the study to have a power of 80%, i.e. an 80% probability of finding a statistically significant result (p < 0.05, two-tailed).
The curves are calculated assuming equal-sized non-mask and mask groups, with each curve representing a different probability
of infection in the non-mask group; the total sample size is thus the expected number of infected individuals in the non-mask
group (which is what is plotted) divided by the probability of infection and then multiplied by two. We assume that the
probability of infection is reduced linearly with increasing effective adherence (see fig. 2); this assumption will underestimate
the true necessary sample size. The scattered data points depict the size and effective adherence of studies taken from a
recent systematic review [18]; the study numbers correspond to those in the first column of fig. 5. The effective adherence for
the studies are overestimated by assuming that masks are 100% effective; even with this assumption, the studies numbered 1
through 14 were found to have less than 80% statistical power. Note that the power of the studies (reported in fig. 5) depend
on the probability of infection in the non-mask group and the size of the mask group in addition to the information present in
this figure; the location of the studies in this figure relative to the curves should therefore be considered only approximately. In
particular, some of the studies have smaller overall sample sizes than implied by this figure, due to their non-mask and mask
groups not being equal in size. Mathematical details can be found in the Appendix.

STATISTICAL POWER

Some empirical studies find masks to be effective in preventing disease transmission while others do not [16, 18–23].
However, due to poor statistics, even the studies with negative results are not inconsistent with masks being highly
effective. While some of the studies conducted a power analysis to estimate the sample size required to obtain a
statistically significant result with 80% probability (i.e. to achieve 80% power, the standard level by convention),
these power analyses did not take in to account the possibility of low adherence (i.e. masks being worn for a low
percentage of exposure events) and/or the possibility of a very low probability of infection even without a mask.
When we consider such factors, none of the studies we analyze that did not find masks to be effective had sufficient
statistical power.
The sample of studies we consider is taken from a recent systematic review [18]; see table II for a list of studies
that were excluded and why. Most of the studies we examine measure whether surgical masks protect the wearer;

FIG. 2. Left: A susceptible individual’s probability of infection as a function of effective adherence αγ (mask effectiveness γ
multiplied by the fraction of exposures for which the mask is worn α) for various values of that individual’s total effective exposure ṽT (the total effective exposure is proportional to the number of exposure events). Note that if a mask were 100% effective
(γ = 1), then the effective adherence would simply equal the adherence α. The curves denoting the infection probabilities are
given by 1 − e−(1−αγ)ṽT (eq. (5)). For high values of ṽT , the infection probability is nonlinear in the adherence, while for low
values of ṽT , the infection probability decreases approximately linearly with adherence. Right: For a group of individuals (e.g.
in an arm of a study), the total effective exposure will in general vary from individual to individual such that even if on average
the total effective exposure is relatively low, it may be high for the individuals who make up the bulk of those being infected.
Thus, while using the average effective exposure would predict an approximately linear decrease of infection probability with
increasing adherence, such an approach may overestimate the expected effect of partial mask usage. The dashed curve depicts
the expected percentage of infected individuals for the homogeneous case in which everyone experiences the same total effective
exposure, whereas the solid curve depicts a case in which the exposure is heterogeneous; in both cases, the percentages of
individuals that would be infected without masks (e.g. in a control group) are identical (approximately 10%).

the exceptions are studies nos. 8, 12 and 15, which measure whether masks prevent the wearer from infecting others,
and studies nos. 1, 7, 13, and 18, in which both the susceptible and infected individuals sometimes wore masks (see
table I).
In order to account for adherence, we make two conservative assumptions that will result in our overestimating the
studies’ statistical powers. First, we assume that the degree to which a mask reduces the probability of infection is
proportional to the fraction of exposures for which it is worn (e.g. we assume wearing a mask half as often provides
half as much protection); in fact, wearing a mask half as often will reduce the probability of infection by less than
half as much (see fig. 2), meaning that we overestimate the statistical power of these studies. Second, the numbers
we calculate represent the power the studies would have had were masks 100% effective (i.e. were it impossible to
become infected while wearing a mask). To the extent that masks are less than 100% effective, even larger sample
sizes would be needed.
For example, a randomized control trial (RCT) at the Hajj pilgrimage [24] assumed a reduction in infection rate
from 12% to 6% in order to determine the sample size necessary for a statistical power of 80%. After taking into
account that the randomization was done by cluster (i.e. tent) rather than individual, the required sample size was
∼ 6000. However, the study reports that individuals in the intervention group on average wore masks for far less than
half the time. Under these conditions, even with perfectly effective masks, a 50% reduction in infection probability
is impossible. Adherence can be estimated by the product of the fraction of people who wore masks and the fraction
of time during which exposure is possible for which masks were used. The data reported in the study indicate an
adherence in the mask group of 3.2%, which could cause at most a 3.2% reduction in the probability of infection.
However, the adherence in the control group was 1.8%, meaning that the maximum possible expected reduction in
= 0.014 (eq. (10)). Thus the effective adherence value used for
infection between the two groups would be 0.032−0.018
1−0.018
this study is 0.014. In addition, the probability of infection without masks is reported to be quite low (2%). Under
these conditions, the required sample size to achieve the desired statistical power of 80% would be ∼ 7.8 million
(with individual randomization; with cluster randomization an even larger number of participants is needed). Power
analyses for other studies and the methods used are described in the appendix and summarized in figs. 1 and 5
and table I.
Other factors such as false positives may also limit statistical power. For instance, a recent study [25] conducted in
Denmark reported that a mask recommendation did not have a statistically significant effect: in the study’s primary
composite outcome, 42 vs. 53 people tested positive in the intervention and control groups, respectively. However, the
vast majority of these positive results were from antibody tests, and given the antibody test’s comparable incidence

convex for sufficiently small v. The convexity of f (v) (which is demonstrated in the Appendix) yields an S-curve for p(v). Note
that for any particular viral dose v, the effective exposure ṽ = f (v) can vary from individual to individual. Right: A depiction

and false positive rates (approximately 2% and 0.8%, respectively), a substantial fraction of the positive antibody
tests in both the control and intervention groups are likely to be false positives, which would affect both the study’s
power and its statistical analyses [26]. Further false positives could arise from individuals who were infected before
the study but for whom seroconversion did not occur until partway through the study. However, false positives were
not accounted for in the study’s statistical analysis or conclusions. If only the more reliable PCR tests are considered,
then the reduction in infection due to masks (0 vs. 5 infections) is statistically significant (p < 0.05).

NONLINEAR EFFECTS

We now describe a framework to account for the nonlinear aspects of mask effectiveness. Given that there is a
threshold for the viral dose (the amount of the virus inhaled) below which the probability of infection is very small due
to the innate immune system [27, 28], and given that the probability of infection p will converge to one (for susceptible
individuals) as the viral dose v is increased without limit, the probability of infection as a function of viral dose p(v)
is described by a sigmoid function or S-curve (fig. 3, see Appendix for details). (Concave curves have also been used
to model dose response curves, but such an approach ignores threshold effects [29, 30].) For a single exposure event,
we can define the dimensionless effective exposure ṽ ≡ − ln(1 − p(v)) such that the probability of infection is 1 − e−ṽ .
Conveniently, the effective exposure is additive for independent exposure events, i.e. the total probability of infection
is given by 1 − e−ṽT where the total effective exposure ṽT is simply equal to the sum of the effective exposures for
each exposure event.
Because the probability of infection is a concave function of the total effective exposure (fig. 3), the protection
afforded by a mask is super-linear in the percentage of exposures for which it is worn (e.g. wearing a mask twice
as often is more than twice as effective; see fig. 2). These nonlinear effects can be substantial for high cumulative
exposures. Under such conditions, a mask may need to be worn for most or nearly all of the exposure events in
order to provide significant protection; otherwise the individual is likely to be infected during the exposures for which
the mask is not worn. In the limit of an extremely high total exposure, a mask will of course not have an effect on
the probability of infection since a susceptible individual will be infected with nearly 100% probability regardless of
whether or not the mask is worn.
On the other hand, for low total exposures, the protection masks provide will be approximately proportional to
the fraction of exposures for which they are worn. It should be noted that the total exposure of individuals can
vary within any given study, such that even if the overall probability of infection is low, most of those who were
infected may have been subjected to high cumulative exposures. Studies with low overall probabilities of infection
also have an additional difficulty, which is that large sample sizes will be necessary in order that there may be enough
infections in the non-mask group to produce a statistically meaningful comparison. In other words, for sufficiently
low total exposure, the probability of infection will be quite low even without a mask, and so further reductions to
this probability, even if proportionally large, will be small in absolute terms.
We can also analyze certain compound effects that are not considered in most empirical studies. For instance,

FIG. 4. The effect of both the susceptible and infected individual wearing a mask can be much larger than the effect of only
one of them wearing a mask. In the depicted example, the total effective exposure ṽ0 if neither the infected nor susceptible
individual are wearing masks is such that the probability of infection pinf (ṽ0 ) is very close to 1. If each mask reduces the
effective exposure by a factor of 4, then the probability of infection if only one of the two individuals is wearing a mask is
pinf (ṽ0 /4) = 0.92, i.e. a reduction in risk by a factor of 1.08. If both individuals are wearing a mask, however, the probability of
infection is pinf (ṽ0 /16) = 0.46, corresponding to a reduction in risk by a factor of 2.17, which is greater than the product of the
effects of each mask individually (shown by the red dotted curve). For illustrative purposes we have assumed that the infectious
individual wearing a mask has the same effect as the susceptible individual wearing a mask, but relaxing this assumption will
not qualitatively change the results; see Appendix for details.

masks worn on both the infected and susceptible individuals may prevent a transmission event even if neither mask
individually would have. Furthermore, this compound effect may be super-linear: if the effect of only an infected
individual wearing a mask is to reduce the infection probability by a factor of p1 and the effect of only a susceptible
individual wearing a mask is to reduce the infection probability by a factor of p2 , both individuals wearing a mask
could reduce the infection probability by far greater than a factor of p1 p2 , especially for large total effective exposures.
In the example shown in fig. 4, the probability of transmission is reduced by only a factor of 1.08 (a 7% reduction)
due to one or the other individuals wearing a mask, while if both wear a mask, the probability of transmission will
be reduced by a factor of 2.17 (a 54% reduction). Similarly, just as there can be a super-linear compound effect from
both individuals wearing masks, there can also be super-linear compound effects when mask-wearing is combined
with other behaviors that reduce exposure, such as social distancing. Nonlinear effects continue to accumulate when
multiple individuals perform multiple behavioral changes that reduce exposure. Recognizing these nonlinear effects is
key to appreciating the effectiveness of transmission prevention policies.
It should also be noted that the proportional risk reduction from masks is expected to be large because—due to the
convexity of the S-curve (fig. 3) when exposure is low (as is likely for many exposure events)—the probability of the
mask-wearer being infected is decreased by a greater factor than the decrease in the viral dose [31] (see Appendix).
For these low exposure events, although the probability of infection may be small for any given potential transmission
event, given multiple events, the large factors by which the probabilities of infection decrease due to this convexity
can significantly reduce both the spread of the virus and the probability that the wearer eventually is infected. In
other words, wearing a mask may not only prevent the wearer from spreading viruses to others but may also have a
surprisingly large protective effect for the mask-wearer. Indeed, studies that analyze population-level data show that
masks significantly reduce transmission [17, 32–35].
In addition to the probability of infection, the implications of a nonlinear dose-response curve apply to several other
outcomes as well. In all of the above analyses, the probability of infection can be replaced with the probability of
death or the probability of a particular degree of severity of symptoms, each of which can have a unique S-curve (that
can also vary from individual to individual). Thus, even when a mask does not prevent infection, it may reduce the
severity of symptoms and the chance of long-term health damage or death. It has been observed for the influenza
virus that increasing the viral dose may lead to more adverse symptoms [36–38], an effect that may also apply to
SARS-CoV-2 [38–42].

CONCLUSIONS

Masks block some fraction of viral particles from dispersing from those who are infected and from infecting those
who are susceptible and are understood to prevent disease transmission through this mechanism. However, this simple
understanding has been questioned based upon mixed empirical evidence. Here we have shown that studies that did
not find masks to be effective had limited statistical power and therefore do not imply that masks are ineffective. The
empirical evidence as a whole is thus consistent with current epidemiological recommendations to use masks during
the COVID-19 pandemic.
We note that psycho-social effects can reinforce the effect of prevention. The more individuals who wear masks,
the less stigma that is associated with wearing them, which may make it more likely for others—including those who
are infectious (whether symptomatic, pre-symptomatic, or asymptomatic)—to wear masks. Masks may also serve as
a reminder to take precautions that compound super-linearly with mask-wearing such as social distancing, although
risk compensation, in which mask-wearing provides a sense of security that leads to higher risk taking, is also possible.
Effective public communication should emphasize that masks should be used in addition to and not as a substitute
for other precautionary measures.
We have also shown that for many exposure events, masks will reduce the probability of infection by a greater factor
than the factor by which they filter viral particles. This effect is also compounded non-linearly when both infected and
susceptible individuals wear masks. When interpreted in light of this a priori reasoning and the other considerations
discussed above, the evidence indicates that, in addition to preventing the wearer from spreading respiratory infections,
masks also protect the wearer from contracting them. The studies that did not find statistically significant effects
prove only that masks cannot offer protection if they are not worn.

Accounting for non-linearities in the effectiveness of masks

In this section we develop a framework with which to understand the effect of masks. We show that even if masks
were to reduce the viral dose by only a modest factor, they may have a significantly larger impact on the probability
of infection. We demonstrate that wearing a mask more frequently can super-linearly reduce one’s chance of infection
(e.g. wearing a mask 80% of the time reduces one’s probability of infection by more than twice as much as wearing
a mask 40% of the time). We also show that when both infected and susceptible individuals wear masks, there can
be a super-linear compound effect (e.g. if only infected individuals wearing masks reduces the probability of infecting
susceptible individuals by a factor of 3 and only susceptible individuals wearing masks reduces the probability of
being infected by a factor of 2, then if both wear masks the probability of infection will be reduced by a factor that
is greater than 2 × 3 = 6).

a.

General Framework

Although there is insufficient data to precisely describe the probability of infection as a function of the viral dose
inhaled in a single exposure event, we can nonetheless derive some constraints on its shape. For a susceptible individual,
the probability of infection (or any other outcome such as hospitalization or death) p is a function of the viral dose v,
i.e. the quantity of virus to which the individual is exposed. (This function p(v) will vary from individual to individual
based on biological factors, but should retain the general properties described below.) For small v the probability of
a susceptible individual becoming infected will approach zero, and for large v this probability will approach one, so
p(0) = 0 and p(∞) = 1. Since receiving two viral doses at once should not result in a lower probability of infection
than the hypothetical in which the exposure to each viral dose could be modeled as an independent event, we have
that
p(v1 + v2 ) ≥ p(v1 ) + p(v2 ) − p(v1 )p(v2 )

(1)

7
Equality will hold only in the absence of threshold effects; given that such effects are well established, we expect the
inequality to be strict for small v1 and v2 . In order to characterize the set of functions satisfying eq. (1), we transform
p(v) using p(v) ≡ 1 − e−f (v) , or equivalently, f (v) ≡ − ln(1 − p(v)). Eq. 1 is then equivalent to
f (v1 + v2 ) ≥ f (v1 ) + f (v2 )

(2)

Thus eq. (1) is equivalent to f (v) being convex. Choosing a convex f (v) and then transforming back to p(v) yields
an S-curve (fig. 3), also known as a sigmoid function or sigmoid curve.
When f (v)  1, it can be shown by Taylor expansion that p(v) ≈ f (v). Thus, for small viral doses, p(v) will be
convex as well. If a mask reduces the viral dose v by a factor b [6, 7], then the mask will reduce the probability of
infection (or of some other outcome denoted by p(v) such as the probability of severe infection or death) by a factor
p(v)
of p(v/b)
, which depends on v. When p(v) is convex, the factor by which the mask reduces the probability of infection
will be greater than b (since convexity implies that p(v/b) < 1b p(v) + (1 − 1b )p(0) = 1b p(v)). Thus, for small exposures,
masks can result in a surprisingly large reduction in the probability of infection. We treat the impact of masks in
more generality below, after introducing a framework for considering multiple exposure events.
The S-curve describes the probability of infection for a single exposure event. For N independent exposure events,
QN
the probability of getting infected is pinf = 1 − i=1 (1 − p(vi )). Using the form p(v) = 1 − e−f (v) as discussed above,
pinf = 1 − e−

where ṽT = i ṽi is the total effective exposure. Considering the effective exposure ṽ rather than the actual dose
v is convenient since the effective exposure for repeated independent exposures is simply the sum of the individual
effective exposures. Note that for small effective exposures, the probability of being infected is approximately equal
to the effective exposure, i.e. p̃(ṽ) ≈ ṽ for ṽ << 1.

b.

One mask

Let γ be the typical amount by which a mask reduces the effective exposure from a single exposure event—i.e.
ṽ → (1 − γ)ṽ.
Since f (0) = 0 and f (v) is convex, the simplest possible expression for f (v) is the scale-free form f (v) = (v/v0 )β ,
for some v0 > 0 and β > 1. In this case, if a mask reduces the viral dose v to v/b, γ can be calculated exactly as
γ = 1 − b−β , regardless of v. For small exposures, the infection probability is roughly equal to the effective exposure,
1
> b) due to convexity (β > 1), consistent with the analysis
which is reduced by a factor greater than b (i.e. 1−γ
above. This effect could potentially be quite large: e.g. for β = 4, a mask filtering half of the viral particles (b = 2)
corresponds to a sixteen-fold reduction in effective exposure (γ ≈ 0.94). If we relax this assumption on the function
f , then γ becomes an effective parameter that may depend on the distribution of viral doses to which an individual
1
is exposed. Regardless of the precise form of f (v), however, 1−γ
> b will always hold due to the convexity of f (v),
i.e. masks will always have a disproportionately large effect on the effective exposure (and thus also on the infection
probability when the effective exposure is small).
Then, if a mask is worn for a fraction α of all exposures, the total effective exposure will be reduced from ṽT to
(1 − αγ)ṽT . The probability of infection is thus
p̃((1 − αγ)ṽT ) = 1 − e−(1−αγ)ṽT

(5)

(see fig. 2).
Thus, we see that for any fixed γ (mask effectiveness) and ṽT (total effective exposure without a mask), the benefit
of wearing a mask is a convex function of the fraction α of the exposure events for which it is worn. In other words,
wearing a mask x times as often will reduce the infection probability by more than a factor of x. Thus, even if masks
were 100% effective (γ = 1), a study in which participants wear masks 10% of the time would need to have sufficient
power to detect less than a 10% reduction in the probability of infection. Our analysis therefore overestimates the
true power of the studies.

8
c.

Two masks

To the extent that two masks together have an approximately linear effect on the effective exposure (e.g. if one
person wearing a mask reduces effective exposure by 1 − γ1 and the second person wearing a mask reduces effective
exposure by 1 − γ2 , then both wearing masks reduces effective exposure by 1 − γ12 ≈ (1 − γ1 )(1 − γ2 )), the effect on
the probability of transmission will be super-linear, since the probability of infection p̃(ṽ) is concave in the effective
exposure ṽ. In other words, especially for individuals who would have received a large total effective exposure without
masks, both the susceptible and infectious individuals wearing masks will have a larger effect than would be calculated
if each mask had an independent effect on the probability of transmission.
If the effect of the two masks on the effective exposure is super-linear (i.e. 1 − γ12 < (1 − γ1 )(1 − γ2 )), then the effect
on the probability of transmission will be super-linear to an even greater extent. If the effect of the two masks on the
effective exposure is sub-linear (i.e. 1 − γ12 > (1 − γ1 )(1 − γ2 )), then whether or not they still have a super-linear
effect on the probability of transmission will depend on the total effective exposure.
(Note: Under the simplest possible form for ṽ = f (v), i.e. f (v) = (v/v0 )β , if the mask on the infected individual
reduces v by a factor of b1 , the mask on the susceptible individual reduces v by a factor of b2 , and together the masks
reduce v by a factor of b1 b2 , then the masks will have a linear effect on effective exposure, i.e. 1−γ12 = (1−γ1 )(1−γ2 ).
Under other forms for f (v) or assumptions about how the masks affect v, other behavior is possible.)

Power analyses

Let p1 and p2 be the probabilities of getting infected in the non-mask (size N1 ) and mask group (size N2 ), respectively. Defining  = p1 − p2 , the null hypothesis is H0 :  = 0 and the alternate hypothesis is H1 :  6= 0. A test
statistic is
pˆ1 − pˆ2
p̂1 − p̂2
W =p
=
ŝ
p̂1 (1 − p̂1 )/N1 + p̂2 (1 − p̂2 )/N2

(6)

where p̂1 and p̂2 refer to the observed fraction of infections, assumed to be normally distributed random variables
whose means are p1 and p2 (this approximation is asymptotically exact). We use the shorthand ŝ for the denominator
of W ; note that ŝ is an estimator for s, where s2 = p1 (1 − p1 )/N1 + p2 (1 − p2 )/N2 is the sum of the asymptotic
variances of p̂1 and p̂2 . Asymptotically, W − /s follows a standard normal distribution. Using the standard notation
Φ(z1−α/2 ) = 1 − α/2 where Φ(x) is the standard normal cumulative distribution function, the rejection region under
H0 for a significance level of α is given by the union of
W < −z1−α/2 and W > z1−α/2

(7)

The various studies may use slightly different statistical tests, but the differences between tests should be small and will
asymptotically disappear entirely. For any particular values of  and s, the probability W < −z1−α/2 is asymptotically
given by Φ(−z1−α/2 − /s) and the probability W > z1−α/2 is asymptotically given by 1 − Φ(z1−α/2 − /s) =
Φ(−z1−α/2 + /s). Thus, given  and s, the power, denoted by 1 − β and equal to the probability that the null
hypothesis is rejected if it is indeed false, is asymptotically given by
1 − β = Φ(−z1−α/2 − /s) + Φ(−z1−α/2 + /s)

(8)

Under the assumptions that masks are fully effective (γ = 1) and that the probability of infection pinf decreases
linearly with the adherence, the effect of mask usage is
pinf → pinf (1 − a)

(9)

where the adherence a is the average fraction of exposure events for which the masks were used (see section 1 of the
Appendix; here we use a instead of α for the adherence to avoid confusion with the significance level). Thus, for an
infection probability pinf = p1 in the non-mask group (size N1 ), the infection probability in the mask group (size N2 )
will be p2 = p1 (1 − a). Thus, by estimating p1 and a for each study, we can use eq. (8) to find power of each study
given the sizes of their non-mask and mask groups, as well as the sample size (i.e. total number of participants) that
would have been required for 80% power. For the latter estimate, we assume a study design in which the participants
are evenly divided between the non-mask and mask groups (i.e. N1 + N2 = 2N1 = 2N2 ) and rounded up the necessary
sample size to the nearest even integer.

FIG. 5. Summary of statistical power analysis. Given the adherence levels reported in the studies the sample size necessary for
a statistical power of 80% for a two-tailed test and significance level of 0.05 (assuming participants are equally divided between
the non-mask and mask groups) is presented in column XI. The statistical power given the actual sizes of the non-mask and
mask groups is presented in column X. These calculations were made for the case in which masks are 100% effective; if masks
are effective but not perfectly so, the necessary sample sizes for 80% power (column XI) will be larger, while the statistical
powers given the actual sample sizes (column X) will be lower. Studies found to have greater than 80% power are in bold
(nos. 15-23), and studies that found a statistically significant reduction in infections in the mask group are italicized (nos. 4,
14-23). Adherence is defined as the fraction of exposure for which masks were used; calculations of adherence for each study are
presented in table I. For studies that reported multiple analyses, each analysis is listed as its own entry (e.g. Aiello (2012) [43]
performed one analysis in which infection is defined by influenza-like illness (no. 10) and one analysis in which infection is
defined by a positive PCR test result (no. 11)). Note that only in the intention-to-treat analyses are participants randomly
divided between the non-mask and mask groups; in survey and per-protocol analyses, which group a participant belongs to
depends on whether or not that individual reported wearing a mask with a frequency above a threshold decided by the study.

For certain studies, some participants in the non-mask group used masks as well. In this case, adherence in both the
mask group and non-mask group must be considered. Under the assumption that probability of infection decreases
linearly with effective adherence, the probability of infection in the non-mask group p1 is related to the probability
of infection without masks p0 by p1 = p0 (1 − γa1 ) where a1 is the adherence in the non-mask group and γ is mask
effectiveness. Then the probability of infection in the mask group will be p2 = p0 (1 − γa2 ) where a2 is the adherence
a2 −a1
. In our analyses we

assume γ = 1, which leads to an overestimate for the net adherence a of

(10)

We estimate p1 using the observed fraction of infections in the non-mask group p̂1 . To check the robustness of
our conclusions, we did a sensitivity
analysis and found that if p̂1 differs from p1 by a standard deviation (i.e. if we
q
1
4N1 ),

all studies that were under-powered (< 80%), except for one [43] remain underq
1
powered. (To ensure robustness we used 4N
as the standard deviation, which is the maximum possible value of
1
p
the true standard deviation p1 (1 − p1 )/N1 .) If p̂1 underestimates p1 by two standard deviations, another study [44]
would have greater than 80% power under our assumptions. It should be noted, however, that these assumptions
overestimate the power in multiple ways (fully effective masks, overestimated adherence values, assuming a linear
relationship between adherence and effectiveness, and the fact that individuals whose infections were not detected
until after the start of the study could have actually been infected before they start of the study, i.e. before the mask
intervention was implemented).
A more significant limitation of our analysis is in the difficulty in estimating adherence. Adherence is often reported
qualitatively, and even when quantitative, it is reported as the amount of time for which one wears a mask, which
may differ from the fraction of exposures for which masks were worn. To account for this difficulty, our strategy has
been to consistently overestimate statistical power; to this end, we have erred on the side of overestimating adherence
(see table I), and have also used other overestimating assumptions described in the previous paragraph.

tients and their adherence, we assume no transmission occurs while either the index patient or contact is wearing a mask.
contacts
Neglecting correlations between whether or not the index patient wore a mask and the number of contacts
of that index patient, an upper bound for the probability that either a contact or the index patient corresponding to that contact used a mask is 45%+21% = 66% (this is likely an overestimate since households
in which index patients wear masks and households in which contacts wear masks are almost certainly not
mutually exclusive). In the control group, 30 % of index patients and 1 % of contacts used masks. Those
classified as using masks used them often or always; therefore we assume that they used masks for 80%
of all exposures, a likely overestimate since the participants were asked to use masks only when they are
not sleeping or eating. Therefore, the adherence in the mask group is estimated as 0.66 × 0.8 = 0.53, and
adherence in the control group is estimated as 0.31 × 0.8 = 0.25. This leads to a net adherence of 0.37
according to eq. (10).

sleeping, even if the child (index patient) was next to them in bed, and because the contacts could have
been infected even if they were not in the same room as the index patient. The adherence is estimated as
0.45 × 0.8 = 0.36

Hajj study: From figure 2 of the study, we can only obtain approximate numbers since numerical data is
not available in the figure. An average across the four days gives us the percentage of people using masks
for various amounts of time. Using the upper bounds of the reported time ranges, we compute the average
mask usage duration. For the last time range (greater than 3 hours), we assume that masks were used on
average for 5 hours. This leads to an average mask use of 0.778 hours and an adherence in the mask group
of 0.778/24 = 0.032. Participants in the control group used masks for 0.438 hours on average, yielding an
adherence in the control group of 0.438/24 = 0.018. The net adherence value is thus 0.014 (eq. (10)). Note
that the systematic review [18] uses an older pre-print version of this study.

tients and their (and not mean) mask usage was reported for the index and contact individuals; we therefore approximate
contacts
the mean with the median. The median mask usage for the index patient was 35 minutes. The mean of
median mask usage for contacts—parents, siblings and other relations—was 107.9 minutes. We estimate
that index patients and contacts were in contact for 10.4 hours per day using data from a similar study [47]
(row no. 12). Adherence is therefore estimated as 107.9+35
60×10.4 = 0.23 (see row no. 1 for why the index and
contact mask usages were added together), a likely overestimate, given that the majority of the households
resided in small one-bedroom apartments and thus were likely in contact for significantly greater than 10.4
hours per day on average. Furthermore, contacts could have been infected outside of their homes. Also, it
was reported that 17.6% of individuals in the control group used masks, meaning it was likely that those
in the hand-hygiene-only group did as well (which would further reduce the net adherence).

Visitors had to use face masks when they visited patients in their rooms and the incidence of infections
was recorded among the patients. Although adherence was not reported, it is reasonable to assume that
adherence was high since the study was conducted in a hospital where doctors and health care workers
would have ensured that protocols are followed; in addition the visitors were in contact with patients only
for a limited duration. We therefore assume an adherence of 0.8

Emamian [65] 2013 Survey study for Hajj pilgrims: Adherence for mask usage was reported only as ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. Even
occasional use of mask was considered as ‘Yes’. Since adherence data stratified by frequency and/or
duration was not reported, we could not make an estimate for the adherence.
Deris [66]

2010 Survey study for Hajj pilgrims: Adherence for mask usage was reported only as ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. Since
adherence data stratified by frequency and/or duration was not reported, we could not make an estimate
for the adherence.

Uchida [67]

2017 Survey study for children. Mask usage was reported as ‘using masks at any time or place’. Since adherence
data stratified by frequency and/or duration was not reported, we could not make an estimate for the
adherence.

Balaban [68]

2012 Survey study for Hajj pilgrims: Adherence for mask usage was reported only as ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. Since
adherence data stratified by frequency and/or duration was not reported, we could not make an estimate
for the adherence.
