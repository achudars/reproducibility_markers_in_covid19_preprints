We predict and analyze the drying time of respiratory droplets from a COVID-19 infected subject, which is a crucial
time to infect another subject. The drying of the droplet is predicted by diffusion-limited evaporation model for a sessile
droplet placed on a partially-wetted surface with a pinned contact line. The variation of droplet volume, contact angle,
ambient temperature, and humidity are considered. We analyze the chances of the survival of the viruses present in the
droplet, based on the lifetime of the droplets in several conditions, and find that the chances of survival of the virus
are strongly affected by each of these parameters. The magnitude of shear stress inside the droplet computed using the
model is not large enough to obliterate the virus. We also explore the relationship between the drying time of a droplet
and the growth rate of the spread of COVID-19 for five different cities, and find that they are weakly correlated.
Studies have reported that infectious diseases such as influenza spread through respiratory droplets. The respiratory
droplets could transmit the virus from one subject to another
through the air. These droplets can be produced by sneezing
and coughing. Han et al.1 measured the size distribution of
sneeze droplets exhaled from the mouth. They reported that
the geometric mean of the droplet size of 44 sneezes of 20
healthy subjects is around 360 µm for unimodal distribution
and is 74 µm for bimodal distribution. Liu et al.2 reported
around 20% longer drying time of saliva droplets as compared to water droplets, deposited on a Teflon-printed slide.
They also predicted and compared these times with a model
and considered solute effect (Raoult’s effect), due to the presence of salt/electrolytes in saliva. The slower evaporation in
the saliva droplet is attributed to the presence of the solute in
it2 . Xie et al.3 developed a model for estimating the droplet
diameter, temperature, and falling distance as a function of
time, as droplets are expelled during various respiratory activities. They reported that large droplets expelled horizontally can travel a long distance before hitting the ground. In
a recent study, Bourouiba4 provided evidence for droplets expelled during sneezing being carried to a much larger distance
(of 7-8 m) than previously thought. The warm and moist air
surrounding the droplets helps in carrying the droplets to such
a large distance.
While the role of virus-laden droplets in spreading infectious diseases is well-known, the drying time of such droplets
after falling upon a surface has not been well-studied. In this
context, Buckland and Tyrrell5 experimentally studied the loss
in infectivity of different viruses upon drying of virus-laden
droplets on a glass slide. At room temperature and 20% relative humidity, the mean log reduction in titre was reported
to be in the range of 0.5-3.7 for the 19 viruses considered
by them. The need for studying the evaporation dynamics of
virus-laden droplets has also been recognized in the recent article by Mittal et al.6 . Further, to reduce the transmission of
COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, the use

of a face mask has been recommended by WHO7 . The infected droplets could be found on a face mask or a surface
inside the room, which necessitates the regular cleaning of
the surfaces exposed to droplets. Therefore, the present study
examines the drying times of such droplets which correlates
with the time in which the chances of the transmissibility of
the virus are high5,8 .
First, we present the different components of the model,
used to estimate the drying time and shear stress. We consider aqueous respiratory droplets that are on the order of 1
nL to 10 nL, on a solid surface. The range of the volume is
consistent with previous measurements1 . The corresponding
diameters of the droplets in the air are around 125 µm and
270 µm and probability density function (PDF) of the normal
distribution of the droplet diameter in the air is plotted in Fig.
1. The mean diameter and standard deviation are 188 µm and
42 µm, respectively. Droplets smaller than 100 µm are not
considered in this study because such droplets are expected to
remain airborne, while the larger droplets being heavier settle
down9 . The droplet is assumed to be deposited as a spherical cap on the substrate. Since the wetted diameter of the
droplet is lesser than capillary length (2.7 mm for water), the
droplet maintains a spherical cap shape throughout the evap-

maximum value of th /tF is estimated to be around 0.05 at
40◦ C, the maximum water droplet temperature considered in
the present work and contact angle of 90◦ (h/R = 1). The values of D, α and ρ are taken as 2.5 × 10−5 m2 /s, 1.45 × 10−7

that an evaporating water droplet in ambient does not exhibit
Marangoni stresses13,16,17 , therefore, we estimate U using the

where V0 and ρ are the initial volume and density of the
droplet. The properties of pure water have been employed
in the present calculations to determine the drying time and
shear stress. Since the thermo-physical properties of saliva
are not very different from water, the present results provide a
good estimate of the evaporation time under different scenarios and shear stress. Further, we obtain the expression of the
maximum shear stress (τ) on 125 nm diameter SARS-CoV-2
virus, suspended in the sessile water droplet and estimate its
range for the droplet size considered. The shear stress on the
virus would be maximum for a virus adhered to the substrate

compared the value of Jmax for a 3.7 nL evaporating water

verifying the present calculations. The computed range of the
shear stress is [0.056-0.026] Pa for [1-10] nL droplets.
Second, we present the effect of ambient temperature, surface wettability, and relative humidity on the drying time of
the droplet. In this context, we examine the drying time of a
deposited droplet in two different ambient temperatures, 25o C
and 40o C. The chosen temperatures are representative of temperatures inside a room with air-conditioning and outdoors
in summer. Fig. 3 shows the variation of evaporation time
with droplet volume, at the two different ambient temperatures considered. The contact angle and humidity for these
simulations are taken as 30o and 50%, respectively. At 25 o C,
the evaporation time for small droplets is about 6 s, which increases to 27 s for large size droplets. The evaporation time
increases as the square of the droplet radius, or 2/3 power
of volume. An increase in ambient temperature reduces the
evaporation time substantially (by about 50% for 15 o C rise in
temperature). Therefore, an increase in the ambient temperature is expected to drastically reduce the chance of infection
through contact with an infected droplet.
The effect of the surface on which the droplet can fall onto
is modeled here through an appropriate value of the contact
angle. The contact angle of 10o corresponds to a water droplet
on glass, while 90o corresponds to a water droplet on the touch
screen of a smartphone (Table I). The results of the simula-

3
tions corresponding to these two contact angles are plotted in
Fig. 3. The ambient temperature and humidity are taken as
25◦C and 50%, respectively. Fig. 3 shows that the effect of
the surface can be quite profound; the evaporation time can
increase by 60% for a more hydrophobic surface. With a decrease in contact angle, the droplet spreads into a thin film,
which has a relatively large mass loss rate from the droplet
to the ambient. Therefore, for a surface with a smaller contact angle, the evaporation time of the droplet is smaller. The
effect of the surface can further manifest by a difference in
temperature in different parts of the surface. Such inhomogeneity in surface temperature can be brought about by the
difference in the surface material (leading to the difference in
the emissivity) or differential cooling (for example, due to the
corner effect). Even a slight difference in the surface temperature can further aggravate the surface effect by influencing the
evaporation time.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus has a lipid envelop, and in general,
the survival tendency of such viruses, when suspended in air,
is larger at a lower relative humidity of 20–30%23 , as compared to several other viruses which do not have a protective
lipid layer. Here, we examine the effect of the relative humidity on the survival of the virus inside a droplet, deposited on
a surface. Fig. 3 shows that the relative humidity has a strong
effect on the evaporation time. The contact angle and ambient
temperature for these calculations are taken as 30o and 25o C,
respectively. The evaporation time of a droplet increases almost 7-fold with an increase in humidity from 10% to 90%.
Further, the evaporation time becomes greater than 2 min for
large droplets at high humidity. With the increase in humidity
in coastal areas in summer and later in other parts of Asia in
July-September with advent of Monsoon, this may become an
issue, as there will be sufficient time for the virus to spread
from the droplet to new hosts, upon contact with the infected
droplet. Therefore, a larger humidity increases the survival of
the virus when it is inside the droplet, however, it decreases
its chances of the survival if the virus is airborne.
Finally, we discuss the relevance of the present results in
the context of COVID-19 pandemic. The evaporation time of
a droplet is a critical parameter as it determines the duration
over which spread of infection from the droplet to another person coming in contact with the droplet, is possible. The virus
needs a medium to stay alive5 ; therefore, once the droplet has
evaporated, the virus is not expected to survive. The evaporation time can, therefore, be taken as an indicator of the
survival time of the virus. In general, it is regarded that a
temperature of 60 o C maintained for more than 60 min inactivates most viruses23 ; however, contrary reports about the effect of temperature on the survivability of SARS-CoV-2 virus
has been reported.24,25 Our results indicate that the survival
time of the virus depends on the surface on which the droplet
has fallen, along with the temperature and humidity of the ambient air. The present results are expected to be of relevance
in two different scenarios: When droplets are generated by
an infected person by coughing or sneezing (in the absence
of a protective mask), or when fine droplets are sprayed on a
surface for cleaning/disinfecting the surface. A wide range of
droplet sizes is expected to be produced in these cases. The

mutual interaction of the droplets, such that they interfere in
the evaporation dynamics, is however expected to be weak because of the large distance between the droplets as compared
to their diameter.
The virus inside a droplet is subjected to shear stresses,
due to the generation of evaporation-induced flow inside the
droplet. The magnitude of this shear stress has however been
estimated to be small and the virus is unlikely to be disrupted
by this shear stress inside the droplet.
To determine the likelihood of the droplet and the virus on
the surface, we find the mean and standard deviation of the
probability density function (PDF) of the normal distribution
of the droplet drying times for different cases of ambient temperature, contact angle and relative humidity. The values of
the mean and standard deviation are plotted using bar and error bar, respectively, in Fig. 4. The likelihood lifetime is in the
range for [5-20] s for H ≤ 50% while it is a range of [40-100]
s for H = 50%. This result shows that the drying time is likely
to be larger by around five times in case of large relative humidity values, thereby, increasing the chances of the survival
of the virus.
Further, we examine the connection between the drying
time of a droplet to the growth of the infection. A similar
approach was tested for suspended droplets in air in Ref.27
recently. We hypothesize that since the drying time of a respiratory droplet on a surface is linked to the survival of the
droplet, it is correlated with the growth of the pandemic. Since
the drying time is a function of weather, we compare the
growth of infection with the drying time for different cities.
The cities were selected based on cold/warm and dry/humid
weather. The growth of the total number of infections is plotted for cities with different weather during the pandemic in
Fig. 5. The data of the infections were obtained from public

repositories28,29 . The data were fitted with linear curves using
the least-squares method and the slope of the fits represents
the growth rate (number of infections per day) of the respective city. The growth rate of New York City and Singapore is
the largest and lowest, respectively.
For different cities, we compute the drying time of a droplet
of 5 nL volume, which is the mean volume obtained using
PDF of the distribution (Fig. 1). The ambient temperature and
relative humidity are taken as mean of the respective ranges,
listed in Table II. As discussed earlier, the drying time increases with increase in humidity, however, it decreases with
increase in ambient temperature. Thus, the combined effect of
humidity and temperature decides the final drying time. This
can be illustrated by comparing the drying time of Singapore
and New York city, plotted in Fig. 6. The time is shorter for the
former as compared to the latter, despite with a large humidity
for the former (70-80%) as compared to the latter (50-60%).
Lastly, Fig. 6 compares the growth rate and drying time of
the different cities using vertical bars and symbols, respectively. The growth rate appears to be weakly correlated with
the drying time i.e. a larger (lower) growth rate corresponds
to larger (lower) drying time. Qualitatively, this data verifies
that when a droplet evaporates slowly, the chance for survival
of the virus is enhanced and the growth rate is augmented.
We recognize that there are limitations of the model presented here, which can be improved in subsequent studies. In
particular, the ambient air has been assumed to be stationary;
the evaporation time is expected to reduce in presence of convective currents. Therefore, the value of the predicted evaporation times is on the conservative side and the actual evaporation time will be smaller than that obtained here. The effect
of the solute present (i.e., Raoult’s law) in saliva/mucus has
not been modeled and the contact angle and drying of these
biological fluids could be slightly different from that of pure
water on a solid surface. However, the impact of these latter
effects on the drying time is expected to be small. Further,
the model does not consider the interaction of the droplets.
It is likely that the respiratory droplets, expelled from mouth
and/or nose, deposit adjacent to each other on a surface and
could interact while evaporating30 . They may interact while
falling31 and a falling droplet may coalesce on an already deposited droplet on a surface32 . In addition, receding of the
contact line may influence the drying time33 , which is not considered in the present work.
In closure, we have examined the likelihood of survival of
the SARS-CoV-2 virus suspended in respiratory droplets originated from a COVID-19 infected subject. The droplet considered to be evaporating in a quiet ambient on different surfaces. The droplets volume range is considered as [1, 10] nL.
The datasets of drying time presented here for different ambient conditions and surfaces will be helpful in future studies.
The likelihood of the survival of the virus increases roughly
by 5 times in a humid ambient as compared to a dry ambient.
The growth rate of the COVID-19 was found to be weakly
correlated with the outdoor weather. While the present Letter
discusses the results in the context of COVID-19, the present
model is also valid for respiratory droplets of other transmissible diseases, such as Influenza A.
