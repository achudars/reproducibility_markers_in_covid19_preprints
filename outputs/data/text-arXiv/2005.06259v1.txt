MeSH descriptors indicate the knowledge growth in the
SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic.

Abstract

tests, drugs and vaccines in order to gain control over
the virus and the disease as quick as possible.
An important research tool is immediate and unlimited access to the scientific literature. For the
biomedical specialties, the freely available database
PUBMED/MEDLINE∗ is indispensable for a comprehensive retrieval of the published scientific papers
on biomedical research questions. Besides the bibliographic metadata (as author name(s), publication
year, journal name and volume, etc.) PUBMED
records are indexed by a controlled vocabulary of
many thousands descriptors, the Medical Subject
Headings (MeSH† ). In addition to the words contained in titles and abstracts of indexed papers, the
MeSH descriptors assigned to PUBMED records are
significant for a thorough analysis of the papers’ content.
In the study presented here the publications on
SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 were retrieved and
downloaded from PUBMED. The MeSH descriptors
were extracted from the records already annotated
with MeSH. The keywords were ordered chronologically according to the publication date of their associated papers and their first occurences were determined.

The scientific papers dealing with the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by this virus,
published in 2020 and recorded in the database
PUBMED, were retrieved on April 27, 2020. About
20% of the records contain Medical Subject Headings
(MeSH), keywords assigned to records in the course
of the indexing process in order to summarise the
articles’ contents. The temporal sequence of the first
occurrences of the keywords was determined, thus
giving insight into the growth of the knowledge base
of the pandemic.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, PUBMED,
Medical Subject Headings.

Introduction

The rapid worldwide spread of the new epidemic
COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, with
now more than 3.4 million confirmed cases of the disease and a confirmed death rate of almost 7% (World
Health Organization, 2020) requires fast and comprehensive efforts of states and societies to combat the
disease effectively by means of practical and appropriate medical, administrative and economic actions.
Moreover, the scientific community has the responsibility to bundle resources and manpower to develop

The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) assigned
to PUBMED records are contained in the MH fields.
Controlled vocabulary is also contained in the RN
fields. The contents of both fields were extracted
from the records. In addition, the unique record numbers and the database indexing date were extracted
from the PMID and MHDA fields, respectively.

Results and Discussion

The search profile mentioned in the Methods paragraph retrieved 7366 publications for the period January to April 27, 2020 (Table 1). The daily distribution of the items is shown in Figure 1. In January
and February 2020 few papers appeared, followed by

a considerable publication boost in March and April.
Similar data were published by Kousha and Thelwall
(2020) and Torres-Salinas (2020). About 20% of the
papers have already assigned MeSH terms (Table 1).
The daily distribution of papers with MeSH terms
(Figure 2) is more or less similar to that of all papers
(compare Figure 2 and Figure 1). Figure 3 shows
that the cumulation of MeSH terms parallels the cumulation of MeSH papers. Both, Figure 2 and Figure 3, indicate that the MeSH terms used to classify
SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 papers may exhibit to some
extent the knowledge accumulation and development
around the pandemic.

3.1

Conclusion

The short analysis of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19
publications presented here shows that careful inspection of the assigned Medical Subject Headings
is worthwhile and associated with an increase of the
knowledge base of the pandemic.

Tables 2 and 3 show the addition of (new) MeSH
terms to indexed papers by day. Table 2 shows the
numbers, Table 3 examples of the terms. Table 2
lists the dates and the number of publications with
MeSH indexed as well as the numbers of new MeSH
terms, i.e. MeSH terms which are not contained in
the papers of the preceding dates. In Table 3 selected Medical Subject Headings are listed according
to the sequence of their appearance from February to
April 2020. The MeSH terms assigned to papers in
the first half of February 2020 indicate the knowledge
of a disease outbreak in China of pandemic proportions, caused by a betacoronavirus, and both, disease
and virus, are already labelled (Table 3). The concomitant - possibly life-threatening - implications of
the new disease, disease-spreading mechanisms, necessary diagnostic tools, assessment of especially vulnerable age groups, problems of health care systems,
possible drug therapy schemes and other therapy approaches become evident using the information contained in MeSH terms assigned to papers published
in subsequent days, weeks and months. Although the
fraction of papers with assigned MeSH terms is relatively low (see Table 1), may the whole set of already
more than 1700 MeSH terms (at the download date,
see e.g. Table 2) greatly benefit (not only) medical
experts.
