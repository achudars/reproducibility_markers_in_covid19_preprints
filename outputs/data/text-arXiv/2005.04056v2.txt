Covid-19 has caused hundred of thousands of deaths and an economic damage amounting to
trillions of dollars, creating a desire for the rapid development of vaccine. Once available, vaccine
is gradually produced, evoking the question on how to distribute it best. While official vaccination
guidelines largely focus on the question to whom vaccines should be provided first (e.g. to risk
groups), here we propose a strategy for their distribution in time and space, which sequentially
prioritizes regions with a high local infection growth rate. To demonstrate this strategy, we develop
a simple statistical model describing the time-evolution of infection patterns and their response
to vaccination, for infectious diseases like Covid-19. For inhomogeneous infection patterns, locally
well-mixed populations and basic reproduction numbers R0 ∼ 1.5 − 4 the proposed strategy at least
halves the number of deaths in our simulations compared to the standard practice of distributing
vaccines proportionally to the population density. For R0 ∼ 1 we still find a significant increase
of the survival rate. The proposed vaccine distribution strategy can be further tested in detailed
modelling works and could excite discussions on the importance of the spatiotemporal distribution
of vaccines for official guidelines.

Introduction:
The Covid-19 pandemic 2019/2020 [1–5] has led to almost 10 million infections and 500.000 deaths worldwide
(June 2020) [6, 7] and an unprecedented social and economic cost which comprises a sudden rise of the number
of unemployments by more than 20 million in the USA
alone, and a damage of trillions of dollars at the stock
market and in the worldwide real economy. This situation challenges politicians to decide on suitable measures
and researchers to explore their efficiency, based on models allowing to forecast and compare the evolution of infectious diseases (like Covid-19) when taking one or the
other action.
Available measures to efficiently deal with epidemic
outbreaks at low infection numbers include a rigorous
contact-tracing (e.g. based on “Corona-Apps” [8]) and
-testing combined with quarantine of infected individuals [9–12]. Strict travel restrictions preventing an infectious disease from entering disease-free regions (or to die
out locally [13]) present an alternative measure [14, 15],
whereas travel reductions by less than ∼ 99% [16] slow
down the spreading of the disease only slightly [16–18].
At higher infection numbers reducing the contact rate
through measures broadly affecting a population’s everyday life, such as social distancing [10, 12, 19–22] and lockdown [12, 23], remains as the only possibility to avoid
an explosion of infection numbers. Unless a population
persistently reduces the contact rate to the point where
infection numbers decrease (this requires a contact reduction by > 60% for a basic reproduction number of

R0 = 2.5 [21]), at such stages it has to accept that the
majority of its members has to endure the disease – until
finally reaching herd immunity [24].
The main hope which remains at such stages rests on
the rapid discovery and admission of vaccine [25, 26]
(or antibodies [27]) to accelerate reaching herd immunity. However, while every day where an infectious disease like Covid-19 is active may cause thousands of additional deaths, even after admission, it may take months
until sufficient vaccine is available to overcome an infectious disease. Therefore it is important to strategically distribute the available vaccines such that the number of deaths remains as small as possible. Surprisingly,
both official vaccination guidelines, e.g. for pandemic
influenza [28, 29], and previous works on vaccine distribution [30–32], focus on the question to whom vaccine
should be mainly provided, e.g. to prioritize individuals
by age or disease risk, and leave the quest for a suitable
spatial and temporal vaccine distribution aside. (Other
works like [33] ask for the optimal vaccine production
rate.) This results in the common practice of simply distributing vaccines proportionally to the population density [34].
In the present work we propose an alternative strategy
for the spatiotemporal distribution of gradually produced
vaccines, which hinges on the idea that the number of
deaths due to a spreading infectious disease is controlled
by the pattern of local infection rates, not by population density. This strategy, which we call the ”focusing strategy“, sequentially prioritizes regions (cities) with
the highest growth rates of the local infection numbers
(see Fig. 1 and the supplementary movie) and provides,
or ”focuses“, all available vaccines to those regions. To
compare the focusing strategy with the “demographic”
vaccine distribution practice, we develop a simple statis-

tical model describing the time-evolution of an epidemic
outbreak (such as Covid-19) and its response to vaccination. As our central result, we find that the number of
deaths resulting from infections occurring after the onset
of vaccine production is generally smaller when following
the focusing strategy rather than the demographic distribution practice. In fact, for strongly inhomogeneous
infection patterns, the focusing strategy reduces the number of deaths by more than a factor of two, for a large
range of basic reproduction numbers R0 and vaccine production rates. The difference is largest for R0 ∼ 2 − 3, as
might be typical for Covid-19 if no additional measures
are in action, but even for R0 ∼ 1 the focusing strategy
significantly increases the survival probability.

I.

MODEL

To explore the impact of the spatiotemporal vaccine
distribution on the disease-evolution in detail, we now introduce a computational model, which is based on Brownian agents and allows deriving a (nonuniform) statistical
mean-field model as we will discuss below. Both models
are expected to apply to situations where the population
is locally well-mixed. The model describes the dynamics
of N agents moving randomly in continuous space in a
box of size L×L with periodic boundary conditions. The
agents represent groups of individuals and have an internal state variable, which is inspired by the SIR model
[35–37] and its variants [38–42]. We use colors (see legend in Fig. 1) to represent the possible states in our simulations, which refer to individuals which are “susceptible” (grey), “infected with weak symptoms” (orange),
“infected with significant symptoms” (red), “recovered”
(green) and “vaccinated” (blue). Infected agents (orange
and red) have an inner clock; they remain symptom free
for a latency time tL and then show mild (orange) or
significant (red) symptoms for a duration tD − tL . Af-

ter an overall disease duration of tD they either recover
with a survival probability so,r (green) or die with probability 1 − so,r (black), where the indices refer to agents
with mild (orange) and significant symptoms (red), respectively. To model the infection dynamics we describe
the spatial motion of an agent
√ with position ri (t) using
Brownian dynamics ṙi (t) = 2Dηi (t), where D is the
diffusion coefficient controlling how fast agents move and
ηi (t) represents Gaussian white noise with zero mean and
unit variance. We assume that all infected agents (orange
and red) are infectious, both in the latent phase and afterwards (as for Covid-19) and infect a fraction of βo +βr
of those susceptible agents (grey) which are closer than
a distance Rc ; here, indices refer to mild (orange) and
significant (red) symptoms. Agents showing significant
symptoms (red) do not move but can infect “visitors” if
actively approaching them.

To connect the suggested model with standard meanfield descriptions for infectious diseases, we now deduce a
continuum model from the Langevin equations describing
the agent dynamics. The resulting model can be viewed
as a generalization of standard mean-field models such
as the SIR and the SEIR model to inhomogeneous situations and cases where mild and strong infections coexist
(as for Covid-19). Let us now consider continuous variables (fields) representing the local mean number density
of susceptible agents S(r, t), exposed agents E(r, t) (infected but not yet diseased), infected agents which are
free of symptoms (or have mild symptoms) F (r, t), infected agents with symptoms I(r, t), recovered (immune)
agents R(r, t) and victims V (r, t). In the absence of social forces (pair attractions, social distancing), the following equations follow by translating Langevin equations to
Smoluchowski equations [43] and coupling them via suit-

vaccination rate ν = 0.1N/tD and initial reproduction number R0 = 2.5. (The latter is based on D = 102 Rc2 /tD , βo = 0.3,
βr = 0.1; see Methods); L = 500Rc ; curves are averaged over 100 random initial ensembles with N = 6000.

Note here that the exposed state explicitly shows up as
a dynamical variable at the continuum level, but only
implicitly in our agent-based simulations where infected
agents have an inner clock and are in the latent phase
before showing (mild) symptoms. In the above equations, β 0 is the infection rate, i.e. 1/β 0 is the mean
time between infectious contacts; α = 1/tL is the rate
to switch from the exposed (latent) state to the infected
state, δ = 1/(tD − tL ) is the recovery rate and ν 0 (r, t)
is the spatiotemporal vaccination rate which is linked to
the constant total
R vaccination rate in the agent-based
model via ν = dr ν 0 (r, t). The number r is the ratio of infections proceeding symptom free (or with mild

symptoms) and ρ0 = N/L2 is the mean agent density. Finally, D is the diffusion coefficient and f (r) = −∇r U/γ
is the reduced force due to the external potential which
we use to create a density profile mimicking a typical
city size distribution. The overall density converges to
a Boltzmann distribution
S+E+F +I +R+V =
R
N exp[−U (r)/(kT )]/
exp[−U (r)/(kT )]dr, yielding the
R
conservation law (S + E + F + I + R + V ) dr = N
which can be viewed as an expression of the conservation
of the overall number density (or the number of agents)
in the coarse of the dynamics.
Numerically solving this model by using finite difference
simulations now allows us to further test the spatiotemporal vaccination strategies. In our simulations we start
with the initial state E = F = R = V = 0 and S = 1 − ,
I =  where (r, t) represents a small perturbation of the
unstable steady state (e.g. E = F = I = R = V =
0, S = 1 for U = 0), which represents the population before the emergence of the disease. The results of these
simulations confirm that the spatiotemporal distribution
of continously distributed vaccines plays an important
role; also here, the infection-weighted strategy and the
focusing strategy strongly increase the number of sur-

We now perform numerical simulations of both the
proposed agent based model and the statistical meanfield model which both lead to consistent results. For
the agent based model we perform Brownian dynamics
simulations [44–49] starting with 2 × 10−3 N randomly
distributed initial infections and an initial reproduction
number R0 = 2.5 such that infection numbers exponentially increase over time. Let us assume that vaccine
production starts after some initial transient and then
allows to transfer ν individuals per day from the susceptible to the immune state. (Note that the duration of
the initial transient is unimportant in our simulations, if
vaccination starts long before herd immunity is reached.)
Now considering the time-evolution of the percentage of
infected, dead and recovered individuals of a given population, and distributing the available vaccines proportionally to the population density (bronze curves in Fig. 2),
we observe an infection maximum (panel a) about 30
days (two infection cycles) after the onset of vaccine production, i.e. when about 22% of the population have
received vaccines and 2% of the population is infected.
When distributing the available vaccines proportionally
to the local infection rate (“infection weighted strategy”)
instead, notably, the infection maximum occurs an entire
infection cycle earlier (silver curve in panel a). Here the
infection number peaks when only 11% of the population
has received vaccines and only 1% is infected. However,
the infection weighted strategy is not optimal but can
be further improved by exclusively providing all available vaccines to the region (e.g. a city) with the highest infection rate (“focusing strategy”). This means that
initially only a single region receives vaccines until the
infection rate of a second region catches up and both regions simultaneously receive vaccines, until a third region
catches up and so on. Following this “focusing strategy”
the infection peak further shifts to earlier times (golden
curve in panel a) and occurs when only 0.6% of the population is infected. Importantly, the resulting fraction
of deaths reduces by more than a factor of two when
following the infection weighted strategy (silver) rather
than the demographic strategy (bronze). It almost halves
again when following the focusing strategy instead (gold).
This shows that the precise spatial and temporal order of
vaccine donation controls the number of survivors from
an infectious disease.
We now complement these results by numerical solutions
of the statistical mean-field model equations by finitedifference simulations. As in our particle based simulations we find that the focusing strategy is generally better than the infection-weighted strategy and the demographic vaccine distribution strategy. The results of the
agent-based simulations and the continuum simulations
show a close quantitative agreement (not shown for the

comparison in the presence of ’cities’.).
To systematically explore the robustness of these findings we now repeat our simulations for different vaccine
production rates and initial reproduction numbers. Fig.
3 shows that the resulting fraction of deaths, counted
once the disease is gone, is generally highest for the demographic strategy (bronze) and lowest for the focusing
strategy (gold). Mathematically, this is because vaccination is most efficient at locations where it maximally
reduces the infection growth rate, which holds true independently of the specific parameter regime. The differences among the individual strategies is comparatively
large if vaccine is produced fast enough to allow vaccinating at least about 1% of the population per day and
at reproduction rates around R0 ∼ 2 − 3. The latter
value might be sensible for Covid-19. However, even for
slower vaccine production or for R0 ∼ 1 − 2 (as typical
for influenza), several percent of deaths can be avoided in
our simulations by strategically distributing the available
vaccines in space and time.
To further explore the applicability-regime of the focusing strategy, we now combine it with social distancing
rules, which reduce the effective reproduction number to
Rt ∼ 1. We implement the latter as a phenomenological
repulsive three-body interaction among the agents (see
Methods for details) which prevents them from aggregating in groups of more than two individuals. Also here, the
resulting deaths fraction (Fig. 4a) saturates significantly
earlier when following the focusing strategy (gold) rather
than the demographic strategy (bronze). The difference
in deaths numbers among the three different vaccination
strategies is almost identical to our corresponding results
at R0 ∼ 1 but without social distancing (Fig. 3b).
Finally, we explore a possible impact of a nonuniform
population distribution (city structure) on the proposed
vaccination strategies. We create a population with a
spatial density distribution following Zipf’s law which

DISCUSSION

Our simulations suggest that a strategic spatiotemporal distribution of gradually produced vaccines generically increases the number of survivors in ongoing epidemic disease. In particular, by sequentially prioritizing
spatial regions (cities) with the highest local infection
growth rates, the proposed “focusing strategy” reduces
the number of deaths by more than a factor of two compared to the standard practice of distributing vaccines
demographically. Such a strong difference occurs for locally well-mixed populations and a large range of initial
reproduction numbers (R0 ∼ 1.5−4) and vaccine production rates and even in combination with additional social
distancing measures, if the underlying infection pattern is
sufficiently inhomgeneous and vaccine production starts
long before the population reaches herd immunity. For
R0 ∼ 1 we still find a reduction of the fraction of death
by up to about 35%. Our results might excite discussions
regarding the importance of the spatiotemporal distribu-

closely describes the city size distribution in most countries [50] as P̃c (s > S) ∝ 1/S, where P̃c (s) is the probability that a city is larger than S. To generate a population featuring a corresponding population distribution,
we add an external potential U to the equation of motion of the agents (see Methods for details). Following statistical mechanics, the resulting population density follows Boltzmann’s law P (r) ∝ exp[−U (r)/(kT )]
where P (r) is the probability that an agent is at position
r and kT = γD is the effective thermal energy of the
agents, controlling how often agents leave a “city” (minimum of U ). Now matching Boltzmann’s distribution
with Zipf’s law yields a construction rule for U (see Methods) to create a population pattern featuring a characteristic city-size distribution. Our resulting simulations,
shown in Fig. 4b, and in the supplementary movie (for
N = 55.000 agents), demonstrate that the focusing strategy and the infection weighted-strategy again halve the
number of deaths compared to the demographic strategy.
Here, the former two strategies are comparatively close
to each other regarding the number of resulting deaths,
which indicates that in strongly inhomogeneous populations a suitable spatial vaccine distribution rule might be
even more important than the precise temporal sequence
of vaccine donation.
To further test the robustness of these findings, we have
performed continuum simulations of our statistical meanfield model, which leads to close quantitative agreement
with the particle based simulations (Fig. 4b). Typical
snapshots of the infection pattern 56 days after the onset
of vaccination are shown in Fig. 5. These figures show
a clear reduction of the infection number in all infection
hotspots for the focusing strategy (panel c) as compared
to the infection weighted strategy (b) and in particular
compared to the demographic vaccine distribution practice (a).

Methods

Simulation details:
To calculate the spatial dynamics of the agents
√ in our
model, we solve Langevin equations ṙi (t) = 2Dηi (t)
with i = 1, .., N using Brownian dynamics simulations
involving a forward Euler time-stepping algorithm and a
time-step of dt = 0.0028 days which amounts to about 4
minutes. After each timestep we check for each infected
agent (red or orange) which susceptible agents (grey) are
closer than Rc . We then change the state of the latter
agents to an infected state with an infection rate of β̃o =
3β̃r = 0.0075/dt (Figs. 2-4a), corresponding to infections
with mild symptoms (orange) and significant symptoms
(red), respectively. These rates yield βo = 3βr = 0.3
for the corresponding fractions of contacts which lead to
infections.
City size structure:
To generate a population density distribution with a
structure which is typical for cities, we add an external potential landscape U (r) to the Langevin equations
describing
the dynamics of the agents, i.e. ṙi (t) =
√
2Dη(t) − ∇ri U (ri )/γ. Here γ is an effective “drag”
coefficient determining the strength of the response of
the agents to U . We now create U as a superposition of
(r−rj )2
−
P
2
Gaussians, U (r) = j ae 2σj , each of which leads to
a population density maximum around rj , which represents the center of city j. Here a is the strength (amplitude) of the reduced potential which we choose as
a = Dγ/2 = kT /2 and σj defines the radius of city j,
which we choose randomly from a distribution P (σ) =
1
1
σ ln(Rmax /Rmin ) where Rmin = 20Rc and Rmax = 80Rc
are the minimal and the maximal possible “city radius”
in the simulations underlying Fig. 4b. We randomly distribute the city centers rj within the simulation box.
Social distancing:

To effectively model social distancing in a simple way,
we phenomenologically add repulsive excluded volume interactions among the agents which prevent that groups
of more
P than two agents form. That is, we choose
U = 21 k,l6=k Vkl νkl where the sums run over all agents
and where Vkl represents the Weeks-Chandler-Anderson
interaction
potential
h
i among agents k, l, i.e. Vkl =
4 ( rdkl )12 − ( rdkl )6 +  if rkl ≤ 21/6 d and Vkl = 0 otherwise. Here rkl denotes the distance between agents k
and l and rcut = 21/6 d represents a cutoff radius beyond which the interaction potential is zero;  controls
the strength of the potential and is chosen such that
/γ = D. In our simulations at each timestep we choose
νkl = 1 if at least one of the agent k and l has a “neighbor” at a distance closer than d = 3Rc and otherwise
we choose νkl = 0. In addition, we add a weak pair
attraction of strength D/10 and range d = 3Rc to our
simulations to support the formation of pairs. That way,
agents can form pairs but there is a significantly reduced
probability that they form triplets or larger groups.
Relation of reproduction number to simulation
parameters:
Here we relate the effective reproduction number Re (t),
which is the average number of infections caused by an
infected agent at time t, with the microscopic parameters
in our simulation. For this purpose, let us first consider
the area A(t) covered by a Brownian agent with radius
Rc and diffusion coefficient D over a time t. This area is
known as the Wiener sausage [51] and reads

A(t) =

where J0 (y) and Y0 (y) are the 0-th Bessel functions of
the first and second kind. Now denoting the agent density of susceptible agents with ρS , the average number of
(possibly infectious) contacts during a time τ is A(τ )ρS .
Thus, if agents are infectious over an overall time of tD
and the fraction of contacts which lead to infections with

7
significant (mild) symptoms is βr (βo ), we obtain the
following expression for the (spatially averaged) effective
reproduction number Re :

at time t.

where Re (t = 0) = R0 . This expression links the reproduction number with the microscopic simulation parameters and reveals that the reproduction number at time t is
proportional to the average density of susceptible agents

Supplementary Movie:
The movie shows the time-evolution of the modeled infection pattern for N = 55.000 agents and its response to
the proposed spatiotemporal vaccine distribution strategies. Parameters are as in Fig. 4b and the population
distribution in the movie follows a typical city size structure (Zipf’s law).
