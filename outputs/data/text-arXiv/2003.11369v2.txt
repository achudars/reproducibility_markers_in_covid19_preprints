Abstract
Considering the modified entropy-area relation from DSR-GUP (Doubly special
relativity-Generalized uncertainity principle), we obtain the modified Friedmann equations from the first law of thermodynamics at apparent horizon. Due to the importance
of GUP at Planck scale, we investigate the Friedmann equations and show the maximum energy density ρ at Planck scale. Since GUP implies a minimal length, we find a
minimum apparent horizon which has a potential to remove the Big Bang singularity.
Furthermore, we analyse the effects of DSR-GUP on deceleration parameter q for the
equation of state p = ωρ and the flat case. Finally, we check the validity of the generalized second law (GSL) of thermodynamics and show that it is valid for all eras of
the universe for any spatial curvature.
Keywords: Cosmology; DSR-GUP; generalized uncertainty principle.

Introduction

Considering black holes as the thermodynamic systems reveals the fundamental connection
between the gravity and laws of thermodynamics [1–6]. A black hole has temperature and
entropy proportional to its surface gravity and horizon area, respectively. Motivated by the
thermodynamics properties of black hole, Jacobson [7] first interpreted the Einstein field
equation as an equation of state. He derived the field equation from the proportionality of
entropy and horizon area together with Clausius relation δQ = T dS which connects the heat,
temperature and entropy. Later, the deeper fundamental connection between gravitational
dynamics and horizon thermodynamics was indicated in many papers [8–25]. Motivated by
Jacobson’s work, Cai and Kim [10] obtained the (n + 1)-dimensional Friedmann equations
from the first law of thermodynamics (−dE = Th dSh ) at apparent horizon. Here −dE is
interpreted as the amount of energy flux crossing the apparent horizon for the infinitesimal
time interval at fixed horizon radius. We assume that the apparent horizon has temperature
and entropy given as follows:
Th =

1
,
2π r˜A

Sh =

A
,

(1)

where A is the area of the apparent horizon1 . Using the corresponding entropy-area formula
in the Gauss-Bonnet and Lovelock gravities, they were derived the Friedmann equations in
each gravity. Following Cai and Kim’s approach, Friedmann equations in the scalar−tensor
and f (R) gravities were obtained in Ref. [11] 2 . Despite one can obtain the Friedmann
equations in [10], it can be seen that the temperature of apparent horizon is not proportional
to surface gravity κ of the horizon, since surface gravity is given by

where dot denotes the derivative with respect to time and H is Hubble parameter. Since
the r˜A does not change, the first law of thermodynamics, which is proposed in Ref. [10], is
satisfied. However, this approximation has a limitation on the equation of state as p ≈ −ρ,
i.e., equation of state implies the vacuum energy or de Sitter spacetime. Assuming the
κ
temperature Th = 2π
and entropy Sh = A4 , Akbar and Cai [12] showed that the differential
form of Friedmann equations can be rewritten as the first law of thermodynamics at apparent
horizon
dE = Th dSh + W dV,

We use the units h̄ = c = GN = lP2 l = 1
We recall that the extended gravity framework arises from the necessity to extend standard general
relativity in order to attempt to achieve the famous Dark Energy and Dark Matter problems [26]. In
this framework, the recent starting of the gravitational wave astronomy with the famous detections of
LIGO [27] could be, in principle, decisive to confirm the physical consistence of standard general relativity,
or, alternatively, to endorse the framework of extended theories of gravity [28]. In fact, some differences
between general relativity and alternative theories can be pointed out in the linearized theory of gravity
through different interferometer response functions [28].

where W is the work density which is given in terms of energy density ρ and pressure p of
the matter in the universe, E = ρV is the total energy inside the apparent horizon, and V
is the volume of the apparent horizon.
On the other hand, it is well known that entropy-area relation can be modified via
various quantum gravity (QG) approaches [29–31] since the QG effects are remarkable at
the Planck scale. For example, motivated by loop quantum gravity (LQG), a modified
version of Friedmann equations was obtained in Refs. [15,16]. Besides LQG, one can consider
modification of entropy-area relation from GUP which is one of the phenomenological QG
model and a modification of the standard uncertainty principle [34–36]. One of the most
characteristic implications in GUP is the concept of minimal length. Since the minimal
length notion may cure the singularities in general relativity, it is also interesting to consider
both applications of black hole thermodynamics and cosmology in the context of the GUP
[37–52]. Taking into account the simplest form of GUP, Awad and Ali [17] obtained the
modified Friedmann equations. They showed that modified Friedmann equations exhibit
the maximum energy denisty (order of Planck energy density) at minimal length. Their
work extended in Ref. [18] for a new version of GUP. Similarly, an upper bound was shown
for the energy of universe. Furthermore, it is possible to define a cyclic universe from the
modified GUP. Another modification of standart uncertainty principle may be considered in
the context of DSR. We recall that DSR modifies standard special relativity by adding an
observer-independent maximum energy scale and minimum length scale (the Planck energy
and Planck length) to the observer-independent maximum velocity (the speed of light)of
standard special relativity [53]. In Refs. [32, 33], authors considered the GUP based on DSR
and renamed it as DSR-GUP. Apart from special relativity, DSR also has an extra upper
bound as Planck energy. Therefore, DSR plays a crucial role in investigating the quantum
gravity effects near the Planck scale. Motivated by this, we would like to investigate the
modified Friedmann equations for the DSR-GUP in the present paper.
The paper is organized as follows: In the next section, we review the DSR-GUP and
obtain the modified entropy-area relation. In the third section, we obtain the modified
Friedmann equation from DSR-GUP. In the fourth section, we investigate the effects of
DSR-GUP on deceleration parameter. In the fifth section, we check the validity of GSL for
the modified Friedmann equations. Finally, the conclusions are presented in the last section.

GUP based on DSR

In this section, we briefly review the DSR-GUP and calculate modified entropy-area relation
[32, 33]. Let us start to give the new form of GUP which is based on DSR

Moreover, the smallest increase of the black hole area can be considered as

when a particle is absorbed by a black hole. Therefore, we obtain the increase of area

where γ is the calibration factor. We know that minimum increase of entropy (∆S)min = ln 2

Modified Friedmann equations

We firstly start to review the basic elements of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe. The line element of FRW universe is given by
ds2 = hab dxa dxb + r̃dΩ2 ,

(10)

where r̃ = a(t)r, a is the scale factor, xa = (t, r), hab = diag (−1, a2 /(1 − kr 2 )) is two
dimensional metric, and k corresponds to the values −1, 0, 1 for the open, flat and closed
universe, respectively. The dynamical apparent horizon is given by
r˜A = ar = p

where H = ȧ/a is the Hubble parameter. The temperature of the apparent horizon is
obtained from Eq.(2)

Since entropy is the function of area, we can write the general expression for entropy in the

and the differential of entropy is given by

(14)

where prime denotes the derivative with respect to area A = 4π r˜A 2 . By assuming the the
matter and energy of the universe as an ideal fluid, so energy-momentum tensor yields
Tµν = (ρ + p)uµ uν + pgµν

(15)

where uµ is the four velocity of fluid. The conservation of energy-momentum tensor, i.e.,
T;νµν = 0 leads to the continuity equation as
ρ̇ + 3H(ρ + p) = 0.

(16)

Following the arguments of Ref. [54], we can define the work density as
1

W = − T ab hab = (ρ − p).

(17)

Work density W corresponds to work done by the volume change of universe. Now, we
can calculate the terms of Eq. (3). Since the volume and the total energy of universe are
V = 34 π r˜A 3 and E = ρV , differential of E is given by using the continuity equations in
Eq.(16)
dE = ρdV + V dρ = 4πρr˜A 2 dr˜A − 4π(ρ + p)r˜A 3 Hdt,
(18)
and W dV term is calculated as
W dV = 2π(ρ − p)r˜A 2 dr˜A .

Finally, T dS term is found

Note that the modified Friedmann equations can be reduced to the standard forms in the
limits of α → 0 and ǫp → ∞.
Now, let us investigate the Eq.(27). In order to get a real and positive energy density ρ,

r̃A should has a minimum value which is given by

(28)

which removes the singularity at the beginning. We stress that such a removal of the initial
singularity depends on the quantum behavior of the GUP of Eq.(4). The GUP expressed
by Eq.(4) implies indeed a non-zero lower bound on the minimum value of the uncertainty
on the particles’ position (∆x) which is of order of the Planck length. This issue has no
classical correspondence because in standard general relativity all time-like radial geodesics
of the particles in the Universe start at the ”initial point” r˜A = 0 and it is impossible to
extend the global space-time manifold beyond that ”initial point”. This is the meaning of the
classical initial singularity. At the minimum apparent horizon, we can obtain the maximum
5ǫ2P
allowed value of energy density as ρmax = 4π(1−2α)
2 + Λ for the inflationary scale. Since Λ is
6

too small, it can be neglected and we can easily see that energy density is order of Planck
energy. Apart from standard Friedmann equations, we find a non-zero minimum apparent
horizon and finite maximum energy density for the modified Friedmann equations. It is also
clear that r̃Amin goes to zero and ρmax diverges in the limits of α → 0 and ǫp → ∞.
Using the Eq.(11), we give the Friedmann equation in term of Hubble parameter H as

where the positive q implies deceleration, while negative q implies the acceleration. Now,

for the flat case k = 0. We choose the Euclidean case for the shape of the Universe because
it seems in agreement with current cosmological observations [26]. Except the vacuum

we calculate the value of deceleration parameter for the inflationary stage. At the minimal

for the inflationary stage. Interestingly, we find that ω should satisfy the condition ω < −3/5

the deceleration parameter as follows:

respectively. Remind that 0 < α < 1/2, correction term certainly gives the positive contribution to both cases. So taking into account effects of DSR-GUP, we can deduce that
expansion of universe is more decelerated for the radiation and matter dominated eras.
Furthermore, DSR-GUP effects are not an alternative to dark energy (DE) for the matter
dominated universe since Eq.(37) is always positive3 . Since the correction term in Eq.(35)
is too small for the late time, one may consider that most contribution comes from the first
term. Eq.(35) implies that it must be ω < −1/3 to explain the acceleration of late time
universe. Therefore, we still need DE for the late time of universe.

Generalized second law of thermodynamics

In this section, we want to check the validity of the GSL in the presence of DSR-GUP.
According to the GSL of thermodynamics, total entropies of matter fields and apparent
horizon do not decrease with time. Rearranging the Eq.(22), one can obtain

It is clear that the sign of Eq.(38) depends on the sign of ρ + p. Combining the Eqs.(38) and
(20), we obtain the following expression as

(39)
4r˜A 2 ǫ2p
which may violate the second law of thermodynamics for accelerated universe. Therefore,
we should check the validity of GSL of thermodynamics.
3

In contrast to our results, an accelerated universe is possible without the invoking DE. The reader may
refer to Refs. [24] and [55] which consider Tsallis and rainbow gravity corrections to Friedmann equations,
respectively.

8

Now, let us consider the Gibbs equation [56] which is defined as
Tm dSm = d(ρV ) + pdV = V dρ + (ρ + p)dV,

(40)

where Tm and Sm are the temperature and the entropy of the matter fields inside the horizon.
We use the assumption that the apparent horizon remains in equilibrium with the system.
So we have Tm = Th . Form Eq.(40), we can find

which is useful to check the GSL of thermodynamics. The right hand side of the above
equation is always a non-decreasing for the all eras of the universe. Therefore, the GSL of
thermodynamics is always valid for the all eras of the universe.

Conclusions

In this work, we obtained the DSR-GUP modified Friedmann equations from the first law
of thermodynamics at apparent horizon. We investigated the modified Friedmann equations
since GUP effects are not negligible at Planck scale. We showed a nonzero minimum apparent
horizon which leads to a maximum and finite energy density. These may have the potential
to remove the singularity at beginning of universe. Moreover, we studied the DSR-GUP
effects on the deceleration parameter for the flat case and equation of state as p = ωρ. We
found that acceleration at the beginning of inflation imply the condition ω < −3/5. The
effects of DSR-GUP were also investigated for the radiation and matter dominated eras. The
deceleration parameter is still positive in the presence of DSR-GUP. DSR-GUP may have
contribution to deceleration for the radiation and matter dominated eras. Hence, DSR-GUP
effects are not an alternative to DE for the matter dominated universe. As for the late
time, we still need DE to explain the accelerated late time expansion. Finally, we checked
the validity of GSL of thermodynamics and found that it is always valid for the all eras of
universe.
In contrast to standard Friedmann equations, the DSR-GUP modified Friedmann equations have more reasonable and acceptable properties such as minimal length and maximum
energy density.
For the sake of completeness, we take the opportunity to cite some further important
work on the GUP [57–60]. In particular, in [59] the Authors introduced modification of the
background metric due to GUP, while in [60] interesting cosmological consequences of the
GUP have been discussed.
