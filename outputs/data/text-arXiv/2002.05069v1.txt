Abstract
The initial cluster of severe pneumonia cases that triggered the 2019-nCoV epidemic was
identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. While early cases of the disease were linked to a
wet market, human-to-human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout
China. The Chinese government has implemented containment strategies of city-wide
lockdowns, screening at airports and train stations, and isolation of suspected patients; however,
the cumulative case count keeps growing every day. The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge
for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the epidemiological
characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated.
We use phenomenological models that have been validated during previous outbreaks to
generate and assess short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in
Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding
the province of Hubei. We collect daily reported cumulative case data for the 2019-nCoV
outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health Commission of China. Here, we
provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five consecutive days: February 5th through February 9th,
with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth
model, and a sub-epidemic wave model.
Our most recent forecasts reported here are based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely
agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7,409 ‚Äì 7,496 additional
cases in Hubei and 1,128 ‚Äì 1,929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days.
Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 ‚Äì 38,028 in Hubei
and 11,588 ‚Äì 13,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020.

Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have remained
relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th ‚Äì 9th). We also observe that each of
the models predicts that the epidemic has reached saturation in both Hubei and other provinces.
Our findings suggest that the containment strategies implemented in China are successfully
reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has slowed in recent days.

Introduction
The ongoing epidemic of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is primarily affecting mainland
China and can be traced back to a cluster of severe pneumonia cases identified in Wuhan, China
in December 2019 (Li et al., 2020; World Health Organization, 2020). Early cases of the disease
have been linked to a live animal seafood market in Wuhan, pointing to a zoonotic origin of the
epidemic. However, human-to-human transmission has driven its rapid spread with a total of
37,289 confirmed cases, including 813 deaths, in China and 302 confirmed cases imported in
multiple countries as of February 9, 2020 (Chinese National Health Committee). While the early
transmission potential of this novel coronavirus appeared similar to that of severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Riou & Althaus, 2020), the current tally of the epidemic has
already surpassed the total cases reported for the SARS outbreaks in 2002-2003 (W. World
Health Organization, 2003; Wu, Leung, & Leung, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020).
The timing and location of the outbreak facilitated the rapid transmission of the virus within a
highly mobile population. The initial reporting of observed cases occurred during the traditional

Chinese New Year, when the largest population movement in China takes place every year (Ai et
al., 2020). Further, Wuhan is a highly populated city with more than 11 million residents and is
connected to many cities in China through public transportation, such as buses, trains, and flights
(Lai et al., 2020; Read, Bridgen, Cummings, Ho, & Jewell, 2020). In the absence of
pharmaceutical interventions, rapid action was required by the Chinese government to mitigate
transmission within and outside of Wuhan.
On January 23, 2020, the Chinese government implemented a strict lockdown of Wuhan,
followed by several nearby cities in subsequent days; the lockdown includes temporarily
restricting public transportation and advising residents to remain at home (Du et al., 2020; Wu et
al., 2020). Further, many high-speed rail stations and airports have implemented screening
measures to detect travelers with a fever, specifically those traveling from Wuhan, and those
with a fever are referred to public hospitals (Lai et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). Within hospitals,
patients who fulfill clinical and epidemiological characteristics of 2019-nCoV are immediately
isolated.
The number of 2019-nCoV cases in Wuhan quickly outnumbered the available number of beds
in hospitals, putting a substantial burden on the healthcare system. Consequently, the
government rapidly built and launched two new hospitals with capacity for 1,600 and 1,000
beds, respectively, in Wuhan in addition to the existing 132 quarantine sites with more than
12,500 beds (Steinbuch, 2020). To anticipate additional resources to combat the epidemic,
mathematical and statistical modeling tools can be useful to generate timely short-term forecasts
of reported cases. These predictions can include estimates of expected morbidity burden that can
help guide public health officials preparing the medical care and other resources needed to
confront the epidemic. Short-term forecasts can also guide the intensity and type of interventions

needed to mitigate an epidemic (Funk, Camacho, Kucharski, Eggo, & Edmunds, 2016; Shanafelt,
Jones, Lima, Perrings, & Chowell, 2017). In the absence of vaccines or antiviral drugs for 2019nCoV, the effective implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as personal
protection and social distancing, will be critical to bring the epidemic under control.
In this emerging epidemic, the epidemiological data is limited, and the epidemiological
parameters needed to calibrate elaborate mechanistic transmission models are not yet fully
elucidated. Real-time short-term forecasts must be based on dynamic phenomenological models
that have been validated during previous outbreaks (Chowell et al., 2016; Pell, Kuang, Viboud,
& Chowell, 2018). We employ several dynamic models to generate and assess 5, 10, and 15 day
ahead forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of
the epidemic, and the overall trajectory of the epidemic in China excluding the province of
Hubei.

Methods
Data
We obtained daily updates of the cumulative number of reported confirmed cases for the 2019nCoV epidemic across provinces in China from the National Health Commission of China
website (Chinese National Health Commission). The data contains 34 areas, including provinces,
municipalities, autonomous regions, and special administrative regions; here we refer to the
regions collectively as provinces. Data updates were collected daily at 12 pm (GMT-5), between
January 22, 2020 and February 9, 2020. The short time-series is affected by irregularities and
reporting lags, so the cumulative curves are more stable and likely yield more stable and reliable

estimates. Therefore, we analyze the cumulative trajectory of the epidemic in Hubei province,
the epicenter of the outbreak, as well as the cumulative aggregate trajectory of all other
provinces.

Models
We generate short-term forecasts in real-time using three phenomenological models that have
been previously used to derive short-term forecasts for a number of epidemics for several
infectious diseases, including SARS, Ebola, pandemic influenza, and dengue (Chowell, Tariq, &
Hyman, 2019; Pell et al., 2018; Wang, Wu, & Yang, 2012). The generalized logistic growth
model (GLM) extends the simple logistic growth model to accommodate sub-exponential growth
dynamics with a scaling of growth parameter, p (Viboud, Simonsen, & Chowell, 2016). The
Richards model also includes a scaling parameter, a, to allow for deviation from the symmetric
logistic curve (Chowell, 2017; Richards, 1959; Wang et al., 2012). We also include a recently
developed sub-epidemic wave model that supports complex epidemic trajectories, including
multiple peaks (i.e., SARS in Singapore (Chowell et al., 2019)). In this approach, the observed
reported curve is assumed to be the aggregate of multiple underlying sub-epidemics (Chowell et
al., 2019). A detailed description for each of the models is included in the Supplement.

Short-term forecasts
We calibrate each model to the daily cumulative reported case counts for Hubei and other
provinces (all except Hubei). While the outbreak began in December 2019, available data on
cumulative case counts were available starting on January 22, 2020. Therefore, the first

calibration process includes 15 observations: from January 22, 2020 to February 5, 2020. Each
subsequent calibration period increases by one day with each new published daily data point,
with the last calibration period comprising the period from January 22, 2020 to February 9, 2020
(19 data points).
We estimate the best-fit model solution to the reported data using nonlinear least squares fitting.
This process yields the set of model parameters Œò that minimizes the sum of squared errors
between the model ùëì(ùë°, ùõ©) and the data ùë¶( ; where ŒòGLM = (r, p, K), ŒòRich = (r, a, K), and ŒòSub =

and the sub-epidemic model, respectively; parameter descriptions are provided in the

We then use a parametric bootstrap approach to quantify uncertainty around the best-fit solution,
assuming a Poisson error structure. A detailed description of this method is provided in prior
studies (Chowell, 2017; Roosa & Chowell, 2019). The models are refitted to the M = 200
bootstrap datasets to obtain M parameter sets, which are used to define 95% confidence intervals
for each parameter. Each of the M model solutions to the bootstrap curves is used to generate m
= 30 simulations extended through a forecasting period of 15 days. These 6,000 (M √ó m) curves
are used to construct the 95% prediction intervals for the forecasts.

Results
We generated 5, 10, and 15 day ahead forecasts for Hubei and other provinces excluding Hubei
for 5 consecutive starting dates: February 5, 2020 to February 9, 2020. Figures 1 ‚Äì 3 represent

the range of 5, 10, and 15 day ahead forecasts, respectively, by the date generated, and we
compare the daily short-term forecasts of cumulative case counts across dates as more data
become available. Current cumulative reported case counts as of February 9, 2020 are 27,100 for
Hubei and 10,189 in other provinces (Chinese National Health Commission).

Model calibration
Our results for Hubei province indicate that the parameter estimates for the three models tend to
stabilize and decrease in uncertainty as more data become available (Supplemental Table 1). In
particular, the growth rate r decreases and appears to be converging over time, particularly for
the GLM and sub-epidemic model. Parameter K also follows this general trend, with prediction
intervals decreasing significantly in width as more data become available. Importantly, the p
estimates from the GLM indicate that the epidemic growth in Hubei is close to exponential (p
=0.99 (95%CI: 0.98, 1) ‚Äì February 9th). Further, growth rate and scaling parameter estimates
have remained relatively stable over the last three reporting dates, while estimates of K are still
declining. This may correlate with the effectiveness of control measures or the slowing of the
epidemic.
For the trajectory that aggregates all other provinces (excluding Hubei), the parameter estimates
follow trends that differ from those for Hubei (Supplemental Table 2). While the three models
estimated stable and nearly equivalent growth rates in Hubei, the estimated growth rates for other
provinces vary across models and do not follow a distinct trend as more data become available.
However, the scaling and size parameters remain relatively stable across all dates. Further, the p

estimates from the GLM reveal a consistent sub-exponential growth pattern in other provinces (p
= 0.67 (95%CI: 0.64, 0.70) ‚Äì February 9th).

5 days ahead
The latest 5 day ahead forecasts, generated on February 9, 2020, estimate an average of 34,509 ‚Äì
34,596 total cumulative cases in Hubei by February 14, 2020 across the three models (Figure 1a).
For other provinces, the models predict an average range of 11,317 ‚Äì 12,118 cumulative cases by
February 14 (Figure 1b). Based on cumulative reported cases as of February 9th, these estimates
correspond with an average of 7,409 ‚Äì 7,496 additional cases in Hubei and 1,128 ‚Äì 1,929
additional cases in other provinces within the next 5 days.
Comparing the 5-day ahead forecasts generated daily on February 5 ‚Äì 9, 2020, the GLM and
Richards models yield comparable prediction intervals in Hubei, while the sub-epidemic model
yields wider intervals than the other models. Also, 5 day ahead forecasts from the sub-epidemic
model on February 5th and 6th predict significantly higher case counts in Hubei compared to
forecasts generated on February 7th and beyond (Figure 1a). For other provinces, the GLM and
Richards model yield intervals of similar widths, but the GLM predicts higher case counts than
the Richards model across all dates (Figure 1b). Further, the sub-epidemic model has
significantly wider prediction intervals compared to the other models for all forecasts for other
provinces. While the uncertainty of the predictions decreases as more data became available in
Hubei, the uncertainty of the predictions for other provinces remain relatively stable, compared
to forecasts from earlier dates.

10 days ahead
The 10 day ahead forecasts generated on February 9, 2020 from the three models estimate
between 36,854 ‚Äì 37,230 cumulative cases, on average, in Hubei by February 19, 2020 (Figure
2a). For other provinces, the latest 10 day ahead forecasts predict average cumulative case counts
between 11,549 ‚Äì 13,069 cases across the three models (Figure 2b). These estimates correspond
with an additional 9,754 ‚Äì 10,130 cases in Hubei and an additional 1,360 ‚Äì 2,880 cases reported
in other provinces on average in the next 10 days.
10 day ahead forecasts of case counts in Hubei generated on February 5th show significantly
different results between the GLM and Richards versus the sub-epidemic model, with the subepidemic model predicting significantly higher case counts (Figure 2a). For forecasts generated
after February 5th, the prediction intervals of the three models are comparable, with the GLM
intervals having the lowest uncertainty, followed by the Richards model (Figure 2a). For other
provinces, the sub-epidemic model yields significantly wider prediction intervals than the other
two models. Like the 5 day ahead forecasts, the 10 day ahead prediction intervals become
increasingly narrow for Hubei when including more data, but uncertainty remains relatively
stable in other provinces.

15 days ahead
The latest 15 day ahead forecasts predict a cumulative reported case count between 37,415 ‚Äì
38,028 cases, on average, in Hubei by February 24, 2020. Further, the latest 15 day ahead
forecasts suggest an average cumulative case count between 11,588 ‚Äì 13,499 cases for other

provinces. These forecasts correspond with an additional 10,315 ‚Äì 10,928 cases in Hubei and an
additional 1,399 ‚Äì 3,310 cases in other provinces within the next 15 days.
Again, the sub-epidemic model yields significantly higher forecasts for Hubei on February 5th,
compared to the other models and compared to subsequent prediction intervals on following
dates (Figure 3a). The width of prediction intervals decreases as more data are included for each
of the models in both Hubei and other provinces. This is consistent with shorter-term forecasts in
Hubei but differs from the pattern of shorter-term forecasts in other provinces.

Discussion
In this report, we provide timely short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of reported cases
of the 2019-nCoV epidemic in Hubei province and other provinces in China as of February 9,
2020. As the epidemic continues, we are also publishing online daily 10-day ahead forecasts
including each of the models presented here (Roosa & Chowell, 2020). Based on the three
models calibrated to data up until February 9, 2020, we forecast a cumulative number of reported
cases between 37,415 ‚Äì 38,028 in Hubei Province and 11,588 ‚Äì 13,499 in other provinces by
February 24, 2020.
Our models yield a good visual fit to the epidemic curves, based on residuals, with the subepidemic model outperforming the other models in terms of the mean squared error (MSE)
(Supplemental Tables 1 & 2). Parameter estimation results from the GLM consistently show that
the epidemic growth is near exponential in Hubei and sub-exponential in other provinces.
Overall, models predict similar ranges of short-term forecasts, except for those generated on
February 5th, where the sub-epidemic model predicts significantly higher case counts than the

other two models (Figures 1 ‚Äì 3). The sub-epidemic model predicts similar ranges to the other
models for subsequent dates, so the higher ranges on February 5th may indicate that more data
are required to inform the parameters of the sub-epidemic model.
We observe that the width of the prediction intervals decreases on average as more data are
included for forecasts in Hubei; however, this pattern is not obvious for our analysis based on
other provinces. This can, in part, be attributed to the smaller case counts and smaller initial
prediction interval range seen in other provinces. Mean predictions and associated uncertainty
remain relatively stable in other provinces though, while the mean estimates of 10 and 15 days
ahead decrease significantly in Hubei (Figures 2 & 3). This suggests that the epidemic will last
longer in Hubei compared to other provinces (Figures 4 ‚Äì 6), which may be attributed to
intensive control efforts and large-scale social distancing interventions. Therefore, it is not
necessarily surprising that estimates from earlier dates, specifically prior to saturation, yield
predictions with higher uncertainty.
We retrieve the data from the Chinese media conglomerate Tencent (Chinese National Health
Commission); however, the data show small differences in case counts compared to data of the
epidemic reported by other sources (Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and
Engineering, 2020). Importantly, the curves of confirmed cases that we employ in our study are
reported according to reporting date and could be influenced by testing capacity and other related
factors. Further, there may be significant delays in identifying, isolating, and reporting cases in
Hubei due to the magnitude of the epidemic, which could influence our predictions. Incidence
curves according to the date of symptom onset could provide a clearer picture of the transmission
dynamics during an epidemic. We also note that we analyzed the epidemic curves starting on

January 22, 2020, but the epidemic started in December 2019. Hence, the first data point
accumulates cases up until January 22, 2020, as data were not available prior to this date.
The 2019-nCoV outbreak in China poses a major challenge for modelers, as there are limited
data available on the early growth trajectory, and epidemiological characteristics of the novel
strain have not been fully elucidated. Our timely short-term forecasts based on
phenomenological models can be useful for real-time preparedness, such as anticipating the
required number of hospital beds and other medical resources, as they provide an estimate of the
number of cases hospitals will need to prepare for in the coming days. In future work, we plan to
report the results of a retrospective analysis of forecasting performance across models based on
various performance metrics.
In conclusion, our most recent forecasts, based on data for the last three days (February 7th ‚Äì 9th),
remained relatively stable. These models predict that the epidemic has reached a saturation point
for both Hubei and other provinces. This likely reflects the impact of the wide spectrum of social
distancing measures implemented by the Chinese government, which likely helped stabilize the
epidemic. The forecasts presented are based on the assumption that current mitigation efforts will
continue.

Model descriptions
GLM
The generalized logistic growth model (GLM) is an extension of the simple logistic growth
model that includes an additional parameter, p, to allow for scaling of growth; p = 1 indicates
early exponential growth, p = 0 represents constant growth, and 0 < p < 1 accommodates early
sub-exponential or polynomial growth (G. Chowell et al., 2020; Ganyani, Roosa, Faes, Hens, &
Chowell, 2018; Roosa, Luo, & Chowell, 2019; Viboud, Simonsen, & Chowell, 2016). The GLM
is defined by the differential equation:
ùê∂ < (ùë°) = ùëüùê∂(ùë°)= (1 ‚àí

ùê∂(ùë°)
)
ùêæ

where C(t) represents the cumulative number of cases at time t, r is the growth rate, p is the
scaling of growth parameter, and K is the carrying capacity or final epidemic size.

Richards model
The Richards model is a 3-parameter extension of the simple logistic growth model that includes
a scaling parameter, a (Gerardo Chowell, 2017; Richards, 1959; Wang, Wu, & Yang, 2012). The
Richards model is defined by the differential equation:

ùê∂‚Ä≤(ùë°) = ùëüùê∂(ùë°) A1 ‚àí (

ùê∂(ùë°) B
) C
ùêæ

where C(t) represents the cumulative number of cases at time t, r is the growth rate, K is the final
epidemic size, and the exponent a measures the deviation from the symmetric s-shaped dynamics
of the simple logistic curve.

Sub-epidemic model
The most flexible extension employed here is the recently developed sub-epidemic wave model,
which supports complex epidemic trajectories by assuming the reported aggregate curve is
shaped by multiple underlying sub-epidemics (G. Chowell, Tariq, & Hyman, 2019). For this
approach, each sub-epidemic is modeled using the GLM, where the growth rate r and scaling
parameter p are the same across sub-epidemics. We model an epidemic wave composed of n
overlapping sub-epidemics as follows:
ùê∂D ‚Ä≤(ùë°) = ùëüùê¥DF8 (ùë°)ùê∂D (ùë°)= G1 ‚àí

K,

where Ci(t) is the cumulative number of infections for sub-epidemic i, and Ki is the size of the ith
sub-epidemic (i = 1, ‚Ä¶, n) (G. Chowell et al., 2019). Thus, when n = 1, the model returns to the
single-equation GLM, as presented above.
We model the timing of onset for each subsequent wave with a regular structure, such that the
(i+1)th sub-epidemic begins when Ci(t) exceeds the threshold Cthr, and the (i+1)th sub-epidemic
begins before the ith sub-epidemic is complete. We model the size of consecutive sub-epidemics
(Ki) such that the size declines exponentially. Thus,
ùêæD = ùêæL ùëí FN(DF8) ,

where K0 is the size of the first sub-epidemic (K1 = K0), and q is the rate of decline of consecutive
sub-epidemics, where q = 0 indicates no decline. Further, the total final size of the epidemic is
given by:
6QRQ

ùêæ(O( = P ùêæL ùëí

FN(DF8)
