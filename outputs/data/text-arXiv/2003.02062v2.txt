The COVID-19 epidemics, started in China in January 20201, was recognized
to have reached Italy around February 20; recent estimates show that most
probably the virus circulated in the country already in January, but was not
recognized.
The development of the epidemic in Italy was characterized by a rather
large number of new cases even in early days. This led to the isolation of two
relatively small areas – one with about 50,000 inhabitants and the other with
bout 3,000 ones – and in these areas the search for infected cases has been
performed by a wide number of laboratory exams, which led to the discovery of
a rather large number of cases with weak or no symptoms at all. In fact,about
50% of identified contagion cases are being teated by simple home isolation.
This should be compared with early data from China and in particular in
Wuhan (where the huge number of both serious medical cases and the total
population presumably prevented from screening contacts of infected people not
showing symptoms, except maybe for medical doctors most involved in fighting
the virus), which reported a very small number, of the order of a few percent,
of asymptomatic contagion [3].
On the other hand, the Chinese report made a well defined difference between
serious and less seriously affected patients, showing that the first case amounted
to about 20% of the total COVID-19 patients, all of whom were hospitalized.
In this note we want to discuss raw data for the Italian situation; in a companion paper we will put forward a very simple model (of the SIR type [7]) taking into account the presence of a large number of asymptomatic cases, many
of which are most probably not detected nor detectable except in very small

analysis from various sources, see e.g. [4], suggest first cases may have developed
earlier on, albeit not recognized as due to a new virus.

communities2 ; this will then be used to understand how much a prompt identification of similar cases (not practically feasible at this stage, but which could
become possible if rapid and economic tests would be commercially developed)
could help in reducing the spread of the infection.
The used data were obtained from the publicly available ones provided by
the daily Italian “Protezione Civile” reports [1] ; the total number of cases in
the country are also reported by W.H.O. [2]. General facts about the COVID-19
epidemics in China can be accessed though the China CDC early report [3] and
through the WHO-CDC document [5]; statistical and philogenetic analyses are
made publicby the Imperial College group [4].

1.1

Raw data
Benchmark: China

We start by recalling some facts and figures about the situation in China.
The spreading of COVID-19 in all of China (thus not making a distinction
between the Hubei region and the rest of the country) is summarized in the
semi-logarithmic plot of Figure 1. This shows that the growth rate α for the
number of total cases in day k,
n(k) = exp[α k] n(0)

(1)

passed from αi = 0.330 for the early period (in particular, this fit was obtained
for the period January 23 – February 2) to αf = 0.006 for the last available data
(in particular, this fit was obtained for for the period February 21 – March 2),
showing that the drastic measures taken by the Chinese government produced
a substantial effect.
The doubling time τ , obtained from the above via
τ = α−1 log(2) ,

(2)

passed correspondingly from τi = 2.1 to τf = 122.
The daily growth factor γ is determined as
γ = exp[α] ;

(3)

this passed from γi = 1.391 to γf = 1.006.
2 We understand that in the smaller of the isolated communities in Northern Italy, totalizing
about 3,000 inhabitants, a mass screening is being conducted; this should provide more reliable
data on the fraction of asymptomatic infections, together with other precious information.

counting was changed (clinical evidence being considered sufficient even
without laboratory test), leading to a sudden jump in the number of cases.

Benchmark: Korea

The Republic of Korea (also known as South Korea; population around 52,000,000)
is another country severely struck by COVID-19; this is also a relevant benchmark for the Italian situation given the similar population in the two countries
and the similar political system (parliamentary democracy). In this case there
was a sudden increase in the number of cases starting from February 19. In
this case the restrictive measures also led to some reduction in the propagation
speed of the epidemics, albeit of a smaller amount than in China.

National and regional data in Italy

The statistics of data from Northern Italy is (luckily) more limited, both for
what concerns the number of cases and the length of the time series. On the
other hand this makes that these time series, in view of the relative large incubation period for the COVID-19 infection, did not have the time to react to the
restrictive measures taken by the Italian government and to the modified habits
of the population; thus in building our model we will consider the epidemic
parameters as being constant over the time covered by these data.
The epidemic developed so far mainly in three regions: Lombardia, Veneto
and Emilia-Romagna; from now on these will be denoted as L, V, and ER
respectively (data referring to all of Italy will be denoted as I).
4

The total population of Italy is about 60,000,000; that of the mostly involved
regions is roughly as follows: Lombardia 10,000,000; Veneto 5,000,000; EmiliaRomagna 4,500,000. The two isolated areas (red areas) have a population of
50,000 for the Lombardia one and 3,000 for the Veneto one.
Publicly available data are divided for regions (we have not analyzed so far
special data about the “red areas”) and – limitedly to the overall count for all
of Italy – by the state of the patient; in particular these are subdivided into
the following classes (identified by an acronym in the following): Hospitalized
in Intensive Care units (IC); Hospitalized in standard care units (SC); Isolated
at home (HI); Recovered (REC); Dead (D).
At the date of this study, as far as we know, shortage of IC facilities was not
arising, so we assume that the state of the patient is well reflected by the type
of treatment he/she is undergoing.
The data for all of Italy and for the different regions are reported in figs.3 –6;
these are also fitted by an exponential law, but here the fit is performed on data
from day 3 (February 23) on, as in the first days there seem to be an anomalous
growth, most probably due to recognizing as COVID-19 occurrences of cases
which had been previous considered as standard flu with complications.3
The fit for the whole of Italy, and for the different considered regions, produces the following parameter α and related quantities:

The data available for all of Italy (I) and for these specific areas (denoted
respectively as L, V and E from now on) and concerning all the recognized
infected individuals, independently of the level of the symptoms, are as follows
3 This is indeed a delicate point in the statistical analysis, in particular in the early stage of
the epidemic: as the symptoms are very similar, it has to be assumed that a number of COVID
cases were not recognized when it was thought the virus had not yet struck the country –
needless to say, the same could happen in analyzing data from other countries.

More detailed local data for most affected departments

More detailed data, at the Department (Provincia) level, are available only from
February 27 on; these are reported in Table V.a for some of the more severely
affected Department. These are Lodi (LO, total population about 230,000),
Cremona (CR, about 360,000), Piacenza (PC, about 290,000) and Pavia (PV,
about 550,000), and are located (in particular the first three) in a rather homogeneous geographical area. We also consider data for the Departments of
Bergamo (BG, about 1,110,000) and Brescia (BS, about 1,260,000), which lay
more to the North, of Milano (MI, about 3,200,000), and of Padova (PD, about
940,000); the latter includes the red area in Vo’ Euganeo.

We note that while Lodi, Cremona and Pavia (which is however more distant
from the red area) grow at about the same rate, the growth rate in the department of Piacenza – which is contiguous to the Lombardia red area – appears to
be specially high. The same applies to the Bergamo and Brescia. It is possible
that some area in these Departments should better be isolated in the same way
as the red area in Lodi Department, and indeed such measures are presently
under consideration. The impact of the red area in Vo’ Euganeo on the Padova
Department appears to be rather limited, as also implied by its small size. The
growth rate in the Milano area is higher than other ones; this had to be expected
considering that it is related to the population size and density, but for exactly
the same reasons it appears worrying.

Discussion

So far we have only provided raw data; in this short Section we will present some
considerations based on simple models and on projections of he progression of
the epidemic with a reduced speed.4

2.1

Inference from growth rates

The figures given above for the growth rates and daily growth factors in different
areas would allow for an easy estimate of the situation in the next few days
should growth go on at the same rate. However, some restrictive measure and
a campaign of public awareness were started about ten days ago, so – in view
of the COVID-19 incubation time – these should start having some effect any
moment. Comparison with the Korean experience suggest this could lead as far
as halving the growth rate, i.e. doubling the replication time.
In the following Table VI we give the forecast of known infections within one
week (i.e. at March 10) for different areas under different hypotheses for the
reduction of the growth rate5 , i.e. assuming we get a reduced growth rate
α
e = r α0 ,

(4)

with α the present one. In this Table we have considered reductions as drastic
as r = 0.3,but the Korean experience suggests it is difficult to go beyond r =
0.6 − 0.5.

2.2

Suggestions from simple models

Albeit we have not discussed models for the COVID epidemics, and we intend
to present a dedicated model in a companion paper, it may be worth making
some general considerations on the relevance of lowering the parameter α based
on epidemiological models, and in particular on the simple SIR model [7].
4 The computations in this Section are extremely rough, and will be superseeded by the
more adapted model to be discussed in a companion paper; moreover they will appear rather
trivial to reader expert in the field. We will nevertheless present them, as we hope this
document can reach also readers not familiar with epidemic models.
5 As well known, exponential growth can not goon forever; however the numbers are still
(luckily) rather small compared to the overall populations, so this regime should be well
described by an exponential behavior.

11

The SIR model is described by the equations
dS/dt

= − aS I

dI/dt
dR/dt

= aSI − bI
= bI .

Here S represents Susceptible individuals, I the infected ones, and R those
removed from the epidemic dynamics. Note that the total population N =
S + I + R is assumed to remain constant.
It is immediately apparent that in the SIR model the number of infected
will grow as long as
S > Γ := b/a ;
thus Γ is also known as the epidemic threshold. The epidemic can develop only
if the population is above the epidemic threshold.
The parameters a and b describe the contact rate and the removal rate; they
depend both on the characteristics of the pathogen and on social behavior. For
example, a prompt isolation of infected individuals is reflected in raising b, a
reduction of social contacts is reflected in lowering α, and both these actions
raise the epidemic threshold Γ. If this is raised above the level of the total
population N , the epidemic stops (which means the number of infected individuals starts to decrease, albeit new individuals will still be infected). The same
effect can be obtained by reducing the population N , i.e. by partitioning it into
non-communicating compartments, each of them with a population below the
epidemic threshold.6
One can easily obtain the relation between I and S by writing
dI/dS = − 1 +

Γ
,
S

which upon elementary integration yields
I = I0 + (S0 − S) + Γ log(S/S0 ) ;
with I0 , S0 the initial data for I(t) and S(t); in ordinary circumstances, i.e.
unless there are naturally immune individuals, S0 = N − I0 ≃ N .
As we know that the maximum I∗ of I will be reached when S = Γ, we
obtain from this an estimate of this maximum (note that we do not have an
analytical estimate of the time needed to reach this maximum); writing Γ = σN
(with σ < 1) this reads
I∗ = (1 − σ) N − σN log(1/σ) = [1 − σ − σ log(1/σ)] N .

(5)

Thus increasing Γ, even if we do not manage to take it above the population
N , leads to a reduction of the epidemic peak; this reduction can be rather
6 Albeit strictly speaking these predictions only hold within the SIR model, and surely the
exact value of the threshold refers to this model only, the mechanism at play is rather general,
and similar behaviors are met in all kind of epidemic models.

arbitrary units) for different values of the contact rate a; solid: a = a0 , dashed:
a = a0 ∗ 0.8, dotted: a = a0 ∗ 0.7. It is clear how a reduction in the contact rate
produces a substantially more manageable epidemic dynamics, both in terms of
lowering of the epidemic peak and due to a slower dynamics.
relevant also for a relatively moderate reduction of α and thus increase of Γ.
See the example condensed in Table VII.
We stress that a reduction of the parameter a does not only lead to a lowering
of the epidemic peak, but also slows down the whole epidemic dynamics. This
is shown in Figure 8.

Table VII. Exemplification of the effect of reduction of the contact rate a on
the epidemic peak. Here N = 20, 000, 000, b = 1/5 and a0 = (5/3)10−8,
a = ra0 . The values of Γ = b/a and I∗ (Γ) are tabulated for different values of
r ≤ 1 such that the population is still above the epidemic threshold, Γ < N .
We stress that the SIR model is too simple to try to extract from it any
prediction on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemics; a fortiori if with a
naive estimation of the parameters.
However, it points out at the absolute need to reduce the parameter the
contact rate a – which implies reducing the parameter α describing the growth
of the infection – in order to reduce the epidemic peak and to slow down the
epidemic dynamics, getting more time to get prepared to face the epidemic peak.

Conclusions

The spread of COVID-19 epidemics in Northern Italy is well described by an
exponential growth with parameter α ≃ 0.32, with higher values in some regions.
This should be compared with the growth rates in China, and in this sense the
observed figure is quite worrying because:
1. The absolute value of the growth rate is rather large, and very much
similar to the growth rate in the early stage of the epidemics in China
(α = 0.33).
2. The substantial reduction of the growth rate in China was due to rather
strict measures by the central and local Governments. Restrictive measures have also been taken in Italy, but these are substantially weaker than
those adopted in China. As these were implemented around February 24,
their effects will be readable (in view of the rather large incubation time
of COVID) only in the next few days.
3. The experience of Korea – which is in some ways more comparable to
Italy in terms of total population and political decision system – can give
some hint on the expected outcome of not so drastic restrictive measures;
in that case, the α parameter has been nearly halved, and corresponding
the doubling time has doubled itself. This leads – both in Korea and
assuming the same effect is obtained by the Italian restrictive measures
and public awareness – to a slowing down in the epidemic growth, but not
to recovering control over the situation, i.e. taking the dynamics below
the epidemic threshold [7].
4. We expect the growth rate of an epidemic in a given region to be proportional to, and anyway correlated to, its overall population and population
density.In this respect, one should recall that the population of Hubei is
around 60,000,000; on the other hand, the total population of the Italian
regions mainly involved (Lombardia, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna) is about
20,000,000. This means that the virus is circulating at a very high rate,
and social contacts should be substantially reduced in order to have any
hope to stop, or at least substantially slowing down, its spreading.
5. The standard theory of SIR epidemics (not completely adapted to the
present situation) shows that a reduction in the contact rate can lead to a
substantially more manageable development of the epidemics, in particular
postponing the peak period and making it less severe in terms of the
number of cases to be treated simultaneously. One should not forget,
indeed, that albeit COVID is lethal only in a relatively small number of
cases, of the order of 1% (to be however compared with the 10−4 of flu),
this refers to the situation where patients can be properly assisted; as well
known, a saturation of Hospital facilities, or even just of Intensive Care
units, would lead to a dramatic increase of the mortality rate.
