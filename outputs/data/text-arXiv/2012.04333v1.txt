Summary
Progress to-date towards the ambitious global 2030 agenda for sustainable development1,2 has been limited3,
and upheaval from the COVID-19 pandemic will further exacerbate the already significant challenges to
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) achievement4,5. Here, we undertake a model-based global integrated
assessment to characterise alternative pathways towards 36 time-bound, science-driven targets by 2030,
2050, and 2100. We show that it will be unlikely to jointly achieve socioeconomic and environmental targets
by 2030, even under the most optimistic pathways and the least ambitious targets. Nonetheless, humanity
can still avoid destabilisation of the Earth system6 and increase socioeconomic prosperity post-2030 via a
‘Green Recovery’ pathway. A Green Recovery by mid- and end of the century requires reducing global
population by 5% and 26%, empowering sustainable economic development by 32% and 52%, increasing
education availability by 10% and 40%, reducing the total global fossil energy production by 36% and 80%,
reducing agricultural land area by 7% and 10%, and promoting healthy and sustainable lifestyles by
lowering consumption of animal-based foods (i.e., meat and dairy) by 39% and 50%, compared to the
business-as-usual trajectories for 2050 and 2100, respectively. Our results show that the combination of
these changes together towards extended, more ambitious goals by 2050 and 2100 is central to the
transformative change7 needed to ensure that both people and planet prosper in medium- and long-term
futures.

Main text
Progress to-date towards the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)1, which embody the shared
aspirations of humanity to promote societal welfare within the planetary boundaries8, has been very
limited9,10. With less than 10 years to go, much work is still to be done to reach these ambitious global goals.
The global COVID-19 pandemic has also disrupted national social, health, and economic systems, and shortterm recovery efforts will likely dominate the global agenda over the next decade, diverting investment and
distracting nations from the longer-term multi-pronged focus required to meet the SDGs. But failing to
achieve the global sustainability agenda is not an option, and calls have been made to reset it in light of the
pandemic4,5.
A recent evaluation of the Convention of Biological Diversity 2020 Aichi targets has shown that none have
been fully achieved11, which has necessitated rethinking the process, and a new round of revision and targetsetting12. To avoid a similar outcome for the SDGs and subsequent loss of momentum in progress towards
global sustainability, it is prudent to explore alternate pathways towards increasingly ambitious mediumand long-term goals to enable missed 2030 targets to be met later on, to ensure that earlier achievements are
not lost through complacency, and to establish a long-term process of continuous improvement. Here, we
use integrated assessment modelling to assess the performance of alternative pathways towards 36
sustainability targets under eight SDGs by 2030 (short-term) and their extensions to 2050 (medium-term)
and 2100 (long-term) with increasing levels of ambition. Given current and future socioeconomic and
environmental uncertainties, this assessment is timely to illuminate robust options for humanity to achieve
global sustainability aspirations over the course of the 21st century, even if we fail to fully achieve the United
Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda.
The scientific community has attempted to inform policy discussion on the SDGs with model-based scenario
assessments, but mostly with a focus on specific sectors such as land13, food14,15, energy16,17, and biodiversity
conservation18 with a few notable exceptions of global nexus-type assessments such as food-energy-water19,
land-food20, and land-food-biodiversity21. The few, more comprehensive, integrated assessments of global
sustainability that do exist have either used relatively simple models that do not capture the interactions of
complex systems22, or have not assessed progress towards explicit targets consistent with the SDGs23. This
has impeded a comprehensive understanding of progress under the uncertainty of global change and
precluded a detailed characterisation of the transformative change needed to reach the sustainability targets,
especially over timeframes extending well beyond 2030.
We used the Functional Enviro-economic Linkages Integrated neXus (FeliX) model17, a global integrated
assessment model based on system dynamics24, to evaluate how interlinked future drivers might unfold
through the nexus of population, education, economy, energy, land, food, biodiversity, and climate systems
(Extended Data Figure 1). We explored a set of five internally consistent descriptions of future pathways
aligned with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) scenarios25,26 which span a range of possibilities
from continuation of current trends (business-as-usual) to implementation of very strong sustainability
3

interventions across the economic, education, food, and energy sectors (Extended Data Table 1 and
Methods).
Our SSP-compliant pathways include ‘Green Recovery’ representing inclusive socioeconomic and
environmental development (SSP1), ‘Business As Usual’ as the continuation of current global average
trajectories (SSP2), ‘Fragmented World’ characterised by regional rivalry rather than global cooperation
(SSP3), a world of high ‘Inequality’ in human and economic opportunities (SSP4), and ‘Fossil-Fuelled
Development’ with prospering socioeconomic yet unsustainable environmental outlook (SSP5). Green
Recovery and Fragmented World are indicative of an optimistic and pessimistic post-pandemic future. The
former represents ‘a new world of opportunities’ where the world shows solidarity in a long-term,
sustainable recovery from COVID-19 and emerges fairer, more inclusive, and more prosperous than before.
The latter represents increasingly nationalistic attitudes amplifying perceived threats, failures, and a limited
capacity to build resilience for coping with future global shocks. Given the deep uncertainties inherent in
the characterisation of these five pathways, we used an exploratory ensemble modelling approach27,28
(50,000 model evaluations) to obtain more robust insights from many possible realisations of each pathway
under socioeconomic and environmental uncertainties (Methods and Extended Data Figure 2). The
characterisation of the five pathways and their associated realisations (Extended Data Figure 4 and
Supplementary Figure 6) represents fundamentally different futures for human societies and facilitates the
impact assessment of possible strategies towards the SDG agenda.
We selected 36 indicators within the scope of the model (Methods and Extended Data Figure 3) to evaluate
eight sustainable development goals related to food and agriculture (SDG 2), health and well-being (SDG
3), quality education (SDG 4), clean energy (SDG 7), sustainable economic growth (SDG 8), climate action
(SDG 13), and biodiversity conservation (SDG 15). We specified weak, moderate, and ambitious targets
(Extended Data Figure 2 and Extended Data Table 2) for 2030, then increased the ambition and extended
the timeframe of the targets to 2050 (consistent with the Paris Agreement timeframe29) and to 2100 (aligning
with the IPCC assessment timeframe30).
Joint target achievement requires a new post-2030 timeframe. By 2030, across all pathways combined
(stacked bar charts in Figure 1a), the world is on track (in >50% of 50,000 realisations) for only 5 out of the
36 moderate targets, mostly related to socioeconomic SDGs. Worse, the world is stagnating or even
regressing compared to the 2015 state of the world (in >80% of 50,000 realisations) for more than twothirds of the 36 moderate targets, mostly related to environmental SDGs.
To illustrate, for the 2030 moderate targets, quality education (SDG 4), economic growth (SDG 8), and
health and wellbeing (SDG 3) have a progress of 85%, 78%, and 59%, respectively (Figure 2). FossilFuelled Development and Green Recovery have the fastest progress to these goals. In at least 50% of
realisations of each of these two pathways, moderate targets under SDGs 3, 4, and 8 are either on track (five
targets) or improving (three targets) by 2030 (pie charts in Figure 1a). A combination of assumptions on
accelerated human capital investment and low population growth (Supplementary Figure 6c-i, c-v and
4

Extended Data Figure 4a-i, a-v) makes Fossil-Fuelled Development and Green Recovery on track towards
these targets by 2030. Among the modelled pathways, Fragmented World (and then Business As Usual and
Inequality) have the slowest progress by 2030, stagnating (four targets) and even deteriorating from the
2015 state of the world (one target) for most moderate socioeconomic targets under SDGs 3, 4, and 8.

Figure 1. Projected progress towards the ‘moderate’ SDG targets by 2030 (a), 2050 (b), and 2100 (c) under five modelled
pathways. Progress levels are coloured coded and defined according to Methods. The stacked bar charts represent the progress
across 50,000 realisations of all future pathways combined. The highest percentage of the realisations at each progress level is
indicated inside the bars. The arrows show the progress of the greatest number of realisations per each pathway. See Supplementary
Figure 7 for progress towards ‘weak’ and ‘ambitious’ SDG targets.

Sustainable food (SDG 2) and clean energy (SDG 7) are the two goals with slower progress of 46% and
28% respectively (Figure 2). In SDG 2, Fossil-Fuelled Development outperforms other pathways by 74%
progress with on track or improving trends towards six out of seven moderate 2030 targets on food
production and agricultural productivity (Figure 1a). On the other hand, Fragmented World’s progress is
only 36%, being on track in achieving only two food-related targets by 2030. For SDG 7, the sustainable
economic development in Green Recovery leads to progress of 47% towards targets, mostly due to achieving
economic growth with a higher adoption of efficient end-use technologies and a faster transition to
renewable energy (Extended Data Figure 4c-i). However, Fossil-Fuelled Development and Fragmented
World have the slowest progress and are on track in only one targets for clean energy (respectively) due to

5

heavy reliance on fossil energy (oil, gas, and then coal) production throughout the century (Supplementary
Figure 6e-v, f-v, g-v).
Inadequate progress by 2030 can be even worse with ≤0%, 5%, and 1% progress in biodiversity conservation
(SDG 15), responsible production (SDG 11), and climate action (SDG 13), respectively. Projected progress
in almost all 13 targets under these SDGs are either stagnating or deteriorating across the five modelled
pathways by 2030. Poor environmental performance in all pathways except Green Recovery is largely the
result of increasing demand for food production31, high meat consumption, and a growing energy-intensive
economy which poses risks for environmental targets such as agricultural land expansion and intensive
nitrogen fertiliser use (Extended Data Figure 4). The lowest achievements on these targets also translate into
major consequences for ecosystem loss such as rapid decline in forest lands (in all pathways, 100% of
realisations) and for destructive climate impacts such as faster global temperature increase (in all pathways,
99% of realisations), as raised in previous studies21,32,33 (Figure 1a).

Figure 2. Global progress towards achieving eight sustainable development goals. Each panel shows the progress towards one
SDG. In each plot, the three bars indicate progress towards 2030, 2050, and 2100 targets. The bar indicates progress towards the
moderate target and the error bar is the variation between progress towards ambitious (error bar bottom) and weak (error bar top)
targets in across 50,000 simulated realisations of all future pathways combined. The annotated percentages are average progress
across all pathways combined (grey text), the progress in the pathway with the worst performance (red text), and the progress in the
pathway with the best performance (blue text), all percentages towards moderate targets by 2030, 2050, and 2100. The pie charts
show the share of simulated realisations per each pathway (P1: Green Recovery, P2: Business As Usual, P3: Fragmented World,
P4: Inequality, P5: Fossil-Fuelled Development). The pie chart colours show different progress levels (green: on track, yellow:
improving, orange: stagnating, red: wrong direction) towards the moderate targets by 2100.

Overall, although individual target achievement varies between pathways and is sensitive to the uncertainty
across different world realisations (Methods), the current UN agenda for sustainable development remains
largely unmet by 2030, even in the most optimistic pathways (e.g., Green Recovery). This reflects tensions
between socioeconomic and environmental goals20,34 which lead to failure in concurrently achieving the
2030 targets.

Exploring pathways to reaching 2050 and 2100 targets. The short timeframe can have a complex effect
on slow progress towards and tensions between the SDGs by 2030, and there is a higher chance of achieving
more ambitious targets by 2050 and 2100. Looking at progress over the century (Figures 1 and 2), some
SDGs such as biodiversity conservation and climate action could reverse their unsustainable trajectories in
a post-2030 timeframe via immediate adoption of Green Recovery. Owing to investment in high-quality
and well-functioning education (Supplementary Figure 6a-i, b-i, c-i) and a declining population growth
(Extended Data Figure 4a-i), the trends under the Green Recovery pathway can achieve a high level of
socioeconomic prosperity (Extended Data Figure 5b-i to b-iii; c-i to c-iii), but also with promising
improvements to the major energy, climate, and ecological targets by 2050 and 2100. The Green Recovery
pathway performs very well in the medium-term, with 42%, 54%, and 74% progress in biodiversity
conservation, responsible production, and climate action by 2050, respectively (Figure 2). This means being
on track or improving for 9 out of 13 targets by 2050 (compared to only one improving target by 2030) even
with a higher level of target ambition (Figure 1a).
With a longer timeframe and even more ambitious targets, Green Recovery’s progress in biodiversity
conservation, responsible production, and climate action will become greater by 2100 (90%, 94%, and 84%
respectively), being on track or improving on 12 out 13 targets (Figure 1a). The cumulative effect of
interventions (e.g., low carbon energy system, healthy diet with reduced meat consumption) incorporated
in the Green Recovery pathway creates these promising long-term trajectories towards targets, which is
central to turning the ‘tide of change’7 post-2030 to higher achievements.
While the improvement in SDG achievement over the century is substantial in Green Recovery, this is not
the case for other pathways where the environmental SDGs (i.e., 7, 12, 13, 15) remain largely unmet by
2050 and 2100. For example, the Fossil-Fuelled Development pathway results in the most rapid
improvement in socioeconomic indicators, such as Gross World Product (GWP) per capita (Extended Data
Figure 5e-i), achieving moderate (and sometimes even ambitious) targets by 2100. However, human and
economic prosperity in Fossil-Fuelled Development also leads to the rapid growth in the share of fossil fuels
in energy supply (Extended Data Figure 5d-v, d-vi) driven by increasing energy demand from high energy
intensity of the industry and services (Supplementary Figure 6d-v). The reliance on fossil fuels translates
into high climate impacts from energy-related CO2 emissions (Extended Data Figure 5g-iii) by 2100 in
almost all 10,000 realisations of the Fossil-Fuelled Development pathway. This jeopardises the achievement
of even the weakest targets set for climate indicators by the IPCC35 in 2030 and beyond. Longer term target
achievement is also challenged in Business As Usual, Fragmented World, and Inequality, where they fail to
meet even the weakest socioeconomic, energy, climate, and ecological targets in most of pathway
realisations.
Priorities for transformative change in a new post-2030 agenda. Humanity is at a crossroads in planning
for a post-pandemic world. Our projections of progress towards the SDGs showed that the 2030 agenda
faces significant challenges limiting the chances of near-term success. Based on this evidence, we call for
7

extending the current UN Agenda 2030’s timeframe, with increasing levels of ambition in targets over the
course of the century. This maintains the imperative for and global focus on sustainable development5 over
the long-term with a more radical approach18,21 that disrupts the status quo, accelerates actions for achieving
the SDGs, and puts a safety net in place where achieving ambitious long-term sustainability aspirations are
not threatened by a failure to achieve some short-term goals.

Figure 3. Socioeconomic and environmental transformative change needed in realising pathways to Green Recovery. The
envelops show one standard deviation bandwidth in the results and the middle line is the mean. The arrows represent the change
percentage needed to deviate from the mean of the business-as-usual envelop to the mean of the Green Recovery envelope in 2030,
2050, and 2100. The mean estimate percentage of improvement reported in the text and annotated is the distance between the mean
value of the envelopes in 2030, 2050, and 2100. The confidence range reported in the text is the minimum and maximum distance
between the upper-bound and lower-bound (one standard deviation) of the two envelopes in 2030, 2050, and 2100.

We showed (in Figures 1 and 2) that the Green Recovery pathway, over the medium- to long-term, can be
a way forward for realising co-benefits between multiple goals36. As a step towards developing a more
effective approach, we characterise the major transformative change needed across multiple sectors by
analysing the distance to be bridged from current business-as-usual trajectories to the trajectories of a Green
Recovery in a post-2030 timeframe (Figure 3 and Methods).
Compared to 2050 and 2100 business-as-usual, a Green Recovery primarily requires slowing population
growth by 5% and 26%, along with a modest yet sustainable economic growth of 32% and 52%, and
improving access to education by 10% and 40%, respectively. The demographic transition to a lower but
more highly educated and prosperous population can lead to poverty reduction and gender equality. Higher
educational levels also correlate with social norms and people’s beliefs in the adoption of bolder actions
such as improved family planning37, consuming less meat15 and the appropriate attribution of extreme events
to climate change38,39 to lower population, avoid further deforestation, and reduce GHG emissions,
respectively. Concurrently achieving these long-term targets and goals strongly relies on harnessing
synergies and minimising trade-offs through steady progress across key parameters such as education level.
These socioeconomic changes, however, need to be further supported by transformations in the current
consumption and production practices in energy, land, and food systems to mitigate some of the currently
alarming trends of emissions and increasing temperature16,40. Our energy systems need to be decarbonised
8

more rapidly compared to business-as-usual trajectories with a decline of at least 36% and 80% in fossil
energy (i.e., coal, oil, gas) production by 2050 and 2100, respectively. This also needs to be coupled with
changing the patterns of energy consumption through a transition to 13% and 32% lower energy intensity
services (compared to the business-as-usual) by mid and end of the century.
Cropland and pasture land need to be reduced by 7% and 10% compared to business-as-usual by 2050 and
2100 while continuing to increase food production. This requires improvement in crops and livestock yields
and reducing food waste along with strong regulations on land-use change to limit deforestation and reverse
the currently alarming trends of biodiversity loss21. These changes in the land sector should be facilitated
by and intertwined with collaborative actions on food choices15 through 39% and 50% reduction in landbased animal (i.e., meat and dairy) caloric intake in a healthy diet and a drop of 49% and 67% in livestock
production by 2050 and 2100, respectively (compared to business-as-usual). This can also help those worst
affected by the distributional impacts on food supply chains in a post-pandemic world.
While realising such transformative changes may come across as wishful thinking given current trends and
the myriad of technical and political challenges that beset it, a pathway to Green Recovery is not totally out
of reach. There are currently promising endeavours across several key sectors that could pave the way for
transition to Green Recovery. Universal education is projected to be nearly achieved in many developed and
developing countries, with supporting measures such as eliminating school fees and improving local access
to schools to ensure equality41. In energy sector, there is already diverse global support for reducing energy
intensity through digitalisation to transform energy efficiency and increase its value42. Reduction in energy
demand in various countries is also complemented by policies such as carbon pricing for GHG emissions to
accelerate the decarbonisation process17,40. Coordinated efforts in food and land sectors have also emerged
to promote healthy diet and sustainable agriculture through strategies such as investment in public health
information and intensifying food production of high-quality outcomes33,43.
The global community needs to take additional steps to capitalise on these efforts in revising and extending
the SDGs as an internationally agreed framework that works at the global, national, and local scale44 and
that can unite all sectors and countries behind a resilient economy and build coherent policies for a healthy
planet. A Green Recovery pathway can create a touchpoint for science and policy discussions about resetting
the global sustainability agenda of the 21st century in the light of sustainable futures that is central for
recovering from the pandemic with a better future for people and planet.

Methods
The FeliX model
FeliX is a system dynamics model that simulates complex interactions amongst ten sectors: population,
education, economy, energy, water, land, food and diet change, carbon cycle, climate, and biodiversity. The
model captures the underpinning feedback mechanisms of physical and anthropogenic change between these
sectors as described in Supplementary Methods 1. FeliX has been used previously for exploring global
energy and land-use emissions pathways17, exploring the impacts of dietary changes on the food system15,
and evaluating socio-environmental impacts in the Earth observation systems45. The model is calibrated
with historical data46 from 1900 to 2015. The model projects the global average of future socioeconomic
and environmental developments over the long-term to 2100.
We enhanced the latest version of FeliX15 by implementing global change pathways based on the Shared
Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) scenarios25,26 and operationalising SDG indicators and targets in the
model, closely related to the UN 2030 Agenda. A summary of the sectoral modules in FeliX is available in
Extended Data Figure 1 and a detailed description is available in Supplementary Methods 1, in the original
FeliX documentation46, and in previous papers15,17. The model and its supporting data are publicly available
online (Data and Code Availability).
Pathway construction
We constructed five pathways consistent with the combinations of SSPs25,26 and the Representative
Concentration Pathways (RCPs)47,48 scenarios. The SSPs and RCPs together represent the interactions of
five socio-economic futures with different levels of global radiative forcing from 1.9 W m-2 to 8.5 W m-2.
Our constructed pathways represent plausible societal, technical, cultural, economic, and climatic
developments playing out over the course of the 21st century. Given the deep uncertainties inherent to the
characterisation of these pathways, we simulated 10,000 realisations of each pathway (50,000 total), with
each realisation representing how the pathway could unfold under one possible state of the world (Extended
Data Figure 2). Pathway construction was performed in three steps:
1. Construct pathway narratives: We first elaborated a set of internally consistent and coherent narratives
about the five pathways aligned with the assumptions under five SSP-RCP combinations from the Coupled
Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIP6)49 to describe what the different futures could look like. This
guided the selection of pathway drivers and their quantification (explained in the next two steps). We
developed the pathway narrative for ‘Green Recovery’ consistent with SSP1-RCP2.6 — an indicative
scenario for low-range greenhouse gas emissions — which had the highest potential for climate change
mitigation facilitated by technology advances and strong measures for emissions reduction from the energy
and land sectors. The narrative for ‘Business As Usual’ and ‘Inequality’ — two pathways with moderate
mitigation challenges — was consistent with SSP2-RCP4.5 and SSP4-RCP6.0, respectively. We developed
the narratives of ‘Fragmented World’ and ‘Fossil-Fuelled Development’ — indicative scenarios for high13

range emissions both with significant challenges to mitigation and weak measures for emissions reductions
from energy and land sectors — consistent with SSP3-RCP7.0 and SSP5-RCP8.5, respectively.
Note that we aligned our pathways only with these five specific SSP-RCP combinations. We acknowledge
that there were other potential combinations assessed in other studies50 that we did not investigate here. For
example in Green Recovery, we aligned the pathway with SSP1-RCP2.6 as the most common level of
radiative forcing for SSP1 across 715 SSP-related studies50. However, Green Recovery could be also
constructed inline with the pathways of more aggressive actions (e.g., EU, China, or the US pledges to
comply with the Paris agreement) or more extreme mitigation (e.g., RCP1.9 or pathways proposed by the
IPCC 1.551). This could make Green Recovery attain higher environmental achievements (e.g., faster
reduction of fossil energy supply and emissions) compared to our study.
To construct the pathway narratives under the five SSP-RCP combinations, we elaborated on the qualitative
assumptions of the original SSP storylines25 and their sectoral extensions26,52-55. We also made assumptions
describing the policy environment in both the near and long-term for climate mitigation to meet radiative
forcing levels associated with each SSP. We made assumptions with respect to mitigating emissions from
fossil fuels, bioenergy, and land via, for example, implementing carbon capture and storage for fossil fuels
and bioenergy (BECCS) and imposing carbon price on fossil fuels. There was one set of policy assumptions
associated with each pathway narrative, consistent with its inherent challenges for mitigation as outlined in
Supplementary Table 1. Qualitative assumptions involved the descriptions of trends spanning
socioeconomic (population56, education56, economy57,58), energy and climate25,54 (demand, market share,
technology advances, resources, production cost, and environmental concerns), land (land-use change25,55,59,
(land) productivity25,55), food and diet (waste, consumption, and diet change15), and climate mitigation
policy dimensions. The details of all narratives (qualitative assumptions) are available in Supplementary
Table 1.
2. Identify pathway drivers in FeliX: To quantify the socioeconomic and environmental trends of each
pathway narrative, we needed to identify those model parameters (i.e., pathway drivers) that are key in the
projection of these trends. To identify pathway drivers from an initial list of 114 model parameters (as
potential drivers) (Supplementary Table 2), we performed a series of global sensitivity analyses to prioritise
the model parameters based on their influence on key model outputs or control variables (Supplementary
Table 3) whose trends were described qualitatively in the narratives (Supplementary Table 1). From several
candidate global sensitivity analysis techniques60, we adopted Morris elementary effects method and
sensitivity index μ*61,62 due to its ability to efficiently and effectively screen and identify benign parameters
(i.e., factor fixing) from a large number of inputs in complex models62,63. To compute μ*, we used the SALib
library64 implementation through the EMA workbench65 in the Python environment. We analysed the
convergence of μ* for each control variable across different experiment sizes over time (by 2030, 2050, and
2100) to ensure the reliability of the ranking results (Supplementary Figure 1). The sensitivity analysis

14

process resulted in the ranking of model parameters across control variables based on a total of 1,610,000
model evaluations (Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 3).
From the sensitivity ranking of 114 model parameters, we identified as pathway drivers those important
parameters that captured most of the variance in SSP projections as reflected by the control variables. The
Morris method however, does not provide a cut-off value on the sensitivity index to limit the ranking results
to a subset of important parameters. Instead, we identified the number of influential parameters from the
ranking by systematically evaluating the consequences of selecting various combinations of the top ranked
parameters across the control variables. To ensure that no significant model interactions were lost by
selecting a subset from the top ranked parameters, we ran two sets of Latin Hypercube Sampling
experiments. In the first set of experiments, we ran FeliX many times varying only a subset of top ranked
parameters, and in the second set of experiments varying all parameters, checking the degree of correlation
across control variables produced by the two sets66. This resulted in the identification of 60 influential
parameters which we used as pathway drivers in FeliX (Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Table
4). The selected influential parameters were our pathway drivers which were annotated in Supplementary
Figure 2. Details of the implementation are available in Supplementary Methods 2 and Supplementary
Figure 4.
3. Calibrate FeliX under the pathway narratives: To define SSP-compliant pathways, we calibrated the
identified drivers in FeliX under the assumptions of the SSPs and our pathways narratives (instead of using
predetermined GDP and population projections as the model inputs) and also aligned with the projected
radiative forcing levels with the respective RCPs. Fundamental socioeconomic drivers of pathways 25 were
calibrated based on quantitative projections of population56, economic growth57, and educational
attainment56 using formal demographic and economic models (Supplementary Figure 5). We used the
Powell algorithm67) with a payoff (i.e., objective) function in Vensim to optimise pathway drivers so as to
match projections of population, economic growth, and educational attainment of the formal demographic
and economic models under each SSP. The payoff was defined as the weighted difference between the
model output variable (𝑣𝑀 ) and the quantitative SSP estimate for the same output variable (𝑣𝐷 ) at each time
step 𝑡 (∀𝑡 ∈ 𝑇) under each SSP (∀𝑠 ∈ 𝑆). For each output variable 𝑣, a weighting factor 𝑤 (∀𝑤 ∈ 𝑊 ) was
used to normalise the influence of model parameters with different units. The payoff function 𝐹 was then
computed following Equation 1.
2100

𝑠
𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝐹 (𝑝𝑖 ) = − ∫𝑡=2020(∑𝑣∈𝑉(𝑤𝑣𝑠 (𝑡) × (𝑣𝑀
(𝑡) − 𝑣𝐷𝑠 (𝑡))2 )𝑑𝑡

Equation 1

Subject to:
𝑝𝑖 ∈ 𝕌 (∀𝑝 ∈ 𝑃, ∀𝑖 ∈ 𝐼)
Where 𝑃, 𝐼, and 𝕌 denote socioeconomic drivers (related to population, economy, and education), the index
of the driver, and the variation space of drivers for calibration, respectively. The calibration of FeliX’s
socioeconomic drivers under each SSP involved 1000 iterations with 5 starts where the search is restarted
15

from a different initialisation to avoid local minima, such that the maximum simulations per pathway
calibration is 5000. To calibrate pathway drivers related to energy and climate, land-use, and food and diet,
we varied the default (business-as-usual) values in line with the SSP narratives and the associated RCP
radiative forcing levels. Supplementary Table 4 includes the detailed quantitative model parameter
definitions, units, and assumptions and Supplementary Methods 2 has more details on the calibration
process.
4. Project pathways and validate with other IAM projections: Using the calibrated pathway drivers, we
projected future developments in population, education, economy, energy, land, food, and climate and
checked these against projections of the same sectors by other research organisations56,57,59,68 and integrated
assessment models23,52,53,69,70 as reported in the original SSP Database71. Given the uncertainties inherent in
the calibration of the pathway drivers, we considered parametric uncertainty in the calibrated value of the
drivers and compared projected envelopes (rather than single indicative lines) with other IAMs. To create
envelopes of plausible projections for each pathway, we used Latin Hypercube Sampling to randomly
sample from the parameter uncertainty space of all drivers, creating 10,000 realisations (model projections)
for each of five pathways. Extended Data Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 6 characterise our modelled
pathways and compare them against the projections of other IAMs.
SDG implementation
The SDG framework includes 17 goals and 231 unique indicators to measure progress towards 169 targets.
Here we explain how we operationalised the SDGs in FeliX via selecting and modelling a subset of
indicators, setting science-based targets on the selected indicators, and measuring progress towards targets
at the indicator and goal level (Extended Data Figure 3).
1. Model SDG indictors in FeliX: We selected a list of 36 SDG indicators from the United Nations Statistical
Commission (UNSC)72 and other sources (e.g., OECD73, WHO74, FAO75, World Bank76) based on three
criteria. First, we looked at the global relevance of the potential output indicators generated by FeliX for
measuring SDG progress (SDG applicability). Second, we assessed the ability of FeliX to quantify the SDG
indicator (model fidelity). For those indicators that were not present in FeliX, we chose proxies. For
example, we did not include an official indicator for biodiversity conservation such as the Red List Index
as the required data is not produced in FeliX. Instead, we presented mean species abundance as a proxy
indicator for biodiversity21. Third, we ensured that the selected indicators are amenable to the specification
of quantitative performance thresholds for measuring progress towards the SDGs (target relevancy). We did
not include the indicators that FeliX could project such as ‘male or female population’ which could not be
meaningfully interpreted in terms of progress towards the SDGs. All indicators from the global SDG
indicator framework72 that passed these three criteria were implemented in the model (Extended Data Figure
3). Information on the methodology for computing indicator values in the model is available in
Supplementary Equations 1 to 36.

16

2. Set time-bound, science-driven targets for modelled indicators: The successful evaluation of progress
towards the SDGs required a science-driven characterisation of targets77 and a quantification of progress
that can guide effective policy-making32. We defined nine different targets for each indicator using a mixed
method approach to acknowledge the uncertainty around each target and the high sensitivity of SDG
assessment to target specification. First, we set three target levels across the selected indicators: weak,
moderate, and ambitious. At each level, we also set three time-bound targets to measure the progress by
2030, 2050, and 2100. We defined the ambitious target level across these target years following a decision
tree3,78 (Extended Data Figure 3).
First, we used available quantitative thresholds that were explicitly reflected in the official SDG framework
(SDG absolute threshold) to set targets (3 indicators). For example, SDG 8 indicates “at least 7 per cent
GDP growth” which can translate into a specific target for the growth rate of ‘GDP per capita’ indicator.
Second, if an explicit target was not mentioned in the SDG framework, we used a technical optimum to set
targets (27 indicators). We used targets, wherever relevant, that were identified in other scientific journal
articles21,23,47,79-82, global reports3,51,83, and online databases71-73,76,84,85. For example, we used the IPCC’s
levels of radiative forcing for keeping the global temperature below 1.5 degree °C as target levels for the
‘radiative forcing’ indicator. The sources used for setting the technical optimum targets along with the
justification for the value each target are available in Supplementary Table 5.
Third, wherever the SDG absolute threshold and technical optimum were not applicable, we followed the
2030 agenda’s principle of “leave no one behind” and set the targets based on the average state of the top
performing countries in a base year using historical documented data (5 indicators). Here, the global average
as calculated by FeliX is expected to reach the levels of current top performing countries. In selecting the
top performing countries, we removed the outliers from the list to reduce bias in our calculation. For
example, a small country with limited agricultural arable land can have very low levels of fertilizer
application. Therefore, the inclusion of this country as a top performer in calculating the target for the ‘food
and agriculture phosphorous balance’ indicator can be misleading for larger countries with larger
contribution to global food production. Where performance data was not available at the country level, we
used regional data (e.g., OECD, continents).
Fourth, in the absence of any relevant targets, we nominally set a proportional improvement target in the
indicator value from the world average in a base year guided by historical data (global improvement) (1
indicator). For example, ‘total CO2 emissions from agriculture’ is an indicator with no absolute threshold
mentioned in the original SDGs or technical optimum in other studies. The value of this indicator is also
sensitive to the size of a country’s agricultural sector. Therefore, leaving no one behind and the average of
the top performers did not lead to a meaningful target. In this case, we used a level of global improvement
as a target for the indicator. The base year for improvement can vary between indicators depending on the
availability of data. The decision about the improvement rate from the base year value was made on a caseby-case basis for each indicator in a range between 5% improvement (e.g., in reducing CO2 emissions from
17

land-use) to 50% improvement (e.g., reducing coal production) from the global average as the 2030
ambitious target. The reduction or increase percentage was also informed by other model-based projections
of SSPs to set an improvement rate ambitious enough to surpass the current trends while still being
achievable.
For the moderate and weak target levels (across all three target years), we assumed that the moderate and
weak indicate 50% and 25% progress towards the ambitious target from the base year value in 2015 with
the exception of indicators for which moderate and weak targets were already available in the literature
(e.g., radiative forcing from CO2 emissions). Extended Data Table 2 presents the target values at weak,
moderate, and ambitious levels, in 2030, 2050, and 2100 for all modelled indicators, and Supplementary
Table 5 explains the justifications of the set targets.
3. Measure progress towards targets: We normalised indicator with different scales and units of
measurement to ensure comparability and consistent interpretation. For each target level (i.e., weak,
moderate, ambitious) and at each target year (i.e., 2030, 2050, 2100), we normalised indicator values to
represent performance against target achievement, ranging between the 0% (no progress or divergence away
from targets) and 100% (meeting or exceeding targets). The higher values denote a better performance and
the gap from 100 indicates the distance that needs to be taken to achieve the target. The scores below 0 and
above 100 were interpreted as where the world is deteriorating from the status quo, and exceeding target
levels, respectively. The indicator values were normalised based on the rescaling formula in Equation 2.
𝐼𝑖𝑗(𝑥𝑖 , 𝑤𝑖 , 𝑡𝑖 ) =

𝑥𝑖 − 𝑤𝑖
× 100
𝑡𝑖 − 𝑤𝑖

Equation 2

Where 𝐼𝑖𝑗 is the computed normalised value of indicator 𝑖 under goal 𝑗, 𝑥𝑖 is the model estimate of indicator
𝑖 in a single projection, 𝑤𝑖 is the base year (FeliX) value in 2015, and 𝑡𝑖 is the indicator target level for a
certain year (see Data and Code Availability). We then aggregated the normalised indicator values into an
index score to represent global progress towards each SDG (Equation 3).
𝑁𝑗

𝐼 ′𝑗 (𝑁𝑗 , 𝐼𝑖𝑗 ) = ∑
𝑖=1

𝐼𝑖𝑗
𝑁𝑗

Equation 3

Where 𝐼 ′𝑗 is the SDG 𝑗 and 𝑁𝑗 is the number of modelled indicators under goal 𝑗. The index and its
methodology were adopted from a similar index used in the global monitoring of the SDG progress 3. We
used the arithmetic mean with a normative assumption of equal weight across each goal’s indicators to align
with the global efforts to treat all indicators equally and only prioritise indicators when progress is lagging.
This also assumes that there is unlikely to be a consensus on SDG indicator priorities78. Based on the
normalised values at the indicator level and aggregated indices at the goal level, we measured world progress
towards targets at four levels. On track indicates that progress highly likely to achieve (or exceed) global
sustainability targets (i.e., indicator and goal level target achievement ≥100%). Improving indicates positive
18

trends towards the goal and indicator level targets but meeting them is unlikely, so challenges remain (i.e.,
target achievement between 50 and 100%). Stagnating indicates performance following current trends, little
chance of target achievement, and significant challenges remain (i.e., target achievement between 0 and
50%). Wrong direction indicates a deteriorating trend (i.e., target achievement between ≤0%).
Pathway-SDG evaluation
We evaluated the five pathways in terms of the modelled indicators and progress towards the SDG targets
through exploratory ensemble modelling28,86. In evaluating pathways across the SDGs, we simulated 50,000
world realisations (10,000 model evaluations per pathway) to capture plausible progress in response to the
uncertainty in the characterisation of pathways and the sensitivity of progress to the number of indicators
and target levels. We then interpreted each pathway’s performance under uncertainty in terms of percentage
of simulated realisations.
Our evaluation had four steps. First, we initially looked at the performance of simulated pathways towards
the targets at the indicator level over time (Extended Data Figure 5) to investigate the ambition and
achievability of targets. Here, we analysed the projected value of modelled indicators, in their real units of
measurement, under each simulated pathway (and its realisations) in relation to targets at three timesteps
(i.e., 2030, 2050, 2100). Second, we analysed the normative value of the projected indicators (in 2030, 2050,
and 2100) under each modelled pathway to measure and compare the progress across all targets consistently
with a single unit (i.e., percentage of gap from target) (Figure 1). Third, we aggregated the indicators’
normalised values towards targets and measured the overall progress under each pathway at the goal level
to account for possible synergies and trade-offs between the multiple modelled targets under each SDG
(Figure 2). Fourth, from the comparison of pathway’s performance across goals and targets and over time,
we identified the most promising pathway (i.e., Green Recovery) in the 21st century. We then characterised
this identified pathway across multiple sectors (e.g., population, education, decarbonisation, food) and
quantified the steps to be taken from the business-as-usual trajectories to realise the identified pathway
(Figure 3).

Extended Data Table 1. Descriptions of modelled pathway drivers in FeliX. In the first column, pathway drivers (e.g.,
population growth) are categorised into socioeconomic, energy and climate, land, and food and diet change in relation to their
impacts on different SDGs. Each pathway driver is associated with a number of model parameters in FeliX. The fraction value in
front each pathway driver in the first column shows the number of influential model parameters (that were identified through
sensitivity analysis) to the total number of parameters modelled in FeliX. For example, we modelled ‘economic growth’ through
five uncertain parameters two of which were identified as influential to be included in the quantification of pathways. From the
second to the sixth column, the triangles qualitatively represent the direction and magnitude of change in the calibrated pathway
drivers. The signs  represents a strong increase,  increase,  no change from business-as-usual,  is decrease, and  is strong
decrease. The last column shows the effect of each driver on the related SDGs. ‘P’ and ‘D’ indicate that the increasing driver has
pressurising (i.e., creating barriers) and depressurising (i.e., facilitating) effects on related SDGs respectively. See Supplementary
Table 4 for the full list of parameters and their calibrated values in FeliX.

Pathway construction
Construct pathway narratives
•Develop 5 qualitative assumptions
for socioeconomic and
environmental drivers aligned with
five SSP-RCP combinations.
Identify pathway drivers
•Identify 60 important model
parameters (i.e., pathway drivers)
in FeliX for the narratives through
global sensitivity analysis.
Calibrate pathway drivers
•Calibrate FeliX’s socioeconomic,
energy and climate, land-use, and
food and diet scenario drivers under
the assumptions of five pathway
(SSP-RCP) narratives.
Validate simulated pathways
•Validate the simulated pathway
projections with the SSP-RCP
projections of other IAMs across
20 control variables.

SDG implementation
Model SDG indictors
•Model 36 SDG indicators across 8
SDGs in FeliX within the model
scope.

Set targets on indicators
•Identify 9 target values (3 target
levels x 3 target years) for each
indicator based on original SDG
framework, science-based metrics,
the ‘leave no one behind’ principle.
Measure progress (indicator level)
•Normalise the indicators’ projections
and targets between 0% and 100%
and computing the distance taken
from 2015 and the gap to achieve
the targets.
Measure progress (goal level)
•Aggregate the normalised values of
indicators into a SDG index and
measuring the progress at the goal
level between 0% and 100%.

Pathway-SDG evaluation
Explore pathway x SDG interactions
under uncertainty
•Evaluate 50,000 realisations of pathways
with respect to the targets for each indicator
and aggregated in each SDG.
•Assessing comparative performance of
pathways in meeting the targets under
uncertainty.

Elaborate the change need to
achieve the post-2030 SDGs
•Characterise the post-2030 transformative
change based on the deviation of the best
performing pathway from business-as-usual.

Extended Data Figure 5. Performance of global pathways towards SDG targets in 2100 under five SSP-compliant pathways.
Results for the performance of each pathway are represented by a specifically colour coded violin plot and boxplot. The violin
shows the distribution of pathway’s performance across 10,000 simulated realisations of each pathway. The box shows the interquartile range (centre line is median) of these simulated realisations while the whiskers extend to show the rest of the distribution,
except for points that are identified as outliers. The coloured lines mark weak, moderate, and ambitious targets in 2100 (Extended
Data Table 2). The red and blue (discrete) colour gradients specify the percentage that the pathway’s performance is deteriorating
or improving from the state of the world in 2015. They also show the progress direction and can be used to understand how ambitious
the target levels are in comparison the 2015 state of the world.
