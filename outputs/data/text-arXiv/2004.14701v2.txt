In all Countries the political decisions aim to achieve an almost stable configuration with a small
number of new infected individuals per day due to Covid-19. When such a condition is reached,
the containment effort is usually reduced in favor of a gradual reopening of the social life and of
the various economical sectors. However, in this new phase, the infection spread restarts and a
quantitative analysis of the regrowth is very useful. We discuss a macroscopic approach which,
on the basis of the collected data in the first lockdown, after few days from the beginning of the
new phase, outlines different scenarios of the Covid-19 diffusion for longer time. The purpose of
this paper is a demonstration-of-concept: one takes simple growth models, considers the available
data and shows how the future trend of the spread can be obtained. The method applies a time
dependent carrying capacity, analogously to many macroscopic growth laws in biology, economics
and population dynamics. The illustrative cases of Singapore, France, Spain and Italy are analyzed.

INTRODUCTION

The pandemic spreading of the Coronavirus infection
2019 (COVID-19) [1–3] is forcing billion of people to live
in isolation. The related economical degrowth is producing dramatic conditions for workers, trade and industry.
In all Countries the political decisions aim to reduce
the spreading and to achieve an almost stable configuration of coexistence with the disease, where a small number of new infected individuals per day is sustainable.
In this new condition, the containment effort is usually
reduced in favor of a gradual reopening of the social life
and of the various economical sectors: the so called phase
2 (Ph2).
In the Ph2 the spread usually restarts and the evaluation of the regrowth of the infection diffusion is a complex
problem: microscopic models require a coupled dynamics
of the stakeholders, implying a strong model dependence
and a large number of free parameters [4–9]. For example, the asymptomatic population has been estimated
about ≤ 50 [10], ≃ 10 [11], ≃ 3 − 4 [12, 13] times the
symptomatic one and the simulation in the Italian report
on the effects of the reopening on the National Health
System is based on a stochastic epidemic model including
the age dependence, the demographic structure, the heterogeneity of social contacts in different meeting places
(home, school, work, public transportation, cultural activity, shop, bank, post office) and many work sub-sectors

(public health, manufacturing, building, trade, ...) [14].
On the other hand, complementary approaches, which
outline the Covid-19 evolution in Ph2 in a model independent way, on the basis of macroscopic growth laws
(with few parameters) are a useful tool for monitoring
the regrowth of the spreading by collecting data after
few days from the end of the lockdown or, in general, of
the restarting phase.
In this paper we propose a method, based on macroscopic variables [13, 15–17] and with no explicit reference
to the underlying dynamics, which analyzes the quantitative consequences of the impairment of the constraints.
The starting point is the observation that the Covid19 spreading, after an initial exponential increase and a
subsequent small slowdown (which follows the Gompertz
law (GL) [18] or other non linear trends), reaches a saturation, stable phase, described by the GL or by a logistic
equation (LL) [19], after which the Ph2 starts.
The GL, initially applied to human mortality tables
(i.e. aging), also describes tumor growth, kinetics of enzymatic reactions, oxygenation of hemoglobin, intensity
of photosynthesis as a function of CO2 concentration,
drug dose-response curve, dynamics of growth, (e.g., bacteria, normal eukaryotic organisms). The LL [19] has
been used in population dynamics, in economics, in material science and in many other sectors.
The previous macroscopic growth laws, GL and LL,
depend on two parameters, related to the initial exponential trend and to the maximum number of infected
individuals, N∞ , called carrying capacity.
It is well known that the carrying capacity changes according to some “external” conditions in many biological,

2
economical and social systems [20]. In tumor growth it
is related to a multi-stage evolution [21]. In population
dynamics, new technologies affect how resources are consumed, and since the carrying capacity depends on the
availability of that resource, its value changes [22].
Therefore a simple method of monitoring the Ph2 is
to understand how the carrying capacity (CC) increases
due to the reduction of the social isolation and to the
restarting of the economical activities. As discussed, this
modification is difficult to predict, but different scenarios
of regrowth (i.e. with different time dependence of CC in
the Ph2, for example) are analyzed in the next sections.
By monitoring the initial data in the new phase one
outlines the behavior of the spreading for longer time to
evaluate the possible effects of new mobility constraints
or new total lockdown. If the infection regrows exponentially, the (re)lockdown and/or other containment efforts
have to be decided as soon as possible. On the other
hand, a small change of the specific rate in the Ph2, parameterized by a slight modification of the CC, should
require less urgent political choices.

A.

Macroscopic growth law with time dependent
carrying capacity

The macroscopic growth laws for a population N (t)
are solutions of a general differential equation that can
be written as
(1)

where f (N ) is the specific growth rate and its N dependence describes the feedback effects during the time
evolution. If f (N ) = constant, the growth follows an
exponential pattern.
In particular, the Gompertz and the logistic equations
are
1 dN (t)
N (t)
= −kg ln g
N (t) dt
N∞


1 dN (t)
N (t)
= kl 1 − l
N (t) dt
N∞

g,l
dN∞
= β g,l (t)

(4)

where β g,l (t) are the rates: β = 0, β =constant, β ≃ tn ,
β ≃ c exp(b t) give respectively constant, linear, power
law and exponential time dependence of the CC.

THEORY AND CALCULATIONS

1 dN (t)
= f [N (t)]
N (t) dt

the growth. However the CC can be modified by effects
not included in eqs. (2, 3). For example, the invention
and diffusion of technologies lift the growth limit.
For Covid-19 infection, in the Ph2 phase there is a fast
increase of the human mobility and aggregation which,
considering the large number of asymptomatic individuals, modifies the CC. Moreover, one has to take into account that other pathological features of the virus could
be different in the new phase (viral load, external temperature, ...) also.
Therefore one introduces an extension to the widelyused macroscopic model to allow for a time dependent
carrying capacity and a change in the parameter which
characterize the exponential initial phase, due to the different infectious features of the Covid-19. In other terms,
eqs. (2, 3) are now respectively coupled with different values of the constant kg or kl and a differential equation for
the evolution of the CC, i.e. (g=Gompertz, l=logistic)

g
where kg ln(N∞
) and kl are respectively the initial exponential rates and the other terms determine their slowdown. In both cases the steady state condition, dN/dt =
0 is reached when N is equal to the carrying capacity
N∞ .
As shown in refs. [13, 17] the coronavirus spreading
has, in general, three phases: an initial exponential behavior, followed by a Gompertz one and a final logistic
phase, due to lockdown.
In many dynamical systems the previous, simple, GL
or LL solutions give a good quantitative understanding of

Covid-19 spreading in phase 2 - formulation

The application of the previous differential equations
to the spreading of Covid-19 in the Ph2 in different Countries requires: a) the time, t⋆ , of the beginning of the
change of the isolation conditions and/or of the restarting phase; b) a stable phase of the infection diffusion for
t < t⋆ : the effects of the political decision of reducing
the constraints start (or should start) when the disease
shows a clear slowdown (see below).
Therefore for t ≤ t⋆ the total number of infected indig,l
viduals is described by eqs. (2,3) with constant N∞
fitted
⋆
by the available data, and for t ≥ t one has to solve the
system of coupled differential equations (2-4) where the
CC is a function of time, with the initial condition that
g,l ⋆
g,l
N∞
(t ) = N∞
.
A simple example is useful to outline the strategy. If a
(g,l)
time t∗ the spread is stable, then N (t∗ ) ≃ N∞ and the
specific rate is very small. Let us assume tha for t > t∗
there is a fast rate of the spreading which follows the GL
in the new phase with a new CC, i.e.

that is

g
and if ln γ >> ln[N (t∗ )/N∞
] a new exponential phase of
the spreading starts for t > t∗ .
The condition t > t⋆ has to be better clarified.
The instantaneous change of the CC is unphysical since
there is a time interval to observe a possible increase of
the spreading due to the Covid-19 incubation time, ∆.
Therefore in the time interval t⋆ < t < t⋆ + ∆ the growth
behavior still follows the initial phase, with a fixed CC.
The study of the incubation time is crucial to define the
delay (after t⋆ ) of a possible regrowth. This aspect is
discussed in the next section and to clarify the proposed
method let us assume that a logistic trend up to t⋆ = 60
l
days, with a CC, N∞
= 2883, is modified at the day
t⋆ = 60 + ∆, with ∆ = 5, by an increase of the CC
by a constant factor (1.02, 1.1, 1.20). Fig. 1 shows the
cumulative number of detected infected individuals.
The previous examples are for illustrative purposes and
in the next sections we apply the proposed approach to
Singapore, France, Spain and Italy, including the effects
of the delay ∆.

Covid-19 incubation time

The definition of the incubation time, or the time from
infection to illness onset, is necessary to inform choices of
quarantine periods, active monitoring, surveillance, control and modeling. COVID-19 emerged just recently,
and the presence of a high rate of asymptomatic individuals, does not currently allow a precise estimation of
incubation time. Different studies, especially at the beginning of the pandemic, tried to define the incubation
period, obtaining a mean time varying between 4.0 and
6.4 days [23–25].

Figure 2: Italy - Confirmed daily rate.

This value of incubation time is similar to other Coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and generally accepted as a reliable estimate. However, 95% confidence intervals are large, varying from 2.4 days to 15.5
days [23]. This strong variability is related to an uncertainty of the most probable date of exposure and onset
of symptoms and this is the main reason why the WHO
recommended an isolation time of 14 days after exposure
to avoid more spreading of the infection [26].
In our study, knowledge of the incubation time is necessary to model possible consequence of a re-opening. As
a matter of fact, reduction of social isolation will increase the CC, and our attention should still be at its
highest levels for at least two entire incubation periods,
to promptly recognize any warning signal and apply the
right control measures.
Therefore the incubation time ∆ ≃ 8 ± 6 days can be
considered and ∆ = 6 will be used in the next sections.
Let us recall that an increase of Covid-19 mortality in
Ph2 should be observed after a longer time interval. In
Italy, for example, the correlation between the rate of
infected people per day and the corresponding mortality
rate shows a delay of about 8 days (see figs. 2 and 3).
Therefore an increase of mortality could be expected after
14-22 days from t⋆ .

The indication coming from the previous analysis is
that the increase of the spreading rate, observed immediately after the starting of the new phase, is so strong
to require a sudden (re)lockdown of the Country.

Singapore: an early case of regrowth

In Singapore, after reaching a stable phase, a new
strong growth of the infection spreading has been observed, due to the immigration of workers from neighboring Countries. This effect can be described in terms
of a modified CC with respect to the saturation phase.
The data of N (t) before the restart of the infection can
be fitted either by Gompert (red line) or by logistic (orange line), as shown in fig. 4. The initial day of the PH2,
t⋆ , corresponds to about t = 32 and t∗ + ∆ = 38 (March
2).
By applying the method discussed in the previous section, the entire data sample can be fitted by assuming

PHASE 2 IN ITALY: POSSIBLE
SCENARIOS

In the first phase, the Italian data followed a GL. Recently, the Ph2 phase started in early September, and
different regrowth scenarios will be outlined by assuming
an increase of the CC.
For the previous trends (a, b, c), figures 6, 7 and 8
show respectively the comparison of the growth laws with
the data of the cumulative number of confirmed infected
individuals from t∗ + ∆ = September the 1st to the final
day, of the daily number of confirmed infected individuals
in the same period, and of the daily number of confirmed
infected individuals from the initial day 22/Feb to the
final day, respectively.
Figures 9, 10 and 11 depict the analogous comparisons
for the cumulative number of deaths, for the daily number of deaths and for the daily number of deaths from
the initial day 22/Feb to the final day, respectively.
The effects of the mobility constraints decided by the
Italian government can be monitored by looking at the
different predicted trends.

COMMENTS AND CONCLUSIONS

Figures 21, 22 and 23 report the growth laws results
versus data of the cumulative number of deaths from the

The purpose of this paper is a demonstration-ofconcept: one takes simple growth models, considers the
available data and shows different scenarios of the future
trend of the spreading. The method applies a time dependent carrying capacity since the reduction of containment
efforts change this crucial parameters of the macroscopic
growth laws. Different time behaviors of the CC outline
various trends in the new phase.
Therefore a comparison of data, collected in a short
time interval, with the plots obtained by the various
ansatz for the CC can help to decide if the social isolation conditions have to be strengthened or weakened.
Moreover, a large variation of the CC signals an increase
of the pressure on the National Health systems.
