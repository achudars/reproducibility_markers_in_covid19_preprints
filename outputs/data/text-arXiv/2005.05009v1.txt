Abstract: The coronavirus which appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan has
spread out worldwide and caused the death of more than 280,000 people (as of
May 12, 2020). Since February 2020, doubts were raised about the numbers of
confirmed cases and deaths reported by the Chinese government. In this paper,
we examine data available from China at the city and provincial levels and
we compare them with Canadian provincial data, US state data and French
regional data. We consider cumulative and daily numbers of confirmed cases
and deaths and examine these numbers through the lens of their first two
digits and in particular we measure departures of these first two digits to the
Newcomb-Benford distribution, often used to detect frauds. Our finding is
that there is no evidence that cumulative and daily numbers of confirmed
cases and deaths for all these countries have different first or second digit
distributions. We also show that the Newcomb-Benford distribution cannot
be rejected for these data.
Key words and phrases: Newcomb-Benford distribution; Multinomial distribution; χ2 tests.

Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, is an infectious disease
that was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan in the Hubei province of China.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the Covid-19 outbreak a Public Health
Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March
2020. As reported by the Chinese government on 29 February 2020 the cumulative number of confirmed cases was 79,968 while the cumulative number of deaths was 2,873.1
In the meantime, data reported by the Chinese government have been questioned and
suspicion has been raised about the government intentionally hiding the real situation.
This idea spread out worldwide in February and March 2020, see for instance articles in
Radio-Canada2 , Le Devoir3 , New York Times4 , Bloomberg5 , Le Monde6 or the wikipedia
page about the coronavirus pandemic in mainland China7 . A similar question could also
be asked for data reported by other countries.
The present time is definitely the era of data scientists and a considerable effort has
been made to make data available (Alamo et al., 2020) at different levels (national, provincial, etc). The objective of this paper is to provide an empirical comparison for several
countries (China, Canada, US and France) and see if we can detect anomalies in such data
using first or second digit analysis from these numbers. We would like to emphasize that
the intention of this paper is not to single out any country (actually the main conclusion
from this paper is that digit distributions from these data look quite similar). In the same
way, we do not provide any direct conclusion that there were no frauds in reporting data.

What guided the curiosity of the author was to investigate the possible use (or not) of a
statistical distribution, namely the Newcomb-Benford distribution, to model digits from
Covid-19 data.
Pick any series of numbers and make a table of the leading digit (1 for 1234, 4 for
432, etc.) then there is a “high chance” that the most frequent digit is 1, then 2, etc.
To illustrate this, Figure 1 reports frequencies of the leading digit for population sizes of
the 800 Canadian largest cities in 20118 . Such a surprising phenomenon turns out to be
observable in many real-life datasets.

sizes of the 800 largest Canadian cities in 2011.

In 1881, Newcomb (1881) wrote “That the ten digits do not occur with equal frequency
must be evident to any one making much use of logarithmic tables, and noticing how
much faster the first pages wear out than the last ones”. Benford (1938) formalized this
observation and formulated a distribution for the first leading digit. This distribution,

known as the first digit law, is now often referred to as the Newcomb-Benford distribution.
Since then, this distribution has been extended in many directions: generalization of this
law to numbers expressed in other bases, and also a generalization from leading 1 digit to
leading m digits (and actually the joint distribution of the first m digits). In particular
Table 1 reports the marginal distribution for the first and second digits. Figure 1 depicts
the distribution of the Newcomb-Benford for the first digit and it can be observed that first
digits from Canadian cities sizes in 2011 are not far from a Newcomb-Benford distribution.

An important mathematical and statistical literature, from which Genest and Genest
(2011); Berger and Hill (2015); Varian (1972) constitute excellent overviews, reveals explanations about this phenomenon. An intuition (see e.g. Gauvrit and Delahaye, 2008) is
that fractional parts of logarithms of numbers tend to be uniformly distributed. Now think
reversely: if the fractional part of log10 (x) is uniformly distributed then naturally x has
more chance to occur between 1 and 2 than between 9 and 10 and the Newcomb-Benford
distribution can be derived in this way.
The Newcomb-Benford distribution has interesting properties: scale invariance (Pinkham,
1961), connections with mixture of uniform distributions (Janvresse and De la Rue, 2004),
etc. In statistics, Formann (2010) investigates how common distributions are related to
the Newcomb-Benford one. Also, like the Gaussian curve for the empirical mean, or the
Gumbel distribution for the maximum of random variables, the Newcomb-Benford distribution appears as a natural limit, see for instance Genest and Genest (2011) or Chenavier
et al. (2018) (and references therein) for recent developments on this subject.
From a practical point of view, the Newcomb-Benford distribution (and in particular
4

the first digit law) has been used in an attempt to detect frauds in reported numbers.
For instance, Deckert et al. (2011) used it to detect frauds in elections, El Sehity et al.
(2005) investigated consumer price digits before and after the euro introduction for price
adjustments, Müller (2011) found out possible frauds in the macroeconomic data the
Greek government reported, Diekmann (2007) or Gauvrit and Delahaye (2008) made use
of this distribution to detect frauds in scientific papers, etc.
In this paper, we investigate the use of the first and second digit distribution to detect
potential anomalies in reported Covid-19 data. Because most of daily and cumulative data
are quite large, an analysis of the first two digits separately seems relevant. Analyzing
the third digit or analyzing the joint distribution of the first two digits however would
drastically reduce the sample size of data and has not been considered. We investigate the
numbers of confirmed cases and deaths reported by several countries, more specifically
China, Canada, US and France, and aim at detecting potential differences between these
countries. Such data are recorded at a national level. To the best of our knowledge, there is
no theory that the first or second digit of epidemiological data should obey the NewcombBenford distribution but given the important literature on the Benford’s phenomenon,
investigating such a question is worthwile. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
The data acquisition and preprocessing is described in Section 2. Results are presented
in Section 3 and discussed in Section 4.

Data collection and preprocessing

Since February 2020, amazing efforts have been done to collect and share data at different
levels. Many governments, public health institutions or media provide open data for
tracking cases, number of deaths, etc. Alamo et al. (2020) propose an interesting and
quite complete survey on the main open-resources for addressing the Covid- 19 pandemic
from a data science point of view. In this paper, we use six different sources of time series
data recorded daily. The data are slightly preprocessed in order to not pay too much
attention on very small numbers of confirmed cases or deaths for small cities, provinces,
5

states or regions. Datasets have been imported and preprocessed using the R software,
which is also used to produce simulations and numerical results presented in the next
section. Let us detail the data sources and the preprocessing step.
• Chinese data: we use the R package nCov19 written by Wu et al. (2020) which
collects data at city level in China. Hubei province concentrates more than 97% of
reported deaths in China. We therefore consider the numbers of Hubei province and
aggregate numbers of all others provinces. Inside Hubei province, we keep numbers
for the cities of Wuhan, Xiaogan and Huanggang (92% of reported deaths in Hubei
province as of May 12, 2020) . Other cities are not considered as they contained
several artefacts. The data at the national level are finally added to the dataset.
• Canadian data: the Public Health Agency of Canada provides a daily report, available as a csv file9 , of confirmed cases and deaths for Canadian provinces. In addition
to these data, we have also access to regional data from Quebec. Regional data compiled into a json file, were kindly provided by Antoine Bland web developer at Le
Devoir10 . We aggregate the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths of provinces
of Canada (resp. regions of Quebec) which have, as of May 12, 2020, a cumulative
number of deaths smaller than the first decile of the cumulative number of deaths
of Canada. We also add data at the national level to the dataset.
• US data: several sources of data can be found on the web. We use data reported
by the COVID Tracking Project https://covidtracking.com/ (an open data
repository which is cited by several US newspapers)11 . As we did for Canada, we
aggregate (in the same way) states which have small numbers of cumulative numbers
of deaths as of May 12, 2020. Finally, national numbers reported by ECDPC (see
below) are added to the dataset.

• French data: the Public France Health System provides open data at the official
open data portal https://www.data.gouv.fr/. We consider the regional data
available as a csv file12 . This dataset describes numbers of hospitalized cases and
deaths at hospitals. As we did for Canada and the US, we aggregate small regions
of France and data at the national level reported by ECDPC (see below) are added
to the dataset.
• International dataset: the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control
provides data at the national level available worldwide as a csv file13 . We use these
data for France and the USA which seem to be more complete. For France for
instance, the numbers of deaths take into account the ones which appear in nursing
homes.
All Data are recorded daily. They are collected since December 2019 for China, February 1 2020 for Canada, February 29 2020 for the US, March 18 for France and December
31, for the international dataset. For all datasets except the French one, we have at our
disposal cumulative and daily numbers of confirmed cases and deaths. For France, the
numbers of confirmed cases are not available and are substituted by numbers of hospitalized patients. In the rest of this paper, we make an abuse and speak of confirmed cases for
hospitalized patients in France. Depending on the national public policies, the number
of reported cases and deaths are not standardized, which has given rise to massive and
heated debates. It is not the intention of this paper to present or discuss these policies.
We refer the reader to the different websites to understand how a case or death is considered for the different countries (note that even between two US states or Canadian
provinces, the way numbers are reported are different).
The study period goes from December 1, 2019 to May 12, 2020 when we analyze daily
numbers of confirmed cases or deaths. When we analyze cumulative data, we have to

be careful as some cities, provinces or countries have already passed the epidemiological
peak, meaning that the cumulative number of cases or deaths remain almost unchanged
several days or weeks in a row. For the city of Wuhan for instance, the cumulative number
of deaths has remained between 2000 and 3000 since February, 25 and for several weeks in
a row. So there would be a clear overexpression of the digit 2 for this time series data if we
were to keep the same study period as for analyzing daily data. Thus, when we analyze
cumulative data, we stopped the study period as of February 15, 2020 for Chinese data
and April, 15 for other ones. Keeping cumulative numbers in the data analysis is highly
relevant as there is a consensus in the epidemiological literature that numbers of cases
or deaths grow exponentially and exponential curves are known to follow quite well the
Newcomb-Benford distribution (see e.g. Berger and Hill, 2015).
Tables 2 summarizes this section and provides as of May 12, 2020, the sample sizes
available for analyzing first or second digit for each dataset. Obviously, for the second
digit, we focus on numbers of confirmed cases and deaths that are larger than 10.

Results

Figures 2-5 summarize the efforts of this data analysis. For daily numbers (Figures 2-3)
and cumulative numbers (Figures 4-5) of confirmed cases and deaths reported for China,
Canada, USA and France, we estimate proportions of digits 1,2,. . . ,9 (for the first digit)
and 0,1,. . . ,9 (for the second one). This information is represented by red curves (observed
frequencies) in Figures 2-5. For each dataset (i.e. for first or second digit analysis,
each type of data and each country), we also measure empirically departures from the
Newcomb-Benford distribution. Thus, boxplots correspond to estimates of proportions of
first or second digit based on B = 5000 simulations of sample size n from the NewcombBenford distribution. These figures do not constitute a formal goodness-of-fit test. This
will be examined later taking into account the multiplicity of tests. However, it is clear
that the Newcomb-Benford distribution seems to be an excellent candidate.
Small departures to the Newcomb-Benford distribution seem noticeable in Figures 2
and 4: for instance digits 1 and 6 (resp. 1) for daily numbers of confirmed cases in China
(resp. China), digit 3 for daily numbers of deaths in Canada, etc. Small departures
are also noticeable in Figures 3 and 5. Because the sample size slightly decreases when
analyzing second digits, violin boxplots exhibit slightly higher dispersion.
The first and clear conclusion drawn from Figures 2-5 is that daily and cumulative
numbers of confirmed cased and deaths exhibit a first digit phenomenon. Digit 1 is the
most frequent, followed by 2, etc. As a second general conclusion, it does appear that the
empirical distributions of digits for one type of data seem quite similar across countries.
Overall, we also remark that the distribution of digits seem to be closer to the NewcombBenford distribution for cumulative data than for daily data.
To continue this data analysis, Figure 6 provides a more formal and quantitative
approach. For each of the 32 datasets (2 digits, 4 countries, confirmed cases/deaths,
daily/cumulative data), we perform a χ2 goodness-of-fit test to judge the adequacy of
the Newcomb-Benford distribution. Since the sample size is not large for some datasets,
we estimate the distribution of the standard χ2 statistic under H0 using Monte Carlo

9

approach (B = 5000 replications are used). Figure 6 reports adjusted p-values in percentage. Given the quite large number of tests done in this paper, all p-values in this
manuscript are adjusted as a whole, using a false discovery control procedure. Procedures which control false discovery rate are subject to assumptions on the distribution
of p-values. The most well-known procedure is Benjamini-Hochberg’s (BH) procedure
(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) which requires a PRDS assumption (positive regression
type dependency, see Benjamini and Yekutieli (2001)). This assumption seems really
complex and is probably wrong in the context of this paper: the number of deaths depends on the number of confirmed cases, the distribution of first digit is not independent
of the distribution of second digit and cumulative data depend on daily data. All these
characteristics have influence on the dependence on p-values. Thus, we also adjust pvalues using the Benjamini-Yekutieli’s (BY) procedure (Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2001)
which allows an FDR control under any type of dependence. Although BY’s procedure
is more conservative than the BH’s procedure, it does control theoretically FDR at level
5%. Figure 6 presents raw values and adjusted p-values using BH and BY’s procedures.
Figure 6 reveals that no discovery can be made at FDR level 5%. The smallest BY’s
adjusted p-value equals 38.5% (note that even the smallest BH’s adjusted p-value, 8.6%,
is larger than 5%) and most of adjusted p-values are close or equal to 100%. Clearly, as
every (omnibus) goodness-of-fit test should be interpreted, this does not prove that each
dataset should be modeled by a Newcomb-Benford distribution (for the first or second
digit) but tends to convince us that these models are legitimate.
Figure 7 is less focused on the Newcomb-Benford model. We aim at measuring differences between the datasets by constructing 95% simultaneous confidence intervals.
Different solutions for the computation of simultaneous confidence intervals for a single multinomial distribution have been proposed in the literature. We consider, here,
the approximation proposed by Sison and Glaz (1995), implemented in the R package
MultinomialCI. To take into account the multiplicity of confidence intervals (32 intervals
of multinomial distributions in total), we simply apply the Bonferroni correction. We
also report the Newcomb-Benford probabilities as a reference. The conclusion follows
10

along the same lines as previous figures. It seems impossible to draw any firm conclusion
from Figure 7 that one dataset behaves differenty from other ones. Figure 8 strenghtens
this comment. We report p-values for χ2 independence tests, where we test the distribution of counts for one dataset against the variable country. By count dataset, we mean
here the distribution of counts for first or second digit, for daily or cumulative numbers
of confirmed cases or deaths. For each such count distribution, we analyze through χ2
independence tests, either differences between different countries, or difference between
China and other countries. All p-values (estimated using a Monte Carlo approach with
B = 5000 replications) are adjusted using BH’s procedure as well as BY’s procedure.
Again, Figure 8 shows that no null hypothesis can be rejected at FDR level 5% since the
smallest BY’s adjusted is much larger than 5%. Thus, there is no clear evidence of any
difference between the different countries considered in this study or between China and
others.

Discussion

The Newcomb-Benford distribution is often used on real datasets to detect potential wrong
reports of numbers. Applied to Covid-19 daily and cumulative numbers of confirmed cases
and deaths for China, Canada, USA and France, it is clear that these data exhibit the
first digit phenomenon as initially observed by Newcomb (1881). We find out that the
Newcomb-Benford distribution for the first and second digits cannot be rejected at a
false discovery rate 5%. This does not prove that the leading digits of epidemiological
data should be modeled by Newcomb-Benford distribution. Nevertheless, it opens an
interesting research question: could we prove that the first digits of data that fit SIR
models (or extensions) follow the Newcomb-Benford distribution? This is clearly out of
the scope of this note.
Putting aside the Newcomb-Benford model, our analysis shows that there are no qualitative differences between data from the Chinese government and from other countries
(considered in this study), although that sources of biases for all datasets are very large
11

(for instance the province of Quebec stands out for reporting also deaths for suspected
people to Covid-19 which was not the case in France before the beginning of April).
This data analysis has its obvious limitations. Showing that frequencies of digits are
close to expected probabilities, or showing that frequencies between two countries are quite
similar does neither prove nor disprove that there was a fraud in the reported numbers.
If, for instance, one multiplies by 10 each daily number of deaths or confirmed cases,
the results remain unchanged! However, as mentioned in the introduction, NewcombBenford distribution has been applied to many real-life datasets and it is interesting to
see, as perhaps might have been expected, that this model also shows up when analyzing
Covid-19 data.

Figure 8: P-values (in %) of the χ2 independence goodness-of-fit tests between digits
(first and second digits for daily and cumulative numbers of confirmed cases and deaths)
and the variable “Countries”. The latter is either composed of the four countries, or
two countries China and the other ones which are aggregated. P-values are obtained via
Monte Carlo using B = 5000 replications. The left column corresponds to raw values, the
middle one to values adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg’s procedure, while the right
column to adjusted p-values using the Benjamini-Yekutieli’s procedure. Dashed red line
corresponds to the level 5%. Points are slightly jittered for a better visualization.
