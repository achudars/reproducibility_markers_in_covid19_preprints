Abstract
We estimate the short- to medium term impact of six major past pandemic crises on the CO2
emissions and energy transition to renewable electricity. The results show that the previous
pandemics led on average to a 3.4-3.7% fall in the CO2 emissions in the short-run (1-2 years
since the start of the pandemic). The effect is present only in the rich countries, as well as in
countries with the highest pandemic death toll (where it disappears only after 8 years) and in
countries that were hit by the pandemic during economic recessions. We found that the past
pandemics increased the share of electricity generated from renewable sources within the fiveyear horizon by 1.9-2.3 percentage points in the OECD countries and by 3.2-3.9 percentage
points in countries experiencing economic recessions. We discuss the implications of our findings in the context of CO2 emissions and the transition to renewable energy in the post-COVID19 era.

1. Introduction
As of April 2021, the WHO data show that the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in almost 150
million infections and more than 3 million deaths worldwide. The global economy has been hit
hard both by the health shock and governments’ policy responses aimed at curbing the infections. Recent estimates of the World Bank suggest that the global economy has shrunk by 4.3%
in 2020, while the GDP in advanced economies contracted by 5.4% [1]. Although the economy
is expected to rebound in 2021, the prospects for overall growth recovery are uncertain. The
pandemic has brought significant changes to energy production from fossil fuels, greenhouse
gases emissions and the production of energy from renewable sources [2]. Several recent studies estimated the immediate impact of the pandemic and government responses on the reduction
of CO2 emissions [3–6]. [7] report that global CO2 emissions are projected to decline by about
7% in 2020. On the other hand, the share of electricity generated from renewable sources has
increased in many European countries [8,9]. However, since the global economy will return to
growth in 2021 and many of the pandemic-related restrictions are to be lifted we may expect
that the observed reduction in CO2 emissions and the rise in the use of renewables could be
rather temporary and have little effect on the pace of transition towards a low-carbon economy
in the long-run. The long-run impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the energy sector and
climate change depends also on government anti-crisis stimulus packages introduced in 20202021 by national governments and intergovernmental institutions like the European Union
[7,10]. If those packages contribute to a sizeable increase in clean technology investment as
well as discourage the use of fossil fuel-based technologies, the overall effect of COVID-19
and the post-crisis government responses could be accelerating the energy transition. However,
1

at this point the longer run effect of COVID-19 is very uncertain as the pandemic is still an
ongoing phenomenon.
In this paper, we attempt to throw some light on the possible short- to medium-term
impacts of COVID-19 on CO2 emissions and transition to renewable energy use by looking at
the evidence provided by the past pandemics. In particular, we consider the following six major
pandemic episodes from the last half of the century: H3N2 Flu (1968), SARS (2003), H1N1
Swine Flu (2009), MERS (2012), Ebola (2014), and Zika (2016). Using the standard macroeconomic method of measuring the effect of exogenous shocks, a local projection approach introduced by [11], we estimate the impact of past pandemics on CO2 emissions and the share of
electricity generated from renewables observed over the 5-year horizon after the onset of a
pandemic episode.1 Our baseline data on CO2 emissions comes from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) database [12] and cover the period 1751-2017 for 203 nations, while the data on renewable energy is from the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s
(EIA) international energy statistics [13] and cover up to 201 countries between 1980 and 2018.
To preview our results, we find that the previous pandemics had a significant negative
impact on CO2 emissions in the short-run, especially in the OECD countries and in countries
that entered the pandemic in bad economic times (recessions). In countries that suffered the
most from the pandemics in terms of mortality, the negative impact continued over 8 years.
Regarding the transition to renewable energy, our results show no significant effects for the
whole sample of countries, but sizeable gains for the OECD countries and countries hit by the
pandemics during periods of low economic growth. To provide evidence relevant for the
COVID-19, which in general generated a much larger health and economic crisis than the past
pandemics that we study, we investigate the heterogeneity of our results with respect to the
pandemic severity as measured by the pandemic death toll. The evidence from past pandemics
provided in this paper gives a useful benchmark for thinking about the short- and medium-term
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic for CO2 emissions and transition to low-carbon technologies. We discuss the implications of our findings for the energy transition in the post-COVID19 era using early estimates of changes in renewables’ use in 2020 and information on green
stimulus packages implemented by governments around the world to boost economic growth
in an environment-friendly way.
Section 2 of the reminder provides a short description of our data on previous pandemic
events, CO2 emissions and the share of electricity generated from renewable sources. We briefly
introduce our empirical methodology based on the local projection method in section 3, while
our results are presented and discussed in section 4. The last section concludes.
2. Data
2.1. Pandemic events
We follow [14] in focusing on the six post-war pandemics: H3N2 Flu (1968), SARS (2003),
H1N1 Swine Flu (2009), MERS (20212), Ebola (2014), and Zika (2016).2 Table A1 in the
Appendix presents the list of all countries affected during a given pandemic. Our main pandemic-related variable is a dummy marking the timing of the pandemic’s outbreak according
to the official WHO declarations. However, since the impact of different pandemics varied significantly by country in terms of mortality due to the pandemic we exploit also additional
measures of crisis severity. We follow [14] in using three dummy variables capturing the

Several papers have recently applied the local projection method to study the effects of past pandemics on various
economic outcomes [14,33–35]. The approach has been also used to study the impact of economic and financial
crises on CO2 emissions [23,24] and air pollutant emissions [26].

relative health severity of the pandemics. High-severity countries are defined as those that experienced pandemic-related mortality higher than the 70th percentile of the distribution of
cross-country mortality due to the pandemic. Medium-severity countries are those in which the
mortality was within the range between the 30th and 70th percentile of the distribution, while
for low-severity countries the mortality was below the 30th percentile. Our sample covers the
1950-2019 period with 294 country-year observations indicating the start of the pandemic
shock.
2.2. CO2 emissions data
The CO2 data used in this paper come from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center
(CDIAC) database [12] and cover the period 1751-2017 for 203 nations. This data set includes
emissions from solid fuel consumption, liquid fuel consumption, gas fuel consumption, cement
production, and gas flaring. The CDIAC data are originally expressed in thousand metric tons
of carbon. We converted the data to the units of CO2 by multiplying them by 3.667. In our
empirical models, we exploit annual country-level emissions measured using the logarithm of
CO2 emissions per capita.
In a robustness analysis, we used CO2 emissions data from the Emissions Database for
Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), which is developed and maintained by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission [15]. Currently, the EDGAR database offers CO2
emissions data for 202 countries over 1970-2019. The EDGAR CO2 emissions estimates are on
average slightly higher than those from the CDIAC as they include also emissions from landuse change (e.g., deforestation) and decomposition of all fossil carbonates. On the other hand,
the CDIAC data set starts much earlier allowing us to account also for the 1968 H3N2 Flu pandemic.3
2.3. Share of electricity generated from renewables
To measure the impact of pandemic shocks on the development of renewable energy, we use a
percentage share of renewable energy in total electricity generation.4 This indicator is the most
popular measure of renewable energy deployment [16]. A percentage measure allows making
meaningful comparisons across countries and time and indicates the changing role of renewable
energy sources in the country’s overall electricity mix. Renewable energy data used in the paper
are from the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) international energy statistics on
electricity generation) [13]. Renewable energy sources include wind, solar, hydroelectricity,
biomass, geothermal, wave, and tidal electricity. The data set covers up to 201 countries between 1980 and 2018. Table A2 in the Appendix presents the descriptive statistics for all variables used.
3. Empirical methodology
Pandemic outbreaks are largely exogenous shocks to the economic, health and energy systems.
Their impact on the relevant outcomes can be estimated using impulse response functions
(IRFs) – a standard macroeconomic tool capturing the dynamic response of a variable to the
shock in another variable (see, e.g., [17,18]). While there are several approaches to estimate the
IRFs, the local projection (LP) method of Jordà [11] is simple, robust and provides straightforward inference tools [19]. In essence, the LPs are linear regressions of the dependent variable

shifted several periods ahead on the current and lagged values of the covariates. In our context,
we estimate the following equations:
𝑘
𝑘
𝑘
𝑘
(1)
𝑦𝑖,𝑡+𝑘 − 𝑦𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽𝑘 𝐷𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛾𝑘 𝑋𝑖,𝑡 + ∑𝑚
𝑗=1 𝛿𝑗 ∆𝑦𝑖,𝑡−𝑗 + 𝛼𝑖 + 𝜏𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 ,
where 𝑦𝑖,𝑡 is the logarithm of the dependent variable (CO2 emissions or share of electricity
generation from renewables) for country i in year t, 𝐷𝑖,𝑡 is a dummy variable indicating that the
pandemic shock occurred in the country i in year t, 𝑋𝑖,𝑡 is a vector of pre-determined control
variables, ∆𝑦𝑖,𝑡−𝑗 are the lags of the change in the dependent variable (with m set to 2). In some
specifications, we replace the pandemic dummy, 𝐷𝑖,𝑡 , with pandemic severity dummies (see
section 2.1) to account for the fact that different health crises hit some countries relatively
lightly (with no or little excess mortality), while having a very significant impact on other countries. Our control variables include two lags of the pandemic dummy, the GDP per capita and
the ratio of trade (sum of exports and imports of goods and services) to the GDP [20]. The lags
in the change of the (log of) dependent variable are controlled for since future changes in emissions or electricity generation from renewables could depend on past changes. We also include
country fixed effects, 𝛼𝑖𝑘 , and time fixed effects, 𝜏𝑡𝑘 , to control for unobserved, respectively,
time-invariant and country-invariant heterogeneity (i.e. global economic or financial shocks).
In our empirical analysis, we conduct separate estimations of IRFs for CO2 emissions
per capita and shares of electricity generation from renewable sources. The estimated 𝛽𝑘 regression coefficients in (1) represent LP estimates of IRFs to the pandemic shocks happening
at time t. They measure the percentage change in our dependent variables in countries affected
by the pandemics relative to the unaffected countries. We display responses of changes in the
dependent variables on figures as the dynamics of {𝛽𝑘 }5𝑘=0 for the time horizons of up to five
years after the shock. We also present 95% confidence intervals for our estimates calculated
with standard errors clustered at the country level.
The second regression specification that we use allows for testing whether the impact
of pandemics is different between advanced and other countries. To this end, we modify the
specification (1) by adding a dummy variable representing a given group of countries, G, as a
control variable and its interaction with the pandemic dummy:5
𝑘
𝑘
(2)
𝑦𝑖,𝑡+𝑘 − 𝑦𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽𝑘 𝐷𝑖,𝑡 + 𝜑 𝑘 𝐺𝑖,𝑡 + 𝜔𝑘 𝐺𝑖,𝑡 𝐷𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛾𝑘 𝑋𝑖,𝑡 + ∑𝑚
𝑗=1 𝛿𝑗 ∆𝑦𝑖,𝑡−𝑗 + 𝛼𝑖 +
𝑘
𝑘
𝜏𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 .
Finally, we use a third model specification to test whether the impact of pandemic
shocks on our dependent variables varies with the economic conditions (economic expansions
vs recessions) prevailing at the start of the pandemic. For instance, it could be that the impact
of pandemic shocks on the transition to renewable energy is more pronounced when the shocks
occur in a period of economic recession. Similarly, the fall in CO2 emissions can be higher in a
period of economic expansion. To test for this heterogeneity in the impact of pandemics on our
dependent variables, we estimate the following models [21–24]:
𝑘
𝑘
𝑦𝑖,𝑡+𝑘 − 𝑦𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽𝑘𝐿 𝐹(𝑧𝑖𝑡 )𝐷𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽𝑘𝐿 (1 − 𝐹(𝑧𝑖𝑡 ))𝐷𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛾𝑘 𝑋𝑖,𝑡 + ∑𝑚
𝑗=1 𝛿𝑗 ∆𝑦𝑖,𝑡−𝑗 + 𝛼𝑖 + (3)
𝑘
𝜏𝑡𝑘 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡
,
with
exp(−𝜎𝑧𝑖𝑡 )
𝐹(𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) =
,σ > 0
1+exp(−𝜎𝑧𝑖𝑡 )

where 𝑧𝑖𝑡 is an indicator of the business cycle normalized to have zero mean and a unit variance.
Following the literature [21–24], the contemporaneous yearly real GDP growth rate is our
choice for 𝑧𝑖𝑡 .6 𝐹(𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) is a smooth transition function used to estimate jointly the impact of past

The IRFs are then estimated using marginal effects of the pandemic dummy evaluated at the values of the G
dummies representing a given group of countries (e.g. OECD or lower-income countries).

pandemics on our dependent variables in economic expansions versus recessions. It can be interpreted as the probability of the economy being in a state of recession. The coefficients 𝛽𝑘𝐿
and 𝛽𝑘𝐿 capture the effects of the pandemic shocks at the horizon k when the economy, respectively, is in the state of low (negative) economic growth (𝐹(𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) ≈ 1 when z goes to minus
infinity) or high growth (1 − 𝐹(𝑧𝑖𝑡 ) ≈ 1 when z goes to plus infinity). The set of control variables X includes two lags of the following variables: pandemic dummy, the real GDP growth
rate, and 𝐹(𝑧𝑖𝑡 ).
4. Results and discussion
4.1. The effect of past pandemics on CO2 emissions
Figure 1 shows IRFs based on LP, estimated using equation (1), for the effect of previous pandemic shocks on CO2 emissions per capita. The estimation sample covers the 1961-2017 period
and up to 172 countries. The solid line shows the evolution of emissions in countries affected
by the six considered pandemics relative to unaffected countries over five years since the onset
of the pandemic shock. The results show that the past pandemics led to a short-term decline in
emissions. The pandemics decreased CO2 emissions per capita by 3.4-3.7% within 1-2 years
after the start of the shock.7 After three years, the effect becomes smaller and statistically insignificant. The size of the effect over the 1-2 years after the start of the pandemic is rather moderate. It is approximately equal to 23-25% of the standard deviation of the yearly change in CO2
emissions per capita in our sample. Alternatively, it is quantitatively similar to the 33-36% of
the average cumulative change in the CO2 emissions per capita over five consecutive years.

logarithm of the CO2 emissions per capita. See section 3 for a description of the model specification. Shaded areas

denoting the year when the pandemic started. The sample covers 172 countries over the 1961-2017 period. Full
regression results are available in Table A3 in the Appendix.

We obtained very similar estimates using EDGAR data on CO 2 emissions. Specifically, the effect of previous
pandemics on emissions based on EDGAR data ranges from -2.6% to -3.3% within the four years after the onset
of the pandemic episode. Full results based on EDGAR data are available upon request.

Our results can be compared with the early estimates on how CO2 emissions were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictive measures introduced by governments as a
response to the pandemic. The estimates of the 2020 global impact on emissions obtained by
Le Quéré et al. [3] are only slightly higher (a 4%-7% decrease) than ours. Similarly, the International Energy Agency (IEA) projected that global CO2 emissions should fall by 8% in 2020
[6]. On the other hand, estimates from near-real-time activity data constructed by the Carbon
Monitor initiative (https://carbonmonitor.org/) show that the global emissions declined by 6.2%
in 2020 with large heterogeneity between countries [5]. Projections show also that the emissions
are expected to rebound globally by 5.8% in 2021 [3]. In China, the reduction in CO2 emissions
in 2020 has been estimated to be about 1.6% over the full year, but it is expected that the economic stimulus packages will increase emissions in the next few years [25].
Overall, the existing estimates of the impact of COVID-19 on emissions are quite similar to those obtained in this paper for the case of previous pandemics. While the current shock
is probably going to have a somewhat larger immediate impact than the past pandemics, the
cumulative decline in emissions associated with COVID-19 is rather temporary and will likely
disappear in 2021 or 2022. It is also notable that our estimates are very close to those obtained
for the effect of financial crises on CO2 emissions. Financial crises seem to decrease CO2 emissions by 2-4% in a period of a few years after the crises, but the effect seems to disappear in the
medium- or longer-term [23,24,26].
Figure 2 provides additional insights into the effects of past pandemic shocks by studying the impacts differentiated by the health shock severity as measured by the relative scale of
pandemic-related mortality (see section 2.1). We observe that for medium-severity and lowseverity countries the impact of pandemics is mostly insignificant. If anything, it seems to be
positive in the fifth year after the onset of a pandemic event in the case of low-severity countries
(compared to countries unaffected by the pandemics). On the other hand, we can see a significant and persistent negative impact of the pandemic shocks on CO2 emissions for countries that
were hit in the hardest way (with relatively largest pandemic mortality). In these countries, the
emissions are lower by 3-4% in the period up to five years compared to the countries unaffected
by the pandemics. Figure 2 reveals also that in the fifth year after the start of pandemic events
the emissions are 4% lower than in unaffected countries. This effect is sustained over the 8year horizon after the onset of the pandemics but disappears afterwards.8 Overall, Figure 2 suggests that the decline in CO2 emissions due to the present crisis should also vary significantly
with the size of economic and health cost of COVID-19. In countries that experience the largest
GDP falls and the highest human toll due to the pandemic, the emissions should decline more
and the effect could last much longer relative to the less affected countries. This seems to create
the opportunity for these countries to implement the policies (carbon pricing, public investment
in low-carbon technologies, subsidies in green research) that could accelerate their decarbonization pace and reduce the transitional cost to a low-carbon economy. However, such a scenario
hinges on the countries’ institutional, political and fiscal capacity to introduce bold and radical
green efforts during the difficult period of pandemic crisis and recovery.
Figure 3 shows the differential impact of past pandemics on CO2 emissions in rich
(OECD) versus lower-income countries.9 The figure reveals that the negative impact of past
pandemics on CO2 emissions is present only in rich countries. If anything, emissions in lowerincome countries affected by the previous pandemics are slightly higher after five years compared to the unaffected countries. This observation may reflect the fact that the advanced economies were hit harder by the pandemics or that their governments responded to the past

We also analysed how the impact of past pandemics on CO2 emissions depends on the state of
the economy during the start of the pandemic. Figure 4 shows that, indeed, the effect is different
in periods of high economic growth (economic expansions) and low economic growth (recessions). In expansions, the pandemics have been increasing emissions, but the effect is generally
statistically insignificant. On the other hand, economic recessions are associated with significant reductions in CO2 emissions that oscillate around 5% (compared to the countries unaffected by the pandemics) and continue over the 5-year horizon that we study. This result is also
consistent with an explanation that pandemic-related reductions in emissions are due to the
contraction of economic activity either determined by the health crises themselves or by the
government responses that restrict economic activity to contain the pandemic.

the pandemic started. The sample covers 172 countries over the 1961-2017 period. Full regression results are

4.2. Previous pandemics and transition to renewable energy
Our baseline estimates of the impact of past pandemic shocks on the share of electricity generated from renewable sources are displayed in Figure 5. The average effect in the full sample is
positive but statistically insignificant throughout the five-year horizon after the onset of the
pandemic. In Figure 6, we look at the effect differentiated by the pandemic severity. For the
countries hit hardest by the pandemics, the pandemic-induced transition to renewable energy
use reaches 9.5% (compared to the unaffected countries) in the third year since the onset of the
pandemic and becomes statistically significant at the 10% level. However, soon after that, the
effect becomes smaller and insignificant. On the other hand, we do not find a positive impact
of pandemics in the medium-severity group of countries, while in the case of low-severity ones
we observe a negative transitory impact in the fourth year after the start of the pandemics.
Overall, we find some evidence that in the short run the countries hit hard by the past pandemics

8

have increased their share of electricity generated from renewable sources. However, this effect
does not appear in countries that experienced relatively moderate or small health crises.
Figure 5. The effect of past pandemics on the share of electricity from renewables (EIA data,
1980-2018)

Note: Figure shows estimates of IRFs based on LPs (see equation 1). The dependent variable is the change in the
logarithm of the share of electricity generated from renewable sources. See section 3 for a description of the model
specification. Shaded areas are 95% confidence intervals. The vertical axis shows years (k) after the start of the
pandemic event with k = 0 denoting the year when the pandemic started. The sample covers 174 countries over
the 1980-2018 period. Full regression results are available in Table A10 in the Appendix.

We also check whether the impact of past pandemics on the transition to clean energy was
different in the OECD versus lower-income countries (Figure 7). The effect for the OECD
countries is larger than that for all countries and becomes statistically significant in the first and
the fifth year after the onset of the pandemic. In those years, the previous pandemics increased
the share of electricity generated from renewable sources in the OECD countries by 6-7% relative to the countries unaffected by the pandemics. Since the average share of electricity generated from clean sources in the OECD countries in our sample is 32.3%, the past pandemics
increased the share on average by 1.9-2.3 percentage points within the five-year horizon. The
magnitude of the effect is therefore quite substantial and suggests that the rich countries took
the opportunity created by the pandemic crises to speed up the transition to clean energy use, at
least in the short run.10 Unfortunately, we do not observe significant effects of pandemics on
the transition to clean energy in lower-income countries. Finally, Figure 8 looks at the role of
business cycle conditions at the start of the pandemic episodes. It shows that during the periods
of economic expansion the transition to renewable energy seems to be in general negligible. On
the other hand, in bad economic times, we observe the consistently positive impact of the pandemics on the increase in the share of electricity generated from renewable sources. In the first
and the fifth year since the onset of previous pandemic events, the effects are statistically significant and vary in the range from 10% to 12%.11

10

The effects for the OECD countries in the longer horizon of 10 years are also positive, but less precisely estimated and statistically insignificant (details are available upon request).
11
For an average country, this translates into 3.2-3.9 percentage points increase of the electricity share generated
from renewables.

Overall, the evidence in Figures 6-8 is consistent and implies that the effect of previous
pandemics on the transition to renewable energy use is heterogenous across groups of countries.
In particular, we found significant effects in the countries hit hard by the pandemics, in the
OECD countries, and in countries that experienced low economic growth at the start of the
pandemic episodes. The reverse is true in countries that experienced pandemics of moderate or
low severity, in lower-income countries, and in countries hit during good economic times. With
our data, we are unable to test for the mechanisms that facilitated the energy transition in the
groups of countries that we identified. However, it seems obvious that, in general, the rich
countries have a higher capacity for the green transition in terms of the institutional framework,
political attitudes of citizens, infrastructure and fiscal space. More revealingly, our analysis
shows that the opportunity for energy transition arises during particularly hard health crises and
bad economic times. Under these circumstances, the overall electricity demand is often reduced
which facilitates energy transition, especially when a country is already producing a large share
of its electricity from renewables and when the crisis occurs during favourable weather conditions.
Although it is not straightforward to adapt lessons from past pandemic episodes for the
current one, we nevertheless notice that there is already some evidence suggesting that the
COVID-19 pandemic may be an instigator for a successful energy transition, at least in the
advanced countries. It has been shown that in Germany the share of electricity generated from
renewables grew above 55% in the first half of 2020 (as compared to 47% in 2019) without any
changes to the security of electricity supply or grid stability [8]. Electricity generation from
intermittent renewables increased as well in many other European countries [9]. However, to
ensure the sustainability and resilience of energy systems that rely more heavily on renewable
11

sources countries must strengthen their system flexibility to match the energy demand with
relatively more variable electricity supply from renewables [27]. On the other hand, as argued
in [10] the worldwide economic recession caused by COVID-19 could lead to a reduction of
investment in clean energy technologies and outweigh in the longer run any gains associated
with the early increased use of renewables. Ultimately, the overall effect of COVID-19 on the
energy transition will depend on government responses [7]. While it is too early to draw any
firm conclusions, it seems that the early developments are encouraging. As much as 30% of the
1.8 trillion Euro post-COVID stimulus adopted by the European Union targets climate protection [28,29]. This most ambitious EU climate policy to date aims at spending around 0.55% of
the EU GDP per year over 2021-2027, which would be consistent with the Paris Agreement
objectives. Several individual European countries and some East Asian counties have also invested heavily in a green recovery [28,29]. In the United States, President Biden recently proposed the American Jobs Plan – an eight-year, 2 trillion USD investment package that is expected to allocate at least 1 trillion USD to the sectors related to clean energy, green infrastructure and environmental justice [30]. As noted optimistically in [31], even a small fraction of the
total COVID-19 economic recovery packages announced by the governments around the globe
could put the world on track to meet the Paris Agreement goals. However, the green stimulus
packages currently implemented are short-term policies, while the successful transition to lowcarbon technologies seems to require investment efforts in green technologies thaw would span
several decades [32]. Moreover, green investment policies should be complemented by carbon
pricing and subsidies for clean technology development and adoption. Therefore, while there is
some promising early evidence, the long-run effect of COVID-19 on energy transition is surrounded by many uncertainties.
5. Conclusions
The COVD-19 pandemic has been a major shock that has drastically affected energy demand,
CO2 emissions and electricity systems around the world. The question of how emissions and
renewable energy use will be affected in the long run by the pandemic is of paramount importance. In this paper, we attempt to illuminate this issue by looking at the empirical evidence
from the past pandemic episodes. We used data on the six major pandemic crises that occurred
between 1968 and 2016 and the local projection method that allows estimating the impulse
responses of emissions and renewables’ use to the pandemic shocks. Our results show that the
previous pandemics led on average to the 3.4-3.7% fall in the CO2 emissions in the short-run
(1-2 years since the start of the pandemic). The effect is present only in the rich countries, as
well as in countries with the highest pandemic death toll (where the effect disappears only after
8 years) and in countries that were hit by the pandemic during economic recessions. We found
similar heterogeneity concerning the impact of past pandemics on the share of electricity generated from renewable sources. While on average we did not find a statistically significant impact, the effect is present for the OECD countries for which the past pandemics seem to increase
the renewables’ share of electricity by 1.9-2.3 percentage points within the five-year horizon.
The previous pandemics have also increased the share of electricity generated from renewables
in case of countries hit during bad economic times.
Overall, our results show that the past pandemics have significantly reduced CO2 emissions and accelerated the energy transition in the short- to medium run in the countries with the
highest pandemic-related mortality, in the OECD countries, and in countries that experienced
economic recession at the onset of the pandemic episodes. This suggests that pandemics create
opportunities for green energy transitions. However, the sustainability of such a transition crucially depends on the determined and long-term government policy securing the required investment level in clean energy technologies during and after the pandemic episodes.
