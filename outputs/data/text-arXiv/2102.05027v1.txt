ABSTRACT
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ) on Earth today has biogenic and anthropogenic sources. During the COVID19 pandemic, observations of global NO2 emissions have shown significant decrease in urban areas.
Drawing upon this example of NO2 as an industrial byproduct, we use a one-dimensional photochemical model and synthetic spectral generator to assess the detectability of NO2 as an atmospheric
technosignature on exoplanets. We consider cases of an Earth-like planet around Sun-like, K-dwarf
and M-dwarf stars. We find that NO2 concentrations increase on planets around cooler stars due to
less short-wavelength photons that can photolyze NO2 . In cloud-free results, present Earth-level NO2
on an Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star at 10pc can be detected with SNR ∼ 5 within ∼ 400
hours with a 15 meter LUVOIR-like telescope when observed in the 0.2 − 0.7µm range where NO2 has
a strong absorption. However, clouds and aerosols can reduce the detectability and could mimic the
NO2 feature. Historically, global NO2 levels were 3x higher, indicating the capability of detecting a
40-year old Earth-level civilization. Transit and direct imaging observations to detect infrared spectral
signatures of NO2 on habitable planets around M-dwarfs would need several 100s of hours of observation time, both due to weaker NO2 absorption in this region, and also because of masking features
by dominant H2 O and CO2 bands in the infrared part of the spectrum. Non-detection at these levels
could be used to place upper limits on the prevalence of NO2 as a technosignature.

1. INTRODUCTION

Over the last 25 years, more than 4000 exoplanets have been discovered1 from both ground and space-based surveys.
We are now entering into an era of exoplanet atmospheric characterization, with the soon to be launched James Webb
Space Telescope (JWST), Atmospheric Remote-sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large-survey (ARIEL) space telescope,
and large ground-based observatories such as the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), the Thirty Meter
Telescope (TMT), and the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT). The first detection of an exoplanet atmosphere was on
a gas giant planet, HD 209458b, in 2001 (Charbonneau et al. 2002). Since then, atmospheres have been detected
on exoplanets spanning a wide range of planetary parameter space, and observers are continuing to push the limits
towards smaller worlds (Tsiaras et al. 2019; Benneke et al. 2019). The ongoing discovery of exoplanet atmospheres has
raised the prospect of eventually identifying potentially habitable planets, as well as the possibility of finding one that

may also be inhabited. As a result, the characterization and detection of “biosignatures,”—remote observations of
atmospheric spectral features that could potentially indicate signs of life on an exoplanet—has received recent attention
as an area of priority for astrobiology2 (Seager et al. 2012; Kaltenegger 2017; Schwieterman et al. 2018; Meadows et al.
2018; Catling et al. 2018; Walker et al. 2018; Fujii et al. 2018; O’Malley-James & Kaltenegger 2019; Lammer et al.
2019; Grenfell 2017).
Similar to biosignatures, “technosignatures” refer to any observational manifestations of extraterrestrial technology
that could be detected or inferred through astronomical searches. As discussed in the 2018 NASA technosignatures
workshop report (Technosignatures Workshop Participants 2018): “Searches for technosignatures are logically continuous with the search for biosignatures as part of astrobiology. As with biosignatures, one must proceed by hypothesizing
a class of detectable technosignatures, motivated by life on Earth, and then designing a search for that technosignature considering both its detectability and its uniqueness.” Although the science of atmospheric technosignatures is
less developed compared to atmospheric biosignatures, a wide class of possible technosignatures have been suggested
in the literature that include waste heat (Dyson 1960; Wright et al. 2014; Kuhn & Berdyugina 2015; Carrigan Jr.
2009), artificial illumination (Schneider 2010; Loeb & Turner 2012; Kipping & Teachey 2016), artificial atmospheric
constituents (Schneider 2010; Lin et al. 2014; Stevens et al. 2016), artificial surface constituents (Lingam & Loeb 2017),
stellar “pollution” (Shklovskii & Sagan 1966; Whitmire & Wright 1980; Stevens et al. 2016), non-terrestrial artifacts
(Bracewell 1960; Freitas Jr & Valdes 1980; Rose & Wright 2004; Haqq-Misra & Kopparapu 2012), and megastructures
(Dyson 1960; Arnold 2005; Forgan 2013; Wright et al. 2016). This breadth of topics reflects the scope of possibilities
for detecting plausible technosignatures, although the sophistication of technosignature science remains in its infancy
compared to the rapidly evolving field of biosignatures (Wright 2019; Haqq-Misra et al. 2020).
The history of life on Earth provides a starting point in the search for biosignatures on exoplanets (Krissansen-Totton
et al. 2018; Pallé 2018), with the various stages of Earth’s evolution through the Hadean (4.6 -4 Gyr), Archean (4 - 2.5
Gyr), Proterozoic (2.5 - 0.54 Gyr), and Phanerozoic (0.54 Gyr - present) eons representing atmospheric compositions
to use as examples of spectral signatures of an inhabited planet. The use of Earth’s history as an example does not
imply that these biosignatures will necessarily be the most prevalent in the galaxy, but instead this approach simply
represents a place to begin based on the one known example of life. By extension, the search for technosignatures
likewise can consider Earth’s evolution into the Anthropocene epoch (Crutzen 2006; Lewis & Maslin 2015; Frank et al.
2017) as a template for future observing campaigns that seek to detect evidence of extraterrestrial technology. For
instance, Lin et al. (2014) discussed the possibility of detecting tetrafluoromethane (CF4 ) and trichlorofluoromethane
(CCl3 F) signatures in the atmospheres of transiting Earth-like planets around white dwarfs with JWST, which could
be detectable if these compounds are present at 10 times the present Earth level. These chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
are produced by industrial processes on Earth, so their detection in an exoplanet atmosphere could be strong evidence
for the presence of extraterrestrial technology. This approach does not insist that CFCs or other industrial gases
found on Earth will necessarily be the most prevalent technosignature in the galaxy, but it represents a place to begin
defining observables and plausible concepts for technosignatures based upon the one known example of technological
civilization.
In this study, we explore the possibility of NO2 as an atmospheric technosignature. Some NO2 on Earth is produced
as a byproduct of combustion, which suggests the possibility of scenarios in which larger-scale production of NO2
is sustained by more advanced technology on another planet. Detecting high levels of NO2 at levels above that of
non-technological emissions found on Earth could be a sign that the planet may host active industrial processes. In
section 2, we describe the production reactions of NO2 and use a 1-dimensional photochemical model to obtain selfconsistent mixing ratio profiles of nitrogen oxide compounds, on a planet orbiting a Sun-like star, a K6V spectral type
(Tef f = 4600K), and the two M-dwarf stars AD Leo (Tef f = 3390K) and Proxima Centauri (Tef f = 3000K). Using
these photochemical results, in section 3 we calculate the observability of strongest NO2 features between 0.2 − 0.7µm
and between 1−10µm using a spectral generation model to produce geometric albedo and transit spectra of planets with
various facilities like LUVOIR-15m, JWST and OST. In section 4, we discuss the implications of these observations,
concluding in section 5.

Nitrogen Dioxide Pollution as a Signature of Extraterrestrial Technology

Nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2 ) are among the main pollutants in industrialized locations on the globe. The
non-anthropogenic pathways for the production of NOx can be either due to emission from soils and wildfires, or
produced in the troposphere by lightning.3 The primary biogenic source of NOx is bacteria in soil through nitrification
(i.e bacteria converting ammonia to nitrite and nitrate compounds), or dentrification (process of reducing nitrate and
nitrite to gaseous forms of nitrogen such as N2 or N2 O). The estimated worldwide biogenic and lightning emissions
of NOx compounds are ∼ 10.6 Tera gram per year as N (Tg(N) yr−1 , (Table 1, Holmes et al. (2013)). Lightning
contributes about 5 Tg(N) yr−1 , which translates to 6 × 108 NO molecules/cm2 /s (Harman et al. 2018).
On the other hand, NOx compounds are also emitted from anthropogenic sources of combustion processes such as
vehicle emissions and fossil-fueled power plants. The role of this industrial production was noted during the COVID-19
pandemic, when global concentrations of NO2 were observed to decrease between 20 − 40% over urban areas (Bauwens
et al. 2020). Indeed, these emissions dominate the production of NOx compounds in the troposphere more than the
biogenic sources with an estimated rate of 32 Tg(N) yr−1 (Holmes et al. 2013). NO2 poses harmful health effects that
could cause impairment of lung function and respiratory problems (Faustini et al. 2014a). Typical concentrations of
NO2 range from 0.01 ppb (parts per billion) to ∼ 5 ppb depending upon the urbanization with the higher number
correlating to urban areas (Lamsal et al. 2013). The presence of NOx in the lower troposphere leads to a complex
chemistry that results in the formation of ozone (O3 ), which is a harmful pollutant in the troposphere and a greenhouse
gas. NOx mixing ratios in excess of 10−7 would cause severe damage to the O3 layer and could result in either a climatic
warming or cooling, depending upon the amount of NO2 present (Kasting & Ackerman 1985).
The sinks and sources for NO2 in the troposphere (≤ 20km) are governed by the following reactions. NO2 photolysis
is dominant in the wavelength range of 290 − 420nm (See Kraus & Hofzumahaus (1998), Fig. 2). The lower limit is set
by the available solar UV-intensity and the upper wavelength limit is determined by the fall-off in the photodissociation
cross-section. This NO2 photolysis produces ground state atomic oxygen, O(3 P), along with NO:
NO2 + hν(< 420nm) → O(3 P) + NO.

(1)

The O(3 P) then can combine with an oxygen molecule to form ozone,
O(3 P) + O2 + M → O3 + M,

(2)

which gets destroyed by reoxidizing nitric oxide to nitrogen dioxide:
NO + O3 → NO2 + O2 .

(3)

NO also reacts with atomic oxygen (O) and the hydroperoxy radical (HO2 ) to generate NO2 ,
NO + O + M → NO2 + M
NO + HO2 → NO2 + OH.

(4)
(5)

However, these production mechanisms of NO2 are counteracted when NO2 reacts again with atomic oxygen to recreate
NO:
NO2 + O → NO + O2 ,

(6)

The above reactions just cycle between NO and NO2 , so NOx is conserved. However, NO2 also reacts with the OH
radical to form nitric acid (HNO3 ), which eventually is removed from the atmosphere by rainout, which is a loss
process for NOx:
NO2 + OH + M → HNO3 + M.

(7)

Reactions 3 and 6 form a catalytic cycle to destroy ozone with the net reaction,
O3 + O → 2O2

The troposphere is the lowermost atmospheric layer from the surface up to 10-18 km, highest at the tropics and lowest near the poles
during winter. The pressure and temperature decrease with altitude, with global averages of 289 K and 1.013 millibar (mb) at the surface,
and around 210K and 150 mb at a height of 15 km.

indicating that high stratospheric NOx can lead to ozone depletion.
To study the steady-state abundances of NOx compounds in Earth-like atmospheres, we used a 1-D photochemical
model (described in Arney et al. 2016; Arney 2019), which is part of a coupled climate-photochemistry model called
‘Atmos.’4 The photochemical model is originally based on the one described in Kasting et al. (1979) and has been
updated extensively over the years and applied to various planetary and exoplanetary conditions (e.g. Segura et al.
2005; Kopparapu et al. 2012; Domagal-Goldman et al. 2014; Harman et al. 2015, 2018; Lincowski et al. 2018). The
model version used here has been updated to correct the deficiencies identified in Ranjan et al. (2020), and the public
version of the model is planned to be updated. This model solves a set of nonlinear, coupled ordinary differential
equations for the mixing ratios of all species at all heights using the reverse Euler method. The method is first order in
time and uses second-order centered finite differences in space. The vertical grid has 200 altitude levels, ranging from
0 km (lower boundary) to 100 km (upper boundary). The version used here includes updates described in Lincowski
et al. (2018) and includes 72 chemical species involved in 309 reactions to represent a modern Earth-like planet. We
considered a Sun-like star, a K6V stellar spectral type, and two M-stars (AD Leo and Proxima Centauri) in this study.
For the Sun-like star we used the Chance & Kurucz (2010) model; for the K6V star, we used the spectrum of HD 85512
from the Measurements of the Ultraviolet Spectral Characteristics of Low-mass Exoplanetary Systems (MUSCLES)
treasury survey (France et al. 2016; Loyd et al. 2016; Youngblood et al. 2016); for AD Leo and Proxima Centauri,
we used stellar spectra described in Segura et al. (2005) and Meadows et al. (2018), respectively. Planets around the
other stars are placed at the Earth-equivalent flux distance.
For each Earth-like planet around its host star, we ran the model to steady state to obtain the mixing ratio profiles
of all gaseous species, including NO2 . We have used a surface NO2 molecular flux of 8.64 × 109 molecules/cm2 /s as
the standard Earth-level (1x) flux in our simulations. This number comes from converting the estimated rate of 32
Tg(N) yr−1 anthropogenic NOx compound emissions in the troposphere5 to the molecular flux. We also include a fixed
biogenic flux of NO as 1.0 × 109 molecules/cm2 /s, kept constant across all simulations. Because we do not increase
the flux of NO alongside NO2 , our simulations may be regarded as somewhat conservative. Other fixed boundary
conditions of N-bearing species include: a flux of 1.53 × 109 for N2 O, a mixing ratio of 0.78 for N2 , and fixed deposition
velocities of 2.1 × 10−1 for HO2 NO2 and HNO3 .
Results from our 1-D photochemical model are shown in Fig. 1, panel (a). This plot shows the NO2 volume mixing
ratio profiles of an Earth-like planet around four stellar spectral types we considered in this study: the Sun (blue), AD
Leo (green), Proxima Centauri (black) and the K6V star (magenta). Two end member concentrations are shown: The
standard Earth level flux of 8.64 × 109 molecules/cm−2 /s (1x, solid curves), and a flux of 172 × 109 molecules/cm−2 /s
(20x, dashed curves). The corresponding stellar spectra are shown in the right panel (b), highlighting the wavelength
region of strongest NO2 absorption. As shown in this figure, the hotter stars provide more photons between 0.25 to
0.65 µm, which increases the rate of NO2 photolysis (Eq. 1, and also Table 1).
However, photolysis is not the only important factor . As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2, O3 also plays a major role
in determining NO2 concentration. Panel (a) in Fig. 2 shows the O3 mixing ratio profiles for various stars. For the
Sun (blue), the O3 concentration increases rapidly below ∼ 20 km compared to other stars. O3 participates in the
dominant production reaction for NO2 , with the help of NO as shown in Table 1. Ideally, this should increase the
concentration of NO2 below 20 km. However, as shown in panel (b) of Fig. 2, photolysis of NO2 due to photons of
wavelengths between 0.29 − 0.42µm that penetrate into the troposphere dominate the destruction of NO2 , decreasing
its mixing ratio (See Fig. 1, panel a). While the photolysis rates generally increase for all stars below 20 km as shown
in panel b of Fig. 2, it is the rate at which O3 increases below this altitude that determines the slope of decrease in
NO2 in the troposphere for planets around different stars. While the rapid increase in O3 is mostly negated by the
rapid photolysis and consequent decrease of NO2 below ∼ 20km for Sun-like stars (blue solid in Figs. 1 and 2), for
other stars the O3 concentration increases only a little from the surface to the tropopause (black, green and magenta
curves in Fig. 2). Consequently, the increasing slope of photolysis rate of NO2 below ∼ 20 km for these other stars
slightly dominates (panel b), resulting in a larger decrease in the mixing ratio of NO2 compared to a Sun-like star
(panel a in Fig. 1).
As a result, the column integrated NO2 abundance increases moving from hotter stars to cooler stars (Table 2). The
absorption cross sections for NO2 and other key gases are shown in Fig. 3. A Sun-like star produces more photons at

Figure 1. (a): Mixing ratio profiles of NO2 around stars of different spectral types on an Earth-like planet with 1x (solid)
and 20x (dashed) present Earth NO2 fluxes. Below the troposphere (∼ 20km), NO2 concentration is higher on planets around
cooler stars compared to the Sun because the destruction of NO2 is an order of magnitude more efficient around a Sun-like star
due to the availability of photons of wavelength between 0.29 − 0.42µm that penetrate to the troposphere. See inset in panel

wavelengths where NO2 is photolyzed (between 290 − 420nm), so the photolysis rates of NO2 is higher for the planet
around the Sun than for a planet around a cooler star (Table 1).
The result of all the dominant production and destruction reactions discussed above is that NO and NO2 decrease
with altitude until ∼ 20 km, into the stratosphere. In the stratosphere, ozone can generate NO2 with reactions
with NO; ozone’s overlapping UV cross section with NO2 also provides some UV shielding. At higher altitudes,
above the ozone layer, photochemical processes, including NO2 photolysis and reaction with OH radicals, draw down
abundances. These reactions occur most markedly for the planet orbiting the Sun; NO2 photolysis proceeds 1-2 orders
of magnitude faster around the Sun compared to around the cooler stars. Reaction of NO2 with OH to form HNO3
occurs two orders of magnitude more efficiently around the Sun compared to the K6V star, and fully 4-6 orders of
magnitude more efficiently around the Sun compared to the M dwarfs.
It is important to note that placing constraints on a planet’s NO2 abundance from its spectrum would not definitively
answer whether the NO2 is biologically or abiotically produced. One would need to estimate the production rates
required to produce the observed NO2 abundance and evaluate whether abiotic sources alone can sustain the inferred
production rate.

Figure 2. (a): Mixing ratio profiles of O3 around stars of different spectral types on an Earth-like planet with 1x (solid)
and 20x (dashed) present Earth fluxes of NO2 . Below the troposphere (∼< 20km), O3 concentration rapidly increases around
a Sun-like star (blue) compared to other star types. Because O3 is a dominant production mechanism for NO2 (See Table 1),
the concentration of NO2 ideally should increase. (b) However, as shown in this panel, the photolysis rate of NO2 increases
from the ground to up to 10km - 20km for all star types, as photons of wavelength between 0.29 − 0.42µm penetrate into the
troposphere. Consequently NO2 mixing ratio decreases between ∼ 10 − 20km (See Fig. 1). Higher than 20km altitude, O3
dominates the photolysis rate (because NO2 photolysis is not increasing anymore), and as a result, NO2 mixing ratio increases
as well.

The absorption cross section of NO2 shows a broad absorption between 0.25-0.6 µm, which has little overlap with
absorption from other terrestrial molecular atmospheric constituents (Fig. 3, panel b). The main possible confusion
would be related to aerosols with sub-micron sizes (∼ 0.5 µm), which have absorption features that could mimic the
exact same shape as NO2 . Considering the broad nature of the NO2 spectral feature, a unique spectroscopic identification will be therefore ultimately challenging, and this investigation solely explores the hypothetical requirements for
a possible detection for an absorption due to NO2 . Other absorption features are also present at ∼ 3.5 µm, 6.4 µm and
10 − 16 µm, but these overlap with absorption bands from H2 O, CO2 , and other species (Fig. 3, panel b). In order
to assess the detectability of NO2 as a technosignature, we use the mixing ratio profiles from the 1-D photochemical
model as input to the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG6 , Villanueva et al. (2018)) to simulate reflected light, and
transit spectra. We estimate the signal-to-noise (SNR) of detecting NO2 features. PSG is an online radiative transfer
suite that integrates the latest radiative transfer methods and spectroscopic parameterizations, and includes a realistic
treatment of multiple scattering in layer-by-layer spherical geometry. It can synthesize planetary spectra (atmospheres
and surfaces) for a broad range of wavelengths for any given observatory.

molecule in producing NO2 , because short wavelength photons are available more around a Sun-like star than a K or M-dwarf
star. This results in higher photolysis rate (destruction) of NO2 around a Sun-like star (see Table 1) reducing it’s abundance .

We performed simulations with PSG to generate reflected light spectra (Fig. 4) of planets around Sun-like star and
a K-dwarf star. We then calculated required SNR to detect the NO2 feature (Fig. 5) between 0.2- 0.7 µm. For these
simulations, we assumed a LUVOIR-A like telescope (15 meter) observing with the ECLIPS (Extreme Coronagraph
for LIving Planetary Systems).7 This instrument is an internal coronagraph with the key goal of direct exoplanet
observations. It has three channels: NUV (0.2–0.525 µm), visible (0.515–1.030 µm) and NIR (1.0–2.0 µm). The NUV
channel is capable of high-contrast imaging only, with an effective spectral resolution of R∼ 7. The optical channel
contains an imaging camera and integral field spectrograph (IFS) with R=140. For our spectral simulations, we use
NUV (R=6) and visible (R=70) channels, as the NO2 cross section spans from UV into visible wavelengths (See Fig.
3). Because the NO2 feature is quite broad in the NUV to visible region, a low resolution of R=6 and R=70 is suffice
to resolve the feature, at the same time maximizing the SNR. We calculated wavelength dependent SNR shown in
Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 as the difference between the spectra with and without the NO2 feature, divided by the noise

Figure 3. NO2 absorption cross section as a function of wavelength (panel a). The broad absorption between 0.25-0.6 µm is
the dominant feature, and few other molecules absorb here. The inset figure focuses on the cross section in this wavelength
region. Other features in the IR region (∼ 3.5 µm, 6.4 µm and 10 − 16 µm) are relatively weaker and overlap with absorption
from other gas species, in particular H2 O and CO2 (panel b).

simulated by PSG for the instrument under consideration (see section 5.3 of Villanueva et al. (2018), and also the
PSG website8 where the noise model is discussed in detail). The “net SNR” is calculated by summing the squares
of the individual SNRs at each wavelength within a given band (either NUV or VIS), and then taking the square
root. This methodology is largely insensitive to SNR, as long as the feature is resolved by the spectrum. See also
Appendix A for a comparison between the PSG coronagraph noise model and a complementary noise model (Robinson
et al. 2016; Lustig-Yaeger et al. 2019), showing highly comparable results for the photon count rates and resulting
spectral precision. We considered the planets around both the Sun-like and K6V stars to be located at 10 pc distance,
residing in the respective habitable zones (HZs) of their host stars as calculated from Kopparapu et al. (2013, 2014),
and observed at a phase angle of 45◦ (0◦ is secondary eclipse, and 180◦ is transit). For this feature to be detected, the
planet need not be in the HZ, as will be explained later in the discussion section (4).
In both the panels of Fig. 4, the difference of the geometric albedo spectrum with and without NO2 are shown for
different levels scaled by factors of current Earth levels in a 10 hour observation with LUVOIR-15m telescope. The
corresponding noise is shown as dashed curve. For the Sun-like star (panel a) even very high (20x) concentrations of
NO2 compared to the present Earth levels barely reach the 1 − σ noise level in the strongest wavelength region. In
panel b, increasing the nominal abundance to higher concentrations on a planet around a K-dwarf produces only a
marginal improvement over a Sun-like star, with the highest concentration (20x) reaching just above the noise level.
This is likely because the column number density of NO2 on a planet around K-dwarf star seems marginally larger

Figure 4. Geometric Albedo difference with and without NO2 for an Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star (panel a) and
around a K6V stellar spectral type (panel b) located at 10 pc with varying NO2 concentrations, assuming LUVOIR-A (15 m)
observing time of 10 hours. 1σ noise model is also shown (dashed black). The multiple factors in the legend are compared to
the concentrations of present Earth level of NO2 flux (8.64 ×109 molecules/cm2 /s) implemented in our photochemical model of
an Earth-like planet around each stellar type. These are cloud free model results.

(Table 2) due to less photolysis rate (last row, Table 1). As discussed above, the enhanced NO2 absorption on the
K-dwarf planet compared to the planet around the Sun-like star is driven by the photochemistry.
In Fig. 5, we show the calculated signal to noise ratio (SNR) values of the features shown in Fig. 4 as a function of
wavelength for 10 hour exposure times with a LUVOIR-A like telescope for wavelengths relevant to the NO2 feature.
The “net SNR” indicated in these figures is calculated by summing up the squares of the SNR from each wavelength
band and then taking the square-root (see Eq.(6) of Lustig-Yaeger et al. (2019)). Fig. 5(a) shows that for planets
around Sun-like stars even an increase of 10x in the NO2 flux is not enough to detect the feature with any meaningful
SNR within 10 hours of observation. Any lower amount of NO2 would need even more longer observation times.
Fig. 5(b) shows SNR as a function of the same wavelength range for a planet around K-dwarf star. The combined
effects of more NO2 and better planet-star contrast ratio relative to the planet orbiting the Sun (a K6V dwarf is only
about one tenth as luminous as a G2V dwarf) makes only a marginal difference in SNR that can be reached in the
same time as Sun-like star.
While these SNR may not look promising, there is an interesting question that one can ask and explore an answer:
How much LUVOIR-15 m time is needed to detect present Earth-level concentration of NO2 around a Sun-like star
at 10 pc? Fig.6 (a) shows Geometric albedo spectrum difference with and without NO2 as a function of wavelength
for 300, 600 and 1200 hours of LUVOIR-A time, respectively. Also shown in dashed lines are the corresponding noise
levels for each of these observation times. The present Earth-level NO2 seems to be well above the noise level after 300
hours of observation time (compare the solid green curve with red-dashed line) indicating that it might be detectable.

Figure 5. Calculated SNR values to detect various levels of NO2 concentrations as a function of wavelength, around a Sun-like
star (panel a) and for a K6V spectral type star (panel b) located at 10 pc. The calculation assumed a LUVOIR-A (15m) type
telescope with 10 hour observation time. While these plots show that at any given wavelength, NO2 of any concentration is
detected comparatively at a higher SNR around a K6V star than a Sun-like star, it will still be challenging to detect the feature
within 10 hours. The NO2 concentrations are generally higher around the K-dwarf star compared to an Earth-like planet around
a Sun-like star, giving rise to this marginal increment in SNR around a K-dwarf star. These are cloud free model results.

To find out with what SNR it would be detectable, Fig. 6 (b) shows the “net SNR” to detect present Earth-level NO2
as a function of observation time. To achieve a net SNR of 5 (dashed red line), it would take LUVOIR-15 m about
400 hours. For comparison, to obtain the Hubble Ultra Deep Field image, ∼ 400 hours of actual observation time
(∼ 1 year in real time) was needed (Beckwith et al. 2006). In fact, Hubble has done even larger programs such as the
CANDLES galaxy evolution survey (Grogin et al. 2011) with 902 orbits (∼ 900 hours of observation time assuming
∼ 1 hour per orbit). This took about 3 years in real time. However, these large programs also obtained data on a huge
sample size with thousands of galaxies. LUVOIR is envisaged to be 100% community competed time and the final
report of LUVOIR team laid out a DRM in which comparable allocations of time were spent on general astrophysics
observations and exoplanet detection and characterization observations during the first 5 years of the mission. So,
over the course of the nominal LUVOIR mission lifetime of about 5 years, it may be possible to take data with ∼ 400
hour observation time on a prime HZ planet candidate(s) within 10 pc, to potentially obtain a SNR ∼ 5 for a present
Earth-level NO2 feature on a Earth-Sun system at 10 pc. An even more interesting aspect is that, we can place upper
limits on the amount of NO2 available on that planet as we spend more observation time on a prime HZ candidate.
This could potentially indicate the presence or absence or the level of technological civilization on that planet.

with LUVOIR-15m telescope to detect a present Earth-level NO2 amount on a Sun-Earth system at 10pc. (b) Integrated
SNR (over the wavelengths) versus the amount of observation time needed for the same system configuration. For example, to
detect an Earth level NO2 with SNR ∼ 5 (red-dashed line), LUVOIR-15m would need ∼ 400 hours of observation time. For
comparison, Hubble’s large programs such as the Ultra Deep Field (UDF) and CANDLES surveys used between ∼ 400 − 900
hours of observation time over a period of 1-3 years. See text for more details.

While the results from the previous section provide a preliminary study of NO2 as a potential technosignature,
some caveats need to be mentioned. First, we have performed 1-D photochemical model calculations using a modern
Earth template generated from a 1-D radiative-convective, cloud-free climate model from Kopparapu et al. (2013).
Clouds can significantly effect the observed spectrum and potentially alter the calculated SNR. To test this, we have
prescribed water-ice clouds (particle size 25µm) between 0.001 - 0.01bar, and liquid water clouds (particle size 14µm)
between 0.01bar - 0.1bar in PSG. Fig. 7 shows SNR as a function of wavelength for an Earth-like planet around a
Sun-like star at 10 pc distance observed with the LUVOIR-15m telescope for 10 hours with (blue solid) and without
(red solid) clouds. The absorption cross-sections of water and ice clouds are in the same wavelength region as the peak
NO2 absorption which further masks the NO2 feature in this band. We should caution that this is all based on ad-hoc
prescription of clouds at a certain height, and a more rigorous analysis using 3-D climate models which can simulate
self-consistent and time-varying cloud cover need to be performed. We leave that for future study.
Secondly, we have used the 15 m architecture of LUVOIR-A, and the SNR values we report are a best case scenario
owing to its large mirror size. Other telescope architectures such as LUVOIR-B (8 m) or HabEX9 (a 4 m mirror
accompanied by a coronagraph and a starshade) may need more observation time than shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 7 to
detect NO2 features.

Figure 7. Effect on the SNR of a geometric albedo spectrum with (blue solid) and without (red solid) clouds on an Earth-like
planet (1xNO2 ) around Sun-like star. Water clouds absorb in the same wavelength region as NO2 absorption bands, thus
reducing the SNR and potentially causing confusion source. (b) Similar to Fig.6b, integrated SNR (over the wavelengths) versus
the amount of observation time with (green dashed) and without (blue solid) clouds. The time to reach a SNR = 5 is slightly
longer with clouds.

As shown in Fig. 3, NO2 also absorbs in the infrared (IR) part of the spectrum, particularly between 3.2-3.7 µm,
5.2-8.9 µm and 9.7-18 µm. However, the absorption in these regions is either weak across the band compared to
the 0.25-0.65 µm visible band, or limited to a very narrow region of the spectrum. Consequently, detecting NO2 in
transit spectroscopy with either JWST or the flagship mission concept study Origins Space Telescope (OST) would
be challenging. Nevertheless, we tested this with PSG, and the results are shown in Fig. 8. We placed a planet like
Proxima Cen b around it’s host star at 10 pc assuming that it transits, with 20x NO2 abundance to maximize the
signal. We used JWST NIRSpec and OST MISC-Transit instrument for the ∼ 3 µm and ∼ 6 µm wavelength regions for
the detection of NO2 . While OST has greater performance than JWST, the observations here are limited by masking
features from H2 O and CO2 in the near-IR. Even at 20x NO2 from our photochemical model H2 O features completely
dominate the ∼ 6 µm region of NO2 absorption (Fig.8(a)). The SNR for a 10 hour and 500 hour observation times for
both telescopes is shown in Fig.8(b). Even with large observation times, it would be very challenging to detect the
NO2 feature with any meaningful SNR.
A space-based nulling interferometer such as ESA’s LIFE (Large Interferometer for Exoplanets) mission concept
(Defrère et al. 2018; Quanz et al. 2018) could potentially detect mid-IR (5 − 20µm) features in direct imaging spectra.
While we are unable to assess quantitative limits on SNR at this time for this mission, we speculate that phase
dependent thermal emission spectroscopy (Wolf et al. 2019; Suissa et al. 2020) may be another way to detect NO2
feature.

(red) observations. No clouds were included. The vertical solid black line indicates the error bar, and dashed lines indicate
NO2 absorption bands in the IR (b) Both 10 hour (dashed) and 500 hour (solid) observations indicate it is very challenging to
observe even 20x NO2 abundance in transit observations in the IR because of several other overlapping gases in this region that
have a stronger absorption than NO2 . See Fig. 3(b).

Historically, the United States NO2 concentrations have varied (gone down) by a factor of 3 over a period of 40
years, from 1980-2019.10 Therefore, we can expand the possibilities of detecting a technological civilization at the
stage where Earth civilization was 40 years ago. It is possible to imagine a more highly industrialized society that
could possibly operate in the regime of 5× Earth NO2 level making it possible to detect it with LUVOIR-15m with
even less observation time than for present-Earth conditions. We should stress here that when we mean a technological
civilization, it does not necessarily mean a much more advanced society than current Earth level. Just like the search
for biosignatures encompass ‘Earth-through time’ with different stages of Earth’s biosphere evolution, we could do a
similar search for a ‘technosphere’ at different stages of a technological civilization.
It is possible that atmospheric technosignatures, in particular industrial pollutants like NO2 , are short-lived. However, this is comparable to searches for radio technosignatures where the transient nature of the radio communicative
civilizations may also be short-lived. Furthermore, it may be that an industrialized society that is prone to emit NO2
as a byproduct of their combustion technology may also have radio communication capabilities, just like us. In this
respect, a search for radio technosignatures can be performed if NO2 is detected on a potential habitable planet.
If we are looking for NO2 as a technosignature, and not as a biosignature, then it may appear that one need not
limit the search to known planets in the HZ. A technological civilization can possibly inhabit even an adjacent barren

planet (like Mars in our Solar System), and use the atmosphere as a waste dump of NO2 emissions. Or they may
prefer to live sub-surface on a HZ planet and release “waste” NO2 into the atmosphere. Speculations are endless.
However, industrial NO2 on Earth is produced by essentially burning biomass (coal, petroleum products) that have
been excavated to fuel the civilization (We note that NO2 can also be produced by nuclear detonations.) The vast
majority of burnable organic matter is directly or indirectly derived from oxygenic photosynthesis, meaning an abiotic
or anoxic world would not have abundant preserved organic matter. To burn this biomass, one needs an atmosphere
with oxygen. The observation of high abundances of NO2 on an exoplanet atmosphere would indicate a sustained source
of industrial production, likely requiring an oxic atmosphere and indicating a significant source of biomass to sustain
long-term industrial activity. While NO2 can exist in abundant quantities on planets around K-dwarf stars, it may not
necessarily be a desirable thing for the inhabitants if they have biology similar to humans, because exposure to NO2
could cause impairment of lung function and/or recurrent respiratory problems (Faustini et al. 2014b). Conversely, if
extraterrestrial biology is sufficiently different from Earth life, then it could be impervious to NO2 toxicity. In this
respect, NO2 on K-dwarfs is similar to the likely accumulation of abiotic and biologically produced CO on Earth-like
planets orbiting mid-to-late M-dwarfs, in addition to the accumulation of biosignature gases (Schwieterman et al.
2019).
Missions like LUVOIR, HabEX, and OST may have biosignature targets as a priority, so it may be untenable to seek
dedicated observing time for exclusive technosignature detection. However, in the search for exo-Earth candidates, we
will undoubtedly detect other planets within the stellar system (Stark et al. 2014; Kopparapu et al. 2018). LUVOIR
and HabEX will be able to simultaneously obtain the spectra of the other bright planets in the system, while performing
their observations on a prime HZ target. Consequently, there may not be a need to schedule separate observation
time for technosignature detection, as such efforts could “piggy back” on a routine survey to observe both HZ and
non-HZ planets (Lingam & Loeb 2019). However, this assumes that the NO2 detection will likely occur within the
total integrated observational time spent on the prime HZ candidate for the biosignature detection, whereas Fig. 5
indicates lower NO2 abundances may require longer search times.

5. CONCLUSION

The presence of NO2 on Earth today results in part from sustained industrial processes in urban areas. This paper
suggests that the detection of NO2 in an exoplanet atmosphere could serve as a technosignature, as Earth-level biogenic
sources would be unable to generate detectable atmospheric abundances of NO2 . Using a 1-D photochemical model
that uses present Earth atmospheric temperature profile, we find that it would be challenging to detect Earth-level
NO2 around G and K-dwarf stars through direct imaging with only 10 hours of observation time. To detect present
Earth-level NO2 concentration with a SNR ∼ 5, it would take ∼ 400 hours of LUVOIR-15m telescope. Such large
programs may be possible considering several hundred hours of observing time spent on Hubble UDF and CANDLES
surveys. Historically, the United States NO2 emission varied (gone down) by roughly a factor of ∼ 3 over 40 years
from 1980-2019. Hence, there might be a possibility to detect 40-year old Earth-level industrialized society with even
less time. In this cloud free model, habitable planets orbiting K-dwarf stars, by comparison, would marginally need
less amount of time to detect present-day NO2 abundance. The advantage of searching K-dwarf planets has already
been noted in the search for biosignatures (Cuntz & Guinan 2016; Arney 2019), and our results indicate that K-dwarf
planets could similarly be advantageous when searching for technosignatures like NO2 .
However, when we prescribe water-ice and liquid water clouds, there is a moderate decrease in the SNR of the
geometric albedo spectrum from LUVOIR-15 m, with present Earth-level NO2 concentration on an Earth-like planet
around a Sun-like star at 10 pc. Clouds and aerosols can reduce the detectability and could mimic the NO2 feature, posing a challenge to the unique identification of this signature. This highlights the need for performing these
calculations with a 3-D climate model which can simulate variability of the cloud cover and atmospheric dynamics
self-consistently.
While NO2 absorbs even in the near-IR and mid-IR, we find that transit observations in this region with JWST
and OST may prove challenging to detect NO2 because of the weaker absorption and also due to overlapping gas
absorption of potent greenhouse gases such as H2 O, CO2 and CH4 .
Further work is needed to explore the detectability of NO2 on Earth-like planets around M-dwarfs in direct imaging
observations in the near-IR with ground-based 30 m class telescopes. NO2 concentrations increase on planets around
cooler stars due to reduced availability of short-wavelength photons that can photolyze NO2 . Non-detectability at

Nitrogen Dioxide Pollution as a Signature of Extraterrestrial Technology

longer observation times could place upper limits on the amount NO2 present on M-dwarf HZ planets like Prox Cen
b.
The serendipitous detection of NO2 , or any other potential artificial atmospheric spectral signature (CFCs, for
example) may become a watershed event in the search for life (biological or technological). Is it likely that biosignatures
are more prevalent than technosignatures? We will not know for certain until we search. Our aim in this study is to
point out that both biosignatures and technosignatures are two sides of the same coin, and the search for both can
co-exist together with upcoming observatories. It is worth pointing out the obvious in this concluding statement: the
question “Are we alone?”—which has been the driving force behind the search for extraterrestrial biosignatures—is a
question posed by a technological civilization.

A. COMPARISON OF LUVOIR NOISE MODELS

We conducted a comparison between the LUVOIR coronagraph noise model included in PSG and the Python
implementation of the Robinson et al. (2016) coronagraph noise model from Lustig-Yaeger et al. (2019) (henceforth
CG). We found the two models to agree very well (Figure 10), with both models implementing very similar formalisms
for computing sensitivities.
We define the end-to-end throughput for the planetary fluxes as: Ttotal = TT ele ×Tcor ×Topt ×Tread ×TQE , where TT ele
accounts for light lost due to contamination and inefficiencies in the main collecting area, Tcor is the coronagraphic
throughput at this planet-star separation, Topt is the optical throughput (the transmissivity of all optics), TQE is the
raw quantum efficiency (QE) of the detector, and Tread is the read-out efficiencies. The left panel in Figure 9 shows the
optical throughput (Topt ) from Stark et al. (2019) and the right panel shows the coronagraph throughput as a function
of planet-star separation (Tcor ). Although the design of the LUVOIR-A coronagraph has multiple different masks
with slightly different IWAs, both coronagraph models use a combined mask (shown in Figure 9) to approximate the
optimal use of the coronagraph for any simulated target. Importantly, the coronagraph throughput already accounts
for the fraction of the exoplanetary light that falls within the photometric aperture, denoted fpa in Robinson et al.
(2016), so we manually set fpa = 1 in the CG model to properly account for this factor. The number of stellar
photons is defined by the contrast at the core throughput, and thus the number of stellar photons is calculated as
C · max(Tcor ) ≈ 10−10 · 0.27. For TT ele , we adopt 0.95 for all wavelengths, on par with the particulate coverage fraction
for JWST’s mirrors. EMCCD detectors are expected to have Tread near 0.75 (Stark et al. 2019), while for NIR and
other detectors, read-out inefficiencies and bad-pixels may account to a similar value, and we adopt Tread =0.75 across
all detectors as a conservative estimate. The reported quantum efficiency of the different detectors ranges from 0.6 to
0.9, yet technological improvements in several of these detectors could be expected in the near future, and we adopt
a general TQE =0.9 for all detectors.
The Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) is effectively defined by the different sources of noise, quantified as count rates.
We not only compared resulting SNRs between the two models, but also the simulated count rates for the different

components, and found very good agreement (Figure 10). For these simulations, we assumed a circular aperture
defined by diffraction (1.22 λ/D), an exo-zodiacal level of 4.5 times the one of our solar system (22 mag/arcsec2 ), and
a local zodi level of 22.5 mag/arcsec2 . The noise term was computed as
p
Cnoise = Cp + Cs + 2Cb
(A1)
where Cp is the total number of planet photons, Cs is the stellar photon noise (e.g. “leakage” through the coronagraph),
and Cb is the total background, which includes all other noise sources such as zodi, exozodi, dark current, thermal, and
read noise. Observations are normally performed as on-off, meaning one with the planet, and one without. As such,
the background sources of noise need to be counted twice (equation A1). Depending on the observational procedure,
the stellar photons can be assumed to be present in the “off” position or not. Robinson et al. (2016) assumes by default
that the star is also in the “off” position, and therefore doubles Cs , while the default in PSG is the “off” position
without star leakage (so only counted once, equation A1). We explored the impact on the SNR of this assumption in
the observational procedure, and only observe small (<10%) differences in the resulting SNR (Figure 10).
