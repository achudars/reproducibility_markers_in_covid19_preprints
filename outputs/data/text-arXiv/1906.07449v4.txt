Abstract
We analyze an epidemic model on a network consisting of susceptible-infectedrecovered equations at the nodes coupled by diffusion using a graph Laplacian.
We introduce an epidemic criterion and examine different isolation strategies:
we prove that it is most effective to isolate a node of highest degree. The model
is also useful to evaluate deconfinement scenarios and prevent a so-called second wave. The model has few parameters enabling fitting to the data and the
essential ingredient of importation of infected; these features are particularly
important for the current COVID-19 epidemic.

Introduction

Many models of the propagation of an epidemic such as the current COVID-19 [1]
involve a network. This can be a contact network between individuals. Then, the network is oriented and is used to understand how a given individual can infect others

at the very early stages. The models are typically probabilistic, see [2] for example. Once the epidemic is established, the geographical network becomes important.
There, nodes represent locations and edges the means of communication; for COVID19 these are the airline routes [3]. Such a network is non oriented and the important
nodes are the ones that are most connected.
One of simplest models of a disease is the Kermack-McKendrick system of equations [4] involving three populations of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals
(S, I, R). Using this model together with a probability transition matrix [5] for the
geographic coupling, Brockman and Helbling [6] performed a remarkable study of the
propagation of well-known epidemics like SARS or H1N1 due to airline travel. They
emphasized that the fluxes between the nodes govern the propagation of the epidemic.
In this article, we consider (S, I, R) Kermack-McKendrick equations coupled to a
network through a graph Laplacian matrix [7]. The combination of the simple SIR
dynamics with the diffusion yields the essential ingredients to model and understand
an epidemic, such as the COVID-19. In particular,
• there are few parameters so that fitting to data can be successful,
• it contains the essential ingredient of importation of infected subjects from country to country.
The epidemic front is controlled by the availability of susceptibles. If susceptibles
are large enough, the front cannot be stopped. The number of susceptibles varies
from node to node. Reducing this number at a given location can be done through
isolation. This is expensive and cannot be done for the whole network. It is therefore
important to address the question: what nodes are more useful to isolate to mitigate
the epidemic?
Using this model together with the detailed data available [10] [11], we predicted
the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic in Mexico [3]. The present article is devoted
to the detailed analysis of the model. We first prove that it is well-posed and that
solutions remain positive. We introduce an epidemic criterion that generalizes the
well-known R0 of the scalar case. For small diffusion, nodes are almost decoupled and
an outbreak occurs at a node if the local R0 is larger than one. When the diffusion
is moderate, the epidemic criterion depends on the network and when there is an
outbreak, it starts synchronously on the network. Using this criterion, we define an
isolation policy. We find that it is most useful to isolate the high connectivity nodes
and not efficient to isolate neighbors. For the particular case of the COVID-19 we
discuss the effect of deconfining; the model shows that allowing circulation between
heavily and weakly infected areas will prolong the outbreak in the latter.
The article is organized as follows. In section 2, we introduce the model, discuss its
main features and present the epidemic criterion. Section 3 shows a simple six node
network based on the country of Mexico; there the effect of isolation is discussed. The
COVID-19 disease is studied in section 4 and we show the estimation of the time of
outbreak in Mexico. The important issue of deconfinement is studied in section 5.
We conclude in section 6.

The model and epidemic criterion

One of the main models to describe the time evolution of the outbreak of an epidemic
is the Kermack-McKendrick model [4]

 Ṡ = −βSI,
(1)
I˙ = βSI − γI

Ṙ = γI

where the dynamics of transmission depends of the frequency and intensity of the
interactions between (healthy) susceptible S and infected individuals I and produce
recovered individuals R. The parameters β and γ are the infection rate and the
recovery rate. The model conserves N = S + I + R the total number of individuals.
Note that R is essentially the integral of I and therefore plays no role in the dynamics.
We will omit it below and only discuss S and I.

An epidemic occurs if βS − γ > 0 [4]. At t = 0, S = 1 so that an infection occurs
if the infection factor defined as
β
R0 ≡ ,
(2)
γ
is greater than one. An important moment in the time evolution of S and I is when the
number of infected is maximum. The corresponding values (S ∗ , I ∗ ) can be calculated
easily; we give the derivation in the Appendix. The expressions are

The value of I ∗ depends also on the initial number of susceptibles S0 which is smaller
than the total number N . Generally, a large N gives a large S0 and I ∗ .

2.1

SIR on a network

We consider a geographic network of cities connected by roads or airline routes. This
introduces a spatial component so that (S, I) become vectors; we also drop R. This
is similar to Murray’s model where he introduces spatial dispersion in an SI model

where Nj is the population at node j, the k∼j is the exchange with the neighboring
nodes k of j and where ǫ is a constant. The main difference with the model of [6] is
that we assume symmetry in the exchanges.
The equations (5) can be written concisely as

Ṡ = ǫ∆S − βS I,
I˙ = ǫ∆I + βSI − γI.

(7)

where S = (S1 , S2 , . . . , Sn )T , I = (I1 , I2 , . . . , In )T , β ≡ (β/N1 , β/N2 , . . . , β/Nn )T ,
∆ is the graph Laplacian matrix [7] and we denote by SI the vector
(S1 I1 , S2 I2 , . . . , Sn In )T . The infection rate β can vary from one geographical site to
another while the recovery rate γ depends only on the disease. The diffusion ǫ should
be small so that the populations involved in that process remain much smaller than
the node populations Nj . Another point is that the diffusion could act only on the
infected population. We chose to put the diffusion on both S and I for symmetry
reasons.

The graph Laplacian ∆ is the real symmetric negative semi-definite matrix, defined

The graph Laplacian has important properties, see ref. [7], in particular it is a finite
difference approximation of the continuous Laplacian [8]. The eigenvalues of ∆ are
the n non positive real numbers ordered and denoted as follows:
0 = −ω12 ≥ −ω22 ≥ · · · ≥ −ωn2 .

(9)

The eigenvectors {v 1 , . . . , v n } satisfy
∆v j = −ωj2 v j .

(10)

and can be chosen to be orthonormal with respect to the scalar product in Rn , i.e.
v i · v j = δi,j where δi,j is the Kronecker symbol.

2.2

Well posedness and positivity

The model (7) is well posed in the sense that the solution remains bounded. We show
this in the Appendix using standard techniques.
4

The biological domain of the system is
Ω = {(S, I) : S ≥ 0; I ≥ 0}.
Let us show that Ω is an invariant set for (7) so that the model makes sense in
biology. Consider the different axes Sj = 0 and Ij = 0, j = 1, . . . n. First assume
Ij = 0, j = 1, . . . n, then equation (7) reduces to
Ṡ = ǫ∆S
which conserves the positivity of S. Similarly when S = 0, we get
I˙ = ǫ∆I − γI
and again the positivity of I is preserved.

2.3

Epidemic criterion

Here we extend the 1D epidemic criterion of Kermack-McKendrick [4] to our graph
model. Initially, the vector I will follow the second equation of (7)
I˙ = (ǫ∆ − γ)I + βSI.

(11)

Equation (11) describes the onset of the epidemic on the network. It can be
written
I˙ = M I
where M is the symmetric matrix
M = ǫ∆ − γIdn + diag(βS1 , βS2 , . . . , βSn ).

(12)

The eigenvalues of M σ1 , . . . , σn are real. If one of them is positive, then the solution
I(t) increases exponentially and the epidemic occurs. We can then write
Epidemic criterion : there is an onset of the epidemic if one eigenvalue σi of M
is positive.
Two situations occur, depending whether the diffusion is small or moderate. For
small diffusion, the contribution of ∆ to M can be neglected. Then each node will
develop independently from the others. We will have outbreaks in some and not in
others.
When the diffusion is moderate, the Laplacian contributes to M . Since M is
symmetric the eigenvalues of M remain in the same order as the ones of ∆. This is
the interlacing property [7]. Then σ1 will tend to 0 for γ, β → 0. Note also that since
k S k decreases with time, the estimate given by the eigenvalues of M indicates the
size of the epidemic i.e. max k I k. Then, the eigenvector of M for the eigenvalue σ1
will be almost constant and the epidemic will start synchronously on the network.

5

The analysis of the moderate diffusion case can be extended when β is constant.
Expanding I on an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors (v k ) of ∆
I=

γk v k ,

(13)

k=1

we get
γ̇k = (−ωk2 − γ)γk + < βSI|v k > .

(14)

Assume that the susceptible population is constant on the network. Then diag(S1 , S2 , . . . , Sn ) =
SIdn so that equation (16) reduces to
γ̇k = (−ωk2 − γ + βS)γk .

(15)

The epidemic starts if −γ + βS > 0 which is a simple generalization of the criterion
in the scalar case.
When the population of susceptibles is inhomogeneous and β is homogeneous, equation (14) becomes

γ̇k = (−ωk2 − γ)γk + β

Then the eigenvectors and the geometry of the network play a role.

A simple example

We illustrate the results given above on a 6 node network inspired by the geographical
map of Mexico, with six main cities surrounding Mexico city, see Fig. 1. A node
represents a city and an edge is a road link between two cities. For simplicity, here
we assume that Nj is independant of j so that I and S are given in percentages. This
will be the case throughout the article unless specified.

Influence of the diffusion

The variable ǫ measures the intensity of the diffusion of S and I on the network. When
ǫ << 1 the diffusion is very weak and the evolution at each node can be decoupled
from the one of its neighbors. For larger ǫ, the diffusion and reaction occur on similar
time periods and need to be analyzed together. To see the influence of the diffusion,
we plot in Fig. 2 the evolution of Ik (t), k = 1, . . . , 6 for ǫ = 0.1 (left panel) and
ǫ = 10−7 (right panel).

Note the times of arrival of the infection, first in node 5 the neighbor of node 6,
then nodes 1 and 4 and finally nodes 3 and 2. For the large diffusion (left panel of
Fig. 2) the peaks are very close and there is a strong influence between the nodes.
On the other hand for a small diffusion, the peaks are well separated and the nodes
are decoupled. The maximum of Ik is given by the estimate (4).
Infecting node 2 changes the time of arrival of the outbreak as shown in Fig. 3.
It reaches first nodes 1 and 3, then nodes 4 and 5 and finally node 6.

3.2

Isolation policies for large diffusion

We first consider that the diffusion and the nonlinear terms have similar orders of
magnitude. We will address the case of weak diffusion in the next section.
When the diffusion is large, one should consider the epidemic on the network as
a whole and use the topology of the network to reduce the strength of the outbreak.
From the amplitude equations (16), one can devise a strategy of isolation. By this we
mean reducing β so that the maximal eigenvalue of M is minimum.
We choose
ǫ = 1, β = 6.5, γ = 6.25.
Table 1 shows the eigenvalues σ1 , . . . , σn of M from (12) when isolating a node of
the network, i.e. setting Sj = 0 at a specific node j and keeping the other nodes the
same. We chose S = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)T .

In the absence of isolation, the largest eigenvalue of the matrix M is 2.5 10−1 .
The table shows that it is most effective to isolate nodes 1,3 and 5. These nodes have
the highest degree of the network.
We now isolate two cities in the network. The results are presented in table 3. We

Table 2: Isolated nodes i, j and associated eigenvalues of M .
Again the high degree nodes 1,3 and 5 are the ones that reduce σ1 the most and
are therefore the most effective when applying isolation. It is also not effective to
isolate neighboring nodes.
The results shown in tables 1 and 3 can be explained in part from the properties of
the matrix M and the graph Laplacian ∆. The maximal eigenvalue σ1 of M verifies
[7]
σ1 = sup X T M X.
(17)
kXk=1

9

We can find inequalities for σ1 by choosing
X = (1, 0 . . . 0)T , X = (0, 1, 0 . . . 0)T , . . .
Denoting di the degree of node i, we get
σ1 ≥ −ǫd1 + βS1 − γ,

(18)

σ1 ≥ −ǫd2 + βS2 − γ,
...

(19)
(20)

σ1 ≥ −ǫdn + βSn − γ,

(21)

σ1 ≥ −mink dk + βS − γ.

(22)

so that
This relation shows that isolating a node that has not smallest degree does not change
the estimate. Conversely, if there is a unique node of minimal degree and we isolate
it, then the bound changes.
Using similar arguments, it can be shown that isolating two neighboring nodes, say 1
and 2 will be less effective than isolating two non neighboring nodes.
Now we look at what happens if we cut a link, which corresponds to condemning
a road for example. Let ∆′ be the Laplacian of the new graph obtained by deleting a
link. Without loss of generality we can assume this link to be between vertices 1 and
2. Then ∆′ = ∆ − M where


−1 1
0 ... 0
M =  1 −1 0 . . . 0
0 ... ...
0
M has all eigenvalues equal to 0 except one which has value −2. Applying the
Courant-Weyl inequalities, see for example [7], we get the following result for the
maximum eigenvalue of ∆′
σ1′ ≤ σ1 .
Note that equality is possible: when S is homogeneous, the maximum eigenvalue of
M will always be −γ + βS. In such a case, cutting a link is ineffective.

3.3

Small diffusion and isolation policies

When diffusion is small, the nodes evolve almost independently so that the simple
dynamics of the scalar SIR model apply. Then some nodes can be isolated and the
epidemic is not seen there. Fig. 4 shows such a situation. We choose
β = 1.98, γ = 0.5, ǫ = 10−3
and the initial conditions are given in the table 3 below. The local R0 is also computed
and one sees that an outbreak will occur at nodes 1,3 and 5 and not at nodes 2,4 and
6. Fig. 4 shows the peaks for I3 and I5 and the maxima of I3 and I5 are close to the
ones predicted by the SIR formulas (4).

Propagation of COVID-19

We now consider the propagation of the Corona virus COVID-19 on a network consisting of a complete graph of 7 nodes with an additional link to an 8th node, see top
left panel of Fig. 5. The 7 nodes correspond to the following cities or regions, Hubei,
Beijing, Shanghai, Japan, western Europe, eastern USA and western USA and the
8th node is Mexico. The links are the main airline routes. We assume a complete
graph because airline routes connect any two of these regions.

Figure 5: Propagation of the COVID-19: the network composed of seven main
regions/cities in the world forming a complete graph is shown in the top left panel
and the time evolution of the infected per node is shown in the top right panel. In the
bottom panels, node 1 (Hubei) is only connected to node 2 (Beijing) and isolated from
the other nodes: see graph in the bottom left panel. The corresponding time evolution
of the infected is shown in the bottom right panel. The parameters are β = 0.5, γ = 0.2
and ǫ = 10−6 days−2 . At time t = 0 we assume I1 = 0.1, Ik = 0, k 6= 1.
The parameters chosen are β = 0.5, γ = 0.2 and ǫ = 10−6 days−2 . These were
suggested by very early estimations of the outbreak in Wuhan. Using the data from
the John Hopkins website [10] and our model, we estimated the starting time of
the outbreak in Mexico to be from March 20 to March 30 2020 [3]. These results
were shared with the Ministry of health of Mexico at the end of February 2020 so
that preparations could be made. In the present article, we analyze the model; we
therefore comment briefly the evolutions obtained in [3] as an interesting case.
The top right panel of Fig. 5 shows the time evolution in days of the infected
in the different nodes. The simulation is started at node 1 (Hubei in red in Fig.
5) with I1 = 0.1 and the other nodes are set at 0. The susceptibles are set to
1 everywhere. As expected the maximum I1∗ = 0.32 and the subsequent maxima
Ij∗ = 0.21, j = 2, . . . 8. Notice how the nodes 2-7 start simultaneously while node
8 is delayed. Communications with the province of Hubei were restricted at the end
of December 2019. To model this, we now consider that node 1 is only connected to
node 2 which forms a complete graph with nodes 3-7, see bottom left panel of Fig.
5. The infected are shown in the bottom right panel; as expected the epidemic first
arrives in node 2 then synchronously in nodes 3-7 and then in node 8.

12

To test the effect of having different β s at each node we increased β3 , reduced
β4 and kept the other β s the same. Then the epidemic arrives sooner at node 3 and
later at node 4. As expected from the formulas (4) I3∗ > Ij∗ > I4∗ for j = 5, 6, 7, see
[3].

Confinement and deconfinement

Since there is no vaccine for COVID-19 disease and the mortality is relatively high,
many countries put in place a confinement or measures to reduce the movement of
the population.

China confined the Hubei region around January 22, Italy confined its population
on March 9, France on March 17 and so on. In the middle of the epidemic, Spain
and France reached a situation like the one shown in Fig. 6. This picture shows
the number of patients in hospitals on April 5 2020 for the 12 different regions of
mainland France (see Table 4), the data was obtained from the website [12]. Note
how some regions are highly infected while others have many fewer cases. To use this
regional data of France, one could establish a graph of the main roads and railways
connecting the main cities, very much like the one for Mexico in Fig. 1.
Let us now consider the confinement. It can be implemented by
(i) reducing the contact ratio βj of each node j
(ii) reducing the diffusion ǫ, ie the travel between nodes
When deconfining the population once the peak of the epidemic has passed the two
options (i) and (ii) need to be relaxed, so as to avoid a so-called second wave. This
happens in particular when the epidemic affected a small fraction of the total number
N . Then, relaxing β or equivalently increasing N causes a number of new susceptibles
to enter the reaction and therefore produce a second peak of infection. The model (5)
allows to analyze the effect of the two options. We do this separately but note that
in reality both act together and effects can cancel.
Consider option (i). For this, we study the situation at a single node. We choose
the parameters
β = 0.33, γ = 0.13,
and the computation is started at t = 0 with S0 = 1, I0 = 0.01. Here, as before,
the units of I are percentages. In Fig. 7, we show the evolution of the infected for
a sudden increase of β from 0.33 to 0.5 at t = 20 before the peak (left panel, line b
) and t = 30 after the peak (right panel, line b). Clearly, the deconfinement before
the peak causes many more infections and could saturate the hospitals. Deconfining
after the peak as shown on the right panel of Fig. 7 is harmless. Only one node is
involved.

increase of β from 0.33 (curve a) to 0.5 (curve b) at t = 20 before the peak (left panel) and
t = 30 after the peak (right panel); γ = 0.13.

Another way of deconfining is to relax option (ii), that is allowing travel from
one node to another. This corresponds to increasing the diffusion which can bring
infected from large centers to small centers. To illustrate this, consider the graph
of two nodes shown in Fig. 8. It corresponds for the example of France Fig. 6, to
allowing travel between the large urban area of Paris and the much less populated
Normandy. The capacity of node 1 (Paris) is N1 = 20 106 while N2 = 106 . Now,
I1 and I2 are actual numbers and not percentages. We consider equations (5) where
Sj , Ij have been normalized by 106 . The parameters are

ǫ = 10−2 .

Figure 9: Deconfinement (ii). Time evolution I1 (t), I2 (t) for the two node graph shown in
Fig. 8 when ǫ is increased from 10−6 (curve a) to 10−2 (curve b), at t = 15 before the
epidemic peak (left panel) and at t = 22 (right panel) after the epidemic peak. The units are
in millions. See text for parameters and initial conditions.

Fig. 9 shows I1 (t) (top panels) and I2 (t) (bottom panels) when deconfining before
the peak (left panels) and after the peak (right panels). The curves I1 (t), I2 (t) before
and after deconfining are indicated by a and b respectively. The y scale are in millions.
Deconfining before the peak is not so harmful for node 1 while it is catastrophic for
node 2, I2 is multiplied by 3. After the peak, a sudden deconfinement prolongs the
epidemic at node 2.

Discusion and conclusion

For the COVID-19 epidemic, few articles have addressed the coupling of an epidemic
model to the geographical landscape. The subject is difficult as mobility is not well
understood at microscopic level. It is also difficult to extract a model from the available data.
In the reference [13], the authors estimated how mobility and transmissibility affect
the onset of the epidemic in the cities adjacent to Wuhan in the territory of China.
They found that reducing the mobility between cities by some factor did not change
the time of onset of the epidemic peaks. This is unexpected as seen in the present
article where reducing the mobility by orders of magnitude delays the onset of the
epidemic. Also the world data [10] and [11] shows clearly the epidemic peaking first
16

in China, then in Iran, Italy and so on. Therefore, the result of [13] might be due to
the fact that small changes are effected on the mobility. It might also be due to the
model of mobility chosen.
For Brazil, the study [14] considers a six equation compartimental model coupled
to a complex mobility scheme. The authors show that the epidemic curves vary
”enormously” over different geographic scales. Outbreaks can start in big cities and
propagate to the countryside or there might be multiple foci of infection. It is difficult
to get a view of the epidemic at the scale of the network with such a complex model.
In our study, we used the simplest susceptible-infected equations at the nodes
coupled by a geographic diffusion term. This contains the essential ingredient of
importation of infected subjects from country to country. We have kept the number
of parameters to a minimum so that fitting the data can be successful. This is
particularly important for the present epidemic of COVID-19 where one wants to get
a global picture at the level of the network.
The Laplacian models well the symmetric flow from one node to another. This is
a first order approximation of the spreading of infected in terms of diffusion. One can
refine the approximation using a kernel of an anomalous or stochastic diffusion but
then more careful measures of the ways the infection travels are needed.
On the analysis side, using this model, we generalized the well-known epidemic
criterion of Kermack-McKendrick. For small diffusion, outbreaks occur at different
times as the disease advances through the network. A larger diffusion will cause the
outbreak to occur synchronously on the network. Using this criterion, we designed
an isolation policy: we find it best to isolate high degree nodes and not efficient to
isolate neighbors.
We also discussed the important aspect of deconfining a region after the outbreak.
Circulation between highly infected regions and less impacted areas should be reduced
to prevent the spread of infected to the latter. Large clusters should be carefully
controlled.
Finally the study points out the usefulness of having accurate data at country and
local levels (cities, neighborhoods and hospitals).

Well-posedness of the model

To prove the well-posedness, we rewrite the system (7) as the following abstract
differential equation:
 ′
x (t) = Ax(t) + f (x(t))
(28)
x(0) = x0 ∈ Rn
 
s
where x :=
, A is the matrix given by
i


∆ 0
A :=
0 ∆
and f : Rn × Rn −→ R2n defined by
f (x) :=



−βsi
βsi − γi
19



and x0 :=



S0
I0


.

It is clear that, the function f is Lf -lipschitzian with Lf depends only on β and
γ. Now, we formulate the well-posedness theorem, which is the main theorem of this
section:
Theorem B.1 Given x0 ∈ Rn . Then, the equation (28) has a unique solution satisfying the following formula:
Z t
tA
x(t) = e x0 +
e(t−s)A f (x(s))ds, t ≥ 0.
(29)
0

proof
Let x0 ∈ Rn and T > 0. Consider the mapping Γ : C −→ C given by
Z t
Γu(t) = etA x0 +
e(t−s)A f (u(s))ds
0

where C := C([0, T ], Rn ). Let us prove that Γ is a contraction. Indeed, let u, v ∈ C,
then
Z t
kΓ(u(t)) − Γ(v(t))k ≤
e(t−s)kAk kf (u(s)) − f (v(s))kds
0
Z t
≤ Lf
e(t−s)kAk ku(s) − v(s)kds
0
Z t
T kAk
≤ Lf e
ku(s) − v(s)kds
0

≤ Lf eT kAk tku − vk∞ .
On the other hand
kΓ2 (u(t)) − Γ2 (v(t))k

=
≤

kΓ(Γu(t)) − Γ(Γv(t))k
Z t
Lf eT kAk
skΓ(u(s)) − Γ(v(s))kds
0

(Lf eT kAk t)2
≤
ku − vk∞ .
2
Hence, by iterating for n ≥ 1, we conclude that
kΓn (u(t)) − Γn (v(t))k

≤

(Lf eT kAk T )n
ku − vk∞ .
n!

Now, for n large enough,
(Lf eT kAk T )n
< 1.
n!
The mapping Γn is a contraction. Therefore, by using the iterating fixed point theorem
Γ is also a contraction. Consequently, the system (13) has a unique solution which is
given by (14). end proof
