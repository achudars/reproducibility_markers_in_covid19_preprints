Abstract. While social living is considered to be an indispensable part of human life in today’s
ever-connected world, social distancing has recently received much public attention on its importance
since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. In fact, social distancing has long been practiced in
nature among solitary species, and been taken by human as an effective way of stopping or slowing
down the spread of infectious diseases. Here we consider a social distancing problem for how a
population, when in a world with a network of social sites, decides to visit or stay at some sites
while avoiding or closing down some others so that the social contacts across the network can be
minimized. We model this problem as a network population game, where every individual tries to
find some network sites to visit or stay so that he/she can minimize all his/her social contacts. In
the end, an optimal strategy can be found for every one, when the game reaches an equilibrium.
We show that a large class of equilibrium strategies can be obtained by selecting a set of social
sites that forms a so-called maximal r-regular subnetwork. The latter includes many well studied
network types, which are easy to identify or construct, and can be completely disconnected (with
r = 0) for the most strict isolation, or allow certain degree of connectivities (with r > 0) for more
flexible distancing. We derive the equilibrium conditions of these strategies, and analyze their rigidity
and flexibility on different types of r-regular subnetworks. We also extend our model to weighted
networks, when different contact values are assigned to different network sites.

1. Introduction. Humans participate in all sorts of social activities, especially
in modern societies. We go to school, go to work, attend meetings, go shopping,
go to restaurants, watch shows, movies, or sports, etc. The world is formed by a
huge number of social sites that host these activities. These sites are also closely
connected for people to contact, meet, and socialize across. The world is a wellconnected network. People’s daily life is simply a busy agenda of events at different
event sites in this network, with different visiting frequencies for different sites. As
such, the world can be modeled as a social network, with the nodes representing the
social sites and the links the connections among the social sites. The social life of an
individual can be described by the frequencies of the individual to visit these social
sites, and the social behavior of the population can be described by these frequencies
averaged over the whole population.
Mathematically, we can represent a social network with a graph G = (V, E), where
V = {1, . . . , n} is a set of nodes corresponding to the social sites of the network, and
E = {(i, j) : i and j connected} a set of links between the nodes representing the
social connections among the social sites. Let x ∈ Rn , x ≥ 0, Σi xi = 1, be a vector
describing the social behavior of an individual on G, with xi being the frequency of the
individual to visit or stay at node i of G. Then, we can define a vector y ∈ Rn , y ≥ 0,
Σi yi = 1, for the social behavior of the whole population, with yi being the average
frequency of the population to visit or stay at node i of G. Let A be the adjacency

matrix of G, Ai,j = 1 if (i, j) ∈ E, Ai,j = 0 if (i, j) 6∈ E, and Ai,i = α ∈ [0, 1] for all
i = 1, . . . , n. Then, in a y-population, the amount of social contacts an x-individual
can make at node i must be xi Ai,i yi , the contacts with the population on node i,
plus xi Ai,j yj , the contacts with the population on other nodes j, all together equal
to Σj xi Ai,j yj . Across the network, the social contacts this individual can make must
be Σi Σj xi Ai,j yj = xT Ay.
Consider x as the social strategy of an individual, and y the social strategy of
the population. Consider π(x, y) = xT Ay as a payoff function. We can then define a
network population game where each individual of the population tries to maximize
his/her social payoff. The latter can be achieved when an optimal strategy x∗ is found
for every individual. The strategy for the population then becomes x∗ as well, and a
Nash equilibrium is reached. A Nash equilibrium of this game is thus a strategy x∗
such that
π(x∗ , x∗ ) ≥ π(x, x∗ ), ∀x ∈ S
where S = {x ∈ Rn : Σi xi = 1, xi ≥ 0, i = 1, . . . , n} is the set of all possible social
strategies. We call this game a social networking game on network G. For social
networking, we encourage interactions across different social sites and do not count
the contacts among individuals in the same sites, and therefore, set Ai,i = 0 for all
i = 1, . . . , n.
Different from social networking, social distancing is to reduce social contacts
instead. Therefore, for a given social network, social distancing can be considered
as a problem to find a set of social sites in the network where interactions within
and between these sites can be minimized. It can therefore be modeled as a network population game where each individual tries to minimize his/her social contacts
π(x, y) = xT Ay. A Nash equilibrium of this game is then a strategy x∗ such that
π(x∗ , x∗ ) ≤ π(x, x∗ ), ∀x ∈ S.
We call this game a social distancing game on network G. For social distancing,
we also count the contacts among individuals in the same sites, and therefore, set
Ai,i = 1 for all i = 1, . . . , n. Let Ḡ = (V̄ , Ē) be the complement of G, with V̄ = V
and Ē = {(i, j) : (i, j) 6∈ E}. Then, it is easy to see that a social distancing game
on network G is equivalent to a social networking game on Ḡ, and vice versa (See
Figure 1).
While social living is considered to be an indispensable part of human life in
today’s ever-connected world, social distancing has recently received much public
attention on its importance since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic [1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6]. In fact, social distancing has long been practiced in nature among solitary
animals, who always try to distance themselves from others, sometimes for more
efficient foraging, sometimes for self-protection from infightings, and sometimes for
avoiding disease infections as well [7, 8, 9]. In human societies, social distancing has
been recommended by health experts as a special yet effective measure for mitigating
the spread of diseases during epidemic or pandemic [10, 11, 12, 13]. It can be as
simple as just to keep distances from each other, or be more cooperative to follow
certain rules such as avoiding large gatherings, canceling events, and closing schools,
or to shut down places such as movie theaters, shopping centers, and commercial areas
[14, 15].
Much work has been done on modeling social distancing in the past [16, 17,
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] and especially in this year since the outbreak of the

coronavirus pandemic [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32], most focusing on epidemiological models
and predictions, with social distancing as a behavioral factor affecting the spread of
the diseases. The impacts of distancing behaviors on contact rates, transmission rates,
and hence the infectious rates have been investigated through statistical estimation,
dynamic simulation, and model prediction. Our work is focused more on planning of
social distancing for a population on how to separate, what to avoid, and where to stay
to minimize social contacts and mitigate the spread of the diseases. More specifically,
we consider a social distancing problem for how the individuals of a given population,
when in a world with a network of social sites, find some sites of the network to visit or
stay while avoiding or closing down some others so that the social contacts among the
individuals across the network can be minimized. This can be critical as a personal
decision to make, and perhaps more so as a public health policy to implement. This
problem can be modeled as a social distancing game as described above, where every
individual tries to find some network sites to visit or stay so that he/she can minimize
all his/her social contacts. In the end, an optimal strategy can be found for everyone,
when the game reaches an equilibrium. We show that a large class of equilibrium
strategies can be obtained by selecting a set of network sites that forms a so-called
maximal r-regular subnetwork. A regular subnetwork is a subnetwork of all nodes
of equal degree. An r-regular subnetwork is a subnetwork of all nodes of degree r
[33, 34] (see Figure 2). The latter includes many well studied network types, such
as the maximal independent set (r = 0), the maximal strong matching (r = 1), the
maximal set of independent cycles (r = 2), etc. They are easy to identify or construct,
and can be completely disconnected (with r = 0) for the most strict isolation, or allow
certain degree of connectivities (with r > 0) for more flexible distancing. We derive
the equilibrium conditions of these strategies, and analyze their rigidity and flexibility
on different types of r-regular subnetworks. We also extend our model to weighted
networks, when different contact values are assigned to different network sites.
Our work do share some important features with other previous studies. For
example, Reluga and co-workers [23, 35, 36, 26] have also applied a game dynamic
approach to the study of social distancing. Their game involves the investment on
social distancing and its effect on the dynamics of SIR populations. Our game is
instead for choosing locations for social distancing in a given network of social sites.
Eubank et al. [16, 37, 38, 39, 40] have started investigating network based models
in early 2000, and analyzed and simulated large social networks and their impacts
3

on epidemics. Meyers et al. [41, 19, 42, 43, 44] have led multiple efforts on contact
network based epidemic modeling, mostly concerning networks of person-to-person
contacts. The networks studied in our work can be considered as a special type of
contact networks, where the nodes are locations, and the contacts are made through
access to the connected locations.

2. Optimal Distancing Strategies. In the social distancing game on a network, every individual wants to find a network site to distance himself/herself from
others. In an attempt, a site with a small number of connections would be a good
choice. However, if everyone chooses this site, no one will benefit. Therefore, a strategy is needed to select a set of sites to visit or stay with only certain frequency at each.
Let x∗ ∈ S be a strategy everyone would like to take, with x∗j being the frequency of
visiting or staying at site j. In effect, the population will distribute on the network
also as x∗ , with x∗j being the probable fraction on site j. With the population distributed as such, the social contacts an individual at site i can make with the population
at site j will be Ai,j x∗j . If there is a link between i and j, i.e., Ai,j = 1, Ai,j x∗j = x∗j ;
otherwise, Ai,j x∗j = 0. In total, the social contacts this individual can make, if at site
i, will be pi (x∗ ) = Σj Ai,j x∗j . The competition among all the sites is then balanced if
pi (x∗ ) are the same, say equal to λ∗ , for all i such that x∗i > 0, i.e., for all the sites
selected to visit or stay. In addition, λ∗ must be smaller than or equal to pi (x∗ ) for all
i such that x∗i = 0, i.e., for all the sites not selected, for otherwise, by selecting such a
site i such that pi (x∗ ) < λ∗ , the individual will be able to reduce the social contacts
further. When all these conditions are satisfied, every individual with a strategy x∗
minimizes all his/her social contacts to Σi x∗i pi (x∗ ) = λ∗ , no more, no less, and an
equilibrium is reached.
Based on evolutionary game theory [45, 46], we can prove that the above condi4

tions are in fact necessary and sufficient for a strategy x∗ to be a Nash equilibrium
of the social distancing game on a network. We state this property in the following
theorem.
Theorem 2.1. Let A be the adjacency matrix of network G. Then, a strategy
x∗ ∈ S is a Nash equilibrium of the social distancing game on G if and only if there
is a scalar λ∗ such that pi (x∗ ) = λ∗ for all i such that x∗i > 0 and pi (x∗ ) ≥ λ∗ for all
i such that x∗i = 0, where pi (x∗ ) = Σj Ai,j x∗j .
Proof. (⇐): Assume that there is a scalar λ∗ such that pi (x∗ ) = λ∗ for all i
such that x∗i > 0 and pi (x∗i ) ≥ λ∗ for all i such that x∗i = 0. Then, π(x∗ , x∗ ) =
Σi x∗i pi (x∗ ) = λ∗ . Let x ∈ S be any strategy. Since pi (x∗ ) ≥ λ∗ for all i, π(x, x∗ ) =
Σi xi pi (x∗ ) ≥ λ∗ . Therefore, x∗ is a Nash equilibrium.
(⇒): Assume that x∗ is a Nash equilibrium. Then, π(x, x∗ ) ≥ π(x∗ , x∗ ) for all
x ∈ S. Let λ∗ = π(x∗ , x∗ ). Then, π(ei , x∗ ) ≥ λ∗ for all i, i.e., pi (x∗ ) ≥ λ∗ for all i.
It follows that pi (x∗ ) ≥ λ∗ for all i such that x∗i = 0. If pi (x∗ ) > λ∗ for some i such
that x∗i > 0, then π(x∗ , x∗ ) = Σi x∗i pi (x∗ ) > λ∗ . Therefore, pi (x∗ ) = λ∗ for all i such
that x∗i > 0.
Let V ∗ be the set of nodes in G selected by a strategy x∗ , i.e., V ∗ = {i ∈ V :
x∗i > 0}. Let E ∗ be the set of links between the nodes in V ∗ , i.e., E ∗ = {(i, j) ∈
E : i, j ∈ V ∗ }. We call G∗ = (V ∗ , E ∗ ) the subnetwork of G supporting x∗ . For an
individual, an equilibrium strategy x∗ on G∗ then means to visit or stay only at the
nodes of G∗ , with a nonzero frequency x∗i at node i of G∗ , while for the population,
it implies to spread only on the nodes of G∗ , with a nonzero probable fraction x∗i on
node i of G∗ . In either view, strategy x∗ with a choice of nodes in G∗ maximizes the
social distances and minimizes the social contacts among all the individuals of the
population, if a link between two nodes is counted as a contact while no link as a
distance.
The equilibrium strategy for the social distancing game on a network is not necessarily unique. Different equilibrium strategies may have different minimal social
contacts. In general, the fewer connections in supporting subnetwork G∗ , the smaller
amount of social contacts at equilibrium. Therefore, an equilibrium strategy without
connections in G∗ can be a first choice for distancing. Such a G∗ is called an independent set of G. It is easy to verify that the larger the independent set, the better the
corresponding strategy, when a larger amount of social contacts is minimized. The
largest possible independent set that is not contained in another independent set is
called a maximal independent set. In fact, a distancing strategy on an independent
set of G is not necessarily a Nash equilibrium, but it always is if it is on a maximal
independent set of G.
Theorem 2.2. Let x∗ ∈ S be a strategy for the social distancing game on a
network G = (V, E). Let G∗ = (V ∗ , E ∗ ) be the supporting subnetwork for x∗ . Then,
if G∗ is a maximal independent set of G, x∗ is a Nash equilibrium for the game, with
x∗i = 1/k for all i ∈ V ∗ and x∗i = 0 for all i ∈ V \V ∗ , where k is the size of V ∗ .
Proof. Assume without loss of generality that G∗ = (V ∗ , E ∗ ) with V ∗ = {1, . . . , k}.
Then, Ai,j = 0 for all i, j = 1, . . . , k, i 6= j and Ai,i = 1 for all i = 1, . . . , k.
Since G∗ supports x∗ , x∗i > 0 for all i ∈ V ∗ and x∗i = 0 for all i ∈ V \V ∗ . Let
pi (x∗ ) = Σj Ai,j x∗j = λ∗ for all i ∈ V ∗ . Then, x∗i = λ∗ for all i ∈ V ∗ . Since Σi x∗i = 1,
1 = kλ∗ and x∗i = λ∗ = 1/k for all i ∈ V ∗ . Since G∗ is a maximal independent
set, for any i ∈ V \V ∗ , there must be l ∈ V ∗ such that i and l are connected, i.e.,
(i, l) ∈ E and Ai,l = 1. Therefore, for any i ∈ V \V ∗ , pi (x∗ ) = Σj Ai,j x∗j ≥ x∗l = λ∗ .
5

By Theorem 2.1, x∗ is a Nash equilibrium.
Note that if G∗ is an independent set of G but not a maximal one, there will
be i ∈ V \V ∗ not connected with any j ∈ V ∗ and pi (x∗ ) = Σj Ai,j x∗j = 0 < λ∗ .
Then, x∗ cannot be a Nash equilibrium. Theorem 2.2 suggests that if there is a
maximal independent set of nodes in the network, an optimal distancing strategy for
an individual will be to choose only this set of nodes to visit or stay with an equal
frequency 1/k for each node, where k is the size of the set. As a result, the population
will then be distributed only on this set of nodes with an equally probable fraction
1/k on each node. At equilibrium, every individual minimizes his/her total amount of
social contacts to λ∗ = 1/k. Therefore, the larger the maximal independent set, the
better for minimizing the social contacts, and the strategy on a maximum independent
set will be the best among all those supported by a maximal independent set.
Figure 3 shows an example network, representing a world of 10 connected social
sites. The inside 5 sites, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, may be town centers, well connected. The
outside 5 sites, {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, may be residential areas, each having access to some of
the town centers. In this network, the sites {3, 5, 9} form a maximal independent set.
An equilibrium strategy x∗ can be reached on this set of sites, with x∗3 = x∗5 = x∗9 = 1/3
and all other elements x∗j = 0, and a minimal social contact λ∗ = 1/3. However, the
sites {6, 7, 8, 9, 10} form another maximal independent set. An equilibrium strategy
x∗ can be reached on this set of sites, with x∗6 = x∗7 = x∗8 = x∗9 = x∗10 = 1/5 and all
other elements x∗j = 0, and a minimal social contact λ∗ = 1/5. The latter is an even
better strategy than the former.

Fig. 3. Social Distancing on Independent Sets. In the network shown in this figure, the network
sites {3, 5, 9} form a maximal independent set. An equilibrium strategy x∗ can be reached on this
set of sites, with x∗3 = x∗5 = x∗9 = 1/3 and all other elements x∗j = 0, and a minimal social contact
λ∗ = 1/3. However, the sites {6, 7, 8, 9, 10} form another maximal independent set. An equilibrium
strategy x∗ can be reached on this set of sites, with x∗6 = x∗7 = x∗8 = x∗9 = x∗10 = 1/5 and all other
elements x∗j = 0, and a minimal social contact λ∗ = 1/5. The latter is an even better strategy than
the former.

An equilibrium strategy may as well be supported by a subnetwork where there
are some connections among the nodes. A general class of subnetworks that may be
selected by an equilibrium strategy is the regular networks. In a regular network, all
nodes have the same number of connections with other nodes. In other words, all
the nodes of a regular network have the same degree. If the degree is r, the network
is called an r-regular network. Thus, a maximal independent set of a given network
6

is a 0-regular network. A 1-regular network is where each node is connected only to
another one; a 2-regular network is where each node is connected to two other nodes;
and so on and so forth (see Figure 2).
A regular network can be connected or disconnected. In the latter case, it consists
of a number of disconnected components, each being a regular network itself. For an
r-regular subnetwork of G, the larger the subnetwork, the sparser the connectivity,
and the better for social distancing. The largest possible r-regular subnetwork that is
not a disconnected part of another r-regular subnetwork is called a maximal r-regular
subnetwork. A distancing strategy on an r-regular subnetwork may not necessarily
be an equilibrium strategy, but it always is if it is on a maximal r-regular subnetwork
and if there is no less than r + 1 connections to the subnetwork from an outside node.
Theorem 2.3. Let x∗ ∈ S be a strategy for the social distancing game on a
network G = (V, E). Let G∗ = (V ∗ , E ∗ ) be the supporting subnetwork for x∗ . Then,
if G∗ is a maximal r-regular subnetwork and if there is no less than r + 1 links to G∗
from a node i ∈ V \V ∗ , x∗ is a Nash equilibrium for the game, with x∗i = 1/k for all
i ∈ V ∗ and x∗i = 0 for all i ∈ V \V ∗ , where k is the size of V ∗ .
Proof. Assume without loss of generality that V ∗ = {1, . . . , k}. Then, A∗ =
{Ai,j , i, j = 1, . . . , k} is the adjacency matrix of G∗ , and each of its rows and columns
has exactly r + 1 elements equal to 1. Since G∗ supports x∗ , x∗i > 0 for all i ∈ V ∗
and x∗i = 0 for all i ∈ V \V ∗ . It follows that pi (x∗ ) = Σj Ai,j x∗j = Σj∈V ∗ Ai,j x∗j for
all i ∈ V ∗ . Let Σj∈V ∗ Ai,j x∗j = λ∗ for all i ∈ V ∗ . By adding all these equations,
we obtain r + 1 = kλ∗ , and λ∗ = (r + 1)/k. By solving the equations for x∗i , for all
i ∈ V ∗ , we also have x∗i = 1/k for all i ∈ V ∗ . Since there is no less than r + 1 links
to G∗ from a node i ∈ V \V ∗ , pi (x∗ ) = Σj Ai,j x∗j = Σj∈V ∗ Ai,j x∗j ≥ (r + 1)/k = λ∗ for
any i ∈ V \V ∗ . By Theorem 2.1, x∗ is a Nash equilibrium.
Theorem 2.3 suggests that if there is a maximal r-regular subnetwork in the network, an optimal distancing strategy for an individual will be to choose only this
subnetwork to visit or stay with an equal frequency 1/k for each node of the subnetwork, where k is the number of the nodes in the subnetwork. As a result, the
population will then be distributed only on this subnetwork with an equally probable
fraction 1/k on each node of the subnetwork. At equilibrium, every individual minimizes his/her total amount of social contacts to λ∗ = (r + 1)/k. Therefore, the larger
the regular subnetwork or the smaller the r value, the better for minimizing the social
contacts.
Of particular interest among maximal regular subnetworks are those with a large
number of disconnected components. For example, a maximal 1-regular subnetwork
is just a set of disconnected 1-regular subnetworks of size 2; a maximal 2-regular
subnetwork can be a large number of disconnected 2-regular subnetworks of size 3;
etc. An equilibrium strategy on such a subnetwork means that the population can
spread on a large number of independent locations, where at each location, there is a
group of social sites with a low degree of connectivity. Such a strategy allows certain
degree of local contacts yet keeps maximal possible distances among individuals, and
can therefore be considered as a more flexible strategy for social distancing than those
on maximal independent sets.
Figure 4 shows a network similar to the one in Figure 3 except for some changes in
contact connections. In this network, the sites {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} form a 2-regular subnetwork. However, a strategy on this subnetwork cannot be an equilibrium strategy because there are nodes outside the subnetwork, say node 6, with less than 3 connections
to the nodes in the subnetwork. For the same reason, a strategy on the 2-regular sub7

network formed by the sites {6, 7, 8, 9, 10} cannot be an equilibrium strategy, either.
On the other hand, the whole network itself is a 3-regular network. An equilibrium
strategy x∗ can be reached on the whole network with x∗i = 1/10 for all i = 1, . . . , 10,
and a minimal social contact λ∗ = 2/5.
In the network in Figure 4, there are also equilibrium strategies supported by
other regular subnetworks. For example, the sites {1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10} form a 1-regular
subnetwork of size 6. An equilibrium strategy x∗ can be reached on this subnetwork
with x∗1 = x∗2 = x∗4 = x∗8 = x∗9 = x∗10 = 1/6 and all other elements x∗j = 0, and a
minimal social contact λ∗ = 1/3. There are total 5 such equilibrium strategies on this
network. Furthermore, the sites {3, 5, 6, 7} form a maximal independent set of sites
or in other words, a 0-regular subnetwork. An equilibrium strategy x∗ can be reached
on this set of sites with x∗3 = x∗5 = x∗6 = x∗7 = 1/4 and all other elements x∗j = 0, and
a minimal social contact λ∗ = 1/4. There are total 4 such equilibrium strategies on
this network. In terms of minimal social contact, among these strategies, the one on
the maximal independent set, i.e., on a 0-regular subnetwork, is the best, because its
social contact is the lowest. However, it is also the most strict strategy, for it does not
allow any contacts across different sites. The strategy on the whole network, i.e., on a
3-regular network, has the highest social contact, but it is the most flexible strategy,
allowing certain degree of contacts across different sites.

Fig. 4. Social Distancing on Regular Subnetworks. In the network shown in this figure, the
network sites {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} form a 2-regular subnetwork. However, a strategy on this subnetwork
cannot be an equilibrium strategy because there are nodes outside of the subnetwork, say node 6,
with less than 3 connections to the nodes in the subnetwork. For the same reason, a strategy on the
2-regular subnetwork formed by the sites {6, 7, 8, 9, 10} cannot be an equilibrium strategy either. On
the other hand, the network itself is a 3-regular network. An equilibrium strategy x∗ can be reached
on the whole network with x∗i = 1/10 for i = 1, . . . , 10 and a minimal social contact λ∗ = 2/5.

3. Rigidity and Flexibility of Social Distancing. Once an equilibrium is
reached, i.e., a distancing rule is established, can we make some small changes or
adjustments on the strategy? This is a question of legitimate concern in practice, for
we may not be able to commit to a rule all the time. The answer to the question is
that it depends on whether the social contact is changed: if the contact is increased
with small changes in the strategy, the rule needs to be enforced, and we say the
strategy is rigid; if the contact is not changed, the rule is not strict, and we say the
strategy is flexible; if the contact is decreased, the rule is broken, and we say the
strategy is fragile. In order to further address this issue, we give a formal definition
8

for rigidity, flexibility, and fragility for a distancing strategy in the following. We then
analyze the strategies on maximal r-regular subnetworks with these properties.
Let x∗ ∈ S be an equilibrium strategy for the social distancing game on network G. Let G∗ be the subnetwork supporting x∗ . Let S ∗ = {x ∈ S : xi >
0 for all i such that x∗i > 0}. Then, S ∗ is the set of strategies all supported by G∗ .
We define rigidity, flexibility, and fragility of x∗ only for small changes of x∗ in S ∗ .
Let D∗ = {d ∈ Rn : d = x − x∗ , x ∈ S ∗ , x 6= x∗ }. Then, d ∈ D∗ is a direction such
that x∗ + d, a small change of x∗ along d, remains in S ∗ for all  > 0 sufficiently
small.
Defintion 3.1. Let x∗ ∈ S be an equilibrium strategy for the social distancing
game on network G supported by subnetwork G∗ . Then, x∗ is said to be strongly rigid
on G∗ if for any d ∈ D∗ , π(x∗ + d, x∗ + d) > π(x∗ , x∗ ) for all  > 0 sufficiently
small.
Defintion 3.2. Let x∗ ∈ S be an equilibrium strategy for the social distancing
game on network G supported by subnetwork G∗ . Then, x∗ is said to be weakly rigid
on G∗ if for any d ∈ D∗ , π(x∗ + d, x∗ + d) ≥ π(x∗ , x∗ ) for all  > 0 sufficiently
small.
Defintion 3.3. Let x∗ ∈ S be an equilibrium strategy for the social distancing
game on network G supported by subnetwork G∗ . Then, x∗ is said to be flexible on
G∗ if there is d ∈ D∗ such that π(x∗ + d, x∗ + d) = π(x∗ , x∗ ) for all  > 0 sufficiently
small.
Defintion 3.4. Let x∗ ∈ S be an equilibrium strategy for the social distancing
game on network G supported by subnetwork G∗ . Then, x∗ is said to be fragile on G∗
if there is d ∈ D∗ such that π(x∗ + d, x∗ + d) < π(x∗ , x∗ ) for all  > 0 sufficiently
small.
Recall that π(x, x) is the social contact of the population of strategy x. Therefore,
the definition of rigidity basically implies that an equilibrium strategy x∗ is strongly
(or weakly) rigid if it is a strict (or non-strict) local minimizer of the social contact
π(x, x) in S ∗ . In this sense, the strong (or weak) rigidity can be considered as a
weaker version of strong (or weak) evolutionary stability for general evolutionary
games [45, 46]. Nonetheless, we call this property rigidity instead of stability because
the corresponding strategy is considered as a rigid distancing rule in the context of
social distancing. Note that based on the above definitions, if an equilibrium strategy
is weakly rigid, it must be flexible; however, if it is flexible, it may not necessarily be
weakly rigid; It could be fragile.
We now investigate these properties for strategies on maximal r-regular subnetworks. First, it is easy to justify that the equilibrium strategies on a maximal independent set are all strongly rigid: Small changes on such strategies always increase
the social contacts. In other words, there will be penalties for any changes on such
strategies. On the other hand, the equilibrium strategies on any maximal r-regular
subnetworks with r > 0 are always flexible: In this case, we can find some connected
nodes in the subnetworks. By increasing the frequencies on some of these nodes while
decreasing on others, we can make some small changes on the strategy without changing the original amount of social contacts. Of these flexible strategies, some may be
weakly rigid, but others may be fragile.
Theorem 3.1. Let x∗ ∈ S be an equilibrium strategy for the social distancing
game on network G = (V, E). If x∗ is supported by a maximal independent set G∗ =
(V ∗ , E ∗ ), then x∗ is strongly rigid on G∗ .
9

Proof. Let x∗ + d be a change from x∗ for any d ∈ D∗ and  > 0 sufficiently
small. Then,
π(x∗ + d, x∗ + d) = (x∗ + d)T A(x∗ + d)
= x∗T Ax∗ + 2dT Ax∗ + 2 dT Ad.
Note that d = x − x∗ for some x ∈ S ∗ , x 6= x∗ . Therefore, d 6= 0, but di = 0 for
i ∈ V \V ∗ , and Σi∈V ∗ di = 0. Note also that (Ax∗ )i = λ∗ for all i ∈ V ∗ and therefore,
dT Ax∗ = Σi∈V ∗ di (Ax∗ )i = 0. In addition, since G∗ is a maximal independent set,
{Ai,j , i, j ∈ V ∗ }, the adjacency matrix of G∗ , is an identity matrix. Therefore,
dT Ad = Σi,j∈V ∗ di Ai,j dj = Σi∈V ∗ d2i > 0. It follows that
π(x∗ + d, x∗ + d) = x∗T Ax∗ + 2 dT Ad
> x∗T Ax∗ = π(x∗ , x∗ ).
By Definition 3.1, x∗ is strongly rigid on G∗ .
Theorem 3.2. Let x∗ ∈ S be an equilibrium strategy for the social distancing
game on network G = (V, E). If x∗ is supported by a maximal r-regular subnetwork
G∗ = (V ∗ , E ∗ ) with r > 0, then x∗ is flexible on G∗ .
Proof. Since G∗ is an r-regular subnetwork with r > 0, there must be i, j ∈ V ∗
such that (i, j) ∈ E ∗ and Ai,j = 1. Let d be a vector such that di = −dj = δ with
0 < δ < min{1 − x∗i , x∗j } and dl = 0 for all l 6= i, j. Then, d ∈ D∗ . Let x∗ + d be a
change from x∗ along d for  > 0 sufficiently small. Then,
π(x∗ + d, x∗ + d) = (x∗ + d)T A(x∗ + d)
= x∗T Ax∗ + 2dT Ax∗ + 2 dT Ad.
Since (Ax∗ )k = λ∗ for all k ∈ V ∗ , dT Ax∗ = (di + dj )λ∗ = 0. Also, dT Ad = Ai,i d2i +
2Ai,j di dj + Aj,j d2j = 0. It follows that
π(x∗ + d, x∗ + d) = (x∗ + d)T A(x∗ + d)
= x∗T Ax∗ = π(x∗ , x∗ ).
By Definition 3.3, x∗ is flexible on G∗ .
Based on Theorem 3.1 and 3.2, for the example distancing problem shown in
Figure 4, the equilibrium strategy on a maximal independent set such as {3, 5, 6, 7} is
strongly rigid, and the one on a maximal 1-regular subnetwork such as {1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10}
is flexible. The equilibrium strategy on the whole network, which is a 3-regular
network, is also flexible. Therefore, as described in the proof for Theorem 3.2, for
this strategy, the frequencies can be exchanged between any two connected nodes, say
node 1 and 2, by moving a small amount from one node to another. For example, by
moving 1/20 from node 1 to node 2, the frequency on node 1 decreases to 1/20 from
1/10 while on node 2 increases to 3/20 from 1/10, yet the minimal social contact for
every individual remains to be 2/5.
Note that an r-regular network must have at least r+1 nodes. We call an r-regular
network of size r + 1 a minimal r-regular network. A minimal r-regular network must
be a complete network, i.e., each node is connected with all others in the network. It
turns out that an equilibrium strategy for the social distancing game on a network
is always weakly rigid if it is supported by a maximal r-regular subnetwork whose
components are all minimal r-regular subnetworks with r > 0:
10

Theorem 3.3. Let x∗ ∈ S be an equilibrium strategy for the social distancing
game on network G = (V, E). Then, x∗ is weakly rigid if it is supported by a maximal r-regular subnetwork G∗ = (V ∗ , E ∗ ) whose components are all minimal r-regular
subnetworks with r > 0.
Proof. Let G∗i = (Vi∗ , Ei∗ ) be the ith r-regular subnetwork in G∗ and A(i) the
adjacency matrix of G∗i , i = 1, . . . , m. Then, A(i) is a matrix of all 1’s. Let x∗ + d
be a change from x∗ for any d ∈ D∗ and  > 0 sufficiently small.
π(x∗ + d, x∗ + d) = (x∗ + d)T A(x∗ + d)
= x∗T Ax∗ + 2dT Ax∗ + 2 dT Ad.
Note that d = x − x∗ for some x ∈ S ∗ , x 6= x∗ . Therefore, d 6= 0, but di = 0 for
i ∈ V \V ∗ , and Σi∈V ∗ di = 0. Note also that (Ax∗ )i = λ∗ for all i ∈ V ∗ and therefore,
dT Ax∗ = Σi∈V ∗ di (Ax∗ )i = 0. Let ci = {dj : j ∈ Vi∗ }. Then,
dT Ad = Σi=1:m cTi A(i) ci = Σi=1:m (Σj∈Vi∗ dj )2 ≥ 0.
It follows that
π(x∗ + d, x∗ + d) = (x∗ + d)T A(x∗ + d)
= x∗T Ax∗ + 2 dT Ad ≥ x∗T Ax∗ = π(x∗ , x∗ ).
By Definition 3.2, x∗ is weakly rigid on G∗ .
From the above proof, we see that if we update x∗ with a vector d such that
Σj∈Vi∗ dj = 0 for all i = 1, . . . , m, we will have dT Ad = 0, and hence (x∗ + d)T A(x∗ +
d) = x∗T Ax∗ , i.e., the minimal social contacts will remain to be the same. This means
that we can make such small changes in frequencies on the subnetwork components
independently without changing the original amount of social contacts across the
network. In fact, we can make such changes on any group of supporting components
as long as they are minimal regular subnetworks.
Figure 5 shows an example network with 16 social sites. It is structured like a
small town, with 4 connected town centers in the middle and 4 separated residential areas outside around. Every residential area consists of 3 well-connected activity
sites, each having access to one of the town centers. The social distancing game
on this network has at least three equilibrium strategies: one on the maximal 0regular subnetwork or in other words, the maximal independent set {5, 6, 7, 8} with
the minimal social contact equal to 1/4; one on the maximal 1-regular subnetwork
{9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16} with the minimal social contact equal to 1/4; and one on
the maximal 2-regular subnetwork {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16} with the minimal social contact equal to 1/4. The minimal social contacts of the three strategies
are all the same. However, based on Theorem 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 , the first one is
strictly rigid; the second and third are flexible and only weakly rigid. In addition, the
supporting subnetworks for the second and third strategies consist of disconnected
minimal regular subnetworks. The frequencies on those minimal subnetworks can be
adjusted independently without affecting the social contacts of the individuals. For
example, for the third strategy, for each minimal 2-regular subnetwork component,
say the subnetwork {5, 9, 10}, a small fraction 1/24 can be moved from each of the
outer most two sites, say the sites 9 and 10, to the inner site, say the site 5. The
fractions on the outer sites are then decreased from 1/12 to 1/24 while on the inner

Fig. 5. Rigidity and Flexibility of Distancing Strategies. The social distancing game on this
network has at least three equilibrium strategies: one on the maximal 0-regular subnetwork or in
other words, maximal independent set {5, 6, 7, 8} with the minimal social contact equal to 1/4; one
on the maximal 1-regular subnetwork {9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16} with the minimal social contact
equal to 1/4; and one on {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16} with the minimal social contact equal
to 1/4. The first one is strictly rigid. The second and third are flexible and weakly rigid.

site is increased from 1/12 to 4/24. However, such changes will not affect the original
minimized social contact of the population.
Finally, if a maximal r-regular subnetwork is connected but not minimal, or disconnected but at least one of the components is not minimal, then an equilibrium
strategy supported by such a subnetwork will not be weakly rigid though still flexible.
It will in fact be fragile, i.e., there will be a certain way to update the strategy on the
subnetwork to decrease the social contacts among the individuals. Such changes will
make the population to break away from the current equilibrium state. An example
fragile strategy is the one on the whole network for the game shown in Figure 4. The
whole network is a 3-regular network, but it is not minimal.
Theorem 3.4. Let x∗ ∈ S be an equilibrium strategy for the social distancing
game on a network G = (V, E) supported by a maximal r-regular subnetwork G∗ =
(V ∗ , E ∗ ), r > 0. If G∗ is connected but not minimal, or disconnected but at least one
of its components is not minimal, then x∗ is fragile on G∗ .
Proof. Without loss of generality, we consider only the case where G∗ is connected.
If G is not a minimal r-regular subnetwork, there must be three nodes i, j, l such that
(i, l), (j, l) ∈ E ∗ , but (i, j) 6∈ E ∗ . Let d be a vector such that dk = 0 for all k 6= i, j, l,
di = dj = δ, with 0 < δ < min{1 − x∗i , 1 − x∗j , x∗l /2}, and di + dj + dl = 0. Then,
d ∈ D∗ . Let x∗ + d be a change from x∗ along d ∈ D∗ for  > 0 sufficiently small.
Then,
∗

π(x∗ + d, x∗ + d) = (x∗ + d)T A(x∗ + d)
= x∗T Ax∗ + 2dT Ax∗ + 2 dT Ad.
Note that (Ax∗ )k = λ∗ for all k ∈ V ∗ , and therefore,
dT Ax∗ = λ∗ Σk∈V ∗ dk = di + dj + dl = 0.
12

Note also,
dT Ad = d2i + d2j + d2l + 2di dl + 2dj dl
= (di + dj + dl )2 − 2di dj = −2di dj < 0.
Therefore,
π(x∗ + d, x∗ + d) = (x∗ + d)T A(x∗ + d)
= x∗T Ax∗ + 2 dT Ad < x∗T Ax∗ = π(x∗ , x∗ ).
By Definition 3.4, x∗ is fragile on G∗ .
4. Extension to Weighted Networks. So far, in all our discussions, we have
assumed that the social sites are all the same for making social contacts. However, in
real situation, different sites may have different sizes, different population densities,
different activities, and hence different contact rates. Therefore, a more realistic model
for a given world of social sites would be a weighted network of social sites, with each
site assigned a contact value. The total amount of social contacts an individual
can make will then be those made within each site and through connected sites, all
weighted by the contact values of the sites. We show that for such a weighted network
of social sites, we can define a similar social distancing game as we have discussed
in previous sections, and have similar distancing strategies and related rigidity and
flexibility properties.
Let A be the adjacency matrix of a given network G. Suppose for each social site i,
we assign a contact value wi ≥ 1. Then, in a population of strategy y, the total amount
of social contacts an individual can make at social site i will be pi (y) = Σj Ãi,j yj , where
Ãi,j is a value dependent of wi and wj . We consider two methods to define Ãi,j : (a)
with an additive weight, Ãi,j = (wi Ai,j + Ai,j wj )/2, i.e., if Ai,j = 1, Ãi,j is the sum
of the weights of site i and j; and (b) with a multiplicative weight, Ãi,j = wi Ai,j wj ,
i.e., if Ai,j = 1, Ãi,j is the multiplication of the weights of site i and j. Then,
if an individual takes a strategy x to visit all the social sites, the total amount of
social contacts the individual can make will be Σi xi pi (y) = Σi Σj xi Ãi,j yj = xT Ãy,
where Ã = {Ãi,j }. Let w = (w1 , . . . , wn )T , and W = diag[w], i.e., a diagonal matrix
with w as its diagonal vector. Then, Ã is a matrix with the same nonzero entries
of A, but weighted by W , and with additive weights, Ã = (W A + AW )/2, and with
multiplicative weights, Ã = W AW .
By considering Ã as a weighted adjacency matrix of network G, and π(x, y) =
xT Ãy as a payoff function, we can then define a social distancing game, where each
individual tries to minimize his/her weighted social contacts π(x, y) = xT Ãy. A Nash
equilibrium of this game is then a strategy x∗ such that
π(x∗ , x∗ ) ≤ π(x, x∗ ), ∀x ∈ S.
We call this game a weighted social distancing game on network G. Recall for social
distancing, we count the contacts among individuals in the same sites, and therefore
Ai,i = 1 for all i = 1, . . . , n. It follows that Ãi,i are nonzero, and Ãi,i = wi for additive
weights, and Ãi,i = wi2 for multiplicative weights for all i = 1, . . . , n.
The conditions for a given strategy to be a Nash equilibrium for the above
weighted social distancing game are the same as those for the social distancing game
on an unweighted network as given in Theorem 2.1, except that the adjacency matrix
A is replaced by the weighted adjacency matrix Ã. We state these conditions in the
following theorem as a reference without repeating the proof.
13

Theorem 4.1. Let Ã be the weighted adjacency matrix of network G. Then, a
strategy x∗ ∈ S is a Nash equilibrium of the weighted social distancing game on G if
and only if there is a scalar λ∗ such that pi (x∗ ) = λ∗ for all i such that x∗i > 0 and
pi (x∗ ) ≥ λ∗ for all i such that x∗i = 0, where pi (x∗ ) = Σj Ãi,j x∗j .
Note that the first set of conditions, which we call the equality conditions, requires
the social contacts on all selected nodes to be equal; and the second set, which we
call the inequality conditions, requires the social contacts on the unselected nodes to
be no less than those on the selected ones; and in either case, the social contacts are
weighted by the weights on the corresponding network sites.
In a weighted network, an optimal distancing strategy can also be obtained by
distancing on a maximal independent set of social sites, i.e., with a maximal independent set as the supporting subnetwork. However, the distribution of the frequencies
over the selected sites is not necessarily uniform any more, for the social sites are all
weighted by the contact values. Also, the inequality conditions for the strategy are
not necessarily satisfied automatically, either:
Theorem 4.2. Let x∗ ∈ S be a strategy for the weighted social distancing game
on G = (V, E), with Ã = (AW + W A)/2. Let G∗ = (V ∗ , E ∗ ) be the supporting
subnetwork for x∗ . Then, if G∗ is a maximal independent set of G and if for any
i ∈ V \V ∗ , there is j ∈ V ∗ such that (i, j) ∈ E and wi ≥ wj , x∗ is a Nash equilibrium
for the game, with x∗i = w̄/wi for all i ∈ V ∗ and x∗i = 0 for all i ∈ V \V ∗ , where
1/w̄ = Σi∈V ∗ 1/wi .
Proof. Since G∗ supports x∗ , x∗i > 0 for all i ∈ V ∗ and x∗i = 0 for all i ∈ V \V ∗ .
Also, Ãi,i = wi for all i ∈ V ∗ , and Ãi,j = 0 for all i, j ∈ V ∗ , i 6= j. Let pi (x∗ ) =
Σj∈V ∗ Ãi,j x∗j = λ∗ for all i ∈ V ∗ . Then, Ãi,i x∗i = λ∗ , i.e., wi x∗i = λ∗ , for all i ∈ V ∗ .
Since Σi∈V ∗ x∗i = 1, λ∗ = w̄ and x∗i = λ∗ /wi = w̄/wi for all i ∈ V ∗ . Since for any
i ∈ V \V ∗ , there is l ∈ V ∗ such that (i, l) ∈ E and wi ≥ wl , Ãi,l = (wi + wl )/2 ≥ wl .
Therefore, for any i ∈ V \V ∗ ,
pi (x∗ ) = Σj∈V ∗ Ãi,j x∗j = Σj∈V ∗ ,(i,j)∈E (wi + wj )x∗j /2
≥ (wi + wl )x∗l /2 ≥ wl x∗l = w̄ = λ∗ .
By Theorem 4.1, x∗ is a Nash equilibrium.
Theorem 4.3. Let x∗ ∈ S be a strategy for the weighted social distancing game
on G = (V, E), with Ã = W AW . Let G∗ = (V ∗ , E ∗ ) be the supporting subnetwork for
x∗ . Then, if G∗ is a maximal independent set of G and if for any i ∈ V \V ∗ , there is
j ∈ V ∗ such that (i, j) ∈ E and wi ≥ wj , x∗ is a Nash equilibrium for the game, with
x∗i = w̃2 /wi2 for all i ∈ V ∗ and x∗i = 0 for all i ∈ V \V ∗ , where 1/w̃2 = Σi∈V ∗ 1/wi2 .
Proof. Since G∗ supports x∗ , x∗i > 0 for all i ∈ V ∗ and x∗i = 0 for all i ∈ V \V ∗ .
Also, Ãi,i = wi for all i ∈ V ∗ , and Ãi,j = 0 for all i, j ∈ V ∗ , i 6= j. Let pi (x∗ ) =
Σj∈V ∗ Ãi,j x∗j = λ∗ for all i ∈ V ∗ . Then, Ãi,i x∗i = λ∗ , i.e., wi2 x∗i = λ∗ , for all i ∈ V ∗ .
Since Σi∈V ∗ x∗i = 1, λ∗ = w̃2 and x∗i = λ∗ /wi2 = w̃2 /wi2 for all i ∈ V ∗ . Since for
any i ∈ V \V ∗ , there is l ∈ V ∗ such that (i, l) ∈ E and wi ≥ wl , Ãi,l = wi wl ≥ wl2 .
Therefore, for any i ∈ V \V ∗ ,
pi (x∗ ) = Σj∈V ∗ Ãi,j x∗j = Σj∈V ∗ ,(i,j)∈E wi wj x∗j
≥ wi wl x∗l ≥ wl2 x∗l = w̃2 = λ∗ .
By Theorem 4.1, x∗ is a Nash equilibrium.
14

Note that the above two theorems show that an optimal strategy x∗ supported
by a maximal independent set has x∗i = w̄/wi for networks with additive weights
and x∗i = w̃2 /wi2 for networks with multiplicative weights. In either case, xi , the
frequency of visiting or staying at social site i, is inversely proportional to wi , the
contact value of social site i. This implies that the larger the contact value at a given
social site, the smaller the corresponding visiting frequency, and hence the probable
fraction of the population at the site. In addition, the total amount of social contacts
every individual can make at equilibrium is given by the parameter λ∗ , which is equal
to w̄ for networks with additive weights and to w̃2 for networks with multiplicative
weights. In either case, the larger the number of nodes in the supporting subnetwork
or the lighter the assigned weights, the smaller the λ∗ value, i.e., the minimal social
contacts at equilibrium.
As an example, consider the network in Figure 4. Assume that the nodes in
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} are all assigned a weight 2, i.e., w1 = w2 = w3 = w4 = w5 = 2, and the
nodes in {6, 7, 8, 9, 10} are all assigned a weight 1, i.e., w6 = w7 = w8 = w9 = w10 =
1. Consider three maximal independent sets of the network, {3, 5, 9}, {4, 6, 7}, and
{3, 5, 6, 7}. Assume that the additive weights are used for the calculation of the social
contacts. First, for {3, 5, 9}, λ∗ = w̄ = 1/(1/w3 + 1/w5 + 1/w9 ) = 1/(1/2 + 1/2 + 1) =
1/2. Let x∗3 = w̄/w3 = 1/4, x∗5 = w̄/w5 = 1/4, x∗9 = w̄/w9 = 2/4, and x∗i = 0 for
all i 6= 3, 5, 9. Then, x∗ satisfies the equality conditions in Theorem 4.1. However,
for i = 8, pi (x∗ ) = (w8 + w3 )x∗3 /2 = 3/8 < 1/2 = λ∗ . Then, x∗ violates the
inequality conditions in Theorem 4.1, and therefore cannot be a Nash equilibrium.
Second, for {4, 6, 7}, λ∗ = w̄ = 1/(1/w4 + 1/w6 + 1/w7 ) = 1/(1/2 + 1 + 1) = 2/5.
Let x∗4 = w̄/w4 = 1/5, x∗6 = w̄/w6 = 2/5, x∗7 = w̄/w7 = 2/5, and x∗i = 0 for
i 6= 4, 6, 7. Also, for any i 6= 4, 6, 7, there is a node l ∈ {4, 6, 7} such that i and l are
connected and wi ≥ wl . Therefore, by Theorem 4.2, x∗ is a Nash equilibrium, with
the total amount of social contacts minimized to λ∗ = 2/5. Third, for {3, 5, 6, 7},
λ∗ = w̄ = 1/(1/w3 + w5 + 1/w6 + 1/w7 ) = 1/(1/2 + 1/2 + 1 + 1) = 1/3. Let
x∗3 = w̄/w3 = 1/6, x∗5 = w̄/w5 = 1/6, x∗6 = w̄/w6 = 2/6, x∗7 = w̄/w7 = 2/6, and
x∗i = 0 for i 6= 3, 5, 6, 7. Also, for any i 6= 3, 5, 6, 7, there is a node l ∈ {3, 5, 6, 7} such
that i and l are connected and wi ≥ wl . Therefore, by Theorem 4.2, x∗ is a Nash
equilibrium, with the total amount of social contacts minimized to λ∗ = 1/3.
The strategies on a general maximal r-regular subnetwork are more complicated if
the subnetwork has arbitrary weights assigned. However, they can still be determined
easily, if the weights are the same for all the nodes in each connected component of the
subnetwork. For the following two theorems, we therefore assume that the supporting subnetwork G∗ is a maximal r-regular subnetwork and consists of m connected
components G∗1 , . . . , G∗m . For each component Gk , a weight wk0 is assigned to all its
nodes.
Theorem 4.4. Let x∗ ∈ S be a strategy for the weighted social distancing game on
G = (V, E), with Ã = (AW +W A)/2. Let G∗ = (V ∗ , E ∗ ) be the supporting subnetwork
for x∗ . Assume that G∗ consists of m connected components G∗k = (Vk∗ , Ek∗ ), each
assigned a weight wk0 , k = 1, . . . , m. Then, if G∗ is a maximal r-regular subnetwork
and if for any node i ∈ V \V ∗ , there are at least r +1 nodes j ∈ V ∗ such that (i, j) ∈ E
and wi ≥ wj , x∗ is a Nash equilibrium for the game, with x∗i = w̄/wk0 for all i ∈ Vk∗ ,
k = 1, . . . , m, and x∗i = 0 for all i ∈ V \V ∗ , where 1/w̄ = Σk mk /wk0 , with mk being
the size of Vk∗ .
Proof. Since G∗ supports x∗ , x∗i > 0 for all i ∈ V ∗ and x∗i = 0 for all i ∈ V \V ∗ .
It follows that pi (x∗ ) = Σj Ãi,j x∗j = Σj∈Vk∗ Ãi,j x∗j = wk0 Σ(i,j)∈Ek∗ x∗j for all i ∈ Vk∗ . Let
15

wk0 Σ(i,j)∈Ek∗ x∗j = λ∗ for all i ∈ Vk∗ . By adding the equations for all i ∈ Vk∗ , we obtain
wk0 (r + 1)Σj∈Vk∗ x∗j = mk λ∗ . By adding the latter equations for all k, we then obtain
λ∗ = (r +1)w̄. By solving the equations for x∗i , we also have x∗i = w̄/wk0 for all i ∈ Vk∗ .
Note that for any node i ∈ V \V ∗ ,
pi (x∗ ) = Σj Ãi,j x∗j = Σk Σj∈Vk∗ Ãi,j x∗j
= Σk Σj∈Vk∗ ,(i,j)∈E (wi + wj )x∗j /2.
Since there are at least r + 1 nodes l ∈ V ∗ such that (i, l) ∈ E and wi ≥ wl ,
pi (x∗ ) ≥ Σk Σl∈Vk∗ ,(i,l)∈E (wi + wl )x∗l /2
≥ Σk Σl∈Vk∗ ,(i,l)∈E wl x∗l
= Σk Σl∈Vk∗ ,(i,l)∈E w̄ ≥ (r + 1)w̄ = λ∗ .
By Theorem 4.1, x∗ is a Nash equilibrium.
Theorem 4.5. Let x∗ ∈ S be a strategy for the weighted social distancing game
on G = (V, E), with Ã = W AW . Let G∗ = (V ∗ , E ∗ ) be the supporting subnetwork
for x∗ . Assume that G∗ consists of m connected components G∗k = (Vk∗ , Ek∗ ), each
assigned a weight wk0 , k = 1, . . . , m. Then, if G∗ is a maximal r-regular subnetwork
and if for any node i ∈ V \V ∗ , there are at least r +1 nodes j ∈ V ∗ such that (i, j) ∈ E
and wi ≥ wj , x∗ is a Nash equilibrium for the game, with x∗i = w̃2 /wk02 for all i ∈ Vk∗ ,
k = 1, . . . , m, and x∗i = 0 for all i ∈ V \V ∗ , where 1/w̃2 = Σk mk /wk02 , with mk being
the size of Vk∗ .
Proof. Since G∗ supports x∗ , x∗i > 0 for all i ∈ V ∗ and x∗i = 0 for all i ∈ V \V ∗ .
It follows that pi (x∗ ) = Σj Ãi,j x∗j = Σj∈Vk∗ Ãi,j x∗j = wk02 Σ(i,j)∈Ek∗ x∗j for all i ∈ Vk∗ . Let
wk02 Σ(i,j)∈Ek∗ x∗j = λ∗ for all i ∈ Vk∗ . By adding the equations for all i ∈ Vk∗ , we obtain
wk02 (r + 1)Σj∈Vk∗ x∗j = mk λ∗ . By adding the latter equations for all k, we then obtain
λ∗ = (r + 1)w̃2 . By solving the equations for x∗i , we also have x∗i = w̃2 /wk02 for all
i ∈ Vk∗ . Note that for any node i ∈ V \V ∗ ,
pi (x∗ ) = Σj Ãi,j x∗j = Σk Σj∈Vk∗ Ãi,j x∗j
= Σk Σj∈Vk∗ ,(i,j)∈E wi wj x∗j .
Since there are at least r + 1 nodes l ∈ V ∗ such that (i, l) ∈ E and wi ≥ wl ,
pi (x∗ ) ≥ Σk Σl∈Vk∗ ,(i,l)∈E wi wl x∗l
≥ Σk Σl∈Vk∗ ,(i,l)∈E wl2 x∗l
= Σk Σl∈Vk∗ ,(i,l)∈E w̃2 ≥ (r + 1)w̃2 = λ∗ .
By Theorem 4.1, x∗ is a Nash equilibrium.
Note that in Theorem 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, the conditions for any node i ∈ V \V ∗ ,
there must be at least r+1 nodes j ∈ V ∗ such that (i, j) ∈ E and wi ≥ wj are sufficient
but not necessary. In general, the inequality conditions in Theorem 4.1 may need to be
tested. In any case, as an example, consider the network in Figure 5. Assume that the
nodes in {1, 2, 3, 4} are assigned a weight w10 = 3, {5, 9, 10} assigned w20 = 2, {7, 13, 14}
assigned w30 = 2, {6, 11, 12} assigned w40 = 1, and {8, 15, 16} assigned w50 = 1. Assume
that additive weights are used for the calculation of the social contacts. Consider the
maximal 2-regular subnetwork formed by {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16}. Then,
16

w̄ = 1/(3/w20 + 3/w30 + 3/w40 + 3/w50 ) = 1/9. Let x∗1 = x∗2 = x∗3 = x∗4 = 0, x∗5 = x∗9 =
x∗10 = w̄/w20 = 1/18, x∗7 = x∗13 = x∗14 = w̄/w30 = 1/18, x∗6 = x∗11 = x∗12 = w̄/w40 = 2/18,
and x∗8 = x∗15 = x∗16 = w̄/w50 = 2/18. Then, for any node i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}, there are
3 nodes j ∈ {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16} such that i and j are connected and
wi ≥ wj since wi = 3 while wj = 1 or 2. Therefore, by Theorem 4.4, x∗ is a Nash
equilibrium, with the total amount of social contacts minimized to λ∗ = (r + 1)w̄ =
1/3.
In previous sections, we have discussed the rigidity, flexibility, and fragility of
distancing strategies for social distancing games. These properties all depend on the
structures of the supporting subnetworks. Therefore, Theorem 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4
can all be extended straightforwardly to the equilibrium strategies for weighted social
distancing games since the weighting schemes we have considered do not change the
network structures. In particular, for a given r-regular network, if the same weight is
assigned to the nodes of each component of the network, as we have assumed in the
above discussion, we can show that (a) an equilibrium strategy of the weighted game,
with either additive or multiplicative weights, must be strongly rigid if its supporting
subnetwork is a maximal independent set; (b) it is flexible if its supporting subnetwork
is a maximal r-regular subnetwork, r > 0; (c) it is weakly rigid if its supporting
network is a maximal r-regular subnetwork whose components are all minimal rregular subnetworks, r > 0; and (d) it is fragile if its supporting subnetwork is an
r-regular subnetwork, r > 0, which is connected but not minimal, or disconnected
but at least one of its components is not minimal. The proofs follow almost the same
steps as in the proofs for Theorem 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4. We will not elaborate further.
5. Concluding Remarks. Much work has been done in the past on social distancing as a behavioral factor affecting the development of an infectious disease, but
research on how to effectively practice and manage social distancing is lacking. The
latter can in fact be an even more important research subject, for the effectiveness
of social distancing would be greatly undermined if without effective practicing. We
have considered a social distancing problem for how a population, when in a world
with a network of social sites, chooses some sites to visit or stay while avoiding or
closing down some others so that the social contacts of the population across the
network can be minimized. We have modeled this problem as a network population
game with the Nash equilibrium of the game corresponding to an optimal distancing
strategy. The social sites that are selected at equilibrium form a subnetwork, which
we have recognized as a structural support for the equilibrium strategy.
We have shown that a large class of equilibrium strategies can be supported by a
maximal r-regular subnetwork. The latter includes many well studied network types,
which are easy to identify or construct, and can be completely disconnected for the
most strict isolation (with r = 0) or allow certain degree of connectivities for more
flexible distancing (with r > 0). We have derived the equilibrium strategies on (a)
maximal 0-regular subnetworks known as maximal independent sets; and (b) maximal
r-regular subnetworks for r > 0. We have also extended these results to weighted
networks and derived equilibrium strategies with additive and multiplicative weights
on (c) maximal weighted 0-regular subnetworks; and (d) maximal r-regular weighted
subnetworks for r > 0.
We have introduced the concept of rigidity, flexibility, and fragility of a social
distancing strategy, and analyzed these properties for strategies on different types
of r-regular subnetworks. We have shown that (a) strategies on maximal 0-regular
subnetworks are strictly rigid; (b) strategies on maximal r-regular subnetworks are
17

flexible for all r > 0; (c) strategies on maximal r-regular subnetworks whose components are minimal r-regular subnetworks are weakly rigid for all r > 0; and (d)
strategies on maximal r-regular subnetworks with at least one non-minimal r-regular
component are fragile for all r > 0. These results apply to both weighted and unweighted networks.
Our work is a step towards developing a general theoretical and computational
framework for the study of social distancing in networked social environments. It is
however open for many further research efforts. First, new dynamic epidemic models
can be built for populations distributed over social networks as determined by the
equilibrium strategies for the social distancing games. Different from those for well
mixed populations, such models may provide more realistic estimates on various epidemic properties such as contact rates, transmission rates, and hence the infectious
rates, etc. Dynamic models on structured populations are always preferred because
populations are always heterogeneous in terms of physical or social proximities [49].
Second, the network types we have discussed are r-regular networks because they
are easy to identify or construct, yet cover a broad range of networks with varying
degrees of connectivities. However, in reality, the networks may not always be so “regular”. The population may prefer other types of network structures such as spanning
trees, extended stars, or small-world networks, all with low degrees of connectivities
[50]. In addition, the structures may also change dynamically. It would be interesting to find the equilibrium conditions of the distancing strategies on such networks,
including related distancing properties such as rigidity, flexibility, and fragility of the
strategies.
Third, social distancing always brings economic costs or social sacrifices. Different
distancing strategies may have different social or economic consequences [1, 5, 6, 12].
Reducing social contacts is a main goal as far as fighting a pandemic is concerned, but
keeping certain levels of social or economic activities can be important as well especially during a possibly long period of recovery from the pandemic [2, 3, 4]. Therefore,
there must be a tradeoff between choosing rigid and flexible distancing strategies. A
cost-benefit function may be defined as a function of the amount of social contacts of
any distancing strategy. The social distancing game can then be generalized to find
an optimal distancing strategy that maximizes distancing benefits at lowest possible
social or economic costs. Future research along this line can be of great practical
interest.
In this paper, we have focused on distancing strategies on maximal r-regular
subnetworks, which are supposed to be easy to identify or construct [51, 52]. Still,
when a large network is given, it takes time to find a desired r-regular subnetwork.
It is well known that the problem to find the maximum 0-regular subgraph, i.e., the
maximum independent set of a given graph is NP-hard [53]. The problem to find
the maximum 1-regular subgraph of a given graph, known as the maximum strong
matching problem, is also NP-hard [54, 55]. In fact, it has been proved that the
problem to find the maximum r-regular subgraph of a given graph is NP-hard for any
r ≥ 0 [56, 57]. Fortunately, for our purpose, we do not have to find the maximum
r-regular subnetwork. A maximal r-regular subnetwork would be sufficient to support
an equilibrium distancing strategy, which is relatively easier to find than the maximum
one.
Finally, we would also like to point out that the social networking game as described in the first section of the paper has been studied previously as a network
population game in [58]. It becomes relevant when social distancing comes into play,
for the latter is exactly a complementary game to the former. The social networking
18

game has been formulated in different forms and for different purposes in the past. It
has been used for the solution of the maximum clique problem, since the maximum
clique of a given network corresponds to the Nash equilibrium of the social networking game on this network with the largest number of positive frequencies [59]. It has
also been used for modeling the evolution of allele selection in genetic research as an
evolutionary game on genetic selection graphs [60]. The work on the social distancing
game on a network in this paper benefits from many ideas and results coming out
from these previous studies.
