Abstract

This work formulates antiviral repositioning as a matrix completion problem where the antiviral drugs are
along the rows and the viruses along the columns. The input matrix is partially filled, with ones in positions
where the antiviral has been known to be effective against a virus. The curated metadata for antivirals (chemical
structure and pathways) and viruses (genomic structure and symptoms) is encoded into our matrix completion
framework as graph Laplacian regularization. We then frame the resulting multiple graph regularized matrix
completion problem as deep matrix factorization. This is solved by using a novel optimization method called
HyPALM (Hybrid Proximal Alternating Linearized Minimization). Results on our curated RNA drug virus
association (DVA) dataset shows that the proposed approach excels over state-of-the-art graph regularized
matrix completion techniques. When applied to in silico prediction of antivirals for COVID-19, our approach
returns antivirals that are either used for treating patients or are under for trials for the same.

Introduction

The problem of matrix completion has been deployed in numerous applications of computer science and bioinformatics. One can mention, for instance, recommender systems [13], wireless sensor networks [12] and MIMO channel
estimation [73]. Matrix completion also forms the foundation of many biological interaction problems including
gene expression imputation [34], drug-target interaction prediction [24, 16, 85], miRNA disease association [11, 40]
and gene disease association [54]. As seen in the aforementioned studies, matrix completion is turning out to one
of the most promising approaches for modelling biological interactions.
Matrix completion for in silico drug re-positioning is an established topic [24, 84]. In such context, the matrix
rows relates to drugs while the columns correspond to the diseases. The information about a drug being eﬀective
for a disease is encoded with a one into the matrix and zero, otherwise. The matrix is only partially ﬁlled since
information about all drug disease associations are not known. Matrix completion amounts to ﬁlling the missing
entries by relying and interpolating over the available knowledge.
Our recent work [52] introduced a dataset of antiviral drug virus association (DVA). It shows how the matrix
completion framework can be used to computationally predict the drugs that could be eﬀective against SARSCoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), the virus responsible for the ongoing pandemic, COVID19 (COrona VIrus Disease-2019). In the aforesaid dataset, we manually curated drug-virus associations from
drugbank.ca. We collected all the anti-viral drugs proved to be eﬀective against viruses infecting humans along with
the similarity information between the viruses (genomic structure-based similarity) and drugs (chemical structurebased similarity). The dataset contains both DNA and RNA viruses known to infect human beings. State-of-the-art
oﬀ-the-shelf matrix completion techniques were then employed to solve the association prediction problem. It was
found that graph regularised techniques, including similarities based on genomic structure of viruses and chemical
structure of antiviral drugs, performed better than the non-regularised competitors. The most successful techniques

1

were graph regularized versions of matrix completion [51], binary matrix completion [48] and (shallow) matrix
factorization [25].
In this present work, we propose to solve the problem of drug-virus association prediction via graph regularized
deep matrix factorization. We propose a novel theoretically sounded algorithm for this task. Moreover, since our
ﬁnal goal is to repurpose drugs for COVID-19, an RNA virus, we have pruned our DVA dataset to consists only
RNA viruses. DNA viruses are not meaningful in this context [55], hence we will not be considering them in this
work. Furthermore, in addition to the graph based on chemical structure similarity of drugs [52], one more similarity
graph has been built on the mode of action of the drugs. Similarly, an additional similarity graph on viruses is
built, based on the human symptoms caused by the virus’ infection. The current work uses the symptom based
similarities along with the genomic similarities used in the prior work [52].
A prior study on graph regularised deep matrix factorization [49] was based on the alternating direction method
of multipliers (ADMM) approach [76]. A major issue with ADMM is that the convergence guarantees are rather mild
in such challenging non convex scenario. Furthermore, ADMM method requires the resolution of costly inner steps
as well as the introduction of several intermediary variables that may be detrimental to the practical eﬃciency of the
method. Owing to the aforesaid reasons, we propose a novel resolution scheme called HyPALM (Hybrid Proximal
Alternating Linearized Minimization), relying on the recent techniques developed in [14, 7, 1]. To summarize the
main contributions of our proposed work are as follows:
• An original graph structure introducing (i) symptoms based viral similarity in the virus-virus graph, (ii)
mechanism-of-action based drug similarity in the drug-drug graph, leading to the so-called multi graph regularized deep matrix factorization (GRDMF) model; We call the approch GRDMF throughout this paper.
• A novel optimization method, named HyPALM, for addressing the resulting matrix factorization problem
with sounded convergence guarantees on its iterates.

Results
Algorithm Selection

In this subsection, we study the choice of technique to solve the GRDMF problem (10). In the past work [50, 49],
the proposed formulation has been solved using ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers) [8, 37]. We
introduce here a novel resolution strategy named HyPALM. In contrast with ADMM, the iterates of HyPALM
are guaranteed to converge to a stationnary point of the non-convex problem. The HyPALM algorithm steps are
depicted in the Methods section of the paper.
We randomly drop 10 % of association values in the drug-virus association matrix and report the AUC (Area
under the ROC curve) and AUPR (Area under the precision recall curve) on the test entries (averaged over 10
runs of cross validation) after solving 2-layer and 3-layer GRDMF problem with ADMM (ﬁrst two columns) and
HyPALM (last two columns). As can be seen, HyPALM solution gives much better prediction results, for both 2
and 3 layers, and both evaluation metrics . Hence, owing to the better performance and the assessed convergence
guarantees, we propose to retain HyPALM in the remaining of the paper for our simulations with the GRDMF
model.

Evaluation

We compare the performance of our method with other recent graph regularized matrix completion techniques such
has graph regularized matrix completion (GRMC) [51], graph regularized binary matrix completion (GRBMC) [52]
and graph regularized techniques like graph regularized matrix factorization (GRMF) [25]. The authors of [52] show

2

that GRMF and GRBMC perform well in predicting drug-virus association and hence estimating drugs for SARSCoV-2. We evaluate the performance of 2-layers and 3-layers graph regularized deep matrix factorization model
(GRDMF) with the similarities provided by the method from [52] and by the newly proposed models GRDMF-2L
and GRDMF-3L.
To quantitatively measure and compare the performance of the proposed and other benchmark algorithms, we
carry out 10-fold cross validation on the drug-virus association dataset in 3 settings and observe the standard metrics
such as mean AUC and AUPR. The ﬁrst setting (CV1) corresponds to randomly hiding 10 % association entries as
the test set in the association matrix, while the other two settings CV2 and CV3 correspond to randomly hiding
10 % viruses and drugs in the data as test set respectively. Such a validation technique is a standard to evaluate
the accuracy in association/interaction prediction problems [16, 74]. As can be observed from Table 2, both version
of our algorithm (GRDMF-2L and GRDMF-3L) perform much better than the state-of-the-art in terms of AUPR
and gives comparable results in terms of AUC. This metric is more important than AUC because it penalizes more
highly ranked false positives so that only highly ranked drug-virus pairs in prediction would be recommended for
biological or chemical tests. It can be seen that the prediction results do not improve much in the 3-layers version.
Hence, we use the 2-layers GRDMF for further experiments, as it presents lower complexity.

Table 2: AUC and AUPR for association prediction for all techniques under the 3 cross validation
settings with multiple similarities used for drugs and viruses.
Let us analyse deeper the results in Table 2. The dataset contains more drugs (86) than viruses (23). In CV1
settings, when entries are randomly omitted, without skipping drugs and viruses our method performs the best.
There is enough data and hence our method does not overﬁt. The results improve from one (GRMF) to two and
three layers. In the CV2 setting, when viruses are omitted, the size of the dataset reduces. The proposed deeper
method overﬁts and hence performs poorly compared to shallower techniques. CV3 also reduces the size of the
dataset by omitting drugs, but since the number of drugs are signiﬁcantly larger than the number of viruses, the
eﬀect is not pronounced on our proposed algorithm and we see an improved prediction.
We then measure the precision and recall at top k (Pre@k and Rec@k, k = 3, k = 5 and 7) drug recommendations
for viruses while implementing Leave-one-out-cross validation (LOOCV) by hiding (i.e., leaving out) the association
proﬁle of every virus. Performing LOOCV tells us how well is the algorithm doing in terms for predicting drugs for
current known viruses. This is the most realistic setting, where all the drugs and all the viruses (barring the test
virus) are considered. One can see that our algorithm gives comparable precision values and exhibits the best recall
at all values of k. This appears as the most realistic case since, on average, there are 4 to 5 drugs for each virus.

The values for the GRDMF model parameters µ, k1 , k2 , k3 and for the HyPALM parameters α, ϑ have been

Moreover, we set the number of iterations K = 10 in HyPALM, which appears suﬃcient to reach stability of

been reported in Table 4. All experiments have been performed on a system with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 x64-based

Ablation study

In order to quantitatively assess the necessity/importance of each of the similarity models at use, we conducted an
ablation study where we used various combinations of similarity (graph regularizations) matrices within the model
to predict 10 % of the test association matrix, which were randomly hided as test set (cross validation setting CV1).
The results have been reported in Table 5.
Here, S1d corresponds to chemical structure based similarity for drugs and S2d corresponds to the similarity
based on mechanism of action of drugs. Similarly, S1v corresponds to the genomic structure based similarity and
S2v corresponds to symptomatic similarity between the viruses.

for all techniques under the cross validation setting CV1.
Let us make a few observations from this study. Firstly, taking into account the new similarities gives the
best prediction results. Secondly, when we use the chemical structure based drug similarity (S1d ) and vary the
viral similarities from S1v to S2v (columns 1 and 2), we observe that symptomatic similarity (S2v ) yields better
results than genomic similarity (S1v ) and hence contributes more towards the prediction task. Similar behavior
appears when using the genomic similarity (S1v ) for viruses and varying the kind of drug similarity used (columns
4

1 and 4 of Table 5). In other words, our results assess that the new similarities contribute more towards the
drug recommendation and greatly improve the prediction results when taken into account in combination with
the previous ones. Lastly, we notice that simply replacing the older similarities with the new ones (column 3 of
Table 5) improves the results. Hence, this ablation study establishes the beneﬁts of the new similarity models that
we introduced.

Table 6: Top-10 ranked recommendations/drugs predicted for SARS-Cov-2 by the DVA computational methods.
As can be observed, Table 6 reports the drug recommendations for the novel Corona virus (nCov/SARS-CoV-2)
using the proposed algorithm and other baselines. The results from our proposed algorithm are sensible. Ribavarin
is an FDA approved antiviral being considered as a treatment for COVID19 either by itself [35] or as a part of
combination [30]. Remdesivir is a promising candidate for treating COVID19 having shown eﬃcacy against SARSCoV-1. The antiviral has been approved for emergency use by the US FDA [20, 60]; it has been approved by the
drug controller general of India (DGCI) to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 patients 1 1 . The science behind
the mechanism of Remdesivir’s action for inhibiting COVID19 has been thoroughly studied [82]. [80] showed that
Umifenovir (brand name Arbidol) is eﬀective as a prophyalactic against COVID19 infection. It has also found
to be eﬀective in the treatment of COVID aﬀected subjects [75, 75, 72, 79]. DGCI has approved it for phase 3
trials in India 2 . Favipiravir, a Russian drug for inﬂuenza, has also been undergoing trials in Japan; it has been
sent to 40+ countries for COVID19 trials 3 . [63] explains the scientiﬁc reason behind the prospective success of
this antiviral. Baloxavir Marboxil has undergone trial in China for treating SARS-COV2 4 . Interferon alfa-2a in
combination with Umifenovir have been found to be eﬀective against COVID19 infected pneumonia [79]. In silico
docking studies shows the potential of Baloxavir marboxil [59]; [42] suggests that this antiviral can be eﬀective if
administered within 24 hours of the onset of infection. Several in silico docking studies have shown Dolutegravir may
be eﬀective in treating COVID19 infection [4, 39]. Trials for Chloroquine and alternately hydroxychloroquine was
once suspended by WHO based on a controversial article, but they were resumed within a few days of suspension
5
. This antimalarial drug has been found to be eﬀective against corona in multiple studies [19]; the scientiﬁc reason
behind the eﬃcacy of this drug against COVID19 has been explained in [28]. Geldanamycin and Laninamivir,
predicted by our algorithm has not been considered for treating COVID19 patients.
The benchmark techniques GRMC, GRBMC and GRMF have three drugs common to ours – Ribavarin, Remdesivir and Umifenovir. These three techniques also predict an anti-hepatitis C drug – Sofosbuvir; this drug was known
to be eﬀective against the coronavirus family [22]; it’s mechanism of action against COVID19 has also been studied
[21]. Evidence from clinical studies have corroborated the same [31]. GRMC and GRBMC also predicts chloroquine
(as do we); but GRMF is unable to predict it.

Note that the results shown in Table 6 are ranked. The ranking is important, since it gives us a faith in the
eﬃcacy of the drugs. Our method predicts 6 drugs under trial among the top 7. The benchmarks only recommend
3 drugs in correct order. In fact, had we looked at the top 5 recommendations, only our algorithm would have
recommended all of them correctly.
The benchmark algorithms predict three common drugs – Telaprevir [62] , Boceprevir [26] and Simeprevir
[44, 70]. These drugs have the potential to be considered for COVID19 clinical trials. All the three benchmarks
predict the antibody Palivizumab; there is no evidence in medical literature to support its usage for treating
COVID19 patients or using it as a prophylactic. They also predict Taribavirin, which is similar to Ribavirin, and
is used for treating Hepatitis-C; it has not been considered for clinical trials for SARS-COV2.
GRMF predicts a unique drug – Paritaprevir. An in silico docking study [62] showed that it has the potential
for treating COVID19 much like Telaprevir, Boceprevir and Simeprevir.
The summary of the ﬁndings are in the following Table 7.

Only our proposed algorithm predicts 6 drugs that are under trial (Remdesivir, Ribavarin, Umifenovir, Chloroquine, Favipiravir and Interferon alfa-2a). Two of the benchmarks predict 5 drugs that are under trial (Remdesivir,
Ribavarin, Umifenovir, Sofosbuvir and Chloroquine); one of them (GRMF) misses out on Chloroquine.
It is encouraging to observe that all the techniques (proposed and benchmarks) are predicting common drugs –
Remdesivir, Ribavarin, Umifenovir.

Conclusion

AI researchers all across the world are contributing towards ﬁghting COVID19. This is our humble contribution towards the same goal [45, 29]. In this paper, we have proposed a novel optimization approach to solve
the drug-virus association prediction problem. The contribution of this work is two-fold. Biologically, we have
extended the phenomena of solving drug-virus association prediction for drug re-positioning using multiple similarities (graphs) and introduced new similarity measures for both drugs (based on mechanism of action) and viruses
(based on symptoms). Technically, the proposed novel technique brings together the beneﬁts of deep learning
(using deep matrix factorization) and multiple graph learning (by regularization with multiple graphs). The algorithmic solution to the problem, relying on the novel HyPALM approach, does not require the setting of any
extra hyper-parameter and has sounded convergence guarantees. We have made the software publicly available at
https://github.com/aanchalMongia/DeepVir.

Background
Modeling Biological Interactions

A signiﬁcant amount of research has been done in formulating drug re-positioning as a machine learning task.
Various approaches such as network diﬀusion, supervised classiﬁcation, neighborhood based prediction, clustering
and matrix completion have been used in the past to address the said problem. Of these matrix completion
techniques have turned out to be the most promising approach [24]. Various biological applications which model
the problem of drug-re-positioning using matrix completion include:
• Drug target interaction prediction: The problem is to predict interaction score between a drug and target
protein in a matrix assumed to have partial interaction data with drugs on rows and proteins on columns
[43, 25, 47, 74, 51, 85].
6

• Drug Disease association prediction: One predicts the probability that a certain drug will interact with
a disease or not in a partially ﬁlled drug-disease association matrix. [84, 46, 81, 48].
• Drug-Drug interaction prediction: The drug-drug relationship is detected through a symmetrical drugdrug matrix/network [83]. This helps predict drugs similar to the ones known to be eﬀective against a
pathogen/disease. Attempts have also been made to propose a machine learning approach for predicting
drug-likeness of a molecule to distinguish potential drugs from small molecules that lack drug-like features [5].
In addition to drug re-positioning, other biological interaction problems have also be modeled as matrix completion with the common goal of discovering or improving treatment of human diseases, for example we can cite:
• Gene disease association prediction: Disease and gene features are used to learn genes for diseases as a
gene-disease association prediction [54, 78, 36]. This assists deciphering genetic basis of human diseases and
better understanding of gene functions, interactions, and pathways.
• Protein-protein interaction prediction: Interactions are estimated in a protein-protein network [77, 38].
Kshirsagar et al. [38] deploy a matrix completion variant to model interactions between host (human here)
proteins and pathogen (viruses causing infectious diseases here) proteins. This helps identifying the interaction
between viral proteins and the human proteins, enabling deeper understanding of infectious diseases (which
may involve biologically similar pathogens).
Motivated by such works, the problem of Drug virus association prediction was considered in [52]. Although
solvable by any computational approach, the authors propose to tackle it using matrix completion motivated by
the success of matrix completion in the above-mentioned applications.
Among all the methodologies compared in [52], graph regularized matrix factorization based technique (GRMF)
provided the best results for the validation setting where drugs are predicted for novel viruses. This impels us to
come up with an improved algorithm built upon GRMF and leverage the beneﬁt of deep learning and various kinds
of metadata associated with drugs/viruses into the current method to aid drug re-positioning for viruses (including
SARS-CoV-2).
4.1.2

Matrix completion

The goal of matrix completion is to recover all the entries of a matrix given a subset of known entries. Assume that
Y is a masked / undersampled version of the complete matrix X. Then, the problem can be expressed as:
Y = M ⊙ X,

(1)

Here, M denotes the mask which is element-wise multiplied to X and has ones at positions where the values are
known and zeros elsewhere. In general, the problem is under-determined with inﬁnitely many solutions. However,
when the sought matrix X is of low-rank, several eﬃcient resolution methods exist. The simplest of them is
the matrix factorization approach [15, 25]. Although known to work empirically, a theoretical understanding of
factorization based completion is relatively recent [68]. In this approach to matrix completion, X is factored into a
product of two low-rank matrices U and V . Formally, this is expressed as:
Y = M ⊙ (U V ).

(2)

The factor matrices (U and V ) are obtained by minimizing the following objective function:
minimizeU,V ||Y − M ⊙ (U V )||2F ,

(3)

with k·kF the Frobenius norm. The setting of the size of the latent factors U and V allow to impose rank constraints
on their product.
Motivated by the success of deep learning in numerous ﬁelds [64, 67, 61, 53], the shallow (two factor) models
have been extended to deeper versions. The general factorization problem when the matrix is completely observed
have been proposed in [41, 71]. The solution to matrix completion via deep factorization has been proposed very
recently, in [53]. This can be formally expressed as follows, in the 2-layers case:
minimizeU1 ,U2 ,V ||Y − M ⊙ (U1 U2 V )||2F .

(4)

Hereagain, the size of the latent factors U1 , U2 and V control the rank of the resulting product. One can extent
to deeper layer formulations (3-layers and 4-layers) by factorizing X into 4 and 5 matrices respectively. The ﬁrst
7

factor matrix U1 (of size m × k1 ) contains the representation of the row elements while the last factor matrix V (of
size k2 × n) is associated to its column representations in the latent space. The values for k1 and k2 here represent
the number of latent factors, and are typically set using cross-validation.
Matrix factorization yields non-convex optimization problems which may be diﬃcult to solve. A more direct
approach to low rank matrix completion is to directly estimate matrix X under low-rank constraints. Since the
minimization of the rank leads to NP hard problems, one usually replaces it by its convex proxy, the nuclear
norm [9, 10], deﬁned as the sum of singular values. The problem formulation is then given as follows:
minimizeX ||Y − M ⊙ X||2F + ||X||∗ .

(5)

In regular matrix completion, the entries in the unknown matrix are assumed to be real-valued. In communications and signal processing, this is actually never the case as those values are almost always quantized. This led
to the quantized matrix completion problem [23, 6]. One extreme case is binary matrix completion [17] where the
matrix entries are represented by only one bit. Binary matrix completion is particularly appropriate for modeling
biological interactions, so unsurprisingly studies in the past have used it for microbe disease association [65].
In all the aforesaid approaches, there was no scope for incorporating associated metadata, to constrain the
completion problem and reduce the indeterminacy. In problems of biological imputations, there are often several
sources of associated metadata. For example, in drug target interaction, one can compute the SIMCOMP score
between the drugs based on their chemical structure as a drug-drug similarity measure [27]. Similarly, similarities
between target protein can be found a priori by computing the Smith-waterman score between the amino acid
sequences of the target proteins [66]. Studies have shown that the incorporation of associated metadata can improve
the prediction results considerably [18]. There can be several approaches to model the associated metadata, in the
framework of matrix completion. One of the most promising approaches is to model the associations as graphs.
This led to weighted graph regularised matrix factorization [25]. The formulation was expressed as:
minimizeU,V ||Y − M ⊙ (U V )||2F + 2µ tr(U ⊤ Lr U ) + 2µ tr(V Lc V ⊤ ).

(6)

Hereabove, µ ≥ 0 is the parameter penalizing the graph regularization terms, and tr(·) denotes the trace of
a matrix. Furthermore, the cost function in (10) incorporates Laplacian weight matrices Lr and Lc imposing
prior correlation between row entities and column entities, respectively. Those matrices are obtained from known
similarity factors Sr and Sc , according to
L r = D r − Sr ,

L c = D c − Sc .

(7)

Dr and Dc are diagonal degree
P corresponding similarity matrices Sr or Sc , that is, their i-th
P matrices for the
diagonal entry equals Drii = j Srij and Dcii = j Scij .
We recently proposed a deep formulation for (10) in [50] which amounts to solving:
minimizeU1 ,U2 ,V ||Y − M ⊙ (U1 U2 V )||2F + µ1 tr(U1⊤ Lr U1 ) + µ2 tr(V Lc V ⊤ ).

(8)

Graph regularised version of nuclear norm minimization was also proposed in [33] and was employed for drug target
interactions [74]. The formulation is given by:
minimizeX ||Y − M ⊙ X||2F + λ||X||∗ + µ1 tr(X ⊤ Lr X) + µ2 tr(XLc X ⊤ )

(9)

All the aforementioned graph regularised techniques have been compared in our prior work [52] in the context of
drug-virus association prediction.

4.2

Problem Formulation

In this work, we assume the unknown matrix X to be a complete drug-virus association matrix, with drugs along
the rows (m drugs) and viruses along the columns (n viruses). It is a binary matrix with each entry xij either equal
to zero, representing no proven association between the corresponding drug and virus or to one, denoting that the
ith drug is known to be eﬀective against the j th virus. We set Y as the observed matrix, corresponding to a sampled
version from X. The information of the known association positions is encoded in the masking binary operator M .
In our proposed technique, multi-graph regularization is incorporated in the deep matrix factorization formulation with the aim to incorporate the metadata associated with the drugs and viruses in the form of similarity
information as shown below:
minimizeU1 ,U2 ,V ||Y − M ⊙ (U1 U2 V )||2F + 2µ tr(U1⊤ Ld U1 ) + 2µ tr(V Lv V ⊤ ),

with nd and nv the number of available similarity matrices (Sdℓ )ℓ and (Svℓ )ℓ , for row entities (i.e. drugs) and column

and k2 ≥ 1 are the numbers of latent factors assumed to be involved.

Pnd Note
Pnvour ℓformulation relies on the
observation that computing the Laplacians associated to the sums ℓ=1
Sdℓ and ℓ=1
Sv is actually equals to the
sum of all the individual Laplacians involved [51], given by (11).
In our previous work on drug-virus association prediction [52], we only consider one kind of similarity for drugs
(based on the chemical structure of the drugs) and viruses (based on the genomic sequence of the viruses), so that
nd and nv were equal to one. In this work, we propose to integrate a second type of similarities for drugs and for
viruses by taking into account the mechanism of action of drugs and symptoms of viruses, so that nd = nv = 2.
The sought drug-virus association matrix X to be recovered is assumed to be a positive entry matrix with a
low-rank structure as similar drugs are known to aﬀect biological systems (target pathways) in a similar fashion by
having a similar mechanism of action [32], which motivates its formulation as the product of rectangular matrices,
X = U1 U2 V and the addition of the positivity constraint on it.

4.3

Data preprocessing

We deploy the sparsiﬁcation method to process the similarity matrices (as done in [51, 25]) using p-nearest neighbor
graph which is obtained by taking into account only the similarity values which correspond to the nearest neighbors
for each drug/virus. p here is set by performing cross-validation on the training set.

4.4

Hybrid Proximal Alternating Linearized Minimization

The minimization problem (10) is non-convex. The multi-linear structure of the involved operators motivates us
for using the alternating minimization algorithm from [14]. This algorithm has been shown to be very powerful,
in several applications such as seismic signal recovery [58], phase retrieval [56] and hyperspectral imaging [57]. It
can be seen as an alternating Majorization-Minimization (MM) technique [69], including the powerful proximity
operator [3] which allows to stabilize and speed up the convergence. In order to apply this method, one needs to
introduce explicitly the variable X in the problem formulation, as follows:
minimizeX,U1 ,U2 ,V F (X, U1 , U2 , V ) s.t. X ≥ 0,

(12)

F (X, U1 , U2 , V ) = ||Y − M ⊙ X||2F + ϑ||X − U1 U2 V ||2F + 2µ tr(U1⊤ Ld U1 ) + 2µ tr(V Lv V ⊤ ).

(13)

with
The advantage is to remove the complicated nonlinear constraint U1 U2 V ≥ 0 while not deteriorating the solution
(for ϑ > 0 suﬃciently large). Function F is then the sum of convex terms involving only a single parameter, and
a quadratic, thus diﬀerentiable, non convex coupling term weighted by ϑ. We are thus in the framework depicted
in [14] (see also [7] for a particular case with two variables), so that we can apply the block coordinate variable
metric forward-backward to solve Problem (12). This amounts to updating the four variables X, U1 , U2 and V
sequentially, combining gradient (possibly with preconditioning) and proximal updates (see [3] for more details
about the proximity operator). As emphasized in [1], the two ﬁrst quadratic terms can actually be processed either
through proximal or gradient descent updates, without altering the convergence of the method. This nice ﬂexibility
allows us to propose the following alternating hybrid scheme, that we called HyPALM for the resolution of (12):
• (update of X) Here, we perform a gradient step over the ﬁrst quadratic term of (12), followed by a proximal
step over the remaining terms:
B ← X − αM ⊙ (M ⊙ X − Y ),

X ← minimizeZ ϑkZ − U1 U2 V

s.t. Z ≥ 0,

(15)
(16)

Hereabove, ς > 0 is a parameter of the algorithm, and α is a stepsize that must be chosen within the interval
]0, 2[ to secure the convergence of the method. The maximum operation in (16) is taken entrywise, so it is
equivalent to a simple cropping of the negative values.
9

• (update of U1 ) We solve the following minimization problem, equivalent to evaluate the proximity operator
of F restricted to the variable U1 , at the previous version of U1 denoted U1 :
U1 ← argminU1 F (X, U1 , U2 , V ) + ςkU1 − U1 k2F ,
= argminU1 ϑ||X − U1 U2 V

||2F

+

(17)

2µ tr(U1⊤ Ld U1 )

(18)

By taking the gradient of the above expression with respect to U1 equals to zero, we obtain:
(2µLd + ςI)U1 + ϑU1 (U2 V )(U2 V )⊤ = X(U2 V )⊤ + ςU1 ,

(19)

with I the identity matrix. System (19) takes the form of a Sylvester equation for which eﬃcient solvers are
available.
• (update of U2 ) Similarly to the latter update, we compute:
U2 ← argminU2 F (X, U1 , U2 , V ) + ςkU2 − U2 k2F ,
= argminU2 ϑ||X − U1 U2 V

||2F

+ ςkU2 −

(20)

U2 k2F ,

(21)

with U2 the previous version of U2 . This leads to the resolution of the Sylvester equation:
ϑU2 V V ⊤ + ς(U1⊤ U1 )−1 U2 = ϑ(U1⊤ U1 )−1 U1⊤ XV + ς(U1⊤ U1 )−1 U2 .

(22)

• (update of V ) Hereagain, we solve the minimization problem:
V ← argminV F (X, U1 , U2 , V ) + ςkV − V k2F ,
= argminV ϑ||X − U1 U2 V

||2F

with V the previous version of V . This leads to solving the Sylvester equation:
ϑ(U1 U2 )⊤ U1 U2 V + V (2µLv + ςI) = ϑ(U1 U2 )⊤ X + ςV .

(25)

Iterating over the above four steps, with the simpliﬁed setting ς = 1, leads to Algorithm 1, where we denote
sylv{A, B, C} the solution of the Sylvester equation AX + XB = C. The convergence of the iterates to a stationary
point of Problem (12) is guaranteed as a consequence of the theoretical analysis in [14, 1].

Similarity computation

In this subsection, we describe in detail how each of the new similarities between drugs and viruses is obtained.
For drugs, we relied on the chemical structure-based SIMCOMP scores [27] to represent drug-drug similarity as
in [52]. We also integrate an additional type of similarity by ﬁnding cosine similarities between one hot encoded
representation of drug class based on mechanism of action of the drug. Similarly, we used the genomic structurebased d2∗ distance based on ONF (Oligonucleotide frequency) measure [2] as similarities between the viruses. To
obtain the second similarity measure, we calculate the cosine similarity between one hot encoded representations
of symptomatic proﬁles of viruses i.e. symptoms caused by the virus. Both the drug class information and the
ﬁle encoding which symptoms are caused by the virus (metadata used to generate new similarity measures) are
available as supplementary. Hence, the drug similarity matrix (of size 86 × 86) and virus similarity matrix (of size
23 × 23) are ﬁxed and encode the metadata available.
