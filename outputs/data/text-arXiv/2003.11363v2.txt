epidemic in Italy

April 14, 2020

Abstract
We give some numerical observations on the total number of infected by the
SARS-CoV-2 in Italy. The analysis is based on a tanh formula involving two
parameters. A polynomial correlation between the parameters gives an upper
bound for the time of the peak of new infected. A numerical indicator of the
temporal variability of the upper bound is introduced. The result and the possibility to extend the analysis to other countries are discussed in the conclusions.

Introduction

In most epidemics it is impossible to determine the true number of new infected individuals per day. This is the case for the new coronavirus disease, since asymptomatic
people or with very mild symptoms may not seek medical assistance and cannot be
identified [1]. Realistic data are fundamental to understand the epidemic and to steer
the efforts to inhibit the disease in the right direction. Also, the dynamical variables of
epidemiological models usually are linked to, or describe directly, the evolution of the
true number of infected: the comparison with the empirical data may be problematic
if those numbers are not realistic. On this side, researches about the estimation of the
real scale of the epidemic or of the proportion of the asymptomatic already appeared
in the literature (see e.g. [10] or [7]).
On the other hand, under very reasonable hypotheses, it is possible to assume
that suitable measurable quantities are determined by the relative values of certain
characteristics of the population only (in opposition to global absolute values): in this
case the knowledge of only a fraction of new infected individuals per day may still
be useful to estimate some of the measurable quantities. This property (we will refer
to it as “scale invariance”) must be reflected in a scale-independent property of the
underlying epidemiological model. In this paper we assume that the time of the peak
of new infected by the SARS-CoV-2 in Italy has the scale-invariance property. We

are aware of the fact that this assumption can be considered at best a rather crude
approximation to a very complex system of interactions. In our opinion however, when
taken as a working hypothesis, it can provide a well-founded basis, or at least a staring
point, to achieve reasonable estimates. This point of view will be justified further in
section (2) on the basis of the SIR epidemiological model.
Since the start of the epidemic in China, a certain number of studies appeared in the
mathematical community about this subject: the description of the spatial or temporal
diffusion of the infected in given regions [5], [11]-[13], the transmission dynamics of the
infection [8], the economic and financial consequences of the epidemic [2], the effect
of atmospheric indicators on the spread of the virus [6], are only a fraction of the
topics under investigation in these days. A certain number of epidemiological studies
are connected to the SIR model. The SIR model is one of the simplest non-linear
deterministic continuous (in time) model of epidemiology: the overall population is
divided in three disjoint classes: S, i.e. the number of susceptible individuals, I, the
number of infectious individuals and R, the number of recovered individuals. Albeit its
non-linearity, the dynamic of the model is fairly uncomplicated and manageable from
an analytical point of view and displays very interesting and realistic properties such
as the existence of an epidemic threshold (see e.g. [3] [14]).
We must underline that the assumption of the scale invariance is not subjected to
the adherence of the empirical data to this particular mathematical model. The SIR
model is seen here as an instance of the family of models possessing the scale invariance.
The paper is organized as follows: in section 2 the SIR model is introduced and
briefly discussed. In section (3) we analyze the data of the cumulative number of
infected in Italy on the base of two simple hypotheses. An upper bound for the timing
of the peak of new number of infected is obtained. This upper bound is dynamic:
when more data are added to the model in the course of the epidemic it may changes
in time. In section (4) we will discuss the predictive validity of the model on the basis
of a numerical indicator measuring the temporal variability of the upper bound. In the
conclusions we will comment about the results and look for possible extensions.

The SIR model and the scale invariance property

The SIR model describes the evolution of the individuals in the susceptible, infectious
and recovered classes with the following differential equations:

The total population N = S + R + I is a conserved quantity from the dynamical point
of view, meaning that there are only two independent variables in the set of equations
2

(1). The characteristics of this model are well-known and the interested readers can
look for example at the discussions in the classical books of Braun [3] and Murrray
[14]. Here we will make only few observations, relevant for the next sections.
Some authors do not include the denominator N on the right hand side of (1), since
it is a constant and can be absorbed by a re-definition of the parameter r. However, we
will keep it: in this way it is indeed evident the scale invariance property of the model:
if the initial conditions (S0 , I0 , R0 ) are scaled by a common constant factor α, (and so
the total population is scaled by a factor α), the solution is scaled by the same factor.
Indeed it is enough to observe that, if (S(t), I(t), R(t)) are the solutions of equations
(1) corresponding to the initial conditions (S0 , I0 , R0 ), then (αS(t), αI(t), αR(t)) are
the solutions corresponding to the initial conditions (αS0 , αI0 , αR0 ).
Some temporal properties of this model, like the time corresponding to a maximum
in I (the time of the peak of the infected), do not depend on the scaling. This property is
very useful, since the actual number of infected or susceptible (and then of recovered) is
in general not known. The reasonable assumption that the same fraction (with respect
to the total) of infected, susceptible and recovered individuals are known, gives the
possibility, in this case, to compare the measured data with the properties that are
scale-independent.
The solution of the system (1) can be written in terms of just one variable: if R(t) is
known, I(t) can be obtained by the third equation and S(t) from the first one or from
the constrain N = S(t) + I(t) + R(t). If the epidemic is not severe (the number R(t)
can be considered small compared to the overall population), an explicit formula for
the number of recovered can be obtained in terms of the hyperbolic tangent function.
The functions reads as
R(t) = α tanh(βt − c) + α tanh(c)

(2)

where we used the initial value R(0) = 0 and the parameters (α, β, c) can be made
explicit in terms of the parameters appearing in (1). The previous is one of the example
of the so-called s-shaped epidemiological curve (with a “peaked” derivative, the function
sech2 ) that universally describes an infection disease. The value of the number of
infected can be obtained by derivation, i.e. I(t) = αβsech(βt − c)2 . When considering
the cumulative number of infected, R + I, the contribution of sech2 is negligible on the
tails, whereas it is more pronounced in correspondence of the maximum of sech2 , but
it is however small if the value of the parameter β is less than one. In this case, the
value of R + I is well approximated by a tanh formula like (2), with a certain different
value of c. This is what we will assume in the next section.

Analysis of data with a tanh model

The discussion made at the end of the previous section, despite to be very basic, has
the advantage to be manageable and to incorporate the main properties of the SIR
model. It is not by chance that the first application of the SIR model (the Bombay
plague of 1905) by Kermack and McKendrick [9] used precisely the tanh formula above.
In the following we will base our analysis on two hypothesis:
3

(i) We assume that the cumulative number of infected is described by a tanh model.
Although this assumption is coherent with the finding of the SIR model, it does
not depend on the particular dynamical model considered,
(ii) We assume that, whatever it is the underlying model describing the evolution of
the number of infected, this model is scale invariant, in the sense specified in the
previous section.
The second hypothesis is fundamental since we are going to look at scale-independent
quantities: even in the case the measured number of infected and recovered individuals
are different from the actual values, it is possible to estimate these quantities.
The cumulative total number of infected that will be considered in the next lines
are those of entire Italy territory. There are at least two reasons that suggested to not
take regional or local data: the first one is that the epidemic started to spread across
three different regions (Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna) and there could not
be a correspondence between the locality where a certain fraction of inhabitants reside
and the region where this fraction was infected. This is also true at a national level,
but the fraction is assumed to be smaller. The second reason is that a non negligible
number of workers and students moved, just before the lockdown, from the regions
in the north of Italy to their regions of origin in the center and south of Italy. The
possibility that a non negligible flow of infected people passed from the north to other
regions should be taken into consideration. By taking the entire national set of data
we overpass the above issues.
The data can be taken for example from Italian Protezione Civile [15], from WHO
[16], or from Worldometer [17]. The cumulative total number of infected will be indicated by Fn , with F1 = 21 corresponding to the number of infected on 21st of February
2020. The subscript n stays for the number of days from the starting of epidemic.
These data will be opposed to the continuous formula
f (t, α, β, c) = α tanh(βt − c) + α tanh(c).

(3)

The value of β will be taken to be constrained by the equation
α tanh(β − c) + α tanh(c) = F1 .

(4)

The function f (3) then depends on two parameters, α and c. When necessary, to
stress the dependence on these parameters, we will denote the function with fα,c (t).
The cumulative final number of infected expected from formula (3) is given by f∞ =
α(1 + tanh(c)). It is possible to estimate the parameters α and c by minimizing the
difference between the actual and predicted number of cases, i.e. minimizing
Sn =

n
X

(Fn − f (n))2

(5)

i=2

In order to have a reasonable minimum number of data, we start the analysis by taking
n ≥ 15. The values of the parameters minimizing the sum Sn are reported in table (1)1
1

Some values are slightly different from those of the first preprint version of the paper since some
data on the cumulative number of infected Fn have been corrected according to [17].

Table 1: the estimated values of αn and cn
A plot of dfα42 ,c42 /dt and of Fn+1 − Fn is reported in figure (1). A fundamental
observation is that the function Sn actually has a basin of depressed values, showed in
detail in figure (2) for a given value of n. This basin of minimum seems to indicate that
there is a given function α(c) giving a family of tanh curves with reduced values of Sn .
The curve α(c) is quite stable by varying n (see section (4)) and suggests to look at
the values of αn as functions of cn . In figure (3) we report the plot of the values of αn
and cn given in table (1) as a function of n, whereas in figure (4) the plot of the values
(cn , αn ). The values of αn vs cn , as explained above, describe the basin of depressed
values for Sn as a function of α(c). We make a cubic fit, with linear coefficients, in
order to get a rough description of the curve α(c):
α=

Clearly, by considering a number N of values of αn and cn to fit ak , k=0,...,3, we will
obtain a set of values {ak,N }. By fitting all the data available (i.e. by taking N = 28),
we get the following values for the coefficients ak :
a0 = −999707, a1 = 1077192, a2 = −389358, a3 = 47555.

(7)

It is possible to get more terms in the sum (6), but the cubic term is sufficient to get
a formula accurate enough to what we are going to say.
The
P3plot ofk the fit is given in figure (5), together with the values of the residuals
αn − k=0 ak cn , where the values ak are those given in equation (7). A comparison
between the curve α(c) and the basin of minima for Sn has been plotted in figure (6):
the red curve is the function (6) with the black dots giving the actual values of (cn , αn )
in table (1).

The function α(c) denotes a trend in the data that may be useful. If in the next
days the values of the infection continue to rise, it is reasonable to expect that the
values of α and c will be constrained closely by the same curve. Clearly the model used
here is rough, but it can give at least an idea about the future trend of the data. We
are tacitly assuming that there will be no other cluster of infection around Italy in the
next days: the point will be discussed later.
Now we consider the function f in (3) as a function of t and c alone, since the
value of a is constrained by the curve (6). The plot of the derivative of this function
(with respect to t) gives the time of the peak of infections. The plot is reported in
figure (7): we notice that the maximum of the derivative of the cumulative number of
infected increases with n up to c ∼ 4.3 and then decreases by increasing c. This gives
an upper bound for the peak of new number of infected (the point where the second
derivative of f (t) (3) is zero), given by 36 days after the data corresponding to F1 (21st
of February).

Temporal variability of the upper bound

The basin of minimum of Sn , for each fixed n, is described by a function gn = α(c):
this function gives a family of tanh curves with reduced values of Sn . The curve α(c)
has been described in the previous section by fitting the values of αn and cn in table
(1) with a cubic formula. We obtained just one curve by making use of all the data
available, i.e. 28 couples (cn , αn ). It is possible to ask how the curves gn (c) depend on
the number of the data available: if the curves gn have a temporal stability, then they
can be used to make a reliable estimation of the time of the peak of new infected. To

corresponding values of maxima as a function of n and c (the points where the second
derivative of f (t) vanishes) (right).
address this question we fit the data (ci , αi ), with the index i from 15 to N , by varying
the number of data taken (i.e. by varying N ). The fit is again cubic, like in (6). In
this way we follow the temporal variation of the curve gN (c). In plot (8) we report the
curves gN (c) for N in the interval [30, 42]: these are the last thirteen curves (in order of
time). It is possible to see that indeed the convexity of the curves is slowly increasing,
so that the differences are more pronounced for higher values of c. To have a measure
of the variability of these curves we introduce a parameter giving the relative increase
of gn (c) for c fixed and equal to the last available value (i.e. c = c42 intable(1))

Conclusions

The above analysis, despite using a rough function for the total number of infected, is
able to give an upper bound for the time of the peak of new infected (27th of March)
thanks to the observation that the values of αn are, in a certain sense, not independent
on the values of cn and are well described by a polynomial interpolation with linear
coefficient. The hypothesis about the scale invariance of the underlying model (that,
we repeat, not necessarily is represented by the SIR model) and the low temporal
variability of the upper bound are fundamental for the accuracy of the result. Another
underlying assumption is that the restrictive measures will be kept and observed in
the next days and there will be no other clusters in the south of Italy (in the SIR

model language, the values of S0 are below the epidemic threshold, see e.g. [14]).
In the unfortunate case that there will be other clusters, it is possible to think at a
substitution of the tanh curve by a combination of such functions: if there are two
clusters of comparable magnitude, then we will have
f (t) = α1 tanh(β1 t − c1 ) + α1 tanh(c1 ) + α2 tanh(β2 t − c2 ) + α2 tanh(c2 )

In a next paper other sets of data, from different countries, will be analyzed.
