Abstract
In this paper, we introduce a novel modeling framework for incorporating fear of infection
and frustration with social distancing into disease dynamics. We show that the resulting
SEIR behavior-perception model has three principal modes of qualitative behavior—no outbreak, controlled outbreak, and uncontrolled outbreak. We also demonstrate that the model
can produce transient and sustained waves of infection consistent with secondary outbreaks.
We fit the model to cumulative COVID-19 case and mortality data from several regions.
Our analysis suggests that regions which experience a significant decline after the first wave
of infection, such as Canada and Israel, are more likely to contain secondary waves of infection, whereas regions which only achieve moderate success in mitigating the disease’s spread
initially, such as the United States, are likely to experience substantial secondary waves or
uncontrolled outbreaks.

Background

Since being first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the resulting disease COVID-19, has spread rapidly around the
globe. Without a vaccine or generally effective treatment, the unprecedented international mitigation effort has instead focused on reducing transmission through travel restrictions, mandatory
quarantines, work-from-home initiatives, school closures, and social distancing practices. These
measures have in turn had detrimental effects on economic productivity, job stability, and overall
quality of life, which in some regions has limited public willingness to abide by social distancing
guidelines, even as cases have continued to rise. To date, COVID-19 has afflicted at least 20
million people worldwide and resulted in over 700,000 deaths [1].
Mathematical modeling has played a significant role in understanding the primary transmission pathways and epidemiological parameters of the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies have
estimated the basic reproductive number, a key measure of the transmissibility of a disease, of
SARS-CoV-2 [2, 3, 4, 5] and projected the disease’s spread under a wide variety of public policy
intervention scenarios, including variances in social distancing policies, travel restrictions, and
face mask utilization [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Forecasting the extent of the spread of COVID-19,
1

however, has been complicated by many factors, including evidence of asymptomatic spread
[12, 13], issues with parameter identifiability [14, 15], and the uncertain mechanisms by which
social behaviors have altered the spread of the disease to date [16, 17, 18].
Several methods have been proposed in the research literature for incorporating and evaluating the role of social perception and behavior changes in dynamical models of emerging infectious
disease (see the excellent review paper [19]). The papers [20, 21, 22] incorporate social behavior changes into an SIR compartmental model by dividing the susceptible and infectious classes
into individuals who initiate behavior changes to reduce transmission and those who do not,
and allowing behavior change to transmit through social contact like a contagion. The papers
[23, 24, 25, 26, 27] instead incorporate social distancing behavior by allowing perception to evolve
as an independent state-dependent variable and having it feedback directly into the transmission
rate. Other studies have focused on regional movement patterns, effectiveness of social distancing, and the summer release of school children followed by their return to classes in the fall [28].
The more recent study [29] specific to the study of COVID-19 incorporates public support for
social distancing as a function of both infection level and economic losses.
In this paper, we present a novel modeling framework for incorporating social perception and
behavior (3) into a compartmental SEIR model (1). Our model incorporates the effects of fear
of infection (PI ) and frustration with social distancing (Pω ) on social distancing (ω), and the
effects of social distancing on disease dynamics by modifying the transmission rate (β). Analysis
of the corresponding system of differential equations (4) suggests that fear of infection can be an
effective mitigator of disease spread but that a high level of frustration with social distancing can
overwhelm these efforts and result in an uncontrolled outbreak (see Figure 2). Our analysis also
suggests that delays in social feedback can lead to transient and sustained waves of infection,
even in populations where the disease’s spread is controlled (see Figure 3).
We fit the model to cumulative COVID-19 case and mortality data across several regions:
Canada, the United States, Israel, Michigan, California and Italy. (See Figures 4 and 5.) Our
analysis suggests that, although the capacity for secondary waves of infection after controlling
the initial outbreak is widespread, the magnitude of the reduction in infection after the initial
outbreak is a strong indicator of a society’s ability to be able to mitigate the secondary waves.
Regions which have significant reductions in infection after the initial outbreak, such as Canada
and Israel, are predicted to have modest and controllable secondary waves. Countries which had
only modest reductions in infection levels after the initial outbreak, such as the United States,
are predicted to have large secondary waves which threaten to become uncontrolled outbreaks.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we develop the SEIR behavior-perception
system (4), which incorporates social distancing, fear of infection, and frustration with social
distancing as time-dependent variables capable of influencing the dynamics of disease spread. In
Section 3, we analyze the SEIR behavior-perception system (4) and demonstrate the admissible
behaviors in a variety of parameter regions, leading to controlled outbreaks, uncontrolled outbreaks, and sustained waves of infection. In Section 4, we fit the model to cumulative COVID-19
case and mortality data from several regions to estimate key epidemiological and social perception and behavior parameters of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Section 5, we summarize our
results and avenues for future work. In Appendix A, we present the mathematical details of the
stability results found in Section 3.

Model

In this section, we introduce an SEIR behavior-perception feedback model of disease spread. The
model consists of two parts: (a) an SEIR model for tracking the evolution of disease dynamics (1);

2

and (b) a behavior-perception loop involving social distancing, fear of infection, and frustration
with social distancing (3).

2.1

SEIR Model

We consider the classic SEIR model where the population is divided in four compartments: S Susceptible to infection; E - Exposed to infection but not yet symptomatic; I - Actively infectious;
R - Removed from the infection [30]. This gives the following model:

Susceptible
(S)

β

Exposed
(E)

Infectious
(I)

λ

γ

Removed
(R)

(1)

For simplicity, we assume that only actively infectious individuals can transmit the infection to
susceptible individuals, although we note that asymptomatic spread is suspected in COVID-19
[12, 13]. We assume that removed individuals cannot become susceptible to the illness again. It
is currently unclear whether COVID-19 may be contracted multiple times but reinfection is not
believed to be a significant factor in disease spread [31].
The dynamics of the system (1) can be modeling by the following SEIR system:

where the parameters are as in Table 3. Notice that the recovery/infectious period γ −1 is the
expected number of days until an individual is no longer infectious, regardless of whether that
is a result of recovery, death, quarantine, or another means.
Although the SEIR system (2) cannot be solved explicitly, the dynamics are well-understood.
Trajectories with non-negative initial conditions stay non-negative and satisfy the population
size conservation equation N = S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t). Trajectories asymptotically approach

The value of R∗ is the extent of the disease since it corresponds to the number of people who
contracted the disease during its course.
The critical parameter for determining whether a disease will spread or die in a population is
the basic reproductive number, R0 , which quantifies the expected number of secondary infections
produced by one active infection entering a fully susceptible population. When R0 > 1 we
expect an outbreak and when R0 < 1 we expect no outbreak. For the SEIR model (1) and
corresponding system (2), the basic reproductive number is R0 = βγ , which can be calculated
using the next-generation method [32, 33, 34]. It follows that there will be an outbreak in (2) if
β > γ while the disease will dissipate without an outbreak if β < γ.

2.2

SEIR Model With Behavior-Perception Feedback

The SEIR model (1) by itself does not account for the possibility that individuals may alter their
behavior, and therefore the disease’s trajectory, in response to the disease’s spread. Since there
is no vaccine or generally effective treatment for the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, mitigation
efforts have necessarily focused on modifications to social behavior such as social distancing,
hand washing, and face mask utilization.
We extend the SEIR model (2) to incorporate the effects of social perception and behavior
change over time. We introduce the following time-dependent variables: social distancing behavior (0 ≤ ω ≤ 1); perceived fear of infection (0 ≤ PI ≤ 1); and perceived frustration with social
distancing (0 ≤ Pω ≤ 1) and assume the following network of dependencies:

Each arrow indicates how the first quantity influences the second, with a positive label (+)
indicating a positive influence and (-) indicating a negative influence.
We now extend the SEIR system (2) to include social perceptions and behavior. We assume
that the rates of changes of ω, PI , and Pω are influenced by variables with arrows leading to
it in (3) and that, in the absence of disease, ω, PI , and Pω will decay to zero. This gives the
following SEIR behavior-perception system:

Notice that the social perception variables PI and Pω influence the social behavior variable ω
which in turn influences the effective transmission rate β(1 − ω), as outlined in (3). Notice also
that we use the daily number of new active cases λE as the catalyst for social perception change
rather than the number of current active infections I, as used in [29]. We believe λE correlates
better with publicly reported case incidence data than the current infection level I.

Table 1: Variables and parameters for the SEIR system (2) and the SEIR behavior-perception system
(4). The parameters kω , kPI , and kPω control the rate of social perception and behavior change. The
parameter M > 0 is the threshold level of new infections governing social perception change while
q ≥ 1 controls the steepness of the switch from low perceived fear of infection to high perceived fear of
infection through the Hill function (6). The value of ω ∗ controls the extent to which frustration with
social distancing reduces social distancing behavior.

Figure 1: The relationship between new daily infections (λE) and social distancing (ω) in the SEIR behaviorperception model (4), assuming the social perception and behavior variables ω, PI , and Pω are at quasi-steady
state (8). On the left, we take M = 50, ω ∗ = 0, and vary q. As q increases, the response of social distancing to
new infections becomes sharper. On the right, we take M = 50, q = 5, and vary ω ∗ . As ω ∗ increases, the effective
level of social distancing decreases even when the level of new infections is high (λE > M ). Note that enforcing
the bounds ω ∗ ∈ [0, 1] guarantees ω(t) ∈ [0, 1] for all t ≥ 0 but that the social distancing response (8) has a lower
bound of 0.5 even when new infections are high. To obtain a fully saturated quasi-steady state ω value lower than
0.5, we can take ω ∗ > 1 but note that this may yield a negative transient ω(t) value.

We use a Hill function [35] on the level of new infections λE to control the perceived fear of
infection (6) and note that this function become more “switch-like” around the threshold value
M as q grows (see Figure 1). The parameters kω , kPI , kPω , q, M , and ω ∗ are as in Table 3.
To further illustrate how social perception and behavior influences disease dynamics, we take
ω, PI , and Pω at quasi-steady state in (4). This gives the following relationship for the level of
new daily infections λE on the social distancing variable ω:

Model Analysis

In this section, we analyze the SEIR behavior-perception system (4) by considering reduced
models which simulate the early-stage dynamics of the outbreak. We show that there are three
dominants modes of behavior—no outbreak, controlled outbreak, and uncontrolled outbreak. We
also show that the system (4) has the capacity for transient and sustained waves of infection,
and investigate how this depends upon the delays in the social perception and behavior changes.

3.1

Reduced Models

We reduce the behavior-perception model (4) to consider the early-stage dynamics when nearly
everyone in the population is susceptible to illness. To accomplish this, we set S = N and remove
the equations for S and R. To further investigate the mechanisms which contribute to secondary
waves of infection, we consider three scenarios on the delays in social perception—no delays, one
delay, and two delays. In all cases, we state the model with frustration with social distancing
included but can remove this variable by taking ω ∗ = 0.
Model I: No delays. We assume that the social perception and behavior variables in (4)
operate on a significantly faster time scale than the disease dynamic variables. On the slow-time
scale of the disease dynamics variables, this corresponds to taking ω, PI , and Pω in (4) at steady
state, which yields (8). Substituting (8) into (4) and removing S and R gives the following
reduced no delay SEIR behavior-perception system:

The behavior of this model is a reasonable approximation of that of (4) so long as the outbreak
remains small (S ≈ N ) and the social perceptions and behavior variables evolve on a significantly
faster time-scale than the disease dynamics variables.
Model II: One delay. We assume that fear of infection evolves on a faster time scale than
the remainder of the variables, which corresponds to taking PI at steady state in (4). After

6

removing S and R, this gives the reduced one delay SEIR behavior-perception system:

(10)

This model approximates (4) when the outbreak remains small (S ≈ N ) and social perception of
the disease evolves on a significantly faster time-scale than social behavior change or frustration
due to social distancing. This is appropriate in societies where information is readily available
due to media and other vectors of mass communication, but will or capability to change social
behavior is limited.
Model III: Two delays. We remove S and R but do not assume any social perception or
behavior variables operate on a significantly faster time scale than the disease spread variables.
This gives the reduced two delay SEIR behavior-perception system:

dt
This model is the closest approximation of (4) since it only assumes that changes in S occur on a
slower time scale than the remainder of the variables. The system (11) is appropriate for studying
the early stages of an outbreak, diseases which are not easily transmitted, or diseases which are
significant controlled through social intervention and never enter a mode of true outbreak.

3.2

Controlled and Uncontrolled Outbreaks

The primary epidemiological parameter for determining whether an outbreak will occur is the
basic reproductive number R0 . This value corresponds to the expected number of secondary
infections resulting from a single primary infection in a fully susceptible population (i.e. early
in an outbreak when S ≈ N ). Consequently, when R0 < 1 it is predicted that the disease will
die off before an outbreak occurs, while if R0 > 1 it is predicted that the disease will spread.
To determine the basic reproductive number, we consider the disease-free steady state
¯ ω̄, P¯I , P¯ω )df = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0) of the reduced models (9), (10), and (11), and apply the next(Ē, I,
generation method [32, 33, 34]. We will use this single steady state for all three reduced models by
restricting to the relevant model variables as required. For all three models, it can be computed
that the dominant eigenvalue of the next-generation matrix at the disease-free state is βγ so that
R0 = βγ . It follows that the disease will die off if β < γ and we will have an outbreak if β > γ.
The reduced models (9), (10), and (11) also have an endemic steady state, which is given by

Notice that the endemic steady state (12) is only physically meaningful for any of the three

three reduced models by restricting to the appropriate model variables.

but does control the distinction between trajectories in the respective regions.

Table 2: Summary of the analysis of the disease-free and endemic steady states of the reduced SEIR behaviorperception systems (9), (10), and (11). The analysis predicts three distinct modes of epidemic behavior: (a) no
outbreak if β < γ; (b) controlled outbreak if 0 < β − γ < ωγ∗ ; and (c) uncontrolled outbreak if β − γ > ωγ∗ .
The distinction between these three cases on system (4) is illustrated in Figure 2. The analysis also suggests
that delays in social perceptions feeding back into social behavior are required in order to have secondary waves
of infection. In particular, for the two delay model, the endemic steady state may lose stability even when the
outbreak is controlled, which yields limit cycles. These sustained waves of infection are demonstrated in Figure
3. The mathematical analysis and numerically derived boundaries of stability are contained in Appendix A.

The endemic steady state (12) corresponds to a controlled outbreak where the the fear of
infection keeps the spread of the disease from growing uncontrolled (see Figure 2). Notice,

8

however, that if ω ∗ is sufficiently high, the endemic steady state is not physically relevant and
the system exhibits a full outbreak similar to as though no social interventions had taken place.
This suggests that frustration with social distancing can undo the gains in mitigating disease
spread given by fear of infection and the resultant social distancing.
To further understand the behavior of the reduced models (9), (10), and (11), and therefore
the full SEIR behavior-perception model (4), we conduct linear stability analysis on the diseasefree and endemic steady states of the reduced model (see Appendix A for mathematical details).
A summary of the analysis is contained in Table 2. Simulations of the full SEIR behaviorperception model (4) are contained in Figure 2 for various values of the transmission rate β and
sharpness parameter q.
These analyses suggest three distinct possibilities for the dynamics:
(i) No outbreak when β < γ (green in Figure 2). In this case, the overall level of infection
E(t) + I(t) tends monotonically to zero. This corresponds to a disease which is not virulent
enough to maintain presence in a population.
(ii) Controlled outbreak when 0 < β − γ < ωγ∗ (blue in Figure 2). In this case, the infection
nears the endemic steady state (12). This corresponds to a population which, through
social perception and behavior feedback, is able to tolerate a certain amount of ambient
infection without ever fully ridding it from the population.
(iii) Uncontrolled outbreak when β − γ > ωγ∗ (red in Figure 2). In this case, the infection
runs through the population relatively unimpeded and forms a characteristic infection peak.
This corresponds to a population for which the frustration of social distancing is simply too
great to allow the level of social behavior change required to mitigate the disease’s spread.
Note that the parameter bounds for these three cases can be stated in terms of the basic
∗
reproductive number R0 = βγ . Defining Rcrit = 1+ω
ω ∗ , we have that the system (4) exhibits no
outbreak if 0 < R0 < 1, a controlled outbreak if 1 < R0 < Rcrit , and an uncontrolled outbreak
if Rcrit < R0 . Intuitively, diseases with high reproductive numbers require less frustration with
social distancing in order to revert to full outbreaks. In contrast, outbreaks of diseases with low
basic reproductive numbers and high levels of frustration can still be controlled since the disease
does not spread as fast. For diseases with high reproductive numbers, it is crucial that mitigation
strategies are implemented in such a way that frustrations with disease mitigation strategies do
not feedback to cause a decrease in social distancing.

3.3

Secondary Waves of Infection

Significant discussion and public policy planning has centered around the possibility of secondary
waves of infection. It is widely feared that after initial success in mitigating the spread of COVID19, social perceptions and behaviors will change in response to falling infection numbers and
that this will lead to a second wave of infection, and indeed this is suspected to be occurring in
several regions around the world. Given the costs associated with social restrictions, predicting
and assessing the timing and scale of potential second waves of infection is an area of significant
research and concern.
To analyze the possibility of secondary waves of infection in the SEIR behavior-perception
system (4), we further analyze the stability of the endemic steady state (12). The mathematical
analysis is contained in Appendix A and the results are summarized in Table 2. We see that
no oscillations are possible for the reduced no delay system (9), transient but not sustained
oscillations (i.e. limit cycles) are possible in certain parameter regions for the one delay system
(10), and both transient and sustained oscillations are possible in certain parameter regions for
9

(a) q = 1 (No oscillations)

(b) q = 5 (transient oscillations) (c) q = 10 (sustained oscillations)

γ = 0.1, M = 100, kω = 0.05, kPI = 0.05, kPω = 0.01, ω ∗ = 0.25, and N = 1000000 and initial condition
S(0) = 999500, E(0) = 500, I(0) = 0, R(0) = 0, ω(0) = 0, PI (0) = 0, and Pω (0) = 0. Simulations are run for
three cases on the parameter q: (a) q = 1; (b) q = 5; and (c) q = 10. We can see that, as q becomes larger, the
dynamics changes from quasi-stability (Figure (a)), to transient oscillations (Figure (b)), to sustained oscillations
(Figure (c)). This suggests that the sharpness in the feedback from the infection level to social distancing behavior
plays a key role in creating secondary waves of infection.
the two-delay system (11). This analysis suggests that delays in the social feedback and behavior
variables play a key role in the generating the capacity for secondary waves of infection. The
distinctions between no oscillations, transient oscillations, and sustained oscillations for the full
SEIR behavior-perception model (4) are illustrated in Figure 3.

Results

In this section, we fit the SEIR behavior-perception system (4) to COVID-19 case incidence and
mortality data. Data is taken from the database hosted by the Center for Systems Science and
Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University [36]. Model parameters and initial conditions
for ω, PI and Pω were estimated through nonlinear least-squares curve fitting to the cumulative
reported case and mortality data and their corresponding rates of change. We used the built-in
MATLAB functions fmincon and multistart to minimize the following objective function:

rates of change of cumulative cases and death cases. That is, c(θ, ti ) and d(θ, ti ) are the rates of
change of cumulative cases and death cases and r̂ci and r̂di are the actual rates of change from
the data. T is the total number of data points. We chose to include fitting to the number of
deaths to promote constraining the model in the fitting process.
To test the model, we have selected six regions which have experienced different profiles in
how the epidemic has spread: Canada, Italy, the United States, Israel, Michigan, and California.

numbers for Canada, US and Israel are 1.96, 3.78 and 1.53, respectively.

In Canada and Italy, after a substantial initial outbreak, the outbreak has been largely contained.
In the United States, there was a large outbreak in March and April, a moderate dip in May and
early June, and then a larger outbreak in July. In Israel, there was a small outbreak in March
and April, a period of near eradication in May and June, and then a large outbreak in July. In
Michigan, there was an initial outbreak that was largely contained, until early July where new
cases of infection started to increase. California, much like the United States experienced a initial
outbreak followed by a moderate dip in the month of April, and then entered the beginning of
a much larger outbreak. The results are contained in Figures 4 and 5 and parameter values are
contained in Table 3.
Simulated model fits indicate that the SEIR behavior-perception model supports different
epidemic profiles as fear of infection, social distancing and frustration with social distancing
are allowed to dynamically change between 0 and 1. These profiles include controlled disease
incidence with near eradication (Canada in Figure 4), loss of disease control and management
(United States in Figure 4), and disease resurgence in the form of a secondary wave (Israel in
Figure 4).
Figure 4 shows model fits to reported case data for Canada, the United States and Israel.
The model fit for Canadian reported case data shows an initial outbreak in early March which is
ultimately controlled over the following four months. The model predicts stable levels of high fear
of infection while social distancing and frustration with social distancing both tend to sufficient
levels for disease control and near eradication. On the other hand, the United States shows
an initial outbreak which is temporarily controlled until late May. Fear of infection quickly
saturates to 1, while frustration with social distancing slowly increases over time. After the
initial increase in social distancing, the increasing levels of frustration lead to a steady decrease
in social distancing levels which become insufficient for control or eradication and thus active

cases of infection increase. Interestingly, Israel shows an initial outbreak followed by a period
of near eradication of the disease. However, fear of infection and social distancing decrease to

12

insufficient levels too quickly after the first wave of infections and leads to a secondary outbreak.
Figure 5 shows model fits of the SEIR behavior-perception system for Michigan, California
and Italy. Michigan shows an initial outbreak that is relatively under control. However, the
model predicts a period starting after mid-July where social distancing, fear of infection and
frustration with social distancing begin to oscillate, but not to the extend seen in the Israel
model fit from Figure 4. California experiences an initial outbreak that is only temporarily
managed before increasing exponentially. After the initial outbreak, the rise in active cases is
accompanied by high fear of infection and an increasing level of frustration with social distancing.
This leads to a reduction in social distancing. Italy dynamically behaves similar to what is seen
in Michigan and Canada. That is, after the initial outbreak, high fear of infection drives a period
of stable social distancing and frustration with social distancing.

Discussion and Conclusions

We have introduced an SEIR behavior-perception system (4) for modeling the feedback of social
fear of infection and frustration with social distancing on the dynamics of disease spread. We
have shown the following: (1) including fear of infection leads to a controlled outbreak the level
of which depends on each society’s tolerance for infection; (2) delays in the fear of infection can
lead to secondary and sustained waves of infection; and (3) frustration with social distancing can
overcome the fear of infection to lead to an uncontrolled outbreak. Where analytically possible,
we have provided parameter ranges where the relevant behaviors occur.
We have also fit the model to cumulative COVID-19 case data from several regions: Canada,
the United States, Israel, Michigan, California and Italy. (See Figures 4 and 5.) The fits obtained
validate our SEIR behavior-perception model as capable of capturing the emergence of socialfeedback-driven secondary waves of infection. Our analysis furthermore suggests that regions
which experience significant reductions in new infection levels following their initial outbreak,
such as Israel and Canada, are likely to be able to mitigate secondary waves of infection. Regions
which experiences only moderate reductions in new infection levels, such as the United States,
are likely to experience more dramatic secondary waves and are at increase risk for entering into
an uncontrolled outbreak.
Using the full model (4), we estimated the basic reproductive number for Canada, United
States, Israel, Michigan, California and Italy, to be 1.96, 3.78, 1.53, 2.2, 3.62 and 2.51 respectively.
These estimations are inline with other studies [4, 5]. In addition, the time varying effective
reproductive number is now implicitly a function of the social behavior in the population, because
of the incorporation of behavior-perception feedback variables, ω, PI and Pω . This effective
reproductive number may provide further real-time and future insight into not only the disease
dynamics, but the social dynamics that drive the spread of the disease.
The reduced model (9) produces a threshold number, Rcrit > 1 such that when R0 > Rcrit
the solutions become unbounded. This unbounded behavior manifests itself within the full model
(4) as the uncontrolled outbreak which forms a characteristic peak often seen in disease outbreaks.
However, unlike in the reduced model, the full model has bounded solutions, because of the finite
susceptible population. Thus herd immunity ultimately reduces the disease burden to zero and
the disease dies out. These dynamics are illustrated in Figure 2.
The model introduced in this paper presents several immediate opportunities for further work.
1. The model (4) assumes the same critical infection level M for both the ascending and
descending phases of disease dynamics. In practice, however, we have seen some countries
quick to lockdown and slow to open up, while other countries are slow to lockdown and quick

13

to open up, which suggests a different critical value M in the ascending and descending
phase of an outbreak.
2. Currently, our estimates for the social distancing variable ω only come through disease
prevalence. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, however, data on social mobility has
been provided by several sources, including Google, Apple, and the United States Department of Transportation [37, 38]. Further insight in the social mechanisms underlying
disease dynamics might be gained by fitting ω to this data as well.
3. Numerical simulations such as those in Figure 3 suggest that the reduced SEIR behaviorperception model (11) undergoes a Hopf bifurcation as the endemic steady state (12) loses
stability. Numerical results also suggest that trajectories of the reduced models (10) and
(11) are bounded in the controlled outbreak scenario but unbounded for the uncontrolled
outbreak scenario. These results are currently unproved.

Stability analysis of SEIR behavior-perception system

In this Appendix, we provide the mathematical stability analysis for the disease-free and endemic
steady states of the reduced feedback systems (9), (10), and (11). We make use of the tracedeterminant condition for planar systems [39] and the Routh-Hurwitz criterion for non-planar
systems [40, 41]. The Routh-Hurwitz conditions states that a given polynomial has all roots
with negative real part if and only if the first column entries of the Routh-Hurwitz table are all
positive. Consequently, if the Routh-Hurwitz table of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix
has any first column entry which is negative, then the matrix has an eigenvalue with positive
real part.

Assuming that ω, PI , and Pω (if considered) equilibriate immediately, (11) reduces to the following direct systems:

which is only physical meaningful if 0 < β − γ < ωγ∗ . We will consider the “With frustration”
system in (13) and reduced to the “No frustration” case by taking ω ∗ = 0.
We have the following result.
Theorem A.1. Consider the reduced direct SEIR behavior-perception models (13). The following
behaviors are possible:
1. If β < γ then there is only the disease-free steady state and it is asymptotically stable.
2. If 0 < β − γ < ωγ∗ then the disease-free steady state is unstable, and the endemic steady
state is positive and asymptotically stable. Furthermore, trajectories near the endemic
steady state may not exhibit oscillatory behavior.
3. If β −γ > ωγ∗ then there is only the disease-free steady state and it is unstable, and solutions
become unbounded.
Proof. We consider the Jacobian of the system (13) evaluated at the disease-free steady state
and the endemic steady state (14). After simplifying, we have

We have tr(Jdf ) = −(λ + γ) < 0 and det(Jdf ) = −λ(β − γ). It follows that disease-free steady
state is a stable node if β < γ (no outbreak) and a saddle if β > γ (controlled or uncontrolled
outbreak). For the endemic steady state, we have

det(Jend ) =

Since we are only concerned with the endemic steady state when 0 < β − γ < ωγ∗ , we have
that det(Jend ) > 0 and tr(Jend ) < 0. It follows that the endemic steady state (14) of (13) is
asymptotically stable whenever it exists.
In order for trajectories near the endemic steady state (14) to oscillate, we require that
tr(Jend )2 − 4det(Jend ) < 0. To analyze this condition, we compute
tr(Jend )2 − 4det(Jend ) =

[λ(β − γ)(γ − ω ∗ (β − γ))q + γβ(λ − γ)]2 + 4λγ 3 β 2
> 0.

(16)

It follows that the linearized system may not permit oscillations around the endemic steady state
(14) so that (13) does not permit the oscillatory behavior.
To prove solutions become unbounded if β − γ > ωγ∗ (uncontrolled outbreak) we note that
this condition implies that
(β − γ)M q

It follows that, provided E > 0, then we have that E + I is continually increasing for all time.
Now suppose that there is a least upper bound Elim +Ilim > 0 such that E(t)+I(t) ≤ Elim +Ilim .
It follows that E(t) + I(t) approaches a single point on this set and by continuity of (9), this
point must be a steady state. When β − γ > ωγ∗ , however, there is only the disease-free steady
state and this does not lie on this set. It follows that there is not a least upper bound Elim + Ilim
to E(t) + I(t). Consequently, it follows that
lim E(t) + I(t) = ∞.

t→∞

That is, the overall level of infection in the population is unbounded.

2. If 0 < β −γ < ωγ∗ then the disease-free steady state is unstable, and the endemic steady state
is positive and asymptotically stable. Furthermore, trajectories near the endemic steady
state may or may not exhibit oscillatory behavior depending on the parameter values.
3. If β − γ >

then there is only the disease-free steady state and it is unstable.

It is not feasible to determine the eigenvalues of (21) directly. The Routh-Hurwitz criterion,
however, can be applied to the characteristic polynomial of (21). The first two entries of the
Routh-Hurwitz table are 1 and λ+γ +kPω +kω , which are trivially positive. The third and fourth
entries can be expanded and factored into terms which are either positive of contain factors of
β − γ of β − ω ∗ (β − γ) (see supplemental computational material). We notice that the endemic
condition 0 < β − γ < ωγ∗ implies that
γ 
>0
β − ω ∗ (β − γ) > γ − ω ∗ (β − γ) > γ − ω ∗
ω∗
so that the third and fourth Routh-Hurwitz entries are positive. The fifth entry is
kPω kω λ(β − γ)(γ − ω ∗ (β − γ))q
β − ω ∗ (β − γ)
This is positive, so that all the first-column entries of the Routh-Hurwitz table are positive. It
follows that all of the eigenvalues of (15) have negative real part so that the endemic steady
state of (17) is locally asymptotically stable. It follows that the system with one delay is not
consistent with sustained oscillations around the endemic steady state (18).
It is challenging to find explicit conditions on the parameters which guarantee (21) has complex eigenvalues. It can be checked numerically, however, that this is possible. One example set
of parameters is β = 0.2, λ = 0.1, γ = 0.1, q = 10, M = 100, kω = 0.1, kPω = 0.1, ω ∗ = 0.
Substituted in (21), this produces the eigenvalues: λ1 = −0.1, λ2 = −0.1, λ3,4 = −0.1 ± 0.2i. It
follows that the one-delay models (17) permit transient waves of infection.

which is physically meaningful if and only if 0 < β − γ < ωγ∗ . We consider the “with frustration”
case with the understanding that we can limit to the “no frustration” case by taking ω ∗ = 0.
We have the following result.
Theorem A.3. Consider the reduced direct SEIR behavior-perception models (13). The following
behaviors are possible:
1. If β < γ then there is only the disease-free steady state and it is asymptotically stable.
2. If 0 < β − γ < ωγ∗ then the disease-free steady state is unstable, and the endemic steady
state is positive. Trajectories near the endemic steady state may converge exponentially
toward it, exhibit damped oscillations, or converge toward nearby limit cycles, depending
on the parameter values.
3. If β − γ >

γ
ω∗

then there is only the disease-free steady state and it is unstable.

The eigenvalues of (26) cannot be reasonably computed directly. The Routh-Hurwitz condition,
however, can be utilized to determine if the matrix permits eigenvalues with positive real part.
The first two column entries of the Routh-Hurwitz table are 1 and λ + γ + kPI + kPω + kω , both
of which are positive. The third entry can be factored as
−n(q, 1) · q + n(q, 0)
d(q, 0)

(27)

where
n(q, 1) = kPI λkω (β − γ)(γ − ω ∗ (β − γ)))
n(q, 0) = γ(kPI + kω + kPω (λ + γ + kPω + kω )(λ + kPI + γ)(β − ω ∗ (β − γ)) + βγkPω kω (kPω + kω )
d(q, 0) = γ(γ + kPI + kPω + kω + λ)(β − ω ∗ (β − γ))
21

For the endemic condition 0 < β − γ <

γ
ω∗

we have

β − γ > 0, γ − ω ∗ (β − γ) > 0, and β − ω ∗ (β − γ) > 0
so that n(q, 1) > 0, n(q, 0) > 0, and d(q, 0) > 0. It follows that (27) can be made negative by
choosing
n(q, 0)
.
q>
n(q, 1)
In particular, for any values of the parameters β, λ, γ, kPI , and kω we can choose q sufficiently
large so that the first column of the Routh-Hurwitz table has a sign change, so that the endemic
¯ ω̄, P¯I , P¯ω )end (23) is unstable. The value of q increasing corresponds to the
steady state (Ē, I,
social behavior operating more and more like a switch. Independently, there is capacity for a
sign change in the fourth Routh-Hurwitz coefficient; however, the algebra is too complicated to
present here directly (see supplemental computational files for numerical results).
