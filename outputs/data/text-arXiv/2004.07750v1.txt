In the absence of any available vaccines or drugs, prevention of the spread of Coronavirus Disease
2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is being achieved by putting many mitigation measures in place. It
is indispensable to have robust and reliable ways of evaluating the effectiveness of these measures.
In this work, we assume that, at a very coarse-grained level of description, the overall effect of all
the mitigation measures is that we can still describe the spread of the pandemic using the most
basic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model but with an “effective contact rate”
(β) which is time-dependent. We then use the time series data of the number of infected individuals
in the population to extract the instantaneous effective contact rate which is the result of various
social interventions put in place. This approach has the potential to be significantly useful while
evaluating the impact of mitigation measures on the spread of COVID-19 in near future.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Within a few months of its first outbreak, Coronavirus
Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected millions of individuals worldwide and hence, has been recognised as a
pandemic by the World Health Organisation [1]. We are
just beginning to discover various relevant details about
this pandemic and severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus strain that causes
it [2–4]. As of now, no candidate vaccine or drug has successfully completed any clinical trials. Given this, various
preventive and mitigative measures are being practised
worldwide [5, 6]. It is extremely important to evaluate
the impact and efficacy of these mitigation measures.
The most obvious way to answer these questions is
to build elaborate mathematical models simulating the
spread of the pandemic [7–17]. The speed with which
an epidemic spreads is dependent on a large number of
factors. E.g., an infectious disease has certain intrinsic
parameters such as mean serial interval, mean incubation period, mean infectious period etc. In addition, the
spread of the disease also depends on the ease with which
newer susceptible individuals can get infected: this plays
a pivotal role in determining parameters such as the basic reproduction number of the epidemic in a population.
The mitigation measures essentially try to ensure that
the number of contacts between infectious and susceptible individuals as well as the probability of infection on
contact are as small as possible. Modelling the spread
of an epidemic while the various mitigation measures are
being practised is thus a complex task.
Given this, one might ask, if there is a resurgence
of the pandemic, could we use the information we gain
during the first wave, to build better models which deal

with the spread of the pandemic while the myriad mitigation measures are taking place? The present work
deals with an approach which could prove to be useful when we wish to have a coarse grained description
which still takes into account all the different effects
(such as migrations, contact tracing, quarantines, lockdowns, heterogeneous mixing of population, testing of
some fraction of asymptomatic cases etc) which go on
almost simultaneously when an epidemic spreads. We
surmise that, as these myriad complex processes take
place, at a very broad, coarse grained level of description, the dynamics of a pandemic such as COVID-19,
which is known to have some latency period, is still going
to be described by the well known Susceptible-ExposedInfectious-Removed, SEIR model [18, 19] with an effective contact rate β which will be time-dependent. We
shall present a step-by-step procedure by which this time
dependent effective contact rate β(t) can be reliably reconstructed from the time series data of infectious fraction of the population.
We must emphasise that this effective instantaneous
contact rate β(t) is found while all the complicated mitigation measures and social distancing measures are being
practised and put in place. Thus, for a given population
such as a given city, we shall know the mitigation measures taken, and we can use the procedure described in
this work to determine the effective instantaneous contact rate (or one of its smoothed incarnations).
Since the knowledge of instantaneous effective contact
rate lets us reliably calculate the evolution of an epidemic, once this procedure is followed for a large number
of localities (with known mitigation measures), one becomes better equipped in handling the impact of various
mitigation measures: this can prove to be very useful in
planning for future outbreaks.
This paper is organised as follows: in the next section,
we review some fundamentals of SEIR class of epidemiological models and describe how we can connect theory
to observations. In §III, we provide a step-by-step procedure for reconstructing a raw effective contact rate and
analyse the robustness of this procedure. In addition,

2
in this section, we present ways of smoothening the raw
contact rate obtained and mention some applications, in
particular, to the time series data of confirmed cases of
many countries. Finally, we conclude with discussions
about the possible significance of our approach.
II.

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL MODELS AND
OBSERVATIONS
A.

SEIR models: a quick reminder

There exists a very large class of models which try to
mathematically describe the spread of an epidemic in a
population [18, 19]. The Susceptible-Exposed-InfectiousRemoved, SEIR, class of models are some of the simplest and most studied ones. As an epidemic spreads, at
any time t, let I(t) be the number of infected individuals and S(t) be the number of susceptible individuals
in the population. Furthermore, let R(t) be the number of individuals removed from the epidemic dynamics
(i.e. the number of those who have either died till time
t or who have recovered till this time). We assume that
those individuals who have recovered from the disease
can not become susceptible again. Since the functions
I(t), S(t) and R(t) give the number of individuals, their
codomain must be the set of non-negative integers and
hence, strictly speaking, these functions can not be continuous. Moreover, the true dynamics of the number of
individuals during the spread of an epidemic is stochastic in nature. We shall mostly deal with the fractions
s = S/N , i = I/N , r = R/N , where N is total population (which we assume changes only negligibly during
the course of the spread of the epidemic). These quantities also change by discrete amounts but if the minimal
possible change is sufficiently small, we can think of s(t),
i(t) and r(t) as differentiable functions.
In SEIR model [18, 19] of the dynamics of epidemics,
these quantities evolve in accordance with the following
differential equations
s0 (t)
e0 (t)
i0 (t)
r0 (t)

=
=
=
=

−β s(t) i(t) ,
β s(t) i(t) − σ e(t) ,
σ e(t) − γ i(t) ,
γ i(t) .

(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

Here, the parameter γ is known as recovery rate (since
1/γ is the average duration of recovery or average infectious period) while the parameter σ is known as incubation rate (since 1/σ is the mean incubation period).
The values of these parameters, for COVID-19 have been
experimentally estimated (see e.g. [21] and [22]).
The parameter β can be physically understood in the
following manner: in a homogeneously mixed population
(in which everyone interacts with everyone else), if a randomly chosen susceptible individual experiences κ contacts per unit time with other individuals, and if c is the
probability of disease transmission when this individual

comes in contact with an infectious individual, then, the
quantity β is defined by the relation: β ≡ −κ ln(1 − c)
[18]. For sufficiently small c,
β = κc ,

(5)

thus, β is the product of contact rate and disease transmission probability and it itself is often simply called
“the contact rate.” Note that by its very definition, this
quantity can not be negative.
Various mitigation measures will ensure that both κ
(the rate of contact) and c (the probability of disease
transmission) will change. It is this time dependence of
the quantity β which we wish to extract from the data.
Finally, for SEIR models (ignoring the changes in population due to births and deaths), the quantity called
“Basic reproduction number,” R0 , which is the expected
number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection
(however, see also e.g. [20]), is given by
R0 =

β
.
γ

(6)

This can be used to define an effective time dependent
reproduction number R(t) by the same expression. Given
the effective time dependence of β, R(t) defined in this
manner can be easily determined.

B.

Theory and observational data

Let us now connect the theoretical description of the
spread of the pandemic to observations. Let j be an
index characterising the day number, then, the observational data about quantities such as Cj (the number
of confirmed cases of the pandemic till the day characterised by the index j), Dj (the number of people who
have died till the day characterised by the index j) and
Rj (the number of people who have recovered till the day
characterised by the index j), is available.
Note how Cj differs from a discretised version of I(t).
Since Cj represents the number of individuals infected till
day j, it is a cumulative quantity, on the other hand, I(t)
is the number of infected individuals at time t. Given the
definitions of these quantities, one expects that


Ij = Cj − Dj + Rj .
(7)
This can be used to find the number of people infected
on day j i.e. Ij from the observed data. In the next subsection, we will see how this can be used to reconstruct
an effective time dependent β parameter.
In the very beginning, when the very first cases of a
pandemic are observed, the cumulative number of dead
and the cumulative number of recovered are both zero
and at that stage Ij and Cj are identical. As the cumulative number of dead and recovered increases, the

3
difference between I and C also increases, but as long
as the cumulative number of dead and the cumulative
number of recovered are small compared to the number
of confirmed cases, Ij remains close to Cj . At a much
later stage of the evolution of the pandemic, Ij begins
to decrease, while Cj , being a cumulative quantity, never
decreases.
Finally, let us note that, in the discrete form, the SEIR
evolution equations become (for time dependent β),
sj+1 − sj
ej+1 − ej
ij+1 − ij
rj+1 − rj

STRATEGY FOR RECONSTRUCTION

A.

Reconstructing the effective contact rate

Given the time series data of number of infected individuals each day, I, we follow the following simple steps
to reconstruct, not only en , rn and sn , but also the effective time dependent contact rate βn . The method described here can be applied to any population which is
sufficiently large, but, to illustrate the method, we shall
apply it to countries. Here are the steps of the procedure:
1. For any country of interest, we obtain the time series data of Cj , Dj , Rj from [23] and obtain Ij by
following the procedure described in the last section. We focus attention to the data for only those
countries for which the number of tests per million,
at the time of writing, is sufficiently large (at least
a few thousand, see table I). We shall also see what
happens when we do work with the data for a country for which the number of tests per million is very
low.
2. We only begin to use the data from the time when
the cumulative number of confirmed cases is greater
than 25, this corresponds to the day which we shall
characterise by the index n = 1. Let ti be the
day before this. Similarly, let us assume that the
time series data is available till time tf , which also
corresponds to n = nmax .
3. For each country, we note down the date on which
lockdowns began (time tl ) as well as its population
(N ). We can now obtain the values of in by dividing the number of infected by the population.
4. We use the values of the recovery rate γ and the
incubation rate σ available in the literature [21],
[22].
5. At this stage, we use eq (10) to find out en for all n
except n = nmax (since we will not know inmax +1 ).

6. Now we use Eq (11) to find out rn for all n. In order
to do so, we shall need r1 . To find this, we assume
that, for the day which corresponds to n = 1, the
number of removed individuals is equal to the sum
of number of recovered individuals and the number
of dead individuals. We shall eventually see what
happens when we relax this assumption.
7. Knowing in and having found en , rn , we could find
sn = 1 − (in + en + rn ). Since we do not know en
for n = nmax , we would only know sn for n < nmax .
8. Now, use Eq (9) to find βn
βn =

en+1 − en + σen
.
sn in

(12)

Since en is only known till nmax − 1, the maximum
value of n for which we can find en+1 in the RHS
of the above equation must be nmax − 1. Thus, we
can find βn for 1 ≤ n ≤ nmax − 2.
Before proceeding, we note that, from Eq (9), Eq (10)
and Eq (12), it is easy to show that:


1
βn =
in+2 + (γ + σ − 2) in+1 + (σ − 1)(γ − 1) in .
sn in σ
(13)
Moreover, from Eq (6), it is clear that this procedure
will also give us a time dependent effective reproduction
number, R which is defined by Eq (6) but for a time dependent β. As a test of self-consistency of this procedure,
one could check whether Eq (8) gets satisfied, we confirm
that this is indeed the case. The above steps let us reconstruct the effective, time dependent β using the SEIR
evolution equations. This kind of information about the
effective β caused by various mitigation measures is of
utmost importance if we wish to be able to simulate the
mitigation measures: this can in fact predict the long
term spread of the epidemic. In the rest of this subsection, we shall understand various issues associated with
this reconstruction.
1.

An example of reconstruction

Let us look at the results of this procedure for a specific
example case. We first show these results for Italy, for
which, at the time of writing, there have been 18,481
tests per million (i.e. 1.85%) of the population, so that
one can be quite confident in trusting the data. For Italy,
the population (as of 2019) is 60.4 million and, on Feb 22,
2020, the number of infected became greater than 25, i.e.
the day before this date corresponds to the time value ti
(and Feb 22, 2020 itself corresponds to n = 1). Similarly,
for Italy, lockdown time tl corresponds to the date March
09, 2020, i.e. nl = 17. Finally, if we analyse the Italy
data till April 15, 2020, we would have nmax = 54. In
fig (1), we show the result of step 8 above on the time
series data for Italy. It is easy to see that the behaviour

Number of days since ti

In step 6 of the reconstruction procedure, we had chosen value of r1 . One expects that, since the variable rn
does not impact the dynamics of any other variable, this
choice should have no impact. On the other hand, the
value of rn does determine the value of sn which gets
used in finding β. It is thus important to ask ourselves
whether this has any impact on the reconstructed β. We
repeated the analysis for different chosen values of r1 and
found no change in the reconstructed β.

of this reconstructed β (which we call raw β in the figure)
changes after the lockdown, in fact, the average value of
reconstructed β goes down after lockdown. The average
value of β before lockdown is 1.2, while the average value
of β after lockdown is only 0.3.

2.

Remarks about occasional negative values

Looking at Fig (1), it is clear that this reconstruction procedure can occasionally give negative values of
βn for certain values of n: this is obviously unphysical.
From Eq (12), it is clear that this happens whenever
en+1 < (1 − σ)en . 1 In the early stage of growth of
the epidemic, we do not expect that en+1 shall be less
than en . Thus, the occasional negative values can only
arise due to fluctuations. Before proceeding, we must
note that, at a much later stage, we do expect that en+1
will be (typically) less than en , but this also does not
correspond to negative β, it just means that in the RHS
of Eq (2), the second term is dominant.
Since the description in terms of smooth functions is
a coarse grained description of true stochastic dynamics,
the actual evolution of in is not determined by deterministic differential equations (or even difference equations),
it is a stochastic quantity whose evolution is only roughly
captured by these equations. Thus, when we use Eq (8
-11) to determine βn from the data which in reality is
determined not by these equations, but by some stochastic dynamics, we expected that due to the fluctuations,
inferred βn will occasionally be negative. Thus, it is expected that only a smoothed out form of β obtained by
reconstruction can be a sensible quantity.

1

The effect of changing r1

A similar condition for the existence of negative values of βn in
terms of in can also be found from Eq (13).

The effect of changing γ and σ

Till now, we have looked at the reconstructed β for a
fixed set of values of the recovery rate (γ) and incubation
rate (σ). One might wonder to what extent this reconstruction depends on these values. In fig (2), we show
how the reconstructed β changes for various choices of γ
and for various choices of σ. It is clear that the experimental uncertainties in the values of recovery rate and
incubation rate lead to uncertainties in our reconstructed
β. In particular, decreasing the central value of γ leads to
a slight decrease in reconstructed raw β while decreasing
the central value of σ leads to a substantial increase in reconstructed β. This is of course easy to understand from
Eq (13): in units of day−1 , γ and σ are small compared
to 1, so, in the approximation in which we completely
ignore them, βn ∝ 1/σ: this explains the strong inverse
proportionality of β to σ. In order to find the dependence on γ, we can no longer ignore γ as compared to 1,
so, there will be a weak dependence on γ.
As the experimental limits on the recovery rate and the
incubation rate improve, our knowledge of β(t) will also
improve. We also note in passing that the instantaneous
effective reproduction number, R will scale inversely as
we change γ.

B.

Post-processing the raw reconstruction

We saw in §III A 2, that spurious fluctuations and occasional unphysical negative values turn up in reconstructed β because of random statistical fluctuations in
the input time series data of infected fraction of the population. We expect the actual β to be a positive function
of time, and we would like to use a more smooth functional form of β (so that it can be described by a few
numbers). I.e., the reconstruction procedure described
above gives us a raw contact rate βn and we need to find
a smoothed version of β which one can easily work with.
To check that smoothing gets rid of occasional negative
entries, we found the moving average of reconstructed
raw β for a window function of duration three days and
five days. The results of this are shown in the left plot of
fig (3). As expected, moving averages of longer duration
help us in getting rid of not only the occasional negative

values of β, but also, spurious fluctuations. In the left
plot of fig (3), one should also note that as expected, the
data for three-days moving average starts one day after
n = 1 and ends one day before n = nmax . Similarly, the
data for five-days moving average starts two days after
n = 1 and ends two days before n = nmax .
In addition, to describe β by a smooth function, so
that it can be specified by only a few numbers, we fitted
(a) a low degree polynomial to the reconstructed raw β,
and, (b) a “step-down function”, of the form

βstep (t) = A tanh

t − toff
tw

+B ,

(14)

to the reconstructed raw β. The parameters of this fitting function turn out to be A = −0.52, B = 0.70, toff =
18.90, tw = 10.35 while a cubic polynomial fit to the β
turns out to be
βpoly (t) = 1.08 + 0.02 t − 2.72 × 10−3 t2
+ 3.90 × 10−5 t3 .

(15)

Both of these functions are shown in the right plot of fig
(3). The parameters of the step down function are especially noteworthy: toff = 18.9, in comparison, tl (the lockdown day) in this case is 17, also, since tw = 10.35, this
needs to be compared with the infectious period (which
was set to be 7 days for this run).
As we shall argue in the next section, all of these
smoothed out forms of β are as good as the raw β in modelling the effects of various mitigation measures. Any of
the post-processed i.e. smoothed β found here can then
be used to model the actual spread of a pandemic such
as COVID-19.

Simple applications

Using the form of β(t) to find long term evolution

One way to ensure that the procedure described in the
last section is self-consistent, is, to evolve SEIR equations
i.e. Eqs (1-4), for the time dependent β obtained in the
last section. In order to do so, we need to set the values of various parameters and initial conditions in Eqs
(1-4). Needless to say, for γ and σ, we need to choose
the same values for which we performed the reconstruction. For initial condition for i(t), we use the observed
value of i(ti ) obtained using Eq (7). On the other hand,
for the fraction of population which is removed, we set
r(ti ) = r1 , while for the fraction of population exposed,
we use the value of e(ti ) obtained by our reconstruction
procedure. Next we need to use the reconstructed β in
SEIR evolution equations. In order to do so, we can either work with raw β, or, we can work with one of the
smoothed forms of β found in the last section. In fig (4),
we show i(t) found out after using the “step-down” form
of β(t) (defined in Eq (14)) as well as the i(t) obtained
from observations. From the fact that the two curves
are so close, we learn that instead of working with raw
β, we could also work with the “step-down” form of β
in order to find the long term evolution of the infected
population. Similarly, in modelling the effects of various mitigation measures, other smoothed out forms of β
(such as the moving average or the polynomial fit) are
almost as good as raw β itself.
At this stage it is easy to see that one could use Eqs (14), to find the location of the peak, the extent of flattening of the curve (due to mitigation measures) and other
long term effects if the same mitigation measures continue. Furthermore, if in the near future, the mitigation
measures are relaxed, and we wish to reintroduce them

FIG. 4: In this fig, on the vertical axis, we have natural
logarithm of the fraction of infected population i(t). The
red solid curve corresponds to i(t) found by evolving Eqs (14) with a time dependent smoothed out β approximated by
the “step-down function” (defined by Eq (14)). The data
points correspond to i(t) obtained from observations. Despite
replacing the raw reconstructed β by the smooth step-down
β, the agreement between the two is noteworthy.

in a few weeks time, the effective instantaneous contact
rate found by the procedure described in the last section,
can be used to predict how the epidemic will spread in
the next wave.
2.

Applying to other populations

In the last section, since replacing raw βn by a
smoothed β(t) did not have significant impact on the evolution of the fraction of infected population (see fig (4)),
one could simply work with one of the smoothed forms

of β(t). Since a smoothed form of β(t) can be described
by only a handful of numbers (such as A, B, toff and tw
for the step down function or the coefficients of various
powers of t in the (low degree) polynomial function), we
can say that these few numbers carry information about
the entire history of mitigation measures for Italy during
the period of spread of the pandemic. Thus, depending
on the population of interest (such as a chosen country or
a chosen city), and depending on the chosen parameterisation of β(t), we can find the few numbers which specify
the mitigation history. For the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, the social interventions taken up by various countries are very well known and well-recorded (in the form
of public policies, media reports etc). Thus, we can relate
the mitigation measures taken up to the few numbers we
use to parameterise β(t).
Finally, it is interesting to ask how the effective instantaneous contact rates of various countries compare with
each other. For each country, one could either work with
the raw data for βn or with one of the smoothed (descriptions described in the last section). We provide the raw
βn for six additional countries in fig (5) and some useful
basic information about these countries is given in table
I. The parameters γ and σ are both set to be 17 day−1 .
Note that the date on which lockdowns begin are different for different countries, thus, the duration between the
date of lockdown and the date till which data is used in
this work, is different for different countries. Note also
that the extent of lockdowns is different for these different countries. In fig (5), the impact of lockdowns can
be seem from the behaviour of raw βn for all countries
except India. This is because the number of tests per million for India is very low, see table I. Since many of the
plots in fig (5) have several negative entries, one would

DISCUSSION

In the absence of vaccines and treatment for a pandemic, several mitigation measures are taken to slow
down its spread and to ensure that the healthcare system
does not get overwhelmed. These measures include personal preventive measures (such as the use of face masks,
self quarantine etc), social distancing measures (such as
closing down of schools and cancellation of social gatherings etc), travel restrictions, curfews and so on. When
these drastic measures are practised on a large scale, they
often lead to severe socioeconomic disruptions. Given
this, it is extremely important that we should be able to
compare the economic costs of disruptions to the extent
to which the spread of a pandemic can be arrested by
these measures.
This is a task which can potentially be handled by sufficiently well predictive mathematical models of the spread
of pandemics. Needless to say, any reliable forecasting for
a system as complex as a city or a country is a colossally
difficult task. Often, one has to build a virtual copy of the
entire population of interest in one’s simulation, taking
into account such diverse effects as migrations, number
of contacts per day, the effect of testing, contact tracing
etc. Despite this, the predictions of the model depend
on the values of a large number of parameters whose values can only be roughly estimated at best. Moreover, all
of this modelling needs to be done while unprecedented

mitigation measures are taking place. This just leads to
the fact that, typically, models which try to take into
account a very detailed description of the spread of the
pandemic still prove to be inadequate.
While detailed modelling, which takes into account
these various effects, can be done, in this paper, we assumed that, at a very coarse grained level of description,
all of this amounts to causing the effective β in SEIR
models to become time dependent. If that is so, it is
interesting to see how this effective β changes in time
because of various social interventions for various populations. Keeping this motivation in mind, we presented a
procedure which can be used to reconstruct this time dependent (i.e. instantaneous) β from the time series data
of the number of confirmed cases.
We began in section §II A by reminding the reader
some fundamentals of SEIR models, particularly the
physical significance of the quantity β. In section §II B,
we described how the variables turning up in the theoretical formulation are related to the observed quantities
and illustrate it with an example. Then, in section §III,
we began by elaborating on the procedure for obtaining a
raw form of β by reconstructing from the time series data
by making use of SEIR evolution equations. It turns out
that this raw form of β can occasionally take unphysical negative values. We have explained what causes this
to happen. Furthermore, the reconstruction procedure
depends on the values of other parameters such as recovery rate (denote by γ) and incubation rate (denoted by
σ) whose experimentally known values have experimental uncertainties. Since this will lead to uncertainties in
the determination of raw β, we found out how much this
uncertainty in raw β is.
Next, in section §III B, we presented methods by which
one can obtain smoothed form of β free from spurious
fluctuations and unphysical negative values. A smoothed
β can be described by a very few numbers, these few numbers carry information about the entire history of mitigation measures during the spread of the pandemic. Since
for every country with known mitigation measures, these
handful of numbers can be determined, we can find which
mitigation measures lead to which behaviour of β. We
then illustrated how smoothed β could be used to evolve
SEIR equations. This can be used to find the evolution of
the number of infected individuals if the mitigation measures are known beforehand. Finally, we provided the
raw β for six countries to demonstrate the method. Since
many of the entries in raw βn turn out to be negative,
one needs to apply smoothening procedures to obtain a
physically acceptable β(t) from raw βn .
In summary, we have presented a method which can
be used to extract a raw instantaneous effective contact
rate for every population which undertakes mitigation
measures. We described procedures for post-processing
this raw contact rate to obtain a more physically acceptable instantaneous effective contact rate. This processed
contact rate can be described by a few parameters. In future, one could find this instantaneous processed contact

dates for different countries (see Table I for details). The vertical dashed line corresponds to tl , the time at which lockdown
is implemented. The dramatic change in the behaviour of effective β after lockdown is quite apparent for all countries except
India for which, the number of tests per million is lowest (among the countries considered here), see table I.

help us better understand to what extent a given mitigation measure affects the spread of the epidemic.
