growing demand for the management of information spread
using Artificial Intelligence. Hence, we have exploited the potential of Natural Language Processing for identifying relevant information that needs to be disseminated amongst the
masses. In this work, we present a novel Cross-lingual Natural Language Processing framework to provide relevant information by matching daily news with trusted guidelines from
the World Health Organization. The proposed pipeline deploys various techniques of NLP such as summarizers, word
embeddings, and similarity metrics to provide users with
news articles along with a corresponding healthcare guideline. A total of 36 models were evaluated and a combination
of LexRank based summarizer on Word2Vec embedding with
Word Mover distance metric outperformed all other models.
This novel open-source approach can be used as a template
for proactive dissemination of relevant healthcare information in the midst of misinformation spread associated with
epidemics.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the (SARSCov2) assumed pandemic proportions in March (Stoye
2020). Since the outbreak of COVID-19, a massive amount
of misinformation spread has taken place at an unprecedented rate through various social media platforms and other
outlets (Vaezi and Javanmard 2020). This infodemic has
created further difficulties in identifying the right solutions
as rapidly spreading false information hampers an effective
public health response. This is all the more important in
lower literacy settings, where guidelines in the local language may be unavailable. This work aims to bridge this gap
of providing the right information, to the right people, at the
right time in the right format.
While several COVID-19 data resources of text were made
public to users for building models, these have not been
used effectively to mitigate widespread irrelevant information. This article demonstrates the feasibility of an NLP approach in mitigating the prevailing infodemic. A pipeline
#

contributed equally

• News articles and WHO guidelines related to COVID-19
are collected.
• These were pre-processed to remove the unwanted characters.
• These pairs were then summarized using different summarizers.
• The embeddings of the summarized News articles and
WHO guidelines were calculated.
• The similarity between these pairs was calculated as the
distance between the summarized embeddings.
Using the proposed pipeline, multiple embeddings, summarization techniques, and distance metrics are effectively
used as a tool to mitigate infodemic by supplementing user’s
daily news consumption. This is done by providing relevant
and vetted content to users from sources such as WHO along
with the news. This work is first of its kind, incorporating
NLP techniques in order to address the issue of widespread
irrelevant information accompanying the pandemic and sets
the baseline for all future works. This open-source pipeline
can act as a template for addressing the misinformation fight
which is inevitable in such scenarios.

Methods
In this section the dataset used and the techniques deployed
in the pipeline have been described.

Dataset
The news articles dataset was scrapped from a vernacular
Hindi News Portal’s (Dainik Jagran) online publication. Articles presented to the annotators were in English which
were translated from Hindi using Google Translate API.
WHO guidelines related to COVID-19 was scrapped manually from the WHO website. WHO COVID-19 guidelines
and News Articles were collected starting from February
2020 to May 2020. These news articles were filtered to

Relevant
News Article: Are Newspapers Safe Amid Coronavirus:
Along with the coronavirus, rumors and myths related
to it are spreading fast. Which in itself is very dangerous
and is causing panic and fear in people. A similar myth
is also associated with newspapers, claiming that the last
can also be carriers of the coronavirus. However, according
to WHO information, it is safe for anyone to receive and
read the newspaper. It is safe to obtain any package from
any area where COVID-19 infections have been detected.
Answering questions related to the coronavirus, the WHO
said, An infected person is less likely to contaminate
commercial goods and there is less risk of infecting the
the virus with a packet, which rotates, is placed, and
exposed to various conditions and temperatures.
WHO Guideline: It is not certain how long the virus that
causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces,but it seems to
behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that
coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the
COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours
or up to several days. This may vary under different
conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature, or humidity
of the environment). If you think a surface may be infected,
clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect
yourself and others. Clean your hands with an
alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.

remove all the non-COVID articles. The distillation was
done using the following keywords ‘COVID’, ‘COVID-19’,
‘Corona’, ‘Coronavirus’, ‘Lockdown’, and ‘Pandemic’. A
set of thousand random pairs were generated between news
articles and the WHO guidelines. 8 annotators were assigned
to annotate all 1000 pairs answering one simple question.
The annotators were educated based on certain sample pairs
of matching which were done among highly knowledgeable
fellow researchers. Guidelines for matching the pairs were
issued to the annotators for a clear perspective. The annotators were asked to determine whether the given set of pairs
for news articles and WHO bulletins belong to a relevant or
irrelevant class. Each annotator individually annotated each
pair, thus there was no inter-user dependency and each rating
was solely a single user’s perspective.
In order to clarify the scope of each class, possible cases
that apply to the particular class were provided to the annotators. For instance, if the pair of WHO guidelines and news
articles are contextually related, then the pair would be labeled as a relevant class. Similarly, it would be labeled as an
irrelevant class if the context of the news article and WHO
guidelines were not the same. For a better understanding of
the guidelines and context for relevant and irrelevant classes,
these classes were predefined with a set of examples.
Relevant: A matching between a news article and WHO
guideline is defined as relevant if a particular user finds the
WHO guideline accompanying the news article to be related

to one another. An example where all the annotators have
labeled the pair of samples as relevant is given in Table 1.
Irrelevant: If the user finds that the WHO guideline and
the corresponding news article are unrelated, the matching
is termed irrelevant. An example annotated as irrelevant by
all annotators is given in Table 1.
The evaluation of annotations was done using the Fleiss’
Kappa metric. The Fleiss’ Kappa metric determines the level
of agreement between multiple annotators and in this case,
the value turned out to be 0.235, implying a fair agreement
among the annotators. The scale of Kappa value with interpretation have also been provided to understand the agreement among the annotators ( < 0 - No agreement, 0 —
0.20 Slight, 0.21 — 0.40 Fair, 0.41 — 0.60 Moderate, 0.61
— 0.80 Substantial, 0.81–1.0 Perfect ). The annotated pairs
were later assigned binary labels 0 or 1 (irrelevant and relevant respectively) based on the majority voting for that particular pair done by the annotators. The pairs with more than

5 votes for the relevant class were labeled as 1 whereas the
pairs with more than 5 votes for the irrelevant class were labeled with 0. In the case of a tie with four votes for relevant
and irrelevant respectively, those samples were randomly
distributed equally among both the classes so that there is
no imbalance between two classes.
The new data generated after annotation contained three
columns, first contained the news article, the second column
contained the WHO guidelines and the third column contained the binary labels determining the relevant and irrelevant class. The data was split into test and train sets with a
ratio of 80:20 for modeling purposes as shown in table 2.

Proposed Workflow
After collection of the dataset and annotation from the annotators, pre-processing of both the news articles and the WHO
guidelines was done to remove all unwanted characters. The
processed data was fed into summarizers as input for generating the summaries of the news article and the WHO guidelines. The word embeddings of words in the generated summaries were calculated using Glove and Word2Vec (Pennington, Socher, and Manning 2014; Mikolov et al. 2013).
From the generated word embeddings, the weighted mean of
all embedded word vectors was found using Smooth Inverse
Frequency to obtain a single embedded vector representing
the entire news article and WHO guidelines (Arora, Liang,
and Ma 2016). Distance metrics were used to find the similarity between the two generated article vectors (i.e between
embedded vectors of the news article and WHO guidelines).
The similarity score between all pairs in the training set
was used to calculate the Youden’s Index for each model
to obtain the optimal similarity threshold, where pairs with
similarity above the threshold are considered relevant and
vice-versa (Youden 1950). The optimal similarity threshold
represents the similarity score at which the difference between the number of pairs correctly classified as relevant and
the number of pairs incorrectly classified as relevant is maximized. This effectively serves the purpose of providing only
relevant information to the end-user while simultaneously
minimizing the delivery of irrelevant information. Further,
the optimal threshold obtained for the particular model on
the training set was used to evaluate the Youden’s metric on
the test set. The similarity scores were calculated for each
model on the test pairs and pairs with similarity greater than
the optimum threshold for the particular model comprised
of the relevant class and pairs with similarity score below
the threshold formed the irrelevant class. The original WHO
guidelines and News articles were provided to the users corresponding to the relevant class. The detailed description of
all the models and methodologies has been explained in the
subsections below.
Preprocessing Preprocessing is a method in which text
is transformed into a machine-readable format. The preprocessing pipeline in our framework includes punctuation removal, conversion of input text to lowercase, tokenization,
stop word removal, and stemming algorithm. Tokenization
has been done using the NLTK tokenizer. For stemming, we
have used Porter stemming which seemed to be appropriate

for our use case on the basis of qualitative analysis of different stemming algorithms.
Summarization The effectiveness of numerous extractive
summarization techniques has been explored in this framework to generate summaries from various lengths of news
articles and WHO guidelines. This technique was used for
reducing the size of the articles and guidelines while preserving the main context. These techniques prevent the
introduction of errors, hence extracting meaningful sentences. This helped in removing unnecessary sections of text
thereby making the framework efficient. The summarization of articles and guidelines thus enhanced the speed of
the framework because the succeeding step was to generate word embeddings. The summaries of news articles and
WHO guidelines contained only the important sentences and
the calculation of word embeddings was done only for the
words in these sentences. The following extractive text summarization techniques were used to elicit the most important
sentences from these articles and guidelines.
Graph-Based - For summarization of the news articles
along with WHO guidelines, the following Graph-Based
summarization techniques were used: LexRank, Reduction,
PyTextRank, and TextRank with Gensim (Erkan and Radev
2004; Jing 2000; Nathan 2016; Barrios et al. 2016). All these
techniques are slight variations of the primitive PageRank
Algorithm. TextRank uses the typical PageRank approach
while LexRank additionally uses cosine similarity of TFIDF vectors simultaneously accounting for the position and
length of sentences(Mihalcea and Tarau 2004). In these algorithms, concatenated text from the articles was split into
individual sentences and embedded into vectors. The similarity score was calculated for these sentence vectors to generate a similarity matrix. The similarity matrix was then converted into a graph-based structure for sentence rank calculation, with similarity scores as the edges and sentences as
the vertices of the matrix. Finally, a certain number of topranked sentences formed the final summary of the news articles and WHO guidelines.
Topic-Based - Latent Semantic Analysis(LSA) Summarizer is a topic-based summarization technique (Ozsoy, Alpaslan, and Cicekli 2011). This approach used a Bag-ofwords to create a term-document matrix for the news articles and WHO guidelines where rows represented the terms
present in the articles and columns represented the sentences
within the articles(which contained the terms). The termdocument matrix is represented by X where elements (i,j)
represent the occurrence of term i in article j.
The rows of the matrix represented vectors corresponding
to a term and its relation with different sentences present in
the article. The columns represented vectors corresponding
to sentences and their relation with different terms present
in the corpus of the individual article. A decomposition of
X was done such that U and V are orthogonal matrices.
This decomposition of X is called singular value decomposition(SVD). The term-document matrix was decomposed
into U and V, where U and V are orthogonal matrices of X.
X = U ΣV T

Figure 1: Proposed Framework. The pipeline takes news articles and WHO guidelines as input. These are then preprocessed,
summarized, converted to embeddings and finally, the distance between the generated embeddings is delivered as the similarity
score. Various combinations of summarization techniques, embedding, and distance metrics were used.
P

is the matrix of singular values and ui and vi
are left and right singular vectors. Matrix V T denotes the
strength of each word in a sentence. Hence, it effectively extracted hidden semantic structures of words and sentences
present in the articles. The important sentences for summaries were extracted using this Singular Value Decomposition(SVD).
Feature-Based - The feature-based method of summarization used was Luhn’s method (Luhn 1958). One of the
oldest approaches, Luhn summarization began with a frequency analysis of the words in the articles. This was followed by the calculation of the weight of the sentence based
on the window size of fewer frequency words between highfrequency words. The sentences with the highest weights
were given as the summary for the news articles and WHO
guidelines.
Vocabulary Minimization - KL divergence based summarization is effectively a vocabulary minimization technique
(Sripada and Jagarlamudi 2009). This method is based on
minimizing the divergence of summarized vocabulary and
input vocabulary, giving low KL divergence of a good summary and input document. It works by greedily adding sentences to a summary as long as it decreases the KL Divergence thus focusing on the minimization of summary vocabulary by checking the divergence from the input vocabulary.
In our case, P was the original article distribution and Q was
the summarized document distribution. The distribution of
the summarized document was matched with the distribu-

tion of the original text, thereby minimizing the difference
using the KL divergence technique.

Embedding Embedding is a method in which the words
from the textual data are converted into numeric vectors that
can be processed by the machines for modeling. Embeddings are extremely useful in reducing the dimensionality of
the textual data. The technique used for calculating articlelevel word embedding is stated as follows.
• The word embeddings were calculated from the summary
of the news articles and WHO guidelines using Word2vec
or Glove.
• The weighted average of these word embeddings was calculated using Smooth Inverse Frequency.
• This weighted average was considered as the embedding
for the summarised article.
The following models were used for the validation of the
architecture.
Word2Vec - A neural network with two layers that takes
text corpus as input and vectorizes it (Mikolov et al. 2013).
It uses two methods for calculating the word representation, CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words) and Skip-Gram.
The Word2Vec model was used for finding the embedding
vector of words present within the article corpus. The skip

gram algorithm randomly initializes vectors for these words
in the corpus. The algorithm then iterates through the set of
all words T and defines a centre word c at the position t and
its context word is defined as o. The window size defined for
context words is m, which means the model will consider a
window of t+m and t-m for searching the context words.
The model then tries to maximize the likelihood L(θ) of the
context words given the center word, i.e. the probability of
model predicting the context words given the center word.
The likelihood function L(θ) is represented by :
L(θ) =

T
Y

P (wt+j |wt ; θ)

J=

For maximizing the likelihood function, the derivative of
the function J(θ) was taken after taking a log of the likelihood equation and multiplying it by -1 for calculating the
-ve log-likelihood.

logP (wt+j |wt ; θ)

−m≤j≤m

The words were represented by two sets of vectors, Uw
and Vw . Uw is the vector of the context word and Vw is for
center word. These two vectors were used for calculating
the probability P of the center word o given context word c
which is given as,
exp(uTo vc )
T
wV ocab exp(uw vc )

P (O = o|C = c) = P

(5)

The loss function was minimized using the gradient descent algorithm to update the weights of the word vectors.
This would lead to the vector representation of words, and
similar words with the same context will point in the same
direction. The key advantage of Word2Vec is that highquality word embeddings can be learned in an efficient space
and time which further allows the large embeddings with
more dimensions to be learned using a larger corpus of
texts. The pre-trained word vectors for the Word2Vec model
were loaded from the gensim library. The version of the pretrained embedding used for experimentation is the publicly
available Word2Vec model pre-trained on Google News corpus (3 million 300-dimension English word vectors).
Glove - It is one of the word embedding models which
works on the statistical theory that predicts the behavior of
the words based on their co-occurrence probabilities (Pennington, Socher, and Manning 2014). This helps in incorporating meaningful vectors to the words present within the
vocabulary. The probability Pij calculates the occurrence of
word j in the context of a word i within the corpus.
Pij = P (j|i) = P

The Glove model then builds an objective function that
determines the relation between word vectors and text statistics. The final Glove function J is

where X is word-word co-occurrence matrix and Xi j denotes the count of the word j appearing in the context of

The function F built by the Glove model will predict ratios
given two word vectors wi and wj and a context word vector
wk as inputs.

The algorithm effectively minimizes this function to learn
meaningful vector representations. The version of Glove
used for experimentation is the publicly available common
Crawl (840B tokens, 2.2M vocab, cased, 300 dimension vectors).

Distance Metrics
The similarity score between the embeddings of news articles and the WHO guidelines was found using Cosine
Similarity and Word Mover Distance(WMD) (Lahitani, Permanasari, and Setiawan 2016; Kusner et al. 2015).
Cosine Similarity - It is used for calculating the similarity between two documents(WHO Guideline and News
Article) by measuring the cosine angle formed by the two
vectors. The mean weighted vectors for each guideline and
news articles have been obtained using smooth inverse frequency. Cosine distance is not dependent upon the size of
documents. Hence the cosine similarity of embedding vectors for News article and WHO guidelines will be close to 1
if they are similar to each other, while it will be -1 if they are
completely dissimilar.
Word Mover Distance(WMD) - It is used for finding
the Euclidean distance of weighted embedded vectors. The
Word Mover distance for the news article and WHO guidelines were calculated to find a similarity score between them.
Word Mover Distance helps compare the two documents
even when there is no word in common. The algorithm uses
bag-of-words representation (which puts the word frequencies in the documents) finding the minimum traveling distance between articles and guidelines in an efficient way.

Results
Evaluation Metrics
The objective of the proposed pipeline is two-fold - maximizing relevant content delivery and simultaneously minimizing the delivery of irrelevant content to the end-user. To
facilitate this, the metrics considered throughout the experimentation are True Positive Rate, False Positive Rate, and
Youden’s Index (Youden 1950).
True-Positive rate (TPR) also referred to as Sensitivity,
measures the proportion of actual relevant pairs that are correctly classified as relevant.

Experimental Results
Multiple combinations of models have been deployed in the
proposed framework. All possible combinations with a set

of word embedding models (Glove and Word2Vec), summarization techniques (Summa, Gensim, Pyrank, LexRank,
LSA, Luhn, KL Divergence, Reduction, and No summarizer), and distance metrics (Cosine and Word Mover Distance) have been evaluated. A combination of 36 models was
generated for each possible configuration. Given the labeled
dataset of Relevant and Irrelevant pairs, we deploy our models on all pairs and the evaluation is done in the following
manner.
Youden’s Index based thresholding was used to find the
optimum cut-off point for each of these 36 models on the
training data. These models were trained on 799 news articles and WHO guidelines pair as mentioned in table 2. The
corresponding ROC curves were plotted for each similarity score and the optimum threshold for each is obtained
based on the Youden’s index on the training data. The optimal threshold represents the similarity score which maximizes the difference between the TPR and FPR. It effectively implies the maximization of the number of relevant
articles while minimizing the irrelevant articles delivered to
the users. The values of similarity scores used to plot the
ROC for each model was bound between the maximum and
minimum similarity scores for the particular model.
The ROC curves obtained on the training data for the topperforming models are shown in Fig. 2. Using the optimum
threshold, the top 10 models with the highest Youden’s index were evaluated on the test set. All pairs with a similarity score above the optimum threshold were classified
as relevant and ones with scores below the threshold were
classified as irrelevant. The results obtained on the test set
are shown in Table 3. The model with the best performance
on the test set used Word2Vec embedding, LexRank based
summarizer, and WMD distance metric. This model had the
highest value of Youden’s metric 0.1953, with a True Positive Rate of 0.320 and False Positive Rate of 0.125. Word
Mover Distance outperformed Cosine Distance as the distance metric as it was common in all top 10 models. All the
experimentation has been performed on Intel Core i5-7200U
CPU with 8GB RAM with no GPU support. The average run
time for each proposed model is 300 seconds making the
proposed pipeline computationally inexpensive.

Discussion
The spread of COVID-19 has been exponential where lakhs
of people have been affected by the virus. Due to the rapid
spread of the virus in India, there has been a fear of concern
related to the disease in the economically weaker section.
This has led to the spread of irrelevant information through
various social platforms.
The idea of the project was to disseminate relevant and
reliable information of news articles and WHO guidelines
to hard-to-reach groups staying in villages or suburban areas where the mode of communication is only Hindi. The
WHO guidelines relevant to the corresponding news article
will be provided to users. WHO guidelines was considered
as it contains trusted and vetted forms of information related
to the pandemic. A vernacular Hindi News Portal (Dainik
Jagran) was chosen for scraping the news articles so that it
could help in transmitting the news and relevant COVID-19

articles in regional language (Hindi) via speech translation.
On qualitative evaluation, the Google Translate API used
for conversion of Hindi to English retained more context in
the sentence than the conversion of English to Hindi. Given
that the objective was to communicate the final news articles
in Hindi, an incorrect translation from English to Hindi resulted in bad user experience. In any language conversion,
there is an information loss that majorly consists of stopwords and for our modeling the loss of stopwords was insignificant. Thus the news articles were converted into English which was further processed into the framework for
modeling.
Although WHO guidelines will be changing over time,
the relevant and irrelevant annotations for new WHO guidelines paired with news articles will subsequently be crowdsourced from the users through an optional automated feedback form after every matching. The majority label obtained
from the crowdsourced annotations will be assigned as the
class label for that particular matching. The new crowdsourced dataset will now serve as the training set to designate the threshold for the new guidelines. This humanin-loop interacting framework would ensure that our model
will be robust to changes in WHO guidelines and will constantly stay updated and relevant. The only shortcomings
that our study had were the fact that it required manual
annotation for initial training due to which the model was
trained on less number of samples. Currently, the human-inthe-loop feedback chain has been introduced for annotations
related to new guidelines which would be incorporated in the
model subsequently for training purposes. This study will
be extended for generating article-embeddings for news articles and WHO guidelines using Doc2vec (Le and Mikolov
2014). Also, various other language models will be explored
for creating the embeddings in order to understand the feature space article vectors.

Conclusion
The research conducted empirically tested the efficacy of
NLP as an infodemic management tool. Specifically, it explored various models on extractive text summarization,
word embeddings, and distance metrics. The result is an
open-source AI framework for managing the spread of irrelevant information during the time of epidemics with Natural Language Processing. Incorporating WHO guidelines
with relevant news articles based on user reviews, this learning model prove to be effective. Based on our knowledge
from the current literature survey, there exists no such work
addressing the information spectrum accompanying any
healthcare debacle. From the evaluation, it was found that
LexRank along with Word2vec and Word Distance Mover
proved to be the best model for matching WHO guidelines
with news articles related to COVID-19 in a relevant manner. Being the first of it’s kind, the proposed architecture
was evaluated based on the manually annotated data using
Youden’s index. This framework can effectively be incorporated into existing channels of information propagation.
Given the limited data available for training, the promising
results highlight the tremendous scope for such models in
addressing the glut of irrelevant information spread.
