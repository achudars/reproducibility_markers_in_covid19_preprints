Several analytical models have been used in this work to describe the evolution of death cases
arising from coronavirus (COVID-19). The Death or ‘D’ model is a simplified version of the SIR
(susceptible-infected-recovered) model, which assumes no recovery over time, and allows for the
transmission-dynamics equations to be solved analytically. The D-model can be extended to describe
various focuses of infection, which may account for the original pandemic (D1), the lockdown (D2)
and other effects (Dn). The evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries (China,
Spain, Italy, France, UK, Iran, USA and Germany) shows a similar behavior in concord with the
D-model trend, characterized by a rapid increase of death cases followed by a slow decline, which are
affected by the earliness and efficiency of the lockdown effect. These results are in agreement with
more accurate calculations using the extended SIR model with a parametrized solution and more
sophisticated Monte Carlo grid simulations, which predict similar trends and indicate a common
evolution of the pandemic with universal parameters.

MOTIVATION

The SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model is
widely used as first-order approximation to viral spreading of contagious epidemics [1], mass immunization planning [2, 3], marketing, informatics and social networks [4].
Its cornerstone is the so-called “mass-action” principle
introduced by Hamer, which assumes that the course of
an epidemic depends on the rate of contact between susceptible and infected individuals [5]. This idea was extended to a continuous time framework by Ross in his
pioneering work on malaria transmission dynamics [6–
8], and finally put into its classic mathematical form by
Kermack and McKendric [9]. The SIR model was further
developed by Kendall, who provided a spatial generalization of the Kermack and McKendrick model in a closed
population [10] (i.e. neglecting the effects of spatial migration), and Bartlett, who – after investigating the connection between the periodicity of measles epidemics and
community size – predicted a traveling wave of infection
moving out from the initial source of infection [11, 12].
More recent implementations have considered the typical
incubation period of the disease and the spatial migration
of the population.
The COVID-19 pandemic has ignited the submission of
multiple manuscripts in the last weeks. Most statistical
distributions used to estimate disease occurrence are of
the binomial, Poisson, Gaussian, Fermi or exponential

types. Despite their intrinsic differences, these distributions generally lead to similar results, assuming independence and homogeneity of disease risks [13].
In this work, we propose a simple and easy-to-use epidemiological model – the Death or D model [14] – that
can be compared with data in order to investigate the
evolution of the infection and deviations from the predicted trends. The D model is a simplified version of
the SIR model with analytical solutions under the assumption of no recovery – at least during the time of the
pandemic. We apply it globally to countries where the
infestation of the COVID-19 coronavirus has widespread
and caused thousands of deaths [15, 16].
Additionally, D-model calculations are benchmarked
with more sophisticated and reliable calculations using
the extended SIR (ESIR) and Monte Carlo Planck
(MCP) models – also developed in this work – which
provide similar results, but allow for a more coherent
spatial-time disentanglement of the various effects
present during a pandemic. A similar ESIR model has
recently been proposed by Squillante and collaborators
for infected individuals as a function of time, based on
the Ising model – which describes ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics – and a Fermi-Dirac distribution [17].
This model also reproduces a posteriori the COVID-19
data for infestations in China as well as other pandemics
such as Ebola, SARS, and influenza A/H1N1.
The SIR model considers the three possible states of
the members of a closed population affected by a contagious disease. It is, therefore, characterized by a system
of three coupled non-linear ordinary differential equations [18], which involve three time-dependent functions:

2
• Susceptible individuals, S(t), at risk of becoming
infected by the disease.
• Infected individuals, I(t).
• Recovered or removed individuals, R(t), who were
infected and may have developed an immunity system or die.
The SIR model describes well a viral disease, where
individuals typically go from the susceptible class S to
the infected class I, and finally to the removed class R.
Recovered individuals cannot go back to be susceptible or
infected classes, as it is, potentially, the case of bacterial
infection. The resulting transmission-dynamics system
for a closed population is described by

which represents the simplest mathematical form of all
disease models, where the infection rate is proportional
to both the infected, I, and susceptible individuals N −I.
Equation 5 is trivially solved by multiplying by dt and
dividing by (N − I)I,

Finally, solving this algebraic equation we obtain the solution I(t)

where λ > 0 is the transmission or spreading rate, β > 0
is the removal rate and N is the fixed population size,
which implies that the model neglects the effects of spatial migration. Currently, there is no vaccination available for COVID-19, and the only way to reduce the transmission or infection rate λ – which is often referred to as
“flattening the curve”– is by implementing strong social
distancing and hygiene measures.
The system is reduced to a first-order differential equation, which does not possess an explicit solution, but
can be solved numerically. The SIR model can then be
parametrized using actual infection data to solve I(t), in
order to investigate the evolution of the disease. In the
D model, we make the drastic assumption of no recovery in order to obtain an analytical formula to describe –
instead of infestations – the death evolution by COVID19. This can be useful as a fast method to foresee the
global behavior as a first approach, before applying more
sophisticated methods. We shall see that the resulting
D model describes well enough the data of the current
pandemics in different countries.

THE DEATH OR D MODEL

The main assumption of the D model is the absence of
recovery from coronavirus, i.e. R(t) = 0, at least during
the pandemic time interval. This assumption may be
reasonable if the spreading time of the pandemic is much
faster than the recovery time, i.e. λ ≫ β. The SIR
equations are then reduced to the single equation of the
well-known SI model,
dI
= λ(N − I(t))I(t),
dt

(5)

where I0 = I(t0 ). Taking the exponential on both sides

I(t) =

N I0 eλN (t−t0 )
,
N − I0 + I0 eλN (t−t0 )

(9)

(10)

which can be written in the form
I(t) =

I0 e(t−t0 )/b

1 − C + C e(t−t0 )/b

(11)

where we have defined the constants
b=

C=

(12)

The parameter b is the characteristic evolution time of
the initial exponential increase of the pandemic. The
constant C is the initial infestation rate with respect to
the total population N . Assuming C ≪ 1, Eq. 11 yields
I(t) =

I0 e(t−t0 )/b
.
1 + C e(t−t0 )/b

(13)

In order to predict the number of deaths in the D model
we assume that the number of deaths at some time t is
proportional to the infestation at some former time τ ,
that is,
D(t) = µI(t − τ ),

(14)

where µ is the death rate, and τ is the death time. With
this assumption we can finally write the D-model equation as
D(t) =

ae(t−t0 )/b
,
1 + c e(t−t0 )/b

(15)

where a = µI0 e−τ /b , c = C e−τ /b , and a/c yields the
total number of deaths predicted by the model. This is

of our predictions, Fig. II shows the evolution of a, b, and

the final equation for the D-model, which presents a similar shape to the well-known Woods-Saxon potential for
the nucleons inside the atomic nucleus or the bacterial
growth curve. The rest of the parameters, µ, τ , I0 and
N are embedded in the parameters a, b, c, which represent space-time averages and can be fitted to the timely
available data.
In Fig. 1, we present the fit of the D-model to the
COVID-19 death data for China, where its evolution
has apparently been controlled and the D function has
reached the plateau zone, with few increments over time,
or fluctuations that are beyond the model assumptions.
This plot shows the duration of the pandemic – about
two months to reach the top end of the curve – and the
agreement, despite the crude assumptions, between data
and the evolution trend described by the D-model. This
agreement encourages the application of the D model
to other countries in order to investigate the different
trends.

• The parameter a is the theoretical number of
deaths at the day corresponding to t = 0. In general, it differs from the experimental value and can
be interpreted as the expected value of deaths that
day. Note that experimental data may be subject
to unknown systematic errors and different counting methods.

• The times T95 and T99 correspond to D =
0.95D(∞) and D = 0.99D(∞), respectively. These
times are obtained by solving the equation D(t) =
γa/c, where γ = 0.95 or 0.99. The solution of that
equation is

Figure II shows the stable trend of the parameters between days 19 to 24 (corresponding to March 27–30),
right before reaching the peak of deaths cases, which occurred in Spain around April 1. Such stability validates
the D-model predictions during this time. However, a
rapid change of the parameters is observed, especially
for a, once the peak is reached, drastically changing the
prediction of the number of deaths given by a/c. This
sudden change results in the slowing down of deaths per
day and longer time predictions T95 and T99 .
The parameters of the D model correspond to average
values over time of the interaction coefficients between
individuals, i.e. they are sensitive to an additional external effect on the pandemic evolution. These may include
the lockdown effect imposed in Spain in March 14 and
other effects such as new sources of infection or a sudden increase of the total susceptible individuals due to
social migration and large mass gatherings [20]. It is not
possible to identify a specific cause because its effects
are blurred by the stochastic evolution of the pandemic,
which is why any reliable forecast presents large errors.

FIG. 3: Predictions of the D model for D′ (t) in Spain according with the data collected up to April 5.

Using the D model fitted to cumulative deaths allows
to compute deaths/day as
D(t) − D(t − ∆t) ≃ D′ (t)∆t,

(19)

where ∆t = 1 day. Figure 3 shows that Eqs. 18 and 19
yield similar parameters, as the time increment is small
enough compared with the time evolution of the D(t)
function. Hence, the first derivative D′ (t) can be used
to describe deaths per day. In addition, Fig. 4 shows
that the parameters may be different for both D and D′
functions using cumulative and daily deaths, respectively,
as shown for Spain on April 5. It is also important to
note that b is directly proportional to the full width at
half maximum (F W HM ) of the D′ (t) distribution,
√
(20)
F W HM = 2b ℓn(3 + 2 2) ≈ 3.5 b.
As shown below, the b parameter presents typical values between 4 and 10 for most countries undergoing the
initial exponential phase, which yields a minimum and
maximum time of 14 and 35 days, respectively, between
the two extreme values of the F W HM .

The D′ model

One can also determine deaths/day rates by applying
the first derivative to Eq. 15,

– which normally gives a slightly different set of parameters when compared with the D model.

Dn model with two or more channels of infection

Some models [21] include changes in the transmission
rate due to various interventions implemented to contain
the outbreak. The simple D model does not allow to do
this explicitly, but changes in the spread can be taken
into account by considering the total D or Dn function
as the sum of two or more independent D-functions with
different parameters, which may reveal the existence of
several independent sources, or virus channels. An example is shown in Fig. 5, where the two-channel function

peak, which substantially increase the number of deaths

Additionally, the cumulative D-function can also be
computed with a two-channel function,
D2 = D(a, b, c) + D(a2 , b2 , c2 ),

Estimation of the infected function I(t)

The D-model can also be used to estimate I(t) using
the initial values of I0 = I(0) and the total number of
susceptible people N = S(0). The initial value of N is
unknown, and not necessarily equal to the population of
the whole country since the pandemic started in localized areas. Here, we shall assume N = 106 , although
plausible values of N can be tens of millions. Note that
the no-recovery assumption of the D model is unrealistic,
and this calculation only provides an estimation of the
number of individuals that were infected at some time,
independently of whether they recovered or not.
From the definition of D(t) in Eq. 14, the following
relations between the several parameters of the model
were extracted

which provides, as shown in Fig. 6, a more accurate
prediction for the total number of deaths and clearly illustrates the separate effect of both source peaks. It is
interesting to note that for large t, a ≈ a2 , c ≈ c2 and
b2 ≈ 2b. In such a case, the total number of deaths expected during the pandemic is given by D2 (∞) = 2a/c.

Hence, µ can be computed by knowing N . However, to
obtain I0 one needs to know the death time τ . This has
been estimated to be about 15 to 20 days for COVID-19
cases, which can be used to compute two estimates of
I(t). These are given in Fig. 7 for the case of Spain.
Since there is no recovery in the D model, the total
number of infected people is I ∼ N for large t, i.e. N =
106 in our case. In Fig. 7, we have labeled the beginning
of the lockdown in Spain (March 15). For τ = 15 days,
most of the susceptible individuals were already infected
on that date, and even more for τ = 20 days, as the

These results depend on the total susceptible population N . However, the ratio of infected with respect to
susceptibles, I/N , is independent on N . This function
depends only on τ and is shown in the bottom panel of
Fig. 8 for τ = 15 and 20 days, which reveals the rapid
spread of the pandemic. Accordingly, between 10% and
30% of the susceptibles were infected in March 7, and one
month later (April 6), when the fit was made, all susceptibles had been infected. This does not means that the full
population of the country got infected, since the number
N is unknown and, for instance, excludes individuals in
isolated regions, and it may additionally change because
of spatial migration, not considered in the model.

FIG. 9: Fit of the ESIR model to daily deaths in Spain up to April 15 using no boundary condition for the final number of
deaths (left panel), and with boundary conditions of D′ (100) = 10 (middle panel) and D′ (100) = 5 (right panel) deaths/day.

R(0) = 0. Moreover, if we normalize the functions S, I
and R to 1,
S = sN,
I = iN,
R = rN,

(35)

(37)

so that s + i + r = 1, then r(t) verifies



(38)

which can be solved numerically, or by approximate
methods in some cases. In Ref. [9], a solution was found
for small values of the exponent λN r/β. For the coronavirus pandemic, however, this number is expected to
increase and be close to one at the pandemic end.
At this point, we propose a modification of the standard SIR model. Instead of solving Eq. 38 numerically
and fitting the parameters to data, the solution can be
parametrized as
r(t) =

a
,
c + e−t/b

(39)

which presents the same functional form as the D-model
and, conveniently, provides a faster way to fit the model
parameters by avoiding the numerical problem of solving
Eq. 38. In fact, numerical solutions of the SIR model
present a similar step function for R(t). Additionally,
one can assume that D(t) is proportional to R(t), and
can also be written as


dD
(40)
= a2 1 − c2 e−r/b2 − r(t) ,
dt
where a2 , c2 = s0 and b2 = β/(λN ) are unknown parameters to be fitted to deaths-per-day data, together with
the three parameters of the r(t)-function: a, b, c.
Figure 9 shows fits of the ESIR model to daily deaths
in Spain during the coronavirus spread. The use of no

boundary condition for the number of deaths (left panel)
is not an exact solution of the SIR differential equation.
A way to solve this problem is to impose the condition
D′ (∞) = 0, as the number of deaths must stop at some
time. Numerically, it is enough to choose a small value
of D′ (t) for an arbitrary large t. The middle and right
panels of Fig. 9 show different boundary conditions of
D′ (100) = 10 and D′ (100) = 5, respectively, which yield
the same results and the expected behavior for a viral
disease spreading and declining.
It is also consistently observed (e.g. see middle and
right panels of Fig. 9), that at large t, r(t) → ac ≈ 1,
which essentially means that most of the susceptible population N recovers, as we previously inferred from the D
model. This, together with the fact that c2 can always
be adjusted to 1, leaves the ESIR model with essentially
4 free parameters to fit to the daily death data; i.e. the
same number of parameters than the original SIR model.
As shown in Fig. 10, ESIR fits reproduce well the long
flattening behavior observed in UK, USA, Germany or
Iran, whereas it fails to reproduce the more-pronounced
double-peak structure typically observed in countries like
France, Italy, Spain or Belgium.
As previously done with the D model, one can also
expand the ESIR model to accommodate this apparent
failure to take lockdown effects into account. Similarly,
the ESIR2 model is proposed as,


ESIR2(t) = a2 1 − c2 e−r/b2 − r(t) ,

left with five free parameters.

and France (right).

Finally, Fig. 11 shows the comparison between the
ESIR2 and D2′ fits to real data for countries where
COVID-19 has widely spread: Belgium, USA, France,
Germany, Iran, Italy, Spain and UK, USA. Death data
are taken from Refs. [19, 22, 23] and consider 7-day average smoothing to correct for anomalies in data collection
such as the typical weekend staggering observed in various countries, where weekend data are counted at the
beginning of the next week. Real error intervals are extracted from the correlation matrix. As discussed in Section 2.3, the reduced D2′ model has been used with a = a2
and c = c2 . Although arising from different assumptions,
both models provide similar data descriptions and predictions, with slightly better values of χ2 per degree of
freedom for the ESIR2 model. It is also interesting to
note that the reduced ESIR2 model with five parameters
yields similar results to the full ESIR2 model, with eight
parameters.
As data become available, daily predictions vary for
both ESIR2 and the D2′ models. This is because the
model parameters are actually statistical averages over
space-time of the properties of the complex system. No
model is able to predict changes over time of these properties if the physical causes of these changes are not included. The values of the model parameters are only well
defined when the disease spread is coming to an end and
time changes in the parameters have little influence.

IV.

DISCUSSION OF GLOBAL RESULTS

More sophisticated calculations can be compared with
ESIR2 and D2′ predictions. In particular, Monte Carlo
(MC) simulations have also been performed in this work
for the Spanish case [24], which consist of a lattice of cells
that can be in four different states: susceptible, infected,
recovered or death. An infected cell can transmit the
disease to any other susceptible cell within some random
range R. The transmission mechanism follows principles
of nuclear physics for the interaction of a particle with

a target. Each infected particle interacts a number n
of times over the interaction region, according to its energy. The number of interactions is proportional to the
interaction cross section σ and to the target surface density ρ. The discrete energy follows a Planck distribution
law depending on the ’temperature’ of the system. For
any interaction, an infection probability is applied. Finally, time-dependent recovery and death probabilities
are also applied. The resulting virus spread for different
sets of parameters can be adjusted from COVID-19 pandemic data. In addition, parameters can be made time
dependent in order to investigate, for instance, the effect
of an early lockdown or large mass gatherings at the rise
of the pandemic.
As shown in Fig. 12, our MC simulations present similar results to the D2′ model, which validates the use of
the simple D-model as a first-order approximation. More
details on the MC simulation will be presented in a separate manuscript [24]. Interestingly, MC simulations follow the data trend up to May 11 without any changes in
the parameters for nearly two weeks. An app for Android
devices, where the Monte Carlo Planck model has been
implemented to visualize the simulation is available from
Ref. [25].
In order to investigate the universality of the pandemic, it is interesting to compare all countries by plotting the D model in terms of the variable (t − t0 )/b,
where t0 is the maximum of the daily curve given by
tmax = −b ℓn(c). By shifting Eq. 15 by tmax = −b ℓn(c)
and dividing by tmax = a/c, the normalized D function
is given by,
Dnorm (t) =

c e(t−tmax )/b
.
1 + c e(t−tmax )/b

(43)

The left of Fig. 13 shows similar trends for the normalized D curves of different countries, which suggests a
universal behavior of the COVID-19 pandemic. Only Iran
seems to slightly deviate from the global trend, which
may indicate an early and more effective initial lockdown.
A similar approach can be done for the daily data using

the D′ and ESIR2 models, as shown in the middle and
right panels of Fig. 13, respectively. Although different
countries show similar trends, statistical fluctuations in
the daily data do not result in a nice universal behavior

as compared with Dnorm . However, the D′ and ESIR2
plots show that an effective lockdown is characterized by
flatter and broader peaks, best characterized the Iranian
case, whereas Spain and Germany present the sharper

FINAL REMARKS

The global models considered in this work present some
differences with respect to other existing models. First,
in this work we have tried to keep the models as simple
as possible. This allows to use theoretical-inspired analytical expressions or semi-empirical formulae to perform
the data analysis. The use of semi-empirical expressions
for describing physical phenomena is recurrent in physics.
One of the most famous is the semi-empirical mass formula from nuclear physics. Of course the free parameters
need to be fitted from known data, but this allowed to
obtain predictions for unknown elements.
In our case we were inspired by the well known statistical SIR-kind models slightly modified to obtain analytical expressions that carry the leading time dependence. We have found that the D and D2 models allow
a fast and efficient analysis of the pandemics in the initial and advanced stages. Our results show that the time
dependence of the pandemic parameters due to the lockdown can be effectively simulated by the sum of two Dfunctions with different widths and heights and centered
at different times. The distance between the maxima
of the two D-functions should be a measure of the time
between the effective pandemic beginning and lockdown.
In the Spanish case this is about 20 days. Taking into
account that lockdown started in March 14, this marks
the pandemic starting time as about February 22. Had
the lockdown started on that date, the deaths would had
been highly reduced. The smooth blending between the
two peaks provides a transition between the two statistical regimes (or physical phases) with and without lockdown.
The Monte Carlo simulation results are in agreement
with our previous analysis with the D and D2 models.
The Monte Carlo generates events in a population of in-

dividuals in a lattice or grid of cells. We simulate the
movement of individuals outside of the cells and interactions with the susceptible individuals within a finite
range. The randon events follow statistical distributions
based on the exponential laws of statistical mechanics
for a system of interacting particles, driven by macroscopic magnitudes as the temperature, and interaction
probabilities between individuals, that can be related to
interaction cross sections.
The Monte Carlo simulation spread the virus in spacetime, and allows also space-time dependence on the parameters. In this work we have made the simplest assumptions, only allowing for a lockdown effect by reducing the range of the interaction starting on a fixed day.
This simple modification allowed to reproduce nicely the
Spanish death-per-day curve. The lockdown produces
a relatively long broadening of the curve and a slow decay. Similar MC calculations can be performed in several
countries to infer the devastating effect of a late lockdown
as compared with early lockdown measures. The later is
the case of South Africa and other countries, which have
not reached the exponential growth.
The Death and extended SIR models are simple enough
to provide fast estimations of pandemic evolution by fitting spatial-time average parameters, and present a good
first-order approximation to understand secondary effects
during the pandemic, such as lockdown and population
migrations, which may help to control the disease. Similar models are available [17, 26], but challenges in epidemiological modeling remain [27–30]. This is a very
complex system, which involves many degrees of freedom
and millions of people, and even assuming consistent disease reporting - which is rarely the case – there remains
an important open question: Can any model predict the
evolution of an epidemic from partial data? Or similarly,
Is it possible, at any given time and data, to measure the
validity of an epidemic growth curve? We finally hope
that we have added new insightful ideas with the Death,
the extended SIR and Monte Carlo models, which can

now be applied to any country which has followed the
initial exponential pandemic growth.
