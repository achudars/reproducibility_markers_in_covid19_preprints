We demonstrate that the epidemic renormalisation group approach to pandemics provides an
effective and simple way to investigate the dynamics of disease transmission and spreading across
different regions of the world. The framework also allows for reliable projections on the impact of
travel limitations and social distancing measures on global epidemic spread. We test and calibrate
it on reported cases while unveiling the mechanism that governs the delay in the relative peaks
of newly infected cases among different regions of the globe. We discover that social distancing
measures are more effective than travel limitations across borders in delaying the epidemic peak.
We further provide the link to compartmental models such as the simplistic and time-honoured
SIR-like models. We also show how to generalise the framework to account for the interactions
across several regions of the world, replacing or complementing large scale simulations.

I.

INTRODUCING THE FRAMEWORK

The COVID-19 pandemic is raging around the world
with an immense toll in terms of human, economic and
social impact. Forecasting a pandemic dynamics and its
spreading is therefore paramount in helping governments
to make informed decisions on a number of social and economic measures, apt at curbing the pandemic and dealing
with its aftermath.
While different empirical models already exist to describe the epidemic dynamics locally and globally, a coherent framework is missing. Using a powerful language
and methodology borrowed from high energy physics, we
study and forecast the spreading dynamics and containment across different regions of the world. This framework is the renormalisation group approach [1, 2], which
was successfully employed for epidemic dynamics in [3].
Here we will generalise the framework to take into account the dynamics in between different regions of the
world. The approach is complementary to other methods
summarised in [4–8]. As for the widely adopted choice
to represent the data by fitting them to simple minded
logistic functions we refer to [9–14]. We will also provide a map between our framework and compartmental
models such as the time-honoured SIR model [15]. Our
epidemic renormalisation group (eRG) approach is based

upon a simpler set of equations, which can be extended
in a straightforward way to include interactions between
multiple regions of the world, without the need for powerful numerical simulations.
As already noted in [3], rather than the number of
cases, it is convenient to discuss its logarithm, which is
a more slowly varying function. We define through it an
epidemic strength function
α(t) = ln I(t) ,

(1)

where I(t) is the total number of infected cases per million inhabitants in the region, and ln indicates its natural logarithm. The derivative of α with respect to time
provides a new quantity that we interpret as the betafunction of an underlying microscopic model. In statistical and high energy physics, the latter governs the time
(inverse energy) dependence of the interaction strength
among fundamental particles. Here it regulates infectious
interactions.
More specifically, as the renormalisation group equations in high energy physics are expressed in terms of
derivatives with respect to the energy µ, it is natural to
identify the time as t/t0 = − ln µ/µ0 , where t0 and µ0 are
respectively a reference time and energy scale. We choose
t0 to be one week so that time is measured in weeks, and
will drop it in the following. Thus, the dictionary between the eRG equation for the epidemic strength α and
the high-energy physics analog is
β(α) =

It has been shown in [3] that α captures the essential
information about the infected population within a sufficiently isolated region of the world. The pandemic beta

of people between the two regions: this is a reasonable
approximation during a short time as immigration only
involves a smaller fraction of inhabitants than that involved in the epidemic. We further use the approximation that the rate of infected cases within the travelling
subset of people is the same as the rate of infected cases in
the total population of each region. Thus, the variation
in the number of infected cases per million in region-1 is
given by 1
nm1

(4)

The dynamics encoded in Eq. (3) is that of a system that
flows from an UV fixed point at t = −∞ where α = 0 to
an IR fixed point where α = a. The latter value encodes
the total number of infected cases per million expected in
the region under study. The coefficient γ is the diffusion
slope, while b shifts the entire epidemic curve by a given
amount of time. Further details, including what parameter influences the flattening of the curve and location of
the inflection point and its properties can be found in [3].
Note that here we work with number of cases per million,
so that our α corresponds to α − ln nm of [3] with nm the
number of inhabitants per million per each sufficiently
isolated region of the world. In this work, we extend the
eRG formalism to include the diffusion of the epidemic
between multiple nearly-isolated regions.
Our work is organised as follows. In Sec. II we present
the formalism in the simple case of two regions, and study
how the interaction term influences the delay between the
epidemic peak between the first and second regions. We
also investigate the effect of closing the borders at different times between the two regions. In Sec. III we map
the eRG formalism onto time-honoured compartmental
models of the SIR-type. In Sec. IV we test the eRG
formalism by comparing the predictions to data relative
to the COVID-19 epidemic in Europe and in the United
States, and generalise it to include multiple regions at
the same time. We then use the model to simulate a second wave of epidemic diffusion in a sample of European
countries. Finally, we present a discussion of the results
in Sec. V and offer our conclusions.

II. EPIDEMIC DIFFUSION AMONG
DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE GLOBLE

Here we go beyond the state-of-the-art by considering
the diffusion among multiple regions of the world, each
characterised by its own αi (t), which in isolation obeys a
beta function like Eq. (3), with its own γi and ai .
We exemplify the framework by first considering two
regions, and we generalise to multiple ones later. To couple the two equations, we start from the following axiom:
there is a constant number of travellers moving from one
region to the other, and viceversa, given by ∆Ntrav each
week. Our basic simplifying assumption is that the number of travellers is symmetric, i.e. there is no net flow

δI1 (t)
= k (I2 (t) − I1 (t)) ,
δt

(5)

where nm1 is the population of region-1 in millions and
k = 10−6 ∆Ntrav .

(6)

For region-2, we find the analogous
nm2

δI2 (t)
= k (I1 (t) − I2 (t)) ,
δt

(7)

where the same k applies. Physically, the parameter k
measures the number of reciprocal travellers per week
in units of million people. For instance, if the number
of weekly travellers is ∆Ntrav = 1000, then k = 10−3 .
Using the identity
δαi
δIi (t)
= Ii
,
δt

(8)

the effect of this exchange can be encoded in the two beta
functions, c.f. Eq. (3), as follows:

The above equations describe the evolution of the epidemic across the two regions, once a small fraction of the
population travels between the two. However, for large
k, they have the interesting property of forcing α1 = α2 ,
which in turn modifies the value of the fixed point for the
two regions. The fact that the α’s become equal in the
long run indicates that the two regions have merged into
one. One surprising finding is that the total number of
infected cases across the two regions, for large k, may be
reduced compared to the isolated case (see details in Appendix A). While mathematically intriguing, we do not
consider this result physical, as having large k modifies
the values of αi and γi in the two regions compared to
the values one would have in case of isolation. In other
words it would violate our initial assumption that the
two regions are nearly-isolated, with small k. One can

Here we neglect the fact that part of the infected population has
recovered, thus probably ceasing to be infectious. We will come
back to discussing the validity of this approximation.

go beyond the realistic case envisioned here by increasing k. This would require modifying the set of equations
substantially and goes beyond the scope of this work.
To quantitatively estimate the interaction between two
regions of the world, we consider benchmark values for
the parameters in the two beta functions using the results
given in [3]. We show in Table I the values of a and γ for
various regions of the world for the COVID-19 pandemic
[3]. a is normalised per million inhabitants and all values
are adjourned to the 4th of May, 2020. 2 The values of γ
and a are average values over the whole duration of the
epidemic diffusion in each country/region. We observe
that the value of γ tends to diminish over time as a consequence of the effect of gradual implementing of social
distancing measures in each region. At the early stages
of the epidemic, we observe γ ∼ 1, so that we will consider this as a benchmark value for the epidemic diffusion
without any restriction.
With the exception of South Korea and China (Hubei
province), the range for a is roughly [7.5, 8.6], while for γ
we find [0.4, 0.76]. Thus, we defined the following benchmark scenario for the two regions:
(11)

while we vary the values of γ1 and γ2 as specified in the
figures. The value of b2 = 200 is chosen such that the
peak in the two regions in isolation have a relative delay
of 14 weeks. The peak is here defined as the week where
the maximum number of new infected cases per million
is registered and corresponds to the inflection point of

It is straightforward to provide daily updates, as done following
the eRG approach [3] at http://caracal.imada.sdu.dk/corona/
for different regions of the world.

the total number of infected cases curve. The explicit
formula for the inflection point time as function of the
parameters of the theory can be found in [3].
As a first sanity check, we computed the total number
of infected cases across the two regions, per million, at
the end of the pandemic, i.e. at infinite time. This is
given by
I1+2 (∞) =

nm1 I1 (∞) + nm2 I2 (∞)
,
nm1 + nm2

(12)

as a function of k. The result allows us to determine the
largest value of k that does not affect the total number,
i.e. the largest value that k can have before the two
regions effectively merge into one. In Fig. 1 we show
the results for two different populations. The plot shows
that k as large as 0.1 is allowed before our description of
the coupled system breaks down. Note that the maximal
value of k grows linearly with the population in region-2,
as it enters as the ratio k/nm2 in the coupled differential
equations.
A.

Peak delay study

To understand how the interaction encoded by k affects the diffusion of the epidemic in the two regions, we
study the same benchmark of Eq. (11), except that we
set b2 = ∞, i.e. the region-2 remains with zero infected
cases if isolated. One caveat that should be kept in mind
is that the values for γ in Table I are obtained by fitting the data during the whole period of the epidemic,
i.e. they take into account the effect of social distancing
measures in each region. However, at the early stages of
the epidemic, when social distancing measures were not
yet being enforced, we expect larger values of γ. That is
the reason why, in the following, we assume γ = 1 as the
natural initial benchmark value. Nevertheless, we show
how different social distancing measures impact the results for region-2 by showing also the results for smaller
values of γ2 .

of weekly travellers between the two regions is in the order of the thousands, so we consider k = 5 × 10−3 as a
benchmark. This means that

For this value, the bottom plot in Fig. 2 allows us to
estimate the peak delay to be around 6 weeks for γ2 = 1,
i.e. for unrestricted diffusion within Italy. This nicely
confirms our expectations while validating the model.
It is useful to note that both k and b2 lead to a temporal shift of the epidemic curve for region-2, however
the underlying mechanisms are distinct. The former is
due to an interaction between two different regions of
the world, while the latter is a constant of integration
that depends on the number of cases at the initial time
t = 0 in region-2. This also means that a specific peak
time for region-2 relative to region-1 can emerge as a
combination of the two effects, interpolating between the
two limiting cases: the peak delay is entirely due to the
interaction with region-1, or it is due to the presence of
cases in region-2 (which may have different origin) and
the coupling to region-1 is negligible. We will discuss this
interplay in more details in the next section.

for γ1 = 0.4 (top) and γ1 = 0.75 (bottom), and different
values for γ2 .

We discover that the interaction among the two regions
of the world, controlled by the parameter k, is sufficient
to ignite the spread of the epidemic to region-2 and it also
controls the timing of the peak. This is shown in Fig. 2,
where we plot the time of the peaks in the two regions as
a function of k/nm2 . The result does not depend on nm1 .
Also, the time of the peak for region-1 is unaffected by
the value of k (dashed curve) while it affects the timing
of the peak for region-2 (solid curves). Note that the kterm in Eq. (10) sparks the epidemic diffusion in region-2
k
as soon as nm2
eα1 (t) becomes sizeable. After this point,
the epidemic evolution follows the solution of the initial
equation (3), as encoded in the first term of the region-2
beta function.
The numerical results for the peak delay show a linear
dependence on ln k, with a change in slope appearing for
k/nm2 ∼ 10−3 . This value corresponds to

(13)

i.e. it marks the threshold (grey line in the plots) between
the regime where the interaction term is always smaller
than one, and the one where strength 1 is attainable.
To test our approach we consider the COVID-19 epidemic spread from China (Hubei province) to Europe
(Italy). From data it is known that the peaks in the two
regions are about 7 weeks apart. A reasonable estimate

B.

Border control versus social distancing

We now turn out attention on the impact of closing
the borders between two regions of the globe versus different degree of social distancing. In the eRG approach
this is implemented by setting to zero k after the closing time tcl . We consider the benchmark values given in
Eq. (11), while the impact of social distancing is encoded
in region-2 in varying the value for γ2 . Furthermore we
consider two scenarios: one in which region-2 has zero
initial cases, meaning that the epidemic would not occur
for k = 0 (corresponding to b2 = ∞) and another where
we fix the initial condition according to the benchmark
(corresponding to b2 = 200).
The results are shown in Fig. 3, where we report the
delay in the peak of region-2 caused by closing the borders (i.e., delay relative to the case of tcl = ∞). Such a
delay depends crucially on the value of γ2 in region-2 as
shown in the top plot when the epidemic in region-2 is
only driven by the interaction term. In particular the results show that a significant delay in the spreading of the
epidemic can be achieved only if the closing is enacted
before the peak in region-1 (which is unaffected by k).
In the bottom panel we show the case where region-2
features already some initial cases, so that tcl = 0 would
correspond to isolated regions with both featuring infected cases. In this case, we also see that the effect of
the interaction is more pronounced for small values of
γ2 in region-2, indicated by the red curve for γ2 = 0.4.
For this value of γ2 , isolation would yield a delay of 4.5
weeks in the peak. For larger values of γ2 (less social
distancing) the peak delay is strongly reduced to within

relevant if done before the peak in region-1 is attained.
Our results, obtained using the simple and effective
eRG approach, agree qualitatively with the ones presented in [16] obtained using a numerical analysis. The
take home message is that social distancing plays the
dominant role in curbing and delaying the epidemic
spread in region-2 with respect to seed region-1.

III.

RELATION TO THE SIR MODEL

Epidemic dynamics is often described in terms of simplistic compartmental models introduced long time ago in
[15]. Here, the affected population is described in terms
of compartmentalised sub-populations that have different
roles in the dynamics. Then, differential equations are
designed to describe the time evolution of the various
sub-populations. For an application to the COVID-19
epidemic, see [17, 18]. The sub-populations can be chosen
to represent (S)usceptible, (I)nfected and (R)ecovered individuals (SIR model), obeying the following differential

(16)
(17)

where P = S + I + R is a constant, measuring the total
number of individuals affected. As the equations do not
depend on the normalisation of the number of individuals, we can consider them for cases per million. Due to
the constant P , only two equations are independent, so
that we can drop the one for S. The total number of
infected, I(t), we study in our model is related to the
above sub-populations as
I(t) = I(t) + R(t) .

2

(15)

(18)

We can therefore re-write the two independent SIR equations as


dI(t)
I(t)
= γ̃ (I(t) − R(t)) 1 −
,
(19)
dt
P
dR(t)
=  (I(t) − R(t)) .
(20)
dt
Eq. (19) has a form similar to Eq. (3), except for the
following: it is written in terms of the total number I(t)
instead of its log α(t); it contains a dependence on the
number of recovered cases, R(t).
Thus, our eRG approach would be equivalent to the
SIR model if we could drop the R(t) dependence in the
differential equation for I(t). It is conceivable that this
is the case: in fact, in Eq. (19) we can already see that
the second factor drives the number of infected cases to
the fixed point I(∞) → P ≡ ea , which corresponds to
the IR fixed point in the eRG approach. R(t), instead,
is zero at early times and only grows slowly as long as
the recovery rate  is small, thus its effect should remain
negligible once the dynamics of I(t) is driven towards the
fixed point. As investigated in [3], the dynamics of I(t)
and α(t) can be described by the same equation, as they
both are driven to flow between the two fixed points.
Once a solution for I(t) is found following the eRG
approach, i.e. Eq. (3), the number of recovered cases can
be calculated by solving Eq. (20), with solution
Z t
R(t) = 
dx e(x−t) I(x) .

0

To validate this approach and calibrate , we compared
the above formula to the number of recovered cases for
the United States (US), where I(t) is obtained using the
fit values in Table I: the results are shown in Fig. 4,
where R(t) (in red) reproduces the data for  = 0.09. We
checked that for other countries, a similarly good fit can
be obtained for  ∼ 0.1, thus we consider this description
consistent.

and similarly for Eq. (7). We have compared the solutions of the coupled differential equations with and without taking into account the recovered cases, and found
that including Ri (t) only affects the epidemic diffusion in
region-2 by a few days. Thus, this effect can be neglected
in first approximation.

To establish a more quantitative dictionary between
the eRG approach and the SIR model, we compared the
numerical solutions of the SIR equations (19) and (20)
to the solutions of the beta function in Eq. 3 (with R(t)
given by Eq. (21)). We find that the solutions overlap as
long as matching values of γ and γ̃ are used. In Fig. 5 we
show the numerical relation between the matching values
of the couplings for 3 choices of the recovery rate : the
result shows a linear relation between the couplings in
the two models.
Being able to reproduce the number of recovered cases
for one region in isolation, we can now address the issue
of the effect of the recovered cases in the coupled system.
In fact, the transmission of the epidemic due to travel of
individuals between the two regions is only due to the
presence of people actively infected, namely it depends
on
I(t) = I(t) − R(t) .

(22)

Thus, it suffices to replace the expression in Eq. (5) with

We now confront the eRG framework to data
from the COVID-19 pandemic collected from
www.worldometers.info and adjourned to the 4th
of May, 2020. Although we are well aware of the pitfalls
stemming from comparing data provided by different
countries due to the inhomogeneous way infectious
cases were tested and reported, it is still possible to
extract from these reliable time behaviour and structure.
Of course, when coupling two regions of the world,
part of the initial uncertainty also affects the epidemic
transmission probability without affecting the overall
picture.
Nevertheless, we will now see that the eRG formalism
can be used simultaneously to quantiately project the
spreading dynamics across different regions of the world,
or as an a-posteriori way to learn how this spreading came
to be. We focus on two examples, one intra European
(Italy-Denmark) and the other between Europe and the
US. The values for γ and a for each country are taken
from the fit in Table I, which assumes isolation.

A.

From Italy to Denmark

In the right plot of Fig. 6 we show the total number
of infected cases in Italy and Denmark (blue and red
dots, respectively), compared to the fit in Table I (solid
curves): the latter assumes that the epidemic occurred
in the two regions while in isolation. We now wish to
understand how and whether the virus spread from Italy
to Denmark: thus, we used the coupled Eqs (9) and (10),
while we set the number of initial cases in Denmark to
be null, i.e. b2 = ∞. All the other parameters are fixed
to the values in the Table. We find that the two curves
can be reasonably fit by assuming k = 0.16, as shown in
the left plot of Fig. 6: the dashed orange curve, corresponding to Italy, overlaps to the isolated fit (solid blue),
while the new curve for Denmark (dashed green) is close
to the isolated fit (solid red). Let us now comment on the
actual value of k. If we take it literally this it would correspond to a rate of 160.000 travellers between the two
regions each week. This is an unreasonably large value
but it can be alternatively and conservatively interpreted
in the following ways:

(right plot) and the fits in our two-region eRG model.

i) The original spreading dynamics in Denmark is
due to few very socially active infected individuals
that traveled back from Italy and/or were superspreaders;

iii) A combination of the above.
Whatever the reason, it is naturally incorporated in a
larger value of k. One can also take into account the various scenarios by effectively re-instating an initial value
for α2 at t = 0 while reducing the k value.

From Europe to the United States

To further test our model we consider the system consisting of Europe as region-1 and the United States as
region-2. For simplicity, we modelled Europe on the European Union (with nm1 = 445) with parameters from
the fit of the epidemic diffusion in Italy (c.f., Table I).
After setting to zero the initial cases in the US, we were
able to reproduce the diffusion of the epidemic in region2 (US) for k = 10, as shown in the right plot of Fig. 6.
While it is still possible that the large value for k may
be interpreted as in the above case, it has the further effect of distorting the epidemic curve for region-1, the EU,
thus suggesting that it may be hard to explain the diffusion of the COVID-19 epidemic in the US as originating
solely from the EU.
At this stage, we cannot exclude that adjusting the
epidemic parameters in the EU could improve the agreement. This exercise, nevertheless, proves the effectiveness of our simple eRG model to describe the diffusion
of the epidemic among different regions of the world. A
more accurate fit may be obtained if more than one region is included in the analysis, which will be considered
in a future work.

Multiple country system: A new simulated
epidemic spread in Europe

We now use the eRG framework to model the impact
of a new wave of epidemic spread of the COVID-19 virus
(or a related one) in Europe. To do so, we simulate the
effect of transmission among countries in a pool of European countries, namely Italy, Spain, France, the United
Kingdom, Germany, Denmark and Switzerland. We also
include an unspecified “seed region”, with a population
of nm0 = 50, which has some initial cases, while no case
is initially present for the simulated European countries.
This is achieved by setting bi = ∞, where i = 1, . . . 7
spans over the 7 sample countries mentioned above.
We generate randomly the diffusion factors γi in
the range [0.4, 0.76], based on the data of the current
COVID-19 epidemic in Europe, and also generate random values of ai in the range [7.5, 8.5]. This also includes
the seed region. Finally, we provide randomly generated
numbers of travellers between each of the regions, including the seed one, giving coupling values kij in the range
[1, 10] × 10−3 . We then solve the 8 coupled differential
equations:

dαi
αi
kij αj −αi

where i, j = 0, . . . 7 and α0 corresponds to the seed region. The result is shown in the top row of Fig. 7, where
black indicates the seed region and the coloured curves
correspond to the 7 sample European countries. The
top-right plot, where the distribution of new cases is displayed, clearly shows that the peaks in the infected regions occur between 3 to 12 weeks after the peak in the
seed region. This effect, however, is mainly due to the
values of the γ’s in those regions, and not on the values
of the interaction couplings kij .
To prove this, we have run the same simulation again,
by fixing γi = 1, i = 1, . . . 7, while γ0 for the seed region
is left the same. All other parameters are kept to the
same values for the previous case. The analogous results
are shown in the bottom row plots of Fig. 7. This case

FIG. 7. Simulation of an epidemic diffusion in a sample of European countries (see text) starting from a “seed region”, in
black. In the top row, the γ coefficients for the European countries are fixed to random values; in the bottom row, they are all
fixed to γ1 = 1. The result shows the importance of social distancing measures within each region with respect to the diffusion
due to travel.

roughly correspond to unrestricted diffusion of the virus
in the target regions. The result shows that all the peaks
are now occurring within 4 weeks after the peak in the
seed region.
The results nicely demonstrate that our eRG framework not only is useful, simple and effective to understand the current pandemic, but can also be used to
model future ones.

CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

We extended the epidemic renormalisation group approach to analyse the dynamics of disease transmission
and spreading across different regions of the world. We
have shown that the eRG framework constitutes an effective way to understand the relative impact of border
control versus social distancing measures on the global
spread of the epidemic. The simplicity of the approach,
stemming from an effective description of complex phenomena, make it a reliable alternative to the use of expensive high-performance numerical computations.
We calibrated our approach via internationally reported cases. The approach elucidates the underlying
mechanism that governs the delay in the relative peaks of
newly infected cases across different regions of the world.
Among our results, we were able to demonstrate that social distancing measures are more efficient than border

control in delaying the epidemic peak.
In order to connect with widely used time-honoured
compartmental models of the SIR-like type, we established the proper map with our eRG framework. We
have also shown how to generalise the eRG framework
to account for the epidemic interactions across multiple
regions of the world.
We foresee a number of future applications and extensions of our seed work. From a more phenomenological
point of view, of immediate impact for society, we plan
on embarking on a world-wide monitoring to make global
projections that will help governments and industries
make containment plans and strategise about reopening
society and how to best implement border control. We
also wish to improve on understanding the link between
the eRG approach and microscopic models of population dynamics and epidemic spread including a number
of granular effects that are, by construction, averaged
over by effective descriptions such as the eRG approach.

Appendix A: Asymptotic behaviour for large k

The coupled system of beta functions in Eqs (9)
and (10) has an interesting solution in the limit for large
k. While this limit should be considered unphysical, it
is intriguing from a mathematical point of view. Moreover, it may lead to some insights on the dynamics of two

regions merging into a single one.
In the limit of large k → ∞, the interaction term in
the two beta functions dominates. It thus forces α1 = α2
asymptotically. To check if there is a fixed point, we
can take the sum of the two functions, eliminating the
k-term, and search for zeros:

Interestingly, as the exponential in the numerator may
be negative, it is possible to have a reduction in the total
number of cases when the exchange of people is large. In
Fig. 8 we show numerically the above ratio, for nm2 =
nm1 (top plot) and nm2 = 10 nm1 (bottom plot), and
for various values of g (we recall that −1 < g < 1). To
make sense of the result, let’s consider the case of similar
slope in the two countries, i.e. γ1 = γ2 . In the case
nm1 = nm2 , this would give g = 0, i.e. the blue curve in
the top plot: this case features a reduction of the total
cases, as long as a1 6= a2 . For nm2 = 10 nm2 , we have
g ≈ 1, corresponding to the orange curve in the bottom
plot: again, there is a significant reduction for a1 > a2 ,

values g = 1 (orange) and g = −1 (green). We fixed A = 12,
but the results have a mild dependence on its value.

while the increase if minor if a2 > a1 . Of course, these
results are just illustrative, because the values of ai and
γi should be influenced by the policies concerning the
movement of people between infected regions.
