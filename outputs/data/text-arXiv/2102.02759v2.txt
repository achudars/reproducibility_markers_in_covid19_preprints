Abstract
We have further extended our compartmental model describing the spread of the infection in Italy.
The model is based on the assumption that the time evolution of all of the observable quantities
(number of people still positive to the infection, hospitalized and fatalities cases, healed people, and
total number of people that has contracted the infection) depend on average parameters, namely
people diffusion coefficient, infection cross–section, and population density. The model provides
precious information on the tight relationship between the variation of the reported infection cases
and a well defined observable physical quantity: the average number of people that lie within the
daily displacement area of any single person. The extension of the model now includes self–consistent
evaluation of the reproduction index, effect of immunization due to vaccination, and potential impact
of virus variants on the dynamical evolution of the outbreak. The model fits very well the epidemic
data, and allows us to strictly relate the time evolution of the number of hospitalized case and fatalities
to the change of people mobility, vaccination rate, and appearance of an initial concentration of people
positives for new variants of the virus.

Introduction
The new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS–CoV–2),
initially started in the city of Wuhan, China,1–4 has transformed into a pandemic that has affected a
large number of countries around the world.5–7 Models are extremely useful to identify physical key
parameters influencing the spread of infection and thus taking appropriate measures to limit serious
consequences of the influenza/SARS pandemics.3–4,7–14
In this work we present a further extension of our theoretical description,8 based on the
assumption that spreading of viral infection can be described by a simple diffusion process, controlled
mainly by a diffusion coefficient that changes in time accordingly to the people mobility restriction
measures adopted in the course of the outbreak. The description is based on a compartmental model
that allows us to accurately follow the time evolution of the observable quantities characterizing the
virus outbreak: people tested positive for the virus, people tested as healed (i.e. negative, after a period
from the infection, to the test for the virus), hospitalized people, fatalities, and total number of those
who has been infected. We report on the tight correlation between people mobility and time evolution
of hospitalized and fatalities cases, by examining, in particular, the data of the outbreak in Italy. The
effect of vaccination is now included in the model, in order to analyze the best condition of easing
the mobility restriction measures as a function of the implemented daily vaccination rate.
Most recently, there is also an increasing concern regarding to the possible appearance of virus
variants, characterized by higher level of transmissibility or symptom severity. The model allows us
to describe these effects and their impact on the risk of triggering new epidemic waves. Our approach
allows us to get a fast feedback of the restriction measures adopted to reduce people mobility and a
prediction of the evolution scenarios on the basis of a fit to the experimental available data.

Experimental data: the Covid–19 outbreak in Italy
In Italy, as of January the 31th, 2021, a total of 2,553,032 cases of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID–19) and 88,516 deaths have been confirmed.15 These data are shown in Fig. 1, in semi–
logarithmic plots as a function of time. The data refer to the numbers of hospitalized people (open
circles), people tested positive for the virus (open triangles), and fatalities (open squares) of the
Covid–19 outbreak in Italy as a whole [Fig. 1(a)], and in three different National Italian Regions:
Lombardia [Fig. 1(b)], Sicily [Fig. 1(c)], and Lazio [Fig. 1(d)], since February 2020, the 24th. After
the initial sudden increase of the number of cases, Italy implemented measures aimed to limit people
mobility from March 2020 the 9th to June 2020 the 14th. The consequence of such measures was a
significant slowdown of the outbreak diffusion, following by a decrease in the number of positive
and hospitalized cases, extended until end of July 2020. Easing of mobility restriction measures
induced a new increase of cases, by triggering the second wave of the outbreak lasting until nowadays.

Fig. 1 Experimental data of hospitalized people (open circles), fatalities (open squares), people tested positive for the
viral infection (open triangles), since the beginning of the Covid–19 outbreak in Italy (a), in Lombardia (b), in Sicily (c),
and in Lazio (d).

Methods
The model proposed to describe time evolution of the total number of infected people, positive
cases, healed people, deaths, and hospitalized people, during the Covid–19 outbreak is based on a
mean–field approximation. This consists in the assumption that the probability for an individual to
contract the infection is uniformly proportional to the concentration 𝑝 of positive circulating cases,
to a diffusion coefficient 𝐷, equal to the surface area covered on average by each person in a day, and
to an infection cross–section 𝜎 related to the probability of a single infection event (𝜎 = 𝜋𝑅 , 𝑅
being the average distance within which a healthy person can be infected by a positive one). This
cross–section is a quantity specifically dependent on the virus infectiousness. We assume it is
constant everywhere all over the examined geographic area and can change only in the presence of
virus variants. In particular, the dimensionless probability  of a single infection event is related to

3

the infection cross–section by the relationship 𝜂 = 𝜌 𝜎 , where 𝜌 is the density of inhabitants.
Under these hypotheses, at any instant 𝑡, the increase 𝑑𝑝 of people positive for viral infection in the
time interval 𝑑𝑡 can be expressed as:
𝑑𝑝
𝑑𝑔 𝑑𝑚
= 𝜌 𝐷𝜎 (𝜌 − 𝑐)𝑝 −
−
𝑑𝑡
𝑑𝑡
𝑑𝑡

(1)

𝑔 is the concentration of healed people (infected people who are tested negative for the virus after a
certain time interval from the infection), 𝑚 is the concentration of fatalities, and 𝑐 is the total
concentration of those who have contracted the virus at the time 𝑡.
A fraction 𝑓 of the new positive cases requires hospital care and, consequently, the
concentration 𝑟 of hospitalized people will change, in the time interval 𝑑𝑡, by a quantity 𝑑𝑟 given by:
𝑑𝑟
𝑞 1−𝑞
= 𝑓𝜌 𝐷𝜎 (𝜌 − 𝑐)𝑝 −
+
𝑟
𝑑𝑡
𝜏
𝜏

(2)

where we further consider that 𝑟 diminishes, in the same time interval 𝑑𝑡, because a fraction 𝑞 of
hospitalized people dies in a characteristic time 𝜏 , whilst the complementary fraction (1 − 𝑞) heals
in a characteristic time 𝜏 . As a consequence, the concentration 𝑚 of fatalities will vary with time
according to the following equation:
𝑑𝑚 𝑞
= 𝑟
𝑑𝑡
𝜏

(3)

While the fraction 𝑓 of positive people is hospitalized, the fraction (1 − 𝑓) does not exhibit
serious symptoms until complete healing. Their concentration 𝑠 will vary with time according to the
following relationship:
𝑑𝑠
𝑠
= (1 − 𝑓)𝜌 𝐷𝜎 (𝜌 − 𝑐)𝑝 −
𝑑𝑡
𝜏

(4)

𝜏 being the characteristic time toward healing for these individuals. As reported in Ref. 16, this
characteristic time is typically larger than 𝜏 , i.e. the one used for describing time dependent healing
of the most severe hospitalized cases (Eq. 2). As a consequence, the time dependence of the
concentration 𝑔 of healed people changes with time according to:
𝑑𝑔
𝑠 (1 − 𝑞)𝑟
= +
𝑑𝑡 𝜏
𝜏

(5)

Finally, the total concentration 𝑐 of those who have contracted the infection will vary on time
according to the following relationship:
𝑑𝑐
= 𝜌 𝐷𝜎 (𝜌 − 𝑐)𝑝
𝑑𝑡

(6)

Our description is based on the assumption that the dynamics of all the observable variables, 𝑝,
𝑟, 𝑚, 𝑔, 𝑐, can be described in terms of the time dependence of the diffusion coefficient 𝐷 = 𝐷, while
keeping constant the infection cross–section to the value of = 3.14 m2 (corresponding to 𝑅 = 1 m).

Results and discussion
Modelling the epidemic evolution in Italy before 2020 holiday season
The values of the diffusion coefficient D, from February the 24th, 2020 until December the 20th,
2020 (i.e. a few days before holiday season in Italy), are plotted in Fig. 2(b) (open lozenges). These
values were extracted from the data of the hospitalized cases [open circles in Fig. 2(a)] by adopting
the analytical procedure described in detail in Ref. [8].

Covid–19 outbreak until December the 20th, 2020. (b) Corresponding values of the diffusion coefficient (open lozenges)
extracted from the data of hospitalized cases. Continuous line in (b) is the result of a fit to the D values by using a set of
logistic functions (Eq. 7). This functional form is used to model hospitalized cases and fatalities represented by the
continuous lines plotted in (a). Dashed lines represent the model simulation corresponding to a decrease of the diffusion
coefficient, after October the 20th, to the level, DL, reached during the global spring lockdown.

We decided to extract the functional form of D and all the other relevant model parameters
from a fit to the data of hospitalized cases since they are more reliable than the ones concerning the
5

number of people tested positive for the virus. Indeed, the latters represent only a small fraction of
the real corresponding concentration values, since they refer to the cases actually detected through
the adopted testing procedure (swabs), restricted to a defined relatively small sample of the entire
population. In Fig. 2(b), the strong reduction of the diffusion coefficient to its minimum value
𝐷 =2.673105 km2 day–1 is a consequence of the general lockdown in spring 2020, followed by a
moderate increase during summer, when the mobility restriction rules were loosened. At the end of
September 2020, people mobility increased at a higher rate, due to the resumption of school and work
activity in more conventional modalities (compared to those based on work and school from home,
experienced during the general spring lockdown). The fast increase of the diffusion coefficient in the
first half of October 2020 has triggered the start of the second wave of the Covid–19 epidemic in
Italy, accompanied by an exponential growth of the number of hospitalized people [Fig. 2(a)] in the
following month.
On October the 25th, 2020 [arrows in Fig. 2(b)] the Italian Government enacted further mobility
restriction rules that induced a new decrease of the diffusion coefficient. These measures were
significantly different Regions by Regions. A few of them, the so–called red Regions, experienced
mobility restrictions very similar to the ones adopted during spring lockdown. For other Regions the
measures were slightly less restrictive (orange Regions) up to a situation characterized by the
persistence of a relatively high level of mobility with a limited number of restrictions (yellow
Regions). The inhomogeneous intensity of the new mobility restriction rules reflects on the
circumstance that the diffusion coefficient approached, at the beginning of December 2020, a constant
value that was about 1.8 times higher than the one reached during the general, homogeneous spring
lockdown. Continuous line in Fig. 2(b) is the result of a fit to the D values, as a function of time, by
using a set of logistic functions of the kind of:8
𝐷=𝐷 +

𝐷 −𝐷
𝑡−𝑡
exp 𝜏
+1

(7)

where 𝑡 is the time around which we observe change of the diffusion coefficient from 𝐷 to 𝐷 and
𝜏 is the characteristic duration of such a variation. In order to follow the variation of 𝐷 as a function
of time, the parameters 𝐷 , 𝐷 , 𝑡 , 𝜏 where adjusted to their best fit values within four different time
ranges: i) from February the 24th to June the 4th, 2020 (start of the Covid–19 epidemic monitoring in
Italy); ii) from June the 4th to September the 22nd, 2020; iii) from September the 22nd to October the
25th, 2020; iv) for times beyond October the 25th, 2020. In particular, the last change of mobility
(beyond October the 25th, 2020) was modeled by setting 𝐷 =1.428106 km2day–1, 𝐷 =4.811105
km2day–1 (i.e., 𝐷 = 1.8 𝐷 ), 𝑡 = 260 days away from the start of the Covid–19 epidemic
monitoring in Italy, and 𝜏 = 7.6 days.
We used the functional form describing the variation of D as a function of time for calculating
the expected values r (hospitalized people) and m (total number of fatalities), through Eqs. 1 to 6, and
by adjusting the other model parameters by a fit to the data of Fig. 2(a), with the exception of the
characteristic times 𝜏 (healing of hospitalized people) and 𝜏 (healing of infected, but not

6

hospitalized people) that were set to the values found in the literature (𝜏 = 20 days, 𝜏 = 14 days).16
The results of such a procedure are the continuous lines plotted in Fig. 2(a). The agreement of the
theoretical curves with the experimental data is excellent. The best–fit values found for f (fraction of
the new infected persons that require hospitalization), 𝜏 (characteristic time for death), q (fraction of
hospitalized people that die in the characteristic time 𝜏 ) were: f = 0.35%, 𝜏 = 7.2 days, q = 14% in
the time range February 24th ≤ 𝑡 ≤ May the 13rd, q = 10% in the time range May 13rd < 𝑡 ≤
November the 14th, q = 15% for 𝑡 > November the 14th. In the same plots, dashed lines is the
simulation of what would have occurred, according to the proposed theoretical model, if the diffusion
coefficient, after October the 20th, had approached the same value experienced in the occasion of the
spring general lockdown.
The same analytical procedure was applied to model the evolution of epidemic data at a more
geographically circumscribed level, by investigating the behavior of three Italian Regions that, on
November the 5th, 2020, were subjected to different restriction mobility measures: Lombardia (“red
zone”: severe mobility restriction measures), Sicilia (“orange zone": medium level of mobility
restriction measures), Lazio (“yellow zone”: extremely soft mobility restriction measures). The
results are shown in Fig. 3. The model fits very well the hospitalized cases [full lines in Fig.
3(a),(b),(c)] and number of fatalities [full lines in Fig. 3(d),(e),(f)] by using the functional time
dependences of D plotted as continuous lines in Fig. 3(g),(h),(i). Dashed lines are simulations of the
behaviour we would have observed if the diffusion coefficient had decreased, after October the 20th,
2020, to the corresponding spring lockdown values DL. We notice that, in the range October the 20th
– December the 20th, the diffusion coefficient decreases to a plateau level that is different for the three
examined Regions. Compared to the corresponding spring lockdown values DL, the ratio 𝐷⁄𝐷
approaches 1.5 for Lombardia, 1.8 for Sicily, and 2.2 for Lazio, respectively. Thus, the model allows
us to strictly relate the temporal evolution of the epidemic data to the change of people mobility
(diffusion coefficient) occurring as a consequence of restriction measures of different level of
severity.

Parameter values used to fit the theoretical model to the data shown in Fig. 3

The model fitting parameters are listed in Tab. I. Also in this case (as for Italy as whole) we
need to use values of the parameter q that are different within three different time range (the first
range is centered on the first wave of the outbreak, the second one corresponds to the summer
characterized by a relatively small number of cases, and the third range is around the peak of the
second wave).

if the diffusion coefficient had decreased to DL (the spring lockdown value) after October the 20th, 2020.

Effect of mobility increase occurred during 2020 holiday season
After December the 20th, 2020, the Italian Government decided to slightly relax the mobility
restriction measures in the occasion of holiday season. The corresponding increase of people mobility
reflected in a significant slowdown of the decreasing rate of the hospitalized cases as shown in Fig.
4(a).

and on holiday season 2020. (c) Evolution of the diffusion coefficient, in the same time range, normalized to the spring
lockdown value DL. Continuous lines are fit of the model to the data. Dashed lines are reference curves corresponding to
the hypothesis of a general lockdown on October the 20th, 2020. Dot–dashed lines describe the situation we would have
experienced if restriction mobility measures had maintained unchanged during holiday season.

The proposed theoretical description allows us to interpret this effect in terms of variation of
the diffusion coefficient, referred again to the spring lockdown value DL,. In particular, Fig. 4(c)
shows that the diffusion coefficient (and the related quantity 𝜌 𝐷 i.e. “average number of people

9

encountered by each person in a day”) increased, during holiday season, from 1.8 to 2.6 times DL.
The reintroduction of more severe mobility restriction measures on January the 7th produced a new
decrease of D. However, these new measures (mostly homogeneous in all the National territory) were
significantly softer than the ones adopted before December the 20th. This circumstance reflects on the
observation that the ratio D / DL approached, after the holiday season peak, a value, for Italy as a
whole, of about 2.1, appreciably higher than the one observed in the pre–peak time interval
(D/DL
= 1.8). The corresponding fits of the model to the hospitalized and fatalities cases are plotted as
continuous lines in Fig. 4.
The simulation of the scenario expected in the presence of a decrease of the diffusion
coefficient, after October the 20th, 2020, to the same value of the spring lockdown is also plotted in
Fig. 4 (dashed lines), whilst dot–dashed lines in the same figure refer to the scenario simulated by
imposing that the diffusion coefficient had remained constant to the value experienced before holiday
season.
The variation of D/DL around the peak value of holiday season has not been uniform among
the different Italian Regions. This is clearly shown in Fig. 5 for Lombardia, Sicily, and Lazio. We
notice that only Lazio has returned to a situation that evolves with a diffusion coefficient that is
constant to the pre–holiday season value. Conversely, the ratio D/DL in Lombardia is approaching
the value of 2.3, significantly larger than the pre–holiday season value (D/DL = 1.5). Sicily has
experienced the most critical situation, with D/DL that as reached, during holiday season, a peak value
as large as 3.6, thus triggering the start of a third wave of the outbreak, well visible in the plot of
hospitalized cases shown in Fig. 5(b). Indeed, beyond the holiday season peak, the ratio D/DL for
Sicily has exhibited a relatively slow decreasing rate and, on January the 15th [see the arrow in Fig.
5(h)], it was still at a level of about 3.3. In particular, dotted lines in Figs. 5(b),5(e),5(h) show the
results of our model simulation under the hypothesis that D/DL for Sicily had approached, after the
holiday season peak, a constant value equal to 3, demonstrating that this value would have been
suitable to fuel the growth of a new wave of the virus epidemic in the Region. On January the 15th,
however, the Italian Government imposed for Sicily more severe mobility restriction measures (“red
zone”), inducing a further decrease of D/DL and a consequent new diminution of the number of
hospitalized people [Fig. 5(b)].

of the model to the data. Dashed lines are reference curves corresponding to the decrease of D, after October the 20th,
2020, to the same value of spring lockdown. Dot–dashed lines describe the situation we would have expected if restriction
mobility measures had maintained unchanged during holiday season. For Sicily, the simulation of a post–peak holiday
season diffusion coefficient that decreases to a level as large as 3 times than DL is shown (dotted lines).

Modelling the impact of vaccine immunization
On December the 27th, 2020, Italy started its vaccination campaign. The investigation of the
clinic effectiveness of the various vaccines that are being used is beyond the aim of this work. Our
model, however, can include the influence of vaccination on the time evolution of the virus epidemic
by assuming that immunization occurs, in general, about one week later from the inoculation of the
second vaccine dose. Then, the concentration 𝜌 of people immunized by vaccination will increase
with time t according to the following relationship:

11

𝜌 (𝑡) =

𝑣(𝑡 − 𝜏)𝑑𝑡

(8)

where t0 is the immunization time onset, corresponding to the day first person has received the second
vaccine dose (January the 16th, 2021, in our case),  = 7 days is the time interval for getting
immunization from the second dose inoculation, and 𝑣(𝑡 − 𝜏) is the number of people that was
vaccinated (second dose) on the day corresponding to 𝑡 − 𝜏.
Under these hypotheses, we can describe the influence of vaccine on the time evolution of all
the observable variables, simply by substituting the term (𝜌 − 𝑐) with (𝜌 − 𝜌 − 𝑐) in Eqs. 1 to 6.
For the daily number of people, 𝑣, receiving the second vaccine dose, we used the data communicated
by the Italian Health Ministry17. In order to simulate the impact of vaccination on the future time
evolution of the virus outbreak, the function 𝑣 was kept constant to the vaccination daily rate
experienced the week prior to the date of the last available data, (January the 31st, 2021).
Vaccination is believed to be one of the best weapons we can use to strike virus outbreak and
come back to highest levels of mobility in a relatively short time range. In order to investigate how
vaccination can help us to increase people mobility, we have simulated several scenarios, shown in
Fig. 6, consisting in a progressive increase of the diffusion coefficient to a level as high as the one
reached at the end of summer 2020 (D/DL = 3.25).

Fig. 6 Diffusion coefficient used for modelling people mobility during the second wave (in course) of the Covid–19
outbreak in Italy. The values are normalized to DL, i.e. the level reached during the general lockdown of spring 2020.
Dotted, dashed, and dot–dashed lines represent different possible scenarios of easing people mobility restriction measures
to allow an increase of the diffusion coefficient to the level experienced at the end of summer 2020 (D/DL = 3.25).
Continuous line describes the situation according to which the diffusion coefficient is maintained constant to the value of
January the 31th, 2021 (D/DL = 2.1)

12

These scenarios differ for the length of the time interval used for allowing the increase of the
diffusion coefficient to the level of the end of summer 2020, starting from January the 31st, 2021: 1
month (dotted line in Fig. 6), 2 months (dashed line in Fig. 6), and 3 months (dot–dashed line in Fig.
6). Instead, continuous line in Fig. 6 describes the situation of maintaining the diffusion coefficient
constant to the present value (D/DL = 2.1).

Fig. 7 Simulation of the number of hospitalized people and fatalities consequent to the increase of people mobility at
the level experienced at the end of summer 2020, according to the time evolution of the diffusion coefficient shown in
Fig. 6. Calculations in (a) and (b) were performed in the absence of vaccination, whilst in (c) and (d) we included the
effect of vaccine immunization by assuming that the average vaccination daily rate keeps constant to the value of the last
week, prior to January the 31st, 2021.

The consequent model simulations of the time evolution of the number of hospitalized people
and fatalities are plotted in Fig. 7, in the absence [Figs. 7(a),7(b)] or in the presence of vaccination
[Figs. 7(c),7(d)]. We notice that vaccine immunization produces only negligible effects on the
decreasing rate of hospitalized people and fatalities for the scenario consisting in maintaining constant
the diffusion coefficient to the present level (D/DL = 2.1), whilst it strongly mitigates the amplitude
of the third wave peak of the outbreak triggered by the increase of people mobility to the levels
measured at the end of summer 2020.

Reproduction number calculation
The proposed model provides a self–consistent method to evaluate the reproduction number
RT, i.e. the number of primary infection produced by a single infected person during the time interval
he remains still positive for the virus (we actually assume that being positive for the virus is a suitable
condition to transmit the infection with a constant probability, independently of the symptoms
severity). In order to get such a result, we start by considering that the concentration 𝑛 of people
infected by a concentration “probe” 𝑝̅(𝜃), initially equal to 𝑝̅ , the new positives for the virus at the
time instant 𝑡, normalized to 𝑝̅ itself, increases, at a time instant 𝜃 ≥ 𝑡, by a quantity 𝑑𝑛 given by:
𝑑𝑛
𝑝̅(𝜃)
= 𝜌 𝐷𝜎 [𝜌 − 𝜌 (𝜃) − 𝑐(𝜃)]
𝑝̅ 𝑑𝜃
𝑝̅

(9)

The function 𝑐(𝜃) is determined, for assigned forms of 𝜌 (𝜃) and 𝐷(𝜃), by solving Eqs. 1 to 6,
whilst 𝑃(𝜃) = 𝑝̅(𝜃)⁄𝑝̅ decays with time according to the rate equations that describe the process of
healing or death of people positives for the virus, i.e.:

(15)

The function 𝑃(𝜃), calculated by setting 𝑓, 𝑞, 𝜏 , 𝜏 , 𝜏 to the values used to fit the model to
the data of hospitalized people and fatalities for Italy as a whole, is plotted in Fig. 8. 𝑃(𝜃) is nothing
but the probability that a single infected individual, contracting the viral infection at a given instant
𝜃 = 0, is still positive and able, in turn, to infect susceptible people at a subsequent time 𝜃 > 0.
𝑅 is defined as the number of people infected by a single individual, positive for the virus at
the certain instant 𝑡, throughout his full lifetime (until healing or death), and then:

turn, susceptible people) days after the initial instant of his infection.

Since 𝑅 is the result of a time integration, the instant, T, the determination of RT should be
referred to is equal to the time average weighted on 𝑑𝑛, i.e. the number of people that a single positive
infects per unit of time throughout his lifetime:

(17)

The time dependence of RT calculated by Eq. 16, as a function of the corresponding time T
expressed by Eq. 17, is plotted in Fig. 9 for the different scenarios of people mobility variations
described in Fig. 6. By the direct comparison of Fig. 9 to Figs. 6 and 7, we notice that the increase of
the diffusion coefficient to the level experienced at the end of summer 2020 in Italy, corresponds to
the increase of the reproduction number above 1 and it is responsible for the triggering of a new wave
of the virus outbreak.

15

Fig. 9 Reproduction number RT as a function of time corresponding to the different scenarios of variation of the
diffusion coefficient illustrated in Fig. 6.

We finally observe that the integral term in Eq. 16 can be thought as the average number Γ of
people, not yet infected (“susceptible people”), that a single positive individual meets throughout his
lifetime, since the onset of his infection. Thus, we can conclude that RT is proportional to Γ, the
proportionality constant being 𝜌 𝜎 , i.e. the probability of a single infection event.
Nowadays, the Covid–19 outbreak in the Italian Regions we have analyzed (Lombardia, Sicily,
and Lazio) is actually characterized by similar values of RT, all of them being below 1: 0.87 for
Lombardia, 0.82 for Sicily, 0.79 for Lazio, 0.83 for Italy as a whole. However, people mobility levels
corresponding to these similar RT values are different Region by Region. This situation is clearly
illustrated in Fig. 10, where RT is plotted as a function of  (the number of susceptible people that a
single positive meets on average throughout his lifetime) for Italy (continuous line), Lombardia
(dashed line), Sicily (dot–dashed line), and Lazio (dotted line). The present (RT , values, as of
January the 31th, 2021, are plotted as open circle, open lozenges, open square, and open triangle,
respectively. We notice that a same value of RT corresponds, for the examined Regions, to different
average number of susceptible people met by a single person positive for the virus during his lifetime.
Setting people mobility to the very same level experienced nowadays on average in Italy (~ 1300),
will produce in Lombardia a significant increase of RT from 0.87 to 1.75, as a direct consequence of
the circumstance that the density of inhabitants of Lombardia is double of that of Italy as a whole.

Modelling the effect of virus variants
Our theoretical description can effectively provide simulation of the influence of virus variants
on the time evolution of hospitalized cases and fatalities. A virus variant is expected to be more
infective and/or or more severe in terms of the fraction of infected people requiring hospitalization.
In the former case we should simply increase the value of the infection cross–section 𝜎 , in the latter
case it is f that has to be changed. In particular, the effect of virus variants can be simulated by
assuming that at, a certain date, the new form of the virus, characterized by different values of 𝜎
and/or f, is present in a small fraction of the active positive population. After that time, the
concentration 𝑝′ of people positive for the virus variant will vary with time according to the same set
of equations, Eqs. 1 to 6, that are simultaneously used to follow the time variation of the concentration
𝑝 of people positive for the standard version of the virus. Of course, Eq. 6, has to be modified to take
into account for the presence of 𝑝 and 𝑝′ in the population of infected people. For virus variant with
different transmissibility 𝜎 and 𝜎 , Eq. 6 transforms in:
𝑑𝑐
= 𝜌 𝐷𝜎 (𝜌 − 𝜌 − 𝑐)𝑝 + 𝜌 𝐷𝜎 (𝜌 − 𝜌 − 𝑐)𝑝′
𝑑𝑡

(18)

whilst, for virus variant characterized by more severe symptoms but same transmissibility, Eq. 6
becomes:
𝑑𝑐
= 𝜌 𝐷𝜎 (𝜌 − 𝜌 − 𝑐)(𝑝 + 𝑝′)
𝑑𝑡

(19)

17

since the variation 𝑓 → 𝑓′ is included in Eq. 2 describing the time evolution of fraction of 𝑝′ that
requires hospitalization. In all of these approximations, we are assuming that all the other parameters
(q, 1, 1, and 1) remain unchanged and that vaccine immunization is still effective for either standard
or variant form of the virus.

Fig. 11 Simulation of impact of virus variant on the time evolution of hospitalized cases (a) and fatalities (b) in Italy.
Calculations were performed by assuming that 1% of the active positives on January the 15th, 2021 were affected by a
virus variant characterized by an infection cross–section higher by a factor 2 (dashed lines), or by a virus variant producing
more severe symptoms, described by an increase by a factor 5 of the fraction of positives requiring hospitalization (dot–
dashed lines). Continuous line is the predicted time evolution of cases in the absence of virus variants at the present level
of mobility (D/DL = 2.1)

Fig. 11 shows the results of simulating the presence, on January the 15th, 2021, of people
positives to virus variant at a concentration equal to 1% of the total active circulating positives. We
performed these calculations by keeping constant the diffusion coefficient to its present value
(D/DL = 2.1) and by considering the case of a virus variant with higher transmissibility (𝜎 = 2𝜎 ,
18

dashed line in Fig. 11) or producing more serious symptoms (𝑓′ = 5𝑓, dot–dashed line in Fig. 11). It
is evident that the appearance of virus variant having a higher transmissibility is the most dangerous
perspective, with respect to the hypothesis that the variant virus characteristics are only limited to the
increase of symptoms severity. It is should also emphasized that the increase of cross–section by a
factor two is obtained by the increase of the characteristic infection distance, R, (𝜎 = 𝜋𝑅 ), by just
40%.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have shown that the spread of COVID–19 virus can be successfully described
by a compartmental model that based on the assumption that the probability of a single infection
event is given by the product between the density of inhabitants and a cross–section measuring the
distance within which a person positive for the virus can infect a healthy one. Through the model, it
is possible to relate the variation of observed hospitalized cases and fatalities to the modification of
the mobility restriction measures, by comparing the present behavior to that already experienced
during the first wave of the outbreak. The model includes the effect of vaccine immunization and the
role of possible virus variants in propagating the infection. The possibility to simulate the time
evolution of the observed cases as a function of a diffusion coefficient function is a powerful tool to
investigate the best tradeoff between increasing people mobility and effects of vaccination and/or
virus variants in order to keep under control the spread of Covid–19 outbreak.
