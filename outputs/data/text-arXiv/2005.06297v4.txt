Abstract A pandemic caused by a new coronavirus has spread worldwide, affect-

ing Argentina. We implement an SEIR model to analyze the disease evolution in
Buenos Aires and neighbouring cities. The model parameters are calibrated using
the number of casualties officially reported. Since infinite solutions honour the
data, we show different cases. In all of them the reproduction ratio R0 decreases
after early lockdown, but then raises, probably due to an increase in contagion in
highly populated slums. Therefore it is mandatory to reverse this growing trend
in R0 by applying control strategies to avoid a high number of infectious and dead
individuals. The model provides an effective procedure to estimate epidemic parameters (fatality rate, transmission probability, infection and incubation periods)
and monitor control measures during the epidemic evolution.

1 Introduction

In March 9, 2020, the start of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic in Argentina was officially reported by the Argentinian Ministry of Health. By today,
June 24, 2020, the number of cases is still rising. The majority of mathematical
models that replicate illnesses outbreaks splits the population into compartments,
to analyze how much time will it take for one group to evolve into another [1,
2]. The mathematical details of these models can be seen in [1, 3, 4]. Here, we use
a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model, consisting of a system of
first-order ODEs to describe the spread of the virus, compute the number of infected individuals and estimate the death toll. As examples, the SEIR model has
been successfully applied to study the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis [5]
and varicella [6]. It is important to clarify that the E class is infected but has
not the symptoms of the disease, because they are incubating it. They will have
symptoms when they pass to class I. Individuals in class I may not have symptoms
(asymptomatic), but they are infectious, while those in class E are not. Moreover,
individuals in class E can move to R without showing symptoms, but they are
infectious when they are in class I.
The SEIR model has been applied by Carcione et al. [7] to simulate the epidemic in the Lombardy Region (Italy), with approximately 16500 casualties reported to date. The significant threat COVID-19 carries finds its meaning in the
elevated number of infected health-care workers, such as 20 % of the cases in Italy.
In order to analyze the epidemic’s behaviour, the model is calibrated using
the number of dead individuals to date, which we consider more reliable than

COVID-19 in Argentina

the number of infectious individuals. The model parameters are: probability of
transmission per contact, incubation and infectious periods and fatality rate.
Based on China, USA and European Unions experience, we are certain that
combining rapid diagnosis with isolation measures has a substantial effect on the
epidemics dynamics. Evaluating and quantifying the effectiveness of these methods
is extremely important [8] and numerical simulators contribute to achieve this
goal. Dekhordi et al. [9] presented a case study of COVID-19 using an statistical
analysis of data from countries in Asia and Europe like China, Italy and Spain,
among others, to characterize the dynamics of the pandemia.
Summarizing, the numerical simulation aim is to provide an effective procedure
to model the virus diffusion over time and to analyze the effectiveness of administrative measures. The ODES system solution is obtained employing a forward
Euler scheme [10] and we assume that natural deaths and births are balanced. In
this way the peak of infected and dead individuals per day as a function of time
can be predicted based on the parameters estimated during calibration.

2 The SEIR differential model

This work uses the SEIR epidemic model [1, 3, 4, 6, 11] to study the time evolution
of the COVID-19 epidemic in Argentina. The model considers a total (initial)
population, N0 , composed of four compartments: susceptible, S (t), exposed, E (t),
infected, I (t) and recovered, R(t), with t being the time variable.
The initial value problem for the SEIR ODE’s system is formulated as follows:
Ṡ = Λ − µS − βS

I
,
N

(1)

I
− (µ + )E,
N
I˙ = E − (γ + µ + α)I,
Ė = βS

Ṙ = γI − µR,

with initial conditions S (0), E (0), I (0) and R(0). In equation (1) the time derivative
is denoted by a dot above the variable and N is the number of live individuals at
time t, e.g. N = S + E + I + R ≤ N0 .
The coefficients in (1) are: the birth rate Λ, the natural per-capita death rate
µ, the virus induced average fatality rate α (its inverse is the life expectancy of

an individual in the infected class) and the probability of disease transmission
per contact β . Moreover, 1/γ and 1/ are the infection and incubation periods,
respectively. All of these coefficients have units of (1/time).

4

Juan E. Santos et al.

The traditional SIR model [12] is obtained selecting Λ = µ = 0 and  = ∞
while if Λ and µ are not zero, the model is termed endemic SIR [13]. However, as
the SIR model has no exposed compartment, then it would not be proper using it
for infections with  values such as those of the COVID-19.
Concerning the meaning of the variables in (1), S is the number of humans
susceptible to be exposed and E is the actual number of exposed individuals (individuals in which the disease is latent; they are infected but not infectious).
Individuals move from S to E depending on the number of contacts with I individuals, multiplied by the probability of infection (β ). Furthermore, exposed (E )
become infected (I ) with a rate  and infected become recovered (R) with a rate
γ . Since lifelong immunity is assumed, people in the R class do not move back to

the S class. Because of the relatively short period of the epidemic, it is assumed
that Λ = µN , so that the deaths balance the newborns.
The deceased individuals D(t) are computed as D(t) = N0 − N (t), therefore
the dead people per unit time Ḋ(t), can be obtained as [14]:
Ḋ(t) = αI (t).

(2)

if the deaths balance the newborns.
An important measure to quantify the virus expansion is the basic reproduction
ratio, R0 , which estimates the average number of secondary cases caused by an
already infected person. For the SEIR model, R0 is given by [15]
R0 =

β

( + µ)(γ + α + µ)

(3)

The basic reproduction ratio is used to estimate the virus spread, establishing
R0 = 1 as a stability limit: if R0 > 1 the disease invade the population while if
R0 < 1 the disease disappears. Al-Sheikh [16] analyzes in detail the behavior of

the SEIR models in terms of R0 .
Another measure is the infection fatality rate (IFR), defined as
IFR (%) = 100 ·

D∞
,
R∞ + D∞

(4)

where R∞ + D∞ represents the final number of infected individuals (t → ∞ refers
to the epidemics ending).
Using the last equation (1) (with µ = 0) and equation (2), we obtain
IFR (%) = 100 ·

α
,
α+γ

where this relation is always valid, not just at the epidemics ending.

(5)

COVID-19 in Argentina

A third usually reported (time-dependent) coefficient is the case fatality rate
(CFR), such that CFR > IFR, since this rate underestimates the number of infected individuals.
Equations (1) are discretized using a forward Euler discretization scheme with a
time step ∆t = 0.01 day. The discrete solution (S n , E n , I n , Rn ) = (S, E, I, R)(n∆t),
n ≥ 1 of this time discretization procedure yields positive and bounded solutions

[2]. Furthermore, the solution converges to an equilibrium, i.e., S n + Rn + Dn =
S∞ + R∞ + D∞ = N0 for t → ∞.

A sensitivity analysis of the model to changes in its parameters is presented
in [7], assuming that the parameters do not vary during the epidemic. It is observed that higher values of the incubation period (−1 ) delay the epidemic, and
increasing the infectious period (γ −1 ) induces the same effect. Furthermore, when
more individuals are initially exposed (E (0)), the intensity of the peak does not
change, but anticipates the epidemic. Other results indicate that if R0 does not
change during the epidemic, the peak of infected people is hardly sensitive to the
initial number of infected individuals, and an earlier lockdown highly reduces the
number of dead individuals.

3 The COVID-19 epidemic in the RMBA

Next, we attempt to model the COVID-19 epidemic in the RMBA, comprising the
city of Buenos Aires and neighbouring cities, with a population N0 = 14839026
individuals. For this purpose, we use as reliable data the total number of casualties
from day 1 (March 9, 2020) to day 108 (June 24). The reported infected people
cannot be used for calibration, since at present the number of asymptomatic,
undiagnosed infectious individuals is unknown. The number of death individuals is
also uncertain, since there can be an under-ascertainment of deaths, but the error
is much smaller than the error related to the infected individuals. The number
of dead individuals reported officially could possibly be underestimated due to
undeclared cases. Thus, we also consider a case with 100 % more dead people,
compared to the official figures.
Predictions of high accuracy are not possibly due to the lack of information
about the probability of the disease transmission, characteristics of the disease
and initial conditions of the SEIR model. We assume µ−1 = 3.6 × 10

−5

/ day,

corresponding to a life expectancy of 76 years. Parameter β varies as a piecewise
constant function in time intervals [t0 , t1 ], [t1 , t2 ] . . . [tL−1 , ∞], with changes
associated with administrative measures taken by the state (such as lockdown)

6

Juan E. Santos et al.

and behavior of the population. In this case, t0 = 1 day, t1 = 31 day and t2 =
50 day, i.e., L = 3, since after t1 (April 8), home isolation, social distancing and
partial Nation lockdown started to be effective, as indicated by an inflection point
in the curve of casualties, and after t2 (April 27), the situation became worst with
an increase in the slope of the curve.
The SEIR model parameters, α, β , , γ , together with the initial exposed individuals E (0) are estimated fitting the number of fatal victims. This constitutes
an inverse problem with infinite solutions. A Quasi Newton approximation technique for nonlinear least squares problem with the formula of Broyden-FletcherGoldfarb-Shanno is applied [17]. This technique was successfully applied to estimate parameters in reservoir engineering [18]. The L2 -norm of the differences
between simulated and measured casualties is minimized and yields E (0) and the
model parameters on each time interval. In fact, while α,  and γ remain constant
throughout the entire simulation, β varies in the intervals [t0 , t1 ], [t1 , t2 ] and [t2 ,
∞].

We show the results of five different cases that honour the data. The parameters
constraints, initial values and results for the five cases are displayed in Table
I. All the cases assume an initial number of infectious individual I (0) = 100,
although this value may also affect the result. The last column do not correspond
to variables but indicates the infected individuals at the end of the epidemic, i.e.,
I∞ = R∞ + D∞ , the day of the last infected individual (the end of the epidemic

in theory), and the death toll D∞ . The results are very sensitive to variations of
the parameter β , and consequently those of R0 , mostly due to the impact of the
performed intervention strategies. The tragic situation predicted by the model is
strongly influenced by the behaviour of R0 during the latter period, after day 50.
Therefore, a reduction of R0 is essential to avoid this situation.
Figure 1 and 2 show the fit and extended curves corresponding to Case 1, which
predicts an initial R0 = 3.34, decreasing to 0.95 in April 8, after the lockdown, and
increasing to 1.59 after April 27, most probably due to an increase of the contagion
in highly populated slums. This case, which is characterized by a long incubation
period of approximately 11 days, predicts an IFR = 1.92 % and a very high death
toll (nearly 179 K) and 9.4 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic.
However, this is due to the last R0 trend that can be inverted by implementing
more isolation. In fact, if the value of R0 = 0.95 had been maintained after April
27 only 1881 casualties and 92955 infected individuals would have occurred at
the end of the epidemic. In the situation shown in Case 1, the maximum number
of infected individuals is approximately 440000 people at day 287 (December 21,

COVID-19 in Argentina

7

2020). If only 1 % of these individuals require intensive care, this amounts to
4400 humans, a number that can overload the capacity of the hospitals. The other
cases honour the data with smaller incubation periods between 3.5 and 5 days,
and predict less than 1/2 of casualties, compared to Case 1, with IFR between
0.5 % and 1.15 % approximately. For instance, Case 2 (Figure 3) which predicts
an initial R0 = 1.90, decreasing to R0 = 1.02 (approximately the stability limit)
in April 8 , and increasing to 1.24 after April 27. Figure 3b shows a peak of 134
thousand infected individuals at 242 days (November 6, 2020), which implies 1340
patients if 1 % require intensive care, a more tractable amount. Figure 4 shows the
results of Case 2 but keeping R0 = 1.02 from day 31 (April 8). As can be seen, the
epidemic would be under control with a minimum death toll (6500 individuals) and
a minimum number of infected humans at the end of the epidemic (560 thousand
people). Also the maximum number of infected individuals is very low, nearly 2200
individuals at day 386 (March 30, 2021).
Since the reported number of deceased people could possibly be underestimated
due to undeclared cases, we also consider a case with 100 % more casualties to
date (Case 5 in Table I), giving IFR = 0.84 % and values of the other parameters
and infected and dead individuals similar to those of Cases 2, 3 and 4.
Data provided by literature can be compared with the values shown in Table I.
The population’s age affects the IFR and fatality rate. As an example an estimated
IFR of 0.657 % for the whole Chinese population grows to 3.28 for population over
60 yr age (Verity et al. [19] – Table I). If the amount of infected people is considerably superior than the reported cases, the mortality rate could be substantially
lower than the official one, indicating COVID-19 is less lethal than SARS and
MERS, despite of being far more contagious. Read et al. [20] states an average
value R0 = 4, whereas Wu et al. [21] get values within 1.8 and 2. As reported by
Chowell et al. [8] IFR = 4.8 % for SARS, and Verity et al. [19] state that CFR of
SARS is superior than the one of COVID-19, with approximately 1.38 %. Again,
COVID-19 appears to be far more contagious.
An extended approach consists in using time derivatives of fractional order to
generalize the diffusion process. Such models include in a natural way both memory and non-local effects [22, 23, 24, 25]. Indeed, replacing the first-order temporal
derivative by a Caputo fractional derivative of non-natural order [26] we obtain
a new parameter to adjust the data: the derivative order. This modelling can be
performed by using fractional derivatives computed with the Grünwald-Letnikov
approximation, which is a generalization of the finite-difference derivative [10, 27]
or solving the differential equations in the frequency domain [28, 29]. Furthermore,

8

Juan E. Santos et al.

the model can be made two-dimensional by including the spatial diffusion of the
virus [30, 31, 32] to model local outbreaks and be able to isolate them. The approach can be based on a finite-element method in the space-frequency domain
with domain decomposition. This numerical procedure has already been applied
to wave propagation in 2D and 3D media in geophysics [29]. Alternatively, the
Fourier pseudospectral method, to compute the spatial derivatives, combined with
time-domain fractional derivatives, can be used to solve the space-time diffusion
equation of the epidemic [10, 33]. Moreover, there are more complex versions of
the SEIR model as, for instance, including a quarantine class and a class of isolated (hospitalized) members [2]. Finally, since signals propagate instantaneously
in diffusion equations, the model predicts that there are more infectious humans
(I class) than actual before the latent period and at late stages of the epidemic.
Solutions to this problem can be found, for instance, in Keeling and Rohani [3] –
Section 3.3.

4 Conclusions

The SEIR epidemic model is implemented to simulate the time evolution of the
COVID-19 epidemic in Argentina, specifically the “Región Metropolitana de Buenos
Aires” (RMBA), where the situation is more critical compared to other parts of
the country. We calibrate the model parameters by using the number of officially
reported casualties, considered more reliable than the number of infected individuals. The simulation attempts to provide a simple but effective procedure to model
the virus diffusion over time, in view of the lack of knowledge of many variables
related to the epidemic.
At present, the epidemic in the Buenos Aires area is under control due to the
early lockdown, but we found that the reproduction ratio first decreased and then
increased, causing a drastic prediction of the death toll if this trend persist in the
future. In general, the incubation and infectious periods are in the range 4-5 days
and 3-4 days, respectively, and the infection fatality rate (IFR) between 0.5 % and
2 %. A case with an incubation period of 11 days yields approximately three times
more casualties at the end of the epidemic, and the infected individuals will be
between 4 million and 9 million people if the increasing R0 trend is not inverted.
We show how the effectiveness of the lockdown, the incubation and infectious
periods, the probability of transmission and the initially exposed individuals affect
the evolution of the epidemic. More complex models, i.e., with more classes or
compartments and considering spatial diffusion, can be used in the future when

some of the properties of the virus can be established more accurately, mainly the
incubation and infectious periods and fatality rate.

(∗) Doubling the number of casualties.
The values of β refer to the periods (in days): [1, 31], [31, 50] and [50, ∞] (in days).
I∞ indicates the total infected individuals at the end of the epidemic.
L, the day of the last infected individual is obtained when I < 1.
D∞ is the death toll at the end of the epidemic.
Read et al. [20] report the mean values −1 = 4 days and γ −1 = 3.6 days.
Lauer et al. [34] report −1 = 5.1 days.
Ferguson [35] estimate an average IFR = 0.9 %.

Figures 1a,1b: RMBA case history. Dead individuals (a) and number of deaths per day
(b), where the symbols dots represent the data. The solid line corresponds to Case 1 in Table
I.

Figures 2a,2b: Number of individuals (a) and deaths (b), corresponding to Case 1 in Table
I. In (b) the solid and dashed curves refer to the accumulated deaths and deaths per day. The
peak of infected individuals (and deaths per day) occurs at approximately day 287 (December
21, 2020).

Figures 3a,3b : Number of individuals (a) and deaths (b), corresponding to Case 2 in Table
I. In (b) the solid and dashed curves refer to the accumulated deaths and deaths per day. The
peak of infected individuals (and deaths per day) occurs at day 242 (November 6, 2020).

Figures 4a,4b: Number of individuals (a) and deaths (b), corresponding to Case 2 in Table
I, but maintaining the reproduction ratio R0 = 1.02 after day 31, i.e., β3 = β2 . In (b) the solid
and dashed curves refer to the accumulated deaths and deaths per day. The peak of infected
individuals (and deaths per day) occurs at day 386 (March 30, 2021).
