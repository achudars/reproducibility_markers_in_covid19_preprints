Abstract
This work introduces a novel epidemiological model that simultaneously considers
multiple viral strains, reinfections due to waning immunity response over time and
an optimal control formulation. This enables us to derive optimal mitigation strategies over a prescribed time horizon under a more realistic framework that does not
imply perennial immunity and a single strain, although these can also be derived as
particular cases of our formulation. The model also allows estimation of the number
of infections over time in the absence of mitigation strategies under any number of
viral strains. We validate our approach in the light of the COVID-19 epidemic and
present a number of experiments to shed light on the overall behaviour under one or

two strains in the absence of sufficient mitigation measures. We also derive optimal
control strategies for distinct mitigation costs and evaluate the effect of these costs
on the optimal mitigation measures over a two-year horizon. The results show that
relaxations in the mitigation measures cause a rapid increase in the number of cases,
which then demand more restrictive measures in the future.

Introduction

Also known as COVID-19, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is believed to have appeared at the end of 2019 in
Wuhan, China (Rodriguez-Morales et al., 2020). This new, highly transmissible virus spread rapidly around the world, causing significant loss of life and
possibly long-lasting economic consequences. The significance of the epidemic
prompted a large amount of literature and highlighted the need for comprehensive models combining epidemiology and decision support to help shape
public policy; see for example the influential work by Ferguson et al. (2020).
Many mathematical models and data analytic tools have been proposed to understand the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the world, generally based on classical epidemiological models (Bacaer, 2011; Kermack et al.,
1927). For example, Ferguson et al. (2020) promoted non-pharmaceutical interventions and Flaxman et al. (2020) evaluated the effect of such measures in
Europe. Later, Tarrataca et al. (2021) evaluated the effectiveness of long-term

on-off lock-down policies, whilst Kantner and Koprucki (2020) pursued optimal trade-offs between economics and healthcare concerns. Like most of the
literature, these works did not consider the possibility of reinfection or multiple
viral strains. Similarly, these possibilities were also disregarded in investigations of optimal strategies to exit lock-down which also did not consider the
possibility of multiple waves of infection (Rawson et al., 2020; Ruktanonchai
et al., 2020).
Also essential to shape public policy and prevention and treatment strategies is
a thorough understanding of the mechanism of the pandemic. This includes the
genomics mapping of viral strains (Callaway, 2020; Korber et al., 2020), which
when carried out in Brazil revealed more than 100 viral strains of COVID-19
(Resende et al., 2020; Vieira et al., 2021; Voloch et al., 2020), three of which
managed to survive. Such a reduction in genetic diversity has been attributed
to the social isolation measures in that country (Candido et al., 2020). Distinct
strains have also been recently identified in the United Kingdom (Kirby, 2021)
and South Africa (Tegally et al., 2020) which have rapidly spread around the
globe. Further studies are needed to properly assess the mortality rate of these
new variants, but the UK strain is already believed to be around 60 to 70%
more transmissible than the original variant.
Another important challenge to modellers is that the immune response to
COVID-19 is not uniform (Long et al., 2020), may reportedly wane over time
(Dan et al., 2021; Edridge et al., 2020; Seow et al., 2020) and reinfection is
possible (Bonifacio et al., 2020; Tillett et al., 2021). Furthermore, the same
patient may be infected by different strains of the virus (Nonaka et al., 2021;
To et al., 2020). Overbaugh (2020) argues that a thorough understanding of
reinfection is essential for understanding the spread of the disease, whereas
Dawood (2020) foretells future global challenges to contain epidemics with
reinfection. From a more operational standpoint, a recent work made use of
available databases and the classical SIR (susceptible, infected, recovered)
3

framework to estimate the number of COVID-19 reinfections from empirical
data (McMahon and Robb, 2020).

Although COVID-19 reinfection and multiple viral strains have received increased attention in the literature, mathematical modelling that incorporates
these characteristics is still scarce. Khyar and Allali (2020) searched for stability conditions within a general two-strain model and assessed the effect of
a quarantine strategy to curb COVID-19 spread in Morocco. More generally,
viral reinfection is often studied with emphasis on stability conditions and
disease-free equilibrium (e.g., Frid et al., 2003). In particular, Etbaigha et al.
(2018) proposed a SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infected, removed) model for
swine influenza and analysed the effect of prescribed vaccination strategies.
Finally, a simpler SIR model is employed in (Fudolig and Howard, 2020) to
study the dynamics of two viral strains considering that the second strain appears after the first strain reaches equilibrium. In general, whilst these models
examine long-term stability, they do not incorporate decision support tools
and optimisation.

To support decision making, optimal control approaches have been proposed
to promote compromises between COVID-19 infection levels and economic
consequences of non-pharmaceutical interventions (Bursac et al., 2020; Kantner and Koprucki, 2020; Perkins and España, 2020). The control mechanism
may consist of a proportional reduction in the infection levels (Kantner and
Koprucki, 2020; Perkins and España, 2020) or include quarantine, isolation
and public health education (Bursac et al., 2020). Even though these models do not account for reinfection and multiple viral strains, they do provide
interesting insights. Perhaps the most interesting insight is that high levels
of control are needed from the beginning to preserve healthcare systems and
leverage control options late in the epidemics (Perkins and España, 2020).
This is consistent with the empirical results in (Tarrataca et al., 2021).
4

Whereas models considering multiple viral strains are rare, one can still find
in the literature optimal control approaches based on classical epidemiological
models for two viral strains (Bentaleb et al., 2020; Gubar et al., 2017). These
are general epidemiological models, i.e. not specifically tailored for a given
epidemic, that do not consider reinfection. A limiting feature of the model
of Bentaleb et al. (2020), however, is that it relies on a curative treatment.
In contrast, the discrete network-based model of Gubar et al. (2017) relies on
individual control measures to be applied separately to each of the two strains.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to simultaneously consider
multiple viral strains, reinfection and optimal control. Amongst the novel contributions of this work, we generalise the preceding literature (Bentaleb et al.,
2020; Gubar et al., 2017; Khyar and Allali, 2020) by considering not only two
but any number of viral strains. Based on the SEIR framework, the model
innovates by accounting for the loss of immunity over time and contemplating
the possibility of reinfection, which has the potential to considerably increase
the infection levels over time. Finally, we propose a novel optimal control approach whereby a proportional reduction of the infection rate by mitigation
measures (such as non-pharmaceutical interventions) incurs an exponentially
increasing cost. We argue that this approach is more realistic than assuming
linear or quadratic costs (e.g., Bursac et al., 2020; Perkins and España, 2020),
once it has become clear that reduction in transmission is increasingly difficult
to obtain, and therefore increasingly more costly, once mitigating measures are
already in place. The proposed approach seeks for a compromise between the
overall number of deaths and the intervention costs over a prescribed horizon.
In addition to the methodological innovations, we also contribute by providing
a more realistic framework for epidemic modelling that avoids the sometimes
optimistic assumptions of perennial immunity and a single viral strain. The
framework also includes an optimal control formulation that enables the decision makers to clearly define the compromises between loss of life and economic
5

consequences over a prolonged time horizon.
The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces the
multi-strain model with reinfection and Section 3 analyses its equilibrium
points and the reproductive number. Section 4 proposes a novel optimal control formulation for the multi-strain model, which is solved to derive the optimal control strategy over a prescribed time horizon. Section 5 features a series
of experiments designed to illustrate the system’s behaviour in the presence of
one and two strains and with insufficient mitigation measures. Furthermore, it
also derives and interprets optimal control strategies over a two-year horizon
under distinct mitigation costs. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.

Proposed Mathematical Model

Let V = {1, . . . , n} be the set of virus strains circulating in the population,
and let j ∈ V denote a particular strain. For each j ∈ V and time t ≥ 0, let
Sj (t), Ej (t), Ij (t) and Rj (t), respectively denote the number of susceptible,
exposed, infected and removed (recovered and immune) individuals in the
population at time t. In addition, P (t) denotes the total population at time
t ≥ 0.
The susceptible population Sj (t) includes all individuals that are not immune
strain j ∈ V at time t ≥ 0 and therefore can catch the disease. In turn, Ej (t)
comprises all individuals that have been recently contaminated by strain j but
are currently in the latency period and therefore have not yet manifested the
disease and become infectious. Finally, Ij (t) counts all individuals that have
caught and manifested the strain j and are still suffering from it, whereas
Rj (t) denotes the total number of individuals that are recovered and immune
to strain j at time t.

Figure 1. Schematic diagram of the proposed model for two virus strains.

Consider the dynamics of a given strain j ∈ V . Observe from Eq. (3) that susceptible individuals can contract this strain when in contact with a contagious
carrier belonging to the infected population. The rate of infection is βj > 0
and u(t) ∈ [0, 1] emulates the lock-down effect at time t ≥ 0: u(t) = 1 indicates 100% effective mitigating measures and u(t) = 0 represents the absence
of non-pharmaceutical interventions, whereas u(t) ∈ (0, 1) indicates partially
effective measures to limit the spread of the disease. The first term in the right
7

hand side of (3) represents the formerly susceptible individuals that have just
been infected, whereas the second term indicates the exposed individuals that
have just manifested the once latent disease. The latter enter the infected
compartment in the right hand side of Eq. (4). The second term in the right
hand side of (4) represents infected individuals that recover - at rate γj > 0,
or die - at rate µj ≥ 0. Finally, each newly recovered individual moves to the
removed compartment - first term of the right hand side of (5). The second
term in the right hand side of (5) represents the loss of immunity over time.
Finally, Eq. (2) keeps track of the individuals that are currently susceptible to
strain j ∈ V , whereas Eq. (1) monitors the evolution of the total population
over time. Table 1 describes the system’s parameters.

The Equilibrium Points

To simplify our analysis, in this section we assume a constant control, i.e.
u(t) = u ∈ [0, 1], ∀t ≥ 0. A simple inspection to the system of equations
8

(1)-(5) yields

Hence, it is not hard to verify that the trivial equilibrium point is the infection
free point, with
Sj (∞) = S j ≥ 0,

Ej (∞) = Ij (∞) = Rj (∞) = 0,

P (∞) ≥ 0.

(7)

To calculate the non-trivial equilibrium, we start with the case of two strains
below.
Theorem 1 Suppose |V | = 2. Then, besides the trivial equilibrium point in
Eq. (7), the system has a non-trivial equilibrium point with I1 ≤ 0.
Proof Since |V | = 2, we have exactly two roots, one of which is the trivial
equilibrium. For the non-trivial equilibrium, we must have I1 6= 0 and I2 6= 0.
Hence, by equalling the left-hand side of (1)-(5) to zero, we obtain:
µ1 + γ1
µ2 + γ2

( 1 − u )β1
( 1 − u )β2

γ1 µ2 I 2
γ2 I 2
, R2 (∞) = R2 =
R1 (∞) = R1 = −
µ 1 δ1
δ2
S1 (∞) = S 1 =

Since all coefficients are positive, it follows that I 1 ≤ 0.
From Theorem 1, it follows that the non-trivial equilibrium point of a twostrain model is biologically infeasible, and therefore of no practical interest.
Theorem 2 below generalises this result for multiple strains, i.e. |V | > 2.
Theorem 2 Suppose |V | = n > 2. Then, besides the trivial equilibrium point
in Eq. (7), the system has a non-trivial equilibrium point with Ij ≤ 0, ∀j ∈
9

{1, . . . , n}.

Proof Making the left hand side of Eq. (4) equal to zero yields Ej =

µj +γj
Ij .
σj

Replacing this result in Eq. (3), we obtain:

0 = ( 1 − u )βj Sj Ij − σj Ej = ( 1 − u )βj Sj Ij − (µj + γj )Ij
0 = Ij (( 1 − u )βj Sj − (µj + γj )) .

Therefore, either Ij = 0 or Sj =

µj +γj
.
( 1−u )βj

Now, substituting the latter equality

in (6) and making the derivative nil, we have:

0 = −( 1 − u )βj Sj Ij + δj Rj −

eq. (5) =⇒ 0 =

Since µj > 0 ∀j, for the last equality to hold we must have either Ij = 0, j =
0, 1 . . . n, or Ij < 0 for at least one j ∈ {1, . . . , n}.

Theorem 2 therefore implies that the non-trivial equilibrium point is biologically infeasible and of no practical use for any number of different strains. In
the remainder of this paper, we will only consider biologically feasible solutions.

3.1

Stability

Considering that only the trivial equilibrium points are of biological interest,
this section analyses the stability solely with respect to these points. The
system (1)-(5) has a dimension 4 × n + 1. Consequently, the Jacobian matrix
associated with the system and applied to the trivial equilibrium is of order
(4 × n + 1)2 . It has n + 1 null eigenvalues and n eigenvalues equal to −δj , j =
1, ..., n. The remaining 2 × n eigenvalues are given by:
−1/2(µj + γj + σj ) + 1/2

q

4 ( 1 − u ) βj σj S j + (µj + γj − σj )2 ,

−1/2(µj + γj + σj ) − 1/2

q

4 ( 1 − u ) βj σj S j + (µj + γj − σj )2 .

To prove stability we need to show that the real part of the eigenvalues are
negative. Therefore, it suffices to show that
q

−1/2(µj + γj + σj ) + 1/2 4 ( 1 − u ) βj σj S j + (µj + γj − σj )2 < 0,
since this implies that the remaining eigenvalues will also be negative. The
expression above holds if:
q

4 ( 1 − u ) βj σj S j + (µj + γj − σj )2 < (µj + γj + σj ),

4 ( 1 − u ) βj σj S j + (µj + γj − σj )2 < (µj + γj + σj )2 ,
4 ( 1 − u ) βj σj S j + (µj + γj − σj )2 < (µj + γj + σj )2 ,
( 1 − u ) βj S j < (µj + γj ).
From the latter inequality, we can define the reproduction number,
( 1 − u ) βj S j
.
j=1,...,n
µj + γj

R0 = max

(8)

We can say that the trivial equilibrium point (without infection) is locally
asymptotically stable if R0 < 1. Hence, Eq. (8) implies a minimum level of
11

constant lock-down effect u ∈ [0, 1] to stabilise the system. Observe that,
since the lock-down effect applies to all viral strains, it suffices to stabilise the
system with respect to the most transmissible strain.
In the next section, we expand the analysis to search for time varying lockdown effects with a view to optimising the long-term cost of non-pharmaceutical
(lock-down) interventions.

4

Optimal Lock-down Strategies

To control the spread of the disease in the population, the proposed strategy
considers an isolation level of the population u(t), t ≥ 0 at any time t. To
account for the time-varying control, let us rewrite the system of equations
(1)-(6) as follows:
Ṗ (t) = −

n
X

µj Ij

(9)

j=1

S˙j (t) = −(1 − u(t))βj Sj (t)Ij (t) + δj Rj (t) −

n
X

µi Ii

(10)

i=1;i6=j

Ėj (t) = (1 − u(t))βj Sj (t)Ij (t) − σj Ej (t),

(11)

I˙j (t) = σj Ej (t) − (µj + γj )Ij (t),

(12)

Ṙj (t) = γj Ij (t) − δj Rj (t),

(13)

To find a meaningful trade-off between the cost of the control, i.e. lock-down
measures or non-pharmaceutical interventions, and the cost of elevated infection levels to the healthcare system and the population in general, we define
the following functional cost:
J(P, u) = c1 P − ec2 u , 0 ≤ u ≤ 1,
where c1 > 0 and c2 > 0 are scalar parameters.

12

(14)

Recall that in the revised formulation Eq. (9)-(13), u(t) = 0 indicates no lockdown and u(t) = 1 corresponds to full lock-down. Observe that the cost in
(14) grows with the population size and decreases as a function of the control
u. While increasing u decreases the functional, it also implies a decrease in
the number of infections and, therefore, deaths. And less deaths imply in an
increased total population, thus increasing the functional. Observe also that
the cost of control increases exponentially in the feasible interval [0, 1], to
mimic the fact that extra mitigation measures tend to become increasingly
costly.
Let ψ = {u(t), t ∈ (0, T ) : u(t) ∈ [0, 1]} be a feasible lockdown strategy and
let Ψ denote the set of all feasible strategies. For each control strategy ψ ∈ Ψ,
let
J(ψ) =

Z T

J(P (s), u(s)) ds

(15)

0

denote the overall cost of the strategy. The optimal control problem then
becomes:
Maximise J(ψ), ψ ∈ Ψ
(16)
subject to (9) − (13).

The overall objective in (16) is to minimise the number of deaths over time,
which is equivalent to maximising the population, whilst also accounting for
the cost of lock-down measures represented by the negative term in (14).

4.1

Solution of the Optimal Control Problem

The solve (16), we make use of Pontryagin’s maximum principe (Bryson and
Ho, 1970; Kirk, 1970; Pontryagin et al., 1962). Firstly, we need to formulate
13

In the above equation, φP represents the co-state variable corresponding to the
original variable P ; similarly, the subscript of the remaining co-state variables
φ indicates the corresponding original variable. In addition, η ≥ 0 is a penalty
multiplier added to ensure that u ≥ 0; at optimality we must have ηu∗ = 0.
By deriving the Hamiltonian with respect to the original variables in (9)-(13),
we obtain adjoint system of equations with respect to the co-state variables:

Numerical Experiments

In order to better understand the long-term behaviour of the system (1)-(5),
we performed a simple experiment with a single virus strain, which we will
call Experiment 1. The parameters for this experiment are based on (Tarrataca
et al., 2021) and appear in Table 2 below. Note that Experiment 1 does not
consider any lock-down effect, which means that u(t) = 0, ∀t ≥ 0.

population P (0) in this and all the remaining figures. Notice that the shares
of susceptible, exposed, infected and removed (currently immune) individuals
reach a sort of long-term equilibrium. For the specific parameters, the percentage of susceptible individuals stabilises just short of 10%, whereas around
5% of the individuals will be exposed - i.e. in the latency period - in the
equilibrium. Furthermore, the level of infection in equilibrium is around 15%,
whereas around 60% of the population will be intermittently immune to the
virus in the long-term. Notice also that the number of deaths continues to
increase over time.
We speculate that the level upon which the removed population stabilises in

Figure 2 provides some insight into the required levels of herd immunity for a
given virus strain. In addition, the percentage of the population that is infected
in the long-term, in the example around 15% of the population at any given
time, provides an insight into the burden of the epidemic on the health system.
This level, coupled with the estimated number of cumulative deaths, may be
used to inform healthcare policies in the long-term. Whereas the percentage
of cumulative deaths is not to be viewed as an attempt to estimate such a
level, given the uncertainty in the parameters and their variation around the
world, it is provided here to offer some insights into the cumulative effect of
the epidemic in the overall health of the population.
Figure 3 illustrates the results for two viral strains (Experiment 2 ), with the
second appearing 180 days after the first. By second strain here we mean the
first virus mutation that is sufficiently distinct as to not be affected by antibodies from previous strain. In this experiment, we assume that the parameters
of the second strain are similar to those of the first.
Considering that the two strains are similar, the result in Figure 3 is quite
intuitive. We observe that the second strain is simply a delayed version of the
first outbreak, which makes sense given the similar parameters. The important
feature here is that the second strain will add to the burden on the healthcare
17

system, thereby increasing the levels of contamination and eventually doubling
the burden. Notice, however, that at the peak of the second strain, most of
the infections will be from this strain before the system eventually stabilises.
Observe also the significant reduction of the population, which evinces a significant increase in deaths with respect to the single strain results. We argue
that this should be considered to inform the decision makers. Indeed, strategies to prevent different strains from entering a given territory by enforcing
testing upon arrival can be an important part of mitigation policies.

Inspired by the second strain reported in Britain, which is believe to be up to
70% more transmissible than the first strain, the third experiment (Experiment
3 ) replicates Experiment 2, but considering a more transmissible second strain,
with β2 = 1.7β1 . Figure 4 depicts the results. One can notice that, as the
second strain peaks, most of the new infections will be caused by this strain.
As expected, one can also notice higher levels of mortality for the second
strain, and a higher level of overall transmission of this strain as the system
stabilises.

Optimal mitigation strategies

This section provides insights into the effect of the optimal control policy
derived in Theorem 3 into the dynamics of the system over a two-year horizon.
To simplify the results and facilitate the interpretation, we introduce a series of
experiments with a single viral strain. This relies on the results of Section 3.1
and Eq. (8), which show that a control able to stabilise the most transmissible
strain will also stabilise the remaining strains. Hence, an optimal policy derived
for the single most transmissible strain can also be relied upon to stabilise the
remaining strains.
We consider six sets of cost parameters c1 and c2 for the functional in Eq. (14)
in the current experiment, which is labeled Experiment 4. The parameters are
described below:

Cases A to F emulate a sequence of decreasing costs of mitigation measures, to
19

provide an insight into the change in the optimal control as a function of such
decrease. In Figure 5, which depicts the results for Case A, one can notice that
the optimal control stabilises around mitigating measures with a reduction of
50% in transmission. After approximately four months the measures are slowly
relaxed to yield a 37.5% mitigation that produces a surge in infections. To
respond to this surge, the mitigation is then restored to about 40% and this
level is decreased very slowly in the remaining horizon as the system stabilises.

Figure 5. Optimal control policy for Case A

Case B introduces a small decrease in the cost of mitigation measures and one
can see in Figure 6 that this results in an increase in the mitigation measures.
It is also noteworthy that the overall behaviour of the mitigation measures
u(t) follows the same pattern as in the previous experiment.
We also observe the same trends and overall behaviour of the mitigation measures in Cases C and D, see Figures 7-8. However, as c2 is decreased, we observe
higher levels of mitigation measures over time. In addition, we can also observe
that the relaxation of the mitigation measures is delayed with the increase of
c2 .
When the cost of mitigation is sufficiently decreased, we observe that the
mitigation measures tend to stabilise at a given level over the entire planning

horizon. This happens in Cases E and F, depicted in Figures 9 and 10 below.
The difference in these cases is that the mitigation levels stabilise around 80%
for Case E, while reaching around 88% in Case F.
To sum up, the results illustrate the sensitivity of the model with respect to
the perceived costs of mitigation measures. It is clear that different parameters
may lead to highly distinct levels of infection and, consequently, overall deaths.
Furthermore, in line with the results in (Perkins and España, 2020), we observe
that large levels of control are needed from the outset to contain the infection

levels and, therefore, preserve a wide range of feasible control measures as time
elapses. On the other hand, if control measures are delayed, the burden on the
healthcare system grows so rapidly that the decision makers may be left with
no option but a full lock-down to curb the infection levels (Tarrataca et al.,
2021).

Concluding Remarks

This paper proposed a novel modelling framework based on the classical SEIR
model that considers multiple viral strains, reinfections and optimal control.
We validated the framework in the light of the COVID-19 epidemic. The
results are interpretable, robust and highlight a very intuitive result, namely
that it is possible to contain the epidemic by focusing on the most transmissible
strain.
The results show that, in the absence of mitigating measures, an epidemic with
a single viral strain and reinfection will reach an equilibrium after the peak
of infections. Whilst real-world data suggest that the peak is not manageable
by any healthcare system in the world, it is evident that even the equilibrium
may imply levels of infection that will challenge healthcare resources in many
regions of the world.
The results also suggest that, with insufficient mitigation measures, an epidemic with a second wave includes a second peak of infections that is higher
than the first if the second strain is as transmissible as the first; this is because
the second peak combines infections from both strains. Moreover, the number of deaths increases considerably in the presence of the second strain. In
23

view of the second COVID-19 strain in the UK, we also simulated a scenario
where the second strain is 70% more transmissible than the first. This causes
a larger and sharper peak in the second wave, in which the majority of cases
will belong to the second strain not just because it is more transmissible, but
also because it peaks when the first strain had already stabilised. The results
are consistent with the reports of the second strain in the UK and in the state
of Amazonas, Brazil, where the second wave caused an explosive increase in
new cases, as well as a complete depletion of healthcare resources.
Finally, we propose and solve an optimal control problem to derive optimal
mitigation measures whilst considering that the cost of mitigation measures
grows exponentially as a function of the mitigation effort. Because controlling
the single most transmissible strain suffices, we derived optimal control strategies for a single strain to facilitate the interpretation of the results. Consistently with previous literature, our findings suggest that an early relaxation of
lockdown measures causes a sharp increase in the number of new cases which,
in turn, will lead to the need for more restrictive measures. As expected,
the optimal levels of isolation are very sensitive to the mitigation costs, with
lower costs resulting in higher levels of restrictive measures. Furthermore, only
persistently high levels of mitigation measures are capable of containing the
epidemic in the long-term, which suggests that an efficient deployment of mass
vaccination is the single most effective way out of the current epidemic.
