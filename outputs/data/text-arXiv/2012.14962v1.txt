The Impact of Corona Populism: Empirical Evidence from Austria and Theory
Patrick Mellacher1
Abstract: I study the impact of corona populism – politics aimed at denying or downplaying
the danger posed by COVID-19 for strategic reasons – on the evolution of the pandemic using
regional data from Austria. The right-wing FPÖ first vocalized strong support for strict
lockdown measures, but made a corona populist turn at the end of the first wave of infections.
Using regression analysis, I show that the vote share of the FPÖ at the last national
parliamentary elections is a strong predictor for the number of COVID-19 deaths after the FPÖ
switched their policy stance, while there is no or even a negative correlation before the policy
switch. These results are robust under simple as well as sophisticated specifications of the
model controlling for demographic and socioeconomic conditions. Interestingly, I do not find
a statistically significant correlation between the FPÖ vote share and the reported number of
infections. I hypothesize that this can be traced back to a self-selection bias in testing. To
explore this hypothesis, I extend the classical SIRD model to incorporate conditional
quarantine and two groups of agents: the majority and the corona sceptics, where the latter
are less inclined to get tested and engage in social distancing. Such a model can explain the
nontrivial empirics: if mixing is sufficiently homophilic, an increase in the share of corona
sceptics can cause an increase in the number of deaths without increasing the number of
reported infections. I finally discuss the implications for both groups.

Introduction
Following Acemoglu et al. (2013) and applying it to the case of the corona pandemic, populism
can be defined as an anti-elitist view that receives significant support, but ultimately has
adverse effects for the majority of the population.2 Situations in which costs are mainly
external and/or difficult to comprehend seem to be particularly susceptible to such populism.
This is neither news for scholars who study views on (policies against) climate change, nor for

definition of populism.

epidemiologists who witness seemingly ever-growing doubt against vaccines, e.g. in the case
of the measles.
The Covid-19 pandemic, however, put a spotlight on these views as an imminent danger for
society, as health care systems around the world are on the brink of collapse and must rely on
more or less voluntary social distancing. Corona populism is, more succinctly, politics aimed
at downplaying the threat of COVID-19. If the level of support for such populist views is too
high, a democracy has difficulties to implement policies that internalize these externalities
effectively – witness the yellow vest protests against the carbon tax in France and e.g. the
protests of the “corona rebels” in Germany. Unfortunately, relying on individual responsibility
to reduce the level of negative externalities seems to be particularly hopeless in such
situations.
We can hypothesize that a) supporters of political parties which adopted corona populism are
more likely to underestimate the threat posed by COVID-19, as experimental evidence
suggests that voters are more likely to follow of their own party (Grewenig et al. 2020), and b)
that these beliefs translate into behavioral differences between supporters of corona populist
parties and the rest of the population, i.e. lower compliance with containment measures and
social distancing as shown by e.g. .. If this is true, the support for corona populist parties in a
given community can predict the size of the COVID-19 outbreak.
In this paper, I study whether the policy stance of the Austrian right-wing populist freedom
party (FPÖ) had an effect on the evolution of the pandemic in communities in which they can
rely on a larger voter base. The FPÖ and were the first to demand that drastic measures should
be taken against COVID-19. By the end of April, however, the FPÖ made a U-turn and
demanded to “end the Corona madness” (APA OTS 2020a) by which they meant the
containment measures taken by the government. In the end of November 2020, one
representative of the party even went so far as to advise people not to participate in a mass
testing program announced by the Austrian government to be held before Christmas because
testing positive would mean that you would have to spend Christmas home alone (APA OTS
2020b).
Previous research on the effects of political polarization and populism on beliefs, behavior,
and public health outcomes during the pandemic have mainly concentrated on the US. Allcott

et al. (2020) show using mobile phone data on the county level that democratic counties
exercise more social distancing than republican counties (also confirmed by e.g. Baradaran
Motie and Biolsi 2020), but also record more cases and deaths per capita. Controlling for a
large number of covariates, Gollwitzer et al. (2020) however find that Trump-leaning counties
do not only exercise less social distancing, but that this is also linked to higher growth rates in
the number of cases and fatalities.
Allcott et al. (2020) also confirm that individual beliefs about the severity Covid-19 are linked
to self-reported social distancing using data from an online survey with US participants.
Further investigating what drives these differences, Fan et al. (2020) document using data
from an online survey that there are partisan differences in social distancing behavior and
beliefs, which also depend on differences in news consumption.
Bisbee and Lee (2020) show that Republican-leaning counties were more likely to practice
social distancing when Trump voiced emphasized the risks of Covid-19 on his Twitter profile.
As seen in their analysis, however, Trump sent at best a mixed message about the severity of
Covid-19. Barbieri and Bonini (2020) show that a higher vote share for the Italian right-wing
party Lega is associated with lower social distancing using regional mobility data. Like Trump’s
course, the Lega’s policy was with a zig-zag: first downplaying the pandemic, then agreeing to
a lockdown, followed by a call for a fast re-opening.
The main contribution of this paper is twofold:
First, I contribute to the literature on the causes and effects of behavioral differences in the
pandemic (e.g. Allcott et al. (2020), Fan et al. (2020) and Gollwitzer et al. (2020)). I show that
the number of deaths is positively correlated with the vote share of the Austrian FPÖ using
district-level data after the FPÖ started to advocate against lockdown measures. This finding
holds in both simple and sophisticated specifications of a standard OLS model. The case of the
FPÖ is particularly interesting on its own due to the party’s long tradition and its clear policy
stance subject to a U-turn at the end of the first wave of infections. More importantly, a
pattern emerges that is not visible in countries like the US: Although the FPÖ vote share is
strongly correlated with the number of deaths, it is not significantly correlated with the
number of reported infections after the first wave of infections.

Second, I contribute to the literature on the implications of heterogeneous behavior and
heterogeneous mixing on the evolution of the pandemic (e.g. ). I extend the classical SIRD
model (Kermack and McKendrick 1927) to explain the distinct Austrian pattern regarding cases
and deaths. My model is populated with two types of agents, who behave differently: the
corona sceptics and the majority. Corona sceptics practice less social distancing, are less
inclined to get tested once they develop symptoms than the majority, and mixing between
the two types of agents is more or less homophilic, i.e. corona sceptics are more likely to
interact with other corona sceptics than with the majority or not. I show that such a model
can explain the Austrian pattern, if mixing is sufficiently homophilic and explore the
implications of behavioral differences, group sizes, the degree of homophily on public health
outcomes of the two groups, as well as the total population.

Empirics
Data & Method
In order to investigate, whether the policy stance of the FPÖ had an effect on the evolution of
the pandemic in Austria, I draw on district-level data on the number of infections and deaths,
which are available for a daily basis (BMSGPK 2020). Studying county-level data is a standard
approach followed by e.g. Allcott et al. (2020), Fan et al. (2020) and Gollwitzer et al. (2020) to
study the impact of polarization on the spread of the virus in the US and districts are the
Austrian counterpart for counties.
To get a first graphical intuition of the evolution of the pandemic in communities with a low
or a high FPÖ vote share, I split the time series dataset into two groups, one for districts with
a FPÖ vote share below or equal to and one above the median share of this party. Figure 1
shows a local regression (loess) of the cumulated number of infections per 1,000 inhabitants
and deaths per 100,000 inhabitants over time. This exercise suggests that districts, in which
the FPÖ fared relatively well at the last national elections received relatively little damage in
the first wave of infections, reporting lower numbers of cases and deaths. In the infection
wave in autumn 2020, however, the cumulated death toll in these districts surpasses the total
number of deaths in the other districts, indicating that the second wave hit districts with a
high FPÖ vote share much harder. We do not observe the same clear trend in the cumulative
p. 4 / 28

The Impact of Corona Populism

Patrick Mellacher

number of cases per capita, as districts with a low FPÖ vote share continued to have more
cumulative cases (see fig. 1).

In order to confirm whether this graphical intuition is also statistically significant when
controlling for other district-specific characteristics which may drive this pattern like e.g. the
age structure of the population, I then merged the daily data to create two cross-sectional
datasets: one covering the number of reported infections and deaths before, and one after
the FPÖ-policy switch for each district. When doing so, the time lag between a social
interaction causing an infection, the onset of symptoms, the reporting of the test result and
eventual death has to be considered. Therefore, the launch of the FPÖ campaign against the
containment measures on the 27th of April cannot have had an immediate impact on cases or
deaths. I thus chose the 11th of May as a cut-off-date to split the two cross-sectional datasets.
However, the main findings are insensitive to reasonable changes in the cutoff-date and thus
also hold if we chose e.g. the 27th of April instead.
I then merged the cross-sectional dataset with data on the results of the last national elections
on the district level as a proxy for the influence of the FPÖ. To control for various other
socioeconomic and demographic factors that could influence the evolution of the pandemic,
I also merged these datasets with district-level data on population density (Statistik Austria
2020a), age composition and nationality (Statistik Austria 2020b), gross wages, employment
status, education and the number of commuters (WKO 2020).
The following two subsections present the results of separate OLS regressions on the number
of cases per 1k and deaths per 100k inhabitants on each of the cross-sectional datasets.

Before the policy-switch
Table 1 shows the results of OLS regressions on the number of deaths per 100,000 inhabitants
before the policy switch. It shows that there is mixed evidence of the effect of support for the
FPÖ on the number of deaths per capita before the policy switch, as there is no statistically
significant effect in the models with the best fit. The control variables show that districts in
which there are more employees and in which employees earned less on average in 2018 had
to mourn more deaths, which points to low-paid employees having more troubles to practice
social distancing. The share of the population born in Austria also has a significant positive
effect, i.e. a higher share of Austrian-born predicts a higher number of deaths. The exact
reason for this is unclear, although cultural differences in social distancing, as well as the
spread of the disease via networks in which there are few inter-cultural connections possibly
explain this pattern.

For the number of cases, however, all models predict a highly significant negative impact of
the vote share of the FPÖ on the number of cases, i.e. those districts in which the FPÖ fared
better, experienced a lower number of reported infections during the first wave. The models
also confirm the relationships observed in Table 1 regarding the share of employees, the share
of Austrian-born and the mean gross income . Also, some models predict a statistically
significant positive relationship between unemployment in January 2020 and the number of
cases, i.e. a higher rate of unemployment predicts more reported cases.

This analysis suggests that the pro-lockdown policy of the FPÖ during the first wave of
infections indeed had a positive effect on public health outcomes in those districts in which
they can rely on a large base of support.

After the policy-switch
The analysis of case and deaths after the policy switch shows that the control variables have
to be adapted, i.e. the relevant factors at play during the first wave are different from the
second wave. Importantly, the role of the FPÖ vote share plays a completely opposite role and
is associated with a strong increase in deaths, if the FPÖ is stronger. It is notable that a
regression involving solely the FPÖ vote share already explains 21.5% of the variance in
observed deaths. Only education and nationality are statistically significant control variables:

Deaths are predicted to be higher, if a higher share of the population has completed at most
compulsory education, and lower, if a higher share of the population is born in Turkey. While
we can hypothesize that the first result may to a certain degree also be explained with corona
scepticism, the result regarding Turkish-born population may hint to a lower spread of the
virus in Turkish communities or to the fact that the Turkish community is better able to protect
their elders from the virus. In any case, it is an unexpected result as Turkish weddings were
prominently featured and discussed in the media as superspreader events (e.g. Wiener
Zeitung 2020).

If we look at the number of reported infections (i.e. cases), however, we do not find a
statistically significant relationship with the FPÖ vote share (see table 4). Statistically
significant control variables are the share of population above 64 years, which predicts a
decrease in reported infections (in line with the expected behavioral response), the share of
unemployed and the gross income, which also predict a decrease (both possibly due to
enhanced social distancing capabilities). In certain models, the share of population born in
Austria predicts an increase in the number of reported infections.

The fact that the vote share of the FPÖ is strongly correlated with deaths, but not with cases
seems at first glance to be paradox and to sow doubt on the hypothesis that the corona
populist turn of the FPÖ contributed to the spread of the virus.
However, Covid tests are usually conducted on individuals who self-report their symptoms or
who are named as being close contacts. Thus, they are in one way or another voluntary, which
means that there may be a self-selection bias. We can hypothesize that people who
underestimate the virus (the “corona sceptics”) are less likely to report an infection and to
name contacts. In this case, the number of deaths per infection in such communities would
be higher. In order to test this hypothesis, table 5 presents OLS regressions on deaths including
the number of reported cases as control variable. It shows that the negative effect of the FPÖ
vote share on the number of deaths persist, i.e. communities in which the FPÖ is strong indeed
have a higher number of deaths per infection. Looking at the control variables, we find a
statistically significant negative correlation with the share of population born in Turkey. This
points to the hypothesis that Turkish communities are indeed more apt at shielding their

elders from the virus. Some models predict a statistically significant positive relationship with
the share of population at or above 65 (in line with the expectation that this group has a higher
risk of dying) and the share of population which completed at most compulsory education
(again, in line with the hypothesis about corona scepticism).

Theory
In order to explore the idea of the self-selection bias and to investigate, whether and under
which conditions it can produce the pattern observed in a formal context, I extend the classical
SIRD model (Kermack and McKendrick 1927) in a twofold way:
1.) I include a quarantined compartment that includes only detected cases denoted with
Q. A certain fraction of infected are assumed to test themselves upon infection and
are then quarantined, i.e. their social contacts are set to 0. I assume that all critical
cases are detected, since they seek medical attention and get tested for showing
symptoms of Covid-19. Followingly, only people in the quarantine compartment may
die. The fraction of quarantined which eventually dies depends on the fraction of noncritical cases who opt to get tested voluntarily, i.e. on the fraction of critical cases in
the quarantine compartment.
2.) I split the compartments governing the susceptible, the infected and the quarantined
to incorporate two different groups: a low-compliant group (the corona sceptics) and
a high-compliant group (the majority). I consider differences in a) social distancing, and
b) propensity to get tested. I also consider the case of homophilic mixing, i.e. that
individuals of a certain group are more likely to get into contact with members of their
own group than members of the other group (which is why I need two different
compartments for the infected).

p. 13 / 28

Figure 1: Depiction of the compartments

In setting up the laws of motion between the different compartments, I largely follow the
preferred mixing model described by Brauer (2008).3 In contrast to models such as the
homophilic mixing model proposed by Ellison (2020), the model used in my paper is able to
replicate the standard homogenous mixing model as a special case using the same basic
reproduction numbers (𝑅01 and 𝑅02 respectively). The laws of motion between the different
compartments are given as follows, where 𝑆𝑖 denotes the susceptibles of group i, 𝐼𝑖 the
infectious, 𝑄𝑖 the quarantined, 𝑁𝑖 the size of group I at period 0, 𝛽𝑖𝑗 the number of infectious
contacts from a member of group j to a member of group i, ℎ the homophily of social contacts,
1

𝛼𝑖 the propensity to get tested, 𝑅0𝑖 the basic reproduction number of group i, the duration
𝛾

the illness, and 𝜇𝑖 the fraction of detected cases who eventually die:
𝑆𝑖̇ (𝑡) = −𝑆𝑖 (𝑡)𝛽𝑖 (𝑝𝑖1

𝐼1 (𝑡)
𝐼2 (𝑡)
)
+ 𝑝𝑖2
𝑁1
𝑁2

Brauer (2008) considers the fraction that each group currently makes up as part of the total population. I
refrained from implementing this logic in order to retain the classical SIRD outcome as a special case.

In order to better disentangle the effects of behavioral differences of the two groups, I make
the following practical assumption: Individuals of both groups are equally likely to die as a
result of an infection with a probability of 𝜋. We can thus set the probability that a quarantined
𝜋

person dies at 𝜇𝑖 = 𝛼 and set a lower boundary for 𝛼𝑖 , as I assumed previously that at least
𝑖

all critical cases are tested, i.e. 𝛼𝑖 ≥ 𝜋.

Homogenous mixing
Let us first consider the case of homogenous mixing, i.e. ℎ = 0 and 𝑅0 = 𝑅01 = 𝑅02 . In this
case, we can immediately see that 𝑝𝑖𝑗 = 𝑝𝑖 = 𝑁

𝑁𝑖

1 +𝑁2

. Thus, if we normalize the population to

1, i.e. 𝑁1 + 𝑁2 = 1, the dynamic governing the susceptibles collapses to the dynamic of the
classical one-group SIR framework, i.e.:
𝑆𝑖̇ (𝑡) = −𝑆𝑖 (𝑡)𝛾𝑅0 (𝐼1 (𝑡) + 𝐼2 (𝑡))

p. 15 / 28

The Impact of Corona Populism

Patrick Mellacher

In such a case, differentiating between two infectious compartments is unnecessary.
Nevertheless, we could consider differences in the propensity to get tested (and subsequently
get quarantined), i.e. a different evolution of 𝑄1 and 𝑄2 . From the above formula follows easily
that such a difference can only affect both groups equally (relative to their share of total
population) in terms of deaths or the sum of infected and quarantined, as the relative share
of 𝐼𝑖 does not have an impact on the evolution of 𝑆𝑖 .
Setting 𝑆1 = 𝑆2 = 0.4995, 𝐼1 = 𝐼2 = 0.0005, 𝑅0 = 2.5, 𝜋 = 0.01 and 𝛼1 = 0.01 and varying
𝛼2 , we find that the detection rate has a large impact on “flattening the curve”, but also on
reducing the cumulative number of infected (see figure 2).

Figure 2: Evolution of total infected including quarantined (left) and total susceptibles (right).

Proportionate mixing
As soon as the two subpopulations engage in different activity patterns, i.e. 𝑅01 ≠ 𝑅02 ,
homogenous mixing is implausible. If, for instance, group 1 only has one infectious contact per
day, whereas group 2 has five, members of group 2 cannot on average have 2.5 infectious
contacts with members of group 1, if the two groups are equal-sized. The specification by
Brauer (2008), which provides the basis of my model, accounts for this. If activity patterns
differ, but mixing is not homophilic, it is proportionate, i.e. members of a specific group meet
members of another specific group according to their relative population shares and basic
reproduction numbers as specified above. As a result, outcomes for both groups cannot be
used interchangeably anymore and can be disaggregated in a meaningful way. Figure 3 shows
that an increase in 𝑅0𝑖 ceteris paribus makes both groups worse off. In contrast to a decrease
p. 16 / 28

The Impact of Corona Populism

Patrick Mellacher

in the detection rate, however, group i is more affected by such an increase than the other
group. The simulations are here initialized with 𝑆1 = 𝑆2 = 0.4995, 𝐼1 = 𝐼2 = 0.0005, 𝑅01 =
1, 𝜋 = 0.01 and 𝛼1 = 𝛼2 = 0.01, varying 𝑅02 :

Figure 3: Susceptibles and infected for varying 𝑅02 under proportionate mixing

Nevertheless, such a setup is also unable to fully explain the Austrian empirics. As fig. 4 shows,
a situation in which reported infections are higher in the population that is composed of 20%
corona sceptics compared to one with 50% corona sceptics is temporarily possible. However,
the opposite relationship regarding the number of deaths cannot be observed. Furthermore,
the correlation regarding the number of reported infections quickly gets overturned. These
results are produced with the following initialization:
Population 1: ( 𝑆2 = 0.4995, 𝐼2 = 0.0005, 𝑆1 = 0.4995, 𝐼1 = 0.0005 and population 2: (𝑆2 =
0.1998, 𝐼 = 0.0002, 𝑆1 = 0.7992, 𝐼1 = 0.0008). Both runs are parametrized with 𝑅01 = 1
p. 17 / 28

The Impact of Corona Populism

Patrick Mellacher

and 𝑅02 = 2, 𝛼1 = 0.01 and 𝛼2 = 0.5. In order to highlight the results in the first few days, I
only plot the results of the first 50 days. However, the trend remains the same for any period
afterwards.

Figure 4: Reported infections and deaths for two differently composed populations under
proportionate mixing

Homophilic mixing
Finally, we consider the case of homophilic mixing, i.e. ℎ > 0. Again, we compare two
populations, in which one is composed of 50% corona sceptics (𝑆2 = 0.4995, 𝐼 = 0.0005) and
one with 20% corona sceptics (𝑆2 = 0.1998, 𝐼 = 0.0002). Both runs are parametrized with
𝑅01 = 1 and 𝑅02 = 2, 𝛼1 = 0.01 and 𝛼2 = 0.5:
Figure 5 shows that such a setup can indeed explain the empirics, if mixing is sufficiently
homophilic. The higher h, the longer can the reported infections in the population made up of
50% corona sceptics be lower than or equal to the reported infections in the population with
a 20% share of corona sceptics. At the same time, however, the number of deaths in the
population with more corona sceptics is always equal or higher. If mixing is sufficiently
homophilic, a population may permanently have at the same time a lower number of reported
infections and a higher number of deaths:

𝑅02 = 2 with varying degrees of homophily.

p. 19 / 28

The degree of homophily which is necessary to achieve such a pattern crucially depends on
𝑅01 and 𝑅02 . More specifically, less homophily in mixing is necessary, if 𝑅01 is lower and if the
gap between 𝑅01 and 𝑅02 is larger.4

Figure 7: Number of reported infections in two different populations for given 𝑅01 = 1 and
𝑅02 = 3 with varying degrees of homophily.

It can be seen easily that the implied homophily in social contacts is larger for a given h in both cases as the x in
the following equation becomes larger: 𝑅02 = 𝑥𝑅01 .

Figure 8: Number of reported infections in two different populations for given 𝑅01 = 0.5
and 𝑅02 = 2.5 with varying degrees of homophily.
Let us finally take a look at public health effects of the prevalence of corona sceptics and the
degree of homophily. As deaths in this simple model depend mechanically on the number of
true infections, the damage done by corona scepticism can be measured by tracking the
evolution of the susceptibles. Ceteris paribus, lower homophily translates to better health
outcomes for the corona sceptics and worse outcomes for the majority. Figure 9 shows the
number of susceptibles for each group for an equal-sized population with 𝑅01 = 1, 𝑅02 = 2,
𝛼1 = 0.01 and 𝛼2 = 0.5:

Figure 9: S1 and S2 for a population composed of two equal-sized groups with 𝑅01 = 1, 𝑅02 =
2.

Figure 5 already intuitively showed that the number of deaths is ceteris paribus lower if the
share of corona sceptics is smaller. Figure 10 finally shows an intricate interplay between the
share of corona sceptics and the degree of homophily. If homophily is low, the marginal public
health damage done by corona sceptics increases up to a population size of 50% and then
decreases, whereas it is almost constant for high levels of homophily. This means that a wellp. 21 / 28

The Impact of Corona Populism

Patrick Mellacher

mixed population can bear a certain fraction of corona sceptics, as long as they are not too
numerous. If the corona sceptics are a minority, the total damage is lowest in settings with no
or very low homophily, whereas it is lowest with high homophily, if the corona sceptics are
the majority. In both cases, however, the damage is highest for intermediate levels of
homophily, i.e. there is a non-linear relationship between the level of homophily and health
outcomes of the total population. There is, however, of course a linear relationship if we view
each group on its own (as shown in fig. 9).

Figure 10: The evolution of total susceptibles under varying degrees of homophily and sizes of
the corona sceptics for 𝑅01 = 1, 𝑅02 = 2.

Conclusion
In this paper, I first described corona populism as a political position which is “sceptical” of
the danger posed by the virus and the need for containment measures. Following Acemoglu
et al. (), I characterized this policy as populist, since it receives significant public support, but
the adverse effects on the majority of the population following its adoption would at the same
time predominate.
I then investigated whether the policy stance of the Austrian right-wing freedom party (FPÖ)
on the coronavirus crisis had an effect on public health outcomes in communities in which
p. 22 / 28

The Impact of Corona Populism

Patrick Mellacher

they receive large support. The policy stance of the FPÖ was characterized by a U-turn: until
the end of the first wave of infections, the FPÖ followed a strict pro-lockdown course. At the
end of April, however, the party switched to demanding “an end of the corona madness”, i.e.
the containment measures, thereby downplaying the threat posed by the virus and adopting
a corona populist attitude.
I merged a time series dataset of daily infections and deaths on the district level into two
separate cross-sectional datasets – one before, and one after the policy switch – to study the
correlation between support for the FPÖ and public health outcomes in two dimensions: the
number of reported infections and the number of deaths. Using the election result of the
national elections 2019 as a proxy for support for the FPÖ and controlling for various
demographic and socioeconomic variables, I showed that an increased FPÖ election result
predicts a) less infections and fatalities for the first wave, and b) no significant effect on
infections, but more fatalities after the policy switch. Regressions also showed a significant
effect on deaths controlling for (among others) the number of cases, i.e. the case fatality ratio
is higher in districts in which the FPÖ is stronger.
While the outcome regarding the first wave of infections supported the hypothesis that the
policy stance of the FPÖ has a big impact on the behavior of their voters, the outcome after
the policy switch seemed inconclusive and paradoxical. I hypothesized that it originates from
a self-selection bias inherent to the Austrian containment policies: The policy stance of the
FPÖ caused their voter base to take the virus less seriously, who then did not only practice
less social distancing, but also reported their symptoms less often, which means that they
were less likely tested.
In order to explore this hypothesis, I extended the classical SIRD to incorporate quarantine,
heterogeneous behavior and heterogeneous mixing. This model is populated with corona
sceptics and the majority, whereas the corona sceptics have a higher basic reproduction
number and a lower propensity to get tested. I explored the properties of such a model and
showed that it is able to reproduce the Austrian dynamics in a stylized way, if mixing is
sufficiently homophilic, i.e. if corona sceptics are much more likely to meet other corona
sceptics.

p. 23 / 28

The Impact of Corona Populism

Patrick Mellacher

I finally discussed the impact of homophily on health outcomes in both groups. The level of
homophily defines the way in which herd immunity is reached. Corona sceptics achieve the
best health outcomes, if mixing is not (very) homophilic, whereas the majority is best off, if
mixing is almost completely homophilic. Interestingly, for the society as a whole, both low and
high levels of homophily lead to better public health outcomes than intermediate homophily.
The research presented in this paper can be extended in numerous ways. First, it would be
interesting to study the cross-national impact of corona populism. Does its effect depend on
factors which are constant in Austria, but vary internationally, such as the governmental
coalition, the overall success of containment policies during the first wave etc.? Second, it
would be interesting to study in a more complex model. Agent-based models such as the
COVID-Town model (Mellacher 2020) are capable of modeling the spread of the virus via social
networks and explicitly modeled heterogeneous agents, who can follow sophisticated
behavioral rules. This level of analysis can be highly useful to better understand the impact of
corona scepticism. For instance, it may make a big difference whether a corona sceptic faces
many customers or is an unemployed person who largely stays at home. However, this
method can also help to better understand the emergence of corona scepticism, e.g. by
modeling heterogeneous risk preferences or even opinion dynamics of corona scepticism or
corona populism. I hope to be able to study some of these questions in the future.
