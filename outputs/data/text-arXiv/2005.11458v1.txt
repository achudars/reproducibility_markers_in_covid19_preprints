Abstract: With the spread and development of new epidemics, it is of great reference value
to identify the changing trends of epidemics in public emotions. We designed and
implemented the COVID-19 public opinion monitoring system based on time series
thermal new word mining. A new word structure discovery scheme based on the timing
explosion of network topics and a Chinese sentiment analysis method for the COVID-19
public opinion environment are proposed. Establish a "Scrapy-Redis-Bloomfilter"
distributed crawler framework to collect data. The system can judge the positive and
negative emotions of the reviewer based on the comments, and can also reflect the depth
of the seven emotions such as Hopeful, Happy, and Depressed. Finally, we improved the
sentiment discriminant model of this system and compared the sentiment discriminant error
of COVID-19 related comments with the Jiagu deep learning model. The results show that
our model has better generalization ability and smaller discriminant error. We designed a
large data visualization screen, which can clearly show the trend of public emotions, the
proportion of various emotion categories, keywords, hot topics, etc., and fully and
intuitively reflect the development of public opinion.
Keywords: COVID-19, public opinion monitoring, data mining, Chinese sentiment
analysis, data visualization.
1 Introduction
Since December 2019, COVID-19 has been a hot topic for people to discuss on the Internet.
In this era of highly developed networks, the open nature of the network and the democratic
atmosphere have promoted the development of online public opinion. The situation of
epidemic public opinion can affect major industries such as commerce, medical care,

transportation, education, and even contribute to scientific research. Analyzing the
epidemic situation and public opinion scientifically and systematically to trace the
development of public opinion and analyze the changes in public sentiment. It can serve
individuals, governments, and even countries. Providing a reliable reference when
weighing the "pros and cons" can also predict the key events that can detonate public
opinion in the future, so analyzing and visualizing epidemic public opinion data is an
indispensable task. Traditional analysis systems include public opinion communication
analysis, public opinion feedback analysis, and public opinion subject analysis. The
traditional public opinion analysis system has two directions, content analysis, and
empirical analysis.
Scientifically and systematically analyzing the dynamic development of public opinion
from the perspective of the epidemic has the following significance: (1) It can assist the
government to implement precise policies and alleviate social panic. During times of public
crises, governments must act swiftly to communicate crisis information effectively and
efficiently to members of the public [Chen, Min, Zhang et al. (2020)]. The government can
implement soothing measures based on changes in public sentiment. Only by keeping
abreast of public sentiment dynamics can be the level of public opinion guidance be
strengthened; (2) Formulate appropriate isolation measures for the changes in public
sentiment, reduce social problems, and reduce various conflicts caused by public unrest.
For example, family conflicts, doctor-patient relationship conflicts, and business conflicts
caused by emotional unrest; (3) Formulate corresponding economic policies stimulus
emotional changes to promote economic recovery. It can also adjust the market according
to the changes in people's emotions and demand relationships to achieve the purpose of
promoting consumption; (4) It can provide a basis for universities to formulate school
opening policies and adjust the school opening time; (5) These findings can help the
government and health departments better communicate with the public on health and
translate public health needs into practice to create targeted measures to prevent and control
the spread of COVID-19 [Zhan, Cheng, Yu et al. (2020)].
Therefore, we designed and implemented a COVID-19 public opinion and emotion
monitoring system. The system is divided into three modules: text mining, text cleaning
and sentiment analysis. In terms of text mining, we use the “Scrapy-Redis-Bloomfilter”
distributed crawler framework to crawl corpus, and take Weibo comments as experimental
objects. In terms of text cleaning, the system will automatically assemble the corpus in the
database and complete the corresponding cleaning work. In terms of sentiment analysis,
we try to construct a Chinese word segmentation dictionary using a new idea. In order to
make up for the lack of effectiveness of the emotion dictionary in recognizing “infinitive
adjective sentences”, we designed a set of preparatory schemes for emotion mapping, and
considered the influence of adverbials in the sentence on emotion expression. Finally, we
converted the research results into interactive charts and hosted them on the big data
visualization platform.
2 Related Work
2.1 Data crawling

COVID-19 Public Opinion and Emotion Monitoring System

??

Obtaining effective data from the Internet is an important part of data analysis. Pais et al.
[Pais, Cordeiro, Martins et al. (2019)] develop a specific social network crawler based on
API interaction. The APIs provided by the social network can easily and conveniently
obtain structured data. So Naskar et al. [Naskar, Singh, Kumar et al. (2020)] use the SearchAPI provided by Twitter to analyze the emotional dynamics of users’ comments on an
event or topic on Twitter. Unfortunately, concerning some social networks, such as
Facebook, Twitter, Weibo, etc., limited access token dates, API data content, and access
times can significantly hamper data collection. Crawler techniques using web crawling
have no such limitations. Li et al. [Li, Xu, and Pan (2018)]'s approach is based on Python's
selenium to launch the browser, simulate login, analyze the page, and finally get the data
from Weibo. Selenium is a great way to deal with the complex login mechanism involved
in crawling Weibo data. However, as a suite of tools for automating web browsers, it is not
ideal for crawling large amounts of data. Faced with the low data capture rate of a single
crawler, Yin et al. [Yin, He and Liu (2018)] propose an improved distributed scheme. With
the good asynchronous capability of Scrapy, this scheme introduces the distributed
components of the Scrapy-Redis and Redis database into the Scrapy framework and
establishes a more efficient distributed crawler system. The data acquisition part of the
COVID-19 epidemic opinion analysis system also uses the Scrapy-Redis distributed
framework as the main workflow, and the Bloom Filter, a deduplication algorithm based
on binary vectors and hash functions, filters and processes the URLs before and after
fetching.
2.2 Sentiment analysis
This paper mainly uses text sentiment analysis for data processing, which is a hot research
direction of NLP. Its purpose is to mine emotional tendency by analyzing some subjective
texts [Li, Jin, and Quan (2020)]. There are two research methods commonly used in text
emotion analysis: machine-based learning and dictionary-based [Koupaei, Song, Kristen
et al. (2020)]. It is to extract some positive and negative emotion texts from texts as training
sets, and classify all texts in positive and negative directions according to the obtained
emotion classifiers. The final classification can be a probability value or a 0 or 1 category
given for texts. Although this method has been applied in many fields, there are still some
shortcomings: (1) It needs manual annotation of training model data, which is timeconsuming and laborious. (2) Due to the flexible structure and usage of Chinese sentences,
there are many interference factors in feature selection, such as the specialized thesaurus,
syntactic structure, information entropy [Shaukat, Zulfiqar, Xiao et al. (2020)]. (3) When
the scale of text data is large, there is no guarantee of high accuracy. In contrast, if we can
get a large and high-quality emotional dictionary, then we can get more satisfactory results
by combining the corresponding semantic rules [Kumar and Babu (2020)].
The key point of emotion classification based on the dictionary is the construction of the
dictionary. At present, domestic and foreign scholars have made some achievements. Nie
et al. [Nie, Tian and Wang et al. (2020)] built a new hotel selection model based on online
text review on tripadvisor.com, put forward a semantic mapping function and a method of
building a dictionary, and finally verified the validity of the model through case analysis,
robustness analysis, and comparative analysis. Chen et al. [Chen, Li, Wang et al. (2020)]
proposed a learning framework based on multi-source information fusion (MSIF),

??

CMC, vol.?, no.?, pp.??, 2020

extracted four kinds of emotional information: lexical emotional information, emotional
word co-occurrence information, emotional word polarity information and emotional word
polarity relationship information, and solved the construction problem of domain
emotional dictionary. Ahmed et al. [Ahmed, Chen, and Li (2020)] proposed an attentionbased LSTM model to deal with the aspect level emotion analysis task of emotion score
retrieved from the proposed dictionary. In a specific sentence, the non-emotional part of
the aspect related information is weighted, and the problem of polarity detection in the
dictionary is effectively improved. To sum up, although the construction of domain
dictionaries is relatively mature, there are not many involved in the construction of basic
dictionaries, or the scale of the selected basic dictionaries is too small. Due to the different
application scenarios, we need to select the appropriate basic emotion dictionary and build
a reasonable field emotion dictionary. This research integrates resources such as Tsinghua
commendatory and derogatory dictionary, Weibo public opinion dictionary, Dalian
University of technology emotion ontology vocabulary, uses SO-PMI mutual information
algorithm to build an emotion dictionary related to COVID-19, which applies to the
network language environment, and subdivides the emotional particles to analyze seven
emotional results. It realizes the dynamic multi-angle visualization of the changes of public
emotion under the epidemic situation, which can be helpful for the grasp of public
psychology and the prevention and control of the epidemic situation.
3 Methodology
3.1 Text mining
3.1.1 Crawler frame selection
The "Scrapy-Redis-Bloomfilter" distributed crawler framework is the main workflow of
capturing comments [Deng, Liu, and Dong (2018)]. When the number of crawling levels
exceeds 100 million, Redis will occupy a lot of space. At the same time, Redis will also
occupy memory due to the storage of crawling queues, which makes it difficult to achieve
simultaneous crawling of Scrapy projects. Here we use a more memory-saving
deduplication algorithm Bloom Filter, which has huge advantages in space and time.
Bloom Filter first uses a bit array to represent a set to be detected, and can quickly
determine whether an element exists in this set through a probabilistic algorithm, to achieve
the deduplication effect.

3.1.2 Anti-anti-reptile technology
To fully respond to the more flexible anti-acquisition strategy of the hot search of Weibo,
we have prepared multiple sets of solutions to counter the detection of anti-reptiles on
Weibo to ensure cloud acquisition tasks. The specific plan is as follows:
(1) Rewrite the proxy IP pool maintenance script. Monitor the websites of several major
proxy IP providers in China, use the "dual process + multi-thread multi-coroutine"
maintenance mode, and operate the "proxy IP pool verification" and "proxy IP pool
rotation" asynchronously to ensure that the available IP survival rate is 90%. The above
guarantees that more than 100 HTTPS-type proxy IPs can be used by the main crawler
framework in real-time. The use frequency of proxy IP is controlled at 1/5 minutes.
(2) Monitor the homepages of 24 domestic network service providers based on the STAFF

??

CMC, vol.?, no.?, pp.??, 2020

framework, collect the relay server IP; the distributed crawler carries Socks5 to disguise
HTTPS traffic for global access.
(3) Prepare 200 micro-blog verification-free accounts, regularly simulate login cracking
verification to ensure that the cookie pool is available.
3.1.3 Data analysis
We have chosen two methods for data analysis to ensure that most useless information is
filtered.
Priority call the crawler intelligent analysis library newspaper, compared to readability, the
function provided by the newspaper library is more powerful. First of all, the Article class
is first imported into the newspaper library, directly passed in the URL, and its download
method is called. Then we execute the parse method to intelligently parse the web page.
Finally, according to the needs of the project, intelligently filter useless data.
In Scrapy, there are two ways to extract data, one is Xpath selector and the other is CSS
selector. In the Scrapy crawler framework, the text () function is often used together with
Xpath expressions to extract the data content of the node. Therefore, in this experiment,
we use Scrapy's built-in parser Scrapy Selector's XPath tool to parse HTML information.
3.2 Data cleaning
Data cleaning, also called data cleansing or scrubbing, which means detecting and
removing errors or inconsistencies from data to improve the quality of data [Wang, Wang,
Yang et al. (2020)]. The main goal of data cleaning is to prepare for the next sentiment
analysis, and segmentation of phrases is the key to data preprocessing.
The word segmentation method is based on the word frequency statistics of the existing
corpus. For large-scale texts obtained from Weibo, Out of Vocabulary has a greater impact
on the accuracy of word segmentation than ambiguous segmentation, especially network
new words from Weibo are often not registered in the corpus. Hidden Markov model plays
an important role in natural language processing (NLP) for PART-OF-SPEECH (POS)
tagging. Nambiar et al. built a Hidden Markov model by using the existing marker
sentences in Malayan language [Nambiar, Leons, Jose et al. (2019)]. The Viterbi algorithm
based on the HMM model predicts the optimal hidden state sequence satisfying the
observation sequence by giving the known observation sequence and model parameters.
(1) According to the different components of the word in the phrase, create a tuple. The
tuple containing four status is Status [3] = [B (located at the beginning), E (located at the
end), M (located between the phrases), S (separately formed words)]; Set a Weight and
Path for each Chinese character (Weight: under a certain state, the probability of occurrence
of the word, Path: represents the state of the previous word when the emission probability
of a certain word reaches the maximum value).
(2) Use the Viterbi algorithm to calculate the weight of the entire text
Implicit state transition probability matrix:

(1)

Observed [i] represents the i-th font of the observed text sequence, Observed [i-1]
represents the i-1th font; according to the limited historical assumption of the HMM model,
where Pij = P (Observed [i] | Status [j]), indicating the probability of Observes [i] appearing
in a certain state.
Calculate the weight [Observed [0]] of the first word in four states:
Weight (Observed [0]) = P (Observed [1], Status [i]) = P (Status [i]) * P (Observed [0] |
Status [i]);
By comparison, the maximum weight of each font is obtained to determine its
corresponding status, which is the "optimal Path".
After getting all the "optimal paths", traverse the status value set of the output text
according to its backtracking, and segment the phrases according to the different states of
the text. The overall method process is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: The Viterbi algorithm based on the HMM was used to segment the
unregistered words
3.3 Sentiment analysis
Compared with other text analysis, the text sentiment analysis part is a relatively difficult
one. For the task of text emotion classification, we first extract emotion features from
documents, and then use the classifier to classify them [Yi Cai, Kai Yang, Dongping Huang
et al. (2019)]. In this study, sentiment dictionaries for the microblog review environment
are selected as classification features, and a naive Bayesian method is used to construct a
classifier for text sentiment analysis. Finally. we subdivide the emotional particles.

??

CMC, vol.?, no.?, pp.??, 2020

3.3.1 Establish a microblog comment sentiment dictionary
The coverage and completeness of the dictionary often determine the final analysis effect.
To improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis, we need to expand on the existing Weibo
public opinion dictionary [Zhao Jia-Lin, Li Meng-Zhu, Yao Juan et al. (2019)]. The method
used in this study is to integrate and select the appropriate open-source sentiment dictionary
and use the SO-PMI mutual information algorithm to quickly and easily build a domain
sentiment dictionary related to COVID-19 and adapted to the network language
environment.
The general sentiment dictionaries we selected are Tsinghua sentiment dictionary,
BoSonNLP praise and derogatory dictionary, Dalian University of Technology emotional
ontology library. Considering that the network's new word update speed is very fast, we
choose to analyze the sampled information of each day based on the time dimension based
on these general sentiment dictionaries to discover new words and expand our sentiment
dictionaries.
3.3.2 Text preprocessing
Text preprocessing includes Chinese word segmentation and removal of stop words. The
Chinese word segmentation has been elaborated in the above, so I won't go into detail here.
To remove stop words is to traverse all the words in the corpus and delete the stop words.
For example: Nanjing has never had such a small number of people on the street, never
been so quiet, the dream of working at work without traffic jams, even happened at such a
time. After removal: never / no / so / less / never / no / so / quiet / no / actually.
3.3.3 Build the model
3.3.3.1 Construct a naive Bayes classifier to classify words
Perform a preliminary polarity classification on the word segmentation results to determine
whether it is positive or negative. Naive Bayes algorithm is used here.
Naive Bayesian classifier (NBC) assumes that the influence of an attribute value on a given
class is independent of the value of other attributes. This assumption is called class
conditional independence, and in this sense is called naive. It is an algorithm based on
probability, which calculates the posterior probability that the Y variable belongs to a
certain category according to certain prior probabilities. The specific steps are: based on
the constructed vector matrix, the calculation formula is as follows:

𝐶𝑁𝐵 = 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎 𝐶𝑗 ∈𝐶𝑋 {𝑃(𝐶𝑗 ) ∏𝑛𝑖=1 𝑃(𝑤𝑖 , 𝑐𝑗 )𝑤𝑡(𝑤𝑖 ) }

(2)

Among them: 𝑃(𝐶𝑗 ) is the prior probability of the category; 𝑃(𝑤𝑖 , 𝑐𝑗 ) is the posterior
probability of the feature word 𝑤𝑖 in the category; 𝑤𝑡(𝑤𝑖 )is the weight of the word 𝑤𝑖
in the test corpus, when the bool weight is used, 𝑤𝑡(𝑤𝑖 )=1 .
For the prior probability, this study uses the annotated corpus to estimate in advance, and
the calculation formula is as follows:

COVID-19 Public Opinion and Emotion Monitoring System

𝑃(𝑐𝑗 ) = ∑

𝑑𝑜𝑐(𝑐𝑗 )

??
(3)

𝑐𝑗 ∈𝐶 𝑑𝑜𝑐(𝑐𝑗 )

Where doc(cj) is the number of texts belonging to the category cj
For the posterior probability, this study uses the sum of the weight of the word w j in the
text of cj divided by the sum of the weight of all the words in the text of cj. The specific
calculation formula is as follows:

𝑃(𝑤𝑖 , 𝑐𝑗 ) = ∑𝑛

𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡(𝑤𝑖 ,𝑐𝑗 )+𝛿

(4)

𝑖=1 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡(𝑤𝑖 ,𝑐𝑗 )+𝛿|𝑉|

(V= ∑c ∈C ∑ni=1 weight(wi ,cj ),δ=
j

1
)
|V|

Loop through the remaining fonts of the text:

Where weight(wi ,cj ) is the sum of the weights of the word wi in the text belonging to
the category cj .
NBC is also known as the optimal classifier, and it has outstanding performance in text
classification applications. When processing large-scale data sets, the classification
accuracy is high and the implementation is relatively simple.
3.3.3.2 Subdivide emotional particles
The 7-dimensional emotional level is scored through the emotional ontology and custom
extended dictionary of the Dalian University of Technology. The higher the score, the
greater the proportion of this emotion.
The emotions in the vocabulary ontology are divided into seven types: Hopeful, Happy,
Depressed, Angry, Frightened, Disappointed, Shocked, the emotional intensity is: 1, 3, 5,
7, 9, 5 levels, 9 intensity is the largest, 1 intensity is the least. Each word corresponds to
information such as polarity under each type of emotion. Turn the above segmentation
result into a dictionary.
Classify the results of word segmentation, find emotion words, negative words, and degree
adverbs.
First set the initial weight W to 1, start with the first sentiment word, use the weight W *
sentiment value of the sentiment word as the score (recorded with score), and then
determine whether there are a degree adverb and negative word with the next sentiment
word. If there is a negative word, W * -1 if there is a degree adverb, W * degree adverb
degree value, W at this time as the weight value of traversing the next emotion word, loop
until all emotion words have been traversed, the sum of the scores during each traversal is
the sentiment score of this sentence. The predicted value is in the form of a cumulative sum,
and the larger the score of the last category the more predicted the category. (In which case
there will be negative numbers, you need to find the absolute value before comparing).

4.1 Brief description of experimental objects and framework
Social media represented by Weibo is an important platform for people to express their
emotions and feelings. Weibo has the characteristics of the last update, wide information
sharing, and rapid spread. Users can obtain and publish information according to their
interests and preferences, so choose Weibo Bo is the experimental object.
Through the crawler protocol, we request data on Weibo information about the COVID-19
epidemic, analyze the obtained data, parse the web page, and extract text information. To
ensure that the experimental data is more accurate, we take two preprocessing of data
cleaning the sentiment analysis of the text will store the obtained experimental data.
4.2 Experimental configuration
In this experiment, we chose a computer with a memory type of DDR4 2400MHz and a
hard disk capacity of 128GB SSD + 2TB HDD for the entire experiment. The following

4.3 Visualized large screen display
Compared with traditional charts and data dashboards, today's data visualization is
dedicated to presenting business insights hidden behind rapidly changing and complex data
in a more vivid and friendly form. Whether in retail, logistics, electricity, water
conservancy, environmental protection, or transportation, interactive real-time data
visualization large screens help business personnel to discover and diagnose business
problems and increasingly become an indispensable part of big data solutions. Therefore,
for the part of visually displaying the analyzed data, we chose the Baidu intelligent cloud
product Sugar, which uses a large-screen visualization method to analyze and display
complex data products. The purpose is to let more people see the charm of data
visualization. Interface to build professional-level visualization pages.

Figure 6: Classification of user emotions under the COVID-19 epidemic
There are two kinds of emotions: positive and negative, but positive and negative alone are
not enough to express people's deeper emotions. This experiment further refines the
emotions of Weibo users and subdivides richness based on positive and negative. Come up
with seven detailed emotions: hopeful, happy, depressed, disappointed, angry, frightened
and shocked, and through the data analysis of the number of Weibo users and the proportion
of each emotion, we can better understand the deep emotions of blog users, and can more
accurately determine the user's emotional attitude towards the COVID-19.

Figure 7: Changes in the percentage of user emotion classification within a specified
period

Figure 7 shows seven deeper changes in positive and negative emotional cycles. We have
analyzed the changes in the emotional cycle from the severe period of the COVID-19 from
February to early April 2020, and we can clearly see the changes in seven emotions in each
period from the figure. You can grasp and judge public opinion more scientifically and
effectively. As shown in Figure 7, we can observe that since mid-February, people have
become more and more positive in the face of the COVID-19, and their negative emotions
have declined.

Figure 8: Keyword representation by part of speech
Different parts of speech often have different effects. We choose the verbs, adjectives,
related names, country names, and institution names of users regarding COVID-19.
Adjectives can best express the emotions of Weibo users, such as safety and health; country
names can reflect the user's concern about the epidemic situation in various countries of
the world; and the name of the person is the focus and hot person in the COVID-19
epidemic situation, which can often drive the direction of public opinion. For example,
Professor Zhong Nanshan's speech has a great influence on public opinion; the emergence
of hot words from institutions also reflects the public's concern about the epidemic. For
example, the construction process of Vulcan Mountain Hospital affects people's hearts.

Figure 9: Chinese word cloud
The Chinese word cloud generated after the analysis of the text of this experiment. The
content of the word cloud includes China, epidemic situation, refueling, virus, isolation,
etc.; the word cloud is a visual representation of the text data, which is composed of words
and a cloud-like color graphic used to display a large number of texts. data. At the same
time, the importance of each word is displayed in font size or color, which allows the
viewer to perceive the weight of certain keywords most quickly. Keywords often indicate
the trend of public opinion.

Figure 10: Emotional score chart of designated hot words
We randomly selected 13 hot words which Weibo users to search and discuss such as the
diagnosis, closed the city, concealed the condition, and return safely and so on, because

??

CMC, vol.?, no.?, pp.??, 2020

these hot words can best represent the public's attitudes and sentiments about the COVID19, and can best reflect public opinion. Because each hot word contains a variety of
complex and comprehensive emotions, we use these emotional words to score the sevendimensional emotional level through the Dalian University of Technology's emotional
ontology and a custom extended dictionary. The higher the score, the greater the proportion
of this emotion. The significance of this graph is that it can make predictive instructions,
such as adding hot words such as workers returning to work, students returning to school,
etc., we can understand the user's emotional attitude to this event, so that the relevant
departments can make better decisions.
4.5 Comparative experiment
Jiagu deep learning natural language processing tools can perform natural language
processing and emotional analysis to a certain extent, but Jiagu natural language processing
often has certain errors with the actual language emotion expression. Our modified model
can better perform natural language. Sentiment analysis reduces errors and improves the
accuracy of sentiment analysis. In this experiment, we randomly sampled 4000 comments
of Weibo users after data cleaning, and conducted experiments with Jiagu and our revised
model, and compared the experimental results.

Figure 11: Comparison of Jiagu and Modified model with Real data under random
sampling
As shown in Figure 11, divide the comments of chosen randomly divided eight samples,
using the modified model and Jiagu to deal with each sample and sentiment analysis
respectively, with the real data as a reference of artificial judgment, draw eight-bar chart
(1, 2, 3 lines represent the Jiagu, correction model and real data). The results show that,
within the allowable range of error, the proportion of emotion partition obtained by using
the modified model is closer to the real data and the error is smaller than that obtained by
using Jiagu.

Figure 12: Error analysis chart of comparative experiment between Jiagu and Modified
model
We use 0.2 as the boundary to divide the error gradient and compare the 1991 positive
comments of the modified model with the 2000 positive comments processed by Jiagu.
Observe the Figure 12 to judge the error of Jiagu and the modified model. We can see
clearly from these three bar charts that the error of the modified model is less than that of
Jiagu. It should be noted that since some sentences cannot be commented on for emotional
analysis, there is a 0.5% error in this experiment that cannot be judged in the experiment.
5 Conclusion and our future work
In this work, we designed the COVID-19 public opinion and emotion monitoring system
based on time series thermal new word mining. Our system has the following two
innovative attempts. First of all, given the characteristics of COVID-19 public opinion

??

CMC, vol.?, no.?, pp.??, 2020

communication, we tried to use an improved dictionary construction method based on the
SO-PMI algorithm to help us adapt to the COVID-19 network public opinion environment
under the conditions of limited transferable models and insufficient seed corpus. Build a
Chinese word segmentation dictionary. Secondly, we have comprehensively absorbed the
experience methods of many excellent Chinese sentiment analysis models and designed a
set of discriminating processes on this system. When the sentiment dictionary cannot
directly and effectively classify the deep emotions of the text, we can classify and
discriminate according to the benchmark positive and negative emotion Confidence maps
emotions to deep emotions to achieve indirect classification. At the same time, we have
integrated some excellent online lexicons and emotional lexicons to further expand the
lexical corpus and improve the accuracy of system discrimination. We compare the
improved model with the Jiagu deep learning model. The results show that the improved
model has a stronger level of generalization and a lower discrimination error. Finally, we
designed a large data visualization screen to share the team's research results. The data
displayed includes but is not limited to fluctuations in the emotional timing of netizens on
related topics, the overall distribution of netizens' emotions, and comment hot words.
At present, our experiment has tapped 1,526 hot topics and 190,242 hot comments.
However, there are still problems in our experiment. The experimental results show that
the sentiment discrimination model of this system is more sensitive to the positive elements
in the sentence. Although we have considered the influence of adverbials in the sentence
on the pessimistic tone, the effect is limited. We have not given reliable experiments to
prove that the system's decision process is equally effective in other corpus environments.
And this model has not considered the emotional impact of the expression package on the
comment text.
Our future work includes the following 3 aspects. First, we will consider the effect of
expression packs on emotional expression. The use of emoticons in online language can
greatly enhance the emotional color, but our data mining process artificially removes these
factors. Netizens of different ages have different understandings of the same set of
emoticons, and we cannot obtain comments through normal channels. The age information
of the person. Second, we will continue to expand the Chinese sentiment dictionary of
online public opinion related to the spread of the virus. Online language is changing with
each passing day, and different online groups each have a set of online slang. Traditional
dictionaries cannot recognize these words very accurately. A good dictionary can increase
the efficiency of word segmentation and improve the generalization ability, accuracy, and
recall rate of the model. Finally, we will optimize the crawler framework, moderately
increase the request frequency, and improve the overall crawling efficiency. To ensure that
the crawler still has enough information crawling ability when it touches some sensitive
information, we even introduced a scheme to disguise anonymous proxy access, but it
greatly slowed down the data crawling speed.
