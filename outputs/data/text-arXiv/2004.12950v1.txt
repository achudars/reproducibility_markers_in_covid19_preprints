We have proposed a new form of growth rate for population ecology. Generally, the growth rate is
dependent on the size of the population at that particular epoch. We have introduced an alternative
time-dependent form of growth rate. This form satisfies essential conditions to represent population
growth and can be an alternative form for growth models to analyze population dynamics. We have
employed the generalized Richards model as a guideline to compare our results. Further, we have
applied our model in the case of epidemics. To check the efficacy of our model, we have verified the
2003 SARS data. This model has estimated the final epidemic size with good accuracy. Thereafter,
we intend to describe the present COVID-2019 pandemic. We have performed our analysis with
data for Italy, Spain, and Germany. Following, we have tried to predict the number of COVID-19
cases and the turning point for the USA, UK, and India.

INTRODUCTION

The time evolution of population growth is fundamentally interesting from both the point of ecology and
physics [1]. Certain factors and limiting conditions determine the trajectory of a population density. The growth
rate seems to depend on the population size and follows
some general differential equations. Various epidemic diseases also follow the same dynamical pattern [2–6]. One
can predict the progress of an epidemic and the cumulative number of cases by studying these models, which
may provide insights into ongoing outbreaks to expedite
public health responses.
Recently a pandemic condition has emerged, causing
severe pneumonia and respiratory disorder. The first
cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause was reported on 31st December 2019 at Wuhan, Hubei, China.
On 30th January 2020, WHO first declared COVID-19 as
a serious public health concern, and then on March 11th
it was recognized as a pandemic [7]. The International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) identified
this virus as ”Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2)[8]. This is giving rise to an
enormous number of cases of pneumonia. Governments
are attempting to exercise all measures and rapid movements to control this pandemic. In February 2020, cumulative cases in SARSCoV-2 exceeded the previous SARS
outbreak. These emerging infections have become a serious concern over the last two decades, with absolutely no
specific control measures and proper medication. Recent
studies have conferred COVID-19 to have similarities in

disease patterns with previous SARS cases, [9–11].
Mathematical models [2–5, 12–18] may be utilized to
predict infectious disease spread. According to Keyfitz
Ref.[19], in the case of prediction, there is a difference
between ”projection” and forecast. Projection depends
on some set of assumptions and the data sets of that
particular epoch, whereas the forecast is an unconditional
statement of future trajectory. In a stochastic system
like population growth and epidemics, these two seem to
supervise each other.
In epidemic studies, one can employ the growth equations to provide estimates of the cumulative number of
cases, peak timing, infection rate, etc. These approaches
allow us to predict the future dynamics of the epidemics,
associated with the best fit to data. A general logistic equation (first proposed in Ref. [20]) with a sigmoid
shaped solution for cumulative number may have a good
approximation of the final epidemic size and the turning point. Richards model Ref.[21] further generalized
this with an extra added parameter. The performance of
the various logistic model and the generalized Richards
model (GRM) ([2] and references therein) can be calibrated with available epidemic data. GRM’s phenomenological nature was capable to estimate the most accurate
growth rate and final epidemic size [16]. In a general
case, there can be multiple waves of an epidemic, so implementing a multi-phase Richards model with multiple
turning points depending on the interval may be important Ref.[22].
Following the eruption of COVID-19, several studies
have made short-time predictions and forecasted the dynamics. Ref.[18] predicted the final cumulative numbers of cases from both the logistic and SIR (Susceptibles Infectives Removed) model. Ref.[23] has investigated cumulative numbers of cases from the early data

2
of Hubei, China. In the case of an imposed lockdown, there will be local maxima and minima in daily
outbreaks, where an SEIR-type (Susceptible-ExposedInfectious-Recovered) type model may fail. Ref.[24] has
discussed this. Recently Ref.[25, 26] has tried to investigate the importance of lockdown and difference in sigmoid and exponential like growth for various states of
India.
The common perception from all the studies is that
growth rate and various estimated parameters are highly
dependent on the available data. So with possible uncertainties, the predictions from these models may or may
not match at the end of the pandemic. But applying
these models may capture the essence of the outbreak
via short time predictions and help to take preventive
steps. These are also helpful in government interventions
and to impose lockdown, which may reduce the number
of cases and fatalities.
In this manuscript, we have introduced a different approach to describe the growth rate. Rather than relating
the growth rate to population size, we have advocated
a simple time-dependent form of growth rate equation.
Our method seems to have all the necessary elements to
describe a general population growth and has delineated
the previous SARS-2003 epidemic data suitably. Further,
we have analyzed data of COVID-19 for Italy, Germany,
and Spain as a benchmark study and then tried to predict the future scenario in the case of the USA, the UK,
and India. We have used the Generalized Richards Model
(GRM) as a guideline for these results. There are beautiful agreements between GRM and our model estimation.
This simple form of growth rate can be a viable alternative for various ecological growth models.
We have reviewed the logistic model and GRM in section II and described our proposed form of equations in
section III. In section IV we have explained our results
and finally, we have summarized in V.

II.

GROWTH MODELS IN POPULATION
ECOLOGY

The growth of a population can be represented by some
general laws [27]. In the canonical picture, one can find
a pattern for the growth of a population. That is,
dN
≈ rN
dt

(1)

Here, r determines the relative growth rate or growth
rate per capita. N is the population size, and dN/dt is
the rate of change. The growth of a population depends
on general constraints like availability of resources, environmental conditions, birth rate, death rate, etc. The
growth rate (r) becomes negative when the population
size N crosses a threshold value (K).

Generalized Richards Model (GRM)

In the standard logistic model proposed by Verhulst
(1838), the growth rate of a population is proportional
to the size of the population and constrained by a maximum number of population (K). Let N (t) represent
the population size at time t. In the logistic model, this
evolves as follows (Ref.[2] and references therein):


dN (t)
N (t)
(2)
= rN (t) 1 −
dt
K
Here, r is the growth rate and K is the carrying capacity. Richards generalized this model with one additional
parameter a [21].
a 


N (t)
dN
(3)

K
a measure the deviation from the standard logistic model.
In Ref.[2], the exponential term has been shown to have
a relation with the basic reproduction number R0 , which
is defined as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population. The solution of Eq.3
is,
i−1/a
h
N (t) = K 1 + ae−ar̃(t−tp )

(4)

where tp is the turning point defined as the time when
the rate dN (t)/dt becomes maximum. We can evaluate
the time (tp ) from,
d
(dN/dt) = 0
dt
The Generalized Richards Model (GRM) was initially introduced in the context of ecological population growth.
Recently this model has been studied in epidemiology
for real-time prediction of diseases [3–5]. We shall use
this model as a guideline in our study for the ongoing
pandemic COVID-19. For simplification, we have done
a rescaling r = ar̃, following Ref.[2]. We shall use the
rescaled form of cumulative cases Eq.[4].

III.

NEW APPROACH

In the case of epidemics, one can relate dN/dt with
the number of daily infected persons, i.e new informed
cases per day. From data of daily infections [28], it seems
that the general trend of dN/dt for COVID-19 follows a
skewed pattern. The general perception is that rapid
growth is followed by an exponential decay. In standard
population ecology, a general rate equation depends on
the cumulative population N (t) of that particular time.
Here we have taken a different approach and investigated
whether one can study this growth pattern only as a function of time.

3
We have performed normalization of daily new
case data with the maximum value, which is
(dN/dt)/(dN/dt)max . The general trend of this normalized increment has similarity with chi-distributions,
where the general form is,
2

f (x; k) =

xk−1 e−x /2

2k/2−1 Γ k2

(5)

here Γ(z) is the gamma function. This distribution has
one parameter k, which specifies the degrees of freedom.
The denominator of Eq.[5] corresponds to normalizing
factor.
Noticing this trend, we intend to propose a new growth
rate equation. A MaxwellBoltzmann distribution gives
rise to a symmetric distribution of dN/dt with time. But
we have noticed that in most of the cases, the tail of the
curve is stretched. A right-skewed distribution pattern
has been observed for most of the countries, which does
not follow a gaussian structure. So rather than assuming
a particular structure, here we propose a generalized rate
of infection dN/dt,
n
dN
= f (t) = tm e−(t/λ)
dt

(6)

f is a funtion of time. To understand the important of
these paramters, let’s look at the derivative of Eq.6,
N′
n
dN ′
=
m[1 − (t/λ)n ]
dt
t
m

(7)

We can find the time when the infection rate dN
dt reaches
2
its maximum point from Eq.[7]. At this point ddtN = 0.
In our model this time (tp ) is,
tp = λ(

m 1/n
)
n

(8)

So tp is proportional to λ. With this form of tp , Eq.7
becomes,
N′
dN ′
=
m[1 − (t/tp )n ]
dt
t

(9)

If t is much smaller than tp , the rate will be dominated
by the factor m and the rate will be proportional to tm i.e
dN/dt ≈ tm . Whereas, for t ≫ tp the fall of the growth
rate is controlled by the parameter n. So at later part of
the pandemic dN/dt ≈ exp(−tn ). In a pandemic disease
like COVID-19, one should expect a larger value of m
than n, as the infection spreads rapidly and sustains for
a long period.
One can estimate the cumulative number cases N (t) in
any time by integrating out dN/dt for any t. In our cases,
an exact analytical form could not be obtained, except
for the asymptotic limit t → ∞. We have performed
numerical integrations to find the number at any given
t. The growth rate will be 0 at t → ∞, so no new cases

will be informed and the cumulative number of cases for
the pandemic can be found as,

This Ntotal correspondence to carrying capacity (K) of
Generalized Richards Model of population growth and
can be assumed to be the size of the epidemic. With
the above formalism, we shall try to analyze the data
of SARS-2003 and COVID-19. Efficacy of our model can
be checked along with the generalized Richardson model,
via prediction of both Ntotal and tp .
IV.

RESULT AND DISCUSSION
Data analysis and formalism

First, we shall employ our model and GRM in data for
the SARS-2003 epidemic case. Studies on virology and
epidemiology of COVID-19 establish it as a zoonotic [29],
especially bat as an initial host. The previous epidemic
SARS 2003 also belongs to the same natural reservoir
[11]. Clinical studies on patients also have established a
close resemblance of COVID-19 with SARS [9]. SARS
CoV was transmitted globally and was declared an epidemic. Therefore, investigation with SARS data [30, 31]
will act as a benchmark study for the present pandemic.
We shall predict the turning point tp ( maximum growth
rate ) and the cumulative number of cases in SARS-CoV,
from both models. A satisfying agreement with the prediction from GRM will check the efficiency of our proposed rate equation. Then we shall apply our model in
case of the ongoing pandemic COVID-19.
In case of GRM model, the dN/dt is not an explicit
function of t, whereas the solution has a form of f (t).
So the t − dependent behavior can be investigated from
the cumulative data set. We have fitted cumulative data
of SARS with the GRM model and found the parameters K, a, r, and tp . Thereafter we employ these parameters to get the functional form of dN/dt. Whereas, with
our model, we have parameterized the data of daily new
cases and predicted n, m, and λ. As there is no analytical solution of N (t) from our model, we have to perform
numerical integrations to evaluate cumulative N (t). An
immediate crosscheck about the accuracy
R of our integration result can be done by performing N dt in the limit
[0, ∞] and employing Eq.[10]. Further, we have compared results for cumulative cases in both the model and
verified them with corresponding data.

Verification with SARS data

We have analyzed SARS data for 90 days from 17th
March to 17th June of 2003. We have parameterized our
model with data of daily informed new cases, whereas

4
the RGM has been fitted using the cumulative data. In
Fig.[1], we have plotted daily increment of SARS-2003
cases. Though our fitted curve (red line) has little difference with that of RGM (blue dashed), both seem to
replicate the data (orange bars) quite suitably.
Next, we try to predict cumulative data from our
model by performing numerical integration. As the saturation trend originates around 80 days, we have evaluated the cumulative number for a 120 days time period.
Though there is disagreement in the initial phase of the
cumulative curve, our model has suitably reproduced the
data in the later phase of the epidemic (once it reaches
tp ) in Fig.[2]. This disagreement may result from the
peak of day 17 of the increment curve.

There is a satisfying agreement in case of the predicted
value of tp and Ntotal , between our model and RGM. The
estimated values are listed in table [I]. Here we want to
emphasize that though we do not have an exact analytical

With the above formalism, we shall discuss the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19. We have utilized the data
for countries that have crossed 1 Lakh in total cases. We
have used data for Italy, Spain, and Germany in our initial study, with reported data as of 20th April 2020. Then
we shall try to predict the scenario for the USA, UK, and
India.
There is diversity in the initial growth pattern among
all the countries. This difference may depend on their geographical scenario, environment, and infection rate [32].
But we have noticed that the general behavior is identical
for all the cases, once the number of daily reported cases
(dN/dt) reaches around 100. We have counted that day
as Day 1 in our analysis. Data are available from February 15th in [28] for all countries. But depending on the
above-mentioned condition we have used data from the
last week of February for Italy and from the first week of
March for most of the countries.
In Fig.[3] we have shown results for Italy, Spain, and
Germany. These countries are important to understand
the behavior of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. For
all these cases, our model estimation (red continuous
line) seems to reproduce data (orange bar) suitably and
matches with that of the GRM (blue dashed line). The
growth rate increases as day lapses and reaches its maximum value around day 35 of our analysis. We have
listed the value of turning point tp from both the models in table [II]. Turning point determines the day when
the growth rate ( dN/dt ) reaches its maximum value.
Onwards this point the growth rate decreases and in the
asymptotic limit, it becomes zero.

In our model, the parameter m determines the initial
phase and controls the growth. A larger value of m is

5
responsible for a steeper rise. On the other hand, n determines the rate of decrease in the growth rate in the
later phase. In all the cases, there is a similarity among
the parameter sets (listed in table IV) and m is almost
three times higher than n. One can also infer that from
the trend of the daily reported case. There is a faster
increase in the number of cases, whereas the tail is extended. But in the case of GRM, the fitted value of
r and a (listed in table V) has variation among these
three countries. So the relative growth rate and basic
reproduction number are different. Whereas the m and
n have similar values in our model. This similarity may
have interesting consequences. This may indicate that
the growth pattern has an intrinsic time dependence, depending on environmental conditions and demography.
Further studies with data from different regions of the
globe may enlighten in this direction.
We have also estimated the epidemic size (Ntotal ) from
our model. This should match with the carrying capacity
K of GRM, as both determines the final cumulative number of cases. We have seen a good agreement in Fig.[3]
between the predictions of the total number of cases. Our
model successfully reproduced the total number of cases
for SARS-2003. Here we have estimated the Ntot as a
prediction from our model. In all these cases, the pandemic seems to decelerate after 80 days (80 days should
be counted from day 1 of our method i.e first day to report 100 new cases). Our model predictions have good
agreement with the available cumulative number, so we
can further utilize this model to predict growth rate and
final epidemic size in the future.
We have predicted cumulative numbers and tp for the
USA, the UK, and India from the available data set as
of 23rd April. Both models (GRM and this study) have
good agreement with the present data and have made
similar predictions. The daily reported case reached 100
for the first time on 6th , 12th , and 23th March respectively. So in the case of India, the pandemic is still at
the growth phase. In the case of the USA and the UK,
it seems that the growth curve has reached its peak. We
have listed our evaluated tp in table IV. In the USA and
UK, the pandemic is expected to reach the asymptotic
limit in 90 days from our day-1, with cumulative cases
13lakh and 2lakh respectively.
For India, GRM has predicted the date for the peak
(tp ) is around 5th May, whereas our model has predicted
around 8th May. This slight difference has an impact
on the final cumulative number of cases. GRM has estimated around 140000 total cases on 250th day, whereas
our model has determined the number to be around
130000. This difference of 10000 in the predicted total
number of cases may be related to the fitting procedure.
In the case of GRM, we have performed the fitting with
the cumulative data, whereas for our model we have utilized the daily data of newly reported cases.

We especially want to mention that, the study with

data of China could be really interesting in this context,
as this was the epicenter of the outbreak. But there are
some confusions regarding the data of China. On February 12th , Hubei province reported nearly 15000 new cases
in a single day. The growth rate tended to decline before this day and the maximum reported case was nearly
4000 on Feb 4th . Our model could not fit this sudden
rise with this limited number of parameters. Except for
this particular case, our data seems to have a satisfactory agreement. In the future, we shall try to describe
this kind of sudden rise, incorporating both cumulative
data and increment rate in our model.

V.

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

In this article, we have advocated a new form of the
growth rate of population ecology. The proposed rate
equation solely depends on time, with a combination
of both rapid rise and exponential decay. This simple
method may be useful to analyze the growth rate pattern
to time, independent of the population size. Our model
has estimated the turning point and carrying capacity
with good precision. We have evaluated the number of
cumulative cases by implementing numerical integration.
The elegance of our proposed rate equation remains in its
simplistic form with only three parameters. This model
can be a viable alternative to the growth model in general
population ecology.
Following the application of the ecological growth
model in the estimation of epidemic cases, we have tried
to utilize our data in the previous SARS-C0V case of
2003. Further, we have discussed the present pandemic
COVID-19 with our model. We have analyzed data for
Italy, Spain, Germany to check the efficacy of our model.
We have performed parametrization with the generalized
Richards model as a benchmark study for our model.
Our proposed model has a satisfying agreement with the

6
GRM model in evaluating the turning point and final
epidemic size for all the cases. We have also predicted
the USA, the UK, and India using both GRM and our
method. The pandemic seems to stay in India for a longer
period than other countries due to a slower growth rate
initially and late timing of the turning point. Certain external conditions like lockdown, rapid testing, etc. may
have effects on these growth patterns, but that is beyond
the scope of our present study.
In the case of GRM, the growth rate depends on the
population size, which may be misleading in the initial
phase of epidemic situations, as the number of the total
reported case remains very low. Whereas in our model
the growth rate is a simple function of t. So rapid predictions can be made from the number of newly reported
cases. Shortly, we shall intend to encounter these issues

with a further modified version of our model. This simple
and elegant form of growth rate equation may be widely
used for studying tumor cell growth, algal growth, etc.

FIG. 3.
(colors online) Plots for day vs. daily cases and
cumulative cases in COVID-19 for Italy, Spain and Germany.
Legends are same as mentioned in Fig.[1 2]. Data are from
[28]. Y axis in the left side denotes number of daily reported
cases (dN/dt) and right Y axis denotes cumulative cases. For
clarity we have plotted both cumulative and daily cases in
same graph. X axis is the number of days. Day 1 denotes
the day when daily reported case (dN/dt) was around 100 for
first time.
