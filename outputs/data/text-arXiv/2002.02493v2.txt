Abstract
In 2019, bus ridership in the United States attained its lowest level since 1973. If transit agencies
hope to reverse this trend, they must understand how their service allocation policies affect ridership. This paper is among the first to model ridership trends on a hyper-local level over time.
A Poisson fixed-effects model is developed to evaluate the ridership elasticity to frequency using
passenger count data from Portland, Miami, Minneapolis/St-Paul, and Atlanta between 2012 and
2018. In every agency, ridership is found to be elastic to frequency when observing the variation between individual route-segments at one point in time. In other words, the most frequent
routes are already the most productive in terms of passengers per vehicle-trip. When observing
the variation within each route-segment over time, however, ridership is inelastic; each additional
vehicle-trip is expected to generate less ridership than the average bus already on the route. In
three of the four agencies, the elasticity is a decreasing function of prior frequency, meaning that
low-frequency routes are the most sensitive to changes in frequency. This paper can help transit
agencies anticipate the marginal effect of shifting service throughout the network. As the quality
and availability of passenger count data improve, this paper can serve as the methodological basis
to explore the dynamics of bus ridership.

1. Introduction
Following seven years of consecutive decline, 2019 bus ridership in the United States was the
third-lowest year since World War II 1 . Each transit trip lost to private cars contributes to traffic
congestion, pollution, and road fatalities. The revenue lost from declining ridership also impedes
the ability of transit agencies to provide service, which hurts ridership further in a downward cycle.
Transit agencies, therefore, need to understand how this trend can be reversed and at what cost.
The main tools transit agencies have available to influence ridership are service allocation policies. Transit planners are tasked with setting frequencies throughout the network under constrained

resources. They must balance ridership with other, sometimes conflicting, objectives including equitable access, connection to places of strategic importance, and reliability. In particular, agencies
must decide whether to spread or concentrate service. In order to allocate service in a transparent
manner that maximizes total welfare, the effect of frequency on ridership should be quantified.
This effect may not be linear; Mohring (1972) points out that the cost experienced by passengers is
proportional to the headway, which is the inverse of frequency. Therefore each vehicle-trip added
to a route may not produce as much (or as little) ridership as the current route productivity, measured in passengers per vehicle-trip. The elasticity of ridership with respect to frequency measures
the percentage change in ridership resulting from a 1% increase in frequency. When this elasticity
is greater than one, adding more service increases the route productivity. Because this elasticity
measures the sensitivity of demand to frequency, it varies across routes based on frequency and
across stops based on local characteristics.
This paper presents a new method to scrub, process, and model ridership data over time and
space. Passenger counts are cross-checked with the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS), a
schedule meta-data standard. Passenger counts are then aggregated by route-segments (groups of
seven stops on the same route and direction) and combined with data sources on population and
jobs. The change in ridership is modeled over time through panel regression. Fixed-effects models
avoid unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity biases that plague cross-sectional models by using
each individual as its own control over time. Fixed-effects models therefore control for variation
between individual locations to capture the variation within each. In this paper, ridership is
modeled using Poisson fixed-effects, which was developed by Hausman et al. (1984) for count data
such as passenger boardings and alightings.
The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 organizes the main studies from the literature by level
of aggregation and identifies panel models of hyper-local ridership trends as the gap in research.
Section 3 presents the four case studies. Section 4 describes the process of cleaning, aggregating,
and combining multiple relevant datasets. In Section 5, the fixed-effects Poisson regression model
for ridership data is developed. Section 6 presents the modeling results. Section 7 discusses their
implications and identifies future research questions.
2. Literature Review
Ridership elasticity to frequency on a local-level and over time remains largely unaddressed in
the literature. Table 1 classifies the main studies on transit ridership by level of spatial aggregation
(rows) and whether the sample is observed once or at multiple time periods (columns). All the
references in the top row evaluate ridership at the transit agency or metropolitan area level. These
studies can help compare the impact of aggregated factors across regions, and for studies in the topright quadrant, across time. Many factors that explain ridership can vary widely between regions
and explain why ridership is greater in New York City than in Mobile, AL (Taylor et al., 2009). In
a study of 25 regions between 2002 and 2015, Boisjoly et al. (2018) found that the service quantity

is among the best predictors of ridership. This relationship, however, seems to have deteriorated
in recent years. Following nation-wide cuts in bus service between 2009 and 2012, bus ridership
kept falling even as vehicle revenue miles continually increased (Watkins et al., 2019). While these
studies shed light on the impact of overall operating expenses on overall ridership, the level of
aggregation may drown some of the local dynamics. For example, shifting resources from one route
to another can impact overall ridership without even affecting the total service provided. Likewise,
the local effects of population, jobs, and demographic factors are diluted in system-level studies.
The bottom left quadrant of Table 1 contains studies modeling bus ridership at a local level at
a single point in time. These studies capture the local variation between individual stops, routes,
or route-segments. These models are formulated as if each individual location was similar in every
aspect except for the variation captured by explanatory variables. In reality, individual locations are
different from each other in ways that cannot be measured and that may affect ridership. Ridership
itself is likely to affect frequency directly; when allocating service throughout the network, transit
planners strive to maximize ridership. Therefore, estimates for frequency, population, and jobs are
likely inflated by the two-way causality. While these estimates inform the relationship between
these variables at one point in time, they cannot serve as true elasticities.
The bottom right quadrant contains studies modeling bus ridership on a local level over time.
Results from Maloney et al. (1964) and Kyte et al. (1988) still serve as the main reference on
ridership elasticity to frequency (Evans et al., 2004; Litman, 2017). Following service changes in
Boston, MA, and Portland, OR, these studies computed separate ridership elasticities for each

3

route. With values ranging from zero to 3.77 (Kyte et al., 1988), route-specific elasticities are not
entirely meaningful.
Fixed-effects models harness the combined explanatory powers of all individual locations in the
panel to explain the change in ridership over time. Tang and Thakuriah (2012) and Brakewood
et al. (2015) use fixed-effects models at the route level to evaluate the impact of real-time passenger information on ridership. More recently Diab et al. (2020) modeled the impact of service
attributes on ridership between 2012 and 2017 in Montreal, QC. They find a positive correlation
with vehicle speed, number of stops, job accessibility, and several measures of service quantity, including frequency, a dummy variable for routes with headways less than 10 minutes, and a dummy
variable for the express network. Frei and Mahmassani (2013) and Kerkman et al. (2015) model
ridership change at the stop-level over a one year period. These studies apply a log-transform to
reduce the asymmetry in the ridership distribution. However, The magnitude of logged-variation
is typically far greater at low-ridership stops, which are correlated with explanatory variables by
design. In addition, zero-values in the original data must be either truncated or a constant must
be added to each observation, which can affect the distribution of variation and produce further
heteroskedasticity (King, 1988; Manning and Mullahy, 2001; Silva and Tenreyro, 2006).
Modeling ridership change at a disaggregated level is complicated by the missing data, endogeneity, and multiple levels of interaction. The models are highly sensitive to even slight misspecification.
This paper presents a framework to analyze the causes of ridership change on a disaggregated level.
A novel methodology to process, combine, and model passenger count data over multiple periods
is developed. The Poisson Fixed-Effects model for ridership analysis is introduced. This model is
specifically designed to reveal the sensitivity of ridership to frequency on a highly disaggregated
spatial and temporal scale without truncating or transforming of the data. Retrospectively, this
analysis can be used to control for frequency, and identify underlying trends based on a host of
other factors as in Berrebi and Watkins (2020b). More broadly, this study opens the door to a wide
range of research topics on the sensitivity of transit ridership.
3. Case Studies
To evaluate the relationship between transit ridership and frequency, four transit agencies were
selected due to the high quality of their APC data:
•
•
•
•

Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon (TriMet) in Portland OR
Miami-Dade Transit in Miami, FL
Metro Transit in Minneapolis/St-Paul, MN
Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) in Atlanta, GA

The study team initially approached transit agencies asking for historical Automatic Passenger
Count (APC) data going back as far as possible by markup, which is the period of schedule planning
(also known as pick, shakeup, or signup). Transit agencies typically have three markups per year,
4

spring, summer, and fall/winter. Since agencies started implementing APC technology at different
times, the range of available data varies. Table 2 shows the first and last markup for each agency.
Every markup in between was used in this analysis.

Table 3 shows the characteristics of the transit agencies and their metropolitan areas. Data
in the first two rows, 2018 bus ridership and hours of directly operated service 2 , come from the
National Transit Database (Federal Transit Administration, 2019). The last two rows of Table 3
show Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) population and percent of population living in dense
Census Tracts according to the 2016 American Community Survey (US Census Bureau, 2016).
Percent living in density is calculated as the share of metropolitan area population living in Census
Tracts with more than three housing units per gross acre, which corresponds to the density threshold
that can financially justify running transit service as calculated by Pushkarev and Zupan (1977).

The transit agencies in this study are similar in size but they vary widely in other aspects.
Ridership and revenue hours in each of the four agencies are all within 15% of each other. Dividing
passenger trips by revenue hours gives the productivity. TriMet is the most productive agency
with 28.5 passengers per revenue hour and MARTA is the least productive with 22.1 passengers
per revenue hour. While TriMet serves more passenger trips than Miami-Dade, the Miami region
has 2.5 times more population than the Portland area. The Miami region is the densest, followed
by Portland, Minneapolis/St-Paul, and Atlanta, where only 11% of the population lives at transitsupportive densities. The case-studies, therefore, represent a wide cross-section of mid-sized transit
agencies, forming a basis of comparison that can be useful to their peers.

was obtained
by averaging
sum of boardings and alightings across all weekday trips in the markup. Summing both boardings
13
and alightings is necessary to avoid the asymmetry problem: some stops, typically located near the
end of the line, are only ever used to alight buses. For example, 18% of stops in Minneapolis/StPaul have zero recorded boardings in fall 2012. In addition, all weekdays are pooled together, their
averages are based on sample sizes five times greater than Saturdays and Sundays. In order to
consider the most comprehensive dataset possible, we chose to focus on weekday ridership.
4.2. Identify Constant Stop-Route-Directions
In order to understand the relationship between the change in ridership and the change in
frequency, only stop-route-directions that remained constant over the entire study period were
considered. Any stop that was either added or removed between the first and the last markup was
disregarded. Table 4 shows the percentage of constant stop-route-directions in the last markup and
the ridership they represent. In Portland, Miami, and Minneapolis/St-Paul, the vast majority of
stop-route-directions were already there in the first markup. The share of stop-route-directions that
remained constant and the ridership they represent are close in all three agencies, which indicates
that they are somewhat representative of all stop-route-directions. In Atlanta, however, almost half
of all stop-route-directions in the last markup had been added since the first markup. The agency
underwent a comprehensive operational analysis in which many routes were altered. In any case,

the purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the sensitivity of ridership to frequency, not to explain
overall ridership change.
4.3. Comparison Between APC and GTFS
Passenger counts cannot be relied upon as the sole source of frequency data because trips are
commonly missing3 . Transit agencies usually purchase vehicles already equipped with APC. Older
vehicles, however, do not produce passenger counts. Even on new vehicles, APC units can go out
of service for weeks or months before getting repaired. The same bus is often scheduled to operate
a trip every day of the markup. If that vehicle is not equipped with a functioning APC, then the
trip will never be surveyed. Missing trips can introduce a bias. As older vehicles get rolled out
of the fleet, APC coverage increases over the years, which could be interpreted as an increase in
frequency.
To avoid this issue, the number of observed daily trips in APC was compared with the number of
scheduled trips for each stop-route direction. Historical schedule data published by transit agencies
in GTFS format were obtained from third-party websites 4 . The number of daily trips in APC and
GTFS was then compared. All segments with more than one missing trip in the first markup were
filtered out of the analysis entirely. Route-segments with more than one missing trip in subsequent
years are removed from the analysis only for the offending years. The sensitivity of the results to
missing trips is analyzed in Appendix A.
4.4. Route-Segments
While the main objective of this paper is to understand the relationship between frequency and
ridership, population and jobs also affect transit ridership on a local level. To extract meaningful
results, these variables should be measured on the scale of their variation. While the service
coverage area (i.e. accessible walking distance) for a bus stop is defined by the Transit Capacity
and Quality of Service with a

Fortunately, the passenger counts themselves are reliable. The four transit agencies have systems in place to
ensure that trips are not under-counted or over-counted. A study in TriMet from the late 1980s had already found
the APC data to be consistent with manual counts (Strathman and Hopper, 1989).

walkability, which is determined by connectivity, land-use patterns, quality of path, and context, on
which no data is available (Southworth, 2005). Therefore, what accounts for differences in ridership
between adjacent stops on the same route-direction is unlikely to be captured by our explanatory
variables. Modeling ridership at the stop-route-direction level would reduce explanatory power.
Furthermore, the passenger’s choice to use one stop over the next one introduces serial correlation,
which may affect estimated variances.
While minimizing the overlap between adjacent segments, it is also important to maintain locally
relevant and consistent units of spatial analysis. Segments must be short enough for the population
and jobs collected within a 1/4 mi radius to describe the potential demand on a local level. At the
same time, the consistency of route-segments is necessary for the comparison of ridership across
neighborhoods and metropolitan areas. To address these issues, we define route-segments, clusters
of seven adjacent stops on the same route-direction, as the spatial unit of analysis.
Route-segments are created using the stop sequence (i.e. order on the route) of constant stoproute-directions was obtained from GTFS. Since a stop can have different sequences on the same
route-direction across different trips, the stops, stop times, trips, and routes tables were joined and
the sequence index common to the most trips was recorded. Ultimately, each constant stop-routedirection combination was present in one and only one route-segment. Spatial coordinates for each
stop were also obtained from the GTFS stops table. Each route-direction was then divided into
segments of seven stops in sequential order. The last remaining stops at the end of each route
were merged with the upstream segment. Ridership and frequency were then averaged by segment
across stops.
4.5. Population and Jobs
Population and job data were obtained from Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD).
The LEHD are data products compiled by states using Unemployment Insurance earnings and published by the US Census Bureau. The number of jobs is provided at the Census Block level, by year.
These data, however, are only available between 2011 and 2015. We therefore linearly extrapolated
the LEHD data to match the APC time-frame. The underlying assumption is that population
and job trends between 2011 and 2015 continued their course until 2018 in Atlanta and until 2017
everywhere else. In other words, a Census Block that gained five residents per year until 2015 was
assumed to keep growing at the same rate.
The LEHD data were first cleaned and prepared for import into ArcMap. Block Group shapefiles
were joined using a common GEOID field. A dissolved

1
4

mi buffer was applied to the stops based

on the common route-segment field. This buffer was overlaid with LEHD data using a pairwise
intersection tool, which compares the input features of overlapping layers. Features common to both
input layers were sent to the output feature class. The output mirrors the geometric intersections
of the two layers while considering which layers they are derived from. Therefore, the overlapping
service coverage areas of bus stops within the same segment were only counted once. Note, however,

8

that service areas falling in the overlap of multiple segments were assigned to each of the segments.
Under the assumption that people and jobs are uniformly distributed within their geographic unit,
LEHD data were weighted by the proportion of each Census Block in the segment buffer.
Figure 2 shows a map in Portland, OR, illustrating LEHD workplace locations by route-segment
buffers, which are differentiated by color. Overlapping segment buffers hide each other and are
therefore not visible on the map. The length of each buffer varies considerably depending on the
stop density. Block Group boundaries are shown as thick dashed lines and Census Block boundaries
are shown as light gray lines. The small gaps in segment buffers represent the Census Blocks without
any job locations.

5. Model
5.1. Regression Structure
Ridership data is count data5 . These data violate the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) assumption
of normally distributed errors. While the Normal distribution is defined from -∞ to ∞ and has
constant variance, count data are necessarily non-negative and their variance grows with their
mean. Skewed data, however, can be transformed by taking the natural logarithm (log) to fit
5
The response variable in our model, sum of average weekday passenger boardings and alightings, is not discrete.
This is because transit agencies typically store stop-level ridership data as averages across entire markups (usually
three or four months). Some agencies do not record the number of vehicle-trips these averages are based on. Otherwise,
we could have multiplied average ridership by the number of vehicle-trips and treated the latter variable as the offset.
In any case, this does not affect the consistency of our model (Silva and Tenreyro, 2006).

OLS as long as they have constant variance-to-mean ratio (Nelder and Wedderburn, 1972). The
log-linear model for ridership is given in Equation (1). Variables are defined in Table 5.

log(Rid) = β0 + β1 log(Freq) + β2 log(Pop+Job) + 

(1)

In Equation (1), Freq and Pop + Job are logged. Logged variables are measures of exposure.
Their coefficients, β1 and β2 are elasticities. They explain the proportional change in ridership
resulting from the proportional change in explanatory variables. Here the number of residential
homes and job locations within

1
4

mi of bus stops are added to form a potential trip generation

variable.
Taking the exponent of both side sides of (1) yields the more intuitive formulation (2), in which,
explanatory variables have a multiplicative relationship. The model can be summarized as follows:
when a bus passes by a route-segment, each residential home and job has the potential to generate
a trip. This formulation is consistent with the literature: the effect of frequency on ridership is
dependent on population and jobs (Badoe and Miller, 2000). A route running through areas with
low population and few jobs is unlikely to attract ridership, even if it has high frequency. Conversely,
a route-segment passing through a high concentration of population and jobs still needs frequency
to attain high ridership.

Rid=eβ0 ∗ Freqβ1 ∗ (Pop+Job)β2 ∗ e

(2)

While the log-linear OLS regression of Equation (1) gives an estimate of E(log(Rid)), we are
primarily interested in log(E(Rid)). A model that estimates log(E(Rid)) directly and deals with
zero-values adequately is the Poisson regression. In the Poisson regression, the expected ridership
is estimated directly as per Equation (3) through Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The
vectors x and β represent the explanatory variables and their coefficients with the exception of the
intercept, β0 .

10

E(Rid|x) = eβ0 +βx

(3)

Given a (possibly non-linear) model specification, MLEs estimate the distribution parameters
that maximize the probability of obtaining the observed data. In our model, the Poisson regression
is computed with a robust covariance matrix (also known as quasi-Poisson regression) to relax the
assumption that the variance must equal the mean. The quasi-Poisson model returns the same
coefficients as the regular Poisson regression, but standard errors are better calibrated for potential
over-dispersion (Wooldridge, 2002, §19.2). Note that our standard errors may still be inflated due
to spatial correlation between route-segments. This effect, however, is limited by the clustering of
adjacent stops, which leaves little overlap between segments on the same route and direction.
Equation (4) shows the derivative of E(Rid|x) with respect to frequency. This derivative is
the expected ridership gained from adding a single vehicle-trip to the route-segment, henceforth
referred to as “marginal productivity”. In the original model, β1 is the elasticity of ridership to
frequency.

δE(Rid|x)
=β1 ∗ Freqβ1 −1 ∗ eβ0 ∗ (Pop+Job)β2
δFreq

(4)

In the derivative of Equation (4), we see that the marginal productivity is proportional to
Freqβ1 −1 . Therefore, when β1 > 1 (β1 < 1), then the marginal productivity is a monotone increasing
(decreasing) function of Freq, i.e. each additional trip yields increasing (decreasing) ridership
returns. Identifying the sign of (β1 − 1) can help inform the trade-off between service allocation
policies.
5.2. Fixed Effects
Let us consider the observed ridership, Ridit , on route-segment i and year t, where i ∈ {1, ..., n}
and t ∈ {1, ..., T }. The standard formulation for the fixed-effects model is shown in Equation (5).
The linear equation βx0it is the effect of explanatory variables xit . The terms αi represents the
individual specific effects, µ is a linear time trend, and it is the error.

log(Ridit ) = βx0it + αi + µt + it

(5)

The αi term allows each individual route-segment to have its own intercept, while the β terms
force the relationship between x0it and Ridit to be the same for all. The term µ represents the
linear effect of time, which is not explained by other variables. It takes into account conjunctural
phenomena that may be affecting all route-segments equally.

Similarly to the cross-sectional case in the last section, panel ridership data can be modeled with
a Poisson fixed effects model6 . As in Equation (3), the expected ridership is modeled as follows:

0

E[Ridit |xit ] = eβxit +αi +µt

(6)

The β parameters are estimated conditionally on the sum of outcomes at the individual level
over the years (Hausman et al., 1984). The resulting conditional likelihood is proportional to the
right-hand side of Equation (7) as per (Cameron and Trivedi, 1998, §9.3). Estimates are obtained
by setting the partial derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to beta to zero as in Equation
(8).

Notice that any constant added to the observed explanatory variables, xit , gets canceled out
in both equations. Therefore, only the variation taking place over time within each individual
route-segment is modeled. Any heterogeneity and endogeneity disappear as long as it does not
vary over time. Because spatial demand and the resulting allocation of service change at the pace
of land-use, we are not concerned about these effects over a five to six-year panel.
5.3. Isolating the Effects of Frequency Change on Ridership
Time-invariant explanatory variables cannot be considered in fixed-effects models. However,
some of the research questions raised in the introduction compel us to evaluate the relationship
between prior frequency (frequency at the beginning of the panel, when t = t0 ) and the change
in transit ridership. Time-invariant variables, in this case prior frequency, can be interacted with
time-varying variables, in the case frequency at time t. The Poisson fixed-effects model considered
in this paper is shown in Equation (9). Noticing that logs cancel their exponents, we obtain the
6

As in the cross-sectional case, the fixed-effects Poisson model assumes that the variance, V (Ridit |xi ), is equal
to its mean, E(Ridit |xi ). To relax this assumption, Hausman et al. (1984) introduced the fixed-effects NegativeBinomial model, which estimates a dispersion parameter. Like Hausman et al. (1984)’s Poisson fixed-effects, their
Negative Binomial fixed-effects model is conditioned on the sum of outcomes. This model, however, was shown to be
misspecified by Allison and Waterman (2002) and later in more detail by Guimaraes (2008). The Negative-Binomial
fixed-effects can also be estimated unconditionally (i.e. by fitting dummy variables, called incidental parameters, for
each individual except for one). However, there is, to the authors’ knowledge, no proof that it does not (or does)
cause an incidental parameter problem. In the unconditional Negative Binomial fixed-effects model, the incidental
parameter is not divided out. In cases, such as ours, where T is fixed and N is large, this parameter can be inconsistent
and bias the β estimates (Hsiao, 2003, §7.3). Fortunately, Wooldridge (1999) showed that the Poisson fixed-effects
estimates are robust to overdispersion.

Frequency (Freqit ), Population (Popit ), Jobs (Jobit ), and time (t) are time-varying, while prior
frequency is time-invariant (Freqit0 ). The interpretation of β1 is the elasticity of ridership to
frequency, as in the cross-section model. However, sensitivity is measured within individual routesegments instead of between. The second term is the interaction of the frequency at t = t0 with
the time-varying frequency. The coefficient β2 tells us whether ridership is more elastic to frequency
on frequent routes (positive) or on infrequent routes (negative). Finally, the fourth term, β3 , gives
the within elasticity to change in population and jobs.
Equation (10) can be used to predict how changing frequency on a route-segment would affect
ridership. However, this relationship is dependent on the individual-specific error, αi . This term is
divided out in Equation (11).

As in (4), taking the derivative of E[RidiT |xiT ] with respect to FreqiT yields the marginal
productivity. Unlike the elasticity, which measures the percentage change in ridership as a function
of percentage change in frequency, the marginal productivity measures the absolute change as a
function of the absolute change. When FreqiT = Freqit0 , the marginal productivity is:

Equation (12) enables schedule planners to anticipate the effects of service allocation policies
just by knowing the prior ridership and frequency. While the static E[Ridit0 |xit0 ] is modeled
in Subsection 6.1, using observed values of prior ridership, Ridit0 , instead allows to capture the
unobserved heterogeneity. This formulation enables planners to assess how much ridership will be
lost by removing one vehicle from a specific route and how much will be gained by adding it to a
different route.
6. Results
This section presents the results from the Poisson cross-section and fixed-effects models. These
models were run in the software program R using the stats and pglm packages, respectively (R
13

Core Team, 2017; Croissant, 2017).
6.1. Cross-Section
Table 6 shows the results of the cross-sectional model in the first markup (2012/2013/2014)
presented in Equation (2). McFadden’s pseudo-R2 is shown for each agency at the bottom of Table
6. In Portland, Miami, and Minneapolis/St-Paul, pseudo-R2 values close to one indicate a good
fit; less so in Atlanta. The first row, log(Freq) is the elasticity of ridership to frequency. For all
four agencies, elasticity is significantly greater than one, and hence elastic. In other words, for two
route-segments with the same population and jobs, the one with the greater frequency is likely
to have more passengers per trip. The second row shows the sensitivity of ridership to the total
population and jobs. In all four agencies, the parameter estimate is significantly below one. For
the same level of frequency, a segment surrounded by more development than another is expected
to have less ridership per capita when controlling for frequency. These results are consistent with a
meta-study from Aston et al. (2020a). Based on a review of 90 articles, the authors had concluded
that ridership was inelastic to population and job density. .

In order to verify the model results of Table 6, we need to represent the relationship between ridership and frequency in the first markup (2012/2013/2014) graphically. Figure 3 shows route-level
productivity in weekday passenger boardings per trip against frequency in daily trips. Productivity allows us to compare the ridership contribution of each vehicle-trip on routes with different
frequencies. The size of each dot corresponds to the number of stops on the route. One would
expect routes with more stops to connect more places, and therefore yield more passengers per
trip. Express routes in Minneapolis/St. Paul are excluded because their stop densities are so much
lower than the rest. A trend line is shown in red. The gray band represents its standard error.
Figure 3 provides a different lens to observe the same phenomenon identified in the crosssectional regression model. There is a clear positive relationship between productivity (in passenger
boardings per trip) and frequency (in number of daily trips) at one point in time. This trend is
strongest in Portland and Miami and weakest in Minneapolis. In all four agencies, frequent routes
14

carry more passengers per trip than lower frequency routes. These results are consistent with
Mohring (1972) who suggested that frequency should be set as the square root of ridership per
mile.
Since these routes concentrate the most service, slight changes in productivity can have a
disproportionate impact on overall ridership. If the high productivity of these frequent routes
could be maintained, increasing service would greatly benefit overall ridership. On the other hand,
transit agencies may want to add service for the specific purpose of reducing crowding

Figure 3: Route-level productivity in passenger boardings per stop per trip as a function of weekday frequency over
time in four metropolitan areas in the first markup (2012/2013/2014).

Both the cross-sectional model and the graphical representation show that, when comparing the
variation between route-segments or routes, productivity is positively correlated with frequency.
As discussed in the literature review, this does not necessarily mean that increasing frequency on a
route-segment will produce increasing returns. High-frequency segments may be more productive
due to unobserved heterogeneity or endogeneity. The effect of frequency change on ridership can,
therefore, only be tested by comparing the variation within each route-segment over time. The
next subsection does just that.

15

6.2. Fixed Effects
Table 7 shows the results of the Poisson fixed-effects model. For each agency, the elasticity
of ridership to frequency and to population and jobs is presented. In this model, the interaction
between frequency and prior frequency is omitted to enable a comparison with the cross-sectional
results. The log-likelihood, total number of observations, individual segments, and time periods
are shown at the bottom of the table. Unfortunately, there is no equivalent to the pseudo-R2 for
the fixed-effects Poisson model. However, the good fit of the cross-sectional models indicates that
the fixed-effects model is also well specified. Finally, note that the linear time trend is significantly
negative for all agencies. This indicates that, even when controlling for frequency, population, and
jobs, ridership is still declining over time.
The elasticity of ridership to frequency is far weaker in the fixed-effects model than in the crosssection. While the between elasticity in the previous model ranged from 1.21 to 1.50, the within
elasticity shown in Table 7 ranges from 0.66 to 0.78. For all agencies studied, ridership is inelastic
to frequency. In other words, each vehicle-trip added to a route-segment generates diminishing
productivity returns.

In order to represent the within elasticity of ridership to frequency graphically, we must add
the time dimension to our scatter plots. Figure 4 shows route-level productivity as a function
of frequency in the first markup (2012/2013/2014) in red and the last markup (2017/2018) in
blue. The slopes of the arrows linking the first markup and the last markup data points are
marginal productivity. There is clearly a trend pulling productivity down in all agencies, which
is not dependent on frequency change. However, if frequency had no impact on productivity
(i.e. elasticity = 1), then all routes would lose the same relative productivity. In all agencies,
routes in which frequency increased seemed to experience more relative decline in productivity
than expected and vice versa. This is particularly true in Portland, where long arrows pointing
towards the bottom-right contrast with short arrows spread in every direction.

16

Figure 4: Route level productivity in passenger boardings per stop per trip as a function of weekday frequency over
time in four metropolitan areas.

The trends in Figure 4 also show the connection between frequency change and prior frequency.
For example, in Portland, frequent routes gained frequency, perhaps in an attempt to combat
overcrowding, while in Miami, frequent routes lost the most frequency, perhaps in an attempt to
maintain coverage. Adding the interaction term between frequency and prior frequency can help
determine whether the elasticity differs between previously frequent and infrequent routes.
6.3. Sensitivity to Prior-Frequency
Table 8 shows the fixed-effects model results where frequency is interacted with prior frequency.
The log(Popit + Jobit ) and linear time coefficients are almost identical to the previous model. The
elasticity is the sum of its two first terms, β1 + β2 log(Freqit0 ). The estimate of β1 is far off from
the estimate in Table 7 because the term is not centered. Its interpretation should assume that
log(Freqit0 ) = 0, i.e. that Freqit0 = 1.
Figure 5 shows the elasticity of ridership to frequency as a function of prior frequency. Confidence bands of one standard deviation surround the estimated elasticity. Since the elasticity
term includes two components, one fixed, β1 , and one based on frequency in the first markup,
β2 log(Freqit0 ), the combined standard deviation was obtained using the Delta Method (Oehlert,
1992). In Portland, Miami, and Atlanta, elasticity is greatest on low-frequency routes, while in
Minneapolis/St-Paul elasticity is greatest on high-frequency routes. These results indicate that in
17

all agencies besides Minneapolis, each percentage increase in frequency will produce a greater percentage increase in ridership on routes that were previously infrequent than on routes that already
had high-frequency. The reason why Minneapolis deviates from its peers is possibly due to the
looser connection between frequency and productivity at one point in time exhibited in Figure 3. It
is likely that Metro Transit has historically invested in service coverage over concentration, thereby
maintaining some potential growth on the most frequent routes, which has been exhausted in other
agencies.

7. Conclusion and Future Research
This study reveals the relationship between bus ridership and frequency on a highly disaggregated level. In a cross-sectional analysis, we found that the most frequent routes at one point-in-time
are also the most productive (passengers per vehicle-trip) in all four transit agencies. This relationship, however, contains both the exogenous effect of ridership on frequency, which we are interested
in, and the reverse causality. Through decades of service planning, the bus network reflects the
spatial distribution of travel demand. To control for time-invariant endogeneity and other unobserved heterogeneity between route-segments, we developed a Poisson fixed-effects model, which
captures the variation in ridership within each route-segment over time. The results indicate that
the ridership elasticity to frequency ranges from 0.66 to 0.78 for all agencies. We also find that
in Portland, Miami, and Atlanta, the most frequent routes are the least elastic while the opposite
is true in Minneapolis/St-Paul. Overall, three broad conclusions can be drawn from the analysis
presented herein:
• The wide difference in estimated elasticity between the cross-section and fixed-effects models,
which accounts for the endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity, indicates that the demand
for bus service is more concentrated than the supply. As shown in the cross-sectional
analysis of Subsection 6.1, frequent routes serve more passengers per trip than lower-frequency
routes.
• For all agencies studied, ridership is inelastic to frequency, as shown in Subsection 6.2.
Therefore, each marginal trip added to a route will typically generate less ridership than the
average vehicle already on the route. In other words, the expected ridership returns from
frequency are diminishing.
• If transit agencies were to increase frequency on all routes by the same proportion, the
productivity advantage of frequent routes would decline in Portland, Miami, and Atlanta
and increase in Minneapolis/St-Paul as shown in Subsection 6.3.
The main limitation of this study is that we do not account for potential time-varying endogeneity. If transit planners readjusted service in response to the organic change in travel demand
between 2012 and 2018 that happened independently of service frequency, population, and jobs,
then elasticity estimates may be inflated in the fixed-effects models (Wooldridge, 2002, §9). We
expect, however, this time-varying endogeneity to be relatively small. Transit planners allocate
service through a process that involves stakeholders with conflicting objectives, including coverage,
access, and connectivity. The consensus emerging from this process is not always to adjust service
according to recent changes in travel demand. Even when planners do allocate service in response
to changes in demand, the potential time-varying endogeneity does not undermine the main conclusions of this paper. If anything, inflated elasticity estimates caused by time-varying endogeneity
would bolster our conclusion that ridership is inelastic to frequency.
19

Service allocation is by far the most important lever transit agencies have available to affect
ridership without changes in operating budgets. The results in this paper can be used to anticipate
the expected ridership change from cutting service on one route to prioritize another solely based
on prior frequency and ridership of both routes, as shown in Section 5.3. Specifically, the estimated
marginal ridership of each additional vehicle-trip can be obtained by simply multiplying a route’s
current productivity by its elasticity. Therefore, the insights unraveled in this study can serve as
inputs for travel demand models evaluating broader changes to the bus network. The results can
also support decisions to prioritize service coverage or concentration on a case by case basis to
attain the best possible compromise.
The service allocation problem consists in setting frequencies throughout the bus network with
the objective of minimizing a combination of waiting costs for passengers and operating costs for
the agency (Mohring, 1972). The method was extended by Furth and Wilson (1981) to consider the
societal benefit of transit ridership in the objective function based on elasticities from Mayworm
et al. (1980). More recent research has used ridership elasticity to frequency as an input parameter
(Verbas and Mahmassani, 2013). The optimal service allocation policy was found to be sensitive
to the assumed elasticity. The elasticities modeled in this paper can support these types of service
allocation optimization tools. Future research could take the relationship between elasticity and
prior frequency into account to attain even greater productivity.
The methodology applied to this problem for the first time can serve as a framework to support
future research in transit demand using observational data. While frequency is not the only factor
affecting ridership, it determines the feasibility, travel time, and reliability of transit trips. Several
studies had investigated how the change in service levels could explain changes in ridership over time
at the metropolitan area or transit agency level (Taylor et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2011; Boisjoly
et al., 2018; Watkins et al., 2019); others had explored the correlation between frequency and
ridership on a hyper-local level as a cross-section (Dill et al., 2013; Chakour and Eluru, 2016; Aston
et al., 2020b). For the first time, a Poisson Fixed-Effects model revealed the association between
the change in service frequency and bus ridership over time on a hyper-local level.
The model presented in this paper could be extended in future research to consider the ridership
impact of nearby service changes, from slight bus schedule adjustment to heavy rail station opening.
Future research should also explore the sensitivity of demand to service quantity by time-of-day
and day of the week. Knowing in which time-period ridership has declined the most could help
understand the underlying causes. Knowing when ridership is most elastic to frequency could lead
to service allocation strategies that can maximize ridership.
Several research questions remain unaddressed. In particular, service changes do not explain
the current nation-wide ridership crisis. The competition from other modes including dynamic
mobility companies may also affect the demand for buses on a local level. They may ultimately
explain the ridership change at the regional and national levels. But their effects are necessarily
lower order as they tend to drift slowly over time. Therefore, the elasticity to frequency is necessary

20

to understand the underlying causes of ridership change. The approach presented in this paper
will allow future research to understand the causes of ridership decline and identify strategies to
reverse the trend.

Appendix A. Missing Trip Sensitivity Analysis
The results of Section 6 are revisited in this Appendix based on the number of missing trips from
GTFS in APC. Figure A.6 shows (a) the sample size and (b) the estimated ridership elasticity to
frequency based on the maximum number of missing trips. In all four agencies, allowing segments
with missing trips in the analysis marginally increases the same size and causes slight fluctuations
in the elasticity coefficient estimate.
