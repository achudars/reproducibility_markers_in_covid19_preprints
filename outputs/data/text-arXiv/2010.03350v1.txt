Abstract
A Higher Order Markovian (HOM) model to capture the dynamics of commodity prices is proposed as
an alternative to a Markovian model. In particular, the order of the former model, is taken to be the delay,
in the response of the industry, to the market information. This is then empirically analyzed for the prices of
Copper Mini and four other bases metals, namely Aluminum, Lead, Nickel and Zinc, in the Indian commodities
market. In case of Copper Mini, the usage of the HOM approach consistently offer improvement, over the
Markovian approach, in terms of the errors in forecasting. Similar trends were observed for the other base
metals considered, with the exception of Aluminum, which can be attributed the volatility in the Asian market
during the COVID-19 outbreak.

I NTRODUCTION

In [1], Wets and Rios introduced a novel methodological approach to account for the distinct features of short
term regimes via-a-vis the long term regimes. More specifically, a drift term was taken into consideration in case
of the former, while recognizing that in case of the latter, the process is assumed to be drift-less, due to the volatile
nature of the process of commodity prices in the long term, resulting in a mean-reverting process being ruled out
for modeling of long term dynamics. Further, it was identified that the drivers of the short term process, in addition
to historical data, also takes into consideration the aspects of state of the market as a whole. The proposed setup
was then empirically analyzed in the context of copper prices, while recognizing the feasibility of the same in
case of other commodities. The authors, recognizing that the transition from the short term to long term process,
leading upto the ”global” setup is non-trivial, carried out the same through empirical data analysis. Further, they
cited existing literature to surmise that the long-term dynamics is triggered typically between the third and fourth
year of the period under consideration. Accordingly, the global process was modeled using a linear combination
of the short term and the long term processes. In our work, we adopt a mean reversal model for the long term
process (after [1]).
In [2], Schwartz and Smith, developed a two factor model for commodity prices to capture two things, namely,
the mean-reversion behavior of the short-term dynamics, and the uncertainly in the equilibrium levels of the prices,
resulting from mean-reversion. These two factors were then collated to model the dynamics for the spot prices
of the commodities. While estimation of the equilibrium price levels can be estimated from price movement

of commodity futures with long maturity, the short-term behavior of the prices can be inferred from the price
difference between short term and long term futures, and the model was validated using the prices of oil futures.
In a detailed study [3], Hilliard and Reis, investigated the impact of stochastic yields and interest rates, along with
jumps in spot price, in the pricing of commodity derivatives. In particular, the authors modeled the spot prices as
a jump-diffusion process, and also an equilibrium convenience yield diffusion. A two factor model was used for
valuation of futures and options. This was then extended for three factors, as well as three factor jump-diffusion
valuation model. In the context of our work, one of the assumptions in [3], is that the net marginal rate of yield
of the commodity follows a mean-reverting process. In [4], the authors presented logarithmic mean reversion
models for commodity pricing. Schwartz [5], presented a comparative analysis for three stochastic models for
commodity prices, by considering a mean-reversion process, in the paradigm of predictive modeling of futures
prices, as well as their valuation vis-a-vis, other derivatives and assets. The comprehensive analysis undertaken in
the paper, gave credence to the premise that there exists a strong mean reversion factor when it comes to pricing of
commodities. Hart et al. [6] attributed the lack of existence of options on agricultural commodities, with maturity
exceeding a year, to the lack of option pricing mechanism, in case of commodities, whose spot prices can be
encapsulated by a mean-reversion process. Accordingly, they proposed and analyzed a model to account for the
mean-reversion in the spot prices, and the model also corrected for seasonal influences, motivated by the empirical
observance of both mean-reversion and seasonal influence, in case of price dynamics in soybean markets. In [7],
Bernard et al. carried out a detailed comparative analysis of several approaches, namely, GARCH, jump-diffusion
and mean reversion, to forecast commodity prices. The empirical analysis carried out making use of spot prices
of aluminum and futures price series, produced mixed results, that is, no clear uniform dominance of any model,
could be established.

M ODEL AND M ETHODS

It is important to take note of the fact that all the above models cited from literature are Markovian, wherein the
instantaneous drift term is a function of the instantaneous or spot price. However, in the context of our discussion
is would be more realistic to account for the fact that, in the case of metals or other heavy industries, the industry
takes time to adjust to the market information, namely, demand and supply. This motivated the consideration of a
time lag factor, i.e., the instantaneous drift term will be a function of the price of the commodity at some earlier
time point. Accordingly, we propose our Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE), to model the instantaneous price
x(t) of the commodity, at time t, as,
dx(t) = a(t) (b(t) − x(t − τ )) dt + σ(t)2 x(t)dw(t),

(2.1)

where, a(t) is the drift, b(t) is the mean-inversion level, τ is the response time, σ(t) is the volatility and w(t)
is a Wiener process. The two key aspects of our model is that unlike the other models, this SDE can neither be
analytically solved, nor is it Markovian. In fact, it is a Higher Order Markovian (HOM) model of order τ [8].
Note that the Markovian analogue of equation (2.1), is given [1] by
dx(t) = a(t) (b(t) − x(t)) dt + σ(t)2 x(t)dw(t),

(2.2)

Economic theory suggests that, if there are changes in the prices of a commodity due to the volatility of the
markets, the industry will respond to that accordingly. For instance if there’s a sharp rise in prices, the profitability
of the commodity, increases, which gives the industry an incentive to increase the supply, which subsequently
reduces the prices. Similarly, if there is a fall in the prices, the profitability reduces and it is likely that the industry
will reduce supply, and thus prices would increase.
However for most of the industries, like that of base metals, it is unlikely that producers will bring changes in
production immediately, as a response to the market information. It is more likely that the industry will respond
2

with a delay to the market information. This response time (τ ) serves as the order of our HOM process. Another
significant advantage of a HOM model is that the speed of inversion is significantly lower than a Markovian
model. This implies that the price can drop significantly below the mean. In fact, it also allows for negative prices
of commodities (an example of which is, when the WTI May contract was in the negative zone, on 20th April,
2020).
We determine the long term mean of the SDE described in equation (2.1). Let x(t) be the mean of x(t) as
t → ∞ and let ∆t be a small interval, in which the price of the commodity increases by ∆x, in that interval.
Therefore,
tx(t) + ∆t(x + ∆x)
x(t + ∆t) =
.
t + ∆t
But, since t >> ∆t, therefore,
x(t + ∆t) = x(t),
(2.3)
Taking the expectation of equation (2.1), we obtain,
dhx(t)i = ha(t)ihb(t)i dt − ha(t)ihx(t − τ )i dt + σ 2 hxihdw(t)i,
which implies that
dhx(t)i
= ha(t)ihb(t)i − ha(t)ix.
dt
dhx(t)i
= 0. Therefore, as t → ∞,
From equation (2.3), we know that
dt
x = hb(t)i

(2.4)

At this point, we note that this result is useful while estimating parameters.
For the numerical analysis of the Copper Mini prices, we assume a(t), b(t) and σ(t) to be constants. However,
over longer periods, more realistic estimates can be made by treating them as functions of time, like accounting for
inflation in b. The parameter estimation was executed using the Euler-Maruyama Maximum Likelihood Analysis
[9, 10]. We can use Maximum-Likelihood estimation as a HOM Process, which is the solution of the FokkerPlanck equation, and is stated as the following Theorem, the Proof of which is given in Appendix A.
Theorem 1. For a Higher Order Markov process z, of order τ , that takes initial values of the function f defined
over an interval [t0 , t0 + τ ], z satisfies the following equation

In order to estimate the parameters of the model, we first exclude a fraction of the historical data to accommodate the time lag proposed in our model. After this, we set aside the initial 80% of the remaining data points
for the training part of the implementation, with the final 20% being used in the validation part of the implementation. Initially, an approximate estimation of the model parameters a and τ is obtained using a trial and error
approach. Further, the estimation of b is taken to be the mean of the spot prices of the training data set, from
equation (2.4). Finally, in order to estimate the value of σ, we start with an initial guess of σ = Std.Dev (ln(X)),
where the random variable X takes the values of the spot prices of the training data set. After we have obtained
an approximate estimate of the four parameters (as explained in the preceding discussion), we then worked on
3

obtaining a more accurate estimation of the parameters, through the implementation of a coordinate descent algorithm. At this point, we note that instead of a coordinate descent of the loss function, we employ a coordinate
ascent of the log-likelihood function, which is simply a maximization algorithm [11]. In the final step, we then
forecast the prices for the remaining 20% of the data points, time by simulations (using Monte-Carlo simulation)
and then average them out to obtain a mean path, and then compare the results obtained using our model, to that
of the Markovian models. The full algorithm for parameter estimation and forecasting is given in Appendix B.

R ESULTS

The primary focus of this article is the Copper Mini prices in India, in addition of a few other base metals,
namely, Aluminum, Lead, Nickel and Zinc. The emphasis on Copper Mini prices was due to the availability of a
reasonably sized data set. For the remaining metals, the choice was based on the liquidity and the availability of
data, albeit to a much lesser level than Copper Mini.

For the purpose of empirical analysis reported in this paper, we made use of the available spot prices from
the website of MCX-India [12]. We focus our analysis on Copper Mini for the following tabulated period (Table

initial 80%, and the final 20%, of the remaining data points were used for the training part, and the validation
part, respectively, of the implementation. The estimated order of the HOM Process for Copper Mini is tabulated
in Table 2. We now compare our proposed HOM model (2.1) with the Markovian model in equation (2.2) for the

of the enumerated approaches for the estimation of errors is presented in Table 3, wherein, it can be observed
that, in all the five approaches, the errors in estimation is consistently and significantly lower in case of the HOM

and the Markovian models, as can be seen in Figure 1.

We also analyze the probability distribution of the spot prices at a given time point. Accordingly, we test
the null hypothesis that the probability distribution of the spot prices at a given time is log-normal. We use the
Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test and the Anderson Darling test on an ensemble of 2000 simulations of the Copper Mini
spot price using the HOM model for different time steps, which are presented in Table 4 and 5, respectively. We
can see that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected for the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test or the Anderson-Darling
test for any of the time intervals. We also plot the log-distributions at the t = 210 days (the choice being for

For the estimation of errors, we have excluded the period wherein the prices of the commodities were frozen as
the market was not operational due to the lock-down. We can see that the HOM model gives better estimations of
the mean price of the path, than the Markov model, in all cases, except that of Aluminum. The error in Aluminum
may have been caused by the increased volatility in Asian markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic that could
not be accounted for as our parameters were estimated in the pre COVID-19 period [14]. It is also likely that
the estimation would improve if we could have access to more data and estimate a better response time as that
would allow for the estimation of a bigger time, which we have been unable to do due to unavailability of data.
However, it is interesting to note that the models make accurate predictions about the price of the commodity by
August 2020, by the time the market had reopened. The rise of the price of Aluminum above the model prediction
is also probably a consequence of the lock-down as well, and can be explained by pent up demand in the market
following the lock-down.

C ONCLUSION

The main contribution of this work is the presentation of our approach to the modeling of commodity prices,
using the Higher Order Markovian method, as an improved alternative to the Markovian model. We show, using
historical data of spot prices, that one achieves a better prediction of the spot prices of base metals in the Indian
market (in all cases studied except that of Aluminium), by factoring in the response time of the industry to
respond to market information, which is the order of the Higher Order Markov Process. Our analysis revealed
three advantages, namely, encapsulating the delay in the response of various base metal industries to the market
information, improving the predicted rate of long-term mean reversion, and reducing the error of estimation,
therefore providing better predicting power as compared to the Markovian model.
