Abstract—COVID-19 which has spread in Iran from February
19, 2020, has infected 202,584 people and killed 9,507 people until
June 20, 2020. The immediate suggested solution to prevent the
spread of this virus was to avoid traveling around. In this study, the
correlation between traveling between cities with new confirmed
cases of COVID-19 in Iran is demonstrated. The data, used in the
study, consisted of the daily inter-state traffic, air traffic data, and
daily new COVID-19 confirmed cases. The data is used to train a …
model and … voting was used to show the highest correlation
between travels made between cities and new cases of COVID-19.
Although the available data was very coarse and there was no detail
of inner-city commute, an accuracy of …% was achieved showing a
positive correlation between the number of inter-state travels and
the new cases of COVID-19. Consequently, the result suggests that
one of the best ways to avoid the spread of the virus is limiting or
eliminating traveling around.
Keywords—COVID-19; correlation; predict virus prevalence;

INTRODUCTION

In the last days of December 2019, a new virus was detected in
Wuhan, one of the most important historical and commercial
cities of China. The virus which was named COVID-19 by the
World Health Organization (WHO) [1], spreads rapidly through
all over the world and poses major threats to human health and
causing many deaths [2]. COVID-19 virus’s most common
symptoms are fever, cough, and headache. Furthermore, most
patients develop severe lung infections which cause frailty in vital
human organs [3]-[4]. The virus spreads through aerosols and
infected surfaces. Unfortunately, at the moment no effective
medication or vaccines have been found for the virus.
The high speed of the spread of COVID-19 has been a matter
of concern for governments and people as the fatality rate grows
every day. That is why the WHO emergency committee
announced an outbreak [5] and many countries, such as Italy [6]
and Spain [7], announced nationwide lockdowns to avoid the
spread of the virus. This is because the reduction in the amount of
traffic and human accumulation may be an effective way to break
the transmission chain of the coronavirus [8]. Unfortunately,
some countries are that are not financially strong to accept
widespread lockdown [9]. On the other hand, some people do not

consider the virus a serious threat and continue to travel around
[10].
Many studies have been done to provide algorithms for
various viruses’ prevalence methods or anticipate disease spread
rate. As an example, Hiba Asri seeks to predict the risk of breast
cancer and its diagnosis by using machine learning algorithms
such as Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and k Nearest Neighbors
[34]. Also, the study [35] is focused on the prediction of influenza
via an attention-based recurrent neural network. Besides, in
particular, many researchers have started forecasting COVID-19
prevalence. For instance, Rustam et. al [13] predict the number of
upcoming patients affected by COVID-19 using the number of
new cases, the number of deaths, and the number of recoveries in
countries all over the world. Wu and Leung [14] used the SEIR
model to nowcasting the potential domestic and international
spread of the COVID-19.
In Iran, the first cases of COVID-19 were found on February
19th a day before one of the most important elections in Iran and
a month to Iranians new year ceremony [11]. For this reason,
despite the official announcement of the corona outbreak, traffic
all over the country was increased. Therefore, the government
imposed partial lock-down, in which schools, universities, holly
shrines, and shopping centers were closed [12].
Unfortunately, there are still people who do not consider the
spread of the virus seriously and travel around. Consequently, to
better inform the public and give a scientific analysis of the
importance of social distancing and avoiding unnecessary travels,
in this paper, we demonstrate the relation between travels and
COVID-19 spread mathematically using machine learning
algorithms [12].
Our study focuses on the available public data including the
vehicle movement between cities and air travel information.
Although the data is very coarse and it is hard to get details,
however, it shows the correlation between the number of travels
made between the cities and new confirmed cases of COVID-19.
The available data includes the number of cars traveled in five
classes, the total passed cars and the number of flights and
passengers for domestic and international travels done each day.
Models are trained using car traffic data set made available by the
road management center of Iran [15], air flight traffic data set

provided by the Iranian's airports and air navigation office [16]
and COVID-19 daily new cases which are officially provided by
the Iranian ministry of health, updated by John Hopkins
University [17].

DATASETS AND METHODS

availability and medical advancement contribute to increasing or
decreasing these rates which were inaccessible and nearly
impossible to mathematically models all of these related features.
Daily new cases and daily death graphs are shown in Fig. 1 and
Fig. 2.

A. Dataset
The dataset used in this article consists of three main parts of
the data, including traffic of 5 cars' classes on the country's
suburban, the number of passengers transported by airplanes, and
official statistics on the number of corona new cases, deaths, and
active cases. These data have been recorded daily since February
19, 2020, which was the first day of the official announcement of
the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran [11], until June 20, 2020. Data
samples from the dataset are shown in Table 1.
1) Cars Dataset: Cars dataset consisted of 7 columns
including the frequency of 5 classes of cars, total cars, and
estimated total cars which passed a certain highway or freeway
between every two states in Iran. The five classes of cars are
defined with 5 numbers respectively as class 1) passenger and
pick up cars, class 2) minibus and small trucks, class 3) 3-axle
trucks lower than 10 meters, class 4) buses, and class 5) big
vehicles like trucks. The total number of cars is the sum of these
5 classes of cars. According to [15] the accuracy of road
surveillance cameras which were used to calculate the passing
cars is 90-95% percent so and a supplementary column was
combined with the name of total cars that handles the error and is
provided by [15].
Unfortunately, there are instances in which cameras could
not record the whole 24 hours. Consequently, to fill out this
missing data linear interpolation [18] had been used and
outliners were extrapolated using linear interpolation of other
days in the same month. This approach resulted in better
accuracy than filling the missing data with the mean of other
days.
2) Air Dataset: To more accurately study the impact of travel
on the prevalence of corona, it is necessary to examine the data
related to flights and domestic and foreign passengers transported
through this route. These data are provided by Iran Airport and
Air Navigation Company [16] on a monthly basis. Due to the
unavailability of data on a daily basis, the monthly data were
multiplied by the average distribution of flights in the statistical
data during the week and placed in the final data set. The main
data set consists of six columns that represent the number of
domestic, international, and he total number of passengers and the
number of flights in each category.
3) COVID-19 Dataset: COVID-19 dataset was prepared by
John Hopkins university available in [17] which has official Iran’s
COVID-19 statistics including total cases, new cases, total deaths,
new deaths, total recovered, and active cases. In particular, this
survey has focused on the number of new cases since COVID-19
officially announced in Iran [11]. Recovered and mortality rate
had been removed since many other factors such as medical

Figure 1. Daily new cases of COVID-19 in Iran since Feb. 19

Figure 2. Daily new cases of COVID-19 in Iran since Feb. 19

It can be seen in Fig. 2 that death trend is a little different as
other health factors are contributing. The daily active case in
John Hopkins COVID-19 dataset is the number of patients who
had not faced an outcome (recovered or dead) yet and are still in
progress of curing, so by removing this feature, a more valid
perception of the influence of traveling on COVID-19 spread can
be attained.
B. Supervised Machin Learning Model
To interpret the correlation between confirmed new cases of
COVID-19, supervised machine learning technique has been
chosen, due to the small dataset, neural network approaches like
LSTM failed to achieve reasonable forecasting as it was overfitted
and produce the same result (mean of outputs) for all consequent
days and, convolution networks needed larger dataset to reach the
same accuracy of machine learning models, thus, a regression
model was implemented to predict the number of daily new cases
of COVID-19 more precisely for both the training and validating
datasets [19].

Three regression models along with one ensemble regression
model used in a voting technique as the output decision maker
which Are going to be introduced in following sections.
regression models are:
•

Linear Regression

•

LASSO Regression

•

KNN Regression

•

Random Forest

which then all are used in an ensemble model:
•

Voting Regression

1) Linear Regression: Linear regression is the most utilizable
regression model used in machine learning for statistical
technique. This method demonstrates the relationship between a
scalar response and one or more explanatory variables which in
the case of multiple explanatory variables it is called multiple
linear regression [20]. Thus, the model takes from:
𝑓𝑓(𝑥𝑥) = 𝑤𝑤0 + 𝑤𝑤1 𝑥𝑥1 + 𝑤𝑤2 𝑥𝑥2 + ⋯ + 𝑤𝑤3 𝑥𝑥3
𝑑𝑑

= 𝑤𝑤0 + � 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗

(1)

𝑗𝑗=1

In which w is called the weights vector and w0 is the bias of
the regression model. The goal of this method is to fit the best
regression line by finding the best values of weights. To get the
best-fitted line, error term should be minimized which measures
how much predictions deviate from the desired answers and it is
calculated from:
𝐽𝐽𝑛𝑛 =

1
1
2
� �𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 − 𝑓𝑓(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 )� =
� (𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 − 𝑤𝑤 𝑇𝑇 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 )2 (2)
𝑛𝑛
𝑛𝑛

Here Jn is called the cost function which is the root mean
square of the calculated output and desired result and n is the total
number of data points [21].
2) Lasso Regression: LASSO or least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator is also a regression model that is formulated for
linear regression in which shrinkage [22] is the reduction in the
effect of sampling variation to results better for unseen data and
to prevent overfitting [22]. LASSO performs L1 regularization,
adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of the
coefficient which can effectively reduce the number of features
upon which the given solution is dependent. The function to
minimize is:

𝑤𝑤

3) Knn Regression: KNN or K nearest neighbors is a simple
algorithm that stores all available cases and predicts the numerical
target based on a similarity measure, this means that the new point
is assigned a value based on how closely it resembles the points
in the training set, which can be used in both regression and
classification problem [24].
There are several different similarity functions used in KNN
but here we used “Minkowski” and is defined as:
𝑘𝑘

‖𝑋𝑋𝑤𝑤 − 𝑦𝑦‖22 + 𝒶𝒶‖𝜔𝜔‖1

(�(|𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 − 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 |)𝑞𝑞 )𝑞𝑞
𝑖𝑖=1

Where q > 0. This is a general distance function, if q = 2, the
distance becomes Euclidean, and if q = 1 it becomes Manhattan
distance.

perform uniformly so any point from the training dataset will
impact the value assigned to test points [24].
4) Random Forest Regression: Random forests or random
decision forests are an ensemble learning method which is a way
of averaging multiple deep decision trees, trained on different
parts of the same training data, intending to reduce the variance
which can boost the performance [25]. This method is called
bootstrap aggregating [26].

𝑖𝑖=1,…,𝑛𝑛

𝑖𝑖=1,…,𝑛𝑛

Where x is the input regressor vector, and y is the
corresponding output and n is the number of samples from the
input so LASSO solves the minimization of the least square
penalty with 𝛼𝛼 × 𝜔𝜔 added, where 𝛼𝛼 is constant and 𝜔𝜔 is the ℓ1 −
𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 of coefficient vector. LASSO will be trained to find the
best-fitted coefficient to solve the linear regression. Different
algorithms have been used for LASSO to fit the values, here
coordinate descent has been used for this purpose as it is described
in [23].

𝑓𝑓̂ =

(5)

𝑏𝑏=1

Where B is the number of trees used in the random forest. 50
trees had been used for finding a correlation between travels and
COVID-19 new cases.
5) Voting Regression: Voting regressor is an ensemble metaestimator that fits several base regressors, each on the whole
dataset. Then it averages the individual predictions to form a final
prediction. It is a technique that can be used to achieve better
performance than any single model used in the ensemble by
offering lower variance in the predictions made over individual
models. One limitation that voting has is that it treats all models
the same, meaning all models contribute equally to the prediction,
this can happen when some models are efficient in some
situations [27].

Particularly in this study, voting was used with 4 individual
estimators that have been introduced in past sections which were
linear regression, LASSO regression, KNN regression, and
random forest regression. After evaluation as voting performed
better than any individual predictor, it was used to predict
COVID-19 new cases as the main model.
C. Evaluation Parameters
The performance of the learning model is evaluated in terms
of R-squared (R2) score, mean square error (MSE), mean absolute
error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE).
1) R-squared Score: It is the proportion of the variance in the
dependent variable that is predictable from the independent
variable and provides a measure of how well-observed outcomes
are replicated by the model, based on the proportion of total
variation of outcomes explained by the model [28]. It is calculated
as:
𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 = �(𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 − 𝑦𝑦�)2

(6)

𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 = �(𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 − 𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖 )2

(7)

𝑖𝑖

𝑖𝑖

𝑅𝑅2 ≡ 1 −

𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟
𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡

(8)

𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 is the total sum of squared, and 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 is the sum of
squares of residuals. As it indicates a model performance
reasonably well, it is the main metric for evaluation between
different models.
2) MSE: Another metric to evaluate performance is mean
square error [27] and it measures the average of the squares of the
errors that is the average squared difference between the
estimated value and the actual value in which indicates the quality
of an estimator and is computed as:

𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 =

𝑛𝑛

1
�(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 − 𝑌𝑌�𝑖𝑖 )2
𝑛𝑛

(9)

𝑖𝑖=1

3) MAE: Mean absolute error is a measure of errors between
paired observations expressing the same phenomenon. [29] it
cannot be used to make comparisons between series using
different scales and is a common measure in forecasting [30].
Formula is:
𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 =

∑𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖=1|𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 − 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 |
∑𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖=1|𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖 |
=
𝑛𝑛
𝑛𝑛

(10)

4) RMSE: Root mean square deviation or root mean square
error represents the square root of the second sample moment of
the differences between predicted values and observed values or
the quadratic mean of these differences [29]-[30]. It can be
calculated as:

𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 = �

∑𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖=1(𝑦𝑦�𝑡𝑡 − 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 )2
𝑇𝑇

(11)

5) CV score: Cross-validation score is a model validation
technique for assessing how the result of a statistical analysis will
generalize to an independent data set [31]. It is a method to avoid
overfitting of the model, in this method, the dataset divided
several subsamples, and each time model trained on the training
sample and validated on the test sample for a limited iteration,
then the score is calculated as the mean of the difference between
MSE of training subset and the expected MSE value for testing
subsample [32].
D. COVID-19 DISEASE
According to the World Health Organization’s researches, the
time between infected by COVID-19 and symptom onset which
is called the incubation period is about 5-6 days [33]. Moreover,
it takes a few days after significant symptoms develop to take the
COVID-19 test to ensure definite infection with the virus.
The graphs of the COVID-19 new cases, air passengers and,
car traffic can be seen in Fig. 3, which shows the offset between
extremum points of COVID-19 new cases and air passengers and
car traffic graphs.
To investigate the best average offset to model the period, the
new confirmed cases figure was moved along the date axis to
determine the efficient offset and more accuracy of the correlation
in the model.
As it is shown in Fig. 4, about 8 days offset matches most of
the graphs’ extremums and causes the best accuracy of the
correlation.

EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS

Voting regression was chosen as main predictor in which linear,
LASSO, KNN, and random forest regressors are its estimators.
Model was fitted on 80% records of dataset (training set) and was
validated on 20% records of dataset (validating set) and then
evaluated by some important metrices.
Results of evaluation metrics and prediction plots for the
training dataset and testing dataset are presented in Table I.

Three different deductions are derived from this experiment
which will be explained:
1) Correlation between travels and COVID-19 new cases: It
is determined, the correlation between the number of travelers and
confirmed new cases of COVID-19 is linear so social distancing
and total lockdowns can be 2 efficient ways for governments to
decreases the slope of affected people. Furthermore, previous
studies about COVID-19 disease have revealed that it took 3-5
days before symptoms appear and about 3-5 days until a person
take a test, thus, an average of 8 days shift was considered to
achieve more realistic result. Accordingly, it also showed a better
accuracy in predicting the number of confirmed cases. As can be
seen in the figure below.

urban and air traffic with the number of COVID-19 new cases in
Iran. It is shown that the increase in between cities transportation
and the reduction of restrictions by the Iranian government have
significantly increased the incidence of this deadly virus. The
importance of this study is that despite lack of detailed
information about the transportation in Iran, a general correlation
between the spread of COVID-19 and national human
transportation can be found. In the future, to improve the accuracy
of the forecast, the impact of intra-city transportation and the use
of public transport such as subways and buses on the prevalence
of the virus will be investigated.
Figure 7. Correlation between travels and COVID-19

There was a lockdown in day 40 so the air flights and car
travels decreased to its minimum peak which outcomes in
decreasing slope of COVID-19 new cases and just after the end
of lockdowns, the number of flights and car travels started to rise
which results in the growth of infected people. In the third month
(2 months after lockdowns) the number of air flights touches its
maximum peak as well as a rise in car travels which makes the
number of COVID-19 new cases reach its peak. Flight travels
have more influence on spreads of the disease as there are more
people exposed to getting the disease, so when flights number
overtake its maximum, COVID-19 confirmed cases rises.
As can be seen, the initial peak of COVID-19 new cases was
not because of the travels, the cause for this is the lack of railway
travels statics which was not available to access. Another reason
for this incompatibility is the incorrectness of confirmed new
cases of COVID-19 which was officially announced.
2) Covid-19 new cases prediction: As this study, modeled a
supervised regression problem to study effect of travels to new
cases of COVID-19, it can efficiently predict confirmed new
cases of COVID-19 concerning the number of travels which
mean if number of car travels and flights number is available,
modeled regression can predict the number of new cases with
85% accuracy which is considered well to do future analyses
about the COVID-19 pandemic.
IV.

CONCLUSION

The rapid spread of COVID-19 is a great danger to the
international community. Thus, many studies have been
conducted to find the ways to prevent outbreak. In this study, the
effect of urban traffic and air traffic, including the number of
passengers transferred and the number of flights, on the new cases
of COVID-19 has been investigated. Dataset was analyzed using
machine learning regression models such as Linear Regression,
LASSO Regression, KNN Regression and Random Forest which
are used in hard voting ensemble model as the output decision
maker. In addition, a period of 8 days has been found as the offset
between infection and definitive confirmation of the virus using
standard COVID-19 test since more accurate evaluation results
were attained. The result shows a direct relationship between
