Abstract

We construct a novel database containing hundreds of thousands geotagged messages related to the COVID-19 pandemic sent on Twitter. We create a daily index of
social distancing – at the state level – to capture social distancing beliefs by analyzing
the number of tweets containing keywords such as ”stay home”, ”stay safe”, ”wear
mask”, ”wash hands” and ”social distancing”. We find that an increase in the Twitter
index of social distancing on day t-1 is associated with a decrease in mobility on day
t. We also find that state orders, an increase in the number of COVID cases, precipitation and temperature contribute to reducing human mobility. Republican states
are also less likely to enforce social distancing. Beliefs shared on social networks could
both reveal the behavior of individuals and influence the behavior of others. Our findings suggest that policy makers can use geotagged Twitter data – in conjunction with
mobility data – to better understand individual voluntary social distancing actions.

Introduction
Social distancing policies reduce social interactions and ultimately COVID-19 infections.

Epidemiologists such as Ferguson et al. (2020) estimate that the implementation of social
distancing – including case isolation, household quarantine and school and workplace closures
– could halve the number of deaths in the United Kingdom and the United States. A
growing body of literature has linked policy interventions with social distancing (Abouk
and Heydari, 2020; Gupta et al., 2020; Chernozhukov et al., 2020) and the latter with the
spread of contamination (Kapoor et al., 2020; Chernozhukov et al., 2020; Yilmazkuday, 2020).
While evidence shows that government interventions decrease the size of the pandemic and
redistribute the number of cases over time, little empirical research has explored the impact
of beliefs on social distancing (Allcott et al., 2020).
In this paper, we contribute to the emerging literature studying differences in social
distancing across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. We proxy for the
beliefs of agents by creating a Twitter index of social distancing based on geotagged tweets
posted between February and June 2020. Twitter-based measures (Moore et al., 2019) –
like newspaper-based measures (Altig et al., 2020) or Google search trends (Brodeur et al.,
2020) – are considered good proxies for the perceptions and feelings of households. Moreover,
collecting tweets avoids the small-sample biases that can be found in most studies based on
questionnaires. Previous work using social network data shows that they successfully predict
some economic outcomes (Renault, 2017), disease outbreaks (Carneiro and Mylonakis, 2009)
or happiness (Brodeur et al., 2020).
We relate our Twitter index of social distancing to measures of mobility computed by
Google at the state level for 49 US States1 , controlling for the dates of implementation of the
various state orders (stay-at-home orders, school closures and nonessential business closures).

We remove Alaska and Hawaii from our analysis, and we include Washington DC.

We find strong evidence that differences in the Twitter index of social distancing correlate
with differences in mobility between states, even after controlling for the various dates of
implementations of state orders, rainfall, temperature and the number of new COVID cases.
Our results show that a substantial voluntary response of agents cannot be explained by
government responses to the COVID-19 outbreak.
The results of the paper are of interest for researchers working on spatial differentiation
in the human response to social distancing. A range of papers have studied the relationship
between social capital and social distancing in the United States. Ding et al. (2020) show
that measures of social capital, such as community engagement, moderate the effect of
statewide mobility restrictions on social distancing. For example, community engagement
implies greater costs of social distancing and decreases the impact of stay-at-home orders
on social distancing. Barrios et al. (2020) use civic capital as a moderator of stay-at-home
orders to explain compelled social distancing in the US, at both the individual and country
level, and in Europe. They find that a higher sense of civic duty leads to greater compliance
with social distancing rules, even after the end of a domestic lockdown.
More related to our paper, Allcott et al. (2020) model differences in beliefs and attitudes
as resulting from messages on the crisis from both political leaders and the media. They
use survey data and show that Republicans and Democrats engage in social distancing to
different extents. Their theoretical model is also validated by Bursztyn et al. (2020) and
Simonov et al. (2020), who study the impact of Fox News on stay-at-home behaviors and
show that greater exposure leads to less compliance with social distancing. The present paper
contributes to the literature on the impact of media on compliance with social distancing
rules, as social media not only signals the behavior or sentiment of the population but also
has an impact on readers.
The paper is also related to a growing body of literature on the impact of COVID-19 on

3

household uncertainty. Altig et al. (2020) document a huge increase in uncertainty before and
after the COVID-19 pandemic, using various indicators of economic uncertainty, including
newspaper scraping and measures from expectations surveys. In the same vein, Baker et al.
(2020) construct a Twitter-based economic uncertainty index scraping worldwide tweets
containing the keywords ’economic’ and ’uncertainty’ in the first semester of 2020 to obtain
alternative measures of economic policy uncertainty to measure volatility. Our Twitterbased measure of social distancing captures concerns by the population at the state level,
and the methodology we use can be replicated by researchers seeking to study the effect of
information on behaviors during COVID-19 in different countries.2
Finally, the paper is of interest for researchers working on well-being in the era of COVID19. Brodeur et al. (2020) study the impact of lockdown policies on happiness, as measured
by keyword searches in Google Trends, in Europe and America. They find that people’s
mental health may have been severely affected by the lockdown. The paper that is the
closest to ours is that by Alfaro et al. (2020). They study mobility in 89 cities worldwide as
an outcome of fear measured by Google search data, some measures of social preferences and
government lockdowns. They find that both lockdown policies and fear have a negative effect
on mobility. Our paper contributes to this stream of the literature by using Twitter-based
scraped data, rather than Google Trends data, which give only relative numbers rather than
absolute numbers. The advantage of scraping is that it allows us to obtain the absolute
numbers and to select the most appropriate tweets related to social distancing. Google
Trends does not allow us to create an alternative Google index sorting out search terms that
are correlated with a given term but not having the same meaning (e.g., fear and the TV
show “Fear Factor”).
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 present the data
and the method, respectively. Section 4 introduces the results, and Section 5 concludes the

Data

2.1

Mobility

We use daily Community Mobility Reports data from Google as a proxy for social distancing. The reports chart movement trends over time by geography, across different categories
of places such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations,
workplaces, and residential areas. The mobile location data – anonymized and aggregated
at the state level in the United States – are available since Feb 15, 2020, and show how
visitors to categorized places change compared to the baseline period of Jan 3 to Feb 6, 2020
(before the COVID-19 outbreak). The residential category shows a change in time spent at
home. The five other categories measure the change in total visitors to categorized places.
The data exhibit large differences over time and space, both in levels and in variations.

2.2

Twitter Data

We use geotagged messages from Twitter to capture beliefs at the state level.3 To construct our database, we use a web scraping tool, and we extract all tweets containing the
following keywords: ”stay home”, ”stay safe”, ”save lives”, ”wash hands”, ”wear mask” and
”social distancing”4 . We find that the number of messages protesting against social distancing measures is very low: the percentage of tweets containing keywords or hashtags such as
#ReOpenAmerica, #LockdownProtest (or related keywords) represents less than 1% of all
tweets in our sample. As more than 99% of the tweets containing social distancing keywords
3

We focus on the state level instead of the county level, as the number of tweets we collect was too low
to construct a reliable daily indicator of information at the county level
We also consider variants of those terms and hashtags such as #StayHome

5

are encouraging social distancing, we do not use a sentiment analysis algorithm to derive the
polarity of each message.
We focus our attention on geotagged tweets – messages for which the location of the user
is known – to construct a daily indicator of social distancing beliefs at the state level. We
define T witterSDs,t as the number of tweets about social distancing sent by users located
in state ”s” on day t for 100,000 inhabitants:

T witterSDs,t =

N umberof SocialDistancingT weets,t
∗ 100, 000
P opulations

(1)

We also construct a weighted Twitter-based index by weighting each message encouraging
social distancing by the logarithm of 1 plus its number of likes, its number of retweets or
its number of replies. Tweets with higher numbers of likes, retweets and replies could have
a greater impact on the reduction of mobility, as these messages will be disseminated more
widely and may impact the beliefs of other users. Figure 1 presents an example of a tweet in
our sample where a user both reveals his belief and encourages other users to respect social
distancing.
Twitter is widely used across the United States: there is a total of nearly 50 million
monthly active Twitter users in the US, and 20 million Twitter users are on the platform
daily. Furthermore, users on Twitter mostly follow users from the same metropolitan area.
According to Takhteyev et al. (2012), 39 percent of ties connect users within the same
regional cluster. This suggests that users in a given state are more exposed to the tweets
and beliefs of other users located in the same state. One of the main drawbacks of using
data from Twitter is that geotagged tweets are not representative of the US population: the
Twitter population is biased towards higher incomes and urban areas Malik et al. (2015),
and geotagged tweets are written more often by young people and by women Pavalanathan
and Eisenstein (2015). While we acknowledge that this could limit the generalizability of

Figure 1: Example of a tweet encouraging social distancing.

Notes: This figure presents an example of a tweet encouraging social distancing. This message reveals the beliefs of the user
who sends it and could also influence the behaviors of other users reading the tweet. This tweet was sent on March 16, 2020,
by a user located in Bay Shore, New York. This tweet received three likes. We use the number of likes as a proxy for influence
when we construct our weighted Twitter-based index.

our findings, we add state fixed effects, and we focus on variation across states and over time
to limit the bias due to the specific sample of Twitter users.
Geotagged messages only represent 1 to 2% of all messages sent on Twitter every day.
However, given the very large number of messages sent every day on the platform (approximately 500 million tweets), we still obtain a large database of 402,005 messages containing
at least one social distancing keyword sent between February 15 and May 31, 2020. Tweets
in our sample have an average of 9.21 likes, 1.84 retweets and 0.62 replies. Appendix 2
shows the evolution of the total number of tweets related to social distancing during our
sample period. We observe that the number of tweets increases sharply during the second
week of March – a week, coinciding with the declaration by the World Health Organization
stating that the COVID-19 outbreak was effectively a pandemic and with a structural break
in mobility series identified by Cronin and Evans (2020).

2.3

Controls

We used epidemiological data from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering
(CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. We compute the number of new COVID cases per
100,000 inhabitants for each state and day.5 . We also consider state-level social distancing
policies from Fullman et al. (2020). The dataset includes a wide set of policies, such as
restrictions on gatherings, school closures, stay-at-home orders, and nonessential business
closures. We create a dummy variable by state to indicate whether any of the previous policies were in place on a given date. We consider the date of policy enactment. We also create
a variable to capture political polarization by considering the percentage of Trump votes by
state during the 2016 election. Finally, we use environmental data from the National Centers
for Environmental Information to control for daily rainfall and temperature in each state.
We use the average level of rainfall and the average maximum temperature by considering
observations from all weather stations located in each state.

Methods
We use a simple causal framework in which individuals make their behavioral decisions

based on the marginal benefits and costs of interaction (Andersen, 2020), which depends on
their beliefs and the information they have. The COVID-19 outbreak increases the marginal
costs of social interaction by increasing the probability of infection. This probability of
infection is localized and differs across geographic areas. We estimate the following OLS
model that summarizes our conceptual framework:

M obilitys,t = β1 T witterSDs,t−1 + Xs,t + δs + δd,t + s,t
5

We also consider the number of deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, and we find similar results

8

(2)

where β1 captures the effect of our Twitter social distancing (SD) index.6 Different
communities have different perceptions of risks (Andersen, 2020) and may use social media
to reveal their beliefs and influence the behavior of other agents. Xs,t is a vector of statelevel time-varying controls including average temperature and rainfall, the number of new
COVID cases and state-level social distancing policies. External factors, such as weather
conditions, affect the marginal benefits and costs of social interaction. By the same token,
government policies implemented to increase the costs of social interaction are important
drivers of social distancing. δs controls for all time-invariant state characteristics, such as
population density, preferences or income. For example, different communities have different
preferences in terms of social interactions and risky behaviors. Thus, the marginal cost of
social distancing depends on how much people value outside gatherings, traveling or working
from home, and on their private risk of infection, e.g., whether they suffer from chronic
diseases or the number of COVID-19 cases in the community. δd,t controls for time-varying
division characteristics as well as all time-varying national and international factors. We
consider the nine divisions from the United States Census Bureau.7

Results
Our baseline results are reported in Table 1. The first column reports the OLS model for

residential mobility, and columns (2) to (6) show the results for mobility in various places.
All models include stated fixed effects and division×time fixed effects. We find that the
coefficient of our Twitter index of social distancing is positive in column (1) and negative in
columns (2) to (6). One additional tweet encouraging social distancing per 100,000 inhabi6

The results are similar when we consider T witterSDs,t instead of T witterSDs,t . We choose to use the
lagged value of our Twitter index in an effort to limit the reverse causality between time spent at home
and the number of tweets sent (as users might tweet more when they have more spare time).
We also consider the 4 US regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, West), and we find similar results

tants – which represents an increase of approximately 0.66 standard deviations – is associated
with an increase in time spent at home of approximately 0.3 %. The absolute size of the coefficient is on average lower for residential mobility, as the residential category shows a change
in duration, while the other categories measure a change in total visitors.8 We also find that
the magnitude of the effect is approximately three times larger for mobility to workplaces,
transit stations and national parks than for mobility to retail areas and grocery stores. All
of the other variables are of the expected sign: the number of COVID cases that proxies for
the marginal infection probability decreases all types of mobility (or increases the time spent
at home), rainfall increases time spent home and decreases mobility to parks and grocery
stores, and temperatures decrease time spent home and increase mobility to other places. As
expected, stay-at-home orders have a large and significant effect on mobility. Other social
distancing measures, such as school closures, nonessential business closures, and gathering
restrictions, do not significantly impact mobility when we include stay-at-home orders and
division*time fixed effects. Although these controls attenuate the effect of the Twitter index
of social distancing to some degree, the latter remains significant in all specifications.

Table 2 presents our results when we weight tweets by the number of likes, the number
retweets or the number of replies. Column (1) reports the results of the baseline model.
Columns (2), (3) and (4) report the results of the model using the Twitter index of social
distancing weighted by the number of likes, retweets and replies, respectively. The Twitter indices are standardized to ensure comparability across the different specifications. The
results are only presented for time spent at home to illustrate the impact of the weighted
Twitter indices. The results for the other types of mobility are reported in Appendix 5. We
find that the effects are relatively similar when we use weighted tweets instead of unweighted
8

As people already spend a large portion of their time at home (even outside the COVID period), the
capacity for variation is limited.

tweets. The relative sign of the coefficients of our baseline measure and the weighted measure suggest that the relation between the number of messages related to social distancing
and the observed reduction in mobility is mostly driven by self-disclosed beliefs rather than
by the influence of local tweets on other users’ behavior. This result might also be driven
by the fact that social media tends to favor online “bubbles”: users on Twitter are exposed
primarily to ideologically similar information (Eady et al., 2019), and thus, the influence of
tweets encouraging social distancing sent by individual users might be limited.

An important control for beliefs is partisanship. Table 3 presents our results when we add
an interaction between the share of Republican votes in the 2016 US presidential election and
stay-at-home orders. We find – as in Allcott et al. (2020) – that states with a larger share of
Republican votes in 2016 tend to enforce less social distancing. The interaction is significant
in all the specifications and of the opposite sign as stay-at-home orders. A greater share of
republican votes decreases the impact of stay-at-home orders on mobility. This validates the
intuition that the perception of risk differs significantly based on the partisanship of the community. Intuitively, Republicans might be more attached to individual freedom than to state
action, while Democrats might overreact to state orders.9 The coefficient on the Twitter index of social distancing remains stable and is even slightly higher when partisanship is added.

Table 4 presents the same model as in Table 3 with various geographic and time fixed
effects. The sign and magnitude of the coefficients of social distancing tweets on the time
spent at home are similar to those in Tables 2 and 3, ranging between 0.351 and 1.134.
The models including only geographic fixed effects yield upward-biased coefficients, while
the models including both time and regional fixed effects yield coefficients that are more

We also interact our Twitter-based indicator with the share of Republican votes in the 2016 US presidential election. The interaction is not significant, suggesting that the effect is similar for both Democrats
and Republicans.

behavior in terms of mobility but also on Twitter over time.

Conclusion
The results of the paper show evidence that beliefs shared on Twitter are correlated with

mobility at the state level. Revealed beliefs related to social distancing on Twitter are positively correlated with the practice of social distancing at the state level. The effects remain
significant and stable in magnitude when we control for additional factors. The results of
this paper are helpful to disentangle the effects of voluntary responses based on beliefs from
the effects of government decisions to implement social distancing policies. Social networks
such as Twitter reveal the beliefs of individuals about social distancing and are a good indicator of their willingness to comply with containment policies. The results also show some
differences in the magnitude of alternative Twitter indices considering the number of likes,
tweets and replies. The evidence does not permit us to ultimately pin down the network
effects of self-revealed beliefs on the beliefs and behaviors of other individuals and opens
avenues for further research.

Our analysis has policy implications for flattening the curve. The results suggest that
the impact of voluntary responses, based on beliefs and available information, on mobility is
important and observed across states. Our results demonstrate the importance of accounting
for human beliefs in designing containment policies, which is rarely considered in traditional
SIR models. As beliefs and behaviors are related, excessive lockdown measures might not
be useful when individuals’ behavior is already precautionary and vice versa. Theoretically,
this means that government orders to increase social distancing are not the only instrument

Table 4: Regression with different combinations set of fixed-effects

to combat the negative externality of insufficient social distancing.

There are, of course, limitations to our analysis. The timing and the location of the beliefs
displayed on social networks follows the spread of the infection and the anticipation of the
risk of contamination. By the same token, state orders are not randomly assigned and result
from comparing the economic costs and health outcomes of the measures. If Republicans
are more reluctant to enforce social distancing, Republican governors might also be slower to
adopt a social distancing policy. We cannot rule out that the spread of contamination and
state orders have both direct and indirect effects, via beliefs shared on Twitter, on mobility.
We do not relate our results to some potential outcomes in terms of COVID-19 cases and
deaths or necessary mobility and unnecessary mobility, which we leave to epidemiologists.
