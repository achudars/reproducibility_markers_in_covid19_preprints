Abstract
Face mask use by the general public for limiting the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic
is controversial, though increasingly recommended, and the potential of this intervention
is not well understood. We develop a compartmental model for assessing the communitywide impact of mask use by the general, asymptomatic public, a portion of which may be
asymptomatically infectious. Model simulations, using data relevant to COVID-19 dynamics
in the US states of New York and Washington, suggest that broad adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of COVID-19
and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, mask use decreases the effective
transmission rate in nearly linear proportion to the product of mask effectiveness (as a
fraction of potentially infectious contacts blocked) and coverage rate (as a fraction of the
general population), while the impact on epidemiologic outcomes (death, hospitalizations) is
highly nonlinear, indicating masks could synergize with other non-pharmaceutical measures.
Notably, masks are found to be useful with respect to both preventing illness in healthy persons and preventing asymptomatic transmission. Hypothetical mask adoption scenarios, for
Washington and New York state, suggest that immediate near universal (80%) adoption of
moderately (50%) effective masks could prevent on the order of 17–45% of projected deaths
over two months in New York, while decreasing the peak daily death rate by 34–58%, absent other changes in epidemic dynamics. Even very weak masks (20% effective) can still
be useful if the underlying transmission rate is relatively low or decreasing: In Washington,
where baseline transmission is much less intense, 80% adoption of such masks could reduce
mortality by 24–65% (and peak deaths 15–69%), compared to 2–9% mortality reduction in
New York (peak death reduction 9–18%). Our results suggest use of face masks by the general public is potentially of high value in curtailing community transmission and the burden
of the pandemic. The community-wide benefits are likely to be greatest when face masks
are used in conjunction with other non-pharmaceutical practices (such as social-distancing),
and when adoption is nearly universal (nation-wide) and compliance is high.

Introduction

Under the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus), recommendations and common practices regarding face mask use by the general public have varied greatly

and are in rapid flux: Mask use by the public in public spaces has been controversial in the
US, although as of April 3, 2020, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
is recommending the public wear cloth masks. Public mask use is far more prevalent in many
Asian countries, which have longer experience with novel coronavirus epidemics; public mask
use may have been effective at limiting community spread during the 2003 SARS epidemic
[1, 2], and widespread mask use is a prominent feature of the relatively successful COVID-19
response in Taiwan [50], for example. Masks have also been suggested as method for limiting
community transmission by asymptomatic or at least clinically undetected carriers [51], who
may be a major driver of transmissions of COVID-19 [38]. Various experimental studies suggest
that masks may both protect the wearer from acquiring various infections [10, 9] or transmitting
infection [15]. Medical masks (i.e., surgical masks and N95 respirators) in healthcare workers
appear to consistently protect against respiratory infection under metanalysis [4, 3], although
clinical trials in the community have yielded more mixed results [6, 7, 8]. While medical-grade
masks should be prioritized for healthcare providers, homemade cloth masks may still afford
significant, although variable and generally lesser, protection [12, 9], but clinical trials in the
community remain lacking.
Given the flux in recommendations, and uncertainty surrounding the possible communitywide impact of mass face masks (especially homemade cloth masks) on COVID-19 transmission, we have developed a multi-group Kermack-McKendrick-type compartmental mathematical model, extending prior work geared towards modeling the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g.
[38, 39, 34]), as well as models previously used to examine masks in a potential influenza
pandemic [36, 37]. This initial framework suggests that masks could be effective even if implemented as a singular intervention/mitigation strategy, but especially in combination with other
non-pharmaceutical interventions that decrease community transmission rates.
Whether masks can be useful, even in principle, depends on the mechanisms for transmission
for SARS-CoV-2, which are likely a combination of droplet, contact, and possible airborne
(aerosol) modes. The traditional model for respiratory disease transmission posits infection
via infectious droplets (generally 5–10 µm) that have a short lifetime in the air and infect the
upper respiratory tract, or finer aerosols, which may remain in the air for many hours [42], with
ongoing uncertainties in the relative importance of these modes (and in the conceptual model
itself [41]) for SARS-CoV-2 transmission [45, 41]. The WHO [16] has stated that SARS-CoV-2
transmission is primarily via coarse respiratory droplets and contact routes. An experimental
study [17] using a nebulizer found SARS-CoV-2 to remain viable in aerosols (<5 µm) for three
hours (the study duration), but the clinical relevance of this setup is debatable [16]. One out of
three symptomatic COVID-19 patients caused extensive environmental contamination in [18],
including of air exhaust outlets, though the air itself tested negative.
Face masks can protect against both coarser droplet and finer aerosol transmission, though
N95 respirators are more effective against finer aerosols, and may be superior in preventing
droplet transmission as well [4]. Metanalysis of studies in healthy healthcare providers (in
whom most studies have been performed) indicated a strong protective value against clinical
and respiratory virus infection for both surgical masks and N95 respirators [3]. Case control
data from the 2003 SARS epidemic suggests a strong protective value to mask use by community
members in public spaces, on the order of 70% [1, 2].
Experimental studies in both humans and manikins indicate that a range of mask provide at
least some protective value against various infectious agents [12, 9, 14, 13, 42]. Medical masks
were potentially highly effective as both source control and primary prevention under tidally
breathing and coughing conditions in manikin studies [10, 11], with higher quality masks (e.g.
N95 respirator vs. surgical mask) offering greater protection [11]. It is largely unknown to what
degree homemade masks (typically made from cotton, teacloth, or other polyesther fibers) may
2

protect against droplets/aerosols and viral transmission, but experimental results by Davies et
al. [9] suggest that while the homemade masks were less effective than surgical mask, they were
still markedly superior to no mask. A clinical trial in healthcare workers [5] showed relatively
poor performance for cloth masks relative to medical masks.
Mathematical modeling has been influential in providing deeper understanding on the transmission mechanisms and burden of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to the development of public health policy and understanding. Most mathematical models of the COVID-19
pandemic can broadly be divided into either population-based, SIR (Kermack-McKendrick)type models, driven by (potentially stochastic) differential equations [38, 20, 34, 22, 21, 23, 31,
26, 32, 24, 33], or agent-based models [39, 28, 25, 27, 30], in which individuals typically interact
on a network structure and exchange infection stochastically. One difficulty of the latter approach is that the network structure is time-varying and can be difficult, if not impossible, to
construct with accuracy. Population-based models, alternatively, may risk being too coarse to
capture certain real-world complexities. Many of these models, of course, incorporate features
from both paradigms, and the right combination of dynamical, stochastic, data-driven, and
network-based methods will always depend on the question of interest.
In [38], Li et al. imposed a metapopulation structure onto an SEIR-model to account for
travel between major cities in China. Notably, they include compartments for both documented
and undocumented infections. Their model suggests that as many as 86% of all cases went undetected in Wuhan before travel restrictions took effect on January 23, 2020. They additionally
estimated that, on a per person basis, asymptomatic individuals were only 55% as contagious,
yet were responsible for 79% of new infections, given their increased prevalence. The importance of accounting for asymptomatic individuals has been confirmed by other studies ([39],
[21]). In their model-based assessment of case-fatality ratios, Verity et al. [40] estimated that
40–50% of cases went unidentified in China, as of February 8, 2020, while in the case of the
Princess Diamond cruise ship, 46.5% of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 were
asymptomatic [49]. Further, Calafiore et al. [21], using a modified SIR-model, estimated that,
on average, cases in Italy went underreported by a factor of 63, as of March 30, 2020.
Several prior mathematical models, motivated by the potential for pandemic influenza, have
examined the utility of mask wearing by the general public. These include a relatively simple
modification of an SIR-type model by Brienen et al. [36], while Tracht et al. [37] considered a
more complex SEIR model that explicitly disaggregated those that do and do not use masks.
The latter concluded that, for pandemic H1N1 influenza, modestly effective masks (20%) could
halve total infections, while if masks were just 50% effective as source control, the epidemic
could be essentially eliminated if just 25% of the population wore masks.
We adapt these previously developed SEIR model frameworks for transmission dynamics to
explore the potential community-wide impact of public use of face masks, of varying efficacy
and compliance, on the transmission dynamics and control of the COVID-19 pandemic. In
particular, we develop a two-group model, which stratifies the total population into those who
habitually do and do not wear face masks in public or other settings where transmission may
occur. This model takes the form of a deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations,
and explicitly includes asymptomatically-infectious humans. We examine mask effectiveness
and coverage (i.e., fraction of the population that habitually wears masks) as our two primary
parameters of interest.
We explore possible nonlinearities in mask coverage and effectiveness and the interaction
of these two parameters; we find that the product of mask effectiveness and coverage level
strongly predicts the effect of mask use on epidemiologic outcomes. Thus, homemade cloth
masks are best deployed en masse to benefit the population at large. There is also a potentially
strong nonlinear effect of mask use on epidemiologic outcomes of cumulative death and peak
3

hospitalizations. We note a possible temporal effect: Delaying mass mask adoption too long
may undermine its efficacy. Moreover, we perform simulated case studies using mortality data
for New York and Washington state. These case studies likewise suggest a beneficial role to mass
adoption of even poorly effective masks, with the relative benefit likely greater in Washington
state, where baseline transmission is less intense. The absolute potential for saving lives is still,
however, greater under the more intense transmission dynamics in New York state. Thus, early
adoption of masks is useful regardless of transmission intensities, and should not be delayed
even if the case load/mortality seems relatively low.
In summary, the benefit to routine face mask use by the general public during the COVID-19
pandemic remains uncertain, but our initial mathematical modeling work suggests a possible
strong potential benefit to near universal adoption of even weakly effective homemade masks
that may synergize with, not replace, other control and mitigation measures.

Baseline mathematical models
Model with no mask use

We consider a baseline model without any mask use to form the foundation for parameter
estimation and to estimate transmission rates in New York and Washington state; we also use
this model to determine the equivalent transmission rate reductions resulting from public mask
use in the full model.
We use a deterministic susceptible, exposed, symptomatic infectious, hospitalized, asymptomatic infectious, and recovered modeling framework, with these classes respectively denoted
S(t), E(t), I(t), H(t), A(t), and R(t); we also include D(t) to track cumulative deaths. We
assume that some fraction of detected infectious individuals progress to the hospitalized class,
H(t), where they are unable to pass the disease to the general public; we suppose that some
fraction of hospitalized patients ultimately require critical care (and may die) [35], but do not
explicitly disaggregate, for example, ICU and non-ICU patients. Based on these assumptions
and simplifications, the basic model for the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 is given by the
following deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations:

is the total population in the community, and β(t) is the baseline infectious contact rate, which
is assumed to vary with time in general, but typically taken fixed. Additionally, η accounts for
the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic carriers (in comparison to symptomatic carriers),
σ is the transition rate from the exposed to infectious class (so 1/σ is the disease incubation
period), α is the fraction of cases that are symptomatic, φ is the rate at which symptomatic
individuals are hospitalized, δ is the disease-induced death rate, and γA , γI and γH are recovery
rates for the subscripted population.
We suppose hospitalized persons are not exposed to the general population. Thus, they
are excluded from the tabulation of N , and do not contribute to infection rates in the general
community. This general modeling framework is similar to a variety of SEIR-style models
recently employed in [38, 39], for example.
For most results in this paper, we use let β(t) ≡ β0 . However, given ongoing responses to
the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of voluntary and mandated social distancing, etc., we also
consider the possibility that β varies with time and adopt the following functional form from
Tang et al. [34], with the modification that contact rates do not begin declining from the initial
contact rate, β0 , until time t0 ,

β0 ,
t < t0
(2.9)
β(t) =
βmin + (β0 − βmin ) exp(−r(t − t0 )), t ≥ t0
where βmin is the minimum contact rate and r is the rate at which contact decreases.

2.2

Baseline epidemiological parameters

The incubation period for COVID-19 is estimated to average 5.1 days [19], similar to other
model-based estimates [38], giving σ = 1/5.1 day−1 . Some previous model-based estimates of
infectious duration are on the order of several days [38, 39, 34], with [34] giving about 7 days
for asymptomatic individuals to recover. However, the clinical course of the disease is typically
much longer: In a study of hospitalized patients [35], average total duration of illness until
hospital discharge or death was 21 days, and moreover, the median duration of viral shedding
was 20 days in survivors.
The effective transmission rate (as a constant), β0 , ranges from around 0.5 to 1.5 day−1 in
prior modeling studies [44, 43, 38], and typically trends down with time [34, 38]. We have left
this as a free parameter in our fits to Washington and New York state mortality data, and find
β0 ≈ 0.5 and β0 ≈ 1.4 day−1 for these states, respectively, values this range.
5

The relative infectiousness of asymptomatic carriers, η, is not known, although Ferguson
et al. [39] estimated this parameter at about 0.5, and Li et al. [38] gave values of 0.42–0.55.
The fraction of cases that are symptomatic, α, is also uncertain, with Li et al. [38] suggesting
an overall case reporting rate of just 14% early in the outbreak in China, but increasing to
65–69% later; further, α = 2/3 was used in [39]. In the case of the Diamond Princess Cruise
ship [49], 712 (19.2%) passengers and crews tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, with 331 (46.5%)
asymptomatic at the time of testing. Therefore, we choose α = 0.5 as our default.
Given an average time from symptom onset to dyspnea of 7 days in [35], and 9 days to
sepsis, a range of 1–10 days to hospitalization, a midpoint of 5 days seems reasonable (see also
[39]); φ ≈ 0.025 day−1 is consistent with on the order of 5–15% of symptomatic patients being
hospitalized. If about 15% of hospitalized patients die [39], then δ ≈ 0.015 day−1 (based on
γH = 1/14 day−1 ).
2.2.1

Model with general mask use

We assume that some fraction of the general population wears masks with uniform inward
efficiency (i.e., primary protection against catching disease) of ǫi , and outward efficiency (i.e.,
source control/protection against transmitting disease) of ǫo . We disaggregate all population
variables into those that typically do and do not wear masks, respectively subscripted with U
and M . Based on the above assumptions and simplifications, the extended multi-group model
for COVID-19 (where members of the general public wear masks in public) is given by:

(2.25)

While much more complex than the baseline model, most of the complexity lies in what are
essentially bookkeeping terms. We also consider a reduced version of the above model (equations
not shown), such that only symptomatically infected persons wear a mask, to compare the
consequences of the common recommendation that only those experiencing symptoms (and
their immediate caretakers) wear masks with more general population coverage.

2.3

Mask efficiency parameters

We assume a roughly linear relationship between the overall filtering efficiency of a mask and
clinical efficiency in terms of either inward efficiency (i.e., effect on ǫi ) or outward efficiency (ǫo ),
based on [36]. The fit factor for homemade masks averaged 2 in [9], while the fit factor averaged
5 for surgical masks. When volunteers coughed into a mask, depending upon sampling method,
the number of colony-forming units resulting varied from 17% to 50% for homemade masks and
0–30% for surgical masks, relative to no mask [9].
Surgical masks reduced P. aeruginosa infected aerosols produced by coughing by over 80%
in cystic fibrosis patients in [14], while surgical masks reduced CFU count by >90% in a similar
study [13]. N95 masks were more effective in both studies. Homemade teacloth masks had an
inward efficiency between 58 and 77% over 3 hours of wear in [12], while inward efficiency ranged
72–85% and 98–99% for surgical and N95-equivalent masks. Outward efficiency was marginal
for teacloth masks, and about 50–70% for medical masks. Surgical masks worn by tuberculosis
patients also reduced the infectiousness of hospital ward air in [15], and Leung et al. [42] very
recently observed surgical masks to decrease infectious aerosol produced by individuals with
seasonal coronaviruses. Manikin studies seem to recommend masks as especially valuable under
coughing conditions for both source control [11] and prevention [10].
We therefore estimate that inward mask efficiency could range widely, anywhere from 20–
80% for cloth masks, with ≥50% possibly more typical (and higher values are possible for
well-made, tightly fitting masks made of optimal materials), 70–90% typical for surgical masks,
and >95% typical for properly worn N95 masks. Outward mask efficiency could range from
practically zero to over 80% for homemade masks, with 50% perhaps typical, while surgical
masks and N95 masks are likely 50–90% and 70–100% outwardly protective, respectively.

2.4

Data and model fitting

We use state-level time series for cumulative mortality data compiled by Center for Systems
Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University [47], from January 22, 2020, through
April 2, 2020, to calibrate the model initial conditions and infective contact rate, β0 , as well as
βmin when β(t) is taken as an explicit function of time. Other parameters are fixed at default
values in Table 1. Parameter fitting was performed using nonlinear least squares algorithm implemented using the lsqnonlin function in MATLAB. We consider two US states in particular
as case studies, New York and Washington, and total population data for each state was defined
according to US Census data for July 1, 2019 [48].

3.2.1

Masks coverage/efficacy/time to adoption in simulated epidemics
Mask/efficacy interaction under immediate adoption

We run simulated epidemics using either β0 = 0.5 or 1.5 day −1 , with other parameters set to
the defaults given in Table 1. These parameter sets give epidemic doubling times early in time
(in terms of cumulative cases and deaths) of approximately seven or three days, respectively,
corresponding to case and mortality doubling times observed (early in time) in Washington and
New York state, respectively. We use as initial conditions a normalized population of 1 million
persons, all of whom are initially susceptible, except 50 initially symptomatically infected (i.e.,
5 out 100,000 is the initial infection rate), not wearing masks.
We choose some fraction of the population to be initially in the masked class (“mask coverage”), which we also denote π, and assume ǫo = ǫi = ǫ. The epidemic is allowed to run its
course (18 simulated months) under constant conditions, and the outcomes of interest are peak
hospitalization, cumulative deaths, and total recovered. These results are normalized against
the counterfactual of no mask coverage, and results are presented as heat maps in Figure 1.
Note that the product ǫ × π predicts quite well the effect of mask deployment: Figure 1 also
shows (relative) peak hospitalizations and cumulative deaths as functions of this product. There
is, however, a slight asymmetry between coverage and efficacy, such that increasing coverage of
moderately effective masks is generally more useful than increasing the effectiveness of masks
from a starting point of moderate coverage.

of mask coverage × efficacy, with the left panel giving the absolute value, and the right giving
the ratio of β̃0 to the true β0 in the simulation with masks. That is, simulated epidemics are
run with mask coverage and effectiveness ranging from 0 to 1, and the outcomes are tracked as
synthetic data. The baseline model without mask dynamics is then fit to this synthetic data,
with β0 the trainable parameter; the resulting β0 is the β̃0 . This is done for simulated epidemics
with a true β0 of 1.5, 1, or 0.5 day−1 .
3.2.2

Delayed adoption

We run the simulated epidemics described, supposing the entire population is unmasked until
mass mask adoption after some discrete delay. The level of adoption is also fixed as a constant.
We find that a small delay in mask adoption (without any changes in β) has little effect on
peak hospitalized fraction or cumulative deaths, but the “point of no return” can rapidly be
crossed, if mask adoption is delayed until near the time at which the epidemic otherwise crests.
This general pattern holds regardless of β0 , but the point of no return is further in the future
for smaller β0 .

3.3

Mask use and equivalent β reduction

The relationship between mask coverage, efficacy, and metrics of epidemic severity considered
above are highly nonlinear. The relationship between β0 (the infectious contact rate) and such
metrics is similarly nonlinear. However, incremental reductions in β0 , due to social distances
measures, etc., can ultimately synergize with other reductions to yield a meaningfully effect on
the epidemic. Therefore, we numerically determine what the equivalent change in β0 under the
baseline would have been under mask use at different coverage/efficacy levels, and we denote
the equivalent β0 value as β̃0 .
That is, we numerically simulate an epidemic with and without masks, with a fixed β0 .
Then, we fit the baseline model to this (simulated) case data, yielding a new equivalent β0 ,
β̃0 . An excellent fit giving β̃0 can almost always be obtained, though occasionally results are
extremely sensitive to β0 for high mask coverage/efficacy, yielding somewhat poorer fits. Results

Figure 3: Epidemiologic outcomes and equivalent β0 changes as a function of mask coverage
when masks are either much better at blocking outgoing (ǫo = 0.8, ǫi = 0.2) or incoming
(ǫ0 = 0.2, ǫi = 0.8) transmission. Results are demonstrated for both mask permutations under
simulated epidemics with baseline β0 = 0.5 or 1.5 day −1 .
are summarized in Figure 2, where the β̃0 values obtained and the relative changes in equivalent
β (i.e., (β̃0 ) / (β0 )) are plotted as functions of efficacy times coverage, ǫ × π, under simulated
epidemics with three baseline (true) β0 values.
From Figure 2, we see that even 50% coverage with 50% effective masks roughly halves the
effective disease transmission rate. Widespread adoption, say 80% coverage, of masks that are
only 20% effective still reduces the effective transmission rate by about one-third.

3.4

Outward vs. inward efficiency

Figure 3 demonstrates the effect of mask coverage on peak hospitalizations, cumulative deaths,
and equivalent β0 values when either ǫo = 0.2 and ǫi = 0.8, or visa versa (and for simulated
epidemics using either β0 = 0.5 or 1.5 day −1 . These results suggest that, all else equal, the
protection masks afford against acquiring infection (ǫo ) is actually slightly more important
than protection against transmitting infection (ǫi ), although there is overall little meaningful
asymmetry.

3.5

Masks for symptomatic alone vs. general population

Finally, we consider numerical experiments where masks are given to all symptomatically infected persons, whether they otherwise habitually wear masks or not (i.e., both IU and IM
actually wear masks). We explore how universal mask use in symptomatically infected persons
interacts with mask coverage among the general population; we let ǫIo represent the effectiveness
of masks in the symptomatic, not necessarily equal to ǫo . We again run simulated epidemics
with no masks, universal masks among the symptomatic, and then compare different levels of
mask coverage in the general (asymptomatic) population. In this section, we use equivalent
β0 as our primary metric. Figure 4 shows how this metric varies as a function of the mask

worn by the general public.
We also explore how conclusions vary when either 25%, 50%, or 75% of infectious COVID19 patients are asymptomatic (i.e., we vary α). Unsurprisingly, the greater the proportion of
infected people are asymptomatic, the more benefit there is to giving the general public masks
in addition to those experiencing symptoms.

Simulated case studies: New York & Washington states

Fitting to cumulative death data, we use the baseline model to determine the best fixed β0
and I(0) for cumulative death data for New York and Washington state. We use New York
state data beginning on March 1, 2020, through April 2, 2020, and Washington state data from
February 20, 2020 through April 2, 2020. For New York state, best-fit parameters are I(0) =
208 (range 154–264) and β0 = 1.40 (1.35–1.46) day−1 under fixed β0 . For the time-varying β(t),
we fix r = 0.03 day−1 and t0 = 20, yielding a best-fit β0 = 1.33 (1.24–1.42) day−1 , βmin = 0.51
(-0.25–1.26) day−1 , and I(0) = 293 (191–394).
For Washington state, parameters are I(0) = 622 (571–673) and β0 = 0.50 (0.49–0.52) day−1
under fixed β0 . For time-varying β(t), we fix r = 0.04 day−1 and t0 = 0, to yield a best-fit β0
= 1.0 (0.87–1.23) day−1 , βmin = 0.10 (0–0.19) day−1 , and I(0) = 238 (177–300).
We fix r and t0 , as it is not possible to uniquely identify r, t0 and βmin , from death or
case data alone (see e.g., [46] on identifiability problems). Figure 5 gives cumulative death and
case data versus the model predictions for the two states, and for the two choices of β(t). Note
that while modeled and actual cumulative deaths match well, model-predicted cases markedly
exceed reported cases in the data, consistent with the notion of broad underreporting.
We then consider either fixed β0 or time-varying β(t), according to the parameters above,
in combination with the following purely hypothetical scenarios in each state.

1. No masks, epidemic runs its course unaltered with either β(t) ≡ β0 fixed or β(t) variable
as described above.
2. The two β scenarios are considered in combination with: (1) weak, moderate, or strong
deployment of masks, such that π = 0.2, 0.5, or 0.8; and (2) weak, moderate, or strong
masks, such that ǫ = 0.2, 0.5, or 0.8. No masks are used up until April 2, 2020, and then
these coverage levels are instantaneously imposed.
This yields 18 scenarios in all (nine mask coverage/efficacy scenarios, plus two underlying
trends). Following the modeled imposition of masks on April 2, 2020, the scenarios are run
for 60 additional simulated days. Figures 6 and 8 summarize the future modeled death toll in
each city under the 18 different scenarios, along with historical mortality data. Figures 7 and
9 show modeled daily death rates, with deaths peaking sometime in late April in New York
state under all scenarios, while deaths could peak anywhere from mid-April to later than May,
for Washington state. We emphasize that these are hypothetical and exploratory results, with
possible death tolls varying dramatically based upon the future course of β(t). However, the
results do suggest that even modestly effective masks, if widely used, could help “bend the
curve,” with the relative benefit greater in combination with a lower baseline β0 or stronger
underlying trend towards smaller β(t) (i.e., in Washington vs. New York).

Discussion & Conclusions

This study aims to contribute to this debate by providing realistic insight into the communitywide impact of widespread use of face masks by members of the general population. We designed
a mathematical model, parameterized using data relevant to COVID-19 transmission dynamics
in two US states (New York and Washington). The model suggests a nontrivial benefit to face
mask use by the general public that may vary nonlinearly with mask effectiveness, coverage,
14

and baseline disease transmission intensity. Face masks should be advised not just for those
experiencing symptoms, and likely protect both truly healthy wearers and avoid transmission
by asymptomatic carriers. The community-wide benefits are greatest when mask coverage is as
near universal as possible.
There is considerable ongoing debate on whether to recommend general public face mask
use (likely mostly homemade cloth masks or other improvised face coverings) [51], and while the
situation is in flux, more authorities are recommending public mask use, though they continue
to (rightly) cite appreciable uncertainty. With this study, we hope to help inform this debate
by providing insight into the potential community-wide impact of widespread face mask use
by members of the general population. We have designed a mathematical model, parameterized using data relevant to COVID-19 transmission dynamics in two US states (New York and
Washington), and our model suggests nontrivial and possibly quite strong benefit to general
face mask use. The population-level benefit is greater the earlier masks are adopted, and at
least some benefit is realized across a range of epidemic intensities. Moreover, even if they have,
as a sole intervention, little influence on epidemic outcomes, face masks decrease the equivalent effective transmission rate (β0 in our model), and thus can stack with other interventions,
including social distancing and hygienic measures especially, to ultimately drive nonlinear decreases in epidemic mortality and healthcare system burden. It bears repeating that our model
results are consistent with the idea that face masks, while no panacea, may synergize with other
non-pharmaceutical control measures and should be used in combination with and not in lieu
of these.
Under simulated epidemics, the effectiveness of face masks in altering the epidemiologic
outcomes of peak hospitalization and total deaths is a highly nonlinear function of both mask
efficacy and coverage in the population (see Figure 1), with the product of mask efficacy and
coverage a good one-dimensional surrogate for the effect. We have determined how mask use
in the full model alters the equivalent β0 , denoted β̃0 , under baseline model (without masks),
finding this equivalent β̃0 to vary nearly linearly with efficacy × coverage (Figure 2).
Masks alone, unless they are highly effective and nearly universal, may have only a small
effect (but still nontrivial, in terms of absolute lives saved) in more severe epidemics, such as
the ongoing epidemic in New York state. However, the relative benefit to general masks use
may increase with other decreases in β0 , such that masks can synergize with other public health
measures. Thus, it is important that masks not be viewed as an alternative, but as a complement, to other public health control measures (including non-pharmaceutical interventions,
such as social distancing, self-isolation etc.). Delaying mask adoption is also detrimental. These
factors together indicate that even in areas or states where the COVID-19 burden is low (e.g.
the Dakotas), early aggressive action that includes face masks may pay dividends.
These general conclusions are illustrated by our simulated case studies, in which we have
tuned the infectious contact rate, β (either as fixed β0 or time-varying β(t)), to cumulative
mortality data for Washington and New York state through April 2, 2020, and imposed hypothetical mask adoption scenarios. The estimated range for β is much smaller in Washington
state, consistent with this state’s much slower epidemic growth rate and doubling time. Model
fitting also suggests that total symptomatic cases may be dramatically undercounted in both
areas, consistent with prior conclusions on the pandemic [38]. Simulated futures for both states
suggest that broad adoption of even weak masks use could help avoid many deaths, but the
greatest relative death reductions are generally seen when the underlying transmission rate also
falls or is low at baseline.
Considering a fixed transmission rate, β0 , 80% adoption of 20%, 50%, and 80% effective
masks reduces cumulative relative (absolute) mortality by 1.8% (4,419), 17% (41,317), and 55%
(134,920), respectively, in New York state. In Washington state, relative (absolute) mortality
15

reductions are dramatic, amounting to 65% (22,262), 91% (31,157), and 95% (32,529). When
β(t) varies with time, New York deaths reductions are 9% (21,315), 45% (103,860), and 74%
(172,460), while figures for Washington are 24% (410), 41% (684), and 48% (799). In the latter
case, the epidemic peaks soon even without masks. Thus, a range of outcomes are possible,
but both the absolute and relative benefit to weak masks can be quite large; when the relative
benefit is small, the absolute benefit in terms of lives is still highly nontrivial.
Most of our model projected mortality numbers for New York and Washington state are quite
high (except for variable β(t) in Washington), and likely represent worst-case scenarios as they
primarily reflect β values early in time. Thus, they may be dramatic overestimates, depending
upon these states’ populations ongoing responses to the COVID-19 epidemics. Nevertheless,
the estimated transmission values for the two states, under fixed and variable β(t) represent a
broad range of possible transmission dynamics, are within the range estimated in prior studies
[43, 44, 38], and so we may have some confidence in our general conclusions on the possible
range of benefits to masks. Note also that we have restricted our parameter estimation only
to initial conditions and transmission parameters, owing to identifiability problems with more
complex models and larger parameter groups (see e.g. [46]). For example, the same death data
may be consistent with either a large β0 and low δ (death rate), or visa versa.
Considering the subproblem of general public mask use in addition to mask use for source
control by any (known) symptomatic person, we find that general face mask use is still highly
beneficial (see Figure 4). Unsurprisingly, this benefit is greater if a larger proportion of infected
people are asymptomatic (i.e., α in the model is smaller). Moreover, it is not the case that
masks are helpful exclusively when worn by asymptomatic infectious persons for source control,
but provide benefit when worn by (genuinely) healthy people for prevention as well. Indeed, if
there is any asymmetry in outward vs. inward mask effectiveness, inward effectiveness is actually
slightly preferred, although the direction of this asymmetry matters little with respect to overall
epidemiologic outcomes. At least one experimental study [11] does suggest that masks may be
superior at source control, especially under coughing conditions vs. normal tidal breathing and
so any realized benefit of masks in the population may still be more attributable to source
control.
This is somewhat surprising, given that ǫo appears more times than ǫi in the model terms
giving the forces of infection, which would suggest outward effectiveness to be of greater import
at first glance. Our conclusion runs counter to the notion that general public masks are primarily
useful in preventing asymptomatically wearers from transmitting disease: Masks are valuable
as both source control and primary prevention. This may be important to emphasize, as some
people who have self-isolated for prolonged periods may reasonably believe that the chance they
are asymptomatically infected is very low and therefore do not need a mask if they venture into
public, whereas our results indicate they (and the public at large) still stand to benefit.
Our theoretical results still must be interpreted with caution, owing to a combination of
potential high rates of noncompliance with mask use in the community, uncertainty with respect
to the intrinsic effectiveness of (especially homemade) masks at blocking respiratory droplets
and/or aerosols, and even surprising amounts of uncertainty regarding the basic mechanisms for
respiratory infection transmission [4, 41]. Several lines of evidence support the notion that masks
can interfere with respiratory virus transmission, including clinical trials in healthcare workers
[3, 4], experimental studies as reviewed [12, 10, 9, 15, 11], and case control data from the 2003
SARS epidemic [1, 2]. Given the demonstrated efficacy of medical masks in healthcare workers
[3], and their likely superiority over cloth masks in [5], it is clearly essential that healthcare
works be prioritized when it comes to the most effective medical mask supply. Fortunately, our
theoretical results suggest significant (but potentially highly variable) value even to low quality
masks when used widely in the community.
16

With social distancing orders in place, essential service providers (such as retail workers,
emergency services, law enforcement, etc.) represent a special category of concern, as they
represent a largely unavoidable high contact node in transmission networks: Individual publicfacing workers may come into contact with hundreds or thousands of people in the course of
a day, in relatively close contact (e.g. cashiers). Such contact likely exposes the workers to
many asymptomatic carriers, and they may in turn, if asymptomatic, expose many susceptible
members of the general public to potential transmission. Air exposed to multiple infectious
persons (e.g. in grocery stores) could also carry a psuedo-steady load of infectious particles,
for which masks would be the only plausible prophylactic[10]. Thus, targeted, highly effective
mask use by service workers may be reasonable. We are currently extending the basic model
framework presented here to examine this hypothesis.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that face mask use should be as nearly universal (i.e.,
nation-wide) as possible and implemented without delay, even if most mask are homemade and
of relatively low quality. This measure could contribute greatly to controlling the COVID-19
pandemic, with the benefit greatest in conjunction with other non-pharmaceutical interventions
that reduce community transmission. Despite uncertainty, the potential for benefit, the lack
of obvious harm, and the precautionary principle lead us to strongly recommend as close to
universal (homemade, unless medical masks can be used without diverting healthcare supply)
mask use by the general public as possible.
