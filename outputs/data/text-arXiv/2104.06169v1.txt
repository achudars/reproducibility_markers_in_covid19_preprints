Abstract
Various measures have been taken in different countries to mitigate the Covid-19 epidemic. But, throughout the world, many
citizens don’t understand well how these measures are taken and even question the decisions taken by their government. Should
the measures be more (or less) restrictive? Are they taken for a too long (or too short) period of time? To provide some quantitative
elements of response to these questions, we consider the well-known SEIR model for the Covid-19 epidemic propagation and
propose a pragmatic model of the government decision-making operation. Although simple and obviously improvable, the proposed
model allows us to study the tradeoff between health and economic aspects in a pragmatic and insightful way. Assuming a given
number of phases for the epidemic (namely, 4 in this paper) and a desired tradeoff between health and economic aspects, it is then
possible to determine the optimal duration of each phase and the optimal severity level (i.e., the target transmission rate) for each
of them. The numerical analysis is performed for the case of France but the adopted approach can be applied to any country. One
of the takeaway messages of this analysis is that being able to implement the optimal 4´phase epidemic management strategy
in France would have led to 1.05 million of infected people and a GDP loss of 231 billions e instead of 6.88 millions of
infected and a loss of 241 billions e. This indicates that, seen from the proposed model perspective, the effectively implemented
epidemic management strategy is good economically, whereas substantial improvements might have been obtained in terms of
health impact. Our analysis indicates that the lockdown/severe phase should have been more severe but shorter, and the adjustment
phase occurred earlier. Due to the natural tendency of people to deviate from the official rules, updating measures every month
over the whole epidemic episode seems to be more appropriate.

I. I NTRODUCTION
One of the goals of this work is to provide a simple but exploitable model to measure the quality of the epidemic management
strategy implemented by a government to mitigate the health and macro-economic impacts of the Covid-19 epidemic. The
quality is measured in terms of the tradeoff between the total number of infected people over a given period of time and
the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) loss, under a constraint of the total number of infected people requiring Intensive Care
Units (ICU). To reach this objective, we propose a behavioral model for governmental decision-making operations. Although
we assume a simple measure for the quality of the lockdown measures and a simple dynamical model (namely, a classical
susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model), the proposed approach is seen to be sufficient to constitute a first step into
capturing and quantifying the tradeoff under consideration. In contrast with most studies conducted on the Covid-19 epidemic
analysis where the primary goal is to refine the SEIR model (see e.g., [1]–[5]) or employ the SEIR model by accounting for
local variations (by using a given SEIR model per geographical region - see e.g., [6]) or for the impact of class type (by
age, sex, risk level - see e.g., [7]) our approach is to use the standard SEIR model for an entire country and choose a simple
economic model to focus on the study of the tradeoff between health and economic aspects.
Although there have been many several interesting studies on the economic impact of Covid-19 (see e.g., [8]–[12]),the
pursued goal of these studies is not to model the behavior of the government. As a consequence, the proposed tradeoff has
not been analyzed, at least formally. In fact, the closest contribution to this direction would be given by [13] where generic
discrete-time epidemics over multiple regions are considered, the particular 4-phase structure is not considered, the focus is
not on Covid-19, and the key aspect of the tradeoff analysis is neither developed nor analyzed. Additionally, the numerous
studies available on the problem of the transmission rate control generally concern the continuous-time control approach. In
this work, the focus is on a multiple phase approach (namely, 4 phases). In the literature dedicated to epidemic control, one
can for instance find that some recent studies on how the lockdown strategies and quarantine can be planned in an optimal
fashion [14]–[17]. A common feature to all these works on optimal control and lockdown planning is that the policies under
consideration, vary over time in a continuous manner, i.e., the lockdown policy is continuously evolving based on the infected
population or just on time. However, from the perspective of a government, implementing such policies is not practical since
daily changes of the epidemic control measures are difficult to be implemented and to be followed by people.
Summarizing, compared to the existing literature on epidemics modelling and control of epidemics, the main contribution
of our work is fourfold:
‚ a model for capturing the tradeoff between health and economic aspect and therefore for the government decision-making
operation is proposed and studied;

and the natural reproduction number R0 being fixed).

the focus is on multiple phase control policies and not on general continuous-time control policies (to be precise, 4 phases
are assumed, see Figure 1);
the problem of finding the optimal features of the optimal epidemic management policy (i.e., the target severity level
for each phase and the switching time instants) is stated and solved exhaustively. Additionally, to refine the analysis, we
assume a simple model for the natural time drift in terms of behavior of people;
the numerical analysis of the tradeoff is dedicated to the Covid-19 epidemic and a case study for France.
II. M ETHODS

A. Epidemic model
To model the dynamics of the Covid-19 epidemic globally i.e., over an entire country, we assume a standard SEIR model.
Let us respectively denote by s, e, i, and r the fractions of the population: being susceptible to be infected by the SARS-Cov2
virus, having been exposed to it, being infected, and being removed (including recoveries and deceases). The epidemic is
assumed to obey the following continuous-time dynamics:

δ
We assume that the the control action uptq taken by the decision-maker (the government or possibly a more local decisionmaker) has a linear effect on the transmission virus rate. Additionally, the effectiveness of this action is assumed to undergo
a non-controllable drift or attenuation effect due to the observed fact that people tend to relax their effort over time [18] [19],
hence the presence of the attenuation factor aptq yields:
‚

βptq “ R0 δ ´ uptqaptq

(2)

where R0 is the natural reproduction number (namely, without any control or population awareness), uptq P r0, U s is the control
action or severity level of the lockdown measures. Note that U corresponds to the most drastic or severe control action (in
theory it could reach the value R0 δ and make the reproduction number vanishing). In this work, uptq is a piecewise-constant
function. For the numerical analysis, we will assume aptq to be a linearly decreasing function of time (as detailed in the next
section). Therefore, one can define the time-varying effective reproduction number:

(3)

As illustrated by Figure 1, we are solving an epidemic control problem in which determining the function uptq or Rptq
amounts to jointly determining the switching instants τ0 , τ1 ,τ2 and the targeted reproduction numbers R1 , R2 , R3 ; T is a
given period of time for the epidemic analysis. In particular, we will determine the best duration of the lockdown phase τ1
and the corresponding targeted reproduction number R1 . Figure 1 shows for instance that if the lockdown measures taken are
such the reproduction number is R1 at the beginning of the lockdown phase, then, because of the drift induced by the typical
human behavior, the effective reproduction number increases over time.
B. Time drift or people behavior model
We propose here a model for the attenuation function aptq, which quantifies the degree to which people relax their effort to
implement the government management measures. As the attenuation effect is negligible when a new policy is released, we
consider that aptq “ 1 when t P tτ0 , τ1 , τ2 u. The attenuation factor is assumed to increase over time in each phase, and we
assume the following piecewise linear behavior between phases:

where a1 , a2 , and a3 respectively represent the attenuation coefficients during the lockdown phase, after the lockdown phase,
and during the adjustment phase.
C. Decision-maker behavior model
The proposed model for the behavior of the decision-maker is based on the fact that it wants to obtain a given tradeoff
between economic and health aspects. For the cost related to the economics loss, we assume the simplest reasonable model.
That is, we assume that economic cost is quadratic in the control action. For the health cost, we assume that it is given
by the number of infected people over the given period of time. Therefore, the proposed overall cost consists of a convex
combination of these two costs. By minimizing the overall cost, one realizes the desired tradeoff between economic and health
ICU
aspects. On top of this we impose the number of patients requiring intensive care to be under a given threshold Nmax
. Thus,
the corresponding minimization is performed under a constraint on the number of people infected at any time t P r0, T s:
ICU

σN iptq ď Nmax
, N being the population size, Nmax

patients has reached 7 148 (on April 8, 2020) but the capacity over the whole territory has been evaluated to be greater than
15 000. By denoting α P r0, 1s the weight assigned to the macroeconomic impact of the epidemic and Ke ą 0, Kh ą 0,

where:
‚

‚

Ke ą 0 and Kh ą 0 are constants that weight the economic and health cost functions (they also act as conversion factors
allowing one to obtain appropriate units and orders of magnitude);
τ0 and τ1 represent the lockdown starting time and duration, respectively. Tmin is the minimum lockdown duration to
make the lockdown policies effective. The quantity τ2 represents the duration of the post-lockdown phase;
the parameters µ1 , µ2 ě 1 accounts for possible differences in terms of economic impact between the lockdown and
post-lockdown phases;
sp0q and spT q are respectively the fractions of the population susceptible at the beginning and the end of the analysis.

We would like to make additional comments concerning the parameter µ1 , µ2 . The motivation for introducing µ1 , µ2 is twofold.
First, after lockdown, people are more aware and act more responsibly than before lockdown. This means that automatic and
costless population distancing typically occurs [8], [20], [21]. Taking µ1 , µ2 ě 1 precisely amounts to having a smaller
reproduction number without any cost for the government. Additionally, as people typically tend to relax their effort to
implement the epidemic management measures as time passes, it makes sense to assume that µ1 ě µ2 in our model. It also
allows one to account for the fact that, after lockdown, the economic activity grows after the lockdown and the effects of
the pandemic starts vanishing. This means that, in some sense we ignore memory effects due to lockdown measures. Further
refinements of the proposed model might be considered to account for the lockdown memory effects. This is out of the scope
of the present paper but we believe that, this would correspond to assuming µi ă 1.
D. 4-Phase optimal control with piecewise constant control actions
Solving analytically the optimization problem given by (5) is not trivial. However, since we restrict our attention to a certain
class of control policies, the problem turns out to be solvable through exhaustive search. Assuming the attenuation factor
apτ0 q “ apτ1 q “ apτ2 q “ 1 (no attenuation at the beginning of each phase) and a constant control action in each phase, by
using the relation uptq “ δrR0 ´ Rptqs, the OP (5) can be rewritten under a more convenient form for numerical purposes:

where Ri represents the desired or target reproduction number over Phase i P t1, 2, 3u without considering the attenuation
factor (also, it is the reproduction number at the start of i-th phase). The second constraint is introduced here as there is a gap
between lockdown reproduction number and after lockdown reproduction number. Finally, the conversion factors Ke and Kh
are chosen as follows. The rationale behind the choice of Ke is that when choosing α “ 1 the GDP loss should correspond to
the best estimations made by economists. The GDP loss over the lockdown period for a given country is denoted by ∆GDP,
the conversion factor Ke is chosen as follows:
Ke δ 2 pR0 ´ R1 q2 τ1 “ ∆GDP.

(7)

For France for example, the GDP loss during the lockdown has been evaluated (on April 20) to be around 120 billions
e according to the OFCE [22]. At last, the constant Kh is merely chosen as Kh “ N , that is, when α “ 0 the cost function
corresponds to the number of people infected over the considered period of time.

III. R ESULTS
A. General simulation setup
To perform exhaustive search over the sextuple of variables pτ0 , τ1 , τ2 , R1 , R2 , R3 q, time and amplitudes are quantized;
we thus use hat notations to indicate corresponding values are quantized. Time is discretized with a step of 24 hours (that
is, one sample for each day) and a time horizon of Tp “ 300 days (which approximately corresponds to 10 months that
is the interval [March 1st, December 31th], for the tradeoff figure presented in Sec 3.4, for computational convenience, we
take Tp “ 210 days corresponding to 7 months from March 1st to September 30th) is assumed. The sets for the possible
lockdown starting days, the lockdown duration (in days), post-lockdown phase duration, and the reproduction numbers are as
p1 P t0.4, 0.2, ..., 1.5u, R
p2 P t0.4, 0.2, ..., 1.5u,
follows: τp0 P t1, 2, ..., 30u, τp1 P tTmin, Tmin ` 1, ..., 90u, τp2 P t1, 2, ..., 120u, R
p3 P t0.4, 0.2, ..., 1.5u. Excluding Figure 5, due to the physical characteristics of the epidemics in France, we set Tmin “ 30

because the lockdown duration is at least 4 weeks or 1 month to make the lockdown effective in real systems [24] [25] [26].

many works and in particular the studies performed for France [23] and Italy [16]. The population size is set to N “ 66.106,
ICU
the maximum number of patients requiring intensive care is set to Nmax
“ 15.103, and σ “ 1.5% [24] [25] [26]. Notice
that this number is only reached for very small values of α (for which the total number of people infected over the analysis
duration would be around 9 millions). The exposed population on March 1 2020 is initialized to N ep0q “ 1.33.105. This
number is obtained from analyzing the data provided in [24]. We consider the number of reported deaths at a given time to be
a more reliable way of tracking the evolution of the pandemic rather than the reported number of infected people. Indeed, as
soon as one examines absolute values, they typically become irrelevant. For example, during lockdown, because of the lack of
tests and measurements, the real number of infected people was much higher than the official number. Now, even when tests
were performed intensively, because of false positives, the absolute number of infected were again completely unreliable. For
a prevalence of 1{1000 and a test reliability of 5% of false positives we see that the number of infected for 1000 people is
declared to be about 50 whereas the actual number of infected is only 1. Motivated by these critical issues, we have considered
figures which are much more reliable such as the number of deceases due to Covid-19 in France [23] [24]. From the number
of deaths and the global average rate (worldwide) of the mortality rate (in the range 0.3% ´ 0.5% when averaged over classes
of ages and countries), the reconstructed number of infected people turns out to be more accurate. Therefore, by fixing the
mortality rate to a given value (in [23] for instance, the mortality rate averaged over all the classes of infected people is
evaluated to be around 0.53% for France), one can estimate the exposed and infected population size 3 to 4 weeks before the
measured number of deaths due to Covid-19. For our computation, the initial conditions of the ordinary differential equations
(ODE) equations are chosen as sp0q “ 1 ´ ep0q, ip0q “ rp0q “ 0, and the ODE is solved by using the Matlab ode45 solver.
Concerning the economic cost for France related to Covid-19, the GDP loss over the lockdown period is estimated by the
OFCE [22] to be 120 billions e and we have, as reliable figures, that τ1France “ 55 days with R0France “ 3.5 and R1France “ 0.6.
We therefore take Ke “ 7.379.109 e/day. Values of the reproduction number for the first two phases come from past and
quite accurate evaluations (see e.g., [25]). The value R2France “ 0.9 is less accurate and corresponds to the assumption that the
government has been aiming at giving as much as freedom to the population while avoiding a second wave. Based on available
statistics on Covid-19 in France [26], the attenuation coefficients of the drift model have been chosen as follows: a1 “ 0.1%,
a2 “ 0.2%, a3 “ 0.2%. Unless stated otherwise, the economic impact parameters are chosen as µ1 “ 1.41 (i.e., µ21 „ 2) and
µ2 “ 1.3. Also, when α is assumed to be fixed, it is set to 10´4 .
To justify the choice of the attenuation parameters, that is, a1 “ 0.1%, a2 “ 0.2%, a3 “ 0.2%, we apply the French policy
into our model. By comparing the active cases obtained from our model and the official data, it can be illustrated in Fig. 2
that our model matches well with the real data, especially in the second-half of the plot, where the number of tests conducted
are sufficiently large. This validate the choice of our model and parameters. The mismatch on March and April are mainly due
to the lacking number of tests that were taken during the early outbreak of the pandemic, leading to a much lower reported
number of active cases.
B. Optimal tradeoff between economic and health impacts
With the proposed government decision-making model, implementing a desired tradeoff between the health cost and economic
cost merely amounts to choosing a given value for the parameter α. Figure 3 depicts for various values of α in the interval
r10´7 , 10´4 s the total GDP loss and number of infected people that is obtained after choosing the (quantized version of the)
sextuple pτ0 , τ1 , τ2 , R1 , R2 , R3 q that minimizes the combined cost given by Equation (6). At one extreme, when α is relatively
large (α “ 10´4 ) (that is, when the government aims at minimizing the economic cost in the first place - always under the
ICU capacity constraint) we see that the best epidemic management strategy leads to a GDP loss over the entire study period
[March 1, September 30] is about 206 billions e with 7.16 millions infected, and 15 000 patients requiring intensive care. At
the other extreme, when α is relatively small (α “ 10´7 ), the GDP loss reaches values as high as 295 billion e with a total
number of newly infected people over the period [March 1, September 30] as low as 23 162. To evaluate the efficiency of the
epidemic management strategy of the French government policy, we have represented the point corresponding to the estimated

number of infected people and GDP loss by September 30; with our model, the GDP loss over the period of time of interest
is 241 billion e and the total number of infected people is about 6.88 million. What the best tradeoff curve indicates is that
there were management policies that would allow the French government to have a better ”performance” both in terms of
GDP loss and the number of infected people. For instance, we indicate a point for which it would have been possible to have
about 1.05 million people infected (that is, about 6 times less than what is estimated with the current policy) while ensuring
a total GDP loss of 231 billions e. Which type of epidemic management strategy should be used to have such an outcome?
The next sections provide a detailed analysis of the features of the optimal strategy.

of infected people by about 6 while saving about 10 billions e in terms of GDP with the optimal 4-phase strategy.

Fig. 4: When economic losses are assumed to be uniform over time (µ “ 1), there is some economic incentive to delay the
lockdown, but this delay is seen to be at maximum 4 days. When economic losses are lower after lockdown than during it, it
is beneficial to start the lockdown faster, up to 3 days delay.

C. Optimal features of the optimal epidemic management strategy
One of the important features for controlling the Covid-19 epidemic which has been well commented in newspapers in
various countries is the lockdown starting time. To minimize the health cost, the answer is ready: the lockdown phase should
always start as soon as possible. But when one wants to realize a tradeoff between health and economic costs, the answer
is less immediate. For different values for µ1 and µ2 , Figure 4 provides the best day to start locking down the population,
for one hundred values of α ranging from 10´4 to 10´6 . The main message of this figure is that, even for (relatively) large
values for α (that is, when the economic cost dominates the health cost), the optimal lockdown starting day should be before
March 4th (i.e., τ0 ď 4). This clearly shows that, once an epidemic has been declared, invoking economic damages to delay
the lockdown phase is not acceptable. Note that this conclusion holds when economic losses are assumed to be uniform over
time (µ1 “ µ2 “ 1). When the economic cost associated with a given intensity or severity level is lower after lockdown than
during it (here µ1 “ 1.41 and µ2 “ 1.3), it is always optimal to start locking down as soon as possible. Note that our model
does not capture the possible fact that population needs to be psychologically prepared to follow the lockdown measures. In
France, by March 17, there were official figures about the epidemic which were sufficiently critical to make the population
accept the measures whereas, starting on March 4 (the optimal starting date for µ1 “ µ2 “ 1) the situation might have not
been critical enough to create full adhesion to government measures.
A second key feature of the Covid-19 epidemic control strategy was the lockdown phase duration namely, the value of τ1 .
To better explore the relationship between τ1 and α (the tradeoff), we relax the lockdown duration constraint here and set
Tmin “ 1. For pµ1 , µ2 q “ p1, 1q and pµ1 , µ2 q “ p1.41, 1.3q, Figure 5 provides the optimal lockdown duration (in days) for
values of α ranging from 10´4 to 10´6 . For pµ1 , µ2 q “ p1, 1q (i.e., when economic losses are uniform over time), the optimal
duration ranges from 53 days to 83 days for a large fraction of the considered interval for α. Interestingly, we see that these
values are relatively close to the lockdown duration effectively imposed in France namely 55 days. For larger values of µ1 and
µ2 , the optimal lockdown duration is seen to be much smaller. Therefore, if economic losses are uniform over time, the French
government policy seems to be very coherent. On the other hand, if the economic impact is smaller after lockdown, our study
suggests shorter lockdown durations. In fact, our results show the existence of a critical value for the tradeoff parameter α
above which the second phase of the management of the epidemic should not be present. This means that the optimal control
consists of three phases instead of four.
To conclude this section, let us consider Figure 6. For the by default scenario studied in this paper (pµ1 , µ2 q “ p1.41, 1.3q,
α “ 10´4 ), the figure represents the evolution of number of infected people, that is, N iptq, and the transmission rate when
the optimal policy is adopted. First, it is seen that for the health-economic tradeoff corresponding to α “ 10´4 , there is no
interest in delaying the lockdown phase. By ”lockdown” phase, the authors mean that it might be any type of phase for which
the reproduction number is as low as 0.4 (versus the estimated 0.6 in France); very efficient digital tracing and intensive use of
face masks is also an option which has been successfully adopted in countries such as South Korea (see e.g., [27]). The optimal
lockdown phase duration is seen to be about 1 month (instead of 2 for France). We see that the existence of an adjustment

Fig. 5: When economic losses are assumed to be uniform over time (µ “ 1), it is optimal to have a long lockdown (typically
between 60 ´ 80 days) whatever the tradeoff desired. But, if the economic losses of the third phase are less than during
lockdown, the lockdown phase should be shorter.

phase is part of the optimal policy. For this point, we see that the adjustment phase should have occurred much before in
France (end of June versus end of September). The next section is precisely dedicated to the impact of the adjustment phase.

D. Lockdown policies with different R0
Since the natural reproduction number R0 depends on temperatures, population density, may vary over time due to mutation
effects, and in any case is not known perfectly, it is of interest to study the impact of R0 on the obtained characteristics for
the optimal epidemic management policy. This is what Fig. 7 represents. It is seen that large variations on R0 do not involve
large variations on the starting day. For instance, moving from R0 “ 2 to R0 “ 3.5 only changes the optimal date by one day
(Day 2 instead of Day 3), which confirms the need to act fastly even when the transmission is more limited (e.g., thanks to

higher temperatures or lower population density). Note that this holds even if the economic impact is accounted for. It is also
good for economical aspects to react fastly to an epidemics. For the optimal reproduction number during lockdown (namely,
R1 ) it is also seen that moving a scenario in which R0 “ 2 to R0 “ 3.5 does not change very significantly the results: the
target severity (or freedom) level would correspond to R1 “ 0.4 instead R1 “ 0.6, which shows that the severity should be
high during lockdown even in countries or regions where transmission is more limited.

the results is seen to be very reasonable and does not affect the main conclusions drawn in the first version of the paper. This
indicates that the conducted analysis is robust against some forms of uncertainties. But of course, as mentioned previously, a
deeper analysis would be required to state more general conclusions.
In addition, a more global sensitivity analysis to other SEIR model parameters, i.e, δ and γ, have been conducted by
simulations. A similar conclusion can be drawn. This shows that our conclusions are quite robust to effects such as parameter
uncertainties. This is in part due to the fact that we are mostly seeking discrete parameters and not continuous parameters,
which creates a form of robustness.
E. Impact of the adjustment phase
Always for the typical scenario presented in the general setting part, Figure 9 depicts the evolution of the number of infected
people (in France) for the policy effectively implemented over the period [March 1, September 30]. Here, only the adjustment
phase is assumed to be optimizable. The figure allows one to quantify the impact of the severity level of the adjustment
phase. Without the adjustment phase, the fraction of infected people is such that the number of people requiring intensive
care exceeds the double of the maximum ICU capacity of France. However, by implementing measures such that Rptq ă 1.2
over the adjustment phase, the constraint on the ICU capacity is not violated by the end of 2020. Furthermore, to avoid the
overwhelming health service for a longer time, it is better to implement measures such that Rptq ă 1 over the adjustment
phase since the fraction of infected people will be non-increasing with Rptq ă 1.
IV. D ISCUSSION
In this work, we propose to model the behavior of a government as far as the epidemic control is concerned. The proposed
model, despite its simplicity, has the merit of being able to capture the fundamental tradeoff between economic and health
aspects. Obviously, to capture other effects such as the psychological effects of measures on people, a more general model should
be considered. The proposed model allows one to provide quantitative answers to issues which have been well commented

in the media. For example, even when a government chooses to assign a high value to the economic aspect, it is seen that
the best strategy is almost always to implement a severe phase as soon as possible. This severe phase involves locking the
population down, as most countries did, or to make intensive use of digital tracing and face masks as South Korea did. In
the latter case, a loss in terms of privacy is the price to be paid for having more freedom. When inspecting the obtained
numerical results performed for France, it is seen that the optimal features for the lockdown/severe phase require targeting a
reproduction number smaller than the one achieved in France (0.4 vs 0.6), while having a shorter duration for the severe
phase (1 month instead of 2). Note that some countries adopted measures which were more severe than France. For instance,
China has been imposing the use of a given food supply system which was very efficient in terms of epidemic mitigation
[28]–[30]. Then, by planning an adjustment phase at the right time, we have seen that as a final result, the number of infected
people can be reduced by a factor of 6 when compared to the current French policy (1.05 million of infected instead of 6.88
millions for the current policy) while having similar GDP losses (231 billions e instead of 241 billions e). We have seen
that by considering a simple model as we have studied, the need for an adjustment phase could have been anticipated. Such
a phase is necessary to avoid the number of patients under intensive care exceeding the capacity of the ICUs. Also, because

11

of the natural tendency of humans to deviate from rules over time, it appears that measures should be updated about every
month and not less frequently.
