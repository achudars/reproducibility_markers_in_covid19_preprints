Abstract
In December 2019, COVID-19 were detected in Wuhan City, Hubei
Province of China. SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread to the whole Chinese
mainland with the people during the Chinese Spring Festival Travel Rush.
As of 19 February 2020, 74576 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been
reported in Chinese Mainland. What kind of cities have more confirmed
cases, and is there any relationship between GDP and confirmed cases? In
this study, we explored the relationship between the confirmed cases of
COVID-19 and GDP at the prefectural-level, found a positive correlation

between them. This finding warns high GDP areas should pay more
prevention and control efforts when an epidemic outbreak, as they have
greater risks than other areas nearby.

Epidemic globally spread in 21st century
Humans are attacked by various epidemic diseases, causing great
disaster to human beings. Only in the 21st century, SARS, MERS and
other diseases have spread globally, and a large number of people
have died. According to World Health Organization (WHO), the
SARS virus in 2003 caused a total of 8,096 SARS cases worldwide,
killed 774 people, involved 29 countries and regions (WHO, 2004).
And the MERS virus caused a total of 2494 cases worldwide, killed
858 people since April 2012 (WHO, 2019).
At the end of 2019, several unexplained pneumonia cases were
found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The clinical manifestations
were mainly fever, combined with symptoms such as dry cough,
fatigue, poor breathing, diarrhea, runny nose, and sputum. Some
patients experienced dyspnea after one week, a large amount of
fibrous exudation in the lungs, and pulmonary fibrosis lesions. In

severe cases, they even died of shock (Huang et al., 2020). In January
2020, researches revealed that a new type of coronavirus caused the
pneumonia (WHO, 2020a). In February 2020, The International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) officially named the
virus SARS-CoV-2, and WHO named pneumonia caused by the
virus as COVID-19.
COVID-19 cases in China
The time of COVID-19 outbreak is at the Chinese Spring
Festival Travel Rush (Chunyun). During this time, many people
back their hometown for celebrating Spring Festival, and the virus
quickly spread from Wuhan to other parts of China with the flow of
people. On January 29, 31 provinces in the Chinese mainland
launched the first level response mechanism for public health
events (the highest). In order to prevent the further spread of the
epidemic, the Chinese government decided to begin strict controls
on entering and leaving Wuhan from January 23, and since then
personnel have rarely continued to flow from Wuhan. As of two
incubation cycles since Wuhan was sealed on January 23, that is,
February 19, a total of 74,577 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in
the Chinese mainland (National Health Commission of the People's
Republic of China, 2020). No matter in Hubei Province where the
outbreak originated or in other provinces, the epidemic situation

varies greatly in their respective regions.
As an important indicator of economic, GDP can also be used
to feedback the vitality of various flows in a region. Figure 1 is a
graph of GDP (a), cumulative confirmed cases (b) of cities in Hubei,
and GDP (c), cumulative confirmed cases (d) of cities outside Hubei.
Figure 1 shows that there is a similar trend between GDP and the
cumulative confirmed cases. Correlation analysis showed that the
relationship between the two reached a very significant positive
correlation. In general, cities with high GDP also have high
confirmed cases. We divide the Chinese mainland cities into two
categories: cities excluding Hubei Province and cities of Hubei
Province, and describe them respectively. Cities outside Hubei
Province, the correlation coefficient between GDP and confirmed
cases is 0.7343 (reached 99% significance level). The cities with the
top-20% GDP have a GDP of 60.65% and confirmed cases of 53.89%,
meanwhile, the cities with the lowest-20% GDP have a GDP of 2.68%
and confirmed cases of 3.30%. Cities of Hubei Province, as the origin
place of the disease, their GDP and confirmed cases also have a
more significant positive correlation, with a correlation coefficient
of 0.9495 (reached 99% significance level).
Demonstration from China
Figure 1 shows that there is a significant positive correlation

between GDP and confirmed cases in different regions of an
epidemic area. According to this finding, the epidemic prevention
and control in different economic development areas in one region
can be graded. In areas with high economic development level, the
epidemic risk is high, and the more active and strict epidemic
prevention measures should be taken. Such as: call on the public to
reduce the flow as much as possible; do a well in personal protection.
Generally speaking, areas with high economic development have
relatively higher flow of people and logistics, which also is a way of
transmission for viruses. Therefore, during the epidemic period, we
should minimize the flow, reduce the aggregation and prevent the
virus from spreading among people. In particular, personal
protection is very important to prevent infection, according to
China's experience. However, some agencies recommend that
healthy people do not wear face masks. But in fact, the role of face
masks is mainly to block the virus, not treat the disease. Wearing a
mask can prevent outside viruses from entering healthy people. It
can also be seen from China's practical experience that wearing face
masks has a significant effect on reducing the spread of the virus
among people.
In developing areas, the risk of epidemic is lower than that of
high economic development areas, but low risk is not without risk.

It is necessary to strengthen the publicity of the people and improve
the awareness of prevention. Establish the concept of "if you don't
pay attention to viruses, they will pay attention to you", guide the
public to do a well personal protection, and isolate the cases early
to prevent the epidemic from spreading internally.
