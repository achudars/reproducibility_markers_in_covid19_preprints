Abstract: Fraud acts as a major deterrent to a company’s
growth if uncontrolled. It challenges the fundamental value of
“Trust” in the Insurance business. COVID-19 brought additional
challenges of increased potential fraud to health insurance
business. This work describes implementation of existing and
enhanced fraud detection methods in the pre-COVID-19 and
COVID-19 environments. For this purpose, we have developed an
innovative enhanced fraud detection framework using actuarial
and data science techniques. Triggers specific to COVID-19 are
identified in addition to the existing triggers. We have also
explored the relationship between insurance fraud and
COVID-19. To determine this we calculated Pearson correlation
coefficient and fitted logarithmic regression model between fraud
in health insurance and COVID-19 cases. This work uses two
datasets: health insurance dataset and Kaggle dataset on
COVID-19 cases for the same select geographical location in
India. Our experimental results shows Pearson correlation
coefficient of 0.86, which implies that the month on month rate of
fraudulent cases is highly correlated with month on month rate of
COVID-19 cases. The logarithmic regression performed on the
data gave the r-squared value of 0.91 which indicates that the
model is a good fit. This work aims to provide much needed tools
and techniques for health insurance business to counter the
fraud.
Keywords: Fraud detection framework, Pearson correlation,

(misleading) information, raising a false claim, etc [2]–[4].
Today, economies all over the world are plagued with fraud
that is affecting various aspects of organizations ranging from
financial performance to organizational morale [5].
Insurance fraud is not new to this world. This came into
existence ever since insurance business took the form of a
commercial enterprise. According, to report by “Coalition
Against Insurance Fraud” around 80 billion dollars of fraud is
committed each year across all lines of insurance business [6].
According, to an article by Insurance Business Asia, the
Indian non-life market has seen a market growth of 14.5% [7],
this growth has also generated a humongous amount of data.
Unfortunately, a majority of companies have legacy systems
that do not capture sufficient details to identify fraud. In the
process, companies identify very few cases of fraud and often
it is years later that these cases come into the light[8], [9].
Some companies, on the other hand, have leveraged this data
to improve their fraud management mechanisms, thereby
gaining a competitive advantage over their peers[10]–[12].
Today, due to COVID-19 the current scenario is different
compared to what it was earlier. There are reports which state
that insurers can expect higher fraudulent claims in insurance.
This could bring additional challenges for insurers as the
existing models may not be sufficient to detect or prevent
fraud which will arise out of this situation.
The various effect of COVID-19 on insurance business is
listed below:
 Changes to terms and conditions of the coverage which
triggers loss
 Requesting for coverage extension
 Interpretation of the coverage
 One-off payments such as ex-gratia – setting a threshold
 Actuarial Control Cycle - general commercial and
environmental changes
o economic cycle - no business activity  more
litigation  more crime  fraudulent claims
o underwriting cycle - changing from soft to
hard market i.e. lesser competition, frequency
of claims is higher most claims do not meet
standard criteria
Solvency - more liabilities so company alters balance to
show solvency. More loss  less profit  not solvent 

Implementation of Correlation and Regression Models for Health Insurance Fraud in Covid-19
Environment using Actuarial and Data Science Techniques
This work focuses on applying actuarial and data science
techniques to identify fraudulent cases in COVID-19
environment and establishing its correlation with COVID-19
cases [15], [16], [19]–[23]. There are IX sections in this
paper. Section II explains the motivation for this work.
Section III provides details about the implementation of
existing framework pre-COVID-19. Section IV explains the
implementation of the enhanced framework to identify fraud
during COVID-19 environment. Section V discusses
correlation model for health insurance fraud and COVID-19
cases. Section VI discusses regression models for health
insurance fraud and COVID-19 cases. Section VII describes
the interpretation of the results. Section VIII states the
conclusions based on the work done. Section IX provides a
preview of the future work that is being undertaken in this
area.
II. LITERATURE REVIEW AND MOTIVATION
Fraud is one of the most expensive crime and the effect of it
is felt directly by customers and various other stakeholders.
Due to fraudulent activities, companies face a huge amount of
losses [24][25]. These losses invariably result in an increased
premium for future customers. Fraudsters employ various
types of techniques, strategies and tools to commit fraud.
Some of the most common types of fraud include Health care
fraud, Debit and Credit card fraud, Identity Theft, Health
Insurance fraud, etc.[6][11] Many stakeholders get affected
either directly or indirectly because of fraud. A direct impact
that is faced by the insured is the increase in premium; this
could lead to a knock-on effect for the insurance companies
by a loss in business [26]. It thus becomes very important for a
corporate entity to have an effective fraud management
process to ensure a healthy financial future. A key element
that is required to identify and combat fraud is access to data
and systems. If one has access to the right set of data fields
and has systems equipped with sufficient controls, fraud can
be managed better [3], [17], [18], [23], [27]. Fraud has
become a cause of anxiety for many organizations. In many
companies, fraud is, in most cases, identified only after it has
occurred. Ideally, we should be able to identify fraud before
the damage is done (i.e. identifying proactively). Fraud
detection and as a consequence prevention will help save
organizations large portion of their earnings. This will also
increase the confidence of the organization. A strong fraud
prevention system will increase the confidence of all the
stakeholders including the investor and customer towards the
company. However, existing fraud detection methods may be
insufficient due to challenges posed by COVID-19 [28].
Based on the most relevant studies done in the area of
insurance fraud detection, we have identified various
methodologies which are currently being used. We analysed
this further and arrived at fraud detection and prevention
framework incorporating both actuarial and data science
techniques. Now, this gets enhanced to meet additional
challenges posed by COVID-19 [21], [29], [30]. The concept
is depicted in Figure 1

DOI:10.35940/ijrte.C4686.099320

Figure 1 – Fraud detection concept
In the past, we had seen how the financial crisis of 2008
which lead to recession triggered many individuals to commit
fraud. Association of British Insurers (ABI) reported 107,000
claims as false amounting to a total of £730m during that
period. Looking at the past, insurers can expect similar
situation arising out of COVID-19 which will trigger more
fraudulent claims. The recent study done by Google on search
query showed that there was 125% increase in the number of
users looking for information on how to start a fire, in the last
week of March [31] [19]. This indicates that people are
finding ways of collecting money through insurance by
committing self-staged accidents.
In our previous work we have developed a framework for
fraud detection [29]. This has been enhanced considering the
new challenges and risks that COVID-19 poses. COVID-19
specific triggers are considered and presented in section
IV(A).
III. IMPLEMENTATION OF EXISTING
FRAMEWORK PRE-COVID-19
The framework for fraud detection in pre- COVID-19
environment is given in Figure 2 [29]:

fraud detection analysis. Gradient boosting method is used to
build a fraud detection model [21]. The dataset was divided
into train and test in the ratio of 70:30. To assess the
performance of the model the Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curve is drawn. ROC curve is the plot
between true positive rate and false positive rate for different
threshold. Each point of the graph represents a sensitivity/
specificity pair for a given threshold point. A model is said to
perform good if the area under the curve (AUC) is close to 1.
For the current model, the AUC value was found to be 0.9243.
This means that the model has optimal performance in the
given scenario [21].

Figure 3 – ROC Curve of the model

A. Implementation for fraud prevention using triggers
A mechanism for early detection of the features of a
fraudulent activity will give the company an edge to develop
effective fraud prevention and management system. Such
features are termed as triggers. Identification of these triggers
in various activities within the company would help in taking
required measures for prevention. A tool for detecting triggers
on real time basis is going to be very useful for the
organization.
Some of the triggers identified pre-COVID-19
environment are as follows:
 Abnormally long time off for a given injury
 Multiple medical provider/ opinions
 Applicant fails to sign and put the date in the application
 Submitting fake test reports
 Visible tampering of document
 Hand written bills
 High value bills (very high doctor fee)
It may not be possible to detect fraud in the early stages of
the process in the normal work flow of the organization.
However, it is possible to build a model for early detection of
fraud by using data science techniques.

The other most useful metric used to assess a class
imbalance classification problem is F1-score [30]. The
F1-score for this model was found to be 0.7191.
However, under COVID-19 scenario the existing model
may not perform as expected (shown in the later section). This
is because there may be a completely new type of fraud that is
occurring. The model may need to be retrained to handle the
scenario.
C. Results of implementation pre-COVID-19
Based on the triggers identified in section III(A) and
predictive model in section III(B) a summary of fraudulent
cases in the pre-COVID-19 environment is obtained and

Implementation of Correlation and Regression Models for Health Insurance Fraud in Covid-19
Environment using Actuarial and Data Science Techniques
IV. IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ENHANCED
FRAMEWORK FOR FRAUD IN COVID-19
ENVIRONMENT
An appropriate framework is designed based on the newly
identified triggers as described in the previous section. This
framework is an enhanced and updated version of our
previous works [21], [29]

Figure 4 – Enhanced framework in COVID-19
environment
The central part of the Framework includes fraud
prevention, detection and identification of new prevention
techniques supported by both actuarial and data science
techniques.

Figure 5 – Enhanced framework business view
Figure 5 shows the business view of the enhanced
framework. In the trigger-based prevention stage, additional
triggers specific to COVID-19 have been considered [29].
The results obtained are analysed further to improve the
existing model. There is a feedback mechanism which
requires the business experts to exercise judgement and add
new triggers to the existing model.
The following sub-sections discuss the implementation of
fraud prevention and detection in the COVID-19
environment.
A. Implementation for fraud prevention using triggers
during COVID-19 environment
The first stage of the framework comprises of originating
preventive techniques for potential fraud using a
trigger-based system. Here, the existing triggers need to be
enhanced with COVID-19 specific triggers. Triggers are
parameters or a set of parameters, which can help, identify
and raise alerts for suspicious activities. These can be
managed through an automated system or manually.
Identification of triggers in itself is an enormous task and
requires a thorough understanding of the business processes.
Triggers identified could differ based on the stage in which

Retrieval Number: 100.1/ijrte.C4686099320
DOI:10.35940/ijrte.C4686.099320

the fraud is committed. Some examples include:
 Requesting for coverage extension – more than 30 days
 Requesting for an automatic renewal
 Requesting for one-off payments such as ex-gratia – more
than 10 lakhs
 Reduction of minimum and deposit premiums by more than
5% in comparison to earlier years
 Non-tracking of exposure – decrease in policy count by
more than 10% in the recent 3 months
 Non-isolation – lack of separation between COVID-19
affected lines of business such as travel from the portfolio
Some of the triggers that were used for identifying fraud in
COVID-19 environment are listed below:
Fraud & Abuse related
 Package already taken by same insured with a different
claim ID
 Specific claim has stayed in rejected status for more than 3
months
 Packages used in COVID-19 environment which looks
suspicious
 Highly utilized package were used even more during this
time. The excess is identified as fraud.
Process related
 Claim is submitted after 15 days of Discharge of the
patient, therefore claim has been rejected
 Discharge documents submitted after 15 days of discharge
 Procedure not performed
Eligibility related
 Wrong package blocked
 Oral medication not payable
 Sign and stamp of the district hospital in referral slip not
provided
B. Implementation for fraud detection using a predictive
model during COVID-19 environment
The important step in fraud detection is the identification of
suspicious activities that have a higher probability of being
fraudulent. Detecting an insurance fraud and abuse requires
an in-depth knowledge of the insurance industry. Many
insurance systems have experts who manually review each of
the transactions to check for the suspicious ones. There are
various methodologies that are being used in insurance fraud
detection in recent times, which are as follows:
 Data Science techniques
o Supervised learning
 Classification trees
 Linear regression
 Logarithmic regression
 Isolation trees
 Support vector machine
o Unsupervised learning
 Clustering
 Actuarial techniques
o Random sampling
o Significance testing
o Suspicious scoring
o Applied Statistical Models & Statistical Tests
o Diagnostics & Analysis of Emerging Experience
o Economics Models including
Behavioural Finance
o Extreme Value Theory

C. Determining the rate of COVID-19 cases
The COVID-19 dataset used for this purpose is retrieved
from Kaggle [32]. This data contains day to day numbers of
COVID-19 infected cases, recovered cases and deaths for all
the states of India. For this work, we have taken infected cases
data from 1st March to 31st August which refers to the same
geographical location as of health insurance dataset. Figure 7
shows the plot of the total infected cases of COVID-19 for
this period.

Since, the COVID-19 cases was negligible for the month of
February, we have ignored this and considered data from
March to August. The descriptive statistics of the six months

The results from Table 9 show that the residuals obtained
from logarithmic regression is much lesser compared to linear
regression.

VI. REGRESSION MODELS FOR HEALTH
INSURANCE FRAUD AND COVID-19 CASES
Linear and logarithmic regression is fitted considering data
shown in Table 5 for the month of March to August.
The regression line thus derived is given as:
Linear regression:
y = 5.4124x + 0.0796
where,
y  Predicted fraud cases %
x  Infected COVID-19 cases %

Figure 10 – Residual plot of the linear and logarithmic
model
Figure 10 shows that the residual plot is randomly
distributed for logarithmic regression, which indicates that the
logarithmic model is a better fit.

Correlation coefficient is used to determine the relationship
between the two variables used. It can take the value from the
range -1 to +1. The correlation between COVID-19 and fraud
cases is observed to be 0.86. This means that there is a strong
positive correlation between the two variables. This implies
that with the increase in COVID-19 cases there is a high
degree of chance for the increase of fraudulent cases in health
insurance business. One of the major reasons for this could be
that lockdown during this period has forced many people out
of employment. This in turn might have induced the idea in
many people of earning money by whatever means available.
Upon performing linear and logarithmic regressions in the
dataset, we observed the r-squared value of 0.74 and 0.91
respectively. It is a measure which is used to determine the
percentage of variation for a response variable that is
explained by the explanatory variable. For the results
achieved, it was observed that both the models have a
significantly high r-squared value. However, in comparison
logarithmic regression is a better fit of the two.

Based on the regression line the predicted fraud cases with
the corresponding residuals along with the residual plots are
given in Table 9 and Figure 10:

VIII. CONCLUSION

9.

In this paper, we developed an enhanced fraud detection
and prevention framework, which integrates both actuarial
and data science techniques. We have shown that there is an
increase in fraud rate during COVID-19 scenario. We have
identified various triggers to identify fraud specific to the
business environment during COVID-19. We have also
demonstrated the implementation of fraud detection during
COVID-19 environment. We have established that there is a
high positive correlation between infected cases and fraud
during COVID-19 and also performed regression. We have
demonstrated this by using statistical models and machine
learning techniques applied on health insurance data. Results
indicate that increase in infected COVID-19 cases has a
strong positive correlation with a Pearson coefficient of 0.86
to increase in rate of fraudulent cases and that logarithmic
regression is a better fit with R-squared value of 0.91.
