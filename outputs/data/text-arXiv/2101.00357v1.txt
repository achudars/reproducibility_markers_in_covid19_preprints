Abstract
We develop an air mobility index and use the newly developed Apple’s driving trend index to evaluate the
impact of COVID-19 on the crude oil price. We use quantile regression and stationary and non-stationary
extreme value models to study the impact. We find that both the air mobility index and driving trend index
significantly influence lower and upper quantiles as well as the median of the WTI crude oil price. The
extreme value model suggests that an event like COVID-19 may push oil prices to a negative territory again
as the air mobility decreases drastically during such pandemics.

1. Introduction
Understanding the real-time fuel demand is very important for many reasons. Energy merchants want
to get a trading edge from all possible resources such as thermal images from cameras on pipelines, satellite data tracking worldwide oil tankers, and so on. Another way of quantifying the real-time demand is
by tracking the transportation sector which accounts for the largest share of U.S. petroleum consumption.
In 2019, the transportation sector accounts for 68% of all petroleum consumption in the U.S. Moreover,
finished motor gasoline accounts for about 45% of total U.S. petroleum consumption (U.S. Energy Information Administration). Human mobility trends introduced by Apple Inc. in mid-April can also be used to
understand on-the-spot gasoline consumption data as it captures user activity in searching for directions on
smartphones. In particular, it is of great interest to use such mobility data during and after the COVID-19
lockdowns where the fuel demand fluctuates vigorously (Bildirici et al., 2020, Jefferson, 2020, Ou et al.,
2020).
Apple has introduced the tool to support the impactful work happening around the globe to mitigate
the spread of COVID-19 (Apple, 2020). Using aggregated data collected from Apple maps, this trend is
generated by counting the number of requests made for directions.
To quantify mobility restrictions and social distancing we use Apple mobility trends, in particular driving
trend in US (Apple, 2020). The other important component of fuel consumption is jet fuel consumption
which has been decreased drastically due to COVID-19. Although an average of 24,900 commercial passenger

flights departed U.S. airports each day in January 2020, by July 2020, flight volume had declined to 13,700
per day–51% of the July 2019 level (EIA, 2020a). We introduce a new air mobility index based on temporal
airline network to evaluate the dynamics of daily U.S. flight volumes. A low score of the two indices indicates
that people are following the government’s guidelines on mobility restrictions more and practicing more social
distancing. A high score of the two indices implies lower mobility restrictions and less social distancing. The
objective of this study is to understand the impact of the Apple driving trend index and the newly developed
air mobility index on the crude oil price.
In this paper, first, we investigate the effect of driving trend and air mobility on the different quantiles of
the crude oil price based on the quantile regression model. Second, we evaluate the tail of the crude oil price
using an extreme value model. Generally, extreme value models focus on the upper tail of the distribution.
However, we study the lower tail of the crude oil price and analyze different determinants of extreme lower
crude oil price based on non-stationary extreme value model as discussed in Dey et al. (2020) (Dey et al.,
2020a).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce different measures of mobility
restrictions and social distancing. In Section 3 we describe the data. We discuss the two methods, namely,
quantile regression and extreme value theory, used in the study in Section 4. We report the findings and
describe the results in Section 5. Finally, we conclude in Section 6.

2. Quantification of mobility restrictions and social distancing
To control the spread of COVID-19 different governments have been implementing a variety of mobility
restrictions and social distancing measures (Charoenwong et al., 2020, Fang et al., 2020, Pan et al., 2020,
Setti and Voutilainen, 2020). To quantify the impact of such control measures on human mobility behavior
we utilize the two following mobility indices.
2.1. Apple’s driving trend index
The Apple driving trend represents a relative driving volume of Apple users compared to a baseline
volume on January 13, 2020. In our study we consider weekly average of the Apple driving trend between
January 13, 2020, and August 25, 2020 as a measure of mobility. We name this measure as Apple driving
trend index (ADI). We normalize ADI in week t by adjusting the average ADI and corresponding standard
deviation as
Ht =

ADIt − µADI
,
σADI

(1)

where, µADI and σADI are the mean and standard deviation of ADI between January 13, 2020, and August
25, 2020.

2.2. Air mobility index
In our study, we consider daily flight volumes in the U.S. as a measure of air mobility. To evaluate daily
flight volumes, we introduce a complex network analysis. We define a graph G = (V, E) as a model for a
airline network, with node set V and set of edges E ⊂ V × V such that (u, v) ∈ E represents an edge from
node u to v, u, v = 1, 2, · · · , n. Here, the nodes represent the U.S. airports and if there is a direct flight
between two nodes (i.e., airports) they are connected by an edge. Here |V | is the number of nodes and |E|
is the number of edges in the network. The elements of the n × n-symmetric adjacency matrix, A, of G can
be written as
Aij =



1, if (i, j) ∈ E

(2)


0, otherwise.
We assume that G is undirected i.e., for all euv ∈ E, euv ≡ evu . The degree, du , of a node u is the number
P
of edges incident to u i.e., for u,v ∈ V and e ∈ E, du = u6=v eu,v . We define fd to be the fraction of nodes
u ∈ V with degree du = d. The collection {fd }, d ≤ 0 is called the degree distribution of G (Kolaczyk and
Csárdi, 2014).
Temporal Network is an extension of network analysis which appears in many domains of knowledge such
as finance (Battiston et al., 2010, Zhao et al., 2018), epidemiology (Demirel et al., 2017, Dey et al., 2020b,
Enright and Kao, 2018, Valdano et al., 2015). A temporal network is a network structure that changes in
time, which can be represented with a time indexed graph Gt = (V (t), E(t)), where, V (t) is the set of nodes
in the network at time t, E(t) ⊂ V (t) × V (t) is a set of edges in the network at time t. Here, t is either
discrete or continuous. To quantify the impact of COVID-19 on flight volumes which necessarily determines
the jet fuel demand, we construct two temporal airline network (Gt ) for two different time scale.
First, we develop a weekly airline network (Gtw ) in each week Sunday day (t) between January 13, 2020
and August 25, 2020: Gw = {G1w , . . . , GTw }, where T = 32. We consider the airline network on each Sunday
is an average representation of that week. The number of nodes (|Vtw |), number of edges (|Etw |), and degree
distribution are evaluated in each Gtw .
Figure 1 illustrates the U.S. flight volumes on Feb 2, 2020, and on May 3, 2020. Table 1 shows how
does the degree distribution of the US Airline network change (decrease) due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
For example, the mean number of departed and landed flights in US airport on Feb 2, 2020, is 111, which
reduces to 31 on May 3, 2020. The maximum number of departed and landed flights in a US airport on Feb
2, 2020, was 1,748, whereas, the maximum number of departed and landed flights in a US airport on May
3, 2020, was only 683.
Second, we construct a monthly airline network (Gtm ) on 15th of each month (t) between January 2000
and August 2020: Gm = {G1m , . . . , GTm }, where T = 248. We consider the airline network on 15th of each
month is an average representation of that month. Similarly as Gw , we evaluate the number of nodes (|Vtm |),
number of edges (|Etm |), and degree distribution in each Gtm .
In our study, we consider the number of edges in an airline network at time t as a measure of air mobility.

We name the metrics as air mobility index (AMI). Therefore we define the weekly and monthly air mobility
index as AM Itw = |Etw | and AM Itm = |Etm |, respectively. Similar to Eq. 1, we normalize AM I w and AM I m
as

Ktw =

AM Itw − µAM I w
σAM I w

and Ktm =

AM Itm − µAM I m
,
σAM I m

(3)

where µAM I w , µAM I m and σAM I w ,σAM I m are the mean and standard deviation of AM I w and AM I m
respectively.
2.3. COVID-19 and Mobility trend
We study the impact of COVID-19 variables (C), e.g., weekly U.S. new cases, weekly U.S. new deaths
on U.S. mobility dynamics and social distancing. We standardized each COVID-19 variable as

Ot =

Ct − µC
,
σC

(4)

where, Ct is a COVID-19 variable (weekly US new cases, weekly US new deaths) in week t, µC and σC are
the mean and standard deviation of the corresponding variable between January 13, 2020, and August 25,
2020.
Figure 2 shows the time plots of normalize weekly average of COVID-19 new cases and deaths in 2020,
along with the two mobility indices, i.e., weekly driving trend and weekly air mobility in 2020. Notice that
4

in the first gray region, between late March and middle of May, when the COVID-19 new cases and deaths
jump, the driving trend and air mobility collapse. However, in the second gray region, between the middle
of July and the end of August, even though there are surges in new cases and deaths, driving trend and
air mobility increase gradually. That is, initially a sudden increase in COVID-19 new cases and deaths
negatively influence the driving trend and air mobility, but after a certain period, high COVID-19 new cases
and deaths do not cause lower driving and decrease air mobility.

Figure 2: Time plots of normalize weekly average of COVID-19 variables (new cases and new deaths in the US) and normalize
weekly average mobility metrics from January 2020 to September 2020.

3. Data
The WTI crude oil price ($ per Barrel) is obtained from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA,
2020b). We compute weekly average of WTI crude oil price, P 0 , between January 13, 2020, and August 25,
2020. We normalize weekly WTI crude oil price Pt0 in week t as
Pt =

Pt0 − µP 0
,
σP 0

(5)

where, µP 0 and σP 0 are the mean and standard deviation of P 0 between January 13, 2020, and August 25,
2020.
Apple mobility data are obtained from Apple mobility trends reports (Apple, 2020). Air mobility index is
based on two types of data: airline On-Time Performance Data and airport coordinate data. The flight data
are obtained from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) (BTS, 2020). And, U.S. airport coordinate
data are obtained from a geospatial data management platform named Koordinates (Koordinates, 2020).
We obtain U.S. COVID-19 data from Our World in Data (World, 2020).

4. Methodology
We evaluate the impact of driving trends and air mobility on WTI crude oil prices. First, we apply the
quantile regression methodology to evaluate the effects of driving trend and air mobility volume on WTI
crude oil price. Second, we quantify the left tail or extreme lower quantiles of the WTI crude oil price
associated with the COVID-19 pandemic with nonstationary extreme value models.
4.1. Quantile Regression
Quantile regression is a generalization of linear regression. Whereas the classical least squares regression
estimates the conditional mean of the response variable, quantile regression estimates the conditional median
and other quantiles of the response variable. That is, quantile regression constructs a set of regression lines for
different quantiles of the conditional distribution of the dependent variable. Unlike least squares regression,
quantile regression does not depend on the particular parametric assumption for the dependent variable and
it also avoids constant variance assumption (Fasiolo et al., 2020, Koenker and Hallock, 2001, Koenker and
Xiao, 2002, Meinshausen, 2006).
We can model a τ th quantile of a response variable y given a particular value of the predictor variable,
X = x, as
QY (τ |x) = β0 (τ ) + β1 (τ )x1 + β2 (τ )x2 ,

(6)

where τ ∈ (0, 1), Y stands for weekly WTI crude oil price (P ), X1 is driving trend (H), and X2 is air
mobility (K w ) (Koenker, 2005).
The parameters can be estimated by solving the equation
V̂ (τ ) = argmin
b

n
X

ρτ (yi − xTi b)

i=1

where,
ρτ (z) =



τ z,

if z ≥ 0


(τ − 1)z, if z < 0.
Koenker and Machado (1999) define a goodness of fit of the quantile regression model by comparing its
error sum of squares with error sum of squares of a restricted form of the model. In our study, we define
n
P
a restricted model which only include an “intercept” as QY (τ |x) = β0 (τ ) with Ṽ (τ ) = argminb0
ρτ (yi −

xTi b0 ). We compute the Pseudo R2 of the model defined in Equation 6 as
R2 (τ ) = 1 −

4.2. Extreme Value Model
Extreme value models evaluate the tail of a distribution and they have a wide range of applications in
climate and atmospheric science to industrial risks, geosciences, finance, economics, and insurance (CastroCamilo et al., 2018, Castillo et al., 2005, Chen et al., 2019, Das and Dey, 2016, Dey and Das, 2016, Reich
and Shaby, 2019, 2012).
For a sequence of independent random variables, Y1 , Y2 , ..., Yn , with a common distribution function G, let
Mn = max {Y1 , Y2 , ..., Yn } be the maximum of the process over n time units (i.e., block ) of the observations.
For {an > 0} and {bn } then P r {(Mn − bn ) /an ≤ z} → G(z) as n → ∞, where G is a non-degenerate
function. According to the Fisher and Tippett extremal theorem (Fisher and Tippett, 1928), G belongs to
the family of Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. The distribution function of a non-stationary
GEV model can be written as
F (z; µ(t), σ(t), ξ(t))

=

 h
1 i
 z − µ(t) − ξ(t)
,
exp − 1 + ξ(t)
σ(t)

(8)

The GEV parameters µ(t), σ(t), and ξ(t) are functions of time or/and other covariates. The t denotes the
time (e.g., months, year, etc.) over which the maximum is chosen. A more detail about the nonstationary
GEV model and its’ parameters can be found in (Coles, 2001, Dey et al., 2020a). The r-year return level,
i.e., the level expected to be exceeded once every r year, can be defined as
i
−ξ(t)
σ(t) h
zr = µ(t) +
− log 1 − r−1
−1 .
ξ(t)
The probability of an extreme event (z) can be obtained as
(
1 !)

− ξ(t)
µ(t) − z
P (Z > z) = 1 − exp − 1 − ξ(t)
.
σ(t)

(9)

(10)

If µ(t) = µ, σ(t) = σ and ξ(t) = ξ, the non-stationary GEV model becomes stationary GEV model.
We can estimate the GEV model parameters using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). The concept of
return period and return level is used to quantify the likelihood of extreme events.
In our study, we are interested in modeling the lower tail of the WTI crude oil price, P , to evaluate the
impact of social distancing and mobility restrictions (i.e, ADI and AM I) on it. That is, we focus on the
minima of WTI crude oil price over blocks rather than its maxima. The same GEV model settings can be
applied here based on the relation,

Mn0 = min {Y1 , Y2 , ..., Yn } = − max {−Y1 , −Y2 , ..., −Yn } .

(11)

By rearranging, we find
−Mn0 = − min {Y1 , Y2 , ..., Yn } = max {−Y1 , −Y2 , ..., −Yn } .

(12)

Therefore, to evaluate the lower tail of WTI crude oil price we use the GEV model on negative block
minima of WTI crude oil price (Gilleland and Katz, 2016).

5. Results
We examine the effect of mobility restrictions and social distancing due to COVID-19 on WTI crude oil
price. We quantify mobility restrictions and social distancing based on Apple’s driving trend Index and a
newly proposed Air mobility index.

Figure 3: Time plots of normalize weekly average crude oil price ($ per Barrel) and normalize weekly average mobility metrices
from January 2020 to August 2020.

Figure 3 depicts the dynamics of WTI crude oil price, Apple’s driving index, and Air mobility index
from January 2020 to September 2020. It is clear from the figure that the divining trend and air mobility
significantly decreased in March and April of 2020, primarily due to the surge of COVID-19 and related
stay-at-home orders at different states in the U.S. during that period. These confinement measures slumped
the demand for oil and oil products, which results in a collapse in WTI crude oil price. Although the driving
trend increased significantly after restrictions eased, air mobility did not increase much primarily because of
people’s tendency to avoid public transportation. WTI crude oil price gradually increased after lockdown
and other restrictions were relaxed.
We now evaluate the effect of driving and air mobility tend on WTI crude oil price. We develop a
quantile regression model for each of the quantiles τ = (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99) based on Eq. 8. We
are particularly interested in the lower and upper quantile of the WTI crude oil price. Table 2 summarizes
the outputs of the quantile regression models.
We find that both driving trend and air mobility significantly affects lower and upper quantiles as well
as the median of the WTI crude oil price. The coefficients of driving trend and air mobility are all positive.
Therefore, a decrease (increase) in driving trend or air mobility leads to a decrease (increase) in τ th quantiles
of the WTI crude oil price, where τ ∈ (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99). Notice that the coefficient of driving
trend tends to gradually decrease from the lower quantiles to upper quantiles. On the other hand, the
coefficient of air mobility tends to gradually increase from the lower quantiles to the upper quantiles. That

8

is, the driving trend has a greater influence on the lower quantiles of the WTI crude oil price. On the other
hand, air mobility has a higher influence on the upper quantiles of the WTI crude oil price.
The values of R2 are higher in lower quantiles. That is, driving trend and air mobility able to explain
the variability of lower quantiles of WTI crude oil price better compared to its upper quantiles. In our
study, we focus on how does driving trend and air mobility shape the collapse of WTI crude oil price during
the COVID-19 pandemic. The R2 values reveal that the driving trend and air mobility greatly influence
the extreme decrease of WTI crude oil price (lower quantiles) during the pandemic. Figure 4 depicts the
regression lines of WTI crude oil price for different quantiles.

Figure 4: Normalize WTI crude oil prices regression models for different quantile levels.

Now we turn our analysis to evaluate the crash of WTI crude oil price resulting from the COVID-19
pandemic based on the extreme value model. We study monthly minimum crude oil price (Y) for the last
twenty years from 2000 to 2020 and model left tail, i.e., extreme lower quantile of the WTI crude oil price.

9

However, due to the unavailability of Apple’s driving trend index, we only use monthly air mobility K m as a
covariate in the extreme value modeling. Figure 5 shows the time plot of monthly minimum crude oil price
and monthly air mobility (on the 15th of every month) in the U.S. from January 2000 to August 2020.

Figure 5: Monthly minimum crude oil price and monthly air mobility from January 2000 to August 2020.

We experiment a set of of non-stationary extreme value models, Yt0 ∼ GEV (µ(t), σ(t), ξ(t)), where
Yt0 = −Yt , Yt is the monthly minimum crude oil price in month t. We assess the different combinations
of time trends and covariate (air mobility) effect on the monthly minimum crude oil price. We select two
best models based on (smaller) Akiake Information Criterion (AIC) (Akaike, 1998) and Bayesian information
criterion (BIC) (Schwarz, 1978) values. Table 3 describes the selected models along with a baseline stationary
model. Model 1 allows a linear time trend in the location parameter. In Model 2 location parameter depends
linearly on time trend and air mobility. There is a time trend in the log-scale parameter in both models.

Table 4 shows the estimated parameters of Model 1 and Model 2. In Model 2 the covariate air mobility
has a negative effect on monthly minimum WTI crude oil price, where the estimated value of δ is -5.190,
with a standard error of 0.974. Therefore, one unit increase in air mobility moves monthly minimum WTI
crude oil price in opposite direction (decrease) by 5.190 units when covariate (t) held constant. That is, an
increase in air mobility results in an increase in overall WTI crude oil price.
Figure 8 in Appendix represents the goodness of fit plots of the two models. We find that QuantileQuantile (Q-Q) plots for both Model 1 and Model 2 approximately 45-degree line. The observed versus
fitted density plot for both models also yield that both Model 1 and Model 2 capture the variability of the
monthly minimum WTI crude oil price.

We compute the return level, i.e., the extreme lower quantile of WTI crude oil price which is expected to
fall below on average once every r year using Eq. 9. The return levels zr based on Model 1 depend on time
t. That is, for certain values of t we can compute return levels of crude oil price for different return periods.
The return levels based on Model 2 depend on time t as well as on monthly air mobility. Table 5 represents
two scenarios of the covariates and their corresponding 10, 20, 50, and 100 years return levels.

Based on Model 1, for t corresponds to April 2020, the estimate of the crude oil price that we expect to
fall below once every 10, 20, 50, and 100 years are 27.826, 17.049, 8.5499, and 4.687, respectively. Notice
that the minimum crude oil price in April 2020 was 6.65 and the 100-year return level is 4.687. Therefore,

based on Model 1, we can say that the minimum oil price in April 2020 is a 100-year event, which is also
clear in Figure 6. However, when we include monthly air mobility as a covariate in the model (Model 2), we
find that return levels fall dramatically. For the values of t and N in April 2020, the 10 and 20 years return
levels are 12.687 and 4.517, respectively. Therefore, lower air mobility ( Model 2) makes the minimum oil
price in April 2020 a 20-year event. That is, lower air mobility increases the risk of occurring a very low oil
price. Figure 7 depicts how a very low oil demand (i.e., oil demand in April 2020) causes frequent lower oil
prices.
We have also found that Model 2 predicts 50-yr return and 100-yr return levels as -1.801 and -4.615,
respectively. Therefore, there is a risk of occurring a negative oil price -1.801 in every 50 years, and a negative
oil price -4.615 in every 100 years, if there is very low air mobility, i.e., K m = 8, 643 (with a time trend
t = 244).

6. Conclusion
To the best of the author’s knowledge, the proposed air mobility index and Apple’s driving trend index
have not been used to study the impact of COVID-19 on crude oil prices. We use the concept of temporal
network to develop the air mobility index. We use quantile regression to evaluate the effects of driving trend
and air mobility volume on WTI crude oil price. Based on the results obtained from quantile regression, we
claim that driving trend has a higher influence on lower quantiles of crude oil prices whereas air mobility
has a higher influence on upper quantiles of crude oil prices. We also quantify the tail or extreme quantiles
of the WTI crude oil price associated with the COVID-19 pandemic by stationary and non-stationary GEV

models. We conclude that with COVID-19, an already volatile oil market has reached a flashpoint. Although
oil prices have recovered significantly in the past couple of months, it is unlikely that there will be the same
buoyancy in prices as witnessed following the previous global economic recessions such as the Great Recession
in 2008.
