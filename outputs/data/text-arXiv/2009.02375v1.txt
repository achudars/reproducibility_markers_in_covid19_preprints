Abstract
Typically, mathematical simulation studies on COVID-19 pandemic forecasting are
based on deterministic differential equations which assume that both the number (n) of
individuals in various epidemiological classes and the time (t) on which they depend are
quantities that vary continuous. This picture contrasts with the discrete representation
of n and t underlying the real epidemiological data reported in terms daily numbers
of infection cases, for which a description based on finite difference equations would
be more adequate. Adopting a logistic growth framework, in this paper we present
a quantitative analysis of the errors introduced by the continuous time description.
This analysis reveals that, although the height of the epidemiological curve maximum
c
is essentially unaffected, the position T1/2
obtained within the continuous time rep-

resentation is systematically shifted backwards in time with respect to the position
d predicted within the discrete time representation. Rather counterintuitively, the
T1/2
c − T d < 0 is basically insensitive to changes
magnitude of this temporal shift τ ≡ T1/2
1/2

in infection rate κ. For a broad range of κ values deduced from COVID-19 data at
extreme situations (exponential growth in time and complete lockdown), we found a

1

rather robust estimate τ ≃ −2.65 day−1 . Being obtained without any particular assumption, the present mathematical results apply to logistic growth in general without
any limitation to a specific real system.

Introduction

Since the COVID-19 infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) broke out in Wuhan City, the capital of Hubei province of
China, 1,2 on December 2019 and WHO declared it a pandemic, 3,4 collaborative work was
conducted worldwide by research institutions and pharma industry aiming at developing
antiviral medication and vaccine in the global battle against this unprecedented dangerous
threat to planet’s life. Along with such effort whose concrete results are still to come,
mathematical simulation can significantly assist governments in adopting the most adequate
solutions to suppress infection spread and minimize medical burden as well as dramatic
economic and social consequences.
Most population dynamics studies on COVID-19 pandemic as well as on other epidemics
carried out in the past adopted a mathematical framework based on a continuous time picture. This is particularly comfortable because it enables to derive the temporal evolution of
the populations of various epidemiological compartments by solving a set ordinary differential equations. Still, a more realistic approach should aim at quantitatively predicting or at
least reproducing the new infection cases, and these are reported daily. Therefore, a discrete
time representation appears to be more adequate. From this perspective, quantifying the
errors arising from the simplified continuous time assumption is a significant question that
deserves consideration. However, to the best of author’s knowledge, this issue was not addressed in previous COVID-19 studies. For this reason, it represents the focus of the present
2

paper.

The Logistic Model

Evolution in time of epidemics was extensively investigated in the literature, most often
within the celebrated SIR model or many of its extensions. 5–10 An important problem with
such approaches is the (too) large number of input parameters they need in order to make
reliable predictions, and their values are difficult to validate before disease end. 11
For this reason, we will adopt here the simpler logistic growth model. 12–15 Along with
numerous applications in various other fields, 16–21 this model turned out to be also useful
in previous studies on epidemics, 22–25 also including COVID-19 pandemic. 26–28 As compared
to various SIR-based approaches, the logistic growth model possesses a great advantage: it
can be directly validated against ongoing epidemiological reports. 28
In the continuous time description, logistic growth in time of an infected population obeys
a first-order differential equation

n
d
n = κn 1 −

N

(1)

Here, κ stands for the intrinsic infection rate, which characterizes the unlimited exponential
(Malthus-type) population increase occurring in an infinite environment. In real situations,
exponential growth is suppressed because the effective infection rate κ̃ = (dn/dt)/n gradually decreases as the number of infections increases. The parenthesis entering the RHS of
equation (1) resembles the Pauli blocking factor passionately discussed in charge transport
in Fermi systems. 29–33 It represents the simplest possible way to model a population dependent infection rate κ̃ = f (n), namely to assume that it linearly decreases as n increases and
eventually levels off at the maximum value N, which defines the so-called carrying capacity.
Epidemiologists refer to n = n(t) as the total (cumulative) number of cases and to
ṅ(t) ≡ dn(t)/dt as the daily number of (new) infections. The latter term stems from discrete

Notice that, whether in continuous or discrete time, in addition to the two model parameters
κ and N, an “initial” condition is needed to determine the time evolution n = n(t) via
equations (1) or (3), respectively. Most commonly this is imposed by

n0 = n(t)|t=0

Results and Discussion

Inspection of equations (1) or (3) reveals that results for the normalized number of cumulative
cases n(t)/N and daily cases (ṅ/N or [n(t + 1) − n(t)] /N, respectively) as a function of the
reduced time t/T1/2 can be depicted as curves depending on a single parameter, namely κ;
the value n0 /N merely serves to appropriately set the time origin. To be specific, guided by
our recent study, 28 in all the figures presented below we used n0 /N ≈ 1/1500. However, as
just said, this particular choice does by no means affect the generality of the results reported
below.
To start our analysis, we chose a value of infection rate κ = 0.14 day−1 , which turned
out to describe a regime of moderate restrictions during Slovenia COVID-19 epidemic. 28
Results for the cumulative and daily number of cases obtained within the continuous time
and discrete time using the value κ = 0.14 day−1 can be compared in Figs. 1b and 2b,
respectively. These figures reveal a certain backward shift of the continuous time curves
with respect to the discrete time curves.
Based on naive intuition it seems reasonably to expect that situations corresponding
slower temporal variations (smaller infection rates κ) can more appropriately be described
quantitatively within a continuous time representation than those characterized by faster
variations (larger κ values). To check whether this is the case or not, we monitored how
results change by increasing κ. Results for the larger value κ = 0.28 day−1 are depicted
in Figs. 1c and 2c. They show backward shifts larger than for κ = 0.14 day−1 . Further
increasing κ to the value κ = 0.42 day−1 (Figs. 1d and 2d) confirms this trend. On the
contrary, the curves computed for the smaller value κ = 0.07 day−1 (Figs. 1a and 2a) reveal
that the backward shift is smaller. So far, so good; the intuitive expectation is supported
by these calculations. The curves based on continuous time exhibits a systematic shift
backwards in time whose magnitude varies monotonically with κ. Noteworthily, the behavior
displayed in Figs. 1 and 2 refers to quantities plotted against the reduced time t/T1/2 .
Surprise arises when examining the curves plotted with the absolute time t on the abscissa

rather than the reduced time t/T1/2 . The difference visible in Figs. 1 and 2 is not so clear
when using t instead of t/T1/2 on the x axis (see Fig. 3a). However, it becomes observable
when the curves are shifted by T1/2 , that is, are plotted versus t − T1/2 (see Fig. 3b) Still,
the κ-dependence of the peak heights (they are proportional to κ, see equation (5)) makes
observation somewhat difficult.
Finally, the point we want to make is obvious in Fig. 3c. For a very broad range of
κ-values, the maximum of the epidemiological curves deduced within the continuous time
description is shifted backward in time by the κ-independent amount τ ≃ −2.65 day while its
height (=maximum number of daily new cases) cannot be distinguished from that predicted
within the (realistic) discrete time description. Concerning the κ-independence of τ , one
should note that that the above value κ = 0.42 day−1 corresponds to a regime wherein
infections were found to growth exponentially in time while κ = 0.07 day−1 is almost half
the κ-value at complete lockdown. 28
To conclude, the above finding contradicts the expectation based on naive intuition that
faster population dynamics is poor(er) describable in continuous time, or, put differently,
that slower infections are better described within a continuous time approach.

A Technical Remark

In arriving at equation (2), we chose the forward (finite) difference n(t+ 1) −n(t) to establish
the correspondence between the discrete time and continuous time versions of logistic growth.
This procedure is just in the vein underlying the logistic growth philosophy. The LHS of
equation (1) is nothing but the number of new daily cases. Via equation (1), this number
is assumed to be proportional to the number of total of existing infections n(t) as long as
the latter are few. Otherwise, the gradual increase in the fraction of the already infected
individuals n(t)/N reduces the probability for further infection.
Purely mathematically speaking, as alternatives to the forward difference (dn(t)/dt →

n(t + 1) − n(t)), we could have chosen the backward finite difference (dn(t)/dt → n(t) −
n(t − 1)) or the symmetric finite difference (dn(t)/dt → [n(t + 1) − n(t − 1)] /2).
The backward difference leads to

Although difference in numerical results obtained by employing equation (8) and equation (2)
are not notable, equation (8) does complain neither with the idea of logistic growth (see
above) nor to the causality principle.

(9)

the symmetric finite difference (which is a better choice for calculating numerical derivatives
in other cases) is even more problematic here. In addition to the drawback noted in connection with equation (8), unrealistically, the symmetric difference version of equation (9) does
not allow to uniquely predict time evolution n(t) merely based on a single initial condition
(n(0) = n0 ); equation (9) is a relationship between populations at three consecutive days:
n(t + 1), n(t), and n(t − 1).

Conclusion

Based on the present results obtained within a logistic growth model, we conclude that
the most notable inaccuracy brought about by the continuous time description of epidemics
— which is mathematically more convenient than the discrete time description — is the

prediction that the maximum number ṅ of daily infections occurs earlier in time: T1/2

independent of the infection rate κ ranging from large values deduced for situations where

COVID-19 infections growth exponentially in time to small values obtained at complete
lockdown. 28 This finding contradicts naive intuition expecting that faster infections (larger
κ) are poorer described within continuous time approaches than slower infections (smaller
κ).
To end, let us emphasize that, although conducted in conjunction with the actual unprecedented crisis caused by COVID-19 pandemic, the present study reports results applying
to logistic growth in general. No specific reference to a special real system was needed in the
mathematical derivation presented above.
