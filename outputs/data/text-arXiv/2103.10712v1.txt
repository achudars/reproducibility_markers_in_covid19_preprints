Abstract
In a recent paper, Jean Gaudart and colleagues studied the factors associated with the spatial
heterogeneity of the first wave of COVID-19 in France. We make some critical comments on their
work which may be useful for future, similar studies.

Explaining the ravages of the covid-19 epidemic and the greater or lesser success in combating it will
be of interest in months and probably years to come. The study of Gaudart and colleagues1
represents a worthy effort to identify factors that aggravate mortality due to the epidemic, but we
have some critical comments on it which may be useful for similar studies. The first one concerns the
statistical methods: What makes things ‘scientific’ (irrespectively of their being correct or not) is not
the collecting of data, not the formulating of hypotheses, not the use of computation, but the
reasoning in them. Although the models and methods used in the study are enumerated, there is
little or no reasoning behind them; we doubt that there could be any, but it is the burden of
justifying the models (of showing that they correspond, in some sense, with the data) that lies with
the authors rather than the burden of disproving them that lies with the readers. It is true that the
authors follow common practice, but that is no excuse because our objections are well known:2,3,4,5
in particular, p-values may be small for no reason other than that the models under which they are
computed are wrong, and despite sensitivity and analyses of residuals to confirm that they are
approximately right; and to the best of our knowledge the software ‘dagitty’ is meant to identify sets
of variables the conditioning upon which permits the estimation of a causal effect, but this
presupposes a model for the relationships of cause and effect between variables, while, for example,
in the model represented by graph A of the appendix ‘economic indicators’ can hardly be thought to
cause ‘population age structure’ (surely there are causal relations between these two, but they are
‘dynamic’ and far too complicated to be compressed into a single, one-sided relation). Classical
‘model building’ techniques for arriving at approximately correct models and for defending them
could be useful, but they are exacting and are hardly applicable to situations involving more than
just a few variables.6 Older methods involving stratification on ‘background’ variables combined with
permutation versions of non-parametric tests avoid or greatly reduce biases in p-values, but the
associations they yield normally retain some confounding (their use implying no pretension to
remove confounding to the point of exhibiting ‘pure’ or causal relations, which in any case is
impossible in most observational studies), and we are not sure that they could have served the
analyses of Gaudart and colleagues which are based on 90 to 100 sampling units (the French
departments). Despite this relatively small sample size, perhaps statistical prediction analyses based
on a non-parametric algorithm would provide clear information about which variables are most
useful to predict incidence, mortality and fatality rates, and about how accurate the predictions of

these outcomes are. Used in this study, analyses of this kind (which derive evidence from various
estimates of prediction accuracy rather than from p-values) would yield predictions at each location
based on ‘training data’ consisting of the outcomes and predictor variables (the regional centroid,
economic indicators, etc.) from the other locations, and the accuracy of the predictions could be
quantified overall and geographically. In particular, random forest5 might give reasonably accurate
predictions, and with them a meaningful ranking of the variables according to their predictive value,
which is not so readily or accurately obtainable from the models fitted by the authors. (In principle,
prediction analyses could be carried out with the models used in the paper, but a cross-validation
procedure properly accounting for the ‘model building’ would require more data.)
It is unreasonable to expect evidence for clear-cut causal effects in an observational study like this
(studies which provide that being exceptional), and finding associations is a perfectly legitimate and
most useful goal, certainly if the findings can be given some sort of causal explanation. Despite the
criticism vented above, the associations presented by the authors seem genuine and to have been
given mostly correct (though necessarily partial) causal interpretations when appropriate. However,
a couple of important statements in the paper seem inaccurate to us and certain of its conclusions
are not correct or at least not warranted by the study, which brings us to the second part of our
comment.
It is said that “Case fatality rate was not associated with the initial number of intensive care beds,
suggesting that hospitals could rapidly scale up their capacities and organise medical evacuations to
less affected areas.” The authors mean to say that they have found no evidence for the association,
and yet interpret the non-rejection of a null hypothesis by a positive statement about how events
turned out. We think that such a suggestion requires further qualification, and that the events it
refers to are best described by collecting and analyzing testimonies of those involved in them, as in a
historical investigation. In this connection it is also said that “the number of ICU beds available in
2018 was not associated with mortality or case fatality rate”, but the association in question may
exist and escape detection. And while the statement that “we found no association between
baseline population health and health-care services and incidence and mortality rates” offers no
doubts, the authors revert to a positive, seemingly unwarranted statement: “This finding suggests
that hospitals managed to scale up their ICU capacity (≥100% increase in 21 departments; appendix
p 19) or organise medical evacuations to less affected departments when necessary.”
The authors say that the time “between the first COVID-19-associated death and the onset of the
lockdown appeared to be positively associated with in-hospital incidence, mortality, and case fatality
rates”. This is alright, but as far as we can see it need not imply anything about the lockdown: the
interval of time seems to indicate how early the infection had been around. So the following seems
unwarranted: “In other words, morbidity and mortality were lower in departments where the
general lockdown caught the epidemic at an earlier stage of its expansion. This finding suggests that
the lockdown was an effective way to control the diffusion of this wave of the epidemic across the
country.” If the interval had been defined with respect to an event other than the lockdown then the
association would still have been detected. As to a ‘pure’ effect of the lockdown (supposedly
separate from other effects, such as the general alarm or the self-imposed effort of many families to
protect their own elderly), we wonder whether this can ever be determined; at any rate, and
although it is hard to imagine that the lockdown had no consequences in France, it seems well to
report that even now there are studies, also based on statistical parametric models, which draw
different conclusions about those consequences.7 Incidentally, the authors say that “our ecological
study was not designed to assess the effectiveness of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine against

COVID-19 at the individual level; these drugs have been shown not to be effective”, so it may be well
to add that on this subject too there continue to be different opinions.8
The authors end the paper by saying that “In conclusion, our findings outline the effect of the
COVID-19 pandemic wave in a country that could absorb the shock, thanks to a strong hospital
system and a national lockdown. However, the findings indirectly underscore the weakness of its
preventive and public health system, which could be useful for informing countries’ preparedness
for the current or future pandemic waves.” The first statement appears to include a value judgement
and an attribution of cause, neither of which is warranted by the study; the second is similar in
nature but seems to be contrary in meaning.
Our last point is more of a recommendation since it concerns factors which, probably because data
on them were not available at the time, have not been considered in this study and which in our
view could be important in future studies. Evidence from East Asia9,10,11,12 suggests that early
treatment, isolation and accompaniment of covid-19 patients, even of those not, or not yet, showing
serious symptoms, is important for reducing mortality and transmission, and accordingly, already by
April 2020, scientists and practitioners, such as Dr. X. Pothet, urged authorities in France to take
heed of that evidence12,13. Despite possible social and climatic particularities of the country, the
apparent success of Singapore in dealing with the epidemic supports the idea that treating patients
as early as possible in or out of hospital instead of asking them to quarantine as long as their
symptoms are mild, is an effective way of reducing mortality:
“The majority of patients picked up by our testing have mild or no symptoms. Such patients are
generally admitted to a Community Care Facility (CCF) where most recover with minimal
intervention. Patients in these facilities are monitored closely in case they need to be transferred
14,15
to hospital for better management and support.”;
“Thus, triaging becomes very important. The duration from the initial symptoms of COVID-19 to
respiratory failure in most patients is ~ 7 days […]. Many patients go on to develop ‘silent
hypoxemia’, so-called because of its insidious and hard-to-detect nature. It has been reported
that unlike pneumonia due to other infections, COVID-19 pneumonia patients may not feel
dyspnoeic or any noticeable discomfort in chest. The physical manifestations become evident
16
when pneumonia has deteriorated to moderate-to-severe levels”;
“Since the chain of events triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection evolves quickly, any planned
intervention must come as early as possible. Besides, since the pathogenesis of COVID-19
involves non-viral mechanisms, any intervention planned must also address the correction or
modulation of these disbalances. Hence, any therapeutic intervention must be early and
combine antiviral and adjuvant therapies. However, the moment of diagnosis and eventual
11
hospital admission will mark the timeframe of interventions” .

So it may be that, in addition to age, comorbidities and the time since the beginning of the epidemic,
the best predictors of mortality and fatality rate are the type of treatment and the stage of the
disease at which treatment is provided, to the extent that the inclusion of these variables in
prediction analyses will reveal those outcomes to be quite predictable. As Gaudart and colleagues
point out, the criteria for admission to hospital varied across departments, and the provision of
treatment in general, in or out of hospital, must have varied as well, in space and also in time, and so
too must have varied the protocols for treating covid-19 patients. Thus, these variations, not only
within France but between countries, should offer opportunities for identifying the most important
contributors to mortality due to covid-19. Of course, the reliability of data on the factors in question

is important, as is the resolution at which they or their substitutes are available; but there ought to
be records of, and testimonies about, the criteria for the provision of treatment and the protocols
adopted by the various health care institutions for treating patients during the epidemic, from which
suitable variables can be distilled, and at a more detailed level than the departmental one. A
recognition of the importance of the timely provision of treatment of covid-19 might even turn out
to extend to other infectious diseases, which would strengthen current calls for a ‘paradigm shift’ in
infection management.17
