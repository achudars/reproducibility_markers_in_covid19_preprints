To quantify the fate of respiratory droplets under different ambient relative humidities, direct
numerical simulations of a typical respiratory event are performed. We found that, because small
droplets (with initial diameter of 10 µm) are swept by turbulent eddies in the expelled humid puff,
their lifetime gets extended by a factor of more than 30 times as compared to what is suggested
by the classical picture by William F. Wells, for 50% relative humidity. With increasing ambient
relative humidity the extension of the lifetimes of the small droplets further increases and goes up to
around 150 times for 90% relative humidity, implying more than two meters advection range of the
respiratory droplets within one second. Employing Lagrangian statistics, we demonstrate that the
turbulent humid respiratory puff engulfs the small droplets, leading to many orders of magnitude
increase in their lifetimes, implying that they can be transported much further during the respiratory
events than the large ones. Our findings provide the starting points for larger parameter studies and
may be instructive for developing strategies on optimizing ventilation and indoor humidity control.
Such strategies are key in mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic in the present autumn and upcoming
winter.

Tiny saliva and mucus droplets play a crucial role
in the transmission of the disease SARS-CoV-2 [1–13].
Hitherto laboratory studies have focused on the virological side, by investigating the viral load of the droplets
[14]. Unfortunately, detailed knowledge on the realistic
fates of respiratory droplets once they have been expelled
is surprisingly sparse. Past studies have been limited
in their ability to fully capture the turbulent flows that
transport droplets, usually resorting to models [15, 16].
Such detailed knowledge, however, is vital to reduce the
number of infections and the reproduction factor R of
COVID-19. Whilst transmission of respiratory diseases
depends on numerous factors, including infectivity and
transmissability of the pathogen, one key question intimately related to the mode of transmission, is that of
fluid dynamics and flow physics: How do the turbulent vapour puff and ambient conditions influence the
evaporation rate and thus the lifetime of the respiratory
droplets?
The understanding of the fate of respiratory droplets
is based on the classical picture by William F. Wells in
1930s [15, 17], which – at that time in connection with
the transmission of tuberculosis – was the following: The
drops produced by sneezing, coughing and even speaking
would have a wide size distribution and would fly out of
the mouth and nose without much interaction between
them. The small droplets would hardly be a problem because they would evaporate very quickly in the air and
leave dry and therefore – as was thought – less dangerous
airborne particles behind, while the large droplets would
behave ballistically. To-date, on the basis of the classi-

cal picture by Wells and early experimental studies [8],
authorities have implemented the social distance guidelines such as the six-foot rule, to reduce the spread of
COVID-19.
However, in recent months the empirical evidence that
the six-foot rule is not sufficient to protect against infection with the coronavirus has kept on accumulating and
various so-called super-spreading events have been reported, see e.g. [18–27], all of them indoors. Indeed, over
the last years L. Bourouiba and coworkers have shown
[2, 28–30] that the range and the lifetime of the cloud
of tiny saliva and mucus droplets (referred to as respiratory droplets in this paper) is much larger than what
the 6-foot rule assumes, namely up to 8 meters and up
to 10 minutes, instead of one to two meters and less than
one second. The reason justified by these studies is that
the respiratory droplets are expelled together with warm
and humid air, which considerably delays their evaporation. In a dense spray, Villermaux and coworkers [31, 32]
pointed out that the lifetime of droplets is determined
by the lifetime of the humid vapour plume in which the
droplets are embedded, rather than by the so-called “d2 law” which only applies to an isolated evaporating spherical droplet, whose square of its diameter d linearly decreases with time [33] and on which the estimates by
Wells [15, 17] were based.
Interestingly, in spite of the major research effort of
the last months in particular, the role of environmental factors such as humidity and temperature remains
controversial and inconclusive [34–36], motivating several studies to focus on mathematical models. The main

difficulty in getting conclusive and reproducible results
originates from the lack of controlled conditions under
which the spreading events occur. Also, even with controlled and reproducible conditions, following and quantifying the properties of 1000s of microdroplets in space
and time remains extremely challenging from an experimental point-of-view. High fidelity numerical datasets
are thus crucial in order to pinpoint the exact flow physics
that determine the droplet evaporation.
In this Letter, we perform direct numerical simulations
(DNS) of a turbulent respiratory event and follow the
evolution of microdroplets in turbulent flow using the
point particle approach. In contrast to the classical picture by Wells, we show that the lifetime of droplets can
be significantly extended in the presence of the turbulent vapour puff, which we quantify, for the first time,
by tracking the Lagrangian statistics of droplets in our
DNS. Existing numerical studies on this topic, moreover,
typically do not resolve small scales of turbulent mixing
processes–a crucial mechanism for the droplet evaporation. Examples of these studies include Euler-Lagrangian
approaches with a steady-state jet profile for a single
droplet [16, 37], for multiple droplets [38–40] and large
eddy simulations (LES) [41]. Mathematical models are
appealing because of their simplicity [42–45], however,
fitting parameters must be calibrated by validating with
high fidelity simulations and experiments. Newer DNS
with turbulence are emerging [46, 47], but full quantification of the Lagrangian statistics is still limited. Therefore, the quantitative results obtained here are an important step towards developing a theoretical model on

predicting spatial and temporal droplet or aerosol concentrations around a respiratory event.
We simulated a turbulent humid puff sustained over
a duration of 0.6 s into ambient air and laden with 5000
water droplets, mimicking a strong jet-like cough [28, 48].
In addition to the droplets, the turbulent puff expels hot,
vapor saturated air with an initial temperature 34 °C and
relative humidity 100% [28]. Both temperature and vapor fields are buoyant. In reality, no two coughs are
alike, and deviations from our assumed parameters can
exist. Here, to make our simulations tractable, we have
chosen parameters that are representative of a cough
from experiments [49, 50]. As reference ambient conditions, we chose the ambient temperature of 20 °C and
varied relative humidity between 50% and 90%, covering typical indoor ambient conditions. The background
airflow conditions can also be an important factor, e.g.
with or without ventilation [51]. Here we chose a quiescent background field, but different types of ventilation
could be embodied straightforwardly. We use our highly
efficient and parallelized finite difference Navier-Stokes
solver (“AFiD”) based on a second-order finite difference
scheme [52], coupled to the advection equations for tem-

perature and vapor concentration, both in Boussinesq
approximation [53]. Details of the numerical scheme and
setup are given in the Supplementary Material.
We first describe our results for fixed ambient relative humidity of RH = 50%, visualized in Fig.1. Within
about 400 ms from the start of the cough, droplets larger
than about 100 µm are observed to immediately fall out
from the ‘puff’, basically behaving ballistically due to
their own weight. The associated distances of this fallouts typically range between 0.1 m and 0.7 m from the
source (Fig.1b). Indeed, this type of fallout has already
been predicted in the 1930s by Wells [15, 17], and also
demonstrated in the cough and sneeze experiments by
[28]. These typical distances appear to be the basis of the
spatial separation guidelines issued by the World Health
Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, and European Centre for Disease Prevention
and Control on respiratory protection for COVID-19 [8].
However, droplets of order of 10 µm behave in a completely different way. The pathlines traced by smaller
droplets remain largely horizontal and form spirals, indicating close correlation with the turbulent puff. The
physical explanation here is that smaller droplets settle
much slower than the characteristic velocity of the surrounding fluid, and are therefore advected further by the
local turbulent flow. This mechanism is intimately related to the ‘airborne’ transmission route for infectious
diseases [54].
That the smaller droplets tend to remain inside the
humid puff has dramatic consequences on their lifetimes,
which far exceed those of isolated droplets (Fig.2a,d).
For RH = 50%, the droplets of 10 µm can live up to 60
times longer than the expected value by Wells, whereas
for RH = 90%, it can even become 100 to 200 times
longer. These extended lifetimes are also confirmed by
the much slower shrinkage rates of the droplet surface
area as compared to the corresponding rate determined
from the d2 -law, which is valid for isolated droplets and
which is the basis for Wells’ theory, see Fig.2b,e.
We now further describe the flow physics contributing
to this highly extended lifetime of the small droplets. The
first physical factor depends on the motion of droplets
relative to their surrounding fluid. As shown in Fig.1b,
smaller droplets have the tendency to be captured by the
turbulent puff and move together with the fluid. This
is the well-known phenomenon for small Stokes number
particles, defined as a ratio of droplet response timescale
to the flow timescale. This gives rise to smaller relative
velocities and hence less evaporation due to the reduction
of convective effects. In contrast, larger droplets tend to
fly and settle faster than the surrounding fluid, thus evaporating faster than predicted by the d2 -law, because the
convective effects, carrying the evaporated vapor away
from the droplet, are dominant. This rapid evaporation
is shown in the faster shrinkage rate of the droplet surface
areas in Fig.2b,e.

humidity which can protect the droplets from shrinking. The
vertical dashed line indicates the moment at which the coughing stops. (c,d) Count histogram of droplets in the entire

expected droplet lifetimes that completely evaporate, which
is computed according to the assumptions by Wells [15], i.e.,
based on the d2 -law, at matched RH values. The dotted lines
are the expected droplet lifetime reproduced from Xie et al.
[16] for matched conditions. The blue axes below panels (c)
and (d) show estimated advected distance of small droplets
based on a background advecting velocity of 2 m s−1 .

The second and more crucial factor is the influence
of the humid air around the small droplets, originating
from the humid puff and the ambient surroundings. In
order to quantify this effect on the lifetime, we show the
averaged relative humidity of the droplets throughout
the simulation as function of the initial droplet diameter d in Fig.2c,f. From this figure, we observe a clear
non-monotonic behavior, reflecting two different regimes.
In the first regime for small droplets d = 10 − 100µm,
the relative humidity takes higher values than the ambient, reflecting that the droplets are surrounded by nearly
saturated humid vapor. As the initial droplet size increases, the relative humidity decreases because the settling speed increases and the droplets tend to stray from
the puff (Fig.1b). In the second regime, for large droplets
d > 100 µm, however, we observe that the relative humidity increases with the increase in size. The reason is that
larger droplets evaporate larger quantities of vapor per
given time, which leads to higher relative humidity in
their surroundings. This effect is very local, due to the
strong shear around the falling droplets.
Since the humid puff leads to extended droplet life-

times, it is instructive to examine the propagation of the
humidity field. Indeed, also in the case of dense sprays
[31, 32], the droplets’ fate is determined by the vapor
concentration field. In Fig.3a,b, we show the relative humidity in the puff as function of time and distance from
the respiratory release event, in order to quantify the
propagation of the puff after exhalation. Very soon after the respiratory event starts, moist air coming out of
the mouth creates very high humidity region in the vicinity ≈ 0.3 m of the mouth in 0.2 s. The overall humidity
rapidly decreases after the respiratory event stops, and
the puff continues to propagate because of the conservation of momentum with the puff edge growing proportionally as t1/4 [28], see the solid line in Fig.3, which is an upper bound to our numerical results. Note that this transition to t1/4 is also observed in speech experiments [41].
There, the transition time and distance exhibit shifts
due to small differences in how words are pronounced.
Additional simulations with different mouth shapes and
speeds in Supplemental Material [55] also confirm this
and show the generality of our results.
The extended lifetime of the small droplets can also
be expressed in the so-called evaporation-falling curve,
as introduced in the classical work by William F. Wells
[15]. He derived the dependence of the lifetime of the
droplet on its size, based on the d2 -law for evaporation
of an isolated droplet and on the droplet settling time,
see the dashed curves in Fig.3c,d. According to this classical theory by Wells, droplets below this line evaporate
completely and thus should not exist. In those figures we
now include the histograms of the counts of droplets at
given size and time, based on our DNS at RH of 50% and
90%, respectively. Note that the time (on the x-axis) is
shifted to the expulsion time for each droplet, such that
the history of each droplet begins at time = 0 s. Fig.3c,d
clearly show that a considerable number of small droplets
do exist below the classical Wells curve, demonstrating
that the classical Wells estimate is inappropriate and that

small droplets can live much longer. In fact, Xie et al.
[16] have already addressed the limitations in the study
of Wells, namely by coupling temperature and humidity
fields to a steady-state jet and assuming single droplet.
For comparison, we plot the curves from Xie et al. in
Fig.3c,d. The small droplets from our simulations can
even exceed the Xie et al. estimates. If a background
flow of 2 m/s exists (nominal wind speed at acceptable
comfort levels [66]), these long-lived droplets can easily
travel much farther than 2 m in a second as carried by
the turbulent puff, as shown in the advected distances
estimated in Fig.3c,d.
To study the dependence of different RH, we repeat our
DNS for ambient RH values in the window 50% ≤ RH ≤
90%. From Fig.4a one can observe that the lifetime of the
small droplets increases dramatically and even diverges
to infinity at RH = 100%. The smaller the droplets, the
more pronounced the effect. For the smallest respiratory
droplets of this study with initial diameter d = 10 µm, for
RH = 90% the lifetime extension is with a factor of about
130 as compared to the lifetime of a droplet behaving according to the Wells model, and even with a factor of 166
as compared to the lifetime of Wells model droplet at RH
= 50%. Similarly, for slightly larger droplets with d =
20 µm, the lifetime extension remains significant with a
factor of 80 and 110, respectively. The first reason for the
dramatic increases in droplet lifetime seen in Fig.4a is a
significantly reduced evaporation rate for larger ambient
RH as the ambient gas is much closer to the saturated
condition. The second reason is that for larger ambient
RH the vapour puff can be sustained for longer times
and distances, as shown in Fig.4b. In such case, there is
stronger protection from the vapour puff for larger ambient RH.
In conclusion, our DNS results are consistent with the
multiphase cloud emission model [2], but are inconsistent with Wells’ classical model [15, 17]. The reason is
that Wells’ model assumed that the droplets are isolated,

5
i.e., have no interaction with the near velocity, temperature, and humidity fields around the droplet, which is
far from the case in reality. Indeed, our study has conveyed that in particular the humid vapor exhaled together with the droplets must not be neglected, as the
vapor concentration around the droplet remains high
during the whole respiratory event and thereafter (see
Fig.2a,d), strongly contributing to the lifetime extension
of the small droplets by orders of magnitude. In this
sense the lifetime of the respiratory droplets is mainly
controlled by the mixing [67] of the humidity field exhaled together with them, similarly as occurring for the
lifetime of evaporating dense sprays, which is also controlled by the mixing of the vapor field [31, 32]. The
relevant length scale for droplet evaporation is therefore
not the diameter of the droplet itself (sub-millimeter),
but the outer length scale of the surrounding turbulent
velocity and humidity field, i.e., meters.
The lifetime of respiratory droplets has, to-date,
grossly been underestimated (see Fig.3). The extension
of the droplet lifetime is so extreme that the smallest
droplets (d =10 µm) of our study barely evaporate (lifetime extension by factor 35 at ambient relative humidity RH = 50% and even by factor 166 at RH = 90%)
and are transported in an aerosolised manner. This finding contradicts the ’respiratory droplet’ classification by
WHO for d >5-10 µm droplets [68], which implies that
droplets of these sizes fall ballistically. From our results,
there is strong evidence that even smaller droplets with
initial diameter d ≈ 10 µm will survive even far longer,
because of the protection from the turbulent humid puff.
From Fig.2, one can estimate the correction factor for
the droplet lifetime for given droplet size, as compared
to the Wells estimate. However, in the present study
only the coughing case has been studied. In future work,
more studies for other respiratory events with different
Reynolds numbers and ambient conditions should be conducted to fully parametrize the correction factor. For
example, for sneezing, while the expulsion velocity of
droplets is larger, shorter lifetime of droplets is expected
due to faster dissipation of the vapour puff by stronger
entrainment.
Our results also show that the lifetime extension of the
respiratory droplets is more significant when the ambient
RH is higher, see Fig.4a. The reason lies in the longer
lifetime of the local humidity field around the droplets for
larger ambient RH, consistent with the picture that the
mixing of the local humidity field determines the droplet
lifetime, see Fig.4b. Indeed, L. Bourouiba and coworkers [2, 28–30] have highlighted the qualitative effect of
the vapour puff on the longer airborne transmission of
droplets in their experiment. Here, with the help of Lagrangian statistics, we have quantified this lifetime extension and further elucidated under what conditions and
why it occurs. This finding has important ramifications
on the transport of droplets in case of high RH, which has

implications on the spread of COVID-19. This finding is
also informative for optimizing mitigation strategies such
as controlling indoor humidity and ventilation [69]. Finally, we emphasize that we have only focused on the
flow physics of respiratory droplets, and our conclusion
does not directly infer on the infectivity of virus-laden
droplets or droplet nuclei.
