Abstract
A nonlinear reaction-diffusion system with cross-diffusion describing the COVID-19
outbreak is studied using the Lie symmetry method. A complete Lie symmetry classification is derived and it is shown that the system with correctly-specified parameters admits
highly nontrivial Lie symmetry operators, which do not occur for all known reactiondiffusion systems. The symmetries obtained are also applied for finding exact solutions of
the system in the most interesting case from applicability point of view. It is shown that
the exact solutions derived possess all necessary properties for describing the pandemic
spread under 1D approximation in space and lead to the distributions, which qualitatively
correspond to the measured data of the COVID-19 spread in Ukraine.

Keywords: reaction-diffusion system; cross-diffusion; Lie symmetry; exact solution; modeling pandemic spread.

Introduction

The outbreak of the coronavirus called COVID-19 in China has attracted extensive attention
of many mathematicians working in mathematical modeling. The first papers were already
published in February–April 2020 (see, e.g., [1–7]. At the present time, the COVID-19 outbreak
is already spread over the world as a pandemic. There were 65.5 mln. coronavirus cases and
almost 1.5 mln. deaths caused by this coronavirus up to date December 2 [8].
Nowadays, there are many mathematical models used to describe epidemic processes and
they can be found in any book devoted to mathematical models in biology and medicine (see,
e.g., [9–12] and papers cited therein). The paper [13] is one of the first papers in this direction.
The authors created a model based on three ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which
nowadays is called the SIR model. There are several generalizations of the SIR model and the
SEIR model (see the pioneering works [14,15]), which involves four ODEs, is the most common
among them. These two models are mostly used for numerical simulations in mathematical
modeling the COVID-19 outbreak (see, e.g., [2, 4, 5]).

On the other hand, one may note that the spread of many epidemic processes, including
the COVID-19 pandemic, is often highly non-homogenous in space. This fact can be taken
in different ways but the most common approach consists in dividing the large domain (say
a country) into many small sub-domains (regions of the country) and to apply the standard
models based on ODEs to each sub-domain. However, there is another way – to use the
reaction diffusion equations in order to model the spread of the infected population as a diffusion
process [16, 17] (see also earlier papers cited therein). A possible model was also suggested in
our previous work [18]. The model has the form
ut = d1 ∆u + u(a − buγ ),

(1)

vt = d2 ∆u + k(t)u,

where the lower subscript t means differentiation with respect to (w.r.t.) this variable, ∆ is the
Laplace operator, u = u(t, x, y) and v = v(t, x, y) are two unknown functions, k(t) is the given
smooth positive function, d1 and d2 are diffusivities.
The function u(t, x, y) describes the density (rate) of the infected persons (the number of the
COVID-19 cases) in a vicinity of the point (x, y), while v(t, x, y) means the density of the deaths
from COVID-19. The diffusivity coefficients d1 and d2 describe the random movement of the
infected persons, which lead to increasing the pandemic spread. Formally speaking, one may
take d1 = d2 . However we believe that d1 > d2 because the movement of the infected persons
leads firstly to higher rate of new COVID-19 cases but only some of them cause new deaths.
Each coefficient in the reactions terms, a, b, γ and k(t), has the clear meaning described and
verified in [18] (see Pages 2 and 3 therein).
Of course, this model is an essential simplification because many factors causing the spread
of COVID-19 are not taking into account. In paper [16], for example, the authors construct
the diffusion model, which is essentially based on the SEIR model. As a result, their model
consists of five PDEs, which can be analyzed only using numerical methods. Our idea was to
construct a simpler model, which can be solved using analytical approaches, in particular, the
Lie symmetry method [19–21] and to show its applicability for the spread of the coronavirus
pandemic. It is interesting to note that equations (3) and (5) from the model developed in [16]
under the natural assumptions produce equations with a similar structure to those in (1). In
fact, the density of infected population is proportional to that of the total living population and
is proportional to the exposed population density (generally speaking, the relevant coefficients
are some functions but we keep constants). Having such assumptions, one arrives at the system
(in our notations)
ut = ∇(d1 u∇u) + u(a − bu),

(2)

vt = k(t)u,

The difference between (1) with γ = 1 and (2) consists only in the diffusion terms. In our
model, the diffusivity is taking to be a constant, while one is a linear function in paper [16].
Notably, the diffusivity is a time-dependent function in paper [17].
2

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a complete Lie symmetry
classification (LSC) (group classification) of system (1) is derived. In particular, we have proved
that there are systems with correctly-specified parameters d1 , d2 , a and γ when the system
in question admits highly nontrivial Lie symmetry, which have no analogs for other known
reaction-diffusion systems. The results were obtained using the Lie–Ovsiannikov method [19],
which is a combination of the classical Lie method and the technique for finding equivalence
transformations (ETs). The modern description of this method, its extension and applications
can be found in [20] (Chapter 2).
In Section 3, exact solutions of the specified system of the form (1) are constructed using
its Lie symmetry operators. In particular, the traveling wave type solution is derived and its
applicability is extensively discussed. It is shown that this exact solution describes adequately
the spread of the coronavirus pandemic provided the 1D approximation of space is assumed.
Finally, we discuss the main results of the paper in the last section.

Main Results

In this section, it is identified that the basic system (1) for the pandemic modeling possesses a
very reach Lie symmetry depending on the parameters γ, d1 and d2 and the function k(t). First
of all, we note that for the LSC we need only the restrictions d21 + d22 6= 0 (otherwise the system
in question degenerates into the ODE system, which was solved in [18]), k 6= 0 (otherwise the
system in question seems to be useless for applications) and b 6= 0 and γ 6= 0, −1 (otherwise
the system in question is linear, hence is also integrable).
First of all, we present a statement about the group of ETs of system (1). For this purpose
we apply the technique, which was developed in [22, 23] (see also Section 2.3 in [20]).
Theorem 1 The group of the continues ETs transforming system (1) to that with the same
structure, i.e.,
ut = d1 ∆u + u(a − buγ ),

(3)

v t = d2 ∆u + k(t)u,
is the infinite-parameter Lie group generated by the transformations
t = β1 t + α0 , x = β2 (x cos β0 + y sin β0 ) + α1 , y = β2 (y cos β0 − x sin β0 ) + α2 ,
u = β3 u, v = β4 v + f (x, y),
β2
β2β
k = ββ1 β4 3 k, d1 = β21 d1 , d2 = β21 β34 d2 , a = βa1 , b = β1bβ γ , γ = γ.

(4)

Here αi (i = 0, 1, 2) and βj (j = 0, . . . , 4) are the real group parameters with the restrictions
β1 β2 β4 6= 0, β3 > 0, and f (x, y) is an arbitrary smooth function.
3

Remark 1 In order to obtain system (3) with the nonnegative parameters (this is the biologically motivated requirement explained above), the additional restrictions β1 > 0 and β4 > 0
should take place.
Sketch of Proof of Theorem 1 is based on the known technique for constructing the group
of ETs. It is nothing else but a modification of the classical Lie method. In the case of system
(1), one should start from the infinitesimal operator
E = ξ 0 (t, x, u, v)∂t + ξ 1 (t, x, u, v)∂x + η 1 (t, x, u, v)∂u + η 2 (t, x, u, v)∂v
+ζ(t, x, u, v, k)∂k + µ1 ∂d1 + µ2 ∂d2 + µ3 ∂a + µ4 ∂b + µ5 ∂γ

(5)

being ξ 0 , ξ 1 , η 1 , η 2 and ζ to-be-determined functions, while µi (i = 1, . . . , 5) to-be-determined
constants. The operator E involves the additional terms with the coefficients µi and ζ, because
d1 , d2 , a, b, γ and k(t) should be treated as a new variables.
In order to find the operator E, we should apply Lie’s invariance criteria to the system of
equations consisting of (1) and a set of differential consequences of k(t) w.r.t. the variables
t, x, u, v. Of course, each consequence is equal to zero, excepting ∂k
= k ′ (t) (the latter is
∂t
not useful because it is identity). As a result, we obtain a multicomponent system consisting
∂k
equations from (1) and primitive equations like ∂x
= 0. Applying to this system Lie’s invariance
criteria, i.e., the second prolongation of the infinitesimal operator E, for deriving the system of
determining equations, the coefficients ξ 0 , ξ 1 , η 1 , η 2 , ζ and µi (i = 1, . . . , 5) were found. They
have the form
ξ 0 = C1 t + C2 , ξ 1 = C3 x + C4 y + C5 , ξ 2 = C3 y − C4 x + C6 ,

η 1 = C7 u, η 2 = C8 v + h(x, y), ζ = (C8 − C1 − C7 ) k, µ1 = (2C3 − C1 ) d1 ,

(6)

µ2 = (2C3 − C1 + C8 − C7 ) d2 , µ3 = −C1 a, µ4 = − (C1 + C7 γ) b, µ5 = 0,

where Ci , i = 1, . . . , 8 are arbitrary constants and h(x, y) is an arbitrary smooth function. The
operator (5) with the coefficients (6) generates the Lie group (4).
The sketch of the proof is now completed.
In order to provide a complete LSC of system (1), one should to identify the principal
algebra of invariance (see definition, for example, in [20], page 23) from the very beginning.
In fact, system (1) involves an arbitrary function k and several parameters (some of them can
vanish). Thus, it should be considered as a class of systems of partial differential equations
(PDEs), if one is going to provide a rigorous LSC.
Theorem 2 The principal algebra of invariance of system (1) is infinite-dimensional Lie algebra generated by the operators:
∂x , ∂y , y ∂x − x ∂y , F (x, y) ∂v ,

(7)

where F (x, y) is an arbitrary smooth function.

The proof of this statement can be derived in different two ways. The direct approach
consists in application of the classical Lie method to system (1), assuming that all parameters
are arbitrary. The second way is useful if the group of ETs is known. So, having Theorem 1,
we simply calculate when transformations (4) transform (1) in itself, i.e., system (3) coincides
with (1). The result immediately leads to formulae (7).
Now we present two main theorems, which completely solve the LSC problem for (1). It
turns out that there are two essentially different cases, d1 6= 0 and d1 = 0, leading to absolutely
different results.
Theorem 3 System (1) with d1 6= 0 admits the extension of the principal algebra (7) only in
five cases. These cases and the corresponding Lie symmetry operators are as follows
1) k(t) = 1 : ∂t ;
2) a = 0, k(t) = 1t : 2t ∂t + x ∂x + y ∂y − γ2 (u∂u + v∂v );
3) a = 0, d2 = 0, k(t) = tp , p 6= −1, 0 : 2t∂t + x ∂x + y ∂y − γ2 (u∂u + (1 − γp − γ)v∂v ) ;
4) d2 = 0, k(t) = ept , p 6= 0 : ∂t + pv∂v ;
5) d2 = 0, a = 0, k(t) = 1 : ∂t , 2t∂t + x ∂x + y ∂y − γ2 (u∂u + (1 − γ)v∂v ).
Here p is arbitrary constant.
Any other system (1) with d1 6= 0 admitting an extension of the principal algebra (7) is
reduced by an ET from (4) to one of the listed in cases 1)–5).
Remark 2 Using the simple ET from (4), one can set k0 k(t) (k0 is an arbitrary constant)
instead of k(t) in each case of Theorem 3 without any changes in Lie symmetry operators. It
is useful from the applicability point of view.
Theorem 4 System (1) with d1 = 0 (then automatically d2 6= 0) admits the extension of the
principal algebra (7) only in four cases. In each case the additional operators have the structure
X = ξ 0 (t, u) ∂t + ξ 1 (x, y) ∂x + ξ 2 (x, y) ∂y + η 1 (t, u) ∂u + (G(t, x, y, u) + (ξt0 − 2ξx1 + ηu1 )v) ∂v ,
(8)
where the functions ξ 1, ξ 2 form an arbitrary solution of the famous Cauchy-Riemann system
ξx1 = ξy2 , ξy1 = −ξx2 ,

(9)

and G is an arbitrary solution of the linear first-order PDE

Gt + u(a − buγ )Gu = k(t) η 1 + 2uξx1 − uηu1 + uk ′ (t)ξ 0 + u2 k(t) (a − buγ ) ξu0 .

(10)

In the operator X, the functions ξ 0 and η 1 depending on the parameters γ and a have the
forms :

Here α1 and α2 are arbitrary parameters while the functions f1 , f2 and g are such that the
identity ξt0 = −ηu1 should take place.
Proofs of Theorems 3 and 4 are based on the technique, which is a combination of the
classical Lie method and the group of ETs. This technique is often called the Lie–Ovsiannikov
method because L.V. Ovsyannikov was the first who applied such technique for solving the LSC
problem (group classification problem) for a class of the nonlinear heat equations [19]. Here we
present the proof of Theorems 4 because that is more complicated comparing with the proof of
Theorem 3.
Proof of Theorem 4.
System (1) with d1 = 0, d2 6= 0 can be rewritten as
ut = u(a − buγ ),

(11)

vt = ∆u + k(t)u.

using an appropriate ET from (4). As usually, we start from the most general form of a Lie
symmetry operator
X = ξ 0 (t, x, y, u, v) ∂t + ξ 1 (t, x, y, u, v) ∂x + ξ 2(t, x, y, u, v) ∂y
+η 1 (t, x, y, u, v) ∂u + η 2 (t, x, y, u, v)∂v .

(12)

In order to find all Lie symmetry operators of the form (12) of system (11) one should apply
the following invariance criterion :

where operators X and X are the first and second prolongations of the operator X and the

manifold M is defined by the system of equations
ut = u(a − buγ ), vt = ∆u + k(t)u,
utt = (a − b(γ + 1)uγ ) ut , utx = (a − b(γ + 1)uγ ) ux , uty = (a − b(γ + 1)uγ ) uy .
It should be stressed, that the manifold M involves not only the equations of the system in
question but also the first-order consequences of the first equation of (11). These consequences
guarantee a complete solving the LSC problem. Notably, such peculiarity does not occur for
scalar PDEs but one was noted for some systems of PDEs involving equations of different order
(see, e.g., the relevant discussion in [21] Section 1.2.5).
Having the correctly-defined manifold M, the invariance criterion (13) after rather standard
calculations leads to the system of determining equations as follows
ξx0 = ξy0 = ξv0 = 0, ξt1 = ξu1 = ξv1 = 0, ξt2 = ξu2 = ξv2 = 0,

(14)

ηx1 = ηy1 = ηv1 = 0, ηv2 = ξt0 − 2ξx1 + ηu1 ,

(17)

(19)

Equations (14)–(15) can be easily integrated, hence the general form of the infinitesimal
operator (12) can be specified as (8). Now substituting the function

η 2 = G(t, x, y, u) + ξt0 − 2ξx1 + ηu1 v

into equation (19) and splitting the equation obtained w.r.t. the variable v, we arrive at the
linear equation (10) for G(t, x, y, u) and the equation
0

u (a − buγ ) ξtu

(20)

Obviously, equations (16) coincide with (9).
Thus, we need only to solve the overdetermined system of equations (17), (18) and (20)
w.r.t. the functions ξ 0 and η 1 . This is a nontrivial task because the function ξ 0 depends on the
7

dependent variable u in contrast to the standard situation for the systems of reaction-diffusion
equations (see [24, 25] and the papers cited therein). Since ξu0 6= 0, we used the differential
consequence of equations (17) and (18) w.r.t. the variables t and u. Differentiating equation
(17) w.r.t. t, taking the second-order consequence of equation (18) w.r.t. u and making the
relevant calculations, we were able to derive the simple relation
ξt0 =

(1 − γ) u(a − buγ )ηu1 − u2 (a − buγ )2 ξu0 + (aγ − a + buγ )η 1 = 0.

Thus, the following two cases must be examined separetely : γ 6= 1 and γ = 1.
In the case γ 6= 1, one immediately obtains

(25)

if a = 0. Here f (t) and g(t) are arbitrary smooth functions at the moment. In order to find the
functions f (t) and g(t), one needs to substitute (24) and (25) into equation (18). As a result,
cases 1) and 2) of Theorem 4 were identified.
In the case γ = 1, equations (17), (18) and (21) take the forms

while equation (20) is satisfied identically. Integrating the last two equations of system (26),
we arrive exactly at Cases 3) (for a 6= 0) and 4) (a = 0) of Theorem 4. Notably, we used the
transformations u∗ = a−bu
eat (in the case a 6= 0) and u∗ = u1 − bt (in the case a = 0) for solving
u
the second equation of system (26).
As one can note, the functions ξ 0 and η 1 involve arbitrary functions f1 , f2 and g in cases 3)
and 4) of Theorem 4. However, they should be specified from the equation ξt0 = −ηu1 . At the
final stage, both functions, ξ 0 and η 1 , should be inserted into (10). The equation obtained is
an integrable first-order PDE and its general solution is easily constructed in an explicit form
provided the function k(t) is given. Thus, all the coefficients of operator (8) are identified.
The proof is now complete.
Let us present examples of highly nontrivial Lie symmetries in cases 3) and 4) (see Theorem 4). Setting f1 = 1 into expressions arising in cases 3) and 4) and using the equation
ξt0 = −ηu1 , one can specify ξ 0 and η 1 as follows

take the particular solution ξ 1 = y, ξ 2 = −x of the Cauchy-Riemann system (9) and fix the

Exact solutions and their interpretation

Theorems 3 and 4 allows us to reduce the basic system (1) to that of lower dimensionality.
In fact, using the Lie symmetry operators (or their linear combinations) listed in Theorems 3
and 4 one can reduce (1) to the corresponding (1 + 1)-dimensional system and the latter to an
ODE system. Here we examine only two cases in order to show that those lead to useful exact
solutions.
First of all, one may simplify the nonlinear system (1) using the ETs (4) with the correctlyspecified parameters

Here and in what follows we preserve the old notations for all the variables.
Example 1. Let us apply the operator ∂y from the principal algebra (7) for reduction of the
basic system (29). Obviously, this operator produces the trivial ansatz u = u(t, x), v = v(t, x),
so that we arrive at the system
(30)

This system is nothing else but the initial system under assumption that the distribution
of the infected persons is one-dimensional in space (i.e., the diffusion w.r.t. the axis y is very
small). In this case, the distribution of the total number of deaths will be also one-dimensional.
Making the further plausible assumption d1 ≫ d2 , i.e., the space diffusion of the infected
persons leads mostly to increasing the total number of the COVID-19 cases and not so much
to new deaths, we may put D = 0. Following our previous paper [18], we specify the function
k(t) = k0 e−αt (hereafter k0 > 0, α > 0). Thus, system (30) takes the form
ut = uxx + u (1 − uγ ) ,

Substituting (32) into (31), one arrives at the ODE system
φ′′ + cφ′ + φ (1 − φγ ) = 0,

(33)

cψ ′ + αa ψ = − ka0 φ.

The first equation in (33) is the known second-order ODE, which arises in many applications
(e.g., for study the Fisher equation and its natural generalizations [26]). The general solution
of this ODE can be presented only in parametric form (see, e.g., [27]), which is not useful for
further analysis. However, an exact solution in the explicit form can be constructed for the
correctly-specified parameter c = √ γ+4 . To the best of our knowledge, this parameter and
2(γ+2)

the relevant solution was established in [28] for the first time (see more references in [29]). As
a result, we obtain the traveling front solution of the first equation in system (31):

Notably (34) with A < 0 is still a solution, however, one possesses a singularity. It should be
also noted that the basic system (1) and its particular cases derived above are invariant under
the discrete transformation x → −x, therefore we may put ω = x − √ γ+4 t in what follows.

where g(x) is an arbitrary smooth function. The integral in right hand side of (35) cannot be
expressed in the terms of elementary functions for arbitrary parameters a, α and γ, therefore
we study below a particular case.
In order to avoid cumbersome formulae, let us set γ = 1 in system (31). In this case, the
above exact solution takes the form

Remark 3 The expression for u(t, x) in (36) presents the well-known traveling front of the
famous Fisher equation ut = uxx + u(1 − u), which was firstly identified in [30].
The integral in right hand side of (36) can be expressed in the terms of elementary functions
for several values of the parameter αa . Taking αa = 56 , for example, we obtain

Now we turn to a possible interpretation of solution (37). First of all, the functions u and
v should be nonnegative for any t > 0 and x ∈ I (here I ⊂ R) because they represent the
densities. Obviously, the functions u is always positive. It is easily seen that each function g(x)

which guarantees that the zero density of the deaths in the initial time t = 0, i.e., v(0, x) = 0.
Examining the space interval I = [x1 , x2 ], x1 < x2 , we can calculate the total number of the
COVID-19 cases and deaths on this interval as follows
Rx
U(t) = x12 u(t, x)dx,

V (t) = x12 v(t, x)dx.

Figure 1: Solution (37)-(38) of the nonlinear system (31) with γ = 1. The function u(t, x) (left
surface) describes the density of the of the COVID-19 cases while the function v(t, x) (right
surface) describes the density of deaths. The parameters are: k0 = 0.01, a = 0.3, A = 1.
Moreover, taking the appropriate function g(x), we can guarantee that
U(0) = U0 ≥ 0, V (0) = V0 ≥ 0.
Thus, one may claim that the exact solution (37) possesses all necessary properties for the
description of the distribution of the COVID-19 cases and the deaths from this virus in timespace (under 1D approximation).
Examples of the exact solution (37) with the specified parameters and the corresponding
functions (40) are presented in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. Notably, the parameters a and k0 were taken
approximately the same as in [18]. It follows from Fig. 1 that the spread of the COVID-19
cases in space has the form of a traveling wave and this coincides (at least qualitatively) with
the real situation in many countries. In Ukraine, for example, the COVID-19 pandemic started
in the western part and then spread to the central and eastern parts of Ukraine (the major
exception was only the capital Kyiv, in which the total number of the COVID-19 cases was high
from the very beginning). The distribution of deaths in space has more complicated behavior
(see the right plot in Fig. 1). On the other hand, it is easily seen from Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 that
v(t, x) ≪ u(t, x) what is in agreement with the measured data in many countries [8]. Notably,
the behavior of the function v(t, x) can be essentially changed by the appropriate choice of the
function g(x).
Example 2. Let us apply the operator y∂x − x ∂y from the principal algebra (7) for
reduction of the basic system (29). Obviously, this operator produces the well-known ansatz

same as in Fig. 1.
u = u(t, r), v = v(t, r), r 2 = x2 + y 2, i.e., we examine the radially-symmetric case. In this case,

In contrast to the first equation in (33), the first ODE in the above system is much more

It can be only noted that φ = 1 is the steady-state solution. As a result, we arrive at the

Of course, the restriction α < 0 should take place because the function v means the density. On
the other hand, it means the exponential growing of the function v what is rather unrealistic
because one obtains the total extinction of the population in question for a finite time.

Conclusions

The main part of this paper is devoted to the LSC of the class of reaction-diffusion system
with the cross-diffusion (1). The system in question was suggested in work [18] as the natural
generalization of the mathematical model for describing the COVID-19 outbreak.
Firstly, we present a statement about the group of ETs of system (1) (see Theorem 1) in
order to establish possible relations between systems that admit equivalent invariance algebras.
Secondly, we find the principal algebra of system (1), i.e., the maximal invariance algebra of this
system with arbitrary coefficients (see Theorem 2). And lastly, we present two main theorems
(Theorems 3 and 4) describing reaction-diffusion systems of the form (1) admitting nontrivial
Lie symmetry, i.e., present the LSC of system (1). In Section 3, we demonstrate that the Lie
symmetries identified in Section 2 are useful for finding exact solutions, which can describe the
spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.
From the mathematical point of view, the most interesting Lie symmetry operators of system
(1) occur when d1 = 0 and are presented in Theorem 4. One sees that the coefficient ξ 0 of
the infinitesimal operator X (see(8)) depends on the variable u (excepting case 2). Moreover,
this dependence is nonlinear. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first example of such
dependence for systems of evolution equations, in particular, reaction-diffusion systems. We
assume that such unusual Lie symmetry of system (1) with d1 = 0 can be a consequence of its
integrability. In fact, one may consider the first equation as an ODE with the variables x and
y as parameters. Solving this ODE, one obtains


u(t, x, y) = a e C(x, y) a + b C (x, y) e − 1
,

where C(x, y) is an arbitrary function. Substituting this expression for u into the second
equation of the system, one again obtains the integrable ODE to find the function v.
Finally, it should be pointed out that Lie symmetries operators, which are nonlinear w.r.t.
unknown functions were recently identified for a simplification of the Shigesada–Kawasaki–
Teramoto system in [25] (see Section 3). Such peculiarity of Lie symmetry also occurs for
a special Schrödinger type equation [31], which can be rewritten in the form of a reactiondiffusion system with the cross-diffusion. However, the coefficient ξ 0 (see operator (12)) in
all known Lie symmetries of a wide range of reaction-diffusion systems [25, 31–36] (see more
references in Chapter 2 of [37]) do not depend on the unknown function(s) in contrast to
those in Theorem 4 and examples (27)–(28). Moreover, we may conclude that the well-known
‘people theorem’ stating that the coefficient ξ 0 in each Lie symmetry of an arbitrary scalar
evolution PDE of the order two and higher can depend only the time variable (no dependence on
space variables and/or dependent variable!), cannot be generalized on the systems of evolution
equations without additional restrictions. The problem how to define these restrictions is an
open question.
From the applicability point of view, the most interesting system of the form (1) admitting
nontrivial Lie symmetry is presented in case 4) of Theorem 3. Here the function k(t) of system
(1) has the form that can be useful for describing the COVID-19 outbreak [18]. Moreover, the
diffusivity d2 = 0 as it is stated in [16]. In Section 3, we demonstrate how the Lie symmetries
obtained can be applied for constructing of exact solutions. Furthermore we prove that an
exact solution (with correctly-specified parameters) possesses all necessary properties for the
description of the distribution of the COVID-19 cases and the deaths from this virus in time
and space. Although it was done under 1D space approximation, this solution can be useful
for the prediction of the COVID-19 pandemic if its spread has a favorite direction (a typical
example is Ukraine). Of course, one needs to identify all the parameters in system (1) in order
to calculate correct numbers of the COVID-19 cases and make a plausible prediction but this
lays beyond the scope of this work.
