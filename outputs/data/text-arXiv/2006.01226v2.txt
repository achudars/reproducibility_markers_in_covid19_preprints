Abstract
The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has infected over 10 million people globally
with a relatively high mortality rate. There are many therapeutics undergoing clinical trials, but
there is no effective vaccine or therapy for treatment thus far. After affected by the Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), molecular signaling of host cells play critical
roles during the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2, like RNA replication, assembly. Thus, it is significant
to identify the involved molecular signaling pathways within the host cells, and drugs targeting on
these molecular signaling pathways could be potentially effective for COVID-19 treatment. In this
study, we aimed to identify these potential molecular signaling pathways, and repurpose existing
drugs as potential effective treatment of COVID-19 to facilitate the therapeutic discovery, based
on the transcriptional response of host cells. We first identified dysfunctional signaling pathways
associated with the infection caused SARS-CoV-2 in human lung epithelial cells through analysis
of the altered gene expression profiles. In addition to the signaling pathway analysis, the activated
gene ontologies (GOs) and super gene ontologies were identified. Signaling pathways and GOs
such as MAPK, JNK, STAT, ERK, JAK-STAT, IRF7-NFkB signaling, and MYD88/CXCR6 immune
signaling were particularly identified. Based on the identified signaling pathways and GOs, a set
of potentially effective drugs were repurposed by integrating the drug-target and reverse gene
expression data resources. In addition to many drugs being tested in clinical trials, the
dexamethasone was ranked top 1 in our analysis, which was the first reported drug to be able to
significantly reduce the death rate of COVID-19 patients receiving respiratory support. These
results can be helpful to understand the associated molecular signaling pathways within host
cells, and facilitate the discovery of effective drugs for COVID-19 treatment.

1. Introduction
By June 29, 2020, there were over 2,500,000 confirmed cases (with >120,000 deaths) of
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the U.S. and over 10 million cases (with >500,000
deaths) globally, based on the COVID-19 Dashboard1 operated by the Center for Systems
Science

and

Engineering

(CSSE)

at

Johns

Hopkins

University

(JHU)

(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). The primary organ of infection is considered to be the lung,
and the infection leads to acute hypoxemic respiration and ultimately to multi-organ failure and
death2. The mortality rate of COVID-19 is relatively high3, compared with the flu epidemic. So far,
there is no newly FDA approved drug for the treatment of COVID-19. Recently, remdesivir,
developed by Gilead Sciences, was granted an FDA emergency use authorization for COVID-19
treatment. However, remdesivir can reduce the time of recovery and cannot significantly reduce
the mortality rate4. To improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients, many existing drugs are being
evaluated in clinical trials globally, like chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and
lopinavir–ritonavir, and dexamethasone. Thus, repurposing existing medications is considered an
important approach to speed up the drug discovery for COVID-19. A few days ago,
dexamethasone, an existing FDA approved drug, was reported to be the first drug that can reduce
the death rate, by one-fifth to one-third, of COVID-19 patients receiving respiratory support5, which
was ranked No.1 in our analysis.
Although 1,570 clinical trials have been initiated globally for COVID-19 treatment by June 29,
2020, based on the data from the dashboard6 of real-time clinical trials of COVID-19
(https://www.covid-trials.org/), only one drug, dexamethasone, was reported to be able to
significantly reduce the death rate of COVID-19 patients receiving respiratory support5. One
possible reason is that most of the current clinical trials are based on limited knowledge of the
disease and observed phenotypes. The molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways within
the host cells such as lung cells, which play critical roles in the life cycle of Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, remain unidentified. Thus, it is
significant to uncover the mysterious molecular signaling pathways within host cells via
computational data analysis. It is also important and needed to facilitate drug repurposing and
design of new clinical trials.
In order to understand the transcriptional response of lung cells to the SARS-CoV-2 infection,
Albrecht and tenOever laboratories profiled the RNA-seq gene expression from human NHBE
(Normal Human Bronchial Epithelial) cells, A549 lung cancer cells (no ACE2 expression),
A549_ACE2 (A549 lung cancer cells transduced with a vector expressing human ACE2), and
CALU-3 lung cancer cells (with ACE2 expression), and 2 human lung samples infected by SARS-

CoV-27. The data are valuable sources for identifying genetic pathways that become dysregulated
during active infection. More importantly, the data allows for the identification of activated
signaling pathways that can be targeted by existing pharmaceutical agents. In this study, we
aimed to identify activated signaling pathways within lung host cells affected by SARS-CoV-2 and
repurpose existing drugs for COVID-19 treatment using a novel integrative data analysis
approach, integrating transcriptional response7, signaling pathway8, gene ontology9, drug-target
interactions from drugbank10 and reverse gene signature data from connectivity map (CMAP) 11,12.
These results, including the identified signaling pathways, activated GOs, and drugs, can be
helpful to facilitate the experimental screening and clinical trial design to speed up the therapeutic
discovery for COVID-19.

2. Materials and Methodology
RNA-seq data (gene expression) from NHBE (Normal Human Bronchial Epithelial) cells, A549
(no ACE2 expression) cells, A549_ACE2 cells (A549 lung cancer cells transduced with a vector
expressing human ACE2), and CALU-3 lung cancer cells (with ACE2 expression) cells infected
by SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from GEO (GSE147507)7. This data was generated by Drs.
Albrecht and tenOever’s at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The DEseq213 tool was
used to calculate the fold change and p-value of individual genes in the NHBE (normal tissue),
A549_ACE2, and CALU-3 lung cancer cells respectively before- and after- viral exposure. The
data of A549 cell was not used considering that the ACE2, with which SARS-CoV-2 interacts to
enter host cells, is not expressed in A549 cell.
For the signaling network analysis, the 307 KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes)8 signaling pathways were extracted. To identify the activated signaling network for
NHBE, A549_ACE2 and CALU-3 cells respectively, the signaling paths, i.e., the shortest paths
link source signaling genes (starting genes on the signaling pathways) and the sink signaling
genes (ending genes on the signaling pathways) within the 307 KEGG signaling pathways were
first identified. For each signaling path, the average fold change of genes on the signaling path
was calculated. Then the signaling paths with the average fold change score greater than the
mean score + 1.25 standard deviation threshold were selected to construct the activated signaling
network. To remove the tumor specific signaling pathways, the common signaling pathways
between NHBE and A549_ACE2, and between NHBE and CALU-3 were unified as the potential
activated signaling pathways associated with the viral infection. To identify potential drugs that
can inhibit the signaling genes on the activated signaling pathways, the drug-target interactions

of FDA-approved drugs were downloaded from the DrugBank10 database. Then drugs targeting
the activated signaling pathways were identified as potential effective drug candidates for COVID19 treatment.
For the gene ontology (GO)9 analysis, the Fisher’s exact test, with a threshold p-value = 0.1,
was used to identify the statistically activated GOs based on the up-regulated genes. Since there
are many activated GOs, and some of them are semantically close and sharing the common set
of genes, it was difficult to identify the most important GOs. To solve this challenge, we first
manually removed many of the activated GOs that were not related to biological signaling
processes or general diseases. In addition, we defined the super-GOs, which are defined as subgroups of GOs that have similar or related biological processes. Specifically, after the calculation
of GO-GO similarity using the semantic similarity14 (GOSemSim R package) between activated
GOs, the affinity propagation clustering15 (APclustering) was used to divide the activated GOs
into sub-groups (named super-GOs). Then, the genes that were up-regulated within each superGO were used as signatures to identify potential drugs that can inhibit activation of the superGOs. These gene signatures were fed into the connectivity map (CMAP)11,12 database to identify
potential drugs. A gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)16 was applied on the z-profiles (gene
expression variation before and after treatment with 2,837 drugs and investigational agents) of 9
cells11,12 in the CMAP to identify gene set signature-specific inhibitory drugs. The top ranked FDA
drugs, based on the average GSEA scores, that can potentially inhibit the up-regulated gene
signatures associated with the super-GOs were identified as potential candidates for COVID-19
treatment.

3. Results
3.1 Activated signaling pathways and associated inhibitory medications
The KEGG signaling pathway analysis was conducted to identify the activated signaling pathways
within the lung A549 cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection (see Fig. 1-Upper). As shown, the
IRF7/IFR9, NFkB1, NFkB2, STAT1, TNF, MAPK3K8, MAPK8, and MAPK14 related signaling
pathways are the major activated transcription factors (TFs), which promotes the downstream
activation

of

many

signaling

pathways

including

those

mediated

by

CXCR6/CXCL1/CXCL2/CXCL3/CXCL10, MYD88, CREBBP, JAK1/JAK2, STAT and MAPK
signaling pathways. Also, the WNT4/WNT7A and SMAD signaling pathways are also activated.

Moreover, the PDGFB-EGFR and TUBB1C/2B/3 proliferation signaling pathways are also
activated.
Based on the drug-target interaction data derived from DrugBank, there are 220
drugstargeting 97 genes on the signaling network, with 71 drugs targeting on the PTGS2 gene
specifically (see Table S1). Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were found to inhibit MYD88
immune signaling. Also, acetylsalicylic acid, thalidomide, pranlukast, triflusal, glycyrrhizic acid and
fish oil were found to inhibit NFkB signaling pathway, which was a potential signaling target for
SARS17 treatment, and can also potentially inhibit IRF7 activity. Thalidomide18 inhibiting NFkB
and TNF was reported as potential treatment for COVID-19. Moreover, the tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) found in this study is reported in Lancet19 to be an important therapeutic target for COVID19. Also, JAK1/2 pathways were reported as important targets, and their inhibitors, ruxolitinib,
tofacitinib, baricitinib and fostamatinib, could be effective for COVID-19 treatment. Particularly,
baricitinib, an arthritis drug, could help reduce the out-of-control immune response
(https://www.wired.com/story/ai-uncovers-potential-treatment-covid-19-patients/,

and

https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/eli-lilly-to-study-baricitinib-for-covid-19-treatment/), was
reported in the Lancet20 as a COVID-19 suitable treatment. In addition, the MAPK1, AKT and
PRKCA inhibitors such as isoprenaline, arsenic trioxide, vitamin e, and midostaurin could be also
effective. Moreover, the IL6R inhibitor tocilizumab was reported for COVID-19 treatment21, and
another IL6R inhibitor, sarilumab, is being evaluated in clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
NCT04327388). Lastly, STAT1 and IFANR1 were identified as potential targets for COVID-19
treatment and were reported by another group as well22. These results indicated that the identified
activated signaling pathways might play important roles in the viral life cycle and can be helpful
to identify potential therapeutic targets and drugs.
In addition, drugs that have been tested or are currently being tested in clinical trials globally
were identified from the covid-trials dashboard (URL: https://www.covid-trials.org/ (Data:
table_trials - 2020-05-27 05_38_12.csv, and the updated drugs: table_trials - 2020-06-29
22_20_46.csv. Some drugs cannot be found in the table_trials - 2020-06-29 22_20_46.csv
because drug names were replaced by using category names, e.g., ruxolitinib was replaced by
JAK inhibitor), and compared with the drugs identified from the signaling pathway analysis. Based
on the dashboard of clinical trials for COVID-19 treatment, ~114 FDA approved drugs were
reported from 1,132 clinical trials globally (see Table I). Among the 108 drugs, 31 of them are in
the predicted drugs list. These drugs are: hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, tocilizumab,
sarilumab, canakinumab, ruxolitinib, oxygen, sirolimus, ibuprofen, anakinra, acalabrutinib,
baricitinib, ibrutinib, lenalidomide, tirofiban, acetylsalicylicacid, simvastatin, siltuximab,

bevacizumab, tinzaparin, naproxen, celecoxib, tofacitinib, adalimumab, thalidomide, dalteparin,
nadroparin, minocycline, lithium, indomethacin, and nintedanib. In summary, the predicted
signaling network could be helpful to understand the molecular mechanisms within lung host cells
after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Drugs targets on the signaling targets might be effective (some might
also have harmful effects and cautions). Drug combinations (drug cocktails) targeting on different
targets can be potentially synergistic for COVID-19 treatment.

3.2 Activated Gene Ontologies (GOs)
Based on the fold change and p-value obtained from the DEseq2 analysis of NHBE, A549_ACE2,
and CALU-3 cells before and after the viral infection, the up-regulated genes in each cell were
identified respectively. Specifically, for the NHBE cells, 558 genes had a statistically significant
increase with a fold-change >= 1.25 with a p_value <= 0.05. For the A549_ACE2 cells, 1335 upregulated genes were identified with a fold-change >= 2.0 and with a p_value <= 0.05. For the
CALU-3 cells, 1335 up-regulated genes were identified with a fold-change >= 2.0 and with a
p_value <= 0.05.
Based on the three up-regulated gene sets, the activated GOs with enriched genes in the
three gene sets were identified respectively with a p-value <= 0.05 (obtained from the Fisher’s
exact test) and the number of genes in GOs between 10 and 1000. Then the common activated
GOs between NHBE and A549_ACE2 cells and between NHBE and CALU-3 cells were unified.
After empirically removing the unrelated and general GOs, 73 GOs were kept. Then, the clustering
analysis was employed to divide the activated GOs into 5 sub-groups (named super-GOs).
Among the 73 GOs, 212 up-regulated genes were kept. Fig. 2 shows the network of the 212 upregulated genes, 73 activated GOs and 5 super-GOs. Genes associated with the GOs in each
super-GO are collected as gene set signatures for drug discovery analysis. In addition to the viral
process related signaling, the GO analysis identified many potential viral infection related
signaling pathways, e.g., MAPK, JNK, STAT, ERK1/2, MYD88 and Toll like receptor signaling
pathways. These results are consistent and complement the KEGG signaling pathway analysis.

Figure 2: Network of 212 up-regulated genes (cyan color) in lung NHBE, A549_ACE2 and
CALU-3 cells after SARS-CoV-2. There are 73 activated gene ontologies (GOs; red color), and 5
super-GOs (clusters of GOs; purple color). The node size of genes and GOs is proportional to
the fold change and negative log2 p-values respectively.

3.3 Repurposing drugs inhibiting individual super-GOs
The gene signatures in each of 5 super-GO clusters were used as the query input of the CMAP
database to identify drugs capable of inhibiting the associated genetic pathways. Specifically, 255
drugs appeared in the top 100 drugs in at least one of the 5 super-GOs. There were 26 common
drugs among the total drugs derived from aforementioned signaling network analysis and the
super-GO analysis (see Table II). Sixty-five drugs were selected based on their frequency
(frequency >= 3) appeared in the top 100 drugs of each of the 5 super-GOs (see Fig. 3 and Table
III). In Table III, some frequency values are greater than 5, as some drugs were tested multiple
times in CMAP database. Surprisingly, the dexamethasone (glucocorticoid receptor agonist,

corticosteroid agonist, immunosuppressant) (frequency = 17, ranked as No. 1 in our prediction,
see Table III), an existing FDA approved drug, was recently reported to be the first drug that can
significantly reduce the death rate of COVID-19 patients receiving respiratory support5.
Specifically, the clinical trials results indicated that dexamethasone reduced death rate by onethird in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, and reduced the death rate by one-fifth
in COVID-19 patients receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation5. and
hydrocortisone (corticosteroid agonist, glucocorticoid receptor agonist, immunosuppressant,
interleukin receptor antagonist) (frequency = 9) were reported to be related to COVID-19
treatment23.

We further compared the GO analysis derived drugs with the clinical trials drugs, and 16 drugs
were in both the prediction list and the clinical trial reports. The 16 drugs are: dexamethasone,
lopinavir, chloroquine, leflunomide, doxycycline, sitagliptin, lenalidomide, simvastatin, verapamil,
naproxen, tacrolimus, tofacitinib, pirfenidone, thalidomide, formoterol, and azithromycin. The
lopinavir (HIV protease inhibitor) was also identified from top-ranked drugs against the super-GOs,
which has been used for coronavirus treatment in clinical trials. Moreover, 6 drugs appeared in
the predictions derived from signaling network analysis, GO analysis and clinical trials:
chloroquine, lenalidomide, simvastatin, naproxen, tofacitinib and thalidomide. As seen, many of

the predicted drugs were reported in the clinical trials or literature reports, which indicated that
the prediction analysis could be helpful for repurposing existing drugs as novel and potentially
effective treatments for COVID-19.

4. Discussion and Conclusion
Currently, there is no effective new drugs or vaccine approved for the treatment of COVID-19,
though rapid developments are occurring and being translated into clinical use. As the disease
continues to spread, it is becoming increasingly important to develop a treatment modality in the
most time-efficient manner. One such approach is to use genetic information to inform the
repurposing of available medications. This preliminary and exploratory analysis uses
transcriptional response (gene expression) profiles from human host cells before and after the
infection with the SARS-CoV-2. In the analysis results, some potentially important targets,

signaling pathways, and a set of GOs activated within host cells after viral infection, were identified.
Moreover, a set of drugs registered for COVID-19 treatment globally were also identified in the
analysis. These discoveries can be helpful to facilitate the design of future clinical trials for the
COVID-19 treatment.
This exploratory computational study still has some limitations that can be further improved in
the future work. First, the genetic data are derived from an in vitro analysis and will inevitably have
a gene expression profile different from an in vivo epithelial, which may be further modified on a
person-to-person basis. We will investigate the gene expression profiles from COVID-19 patients
in the future work. Second, the signaling network analysis models could be improved by
integrating the KEGG signaling pathways with the GOs (to include more genes) to uncover the
core signaling networks involved in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 within host cells. In the future
work, we will investigate these challenges. Third, the unbiased list of medications generated and
presented was not filtered by route of administration or clinical applicability. For instance, the
immune dampening chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel was identified, but would likely not be
administered to an infected patient due to concern for augmenting viral replication. Therefore,
further pipelines and additional information are needed to analyze the potential effects of these
medications, and to continue developing this computational approach to medication repurposing.
