Abstract: The estimation of the spatiotemporal characteristics of COVID-19, such as the
infection peak and infection duration, is of great significance for the accurate prevention and
control of the pandemic. However, under-reporting of cases is very common in fields
associated with public health. It is also possible to draw biased inferences if the phenomenon
of under-reporting is not taken into account. Therefore, in this paper, infection data of
healthcare workers in Wuhan and Hubei (excluding Wuhan) were considered as a small
sample, and a novel framework was proposed to explore the impact of under-reporting on
COVID-19 infection peak and duration estimation in Wuhan and Hubei (excluding Wuhan).
The results show that the infection peak estimated by the reported cases in Wuhan may lag the
actual infection peak by 9~10 days, and the infection duration estimated by the reported cases
in Wuhan may be 16 days shorter than the actual infection duration. The infection peak
estimated by the reported cases in Hubei (excluding Wuhan) may lag the actual infection peak
by 1~2 days, and the infection duration estimated by the reported cases in Hubei (excluding
Wuhan) may be 12.1 days shorter than the actual infection duration. Additionally, we
confirmed differences in the spatial distribution of COVID-19 statistical characteristics.
Keywords: COVID-19; spatiotemporal distribution; healthcare worker infection; underreporting cases
1 Introduction
COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan at the end of 2019, and subsequently reported
worldwide. As of January 2021, COVID-19 has been reported in more than 220 countries and
regions. The total number of confirmed cases worldwide exceeded 95 million, and the total
number of deaths worldwide exceeded 2 million (Organization, 2020). On the whole, COVID19 globally remains in the pandemic stage (Altimier & Boyle, 2020). At present, COVID-19 has
become the biggest crisis faced by the world since the second world war (Biscayart et al., 2020).
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the prevention and control of the pandemic have become
the focus of social and academic attention (Fang et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020; Huang et al.,
2020). As COVID-19 is a new infectious disease, the spatiotemporal characteristics of COVID19, such as infection duration and peak, require an accuracy in their estimation for the effective

prevention and control of the pandemic (Epidemiology Working Group for NCIP Epidemic
Response & Prevention, 2020). However, under-reporting of cases is a very common
phenomenon in fields associated with public health (Lachmann, Jagodnik, Giorgi, & Ray, 2020;
Lau et al., 2020; Paixão et al., 2020; Prado, Antunes, Bastos, Peres, & Bozza, 2020; Saberi et al.,
2020; Zhao et al., 2020). In particular, for newly detected infectious diseases such as COVID-19,
under-reporting is more likely to occur due to a lack of understanding of the disease, and the
strict diagnostic criteria (Cabaña, Arratia, Fernández-Fontelo, Moriña, & Puig, 2020). If the
phenomenon of under-reporting is not taken into account, it is more likely to draw biased
inferences from the reported data (Fernández‐Fontelo, Cabaña, Puig, & Moriña, 2016). For
example, the estimated infection peak of reported cases may lag behind the actual infection
peak (Li et al., 2020). Therefore, in this study, we focus on the impact of under-reporting on the
estimation of infection peak and duration of the epidemic.
Exploring the impact of under-reporting on the estimation of spatiotemporal
characteristics is essentially a scientific problem, and an accurate small sample is used to
estimate the statistical characteristics of the population (Lauer et al., 2020; Mace, Minta, Manley,
& Aune, 1994; Smid, McNeish, Miočević, & van de Schoot, 2020). At present, domestic and
foreign scholars assume that the statistical characteristics of COVID-19 obey a certain
distribution, and use a small reported data to estimate the characteristics of COVID-19 (Backer,
Klinkenberg, & Wallinga, 2020; Lauer et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Linton, Kobayashi, Yang,
Hayashi, & Nishiura, 2020). For example, Lauer et al. (2020) assumed that the incubation period
of COVID-19 obeys a lognormal distribution, and estimated the median of incubation period
via a small number of reported cases data. Backer et al. (2020) estimated the mean and
percentiles of COVID-19 based on lognormal distribution, gamma distribution, and Weibull
distribution. Li et al. (2020) found that there is a lag of about 10-14 days between the peak of
reported cases and the peak of internet searches and social media data about COVID-19
outbreak in China. Although the above mentioned studies estimate the statistical characteristics
of COVID-19 using multiple distributions, some discrepancies still remain. First, the statistical
characteristics estimated by specific distribution are greatly influenced by selection of samples
(Backer et al., 2020). Second, the reported case data of small samples still need to be accurate,
which may be difficult due to a deviation between the reported cases and the actual cases. Final,
the statistical characteristics of COVID-19 are mostly estimated from the perspective of time,
and impact of space on these statistical characteristics is largely ignored.
Compared with reported case data, infection data of healthcare workers can be considered
as more accurate reference information for estimating the statistical properties of infected
population. In the early stages of the pandemic, infections in healthcare workers were relatively
easier to be diagnosed and counted (Gao, Sanna, Tsai, & Wen, 2020). Therefore, data of infected
healthcare workers can be used to evaluate the actual statistical characteristics of COVID-19
outbreak, including peak time and duration of the epidemic. Considering this, a novel
framework was proposed to evaluate the statistical properties of COVID-19 outbreak in terms
of infection peak and duration of the epidemic based on the infection data of healthcare
workers. The main contributions of this article are as follows:
(1) Different than many other studies on estimating COVID-19 outbreak based on reported
cases, we use the infected health workers to estimate infection peak and duration of the
epidemic, which should be more accurate and reliable for estimation.

(2) A novel framework was proposed, which used a weighted method to integrate the
estimation results of multiple distributions from the temporal perspective.
(3) We’ll apply spatial technology and methodology to analyze possible impact of spatial
structure on COVID-19 outbreak.
2 Study Area and Data Sources

2.1 Study Area
Hubei Province and Wuhan City were the first provinces and cities in China in which
COVID-19 was discovered. As of October 2020, the total number of confirmed cases in Hubei
Province had reached 68,135, accounting for approximately 81.5% of the total cases in the
population, and the total number of confirmed cases in Wuhan had reached 50,340, accounting
for approximately 60.80% of the total cases. In order to explore the impact of under-reporting
cases on the statistical characteristics estimation of COVID-19, the study area was divided into
two parts: Wuhan City and Hubei Province (excluding Wuhan). Hubei Province is located in
the central part of China, and Wuhan City is located in the central part of Hubei Province, as
shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Sketch map of the study area.

2.2 Data Sources and Data Preprocessing

2.2.1 Data Sources
The data used in this paper included the confirmed cases at the city and county level in
Hubei Province and Wuhan, respectively, and information on the healthcare workers in China
obtained via retrospective analyses.
The reported cases in Hubei Province were mainly obtained from the Health Commission
of Hubei Province (http://www.nhc.gov.cn), and spanned the period from January 15, 2020 to
March 31, 2020. The reported cases in Wuhan were mainly obtained from the Wuhan Municipal
Health Commission (http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn), and spanned the period from February 23,
2020 to March 31, 2020.
Data on the confirmed COVID-19 cases of healthcare workers were mainly obtained via
retrospective analyses from the Chinese Red Cross Foundation (https://www.crcf.org.cn/),

which distributes relief funds to every healthcare worker suffering from COVID-19. As of
September 11, 2020, 83 batches of healthcare workers had received foundation assistance. We
used crawler technology to obtain 3,743 publications that elucidated the conditions of
healthcare workers that suffered from COVID-19. After matching their addresses, information
regarding the province, city, and county of all the affected healthcare workers were obtained.
The data format is shown in Table 1.

2.2.2 Data Preprocessing
Data on the reported cases were collected and processed at the China Data Center and
shared on the dataverse platform of Harvard University, which does not require additional
data preprocessing (Hu et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020). Therefore, we mainly conducted data
preprocessing for information on healthcare workers suffering from COVID-19, which was
obtained via retrospective analyses.
The information on healthcare workers obtained via retrospective analyses is mainly
reported to the Chinese Red Cross Foundation in two ways (Foundation, 2020): (1) confirmed
information on healthcare workers is directly reported by individuals to the Chinese Red Cross
Foundation; and (2) confirmed information on healthcare workers is collected by their
respective hospitals, which then report to the Chinese Red Cross Foundation. After
examination and approval by the Chinese Red Cross Foundation, the relevant information is
published on the website after which the hospital may review it. Those who fail to pass the
review do not qualify to be aided. Therefore, data records of unqualified persons should be
deleted from the original data. Moreover, the Chinese Red Cross Foundation not only aided
infected healthcare workers, but also aided infected or diseased staff during the epidemic; Thus
such data records were needed to be deleted. As shown in Figure 2a, after data preprocessing,
a total of 3,703 confirmed cases of healthcare workers remained, including 3,655 from Hubei
Province and 3,058 from Wuhan City. Compared with the real-time data on the confirmed
COVID-19 cases of healthcare workers in the same period (Figure 2b) (Epidemiology Working
Group for NCIP Epidemic Response & Prevention, 2020; Gao et al., 2020), the corresponding
data obtained via retrospective analyses exhibit an obvious quantitative advantage.

number of confirmed cases

3 Methodology
In this study, based on the infection data of the healthcare workers, a novel framework
was used to explore the impact of under-reporting on the infection duration and infection peak
estimation. The overall framework is shown in Figure 3. The framework is divided into four
phases: construction of infection inventory, preliminary exploration of impact results, fitting of
statistical models, and weighted fusion of estimation results. First, due to the existence of the
incubation period, infection inventories were constructed for the healthcare workers and
reported cases in Hubei and Wuhan. Second, based on these inventories, the Pearson
correlation coefficient was used to preliminarily explore the impact of under-reporting on the
estimation of statistical characteristics. Then, three statistical models were fitted with two
samples of healthcare worker cases and reported cases to describe the distribution of epidemic.
Final, the estimation results of multiple distributions were integrated by weighting to
characterize the impact of under-reporting on COVID-19 statistical characteristics estimation.

Figure 3. Research framework for the impact of under-reporting cases on the estimation of infection
peak and infection duration of COVID-19

3.1 Construction of Infection Inventory
Due to the incubation time of the SARS-COV-2 infection, the confirmed time does not

represent the infection time of the healthcare workers and reported cases. Therefore, this study
constructed a Healthcare Worker Infection Inventory and a Reported Infection Inventory based on
partition statistics from two perspectives: Hubei and Wuhan.
The construction of the Infection Inventory can be divided into two steps: (1) Generate a
Confirmed Inventory based on confirmed healthcare worker data, and (2) Generate an Infection
Inventory based on the Confirmed Inventory. The data structures for the two inventories are
shown in Figure 4. Inventory(S, T) represents a spatiotemporal dataset, where S and T are the
spatial and temporal dimension, respectively; 𝑆 = {𝑠 , 𝑠 ,· · ·, 𝑠 }, 𝑇 = {𝑡 , 𝑡 ,· · ·, 𝑡 }, m is the
total number of spatial objects and n is the total number of timestamps.

Figure 4. Data structure of the confirmed and infection inventories.

Considering the healthcare workers in Wuhan as an example, to construct the Healthcare
Worker Infection Inventory in Wuhan, the Confirmed Healthcare Worker Inventory in Wuhan City
was first generated. For example, the calculation method for the number of confirmed
healthcare worker on day 𝑡 in Hongshan, Wuhan City, is shown in Equation (1):
(𝐻𝑜𝑛𝑔𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑛, 𝑡 ) =

𝐻_𝐶_𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑦

|𝑐𝑚𝑠 . 𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑦 == 𝐻𝑜𝑛𝑔𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑛 ∧ 𝑐𝑚𝑠 . 𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑒 == 𝑡 |

,

(1)

𝑐𝑚𝑠 ∈ 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑙𝑡ℎ𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑘𝑒𝑟 𝐼𝑛𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑆𝑒𝑡

where 𝑁 represents the total number of confirmed healthcare worker infections in China,
𝑐𝑚𝑠 represents the information of a specific healthcare worker suffering from COVID-19,
and 𝐻_𝐶_𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑦

represents the Confirmed Healthcare Worker Inventory in Wuhan,

which elucidates the changes in confirmed healthcare worker infections in every county of
Wuhan over time.
To calculate the Healthcare Worker Infection Inventory, we assumed that the incubation time
𝑋 of SARS-Cov-2 is subject to a lognormal distribution, as seen in other acute respiratory viral
infections (Justin et al., 2009). Lauer et al. (2020) found that the mean and standard deviation
of the random variable 𝑙𝑛(𝑋) were 1.621 and 0.418, respectively, i.e., 𝑙𝑛(𝑋)~𝑁(1.621,0.418 ).
Based on the probability distribution function of the incubation time 𝑋, the daily infected
number of healthcare workers can be calculated. For example, the calculation method for the
infected number of healthcare workers on day 𝑡
Equation (2):

in Hongshan, Wuhan City, is shown in

where 𝑝 represents the probability that the incubation time is 𝑖 days; 𝑛 represents the
maximum incubation time (as the incubation time of 98.7% patients is within 13 days, 𝑛 is set
as 13); 𝑢 represents the mean of lognormal distribution, i.e. 1.621; 𝜎 represents the standard
deviation of lognormal distribution, i.e. 0.418; and 𝐻_𝐼_𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑦

represents the

Healthcare Worker Infection Inventory in Wuhan. Similarly, the Reported Infection Inventory in
Wuhan can be expressed as 𝑅_𝐼_𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑦

, and the corresponding Healthcare Worker

Infection Inventory and Reported Infection Inventory in Hubei can be expressed as
𝐻_𝐼_𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑦

and 𝑅_𝐼_𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑦

, respectively.

3.2 Pearson Correlation Coefficient
The 𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑦(𝑆, 𝑇) is essentially a collection of time-series data which records the
spatial characteristics of healthcare infection and reported infection. Therefore, the Pearson’s
correlation coefficient (Benesty, Chen, Huang, & Cohen, 2009) can be used to preliminarily
explore the impact of under-reporting on the statistical characteristics estimation of COVID-19.
If the two series showed a significant positive correlation, the under-reporting of cases had less
impact on the statistical characteristics estimation of COVID-19, and vice versa.
As the 𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑦(𝑆, 𝑇) contains both temporal and spatial dimensions, the correlation
coefficient can be calculated from two perspectives of time and space. As shown in Figure 5,
the spatial correlation was obtained by ℎ_𝑖_𝑡 and 𝑟_𝑖_𝑡 , and the temporal correlation was
obtained by ℎ_𝑖_𝑠 and ℎ_𝑖_𝑠 . The temporal and spatial correlation coefficients of the two
series were calculated using Equations (3) and (4), respectively:
𝐶𝑜𝑣(ℎ_𝑖_𝑠 , 𝑟_𝑖_𝑠 )
𝑟
=
𝐷(ℎ_𝑖_𝑠 ) 𝐷(𝑟_𝑖_𝑠 )
𝐶𝑜𝑣(ℎ_𝑖_𝑡 , 𝑟_𝑖_𝑡 )
𝑟
=
𝐷(ℎ_𝑖_𝑡 ) 𝐷(𝑟_𝑖_𝑡 )

(3)
(4)

where 𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑋, 𝑌) represents the covariance of the series 𝑋 and 𝑌, 𝐷(𝑋) represents the
variance of the series 𝑋, and

𝐷(𝑋) represents the standard deviation of the series 𝑋. The

value range of the correlation coefficient is [-1,1]. When the correlation coefficient is greater
than 0, the time series 𝑋 and 𝑌 are positively correlated; if it is equal to 1, the time series 𝑋
and 𝑌 are completely positively correlated; if it is less than 0, the time series 𝑋 and 𝑌 would
show a negative correlation; and finally, if it is equal to -1, the time series 𝑋 and 𝑌 would
show a complete negative correlation.

3.3 Statistical Models
Statistical models are used to quantitatively analyze the impact of under-reporting on the
statistical characteristics estimation of COVID-19. In this study, we focus on the impact on the
estimation of infection duration and infection peak. Studies have shown that counts of the less
frequent infections typically follow Poisson distribution, whereas those of more frequent
infections may follow approximately normal distribution (Farrington, Andrews, Beale, &
Catchpole, 1996; Unkel, Farrington, Garthwaite, Robertson, & Andrews, 2012). In the early
stages of the epidemic, SARS-Cov-2 infections were frequent. Therefore, two samples of
healthcare worker cases and reported cases were used to estimate the infection peak time and
the infection time duration of the epidemic from three approximately normal distributions:
normal, lognormal, and gamma. The probability density function of normal, lognormal, and
gamma are shown in Equations (5), (6), and (7), respectively:

where 𝑢 and 𝜎 represent the hyper parameters of normal, 𝑢 and 𝜎 represent the hyper
parameters of lognormal, 𝛼 and 𝛽 represent the hyper parameters of gamma, and Γ(𝛼)
represents the gamma function. In this study, the maximum likelihood estimation was used to
fit the hyper parameters of the three distributions, the mean square error (MSE) is used to
evaluate the fitting effect of each distribution.
3.4 Estimation of the Difference in Infection Duration
The difference in the infection duration under a specific distribution indicates that the
impact of under-reporting on the infection duration estimation of COVID-19 under a specific
distribution. The cumulative distribution functions of normal, lognormal, and gamma are used
to infection duration estimate. For example, the calculation method of infection duration in a
specific distribution is shown in Equations (8):

𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑙 = [ 𝑥 , 𝑥 ]
⎧
⎪ 𝑥 = 𝐹 (0.025)
𝑥 = 𝐹 (0.975)
⎨
𝑥
⎪𝐹(𝑥) =

(8)

where 𝑓(𝑥) represents the probability density function; 𝐹(𝑥) represents the cumulative
distribution function; 𝐹

(𝑥) represents the inverse function of 𝐹(𝑥); 𝑥 represents lower

bound of duration; 𝑥 represents upper bound of duration. That is, the infection duration
represents the time span of an epidemic infection in 95% of patients. In order to further
distinguish the infection duration estimated by different data, 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑙
infection duration estimated from the reported cases, and 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑙

represents the

duration estimated from the healthcare worker cases. 𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓 represents the difference of
infection duration in a specific distribution, i.e., 𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓 = 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑙 − 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑙 .
As the difference of infection duration in different distributions is different, we integrated
the estimation results in different distributions by weighting. The integration method is shown
in Equation (9):

3.5 Estimation of the Difference in Infection Peak
The cross-correlation function (Derrick & Thomas, 2004) is used to quantitatively measure
the impact of under-reporting on the infection peak estimation of COVID-19 in different
distributions. As shown in Figure 6, the cross-correlation function can be understood as a
correlation coefficient with a lag. As the cross-correlation function can also be calculated from
two dimensions, we explored the impact of under-reporting on the infection peak estimation
from two perspectives of time and space.

Figure 6. Temporal and spatial lag

(𝜑) is the temporal correlation coefficient between series ℎ_𝑖_𝑠 and 𝑟_𝑖_𝑠 at

lag 𝜑. The lag value that maximizes the 𝑓

(𝜑) is considered as the degree of impact on

infection peak estimation in the temporal dimension. The formal definition can be seen in
Equation (11):
𝜑
where 𝜑

(𝜑) ,

(11)

represents the estimated delay days in temporal dimension. As the delay

days in different distributions is different, we integrated the estimation results in different
distributions by weighting. The integration method is shown in Equation (12):

represents the weighted impact of under-reporting on infection peak

, and 𝑤

carry the same

meanings as in Equation (9)
In addition, we further analyze the impact the impact of under-reporting on the infection
peak estimation of COVID-19 from the spatial dimension. With regard to the spatial dimension,
each time node has a cross-correlation function. For example, the cross-correlation function of
series ℎ_𝑖_𝑡 and 𝑟_𝑖_𝑡 was calculated using Equation (13), as follows:
𝐶𝑜𝑣(ℎ_𝑖_𝑡 , 𝑟_𝑖_𝑡 )
(𝑖, 𝜑) =
𝑓
𝐷(ℎ_𝑖_𝑡 ) 𝐷(𝑟_𝑖_𝑡 )
where 𝑓

(𝑖, 𝜑) is the spatial correlation coefficient between series ℎ_𝑖_𝑡

(13)
and 𝑟_𝑖_𝑡 on

time node 𝑖 at lag 𝜑. In the spatial dimension, the cross-correlation function is a sequence in
specific lag days. Therefore, we integrate the results on different time nodes at specific lag. The
integration method is shown in Equation (14):
𝑓
where

𝑓

(𝜑)

(𝜑) =

𝑤 ∗𝑓

(𝑖, 𝜑)

represents the weighted cross-correlation function in the spatial

dimension. 𝑤 represents the weight of different time nodes. For simplicity, in the spatial

dimension, the weights of different time nodes are the same, i.e., 𝑤 = 𝑤 = 𝑤 = ⋯. Similarly,
the lag value that maximizes the 𝑓

(𝜑) is considered as the degree of impact on infection

peak estimation in the spatial dimension. The formal definition can be seen in Equation (15):
𝜑
where 𝜑

= 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑓

represents the weighted impact of under-reporting on infection peak

estimation in the spatial dimension.
4 Experimental Results and Discussions

4.1 Preliminary Exploration
To analyze the impact of under-reporting cases on the statistical characteristics estimation
of COVID-19, in this section, Pearson correlation coefficient was first used to make a
preliminary exploration from two perspectives of space and time.
4.1.1 Temporal Dimension
Figure 7 shows the temporal correlation between the confirmed healthcare worker cases
and the reported cases in Wuhan. It can be seen from Figures 7a that the estimated infection
peak of the reported cases lagged the infection peak of the healthcare worker cases, and the
estimated infection duration of the reported cases was smaller than that of the healthcare
worker cases. From the perspective of temporal correlation, the temporal correlation coefficient
between the data on daily reported cases and new healthcare worker cases in Wuhan was 0.336,
and the correlation coefficient between the cumulative reported cases and the cumulative
healthcare worker cases in Wuhan was 0.926. This indicated that the phenomenon of underreporting had a greater impact on daily reported cases in Wuhan, and the phenomenon of
under-reporting had little impact on cumulative reported cases in Wuhan.

Figure 7. Temporal correlations between cases of infection in healthcare workers and the reported cases
in Wuhan. (a) Number of infected healthcare workers and reported cases in Wuhan, based on daily new
cases; (b) temporal correlation coefficient in Wuhan, based on daily new cases; (c) Number of infected
healthcare workers and reported cases in Wuhan, based on cumulative cases; and (d) temporal correlation
coefficient in Wuhan, based on cumulative cases.

Figure 8 shows the temporal correlation between the healthcare worker cases and the
reported cases in Hubei (excluding Wuhan). Compared with the temporal correlation
coefficient in Wuhan, the impact of underreporting on COVID-19 infection peak and infection
duration estimation was relatively small in Hubei (excluding Wuhan). From the perspective of
temporal correlation, the temporal correlation coefficient in Hubei (excluding Wuhan) was
significantly higher than that of Wuhan. For example, the correlation coefficient between the
daily reported cases and new healthcare worker cases in Hubei (excluding Wuhan) was 0.828,
and the correlation coefficient between the cumulative reported cases and the cumulative
healthcare worker cases in in Hubei (excluding Wuhan) was 0.988. This indicated that
compared with Wuhan, the impact of under-reporting cases on Hubei (excluding Wuhan) was
relatively small. In addition, in Hubei (excluding Wuhan), the impact of under-reporting on
daily new cases was also greater than that of cumulative cases.

Hubei (excluding Wuhan). (a) Number of infected healthcare workers and reported cases in Hubei

Wuhan), based on daily new cases; (c) Number of infected healthcare workers and reported cases in Hubei
(excluding Wuhan), based on cumulative cases; and (d) temporal correlation coefficient in Hubei
(excluding Wuhan), based on cumulative cases.

4.1.2 Spatial Dimension
As the spread of the epidemic is a dynamic process in space, we first preliminarily
explored the spatial correlation of a single time node, and then explored the spatial correlation

of multiple time nodes.
Figure 9 shows the spatial correlation of the healthcare worker cases and reported cases in
Wuhan on March 6. According to Figures 7a and 7b, except for the Jiangxia District, the spatial
distribution of healthcare worker cases and reported cases in Wuhan was similar. From the
perspective of spatial correlation, the spatial correlation coefficient between the newly reported
cases and the healthcare worker cases was 0.544 in Wuhan on March 6, whereas that between
the cumulative reported cases and the healthcare worker cases was 0.889. These results show
that there was a certain deviation between the newly reported cases and healthcare worker
cases in Wuhan on March 6; however, there was a high correlation between the cumulative
reported cases and healthcare worker cases. This indicated that the findings in the spatial
dimension are similar to those in the temporal dimension, namely, the impact of underreporting on daily new cases was greater than that of cumulative cases.

Wuhan. (a) Reported cases in Wuhan on March 6, 2020; (b) healthcare worker cases in Wuhan on March
6, 2020; (c) spatial correlation coefficient in Wuhan on March 6, 2020, based on daily new cases; and (d)
spatial correlation coefficient in Wuhan on March 6, 2020, based on cumulative cases

Figure 10 shows the spatial correlation of healthcare worker and reported cases in Hubei
(excluding Wuhan) on February 6. Compared with Wuhan, the spatial correlation of healthcare
worker cases and reported cases in Hubei (excluding Wuhan) was significantly improved. For
example, the spatial correlation coefficient between the newly reported cases and healthcare
worker cases was 0.816 in Hubei (excluding Wuhan) on February 6, whereas that between the
cumulative reported and healthcare worker cases was 0.846. The results showed that the
cumulative reported cases and daily new cases are highly correlated with the healthcare
worker infection situation in Hubei (excluding Wuhan).

correlation coefficient in Hubei (excluding Wuhan) on February 6, 2020, based on daily new cases; and (d)
spatial correlation coefficient in Hubei (excluding Wuhan) on February 6, 2020, based on cumulative cases

As Figures 9 and 10 only analyzed the spatial correlation between the healthcare worker
and reported cases at a single time node in Wuhan and Hubei (excluding Wuhan), we further
demonstrated the spatial correlation changes over time in both locations, and the results are
shown in Figure 11.
The results show that the spatial correlation coefficient of daily new cases in Wuhan and
Hubei (excluding Wuhan) have a certain volatility, which may be caused by the spatial
heterogeneity of temporal lag. Secondly, the spatial correlation of new cases in Hubei
(excluding Wuhan) dropped sharply from February 11 to February 29; this is because the
relevant department made some corrections to the reported cases data, which led to the decline
in the spatial correlation in a short period of time. Therefore, after February 29, the spatial
correlation of new cases in Hubei (excluding Wuhan) had rapidly increased and exceeded the
correlation coefficient in the early stage of the epidemic. In addition, the spatial correlation
coefficients of the cumulative cases in Wuhan and Hubei (excluding Wuhan) were high. This
indicated that the phenomenon of under-reporting had little impact on cumulative reported
cases at different time nodes.
Overall, both in spatial dimension and temporal dimension, the phenomenon of underreporting had a greater impact on daily reported cases, among which, the impact of the underreporting phenomenon during the early stages of the pandemic was greater than that during
its later stages. In addition, as the estimation of statistical characteristics was based on daily
new cases, the estimation of statistical characteristics was greatly affected by the underreporting. That is, the estimation of infection peak based on daily reported cases may lag
behind the actual infection peak, and the estimation of infection duration based on daily
reported cases may be smaller than the actual infection duration.

Wuhan), based on cumulative cases

4.2 Fitting of Statistical Models
After preliminary exploration, the phenomenon of under-reporting was found to have a
great impact on daily reported cases. To further quantify impact, in this section, the two
samples of healthcare worker cases and the reported cases were used to fit the statistical
distribution of COVID-19 from the three distributions, so as to lay the foundation for the next
step of infection duration and infection peak estimation.
Figure 12 shows the fitting results of normal, lognormal, and gamma distributions for
healthcare worker cases and reported cases in Wuhan. The results showed that the MSE of the
normal fitting of the reported cases and the healthcare worker cases was 5.50e-05 and 2.34e-05,
respectively; that of the gamma fitting of the reported cases and the healthcare worker cases
was 5.55e-05 and 3.46e-06, respectively; and that of the lognormal fitting of the reported cases
and the healthcare worker cases was 5.52e-05 and 2.04e-06, respectively. In addition, Table 2
shows the statistical characteristics of healthcare worker cases and reported cases in Wuhan,
for which 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) have been calculated via bootstrap resampling
(Efron, 1979). The median and standard deviation of the distributions can approximately
represent the infection peak and infection duration of COVID-19. According to the normal
distribution, the median in Wuhan was estimated to be on February 3 from the data on daily
reported cases, while it was estimated to be on January 25 from the data on cases of infection
in healthcare workers, which is a difference of 9 days. The standard deviation in Wuhan was
estimated to be 12.1 days from the data on daily reported cases, while it was estimated to be

7.6 days from the data on healthcare worker infection cases, i.e., with a difference of 4.5 days.
This also indicated that the estimation of infection peak based on daily reported cases may lag
behind the actual infection peak, and the estimation of infection duration based on daily
reported cases may be smaller than the actual infection duration. Similarly, based on lognormal
distribution and gamma distribution, the infection peak and infection duration estimated from
reported cases had different degrees of lag and shortening.

Figure 13 shows the fitting results of normal, lognormal, and gamma distribution for
healthcare worker cases and reported cases in Hubei (excluding Wuhan), and Tables 3 show
the statistical characteristics of healthcare worker cases and reported cases in Hubei (excluding
Wuhan). Compared with Wuhan, the impact of under-reporting cases on the statistical
characteristics of COVID-19 in Hubei (excluding Wuhan) was relatively small. For example,
the median estimated by the reported cases was delayed by one day based on the lognormal
distribution, while the median estimated by the reported cases did not lag based on the normal
and gamma distribution. The standard deviation estimated by the reported cases was
shortened by 2.8 days based on the lognormal distribution, and the standard deviation
estimated by the reported cases was shortened by 3.4-3.5 days based on the normal and gamma
distribution.

4.3 Impact of Under-reporting on Infection Duration Estimation
In this section, we quantitatively explored impact of under-reporting on infection duration
estimation. Table 4 showed estimated results of percentiles and infection durations from
healthcare worker cases and reported cases in Wuhan. Based on the normal distribution, it was
estimated from reported cases that 95% of patients were infected within 47.5 days, while it is
estimated from healthcare worker cases that 95% of patients are infected within 30.1 days, with
a difference of 17.4 days. Similarly, based on lognormal distribution and gamma distribution,
there was a difference of 15.0-15.6 days between the infection duration estimated by the
reported case and the infection duration estimated by the healthcare worker cases. The results
showed that the statistical characteristics estimated by specific distribution have certain
volatility. As we did not know the true distribution of COVID-19, there may be a large
deviation in judging the impact of under-reporting on the infection duration estimate from the
specific distribution. Therefore, we integrated the estimation results of different distributions
by weighting. Table 5 shows the weighted results of infection durations in Wuhan. The results
showed that the infection duration estimated by the reported cases in Wuhan may be 16 days
shorter than the actual infection duration.

Table 6 shows estimated results of percentiles and infection durations from healthcare
worker cases and reported cases in Hubei (excluding Wuhan). Compared with Wuhan, the
impact of under-reporting on the infection duration estimation of COVID-19 in Hubei
(excluding Wuhan) was relatively small. In Hubei (excluding Wuhan), there was a difference
of 10.9-12.6 days between the infection duration estimated by the reported cases and the
infection duration estimated by the healthcare worker cases. Table 7 shows the weighted results
of infection durations in Hubei (excluding Wuhan). The results showed that the infection
duration estimated by the reported cases in Hubei (excluding Wuhan) may be 12.1 days shorter
than the actual infection duration.
In general, the infection duration estimated from the reported cases was shorter than the
actual infection duration. Among them, the impact of under-reporting on Wuhan was greater
than that on Hubei (excluding Wuhan). That is, the infection duration estimated by the
reported cases in Wuhan may be 16 days shorter than the actual infection duration, and the
infection duration estimated by the reported cases in Hubei (excluding Wuhan) may be 12.1
days shorter than the actual infection duration.

4.4 Impact of Under-reporting on Infection Peak Estimation
In this section, we quantitatively explored impact of under-reporting on infection peak
estimation. First, a cross-correlation function was introduced to describe the infection peak
differences in a specific distribution. Then, the results of multiple estimates were integrated by
weighing from both temporal and spatial perspectives.
4.3.1 Temporal Dimension
Figure 14 shows the cross-correlation results for the healthcare worker infection cases and
reported cases in the time dimension in Wuhan and Hubei (excluding Wuhan). With the
increase in 𝜑 , the cross-correlation function shows a trend of first increasing and then
decreasing, thereby revealing that there was a certain temporal lag in the infection peak
estimated by the reported cases in Wuhan and Hubei (excluding Wuhan). For example, the
infection peak estimated by the reported cases in Wuhan lagged the actual peak by 8 days
based on the normal distribution, and the infection peak estimated by the reported cases in
Wuhan lagged by 11 days based on the lognormal and gamma distributions. Similarly, the
infection peak estimated by the reported cases in Hubei (excluding Wuhan) lagged by 2 days
based on the lognormal and gamma distributions, and the infection peak estimated by the
reported cases in Hubei (excluding Wuhan) did not lag based on the normal distribution.
Tables 8 and 9 show the weighted results of multiple distributions in the temporal dimension.
The results show that the infection peak estimated by the reported cases in Wuhan lagged by
10 days, and the infection peak estimated by the reported cases in Hubei (excluding Wuhan)
lagged by 1.4 days.

4.3.2 Spatial Dimension
Figure 15 shows the cross-correlation results in the spatial dimension for the healthcare
worker cases and the reported cases in Wuhan and Hubei (excluding Wuhan). From the
perspective of space, the curve for Wuhan is more volatile, while the curve for Hubei is less
volatile, which indicates that the impact of under-reporting on Wuhan was also greater than
that on Hubei (excluding Wuhan). As the cross-correlation results in the spatial dimension is a
sequence, it is difficult to intuitively determine the number of lag days caused by the under-

reporting. To further analyze the temporal lag phenomenon quantitatively in the spatial
dimension, Table 10 shows the weighted results of spatial dimension in specific lag days. In
Wuhan, with the increase in φ, the weighted results of spatial dimension showed a trend of
first increasing and then decreasing. When φ=9 days, the weighted results of Wuhan reached
their maximum value, which indicates that the infection peak estimated by the reported cases
in Wuhan lagged the actual peak by 9 days. In Hubei (excluding Wuhan), due to the inaccuracy
of the reported cases from mid-February to February 29 (discussed in section 4.1.2), we have
deleted the data in this duration. The results show that the weighted results based on daily
reported cases in Hubei (excluding Wuhan) changed by a small amount with the increase in φ.
When φ=1 day, the weighted results of Hubei (excluding Wuhan) reached their local maximum
value, which indicates that the infection peak estimated by the reported cases in Hubei
(excluding Wuhan) may lag by one day.
Overall, the impact of under-reporting of cases on infection peak estimation in the spatial
dimension was consistent with the impact on infection peak estimation in the temporal
dimension. First, the impact of under-reporting on the early stages of the pandemic was greater
than that on its later stages. Second, the infection peak estimated by reported cases in Wuhan
lagged by 9~10 days, and the infection peak estimated by reported cases in Hubei (excluding
Wuhan) lagged by 1~2 days.

dimension: (a) temporal lag in Wuhan and (b) Hubei (excluding Wuhan).

4.5 Spatial Difference of Statistical Characteristics
In the above experiments, Wuhan and Hubei were regarded as a whole, and then the
impact of under-reporting on COVID-19 statistical characteristics estimation was inferred.
However, spatial heterogeneity was a universal feature of spatial data. Therefore, we further
explored the spatial differences of statistical characteristics of healthcare workers infection data
in different counties of Wuhan. Figure 16 (a) shows the infection curve of healthcare workers
in different counties of Wuhan, and Figure 16 (b) shows the relationship between the distance
from the county center to the infection source and the infection peak. The results showed that
the infection peak was earlier in counties close to the source of infection, and later in the
counties far away from the infection source. This indicated that the impact of under-reporting
on COVID-19 statistical characteristics estimation should also consider the spatial
heterogeneity.

distance from the county center to the infection source and the infection peak.

5 Conclusions and Future Works
An accurate estimation of statistical characteristics of COVID-19 can greatly assist in
formulating effective prevention and control measures. However, under-reporting of cases is a
very common phenomenon in fields associated with public health. If the under-reporting is not
taken into account, it is easy to lead to biased inferences (Paixão et al., 2020). Therefore, in this
paper, infection data of healthcare workers were considered as a small sample, and a novel
framework was proposed to explore the impact of under-reporting on COVID-19 infection
peak and duration estimation.
First, due the incubation period of the COVID-19, infection inventories were constructed
for the healthcare workers and the reported cases in Hubei and Wuhan. Then, based on these
inventories, the Pearson correlation coefficient was used to preliminarily explore the impact of

under-reporting on the estimation of infection peak and duration. The results show that the
impact of under-reporting on daily new cases was greater than that of cumulative cases, and
the impact of under-reporting on Wuhan was greater than that on Hubei (excluding Wuhan).
In addition, the estimation of infection peak based on daily reported cases may lag behind the
actual infection peak, and the estimation of infection duration based on daily reported cases
may be smaller than the actual infection duration.
On the basis of preliminary exploration, we further quantitatively explored the impact of
under-reporting on infection duration and infection peak estimation. Regarding the impact on
the estimation of the infection duration, we used a weighted method to integrate the estimation
results of the three distributions. The results show the infection duration estimated by the
reported cases in Wuhan may be 16 days shorter than the actual infection duration, and the
infection duration estimated by the reported cases in Hubei (excluding Wuhan) may be 12.1
days shorter than the actual infection duration. Regarding the impact on the estimation of the
infection peak, the cross-correlation function was used to integrate the estimation results from
the perspective of space and time. In the temporal dimension, the estimated infection peak of
reported cases in Wuhan was 10 days later than the estimated infection peak of healthcare
worker cases, and the estimated infection peak of reported cases in Hubei (excluding Wuhan)
was 1.4 days later than the estimated infection peak of healthcare worker cases. In the spatial
dimension, the estimated infection peak of reported cases in Wuhan was 9 days later than the
estimated infection peak of healthcare worker cases, and the estimated infection peak of
reported cases in Hubei (excluding Wuhan) was one day later than the estimated infection peak
of healthcare worker cases. The results show the impact of under-reporting cases on infection
peak estimation in spatial dimension is consistent with the impact on infection peak estimation
in temporal dimension. That is, the infection peak estimated by the reported cases in Wuhan
may lag the actual infection peak by 9~10 days, and the infection peak estimated by the cases
reported in Hubei (excluding Wuhan) may lag the actual infection peak by 1~2 days.
Additionally, we confirmed differences in the spatial distribution of COVID-19 statistical
characteristics.
The limitations of this study were as follows: (1) The infection data of healthcare workers
was not comprehensive. As the information on healthcare worker infections is published on
the official website of the Red Cross Foundation in batches, the information may continue to
be published in the future, and therefore, this article may be missing some information; and (2)
the coverage of healthcare worker infection data was narrow. This study only used healthcare
worker infection data in China to explore the impact of under-reporting cases on the infection
peak estimation of COVID-19 and lacks data analysis from other countries. In response to the
above limitations, future studies should focus on collecting further domestic and foreign
healthcare worker and patient infection data to analyze the impact of under-reporting cases on
infection peak estimation of COVID-19 more accurately and comprehensively.
