Abstract
As the COVID-19 virus spread over the world, governments restricted mobility to slow
transmission. Public health measures had different intensities across European countries but
all had significant impact on people’s daily lives and economic activities, causing a drop of
CO 2 emissions of about 10% for the whole year 2020. Here, we analyze changes in natural
gas use in the industry and built environment sectors during the first half of year 2020 with
daily gas flows data from pipeline and storage facilities in Europe. We find that reductions of
industrial gas use reflect decreases in industrial production across most countries.
Surprisingly, natural gas use in buildings also decreased despite most people being confined
at home and cold spells in March 2020. Those reductions that we attribute to the impacts of
COVID-19 remain of comparable magnitude to previous variations induced by cold or warm
climate anomalies in the cold season. We conclude that climate variations played a larger role
than COVID-19 induced stay-home orders in natural gas consumption across Europe.

Introduction
Natural gas use accounts for ≈ 38% of the fossil fuel CO 2 emissions in Europe, including the
EU27 and UK. The share of this fossil fuel in the energy mix has been growing since 1990 at
the expense of oil and coal, as it is viewed as a cleaner source of energy. The main sectors
using natural gas are the built environment (residential, public and commercial buildings), the
industry, and the electricity production. In addition to steadily growing natural gas use, the
COVID-19 pandemic profoundly disrupted economic activities and the energy demand,
beginning in early March of 2020. Specifically, the government policies restricted mobility
and confined people at home during “lockdowns,” and reduced or closed industrial and nonessential commercial activities, with impacts on gas use and pertaining CO 2 emissions.
Although such impacts have been noted by recent reports 1,2, they have not yet been
quantified and analysed in detail.

During the cold season period when the pandemic arrived in Europe, natural gas consumption
is typically high due to the heating demand in buildings, which represents 52% of the total gas
consumption from all-sectors averaged over January to June. For both residential and
commercial buildings, gas consumption is typically inversely proportional to daily air
temperature when temperatures fall below a comfort threshold “critical temperature”.

Therefore, the lockdowns occurred during a decreasing trend of the heating demand, as
temperatures increased from winter to spring. One interesting research question is to quantify
and understand the sign and magnitude of natural gas consumption changes, given the
opposing effects of people’s confinement in households (likely more gas use), the closure of
commercial and public buildings (likely less gas use) and the industry temporary shut-down
(likely less gas use). Given different national characteristics and different reductions of
industrial activities between European countries during lockdowns, a second interesting
question is how industrial gas use was affected in 2020. Natural gas use variations in the
power sector have been addressed by refs. (3,4) and will not be discussed here.

Changes in natural gas consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic translate into roughly
proportional changes of CO 2 emissions from the combustion of that fuel. Overall, across all
fuels and sectors, the reduction in socio-economic activities due the pandemic caused a strong
decrease of CO 2 emissions in Europe, and the globe. Two recent estimates of the reduction of
CO 2 emissions during 2020 have been produced, using activity data, by refs. (5,6). In both
studies, CO 2 emissions from the built environment were the most poorly constrained of all
sectors because no direct activity data was available to estimate them. Lacking natural gas
consumption data for buildings, Le Quéré et al. made the simple assumption that buildings
emissions were reduced in every country according to observed residential use of electricity
in the United Kingdom under different levels of confinements. Furthermore, the focus of their
study was to estimate the fraction of emissions reductions attributable to COVID-19, not the
total emission changes due to COVID-19 and other factors. The contribution of climate
factors was thus ignored, even though climate and weather variations strongly influence the
heating demand and emissions from gas. In contrast, Liu et al. (2020) estimated daily
residential CO 2 emissions changes during 2020 by assuming that only climate variables were
influential. They used daily air temperature data from ERA57 with pre-established
temperature functions from ref. (8) to calculate daily residential emissions in 2020,
disaggregating annual baseline emissions from the EDGAR database 9 to daily residential
emissions with population-weighted heating degree days in each country.

Here, we analysed daily natural gas use changes from January to June 2020 in Belgium,
France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and the UK (Methods). We collected
and harmonized data separated into the power generation, the industry and buildings, also
called ‘distribution’. In addition, we collected specific natural gas use data for the city of Paris

(Methods). We attempt to analyse whether there has been an increase of gas consumption in
the built environment due to a larger number of people being confined or a decrease due to
closure of commercial buildings, and to separate the effect of temperature variations from
those of socioeconomic activity changes.

Natural gas consumption variations influenced by temperature

As a first step, we analysed daily gas use within the city of Paris, which reflects only
residential, public and commercial buildings. Paris is an easy case with the same temperature
exposure and rather homogeneous housing types, dominated by collective buildings equipped
with centralized gas heaters. Figure 1 illustrates the relative impact of temperature anomalies
and lockdown measures. Figure 1a (left) shows the consumption as a function of the
reference climatological temperature of each day during the period from March 1st to June 1st,
when confinement occurred in 2020. The reference temperature increases during the period
chosen, and can be seen here as a proxy of the date. March 1st is on the left while the May
data points are on the right. At the very beginning of the period (left-most data points), the
2020 consumption appears larger than that of 2019. Yet, later on, in particular during the
confinement period, the 2020 consumption appears lower than that of 2019, which could be
interpreted as an impact of COVID-19 reducing the gas consumption. However, Figure 1b
(right) shows a different perspective: when the same data is shown as a function of the
effective temperature, i.e. normalized to remove the effect of daily temperature fluctuations
(see below) the difference between 2019 and 2020 consumptions is reduced and the scatter of
the data-points as well. These two figures illustrate clearly the important role of the
temperature to drive short term variations of gas use, and the need to account for temperature
anomalies when looking for the impact of another predictor like the COVID-19 lockdowns
severities. For the city of Paris, we conclude that there is no clear impact of the COVID-19
lockdown on natural gas consumption, despite most of the population being confined at home
under a very strict confinement.

We then analysed daily gas supply data at national scale (Methods) for eight countries that
provided separate estimates for different sectors. Compared to the Paris case, one additional
difficulty is the definition of a temperature that is representative for each country. For this,
we used the ERA-5 re-analysis 7 and calculated a population-weighted average of air
temperature over each country’s area, accounting for a temporal-lag impact of temperature:

the consumption is not only dependent on the temperature of the day, but also to that of the
previous days (a building has some heat capacity). Namely, we computed an effective
temperature based on the temperature at days D-2, D-1 and D-0, with respective weights 0.55,
0.30 and 0.15, which offers the best correlation between effective temperature and gas
consumption.

In all the countries, daily gas use shows a decreasing trend with increasing temperature in
each country, up to a temperature T crit above which there is no apparent sensitivity to
temperature. Examples of this behaviour are shown on Figure 2 for the industry and the
buildings sectors in France. For the buildings sector, it is interesting to see in Figure 2 that the
consumption during week days is larger than during weekends (Table 1). There is little
difference on slope of the T-consumption relationship for France, but the component
independent of the temperature is very significantly different between week-days and
weekends. This is counter-intuitive as one could expect a larger residential consumption
during the weekend when people spend more time at home. A likely explanation is that the
distribution data include commercial and public administration buildings that are closed
during Saturdays and Sundays. The weekday-weekend difference is rather small for Germany,
but goes up to ≈50% for France (Table 1). The industry sector shows a number of “low”
outliers for France in Figure 2, most of which are for 2020 and they all occur during the
lockdown period, according to Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker data10
(OxCGRT). Similar negative outliers are observed for the industry in Italy and Spain, but
Poland, Germany and UK show positive outliers in the first half of 2020 (Fig S1). On the
basis of these figures, we devised piecewise linear models to describe the consumptiontemperature relationships. The models were fitted against 2016-2019 daily data points with
three parameters: T crit , the base gas consumption for temperature above T crit , and the slope of
the linear relationship between temperature and gas consumption for temperatures below T crit .

Countries differences in the temperature sensitivity of natural gas consumption
There is a high correlation (R2 >0.9) between the actual consumption and the one which is
predicted by our piecewise linear models, indicating that air temperature is a very good
predictor of short-term gas consumption anomalies during the cold season, despite the large
range of mean winter temperature between southern and northern countries. Across the eight
countries analysed, the critical temperature T crit obtained from the piecewise linear models is

remarkably stable between weekdays, Saturdays and Sundays (a few tenths of a degree
differences) and varies from ≈14° in the UK to ≈16° in Italy with a broad North-South
gradient (Table 1). Conversely, the correlations for the industry sector are much smaller,
indicating that temperature is not the only predictor of industrial gas consumption variability,
and that there are country differences (Fig S1). In Poland, the Netherlands and the UK, the
slope of the industrial gas consumption v.? temperature tends to be smaller than in other
countries (Fig S1).

We found that the per capita mean slope (2016-2019) of gas consumption vs. temperature
which defines the temperature sensitivity of gas use in the distribution sector, differed
between countries, reflecting different building energy efficiency, habits of people, and
possibly prices of natural gas. The base (independent of temperature) per capita consumption
varies between 0.37 and 0.93 m3 cap-1 day-1, although Poland is an exception with much
smaller values (Table 1). The temperature-dependant sensitivity varies between 0.16 and 0.39
m3 cap-1 day-1 deg-1, again with Poland outside of this range. Poland appears to be an outlier
because it has a smaller share of dwellings and population using gas as a heating source ; Gas
represents only 7% of the heating consumption in terms of final energy use in Poland, against
41% for coal, 20% for biomass and 29% of district heat 11. The temperature sensitivity of
natural gas use per capita should be directly related to the energy need for residential heating.
Using building average national data from different databases on energy use (Methods) and
gas heated floor area, we found a strong positive linear relation with the gas used temperature
sensitivity and the per capita average gas heated floor area (Figure 3). The country with the
largest per capita gas heated floor area is the Netherlands, and the smallest is Poland. The
strong correlation shown in Figure 3 implies that the temperature sensitivity of natural gas use
per capita depends primarily on the heated floor area per capita, in other words that country
differences in insulation for gas heated buildings are of secondary importance. Using detailed
subnational data at city or district level instead of national data as in this study, may reveal
that other factors control the temperature sensitivity of gas consumption, like the types of
building (collective vs. individual) and their insulation characteristics / energy efficiency
which generally decrease with building age. It is also possible that other meteorological
variables such as humidity, surface radiation, and sunshine duration play an additional role in
determining the amount of natural gas use in the distribution sector.

Changes between the lock-down and pre-lockdown periods

We first look at changes of consumption in the distribution sector. The winter 2019-2020 has
been exceptionally mild over Europe, with a warming anomaly of ≈ 1°C from December to
March, compared to the climatology of our study period 7. At the beginning of lockdowns
however, between mid-to-late March and early-April, a succession of colder than normal
weather events occurred, bringing cold spells over western Europe. When removing the effect
of these cold spells using the piecewise linear models described above, we display in Figure 4
the relative changes of buildings’ gas consumption in France that are not explained by
temperature during the lockdown period (March 1st to June 1st) compared to the pre-lockdown period (January 15th to March 1st). In Italy, France, Belgium, Germany and Poland, we
found a relative reduction, larger than one standard deviation of variations between the two
periods during other years. On the other hand, in the UK and the Netherlands, there is a small
relative increase during the lockdown periods as compared to the pre-lockdown reference
period, but this change remains within the one standard deviation of other years. This
difference might be explained by the large share of houses heated by natural gas in UK and
Netherlands, and by less stringent lock-down measures that allowed a fraction of people to
continue to remain in workplaces. This result indicates that despite nearly all the population
being confined at home all day long in Spain, Italy and France, and the strong mobility
reduction, e.g. by 75% in France12, the natural gas consumption rather decreased than
increased. This may be due to some houses being empty compensating for other full
households, and to closed commercial and public buildings with reduced or no heating.

In the seven countries where building consumption data was available, we regressed daily
anomalies of gas consumption corrected for temperature against the OxCGRT government
response indexes, and the Google mobility indexes (relative presence at home) for the period
Mar 1-Jun 1, 2020. Significant but weak negative correlations were found for all countries,
except in Germany and UK, which had less strict confinements than other countries (Fig. S2).
These correlations between government response indexes (lockdowns severity) and gas
consumption are impaired by the sparsity of data with lockdowns lasting less than 30 days
during the cold season when gas is used for heating, and by the fact that OxCGRT indexes
take discrete values and stall to zero when lockdowns are released. Regressions with Google
mobility data were also weak, but and they show the same negative correlation sign than with
OxCGRT data. These generally negative correlations suggest that overall, empty commercial
and administrative buildings accounted a drop of gas consumption larger than any increase

from fully occupied households. Our data did not separate commercial from residential
buildings to prove this hypothesis, but an analysis of gas use data in the US confirmed that
most of the reductions in gas consumption came from the commercial sector13.

The industry sector gas consumption is not as temperature-dependent as the distribution sector
is. Nevertheless, a temperature correction was applied from linear piecewise models fitted to
daily consumption data from the industry sector (Methods) to properly identify the
consumption anomalies that are linked to the lockdown. The time series of industry gas
consumption is shown in Figure 4 for France as an example. On this figure, the impact of the
lockdown is very clear, with a strong and rapid decrease of the consumption just after the start
of the lockdown. The consumption returned to near normal values after about two weeks,
once adequate procedures had been put in place in the industries.

Figure 5 summarizes the inter-annual variations of the gas consumption during 2020 and
previous years, for both the industry and the distribution sectors. Consumption relative
deviations from normal values (2016-2019 mean) are shown. The figure also shows the
variation between “pre-lockdown” and country specific “lockdown” periods defined from
ref.14. For the industry sector, the largest impact is over Italy, with a 25% decrease in
consumption. The lockdown impact is also very clear for this sector in France, Spain, Italy
and Poland. For UK and the Netherlands, there was no decrease of gas use by the industry
during the lock down, consistent with the fact that in May 2020, these two countries had the
smallest decrease of industrial production among the 8 countries considered 15. As for the
building sector, most countries show a small decreased consumption of 10 to 20%, but there
is no such signal over Germany and the UK, where mobility was less restricted than in the
other countries studied.

Conclusions

Our results show that the largest impact of COVID-19 response measures natural gas use was
on the reduction of natural gas consumption by the industry sector in Italy (25%), France
(16%), and Spain (14%), but also considerable and shorter duration reductions in Germany
and Poland. Meanwhile, the lockdowns also caused a net decrease of gas distribution to the
built environment, by roughly 15% in each of Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Poland.
However, the anomalies in building’s gas use due to COVID-19 lockdowns (after removing

the effect of temperature), are of the same magnitude as the anomalies related to temperature
differences in normal years. Contrary to the assumption made by Le Quéré et al. to calculate
CO 2 emissions in the residential sector, our data suggest that CO 2 emissions from gas use in
buildings did not decrease in proportion to the intensity of COVID-19 confinements in each
country (Figure 5). We do not have data for residential emissions from other fuels like oil and
coal, the latter being important for heating in Poland. Nonetheless, our data suggest that
temperature is indeed the dominant factor influencing gas-related emissions in the cold
season. However, in six of the eight countries studied, we detected an additional (not
temperature-related) reduction in CO 2 emissions that we tentatively attribute to COVID-19.
Better interpretation of changes in 2020 will require more detailed spatial information about
natural gas use patterns, associated with specific building types down to city or district levels,
which is achievable through analyses of gas distribution network flows and smart-meters data.

Methods
Firstly, we collected data on daily natural gas flows towards distribution and final
consumption in each country reported by operators to the ENTSO-G transparency platform
(“Entso-G Transparency Platform,” 2020). For the 8 countries considered, daily gas deliveries
in kWh/day were downloaded from the ENTSO-G platform16 for the period of 1-1-2016 to the
latest available data. For most countries, the gas data was separated between distribution and
final consumers, the latter one typically representing industry and power plants. For Belgium,
final consumption was further divided in industrial use and power plants. For Germany, the
data available on the ENTSO-G platform appeared to be incomplete. For this reason, daily gas
consumption data was downloaded from online portals of GASPOOL (2020) and NetConnect
Germany (NCG, 2020), the two main consortia of transmission system operators in Germany,
and used instead of the ENTSO-G data. Since CO 2 emissions are highly correlated with the
energy content of the gas, no further conversion was necessary. The so-called distribution
sector in ENSTO-G corresponds to the consumption of gas in the built environment as a
whole, and dominates the total gas consumption in each country. The data did not separate
commercial, public and residential private buildings. For this sector, gas is mainly used for
space heating and secondarily for cooking and hot water production. The distribution sector
therefore shows a strong seasonal cycle with a peak consumption in winter, and fluctuations
that relate to temperature anomalies. The power sector gas consumption shows very large
variations linked to the total electricity demand, the weather-driven supply of solar and wind
renewable electricity, the availability of nuclear, the relative distribution between coal, oil and

gas that depends on market prices and climate policies. It is difficult to identify the impact of
lockdown measures on gas consumption time series for the power sector, given the combined
effects from other sources of electricity. The power sector is therefore excluded from our
analysis. Additionally, we obtained daily consumption data for the City of Paris,
(administrative jurisdiction, 2.18 million people 17) based on local pipeline flows. Since there
is almost no industry in the jurisdiction of Paris, all the use of natural gas can be assumed to
come primarily from the residential sector.

Secondly, we collected daily index values summarizing government responses to the COVID19, given by the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) 10. The
OxCGRT contains 19 indicators, grouped into “containment and closure policies”, “economic
policies”, “health system policies” and “miscellaneous policies”. Specific to the consumption
in the distribution sector, we selected the “stay-at-home requirements”. National containment
and closure measures were adopted in Italy on March 9th with closure of all schools, most
services and a large fraction of industrial activities. Similar measures followed in Spain on
March 15th, in France on March 17th and in the UK on March 23rd. In other countries like the
Netherland, Germany or Poland studied here, the confinement measures were not as severe.
These measures have had a large impact on people’s daily life and caused an economic
downturn. A GDP reduction of more than 15% has been reported for Italy, Spain and France
18

.

Thirdly, we collected the Google Community Mobility Reports representing how frequency
of visits and duration of stays change against a baseline period (median value from the 5week period Jan 3-Feb 6, 2020), at different places. For the gas consumption in the
distribution sector, we selected the data for “residential”.
Last, we collected national data on building types from a cross analysis of the databases of 11
and the Eurostat 19. We extracted data on country population, final end uses of energy sources
(power, gas, oil, coal, biomass) for commercial buildings, non-residential buildings, separated
into energy used for space heating only and other end uses, average dwelling area, and total
number of dwellings. These data are used to understand the country-specific characteristics of
gas consumption changes with temperatures during the heating season.

Figure 1. Daily gas consumption within the Paris city from March 1st to mid-June of 2019
and 2020. The gas consumption is shown as a function of the climatological temperature (a
proxy of the date; left) and as a function of the effective temperature (right) i.e. normalized to
remove the effect of daily temperature fluctuations (see text). Filled symbols are for the
weekdays whereas the open symbols are for week-ends and holidays.

Figure 2. Daily gas consumption in France as a function of the effective temperature (see text)
by the industry (left) and to the built environment, also called ‘distribution’ (right).

Figure 3. Regression between the temperature sensitivity of natural gas deliveries to the
distribution network (the increase in per capita consumption per unit decrease of effective air
temperature) and the per capita housing area, for houses heated by natural gas. The strong
regression between the six countries suggests that building insulation and energy efficiency
differences have small effects in controlling the sensitivity, as compared to the space available
per capita.

Figure 4. Time series of the daily natural gas consumption by the industry (left) and
distribution to the built environment sector (right). Gas consumption values have been
corrected for temperature anomalies using piecewise linear models, as in Figure 2, and time
series are made smoother using the boxcar method over a period of 7 days.

Figure 5. Deviations of the gas consumption in the built environment (distribution) in 2020
compared to the 2016-2019 mean. Two periods are considered: mid-January to end of
February (left) and the first confinement period, which is country-specific (right). The bars
indicate the range of the deviation from the period 2016-2019 and provide some indications of
the inter-annual variations. For each country, the bar on the left is for the pre-confinement
period, while the bar on the right is for the confinement period. The thin black lines indicate
the variations for each individual year of the 2016-2019 period. The red lines show the 2020
values. All gas consumptions have been corrected for temperature anomalies.
