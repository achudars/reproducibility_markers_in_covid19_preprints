Abstract
I estimate the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model
for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The transmission rate is heterogeneous across countries and far exceeds the recovery rate, which enables a fast spread. In the benchmark model, 28% of the population
may be simultaneously infected at the peak, potentially overwhelming
the healthcare system. The peak reduces to 6.2% under the optimal mitigation policy that controls the timing and intensity of social distancing.
A stylized asset pricing model suggests that the stock price temporarily
decreases by 50% in the benchmark case but shows a W-shaped, moderate
but longer bear market under the optimal policy.

Introduction

The novel coronavirus disease that was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 (COVID-19) is quickly spreading around the world. As of March
27, 2020, the total number of cases exceeds 460,000 and the disease has claimed
more than 20,000 lives globally. Since March 2020, while new cases in China
appears to have settled down, the number of cases are exponentially growing in
the rest of the world. To prevent the spread of the new virus, many governments
have introduced draconian measures such as restricting travel, ordering social
distancing, and closing schools, bars, restaurants, and other businesses.
In a time of such extreme uncertainty, making economic decisions becomes
challenging because pandemics are rare. The most recent comparable episode
is the Spanish flu of 1918 (Trilla et al., 2008), so pandemics are likely to occur
at most once during one’s lifetime. Nevertheless, individuals need to make
everyday decisions such as how to manage inventories of staples, how much to
consume and save, when to buy or sell stocks, etc., and these decisions depend
on the expectation of how long and severe the epidemic is. Governments must
also make decisions such as to what extent imposing travel restrictions, social
distancing, closure of schools and businesses, etc., and for how long (Anderson
et al., 2020).

When past experience or data are not so relevant in new situations such as
the COVID-19 pandemic, simple mathematical models are useful in analyzing
the current situation and predicting the near future. This paper aims to help
decision making by building a mathematical epidemic model, estimating it using
the up-to-date data of COVID-19 cases around the world, making out-of-sample
predictions, and discussing optimal policy and economic impact. The model
is the Kermack and McKendrick (1927) Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)
model and is relatively simple. An infected individual interacts with other agents
and transmits the disease at a certain rate if the other agent is susceptible. An
infected individual also recovers (or dies) at a certain rate. The model can
be described as a system of ordinary differential equations, which is nonlinear
due to the interaction between the infected and susceptible. The behavior of
the model is completely determined by the transmission rate (β), the recovery
rate (γ), and the initial condition. Despite the nonlinearity, the model admits
an exact analytical solution in parametric form (Harko et al., 2014), which
is convenient for estimation and prediction. Using this model, I theoretically
derive the condition under which an epidemic occurs and characterize the peak
of the epidemic.
I next take this model to the data. Because the situation and policies surrounding COVID-19 is rapidly evolving, I use the most recent two weeks (14
days) of cases and estimate the model parameters by nonlinear least squares.
Except for China, Japan, and Korea, which are early epicenters of the outbreak,
the transmission rate β is around 0.2–0.4 and heterogeneous across countries.
The estimated transmission rates far exceed the recovery rate γ, which is about
0.1 based on the clinical course of COVID-19. Due to the high transmission
rate and lack of herd immunity, in the absence of mitigation measures such as
social distancing, the virus spreads quickly and may infect around 30 percent
of the population at the peak of the epidemic. Using the model, I conduct an
experiment where the government introduces temporary mitigation measures
and succeeds in reducing the transmission rate. If the mitigation measures are
taken too early, the peak is delayed but the epidemic restarts with no effect on
the peak because the population does not acquire herd immunity. Assuming the
government can take drastic measures up to 12 weeks, the optimal policy is start
mitigation measures once the number of cases reaches 6.3% of the population.
Under the optimal policy, the peak infection rate reduces to 6.2%. Therefore
unless vaccines are expected to be developed in the near future, the draconian
measures currently taken in many countries may be suboptimal, and it may be
desirable to postpone them.
To evaluate the potential economic impact of COVID-19, I build a stylized
production-based asset pricing model. Capitalists hire labor at competitive
markets and infected workers are unable to work. Because the epidemic (temporarily) drastically reduces the labor supply, output goes down and the model
calibration suggests that the stock market crashes by 50% during the epidemic,
though the crash is short-lived. Under the optimal policy, the stock price exhibits a W-shaped pattern and remains about 10% undervalued than the steady
state for about half a year.

SIR epidemic model

I first present the compartment model of epidemics following Kermack and
McKendrick (1927).
The society consists of N individuals, among which S are susceptible to
an infectious disease (they are neither infected nor have immunity) and I are
infected. (We ignore population growth because an epidemic occurs in a relatively short interval.) Let R = N − S − I be the number of individuals who
are immune (possibly because they are vaccinated, infected and recovered, or
dead). Suppose that individuals meet each other randomly, and conditional of
an infected individual meeting a susceptible individual, the disease is transmitted with some probability. Let β > 0 be the rate at which an infected individual
meets a person and transmits the disease if susceptible. Let γ > 0 be the rate
at which an infected individual recovers or dies. Then the following differential
equations hold.
dS/ dt = −βSI/N,

(2.1a)

dI/ dt = βSI/N − γI,

(2.1b)

dR/ dt = γI.

(2.1c)

To see why (2.1a) holds, note that an infected individual can transmit to β people per unit of time if all of them are susceptible, but the probability of meeting
a susceptible individual is only S/N . Thus, I infected individuals can transmit
to I ×β ×(S/N ) = βSI/N individuals per unit of time. (2.1b) holds because the
change in the number of infected individuals equals the newly infected minus
closed cases (either due to recovery or death).
Letting x = S/N , y = I/N , z = R/N be the fraction of susceptible, infected,
and recovered individuals in the society, dividing all equations in (2.1) by N ,
we obtain
ẋ = −βxy,

(2.2a)

ẏ = βxy − γy,

(2.2b)

ż = γy,

(2.2c)

where ẋ = dx/ dt. Although the system of differential equations (2.2) is nonlinear, Harko et al. (2014) obtain an exact analytical solution in parametric
form.
Proposition 2.1. Let x(0) = x0 > 0, y(0) = y0 > 0, z(0) = z0 ≥ 0 be given,
where x0 + y0 + z0 = 1. Then the solution to (2.2) is parametrized as
x(t) = x0 v,

Proof. See Equations (26)–(29) in Harko et al. (2014). The parametrization has
been changed slightly for convenience.
Using Proposition 2.1, we can study the qualitative properties of the epidemic.
Proposition 2.2. Let everything be as in Proposition 2.1. Then the followings
are true.
1. In the long run, fraction v ∗ ∈ (0, 1) of susceptible individuals will not be
infected (fraction 1 − v ∗ infected), where v ∗ is the unique solution to
x0 (1 − v) + y0 +

2. If βx0 ≤ γ, then dy/ dt ≤ 0: there is no epidemic. Furthermore, v ∗ → 1
as y0 → 0.
3. If βx0 > γ, then there is an epidemic. The number of infected individuals
reaches the maximum when βx(tmax ) = γ, at which point the fraction
ymax = y(tmax ) =

Since f (1) = y0 > 0, it must be v(0) = 1. The definite integral (2.7) is welldefined in the range f (v) > 0. Since

f is concave so the set V = {v ∈ (0, 1] | f (v) > 0} is an interval. Since f (v) →
−∞ as v ↓ 0, we have V = (v ∗ , 1] for v ∗ ∈ (0, 1), where v ∗ solves (2.5). Because
f can be approximated by a linear function around v ∗ , we get

dξ

v ∗ βξf (ξ)
so v(∞) = v ∗ . Using (2.3a), in the long run fraction x(∞)/x0 = v ∗ of susceptible
individuals are not infected.
Since f (v) > 0 on V = (v ∗ , 1], we have v(t) ∈ (v ∗ , 1] for all t ≥ 0. By (2.7),
v(t) is clearly decreasing in t. If βx0 ≤ γ, it follows from (2.3b) that

because v̇ ≤ 0 and v ≤ 1 implies γ − βx0 v ≥ γ − βx0 ≥ 0. Since f (1) = 0 when
y0 = 0, f 0 (1) = −x0 + γ/β ≥ 0 if βx0 ≤ γ, and f 00 (v) < 0, it must be v ∗ → 1 as
y0 → 0.
Finally, assume βx0 > γ. Then ẏ(0) = (βx0 − γ)y0 > 0, so y(t) initially
increases. By (2.2b), y(t) reaches the maximum when 0 = ẏ = βxy − γy ⇐⇒
γ

x = γ/β. Using (2.3a), this is achieved when γ/β = x0 v ⇐⇒ v = βx

Substituting into (2.3b), we obtain (2.6). Letting
y(θ, x0 , y0 ) = θ log

θ

for θ = γ/β, it follows from simple algebra that
∂y/∂y0 = 1,

∂y/∂θ = log

∂y/∂x0 = −

so ymax is increasing in x0 , y0 and decreasing in θ = γ/β.
Proposition 2.2 has several policy implications for dealing with epidemics.
First, the policy maker may want to prevent an epidemic. This is achieved
when the condition βx0 ≤ γ holds. Since before the epidemic the fraction of
infected individuals y0 is negligible, we can rewrite the no-epidemic condition as
β(1−z0 ) ≤ γ. Unlike bacterial infections, for which a large variety of antibiotics
are available, there is generally no curative care for viral infections.1 Therefore
the recovery/death rate γ is generally out of control. Hence the only way to
satisfy the no-epidemic condition β(1 − z0 ) ≤ γ is either (i) control transmission
(reduce β), for example by washing hands, wearing protective gear, restricting
travel, or social distancing, or (ii) immunization (increase z0 ). The required
minimum immunization rate to prevent an epidemic is z0 = 1 − γ/β.
Second, the policy maker may want to limit the economic impact once an epidemic occurs. Because the supply of healthcare services is inelastic in the short
run, it is important to keep the maximum infection rate ymax in (2.6) within
the capacity of the existing healthcare system. This is achieved by lowering the
transmission rate β.

Estimation and prediction

In this section I estimate the SIR model in Section 2 and use it to predict the
evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic.

3.1

Data

The number of cases of COVID-19 is provided by Center for Systems Science
and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University (henceforth CSSE). The cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths can be downloaded from the GitHub
1 Currently,

the only viruses against which antiviral drugs are available are the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes, hepatitis, and influenza viruses. See Razonable (2011)
for a review of treatments of the latter three viruses.

5

repository.2 The time series starts on January 22, 2020 and is updated daily.
Because countries are added as new cases are reported, the cross-sectional size
increases every day. For the majority of countries, the CSSE data are at country level. However, for some countries such as Australia, Canada, and China,
regional data at the level of province or state are available. In such countries,
I aggregate across regions and use the country level data. Figure 1 shows the
number of COVID-19 cases in early epicenters, namely China, Iran, Italy, Japan,
and Korea.

Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases in early epicenters.

3.2

Estimation

Estimation of the model poses significant challenges because the situation of
COVID-19 is rapidly evolving. The model parameters are likely time-varying
because new policies are introduced on a day-to-day basis, temperature and
weather may affect the virus activity, and the virus itself my genetically mutate.
For this reason, I only use the data from the two most recent weeks (14 days).
I estimate the model parameters by nonlinear least squares, minimizing the
distance between model outputs (x, y, z) and data. Because the CSSE data only
contains confirmed cases and deaths, but the SIR model abstracts from death,
I define c = y + z = 1 − x to be the fraction of infected or recovered cases in
the model. The counterpart in the data is b
c = C/N , where C is the number
of confirmed cases and N is population.3 Because the number of cases grows
by many orders of magnitude within a short period of time, I define the loss
function using log cases:

L(β, γ, y0 , z0 ) =
(log b
c(t) − log c(t)) .
(3.1)
t

csse_covid_19_time_series
3 I use the 2015 population data from World Bank at https://data.world/worldbank/
total-population-per-country.

6

Since I only include c in the loss function (3.1), the parameters γ and z0 ,
which govern the dynamics of fraction of recovered z, are not identified. Therefore I exogenously fix these two parameters. For the recovery rate γ, because the
majority of patients with COVID-19 experience mild symptoms that resemble
a common cold or influenza (Zhou et al., 2020), which takes about 10 days to
recover, I set γ = 1/10 = 0.1. For z0 , I set it to one divided by population.4
Although the fraction of cases c(t) is likely significantly underestimated because
infected individuals do not appear in the data unless they are tested, it does not
cause problems for estimating the parameter of interest (the transmission rate
β) because under-reporting is absorbed by the constant y0 in (2.3b), which only
affects the onset of the epidemic by a few weeks without changing the overall
dynamics (see Figure 5). To sum up, I estimate the remaining parameters β
and y0 by numerically minimizing the loss function (3.1). Standard errors are
calculated using the asymptotic theory of M -estimators. See Appendix A for
the solution algorithm of the SIR model.

3.3

Results

I estimate the SIR model for all countries that meet the following inclusion criteria: (i) the number of confirmed cases as of March 27, 2020 exceeds 1,000, and
(ii) the number of confirmed cases at the beginning of the estimation sample
exceeds 10. These countries are mostly early epicenters (China, Japan, Korea),
European countries, and North America. Table 1 shows the estimated transmission rate (β), its standard error, the fraction of infected individuals at the
peak (ymax ), number of days to reach the peak (tmax ), and the fraction of the
population that is eventually infected. Figure 2 shows the time evolution of
COVID-19 cases in Italy, which is the earliest epicenter outside East Asia.

Figure 2: Time evolution of COVID-19 cases in Italy.
We can make a few observations from Table 1. First, the estimated transmission rates are heterogeneous across countries. While β is low in China, the

origin of COVID-19, and the neighboring countries (Japan and Korea), where
the virus spread first, β is very high at around 0.2–0.4 in other countries and the
no-epidemic condition βx0 ≤ γ fails. Despite the short time series (14 days),
the transmission rate is precisely estimated in most countries. Although current
data is insufficient to draw any conclusion, there are a few possible explanations
for the heterogeneity of β. First, the transmission rate β may artificially appear
high in later epicenters such as Europe and North America just because these
countries were slow in adopting tests of COVID-19 and the testing (hence reporting) rate is increasing. Second, the heterogeneity in β may be due to the
fact that early epicenters have already taken mitigation measures of COVID19. For example, while Japan closed all schools starting on March 2, many
states in US have implemented similar measures such as closing schools, bars,
8

and restaurants only around March 16, so we may not have yet seen the effect
of such policies. Finally, it is possible that there are cultural differences. For
example, school children in Japan are taught to wash their hands before eating
and to gargle after returning home, which they practice, and (from personal
experience) Japanese cities tend to be much cleaner than most cities in the
world.
Second, according to the model, countries other than China, Japan, and
Korea are significantly affected by the epidemic. If the current trend in the
transmission rate β continues, the epidemic will peak in May 2020, at which
point around 30 percent of the population will be infected by the virus simultaneously. By the time the epidemic ends, more than 90 percent of the population
is eventually infected. These numbers can be used to do a back-of-the-envelope
calculation of health outcomes. In February 2020, the cruise ship Diamond
Princess was put under quarantine for two weeks after COVID-19 was detected.
All passengers were tested and tracked, among whom 712 tested positive and 8
died. Although this is not a representative sample because the cruise ship passengers tend to be older and wealthier, the mortality of COVID-19 should be
around 1% for this group and possibly lower for the general population. Zhou
et al. (2020) document that 54 patients died among 191 that required hospitalization in two hospitals in Wuhan. Therefore the ratio of patients requiring
hospitalization to death is 191/54 = 3.56. Thus, based on the model, the fraction of people requiring hospitalization at the peak is ymax × 0.01 × 3.56 = 1.0%
assuming ymax = 28%, the median value in Table 1.

3.4

Optimal mitigation policy

Using the estimated model parameters, we can predict the course of the epidemic. For this exercise, I consider the following scenario. The epidemic starts
with the initial condition (y0 , z0 ) = (10−8 , 0). The benchmark transmission rate
is set to the median value in Table 1, which is β = 0.29. When the number
of total cases c = y + z exceeds 10−5 , the government introduces mitigation
measures such as social distancing, and the transmission rate changes to either
β = 0.2 or β = 0.1.5 Mitigation measures are lifted after 12 weeks and the
transmission rate returns to the benchmark value. I also consider the optimal
mitigation policy, where the government chooses the threshold of cases c̄ to introduce mitigation measures as well as the transmission rate β to minimize the
maximum infection rate ymax .
Figure 3 shows the fraction of infected and recovered over time. When the
government introduces early but temporary mitigation measures (left panel), the
epidemic is delayed but the peak is unaffected. This is because the maximum
infection rate ymax in (2.6) is mostly determined by β and γ since (x0 , y0 ) ≈
(1, 0), and the epidemic persists until the population acquires herd immunity
so that the no-epidemic condition βx ≤ γ holds. While early drastic mitigation
measures might be useful to buy time to develop a vaccine, they may not be
effective in mitigating the peak unless they are permanent.
The right panel in Figure 3 shows the course of the epidemic under the
optimal policy, which is to introduce mitigation measures such that β = 0.13
5 Using high-frequency data on influenza prevalence and quasi-experimental variation in
mitigation measures, Adda (2016) documents that school closures and travel restrictions are
generally not cost-effective.

9

when the number of cases reaches c̄ = 6.3% of the population. Under this
scenario, only ymax = 6.2% of the population is simultaneously infected at the
peak as opposed to 28% under the benchmark scenario. The intuition is that by
waiting to introduce mitigation measures, a sufficient fraction of the population
is infected (and acquires herd immunity) and thus reduces the peak.

Figure 3: Dynamics of epidemic with mitigation measures.

Asset pricing with epidemic

To evaluate the economic impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, in this section I
solve a stylized production-based asset pricing model.6

4.1

Model

The economy consists of two agent types, capitalists and workers, who respectively own the capital stock and labor. The capital stock at time t is denoted
by Kt . The capital growth rate is exogenous, lognormal, and i.i.d. over time:
log(Kt+1 /Kt ) ∼ N (µ, σ 2 ).
Capitalists hire labor at competitive markets and produce a perishable good
using a Cobb-Douglas production technology Y = K α L1−α , where α ∈ (0, 1) is
the capital share. The labor supply is exogenous, deterministic, and normalized
to 1 during normal times. During an epidemic, workers are either susceptible,
infected, or recovered, and only non-infected agents can supply labor. For simplicity, I assume that workers are hand-to-mouth and consume the entire wage.
The financial market is complete, and capitalists maximize the constant relative
risk aversion (CRRA) utility

where β > 0 is the discount factor and γ > 0 is the relative risk aversion
coefficient. A stock is a claim to the representative firm’s profit K α L1−α − wL,
where w is the wage.
6 Eichenbaum et al. (2020) build a quantitative macroeconomic model where economic
activity (consumption and work) affects the transmission rate during an epidemic and discuss
the optimal containment policy. On the empirical side, Karlsson et al. (2014) find that the
1918 Spanish flu had negative effects on poverty and capital income but no effect on earnings.

∞

Given the sequence of labor supply {Lt }t=0 , we can solve for the equilibrium
stock price semi-analytically as follows. The first-order condition for profit maximization implies w = (1 − α)(K/L)α . Hence the firm’s profit, which by market
clearing must equal consumption of capitalists, is
C = K α L1−α − wL = αK α L1−α .

(4.1)

Because the marginal buyer of the stock is a capitalist, the stochastic discount
factor of the economy is given by Mt+1 = β(Ct+1 /Ct )−γ . Letting Pt be the
stock price, the no-arbitrage condition implies

Because capital growth is i.i.d. normal and labor supply is deterministic, we can

Vt = κ(Lt+1 /Lt )(1−α)(1−γ) (Vt+1 + 1),

where κ = βeα(1−γ)µ+[α(1−γ)] σ /2 . In normal times, we have Lt ≡ 1 and

Vt ≡ 1−κ
straightforward to compute the price-dividend ratio by iterating (4.3) using the
κ
boundary condition V∞ = 1−κ
.

4.2

Calibration

I calibrate the model at daily frequency. I set the capital share to α = 0.38
and the relative risk aversion to γ = 3, which are standard values. I assume
a 4% annual discount rate, so β = exp(−0.04/Nd ), where Nd = 365.25 is the
number of days in a year. To calibrate capital growth and volatility, note that
in normal times we have L = 1 and hence Y = K α . Taking the log difference,
we obtain log(Yt+1 /Yt ) = α log(Kt+1 /Kt ). Therefore according to the model,
capital growth rate and volatility are 1/α times those of output. I calibrate
these parameters from the US quarterly real GDP per capita in 1947Q1–2019Q4
and obtain µ = 0.0511 and σ = 0.0487 at the annual frequency.7 For the
transmission rate, using the point estimates in Section 3, I consider β0 = 0.29.
The recovery rate is γ0 = 0.1. The initial condition is (y0 , z0 ) = (10−8 , 0).

stock market crash is short-lived and prices recover quickly after the epidemic.
This observation is in sharp contrast to the prediction from rare disasters models
(Rietz, 1988; Barro, 2006), where shocks are permanent. Under the optimal
policy, because the infection rate y has two peaks, the stock price shows a Wshaped pattern. However, the decline is much more moderate at around 10%.

Conclusion

Because the situation with COVID-19 is rapidly evolving, any analysis based
on current data will quickly become out of date. However, any analysis based
on available data is better than no analysis. With these caveats in mind, I draw
the following conclusions from the present analysis.
The COVID-19 epidemic is spreading except in China, Japan, and Korea.
In many countries the transmission rate at present (March 27, 2020) is very
high at around β = 0.3. This number implies that it takes only 1/β ≈ 3 days
for a patient to infect another individual. Since it takes around 10 days to
recover from the illness, the number of patients will grow exponentially and
may overwhelm the healthcare system if no actions are taken. If the current
trend continues, the epidemic will peak in early May 2020 in Europe and North
America, at which point around 30 percent of the population will be infected.
Because the recovery rate γ is an uncontrollable biological parameter, the only
way to control the epidemic is to reduce the transmission rate β, perhaps by
restricting travel or social distancing. However, temporary measures only slows
the onset of the epidemic but has no effect on the peak because the epidemic
persists until the population acquires herd immunity. The optimal policy that
minimizes the peak is to wait to introduce mitigation measures until a sufficient
fraction of the population is infected, which can reduce the peak to 6.2%. Policy
makers in affected countries may also want to look at measures taken in China,
Japan, and Korea, which are the countries relatively successful at controlling
the spread so far.
Using the estimated transmission rates, I have solved a stylized productionbased asset pricing model. The model predicts that the stock price decreases by
50% during the epidemic, but recovers quickly afterwards because the epidemic
is a short-lived labor supply shock. Under the optimal policy, the stock price
exhibits a W-shaped pattern and remains about 10% undervalued than the
steady state level for half a year.

Solving the SIR model numerically

In principle, solving the SIR model numerically is straightforward using the
following algorithm.
1. Given the parameters (β, γ) and initial condition (x0 , y0 ), solve for v ∗ as
the unique solution to (2.5).
2. Take a grid 1 = v0 > v1 > v2 > · · · > vN > v ∗ . For each n = 1, . . . , N ,
compute the integral
Z vn−1
dξ
In =
(A.1)
ξ(βx0 (1 − ξ) + βy0 + γ log ξ)
vn
numerically.
Pn
3. Define t0 = 0 and tn = k=1 In for n ≥ 1. Compute (xn , yn , zn ) using
N
(2.3) evaluated at v = vn . Then {tn , (xn , yn , zn )}n=0 gives the numerical
solution to the SIR model.
Although the above algorithm is conceptually straightforward, there are two
potential numerical issues. First, the integrand
g(ξ) :=

1
ξ(βx0 (1 − ξ) + βy0 + γ log ξ)

(A.2)

in (2.4) is not well-behaved near ξ = 1. In fact, setting ξ = 1 we obtain
g(1) = 1/βy0 , which is typically a very large number since y0 (the fraction of
infected at t = 0) is typically small, say of the order 10−6 . This makes the
numerical integral In in (A.1) inaccurate for small n. Second, for applications
N
we would like the dates {tn }n=0 to be well-behaved (say approximately evenly
N
spaced), which requires an appropriate choice of the grid {vn }n=0 .
To deal with the first issue, let us express g as g = h1 + h2 , where h1
has a closed-form primitive function and h2 is well-behaved near ξ = 1. Since
log ξ ≈ ξ − 1 near ξ = 1, a natural candidate is
h1 (ξ) :=
=

1
ξ(βx0 (1 − ξ) + βy0 + γ(ξ − 1))

(β(x0 + y0 ) 6= γ)
(β(x0 + y0 ) = γ)

Then by simple algebra, (2.4) becomes

ξ(βx0 (1 − ξ) + βy0 + γ log ξ) ξ((βx0 − γ)(1 − ξ) + βy0 )
14

(A.4)

Because h2 (ξ) is approximately 0 to the first order around ξ = 1, we can calculate the numerical integrals in (A.1) accurately.
To deal with the second issue, consider the SIR model (2.2) with γ = 0.
Then (2.2a) becomes ẋ = −βx(1 − x), and by separation of variables we obtain
the analytical solution
x0
.
x(t) =
x0 + (1 − x0 )eβt
Using (2.3a), for the case γ = 0, time t and parameter v are related as
v=

1
.
x0 + (1 − x0 )eβt

Define t∗ by
v∗ =

1
1
1/v ∗ − x0
∗
⇐⇒
t
=
log
.
x0 + (1 − x0 )eβt∗
β
1 − x0

Finally, define
vn =

1
.
x0 + (1 − x0 )eβt∗ n/N

Then tn implied by (2.4) is evenly spaced when γ = 0, and we can expect that
N
N
the grid {vn }n=0 gives reasonable values of {tn }n=0 even when γ > 0.
For numerical implementation, I set N = 1000 and use the 11-point GaussLegendre quadrature and (A.3) to numerically compute the integral in (A.1).
Figure 5 shows the dynamics of SIR model when (β, γ) = (0.2, 0.1), y0 =
10−6 , 10−5 , 10−4 , and z0 = 0. For this example, 1 − v ∗ = 80.0% of the population is eventually infected, and ymax = 15.4% of the population is infected at
the peak of the epidemic. The initial condition (y0 ) affects the timing of the
epidemic but not its dynamics.

Figure 5: Dynamics of SIR model when (β, γ) = (0.2, 0.1), y0 =
10−6 , 10−5 , 10−4 , and z0 = 0. Smaller y0 corresponds to later onset of epidemic.
