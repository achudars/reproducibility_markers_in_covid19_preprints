Abstract. How to model the 2019 CoronaVirus (2019-nCov) spread in China is one of the
most urgent and interesting problems in applied mathematics. In this paper, we propose a novel
time delay dynamic system with external source to describe the trend of local outbreak for the
2019-nCoV. The external source is introduced in the newly proposed dynamic system, which
can be considered as the suspected people travel to different areas. The numerical simulations
exhibit the dynamic system with the external source is more reliable than the one without
it, and the rate of isolation is extremely important for controlling the increase of cumulative
confirmed people of 2019-nCoV. Based on our numerical simulation results with the public data,
we suggest that the local government should have some more strict measures to maintain the
rate of isolation. Otherwise the local cumulative confirmed people of 2019-nCoV might be out
of control.

Introduction

In late December 2019, a cluster of serious pneumonia cases in Wuhan was caused by a novel
coronavirus, and the outbreak of pneumonia began to attract considerable attention in the world.
Coronaviruses are enveloped nonsegmented positive-sense RNA viruses belonging to the family
Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales which are discovered and characterized in 1965 and are
broadly distributed in humans and other mammals. In humans, most of the coronaviruses cause
mild respiratory infections, but rarer forms such as the “Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome”
(SARS) outbreak in 2003 in China and the “Middle East Respiratory Syndrome” (MERS)
outbreak in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and outbreak in 2015 in South Korea had cased more than
10000 cumulative cases. In more details, there are more than 8000 confirmed SARS cases
and 2200 confirmed MERS 2000 cases separately. Although a lot of coronaviruses had been

identified and characterized, they might be a tip of the iceberg and lots of potential severe and
novel zoonotic coronaviruses needed to be revealed.
The World Heath Organization (WHO) designated the causative agent as the 2019 novel
coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was identified by the Chinese authorities. Because Wuhan is
the capital of Hubei province and the 7th largest city China and the largest transport hub in the
central part of China, it transports millions of people to lots of cities in China and many countries
in the world everyday. Based on the special location and transport hub of Wuhan, the Chinese
government has revised the law provisions of infectious diseases to add the novel 2019-nCoV as
class A agent on January 20th 2020. Moreover, a series of non-pharmaceutical interventions
were implemented, say, rigorous isolation of symptomatic, suspected person, 14 days of isolation
for the people who traveled from one city to another, strictly prohibit the travel in the many
provinces (especially the Hubei province), the public transport is partially shut down in lots
of cities, etc. However, the effectiveness and efficiency of these interventions during the early
stage is questionable. So far, there are more than 8000 confirmed cases in Wuhan and more than
24000 confirmed cases in China, and the cumulative confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV from January
23rd to February 4th in Wuhan and mainland China are shown in Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b)
respectively. In addition, several exported cases have been confirmed in many other countries
including Japan, South Korea, Singapore, USA, Canada, Germany, France, UK, Spain, etc.

The WHO has recognized that the mathematical models of epidemic play a significant role in
informing evidence-based decisions by health decision and policy makers. In order to determine
the impact of prevention and control of infection in different positions (i.e. provinces and cities),
the strength and duration of isolation, the value for the rate of recovery, we propose a novel
dynamic system with time delay and external source in this paper. With the help of this novel
system, we are able to not only predict the trend for the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in different
districts of China but also provide some helpful suggestions to achieve the maximal protection
of population with the minimal interruption of social-economic activities.
Recently we propose a novel time delay dynamical system to describe the 2019-nCoV spread
in China [6, 7], but it is not suitable to describe the trend of local outbreak for the 2019-nCoV.
In this paper, we propose a novel time delay dynamic system with external source. In the newly
proposed system, the external source term is added which can be considered as the suspected
2

people of Wuhan (or other cities) travel to other districts of China. Moreover, we apply different
kernel function in the novel system which can describe the local outbreak of 2019-nCoV more
accurately.
The rest of paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we shall propose the notations, the
assumptions and the corresponding novel time delay dynamic system with external source. The
effective approach for estimating the parameters of novel dynamic system and the prospective
cumulative confirmed people are provided in Section 3. Based on the public data, several
numerical examples are exhibited in Section 4 to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of our
estimation scheme and dynamic system. Finally, we present some concluding remarks and
suggestions in section 5.

The Time Delay Dynamic System with External Source

In this section, we shall state a novel dynamic system with time delay and external source to
describe the local outbreak of 2019-nCoV in China. The people in our novel dynamic system are
separated into 5 kinds: external suspected people (external source), infected people, confirmed
people, isolated people and cured people. Furthermore, we apply following notations to describe
them,
• I(t): cumulative infected people at time t;
• J(t): cumulative confirmed people at time t;
• G(t): currently isolated people who are infected but still in latent period at time t;
• R(t): cumulative cured people at time t.
The assumptions of external source, spread rate β, latent period τ1 , delay period t − τ1 ,
exposed people and cured rate κ in our novel system are presented as follows:
1. The transfer of infected people is assumed to be 1-to-1. And the area with external source
and the area of destination would be specified in the system.
2. Suppose the infected person can transfer the coronavirus to others at a spread rate β,
which is defined by the average amount of people becoming infected by this person in unit
time.
3. In average, the infected people experience a latent period of τ1 days before they display
obvious symptoms. Moreover, we assume the infected person with palpable symptoms
would seek for treatment and therefore become confirmed people.
4. Some of the infected people would be exposed in the latent period τ1 until they are confirmed. The average exposed period of these people are τ1 − τ10 days, which means they
would be confirmed in the next τ10 days. Some other part of the infected people are isolated
during latent period according to investigation of diagnosed cases.
5. No matter the cumulative confirmed people J(t) are isolated before diagnosed or not, they
are consist of the population infected at time t − τ1 averagely.

6. Suppose the individual would no longer transmit the coronavirus to others when he/she is
isolated or in the treatment. Consequently, the exposed people at time t are I(t) − J(t) −
G(t).
7. It is τ2 days in average for the confirmed people become cured with rate κ or dead with
rate 1 − κ.
With the help of the notations and assumptions stated previously, the novel time delay
dynamic system with external source to describe the local outbreak of 2019-nCoV is shown in
Figure 2.

Figure 2: The demonstration of novel time delay dynamic system with the external source.
Since the novel dynamic model would be more complicated compared with the one proposed
in [6], we first provide the following general form of time delay model that is valid for various

(2.1)

In order to provide a better understanding of the dynamic system (2.1), we present some
detailed explanations as follows:
1. Ĩ is generally the increase rate of cumulative infected people I(t) at time t. The specific
form of Ĩ depends on the system is closed or has outflow/inflow, and it would be illustrate
in detail later.
2. Because all the cumulative confirmed people J(t) come from the previously infected population, the increment of I(t) at time t0 (t0 < t), i.e., Ĩ(t0 ), which means the increment
of J(t) depends on the history of Ĩ(t). If the average delay between infected time and
confirmed time is τ1 , the increase rate of J can be represented as
Z t
γ
h1 (t − τ1 , t0 )Ĩ(t0 )dt0 ,
(2.2)
0

where γ is the morbidity, and h1 (t̂, t0 ) (t̂ = t − τ1 ) is a distribution which should be
normalized as
Z t
h1 (t̂, t0 )dt0 = 1, t̂ ∈ (0, t).
0

We are able to observe that h1 (t̂, t) can be regarded as the probability distribution of
infection time t0 , and here we take the normal distribution
0 2

h1 (t̂, t0 ) = c1 e−c2 (t̂−t )
with c1 and c2 be constants.

3. The function G̃(t) is the newly isolated and infected people. The integral term in the
equation for G(t) means the people isolated τ2 days ago (averagely) and would be confirmed and sent for treatment, who would no longer be counted into to the instant isolated
population. In addition, the kernel function in the integral has the following expression
0 2

h2 (t̂, t0 ) = c3 e−c4 (t̂−t )
with c3 and c4 be constants.

4. The parameter κ is the cured rate. The time delay term is obtained similarly as that of
0 2
J(t)’s, and h3 (t̂, t0 ) = c5 e−c6 (t̂−t ) with c5 and c6 be constants.

We next derive the specific form of cases with inflow or outflow sources separately, i.e. the
specific form of Ĩ. For simplicity we consider the half open cases, i.e. with single outflow or
single inflow. The situation with both inflow and outflow can be treated based on (2.1) similarly.
It is assumed that some of the infected people of Area a would transfer to Area b. We employ
a and b to distinguish the source area and destination respectively. The dynamic system for
destination b applies the output of source area a as input. Although the cured rate and dead
rate are the same for the two dynamic systems, the isolation ratio ` and infection rate β are
different for these two dynamic systems.

Area a with single outflow to Area b For the case with merely outward transfer, the
exposed people at time t is Ia (t) − Ja (t) − Ga (t), which further make βa (Ia (t) − Ja (t) − Ga (t))
people infected with βa as the infection rate for this area. Meanwhile, ν(t)θ(Ia (t)−Ja (t)−Ga (t))
of them transfers to other regions, where θ is the coefficient of transport activity and ν(t) is
the time-dependent distribution of exposed people that are likely to move out. Consequently,
at time t the net increment of the infected number in this region is



Ĩa (t) = βa − ν(t)θ Ia (t) − Ja (t) − Ga (t) .
(2.3)
We further assume that



G̃a (t) = `a Ia (t) − Ja (t) − Ga (t)

(2.4)

which means the currently exposed people are isolated at rate `a . By substituting (2.3) and
(2.8) into (2.1), we arrive at the following expressions for the single outflow system

Area b with single inflow from Area a We next concern about another system with
single external source from Area a. The instant
people caused by existed

exposed people at time t is also assumed as βb Ib (t)−Jb (t)−Gb (t) , while the external transport
contribute to the increment is ĨIn (t), thus the total increment at that time is


Ĩb (t) := βb Ib (t) − Jb (t) − Gb (t) + ĨIn (t),

(2.6)

where ĨIn (t) is the output of source region, namely,


ĨIn = ν(t)θ Ia (t) − Ja (t) − Ga (t) .

(2.7)

The rate of isolation is still depends on the existed exposed amount of people, so we possess the
following form similarly as (2.8)


G̃b (t) = `b Ib (t) − Jb (t) − Gb (t) ,
(2.8)
where the currently exposed people are isolated at rate `b . According to (2.1), we are able to
state the novel time delay dynamic system for Area b with the external source from Area a as
follows:

In sum, the above 1-to-1 single direction model is consistent of two sets of equations corresponding to the source system and destination system. It can be observed that the source
system (2.5) of Area a is independent, which means it can be solved without any information of
system (2.9) of Area b. Conversely, the system (2.9) of Area b relies on the source system (2.5)
of Area a, so the output of Area a is applied as its input in the computation.

The Estimation and Prediction Scheme

In this section, we shall first state the optimization method to estimate some parameters of
the dynamic system (2.9) from the official data, and a prediction scheme would be presented to
forecast the tendency of outbreak for the 2019-nCoV.
Based on the information of parameters {βa , κ, `a , γ, τ1 , τ10 , τ2 } and initial conditions {Ia (t0 ),
Ga (t0 ), Ja (t0 ), Ra (t0 )} in the novel dynamic system (2.5), the cumulative cured people Ra (T )
and the cumulative confirmed people Ja (T ) at any given time T are readily to attain by solving
the novel dynamic system (2.5) numerically. Likewise, the other novel dynamic system (2.9)
can be solved with the extra information of parameters {βb , `b }, the external source ĨIn (2.7)
and the initial conditions {Gb (t0 ), Jb (t0 ), Rb (t0 )}. In the practical applications, we suggest to
apply the Matlabr inner-embedded program dde23 to solve the novel dynamic systems (2.5)
and (2.9).
In addition, the following conditions for the initial time and some parameters are assumed
in the practical applications:
1. initial conditions: On the initial day t0 , we suppose 5 people in the Area a are infected
the 2019-nCoV from unknown sources. Moreover, the confirmed, isolated and recovered
people are all 0 on the initial day. All these assumptions represent Ia (t0 ) = 1, Ga (t0 ) =
Ja (t0 ) = Ra (t0 ) = 0 and Gb (t0 ) = Jb (t0 ) = Rb (t0 ) = 0. In the numerical simulation, we
further assume that there are no isolation measures implemented before T = t0 + 15.

7

2. parameters: According to the present data, we suppose a relatively high cure rate as
κ = 0.97, the morbidity is relatively high with γ = 0.99. The average latent period τ1
and treatment period τ2 are also regarded as known according to the official data. The
average period between getting isolated and diagnosed τ10 satisfies 0 < τ10 < τ1 . The known
parameter set is summarized in Table 1.

Table 1: The settings of parameters based on the official data.
Accordingly, the rest parts of parameters that need to be estimated are as follows,
Θa := [βa , `a ]

and

Θb := [βb , `b ],

and the identifications of parameters Θa and Θb come to the following two optimization problems,

where JObs
are separately the daily official data in Area a and Area b reported by the
National Health Commission of China.
Consequently, we solve the optimization problem (3.1) to derive the parameter Θa initially. In
addition, with the knowledge of parameters Θa , we are able to predict the trend of local outbreak
in Area a and the external source (2.7) for Area b. Furthermore, solve the optimization problem
(3.2), we obtain the parameter Θb and are able to predict the tendency of local outbreak in Area
b.
The whole procedure is concluded as follows:

The Estimation and Prediction Scheme:
a , we apply the Levenberg-Marquad (LM) method or the
Step 1. Based on the official data JObs
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method [4, 5] to solve the optimization problem
(3.1), and the estimated parameter Θ∗a is obtained.

Step 2. With the reconstructed Θ∗a , one could acquire the predictions of {Ia (t), Ja (t), Ga (t), Ra (t)}
and ĨIn .
b , we solve the optimization problem (3.2) and attain the
Step 3. Based on the official data JObs
∗
estimated parameter Θb in account of ĨIn .

Step 4. The values of {Ib (t), Jb (t), Gb (t), Rb (t)} are obtained by solving the novel dynamic system
(2.9) numerically.

Numerical Simulations

In this section, we shall present some numerical experiments to verify the accuracy and
efficient of the estimation and prediction scheme. It is worth mentioning that the data employed
in our novel dynamic system are acquired from the Health Commission of each province and
city of China and the National Health Commission of China. Moreover, the data includes the
cumulative confirmed people, and the cumulative cured people and the cumulative dead people
from Jan. 23rd 2020 to Feb. 4th 2020.
In order to predict the external source, we design the time distribution of exposed people
moving out as
2
2
ν(t) = e−0.1(t−t1 ) + e−0.1(t−t2 ) ,
which illuminates there would be two peaks around February 8th and February 20th separately.
The reason for these two peaks is that the people would go back to work and school after the
Lunar New Year on the specified two days. By implementing the estimation and prediction
scheme of section 3, the estimations of parameters are βa = 0.27 and `a = 0.482, and ĨIn (t)
with diffident θ are exhibited in Figure 3.

Figure 3: The external source ĨIn (t) with θ = 5%, 10% and 20%.
For the purpose of comparing the tendency of Area b with the external source and without
it, we first show the prediction of area b without external source, which means the case with
the parameter θ = 0, in Figure 4.

9

Figure 4: Prediction without external source
It is obviously that the situation of pneumonia would tend to end at the beginning of March
and the final cumulative confirmed people would be about 500. However, by observing the
prediction of Area b with the external source in Figure 5, the increase of exposed people would
lead to the increase of final cumulative confirmed people.

(a) θ = 0%

(b) θ = 1%

(c) θ = 5%

In addition, the ending time of this pneumonia would be absolutely postpone, we show Table
2 for reference. We shall remark that the same βb = 0.2413 and `b = 0.5384 are employed for
the prediction.

Now the question comes to how to decrease the final cumulative confirmed people since
the external source is inevitable. One feasible way is the increase of isolated ratio `b , and the
numerical simulations are shown in Figure 6. We can note that the cumulative confirmed people
are sharply reduce with the high rate of isolation.

Table 3: Prediction of cumulative confirmed people with different impacts of isolated rate.
From the numerical simulations, we possess following conclusions
1. The external source plays a significant role in the dynamic system, and the prediction of
outbreak with the external source is more reliable than the one without it.
2. The inflow of exposed people would increase the final cumulative confirmed people, and
the ending time of this pneumonia would postpone.
3. To avoid of rapid increasing of final cumulative confirmed people, the local government
need to implement some more efficient restrictive policies to maintain the rate of isolation.

Conclusions

In this paper, we have proposed a novel time delay dynamic system with external source.
In this system, the suspected people of Area a transfer to Area b is concerned, and it is more
reasonable and appropriate than the one in [6, 7] to describe the trend of local outbreak for the
2019-nCoV. The numerical simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness and accuracy
of the novel time delay dynamic system with external source. Moreover, the newly proposed
dynamic system can approximate the true data quite well in this event, and it could further
forecast the trend of local event. From the numerical simulations, we would like to advice
that the local government apply some more efficient and strict measures to maintain the rate
of isolation. Otherwise the local cumulative confirmed people of 2019-nCoV might be out of
control.
At present, the parameters involved in the novel dynamic system are time-independent. In
the future work, the change in the impact of isolation and spread rate may be assumed to depend
on time so as to improve the agreement between real data and estimated solution. Besides, the
complex network and stochastic process would be concerned in our dynamic system and the
machine learning techniques would be applied to provide a better prediction of tendency for the
outbreak of 2019-nCoV.
