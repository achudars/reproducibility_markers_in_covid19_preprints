Abstract
We present results of different approaches to model the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic in Argentina, with a special focus on
the megacity conformed by the city of Buenos Aires and its metropolitan area, including a total of 41 districts with over 13 million
inhabitants. We first highlight the relevance of interpreting the early stage of the epidemic in light of incoming infectious travelers
from abroad. Next, we critically evaluate certain proposed solutions to contain the epidemic based on instantaneous modifications
of the reproductive number. Finally, we build increasingly complex and realistic models, ranging from simple homogeneous models
used to estimate local reproduction numbers, to fully coupled inhomogeneous (deterministic or stochastic) models incorporating
mobility estimates from cell phone location data. The models are capable of producing forecasts highly consistent with the official
number of cases with minimal parameter fitting and fine-tuning. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the proposed models,
focusing on the validity of different necessary first approximations, and caution future modeling efforts to exercise great care in the
interpretation of long-term forecasts, and in the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions backed by numerical simulations.

1. Introduction
Since the sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 virus in Wuhan,
China, in December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (i.e. the
severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by the virus) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March
11th 2020 and changed the way we live almost all over the
world. As of May 2020, around 4 million cases have been detected worldwide, with over 284,000 reported deaths. Great efforts are currently underway towards the characterization of the
virus and the treatment of its disease. Without the possibility
of a vaccine envisioned for the near future, disease containment
has focused mainly on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)
aimed at restricting the circulation of the population, as well as
at reducing the risk of contagion in groups of vulnerable individuals. The choice of containment strategy is a key factor to
forecast the local severity of the epidemic, as evidenced by the
outcome of divergent public health policies adapted by different
countries. It is becoming increasingly clear that the development of models to assess the outcome of alternative NPIs will
play an important role in the formulation of new public health
policies.
Determination of characteristic disease parameters. Important first contributions were carried out by studying populations for which the disease spread autonomously, allowing to
determine the characteristic parameters of the disease, such as
Ref. [1], which allowed the estimation of the effective contagion
rate and serial interval in Lombardy, Italy, or the estimation of
the infection and case fatality ratios using data from passengers
of the Diamond Princess cruise [2].

Previously developed models for seasonal influenza. SARSCoV-2 presents multiple similarities and differences with diseases caused by influenza virus that may result in respiratory
syndromes. It is then reasonable to build upon previous knowledge when attempting to forecast the evolution of the pandemic.
Previous relevant work includes Refs. [3] and [4], where datadriven agent based models were developed for modeling the
spread of seasonal influenza. In [5] the authors developed
a structured meta-population scheme integrating a stochastic
model for disease dynamics, with high-resolution worldwide
census data and human mobility patterns at the global scale. In
[6], the authors proposed a theoretical framework for the study
of spreading processes in structured meta-populations with heterogeneous agents, subject to different recurrent mobility patterns. All these examples highlight the need for a data-driven
approach capable of generating effective descriptions of complex contact patterns [7], and for the development of methods
allowing the reuse of empirical contact matrices estimated from
different demographics [8].
Some basic models adapted for COVID-19. Models specific
for the COVID-19 pandemic have been developed using wellknown compartmental models as a starting point. For instance,
in [9] the author developed a model based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for compartments of susceptible (S ),
exposed (E), infected (I) and recovered or removed (R) individuals (i.e. SEIR model) with the objective of predicting the
epidemic peak in Japan. Using this method, the author found
a basic reproduction number of R0 ≈ 2.6 by adjusting the infection rate to reproduce the accumulated number of cases reported during the first 40 days of the epidemic in Japan. As

another example, in [10] the authors developed a variant of the
SEIR model without a compartment for exposed individuals (a
SIR model) to fit data obtained from different regions of China,
also estimating the local basic reproduction number.
Regional models for the COVID-19 pandemic. Several
groups have pursued model-based analyses focused on their
own countries and regions. For instance, in [11] the authors analyzed a multi-compartmental SEIR model to estimate the maximal intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity required in the city
of Santiago, Chile, during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak,
while taking different values of the basic reproduction number
into account. In [12] the authors adapted a meta-population
mobility model to capture the spread of COVID-19 in Spain,
incorporating empirical epidemiological parameters as well as
mobility and census data. The Ferguson group at Imperial College built upon the previously mentioned models for the spread
of influenza [3, 4], with the purpose of estimating the effect of
different potential public health measures, with a focus on Great
Britain and the United States of America (USA) [13]. Nonpharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). One of the most controversial proposed NPI is the formulation of periodic quarantines,
which in Ferguson’s report are regulated by the availability and
saturation of ICU beds. This idea was taken up in [14], where
the authors proposed a cyclic schedule of 4-day work and 10day lockdown, based on the predictions of a SEIR model with
an ad-hoc square function modulation of the time dependent
reproduction number R(t).
Other models were developed to study the effect of NPIs on
smaller populations, as in the cases of studies performed using data from the Boston residential area in the US. In [15]
the authors used a data-driven SEIR model (previously developed in [8]) to test six different social distancing strategies,
namely (i) school closures, (ii) self-distancing and teleworking, (iii) self-distancing, teleworking, and school closure, (iv)
restaurants, nightlife, and closures of cultural venues, (v) nonessential workplace closures, and (vi) total confinement. In
[16], authors integrated highly detailed mobility data from cell
phone devices, together with census and demographic data,
with the purpose of building a detailed agent-based model to describe the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the Boston
metropolitan area. The model intended to explore strategies
based on lifting social distancing interventions in combination
with testing and isolation of confirmed new cases, contact tracing and quarantining of exposed contacts. A similar study was
carried out in [17], simulating the outbreak in Wuhan using a
deterministic age-structured SEIR model over a 1 year period.
The effects of NPIs were also studied in deterministic models, such as those proposed in [18], where the authors presented
a new mean-field epidemiological model for the COVID-19
epidemic in Italy that extended the classical SIR model, called
the SIDARTHE model. The model contributed towards evaluating and predicting the effects of implementing different guidelines and protocols (for example, more extensive screening for
new cases, or stricter social-distancing).
Estimations of the reproduction number. The main goal of
NPIs is to flatten the curve of total infected individuals, delaying the peak while keeping the number of cases within the ca-

pacity of the health system. Different countries have achieved
this objective with varying degrees of success, which can at
least be partially explained by their choice of NPIs. Thus, it
becomes essential to measure the relative success of each case
and to incorporate this knowledge into models capable of assisting decision makers in the formulation of new NPIs. As
mentioned before, a key parameter that reflects the dynamics
of the epidemics is the reproduction number. However, in [19]
authors found that the classical concept of the basic reproduction number R0 is untenable in realistic populations, and provides very little understanding of the evolution of the epidemic.
This departure from the classical theoretical picture is not due
to behavioral factors and other exogenous epidemiological determinants. Rather, it can be simply explained by the (clustered)
contact structure of the population. The authors also provided
evidence that methodologies aimed at estimating the instantaneous reproduction number R(t) can be used operationally to
characterize the correct dynamics of the epidemic from incidence data.
It should be noted that the correct estimation of R(t) also depends on the accurate detection of infected individuals, alongside other secondary hypotheses. In [20], the authors estimated
the contagiousness and proportion of undocumented infectious
cases in China during the weeks before and after the shutdown
of travel in and out of Wuhan. They combined data from Tencent (a large social media and technology company) with a networked dynamic meta-population model with Bayesian inference to analyze the early spread within China. Recently, in
[13] the authors used a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical
model to infer the impact of NPIs across 11 European countries. The authors studied the course of the epidemic by backcalculating infections from observed deaths, and provided confidence intervals for the impact of different NPIs on the reproduction numbers. A similar analysis was performed in [21].
Reproduction number and mobility. It is important to note
that even though NPIs can have a noticeable effect on the reproduction number R(t), their effects are not instantaneous; instead, they are modulated by the proper characteristic times of
the disease. Since R(t) is an emergent quantity resulting from
decreased social contact in large groups of individuals, proposals depending on the capacity to enforce sudden changes of the
reproduction number (e.g. as in the modulation of infection
rate by a periodic square function, as mentioned above) must
be evaluated critically. One of the keys points for understanding
the spreading of the disease is the variability in the contagion
rate and its dependence on the density and movement of people
within or between cities and regions. In this context, in [22]
the authors used cell phone data from approximately 11 million devices to study how the flow of people through the city
of Wuhan contributed to dispersing SARS-CoV-2 throughout
China. The authors confirmed the efficacy of lockdown measures for decreasing mobility, and showed that the distribution
of population outflow from Wuhan accurately predicted the relative frequency and geographic distribution of COVID-19 infections across China.

Aires and its suburbs comprise a megacity offering a unique op2

portunity to investigate how the virus spreads in large, highlyconnected, and densely populated areas, and how real-time mobility information from cell phone devices can be used to assist
the prediction of new cases with regional specificity. We believe
that the results we will present here can be useful for other researchers being challenged with the task of modeling the early
stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in very large cities or in similar demographic contexts.
With this motivation, we summarize our attempts to model
the early COVID-19 outbreak and its subsequent evolution
in Argentina with a special focus on Buenos Aires and its
metropolitan area. We caution the reader to adopt a critical
stance towards simple epidemiological models. Even when
these models are fed with population census data and realistic mobility estimates, they are fundamentally limited in what
they can tell us about the mid- to long-term evolution of the epidemic. While the simplest epidemiological models have several
limitations of their own, building more complex models does
not necessarily improve our understanding of the epidemic, and
can certainly obfuscate the basic limitations that are intrinsic to
the very foundations of the models. Here, models are considered only as ways of exploring the possible future courses of
the epidemic, without claims of accuracy, let alone of infallibility. Claims concerning the outcomes of public policies based
solely on numerical simulations should be approached with utmost care. The situation is both novel and challenging, full of
unknowns that cannot be dispelled by comparison with previous epidemics, and several of the proposed NPIs (such as the
enforcement of periodic lockdowns, or the pursuit of massive
herd immunity) are unheard of in modern public health policy. The cost of implementing such policies could be huge, and
failures could be even costlier. When advising public policy
makers, it is our position that models, no matter how detailed,
only represent one among multiple sources of information, and
should supplement the analysis of actual data, the epidemiological situation, and the advice of public health experts.
This report is structured as follows. First, we consider the
problem of interpreting the dynamics of the first cases, with
special focus on infectious travelers from abroad (Sec. 2). Next,
we ponder on the dangers of solutions based on instantaneous
manipulations of R(t) (Sec. 3). We consider focal dynamics
and how they may lead towards the homogenization of the epidemics (Sec. 4). Then, after estimating relevant parameters
from fitting the models to local data in Sec. 5, we consider coupled models (Sec. 6) and the role of mobility as estimated from
cell phone data (Sec. 7). We incorporate this data to deterministic and stochastic models, discussing their comparative weaknesses and advantages, and use them to forecast the number of
new cases based on possible changes to the isolation policy. Finally, in Sec. 8 we summarize our conclusions.

be spread between countries mostly by air travelers. Throughout this work we will consider models for the officially reported
number of infected cases. While the number of actual cases
could be larger due to undetected cases, we will assume that as
long as testing procedures and protocols are not changed, the
percentage of detected cases (with respect to the total number
of cases) remains approximately constant. Thus, restricting our
analysis to the officially reported number of cases will allow us
to decrease the number of unknowns in the system.
We will progressively move from models that assume homogeneous mixing of the population in the entire country or in
large provinces, towards more complex models, including inhomogeneous coupled models. However, we will always assume
homogeneous mixing at the level of each individual district.
Moreover, we will use cell phone data to reduce the number of
unknowns by estimating the coupling between these regions. In
our experience, and as will be shown in the following sections,

increasing model complexity without incorporating precise empirical information results in models that are hard to validate
and interpret, rapidly resulting in homogeneous mixing if ensemble averages are performed to compensate for the lack of
detailed knowledge, and thus providing very limited extra information when compared to simpler models.
A brief explanation of Argentinian demographics and the
measurements taken by the Argentinian government in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is in order. Argentina has a
total population of nearly 45 millions, distributed between 23
federal states (provinces), plus an autonomous city (the city of
Buenos Aires, or CABA). Most of the population lives in this
city (2.9 millions) plus its suburbs (the metropolitan area of
Buenos Aires, Greater Buenos Aires or AMBA, plus nearby
districts, totaling 40 districts with a population over 13 millions). The next most populated regions are the rest of the
province of Buenos Aires (PBA), and the provinces of Córdoba
and Santa Fe. The first officially confirmed case of SARS-CoV2 was an infected traveler coming from abroad identified on
March 3rd. On March 11th, all travellers from countries with
confirmed COVID-19 cases were requested to stay in isolation
for 14 days. Schools and universities were closed on March
16th, and a complete lockdown was enforced on March 19th.
Almost immediately afterwards, borders were closed except for
flights bringing stranded Argentinians back from abroad, and
vice-versa for foreigners. As a result of these measures, the
number of infectious travelers slowly increased until reaching
a maximum, and then decreased monotonously with time (see
Fig. 1). The nationwide lockdown was maintained until April
26th, when provinces with zero or very few cases were allowed
to relax lockdown rules. In contrast, densely populated areas
(over 500,000 inhabitants) or with a large number of confirmed
cases were maintained in strict lockdown for at least two more
weeks, with the possibility of further extensions to the lockdown.
As mentioned in the introduction, some of the most frequently employed epidemiological models are compartmental;
for instance, the SEIR model includes compartments for susceptible (S ), exposed (E), infectious (I), and recovered or removed (R) individuals. However, since the COVID-19 epidemic started with travelers coming from other countries, modeling the increase of infected individuals solely as an interaction with the compartment of exposed individuals will fail to
reproduce the early dynamics of the disease. As discussed next,
considering the contribution of these individuals results in more
reasonable estimates of the disease transmission rate, which are
in better agreement with those obtained in other countries by
other methods [2, 9, 10, 18]. We thus briefly summarize how
to include incoming infectious individuals in the simplest models, and then adopt the same mechanism when developing more
complicated models in the following sections.
In stochastic models, the number of infectious travelers can
be added directly to the infectious compartment. Consider a
simple stochastic SEIR model [23]:
S (t + ∆) =
E(t + ∆) =

S (t) − B(t),
E(t) + B(t) − C(t),

I(t) + C(t) − D(t) + F(t),

(3)

where R is obtained from fixing the total population N (plus the
incoming infectious travelers). Here B(t) = Bin (S (t), PE (t)),
C(t) = Bin (E(t), PI (t)), and D(t) = Bin (I(t), PR (t)) are binomial distributions with exponential probability distribution
functions PE (t) = 1 − exp(−β∆I(t)/N), PI (t) = 1 − exp(−∆),
and PR (t) = 1 − exp(−γ∆), and where β is the mean transmission rate,  is the onset rate (the inverse of the average duration
of incubation in days), and γ the removal or recovery rate (the
inverse of the average duration of the infection). The stochastic variable F(t) represents the number of incoming infectious
travelers per day (when ∆ = 1 day), and can be obtained from
official data.
In deterministic models it is better to fit the data with a
smooth function to satisfy mean field approximations. The simplest deterministic and homogeneous SEIR model can be written as

Note that a forcing term F has been also added to I, representing
the rate of change in the number of cases from the travelers (i.e.,
the derivative of I resulting from incoming infectious travelers).
We also consider a more complex SEIR model with additional
compartments that will be used many times in the rest of this
work (see, e.g., [10, 11, 24]),

(13)

Here J is the number of mild infectious individuals, I are moderately infectious individuals, and H are hospitalized individuals. F, as before, represents the rate of change in I because
of infectious travelers (we assume all detected infectious travelers are moderate, and may be hospitalized later or not). The
new coefficients are ρI (the fraction of moderate infectious individuals that are properly isolated), ρH (the fraction of hospitalized infectious individuals that are isolated), φ (the fraction
of exposed individuals with moderate to severe symptoms) and
χ (the fraction of moderate infectious individuals that do not
require hospitalization).
As mentioned before, F should be represented by a smooth
function in these ODEs. The product of two logistic functions
was found to give a good approximation to the data of accumulated infectious travelers (minus discharged cases, see Fig. 1),
and its derivative caped to only positive values (as the passage
from infectious to recovered compartments is already included
in the models) provides a smooth approximation to the daily

and a faster scale characteristic of the time dependent policies)
we will analyze the problem under the light of the averaging
theorem [25]. This theorem states that for a (slow) dynamical

Figure 2: Simulation of a deterministic SIR model for a population of 106
individuals. The infection rate parameter is periodically modulated (β0 = 0.3 ×

variations of the basic reproduction number R0 ∈ [0.8, 4.16] with a period of 10
days.

such that there is a change of coordinates mapping the solutions
of the original system into those of its associated averaged autonomous system. In other words, up to first order in , we have
that |x(t) − y(t)| ∼  (if |x(0) − y(0)| ∼ ), on a time scale t ∼ 1/.
The application of this theorem to the problem is pertinent.
Suppose several periodic interventions are expected during the
evolution of the epidemic. Let us model these with an even simpler dynamical model for an epidemic, the deterministic SIR
model:

cases (associated to F). Similar results were obtained for each
province or district with cases of incoming infectious travelers.
With the simplest SEIR model given by Eqs. (4)-(7), we adjust all the data available for Argentina as a homogeneous group
with a single local propagation mechanism, but treating separately infectious individuals from abroad. To this end, we
fix  = 1/(5.1 days) and γ = 1/(14 days) [13, 18, 10], and
we apply a least square approximation to obtain β using the
method described in [9]. Figure 1 illustrates the result of adjusting the model to the number of accumulated cases in Argentina during the first 25 days. The least square approximation
yields β ≈ 0.22 (or, equivalently, a basic reproduction number
R0 = β/γ ≈ 3), a value that will be used in the following sections. As the system evolves in time and the epidemic spreads,
the role of local infectious cases becomes more relevant, and
the forcing due to infectious travelers begins to play a smaller
role.
Equipped with this simple model and a first approximation to
the relevant parameters, we now consider some NPIs and other
proposed solutions based on numerical simulations that have
been suggested in the literature.

In these equations, the policy is translated into the periodic
modulation of β.
In Fig. 2 we compare the simulation of the periodically modulated problem with the solution of its associated averaged version. In this simulation, we studied an epidemic event lasting
100 days, with a time dependent policy of social distancing with
a 10 day period. Note that the averaged system constitutes a
good approximation of the original problem. The parameters in
our simulation correspond to R(t) ∈ [0.8, 4.16], with and average of R = 2.5. It is for this reason that in this example there
is an epidemic peak. Suppression can indeed be achieved, but
only if the average of the modulation leads to R < 1. In the
case of Argentina, which implemented a long lockdown at an
early stage of the epidemic, R(t) reached a value of ≈ 0.9 as the
most optimisic estimate (other countries reported similar values, see, e.g., [26, 18]). It is therefore very difficult (or simply
unrealistic) to implement an alternating policy that translates
into average parameters leading to suppression. Moreover, as
will be shown next, the periods without lockdown may lead to
rapid homogeneization of the infected cases in the real system,
leading to even longer times for the extinction of the epidemic.

3. A caution note on time dependent lockdowns
It has been suggested that a way to simultaneously address
the need to bound the spread of the pandemic while keeping
some significant level of economic activity is the application of
time dependent lockdowns. These policies consist in the alternation between periods during which individuals are allowed
to move, trade and travel, with others during which social interactions are minimized. Numerical simulations with time dependent parameters have been carried out to model the effect of
these policies and indeed, some of these simulations show the
suppression of the epidemic [14].
Yet, it is important to address the viability of these policies
by analyzing the general conditions under which suppression
could be achieved. Since time dependent lockdowns introduce

4. Homogeneous or stochastic? Dynamics of foci, ensembles, and homogeneization
The stochastic modeling of epidemics as in Eqs. (1)-(3) is
important when the number of infectious individuals is small,
since in those situations fluctuations can lead to the extinction
of the epidemic, even for a highly contagious disease (this can

happen, for instance, if the first few infectious individuals had
very limited contact with the susceptible population). Typically,
an epidemic outbreak starts with few infectious cases that are
spatially scattered. If the mobility of those cases is small, the
epidemic will first develop in scattered foci and then slowly
spread until all the interconnected susceptible subjects interact with the infectious population, reaching what is known as
the homogeneous situation, described, e.g., by the system of
Eqs. (4)-(7). Typically, the deterministic model used to describe
the homogeneous case is therefore thought as the appropriate
way to address the evolution of an epidemic outbreak involving
a large number of individuals. However, it can also serve as an
estimation of the result obtained by analyzing an ensemble of
stochastic simulations. To this end, in this section we consider
inhomogeneous distributions of infectious cases as obtained by
coupling stochastic epidemic models as those in Eqs. (1)-(3).
To explore the process of homogenization of the epidemic
outbreak, we performed an ensemble of stochastic simulations
of this system, with a small number of infectious subjects
seeded into a susceptible population. We assumed that the
population could be grouped into 15 regions (where the number was chosen to reproduce the internal division of the city
of Buenos Aires into so-called “communes”, note these are
smaller and different from the districts in the suburbs considered later). The number of inhabitants in each commune was
obtained from census data. In our numerical experiments, each
subject spends half of the day in its commune and a second
half either in the same or a different one (the full mathematical
details of the coupled stochastic model are described later in

Sec. 6). In the first half of the day, the probability of contagion
in the jth commune is given by:

This method of updating stochastic models every half day will
be found useful in the following sections, when we use cell
phone data to estimate actual mobility between larger districts.
We display 50 simulations in Fig. 3, starting with three cases
in one commune, with parameters that correspond to R0 = 3.92

and mobility extracted from [27]. The dashed line shows the results obtained from integrating the homogeneous model using
the parameters that correspond to the whole city. Not surprisingly, the homogeneous continuous model is a good approximation for the large population of Buenos Aires city. Yet, notice how rapidly the dynamics of the city become similar to the
dynamics of the first commune. Note again the remarkable similarity between the average of the simulations and the solution
of the continuous model in the two bottom panels representing
the first days of the stochastic simulations, their average, and
the solution of the homogeneous continuous model.
With these results in mind, we now consider the cost of letting the epidemics spread and evolve towards the homogeneous
solution. To this end we consider only one commune, and assume that as a result of the lockdown this commune becomes
isolated. Moreover, only a small fraction of the infected population gets in contact with other individuals (i.e., their social
network of contacts), resulting in a small focus. Figure 4 shows
the evolution of the number of infectious individuals in an ensemble of 200 realizations of the stochastic SEIR model with
a focus restricted to 50 individuals. The number of infectious
individuals quickly drops to zero in some realizations, while in
others infectious cases persist for longer times. The mean time
for the extinction of the focus can be estimated from such an ensemble. This is also shown in Fig. 4, which presents this time
as a function of the size of the population in the focus. Note the
exponential dependence between these quantities: avoiding the
growth of the foci becomes crucial for the long-term evolution
of the system.
Finally, the results in this section indicate that, to a certain
extent, we can approximate the dynamics in the city of Buenos
Aires (and probably as well in the individual districts of its
metropolitan area) using homogeneous models (see Sec. 5), and
then coupling these districts assuming that the mix between
them can be inhomogeneous (see Secs. 6 and 7).

We decided to fix all parameter values except for β. We introduce time dependence, β(t), to capture effective changes associated with the lockdown measures. As in previous sections, we
fix  = 1/(5.1 days) and γ = 1/(14 days). The other parameters
in Eqs. (8)-(13) were chosen as ρI = 0.2, ρH = 0.9, φ = 0.7, and
χ = 0.8, which yielded a fraction of mild, moderate, and hospitalized infectious individuals compatible with official reports
[28].
Then, we fitted the ODEs to the first 25 days of data (i.e.
up to 8 days after the beginning of the lockdown) to estimate
β0 = β(t = 0), and from the 10th day of the lockdown to the
last day with available official information to estimate the mean
β(t) during the lockdown. These two values were then interpolated with a logistic function to obtain a smooth version of
β(t) for the model (as will be shown later from the analysis of
cell phone data, this is in agreement with observations that the
mobility of individuals decreases slowly in time, starting even
before the lockdown is put in place). To produce forecasts using the model, it is necessary to calculate the errors that occur
when estimating β(t) in this way. We thus also fitted the model
to the data using least squares with a moving window of 10
days to estimate the dispersion σβ in the values of β(t). Results
for the whole nation and for the most populated province in the
country are shown in Fig. 5.
When forecasting the possible future outcomes of the epidemic, it is necessary to carry out a series of simulations with
different parameter choices. Integration of the system with

5. Estimation of transmission rates from local fitting and
first evaluation of lockdowns
To study the evolution of the epidemics in highly populated
regions using locally homogeneous models, and later incorporating coupling to reflect inhomogeneous mix between different regions, we need reasonable estimations of infection rates.
These estimations serve the double purpose of avoiding overfitting in complex models, and evaluating the effect of lockdown measures. Otherwise, conducting ensemble averages
over multiple realizations with different parameters would result again in the homogeneization of the results. In this section
we show how simple deterministic SEIR models (as the SEJIHR model in Sec. 2) can be used to estimate these parameters from the data and to study the global and local evolution
of the epidemic, assuming weak coupling between regions as a
consequence of the lockdown (as will be confirmed later in the
analysis of cell phone data).
First of all, to avoid over-fitting we choose to fix as many parameters as possible based on the literature and available data.

same qualitative behavior (but with different values of β(t)) is
observed. We conclude that inhomogeneous models with coupled districts are required, at least at this level of description.

β(t) ± 1.96 σβ allowed us to compute solutions within 95% confidence levels. Results are shown in Fig. 6. While the best fit
to the data indicates a decrease in the effective value of β(t) as
a result of the lockdown when computed for the entire country
(with a slight increase at later times), in the province of Buenos
Aires (PBA) the decrease in the value of β(t) is smaller and
presents larger fluctuations (resulting in a different increase in
the number of cases in Fig. 6). This indicates the need of factoring individual mobility in the analysis, which will be shown
next to correlate with the observed behavior of β(t). Also, note
that the uncertainty of solutions within 95% confidence intervals increases very rapidly, thus forbidding reliable long-term
forecasts of the number of cases. This behavior is to be expected in systems with solutions that grow exponentially at
early times, and provides a warning message for all attempts
at long-term forecasting of the pandemic.
Finally, when considering separate districts within PBA, the

6. Coupled models and the role of mobility
As previously done in Sec. 4, both stochastic and deterministic models can be modified to include several interacting geographical regions, each with its own transmission rate βi , and
number of susceptible (S i ), exposed (Ei ), infectious (Ii ), and recovered (Ri ) individuals. We first describe in detail a coupled
stochastic model obtained from adapting Eqs. (1)-(3) to include
empirical mobility data. Second, we introduce a coupled deterministic model. Mobility data will be introduced by quantifying
a daily mixing of individuals given by Mi, j . The i, j entry of this

total population of the i region, and i Mi, j = N ∗j is the number individuals found in the jth region during the day. Coupling
is done using the methods described in [29]. In this section and

area.

with Ri = Ni − S i − Ei − Ii , Bi (t) = Bin S i∗ (t), PE,i (t) , Ci (t) =
Bin (Ei (t), PI (t)) and Di (t) = Bin (Ii (t), PR (t)).
The update rule for the second half of the day can be obtained
from the same equations with Mi,i = Ni and 0 otherwise, and by
adding a forcing term Fi (t) to Eq. (24), reflecting the number
of incoming infectious travelers for that region. Note that the
transmission rate during the second half of the day, βi , is also
region-specific. Also, note that both βi and Mi, j may depend on
time, reflecting the changes in local and inter-regional mobility
imposed by quarantine and isolation policies.
Finally, we also consider a coupled version of the homogeneous SEJIHR model introduced in Eqs. (8)-(13). Coupling is
introduced by writing equations for S i , Ei , Ji , Ii , Hi , and Ri ,
and coupling susceptible and (mild and moderate) infectious
individuals in different districts S i I j and S i J j (with i , j) in the
equations for S˙ i and Ėi . Thus, the equations for the evolution
of S i and Ei result

As done before, in the stochastic model we divide each day
into two halves of duration ∆2 . During the first half of the day individuals interact according to a mixing matrix Mi, j , reflecting a
typical work and school day (if schools are open). In this case,
the exponential probability function for exposure to infected individuals depends on the geographical region and is computed
P
as PE,i (t) = 1 − exp(−βi ∆2 Ii∗ (t)/Ni∗ ) where Ii∗ (t) = i Mi, j I j /N j is
the number of infected individuals found in the ith region during the first half of the day. In the same way, we introduce
P
S i∗ (t) = i Mi, j S j /N j as the number of susceptible individuals
in the i − th region during the first half of the day. The probability functions PI (t) and PR (t) do not depend on the region since
they only contain parameters intrinsic to the disease.

trajectory must be considered as random, we determined the
regional membership of each phone as its most visited region
during the day (i.e., the mode of the IGN department labels).
We computed two metrics per day from this dataset. First,
we estimated the mixing matrix Mi, j by counting the number of
cell phones belonging to the ith region found throughout the day
P
in the jth region, and then rescaling rows so that j Mi, j = Ni .
We note that, since a single cell phone can be found in several regions throughout a day, this mixing matrix represents a
coarse temporal average across a time step of ∆2 in the stochastic coupled model. Better approximations could be eventually
obtained dividing each day into shorter intervals. We also computed the normalized and symmetrized contact matrix Ci, j as
described in the previous section. Figure 7 (left panel) presents
a typical contact matrix (computed for the 2nd of March), with
regions ordered according to their community membership detected with the Louvain algorithm (resolution parameter γ =
1) [30]. Figure 7 (right panel) presents a topological representation of the mixing matrix and its major communities using the Yifan Hu Multilevel layout algorithm [31] as implemented in Gephi (https://gephi.org/). The three white
diagonal squares indicate major communities corresponding to
the southern, centre-northern and western part of the metropolitan area, corresponding to purple, green and light blue communities in the right panel, respectively. Next, we estimated Mi ,
the local mobility of region i, as the average of all geodesic distances between successive latitude/longitude pairs within that
region. As described in the following sections, we use Mi to
construct an effective time-dependent and region-specific transmission rate.

(27)

where Fi is a smooth time-dependent function obtained from
the data of each district as explained in Sec. 2. As in the case
of the stochastic model, both βi and Ci, j potentially depend on
time, and , γ, ρI , ρH , φ, and χ are time- and region-independent
constants chosen as in the previous sections.
7. Mobility estimation from cell phone location data
In this section we describe the use of cell phone location
data to estimate the mixing and contact matrices introduced in
Sec. 6, as well as the effective local infection rates, focusing on
the advantages and limitations intrinsic to this type of data.
We obtained geolocated data from anonymized mobile
phones spanning the whole country between March 1st and
April 12th (≈ 3 × 106 unique phones). For each phone we
obtained a sequence of latitude/longitude pairs with an associated timestamp, each corresponding to the use of a certain
(also anonymized) app (resulting in 100 to 200 events per cell
phone per day). Each sequence of latitude/longitude pairs was
converted to a sequence of labels indicating the location among
the 529 departments in the country, as defined by the National
Geographical Institute of Argentina (IGN, https://www.ign.
gob.ar/). As in the previous sections, we restrict our analysis
to a subset of 41 departments (or districts) spanning Buenos
Aires and the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area, comprising approximately 50% of the phones in the dataset.
A major limitation of this type of data is uneven spatial and
temporal sampling. Even within the most densely sampled area
(Buenos Aires and its metropolitan area) we observed large differences in the number of cell phones relative to the total population. Since for all purposes the temporal sampling of the

Finally, we observed a strong modulation of the local mobility and the inter-regional traffic as a consequence of the lockdown starting on the 19th of March (Figure 8). Both curves
show a gradual decline during the days prior to the beginning
of the lockdown, and a very slow recovery of the circulation
during the first days of April.

districts had less than 10 reported cases at the time when this
report was written, while others had several hundreds. Also,
some districts had cases of infectious travelers coming from
abroad during the first days of the outbreak, while others reported no infectious travelers. Moreover, the first cases in each
district were reported at different days.
We integrated the model for all districts with zero cases as
initial condition, and let the incoming travelers drive the increase in the number of infected individuals. We note that in
absence of coupling, districts with no incoming infectious travelers would remain at zero cases during the integration time.
Figure 9 shows the result of integrating the model for all the
41 districts. Results are shown for five districts in the metropolitan area of the city of Buenos Aires, plus the city, corresponding
in all cases to districts that reported cases of infected travelers
coming from countries with confirmed COVID-19 infections at
the early stages of the outbreak. Note that the model correctly
captures the beginning of the outbreak in each district, as well
as the overall evolution of the epidemic, even when districts
differ in the number of cases by up to two orders of magnitude (the population does not differ that much between districts,
however). Also, note that no attempt has been made to adjust
parameters in the model to fit the observed data, besides using
the value of β0 obtained for the entire country.
The model also captures the time of the outbreak and the order of magnitude of the cases in districts that reported no incoming infectious travelers from countries with COVID-19. Figure
10 shows the evolution for four of such districts. Overall, this
indicates that modulating transmission and coupling rates using
mobility data from cell phones gives a good approximation to
the dynamics of the epidemics.
Figure 11 shows the evolution of the number of official and
forecast cases for the 41 districts in a map, for days 5, 20, 40,
and 60 since the first officially reported case in the country. The

7.1. Coupled deterministic models
For the sake of simplicity, we first consider the deterministic
model coupled using cell phone data, and leave the stochastic
model (which requires ensemble averages) for the next section.
To integrate the model, β0 is fixed at the value initially obtained
from the best fit to all cases in the country, β0 = 0.22. The
temporal evolution of the βi coefficients is approximated as
βi (t) = β0 M̂i (t),

where M̂i (t) is a temporally smooth approximation to the local
mobility Mi (t) obtained from the cell phones data, and normalized such that h M̂i (t)i = 1, where the brackets denote the time
average across the first 14 days (i.e., before the lockdown measures were in place). The coupling between districts Ci, j (t) was
computed directly from the time-dependent cell phone mobility matrix Mi, j using the definition in Sec. 6. Note that in this
way, there are no free parameters left to adjust, resulting in a
system whose dynamics can either match the official number of
cases or deviate strongly from it, depending on the validity of
the parameters, empirical sources of data, and assumptions of
the model.
We integrated this coupled model for the city of Buenos Aires
(CABA) and the 40 districts in the Buenos Aires metropolitan
area. This resulted in simulations for 41 districts with very different populations and number of infected individuals. Some

radius of the semi-transparent circles indicates the number of
cases in each district, both for the official data as for the model
output. As a result, circles with a border of a different color
indicate a disparity between the model and the data: when the
border is blue, the model predicts a smaller number of cases
than the official reports. When the border is light violet, the
model predicts an excess of cases compared with the empirical
data. Note that all differences are small. Also, note that while
in the first 5 days most cases were concentrated in the city of
Buenos Aires, the cases spread north, west and south in time,
first to closer districts in the suburbs (having more traffic and
mobility to the main city), and then from these districts to others
further apart. After 60 days, all districts neighbour to Buenos
Aires city had a large number of cases and displayed a more or
less homogeneous behavior.
Moreover, as cell phone mobility data is available daily, this
type of models can be used to forecast different scenarios by increasing mobility indices to recover pre-lockdown mobility values. In this way we can analyze possible outcomes to changes
in lockdown measurements. As an illustrative example, Fig. 12
shows the evolution of the system in the districts in Figs. 9 and
10, assuming that after the last day with available cell phone
data the mobility is kept constant (i.e., the lockdown is maintained), or mobility (inside each district as well as between districts) is raised to 30%, 60%, or 100% of its value before the
lockdown. The more evident limitations of this model are associated with the difficulty of performing uncertainty analysis,
and with the dynamics of districts with very low number of infectious individuals, where fluctuations can play a significant
role. To overcome these potential limitations, we now consider
the stochastic coupled model.
7.2. Coupled stochastic models
We now describe the results obtained from combining the
stochastic model described in Eqs. (22)-(24) with the mobility
estimates based on the cell phone data. As in the deterministic
case, we fix the initial β0 value and introduce a smooth temporal
evolution of the regional βi coefficients, informed by the initial
and final local mobility values. We use the empirical mixing
matrix Mi, j to determine the interaction between the exposed
individuals from all pairs of regions. We report 100 simulations
per region, as well as the average across all realizations of the
stochastic model. As in the case of the homogeneous deterministic model described in the previous section, we note that the
coupled stochastic model does not require parameter optimization and is fully determined by demographics, constants characteristic of the disease, information on infectious individuals
traveling from abroad, and the mobility data.
We observe that the stochastic model can reproduce the number of cases with variable accuracy, with results that are in general compatible with the official number of cases, but occasionally with severe underestimations. Figure 13 shows the results
for five representative districts which participated in the early
stages of the outbreak. We observe that the stochastic model
either provides a reasonably accurate estimate of the cumulative number of cases (e.g., for Lujn, Vicente Lpez, and CABA),

Figure 13: Number of accumulated cases in five districts of the Buenos Aires
metropolitan region, plus the city of Buenos Aires (CABA). Infectious travelers

derived a p-value by counting the number of times the goodness of fit (computed as the inverse of the mean squared error
[MSE]) of the model with shuffled Mi, j and βi was better than
the one obtained from the unshuffled data. We conclude that the
structure of the empirical mixing matrix plays a significant role
in the goodness of fit of our predictions, since the average MSE
is higher for the shuffled than for the unshuffled mixing matrix
(p < 0.001, and p < 0.05 for 17 of the regions). Conversely,
we did not find a significant effect of the local mobility. This
is consistent with cursory observations that suggest higher heterogeneity in the inter-regional mobility compared to the local
circulation.
8. Conclusions
In this work we presented results of different approaches to
model the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic in Argentina,
with a special focus on the megacity comprised by the city of
Buenos Aires and its large metropolitan area. We progressively
moved from models that assume homogeneous mixing of the
population, towards more complex models that allow for inhomogeneities between individual districts. To inform these
models, we incorporated the number of infectious individuals
arriving from other countries with confirmed COVID-19 cases
to our models, as well as cell phone data to estimate mobility
within and between districts.
First, the effects of some proposed NPI policies and the consequences of rapid homogeneization of the epidemics were considered. We conclude that it is unrealistic to implement certain policies, e.g., alternating between lockdowns and periods
of mobility. We also note that without empirical mobility estimates, performing ensemble averages varying unknown parameters over multiple realizations of coupled models results in an
evolution compatible with that of homogeneous deterministic
models, thus providing very little extra information.
It is thus apparent that in highly populated regions, the evolution of the epidemics can be modelled to a certain degree
by locally homogeneous models, and by the coupling of these
models between regions that display inhomogeneous mixing
between themselves. We showed that mixing and contact matrices estimated from cell phone data could be used to obtain
reasonable estimations of the infection rates, both for stochastic and for deterministic models. The predictions of both types
of models compared favourably to the official data during the
first 60 days of the outbreak. Crucially, this performance depended on the structure of the mixing matrix and not only on
its post-lockdown modulation, as shown by the application of
permutation tests.
Direct data analysis, as well as comparisons with the results
from the models, indicate that while in the first 5 days most
cases were concentrated in the city of Buenos Aires, the disease spread north, west and south as a function of time. The
spread occurred first to closer districts in the suburbs, and from
these districts to other further apart in the region. The models
captured this spatio-temporal evolution, including the time of
the first cases in each district, and the order of magnitude of the

metropolitan region, for districts that reported no infectious travelers arriving

or underestimates the official data. An opposite result was observed for some of the districts modeled with the coupled deterministic model (i.e., Vicente Lpez). This difference could
stem from the fact that, as opposed to the ODEs, the stochastic
model can reproduce regional extinctions in the progression of
the daily number of cases (unless driven by other region through
the mixing matrix). It is also worth noting that, in all cases, the
official data lies between different realizations of the stochastic
model.
Again, note that the stochastic model captured the time of
the outbreak, and the order of magnitude of the cases in districts that reported no incoming infectious travelers from countries with COVID-19 cases (Figure 14). Note that the stochastic model applied to this situation presents the strength of factoring in the non-negligible possibility of focus extinction, and
thus can result in forecasts following more closely the empirical
number of cases compared to the homogeneous model.
Both the stochastic and homogeneous models are driven by
empirical mobility data; however, the compulsory lockdown
(starting on March 19th) resulted in a drastic drop of both local and inter-regional mobility. We asked whether such overall
change in mobility sufficed to explain the goodness of fit of our
models, or whether the finer structure of the mixing matrix and
the local mobility estimates also played a significant role. For
this purpose, we compared the results against a null model obtained from repeating the above presented simulations across
1000 independent realizations, randomly scrambling the ordering of the regions in the mixing matrix Mi, j and in the infection
rate vector βi . Note that both variables were scrambled only
once per simulation, i.e., not once per time step. Finally, we

number of cases in a situation where the number of infectious
individuals varied significantly from district to district.
As in the introduction section, we conclude this work with a
word of caution. We remind the reader again that simple epidemiological models, even when fed with data stemming from
population census and detailed cell phone mobility estimates,
are limited in what they can tell us. These limitations arise both
from inefficiencies at the core of these models, as well as from
shortcomings of the available data. Making these models more
complex does not necessarily improve their forecasting capabilities, specially in a situation in which solutions (and small
differences) grow, in some cases, exponentially in time. As a
result, these models should only be considered as ways of exploring possible solutions of the system, and extreme caution
should be exercised whenever these models are used to generate advice in the process of public policy decision making.
