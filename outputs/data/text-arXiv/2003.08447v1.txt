Abstract
The fast and untraceable virus mutations take lives of thousands of people before the immune system
can produce the inhibitory antibody. Recent outbreak of novel coronavirus infected and killed
thousands of people in the world. Rapid methods in finding peptides or antibody sequences that can
inhibit the viral epitopes of COVID-19 will save the life of thousands. In this paper, we devised a
machine learning (ML) model to predict the possible inhibitory synthetic antibodies for Corona virus.
We collected 1933 virus-antibody sequences and their clinical patient neutralization response and
trained an ML model to predict the antibody response. Using graph featurization with variety of ML
methods, we screened thousands of hypothetical antibody sequences and found 8 stable antibodies
that potentially inhibit COVID-19. We combined bioinformatics, structural biology, and Molecular
Dynamics (MD) simulations to verify the stability of the candidate antibodies that can inhibit the
Corona virus.

Introduction
The biomolecular process for recognition and neutralization of viral particles is through the process
of viral antigen presentation and recruitment of appropriate B cells to synthesize the neutralizing
antibodies.1 Theoretically, this process allows the immune system to stop any viral invasion, but this
response is slow and often requires days, even weeks before adequate immune response can be
achieved.2,3 This poses a challenging question: Can the process of antibody discovery be accelerated
to counter highly infective viral diseases?
With the rapid expansion of available biological data, such as DNA/protein sequences and structures4,
it is now possible to model and predict the complex biological phenomena through machine learning
(ML) approaches. Given sufficient training data, ML can be used to learn a mapping between the
viral epitope and effectiveness of its complementary antibody.5 Once such mapping is learnt, it can
be used to predict potentially neutralizing antibody for a given viral sequence6.
ML can essentially learn the complex antigen-antibody interactions faster than human immune
system, leading to the generation of synthetic inhibitory antibodies acting as a bridge, which can
overcome the latency between viral infection and human immune system response. This bridge can
potentially save the life of many especially during an outbreak and pandemic. One such instance is
the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19)7.
With incredibly high infectivity and mortality rate, COVID-19 has become a global scare.8,9 To
compound the problem, there are no proven therapeutics to aid the suffering patients2,8,10–14. Only
viable treatment at the moment is symptomatic and there is a desperate need for developing
therapeutics to counter COVID-19. Recently, the proteomics sequences of ‘WH-Human 1’
coronavirus became available through Metagenomic RNA sequencing of a patient in Wuhan.4,15 WH2

Human 1 is 89.1% similar to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses.4 With this sequence available, it
is possible to find potential inhibitory antibodies by scanning thousands of antibody sequences and
discovering the neutralizing ones16–18. However, this requires very expensive and time-consuming
experimentation to discover the inhibitory responses to Corona virus in a timely manner. In addition,
computational and physics-based models require the bound crystal structure of antibody-antigen
complex, however; only a few of these structures have become available.19,20,21,22 In the case of
COVID-19, the bound antigen-antibody crystal structure is not available to-date23,24. Given this
challenge and the fact that ML models require a large amount of data, the ML approach should rely
on the sequences of the antibody-antigen rather than the crystal structures25.
In this paper, we have collected a dataset comprised of antibody-antigen sequences of variety of
viruses including HIV, Influenza, Dengue, SARS, Ebola, Hepatitis, etc. with their patient
clinical/biochemical IC50 data. Using this dataset (we call it VirusNet), we trained and benchmarked
different shallow and deep ML models and selected the best performing model. Based on SARS 2006
neutralizing antibody scaffold26, we created thousands of potential antibody candidates by mutation
and screened them with our best performing ML model. Finally, molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations were performed on the neutralizing candidates to check their structural stability. We
predict 8 structures that were stable over the course of simulation and are potential neutralizing
antibodies for COVID-19.
In addition, we interpreted the ML method to understand what alterations in the sequence of binding
region of the antibody would most effectively counter the viral mutation(s) and restore the ability of
the antibody to bind to the virus27. This information is critical in terms of antibody design and
engineering and reducing the dimension of combinatoric mutations needed to find a neutralizing
antibody.

Methods
1. Dataset
The majority of the data in the training set is composed of HIV antibody-antigen complex (1887
samples). Most of the samples for the HIV training set were obtained from the Compile, Analyze
and Tally NAb panels (CATNAP) database from the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)
28,29

. From CATNAP, data was collected for monoclonal antibodies, 2F5, 4E10 and 10E8, which

bind with GP4130–32. Using CATNAP’s functionality for identifying epitope alignment, we selected
FASTA sequence of the antigen corresponding to the site of alignment, in the antibody. We
generated a dataset with 1831 training examples comprising of antibodies – antigen sequences and
their corresponding IC50 values. The CATNAP output is comprised of site of antigen sequence
alignment for each of the antibodies with respect to 2F5, 4E10 and 10E8. Using the co-crystalized
structure of (2F5-ELDKWAS) in (PDB:1TJG)30 as template, the antibody fragment that comes in
contact with the antigen was found by considering amino acids within 7Å of the antigen in the cocrystallized structure.
To make the dataset more diverse and train a more robust ML model, we included more available
antibody-antigen sequences and their neutralization potential. To do this, we compiled the sequences
of Influenza, Dengue, Ebola, SARS, Hepatitis, etc.26,33–86 by searching the keywords of “virus,
antibody” on RCSB server87 and selected the neutralizing complex by reading their corresponding
publications. Furthermore, for each neutralizing complex, the contact residues at the interface of
antibody and antigen were selected. To select the antigen contact sequences, all amino acids within
5Å of corresponding antibody were chosen. (Supporting Information) To select the antibody contact
sequences, all amino acids within 5Å of the antigen were chosen. In total, 102 sequences of
antibody-antigen complexes were mined and added to the 1831 samples, resulting in total number
of 1933 training samples.

2. Graph Featurization and Machine Learning
For effective representation of molecular structure of amino acids, the individual atoms of amino
acids of antibody and antigen were treated as undirected graph, where the atoms are nodes and bonds
are edges88. It has been shown that graph representation is better in transferring the chemistry and
topology of molecular structure compared to Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFP)88,89. We
construct these molecular graphs using RDkit90. Embeddings are generated to encode relevant
features about the molecular graph91,92. These embeddings encode information like the type of atom,
valency of an atom, hybridization state, aromaticity etc. First, each antibody and antigen were
encoded into separate embeddings and then concatenated into a single embedding for the entire
antibody-antigen complex. We then apply mean pooling over the features for this concatenated
embedding to ensure dimensional consistency across the training data. The pooled information is
then passed to classifier algorithms like XGBoost93, Random Forest94, Multilayer perceptron,
Support Vector Machine (SVM)95 and Logistic Regression which then predict whether the antibody
is capable of neutralizing the virus.

3. Hypothetical Antibody Library Generation
In order to find potential antibody candidates for COVID-19, 2589 different mutant strains of
antibody sequences were generated based on the sequence of SARS neutralizing antibodies. The
reason we selected these antibodies as initial scaffolds is that the genome of COVID-19 4 is 79.8%
identical to “Tor2” isolate of SARS (Accession number: AY274119)96. Using 4 different antibody
variants of SARS (PDB: 2GHW, 3BGF, 6NB6, 2DD8)26,76,81,86, point mutations were applied to all
5

the amino acids in the binding region of antibody. (see Supporting Information for COVID-19
antigen and antibody interactions) To find out the binding region of these antibodies for sequence
generation, all amino acids within 5Å of their respective antigen were chosen. To assess the
biological feasibility of these mutant sequences, we scored each mutation by using the BLOSUM62
matrix97.

4. Molecular Dynamics Simulations
To assess the stability of proposed antibody structures, we performed molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations of each of antibody structure in a solvated environment98. The simulation of solvated
antibody was carried out using GROMACS-5.1.499–101, and topologies for each antibody were
generated according the GROMOS 54a7102 forcefield. The protein was centered in a box, extending
1 nanometer from surface of the protein. This box was the solvated by the SPC216 model water
atoms, pre-equilibrated at 300K. The antibody system in general carried a net positive charge and it
was neutralized by the counter ions. Energy minimization was carried out using steepest descent
algorithm, while restraining the peptide backbone to remove the steric clashes in atoms and
subsequently optimize solvent molecule geometry. The cut-off distance criteria for this minimization
were forces less than 100.0 kJ/mol/nm or number of steps exceeding 50,000. This minimized structure
was the sent to two rounds of equilibration at 300K. First, an NVT ensemble for 50 picoseconds and
a 2-femtosecond time step. Leapfrog dynamics integrator was used with Verlet scheme, neighbor-list
was updated every 10 steps. All the ensembles were under Periodic Boundary Conditions and
harmonic constraints were applied by the LINCS algorithm103; under this scheme the long-range
electrostatic interactions were computed by Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm104. Berendsen
thermostat was used for temperature coupling and pressure coupling was done using the Parrinello6

Rahman barostat105,106. The last round of NPT simulation ensures that the simulated system is at
physiological temperature and pressure. The system volume was free to change in the NPT ensemble
but in fact did not change significantly during the course of the simulation. Following the rounds of
equilibration, production run for the system was carried out in NPT and no constraints for a total of
15 nanoseconds, under identical simulation parameters.

Results and Discussions
The flowchart of COVID-19 antibody discovery using ML has four major steps (Figure 1): 1.
Collecting data and curating the dataset for training set. 2. Featurization, embedding and
benchmarking ML models and selecting the best performing one. 3. Hypothetical antibody library
generation and ML screening for neutralization and 4. Checking the stability of proposed antibodies.
This workflow enables the rapid screening of large space of potential antibodies to neutralize COVID19. In general, this workflow can be used for high throughput screening of antibodies for any type of
virus by only knowing the sequences of antigen epitopes.
To better understand the diversity and similarity of the sequences that were used in the training set,
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) of all different viruses were computed (Figure
2a). t-SNE axes shows the directions of the maximum variance in the dataset, therefore, the
dimensionality of the data can be reduced to lower dimensions (here two). HIV antigen shows the
most variations on t-SNE components where viruses such as Influenza, Dengue and H1N1 are very
close to each other. The neutralizing antibodies were also projected using t-SNE to show the
variations in the available neutralizing sequences. (Figure 2b) Unlike antigen variations, antibody
sequences are much closer to the center of t-SNE with a few scattered ones. The comparison of Figure
2a and Figure 2b shows that the neutralizing antibodies are not sequence-diverse compared to virus
antigens. This difference demonstrates that a large space of potential antibodies can be screened and
7

used for finding novel antibodies. The labels in the dataset are comprised of the neutralization panel
data, IC50 values for monoclonal antibodies and pseudo-typed viruses. (Figure 2c) The IC50 labels
were collected from 49 published neutralization studies and were collected from Los Alamos HIV
Database (for 1831 samples in our training set).

For some cases in CATNAP, personal

communication with the authors were made to resolve sequence name ambiguities between different
laboratories. For 102 samples of various viruses collected from RCSB server, all of them neutralize
their antigen based on biochemical assays. These samples were labeled by setting their IC50 to zero.
Since classification is performed on the training dataset, IC50 ≤10 are set to neutralizing and IC50>10
to non-neutralizing (Figure 2c). To visualize the diversity of the virus types used in the dataset other
than HIV, the distribution of 13 more viruses were presented in Figure 2d. Influenza, Dengue, SARS,
Ebola and then Hepatitis have relatively larger samples in the dataset.

To benchmark the performance of different ML models on the VirusNet dataset and select the best
performing one, XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), Multilayer perceptron (MLP), Support Vector
Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression (LR) were used (Figure 3a). The five-fold cross validation
on 80%-20% split, train, and test resulted in best accuracy for XG-Boost model. The performance
and ranking of models follow the order of XGBoost (90.57%)> RF (89.18%)>LR (81.17%)> MLP
(78.23)> SVM (75.49%). Since the training data is sparse in the case of VirusNet (See Figure 2a and
Figure 2b), XGBoost selects the sparse features input by pruning and learning the underlying sparsity
patterns. To test the robustness of the XGBoost on completely unseen virus types, for each left-out
virus type, the model was trained on all the sequences in the VirusNet except for the left-out. For
example, for Influenza, all the sequences and labels of Influenza were removed from the training set
and the trained model on the remaining dataset were tested on all the Influenzas’s sequences and
consequently the classification accuracy were reported (Figure 3b). The accuracies for the out of class
8

test is as follows: Influenza (84.61%), Dengue (100%), Ebola (75%), Hepatitis (75%), SARS (100%).
The out of class results demonstrate that our model is capable of generalizing the prediction to a
completely novel virus epitope. Since COVID-19 is completely a new virus, we can conclude that
our model prediction performance will be accurate. The fact that our model prediction is 100% for
SARS out of class test demonstrate its capability of effectively predicting the antibodies for COVID19 which is from SARS family.
Next, using the best performing model (XGBoost), all the hypothetical candidates in the library were
evaluated for neutralization. Out of all the candidates, some of them are invalid mutations screened
using BLOSUM62 matrix97 (Figure 3c). 18 final candidates are both valid mutations and can
neutralize COVID-19 with high confidence probability of 0.9895 (shown with green color in Figure
3c).
Interpretability of the ML models is very important in both explaining the underlying biological and
chemical understanding of neutralization and providing design guidelines for antibody engineering.
One of the significant advantages of ensemble methods such as XGBoost is their interpretability. By
taking advantage of this property, the important features that are giving rise to neutralization were
ranked and scored (Figure 3d). The input features to the model contains atomic level attributes such
as atom type, valency, hybridization, etc. To collectively translate the important atomic features into
important amino acid features, the scores of amino acids with unique atomic features were summed
up and ranked (Figure 3d). Some of the atomic features were common among all the amino acids
(e.g. Carbon, implicit valency, Oxygen, etc.) therefore; we ignored them. However, some of the other
features like aromaticity or having Sulfur are unique and we considered those in amino acid features.
Based on the unique features appeared in ranking, Methionine (M) is the most important one. (Figure
3d)

9

The predicted sequences from the ML model were then used to model the novel structure of
potentially neutralizing antibodies. The predicted sequences were projected onto their progenitor
antibody and the changes in amino acid sequence were modelled as follows: Simple point mutations
were introduced by modifying the target amino acid using Coot

107,108

(Crystallographic Object-

Oriented Toolkit). Coot environment allowed us to predict the stereochemical effect of each point
mutation and appropriately compensate for it. Using such an approach, we were able to accurately
model the putative structures of the antibodies. The modelled structures were then passed to MD
simulations for stability check.
To check the stability of predicted structures energetically, 20 MD simulations (18 point mutations+2
wildtype (WT)) in total were performed (Figure 4a). Structures with low Root Mean Square Deviation
(RMSD) and low contact distance are in a stable conformation, whereas structures with high RMSD
and high contact distances are in an unstable conformation. RMSD and contact distance for WT
structures have lower values, demonstrating stability, therefore; the contact distances versus RMSD
is a good indicator of the stability of a protein over the course of a simulation (Figure 4b).
Once mutation introduced in the crystallographic structure, it will cause it to deviate from WT
structure’s RMSD and contact distance. We performed simulations for all the 18 point-mutant
structures and their mean contact distance versus RMSD109,110 were computed for their respective
trajectories (Figure 4b) (see Supporting Information). Based on the two WT structures mean RMSD
and contact distances, we selected the mutations which have mean contact distance and RMSD values
less than 0.488 nm and 0.35 nm, respectively. (the shaded triangle region in Figure 4b). Candidates
with higher values of mean RMSD and contact distances are unstable and will potentially fail to
neutralize the COVID-19.
In order to be more comprehensive, we created co-mutations out of 5 stable point mutations (C3, C7,
C14, C17, C18, see Table S1 in Supporting Information for the list of all 18 candidates). This resulted
10

in 5 new structures (Co1, Co2, Co3, Co4, Co5 in Table S2) that were screened using XGBoost for
neutralization. Among all 5 co-mutations, Co5 did not neutralize. To check the stability of these 4
neutralizing co-mutations, MD simulations were performed and Co1, Co2 and Co4 were found to be
stable (Figure 4b). The list of the final 8 stable mutations and co-mutations are tabulated in Table 1
and the PDB structures are available as Supporting Information.

Conclusion
We have developed a machine learning model for high throughput screening of synthetic antibodies
to discover antibodies that potentially inhibit the COVID-19. Our approach can be widely applied to
other viruses where only the sequences of viral coat protein-antibody pairs can be obtained. The ML
models were trained on 14 different virus types and achieved over 90% fivefold test accuracy. The
out of class prediction is 100% for SARS and 84.61% for Influenza, demonstrating the power of our
model for neutralization prediction of antibodies for novel viruses like COVID-19. Using this model,
the neutralization of thousands of hypothetical antibodies was predicted, and 18 antibodies were
found to be highly efficient in neutralizing COVID-19. Using MD simulations, the stability of
predicted antibodies were checked and 8 stable antibodies were found that can neutralize COVID-19.
In addition, the interpretation of ML model revealed that mutating to Methionine and Tyrosine is
highly efficient in enhancing the affinity of antibodies to COVID-19.

Figure 1. Designing antibodies or peptide sequences that can inhibit the COVID-19 virus requires
high throughput experimentation of vastly mutated sequences of potential inhibitors. The screening
of thousands of available strains of antibodies are prohibitively expensive, and not feasible due to
lack of available structures. However, machine learning models can enable the rapid and inexpensive
exploration of vast sequence space on the computer in a fraction of seconds. We collected 1933 virusantibody sequences with clinical patient IC50 data. Graph featurization of antibody-antigen sequences
creates a unique molecular representation. Using graph representation, we benchmarked and used a
variety of shallow and deep learning models and selected XGBoost because of its superior
performance and interpretability. We trained our model using a dataset including 1,933 diverse virus
epitope and the antibodies. To generate the hypothetical antibody library, we mutated the SARS
scaffold antibody of 2006 (PDB:2GHW) and generated thousands of possible candidates. Using the
ML model, we classified these sequences and selected the top 18 sequences that will neutralize
COVID-19 with high confidence. We used MD simulations to check the stability of the 18 sequences
and rank them based on their stability.

Supplementary Figure 1. Contact Distance plot of trajectories of all the 22 mutant structures and
the crystal structures 2GHW and 6NB6. The contact distances were computed using MDTraj
package. Instantaneous contact distances for each timestep are shown for the course of the simulation
(15 ns). The contact distance values vary within a small range for all the structures, indicating that
simulations did not have any abrupt changes.

structures and the crystal structures 2GHW and 6NB6. The deviations are within acceptable range
indicating the strucutres were stable over the course of simulation. RMSD was averaged over the
entire simultation and subsequently used for generation of Figure 4b.

Supplementary Methods
IC50 Value interpretation
The IC50 values in dataset varied from 0 to >50. For simplicity of analysis, we classified the IC50
values into two categories. Where, IC50 > 10 would indicate a non-neutralizing antibody and IC50 <
10 would indicate a neutralizing antibody. Many viruses had the same viral epitope and yet had very
different IC50 values. As a result, the model had to predict two different labels for the same antibodyantigen combinations. We resolved this, by taking a majority vote among the conflicts and
transformed the labels which do not concur with the majority. Employing this scheme improved the
results of our model.
