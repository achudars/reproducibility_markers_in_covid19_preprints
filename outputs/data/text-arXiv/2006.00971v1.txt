Abstract
Disease spread is a complex phenomenon requiring an interdisciplinary approach. Covid-19 exhibited a
global spatial spread in a very short time frame resulting in a global pandemic. Data of new Covid-19
cases per million were analysed worldwide at the spatial scale of a country and time replicated from the
end of December 2019 to late May 2020. Data driven analysis of epidemiological, economic, public
health, and governmental intervention variables was performed in order to select the optimal variables
in explaining new Covid-19 cases across all countries in time. Sequentially, hierarchical variance
partitioning of the optimal variables was performed in order to quantify the independent contribution of
each variable in the total variance of new Covid-19 cases per million. Results indicated that from the
variables available new tests per thousand explained the vast majority of the total variance in new cases
(51.6%) followed by the governmental stringency index (15.2%). Availability of hospital beds per 100k
inhabitants explained 9% extreme poverty explained 8.8%, hand washing facilities 5.3%, the fraction of
the population aged 65 or older explained 3.9%, and other disease prevalence (cardiovascular diseases
plus diabetes) explained 2.9%. The percentage of smokers within the population explained 2.6% of the
total variance, while population density explained 0.6%.

Introduction
Patterns of infectious diseases across spatial and temporal scales are fundamental for
understanding their dynamics and for designing eradication strategies [1, 2]. Disease spread is a complex
phenomenon and requires an interdisciplinary approach spanning from medicine to statistics and social
sciences [3]. Covid-19 exhibited a global spatial spread in a relatively very short time frame resulting in
being characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation [4].
To date there is no known anti-viral treatment or vaccine against Covid-19 [5]. Therefore the
available options against the virus are the characteristics of the immune system and health status of
each individual, the health system of the country that the individual has access to, the social behaviour
of the other individuals forming the society, public interventions of movement or public campaigns, and
testing [6-8]. Thus, there are relatively few options to be employed in order to diminish the spread of
the disease. This scarcity of options makes quantifying the factors associated with disease spread more
important and ranking the relative contribution of each factor on Covid-19 spread may facilitate
diminishing it [9].
Analysis so far has often been dominated either on a one-at-a-time factor analysis (e.g. new
cases per testing effort or total cases per age structure) or on a country basis analysis (e.g doubling time
in one country in comparison to other countries). While such comparisons are straightforward and
comprehensive, from a statistical perspective they are examining one factor at a time and masking
underlying characteristics within countries under a variable ‘Country’ [10]. This results in a hidden
burden of the underlying factors regarding disease spread and causality is often discussed in a
speculative manner. Admittedly the problem is complex due to the large differences across the potential
underlying factors across countries. A small variance implies that the mean contains virtually all of
the information, while a large variance implies that more information than the mean is present [11].
When examining several countries together and across time, quantifying the variance may be more
informative than the mean [12]. Variance is introduced both by space, there are large e.g. climatic
differences between locations on the same date, as well as by temporal e.g. climatic or behavioural
changes within locations in seasons [13-15].
The potential effect of economic, epidemiological and public health, or governmental
interventions may become clearer when the contribution of these factors into new Covid-19 cases are
analysed accounting for the fact that they derive from different countries as well as in different time
snapshots [16] but in a way that the effect of each factor can be quantified in conjunction with the
effects of other factors. To that end methods that can account for both spatial and temporal
autocorrelation [17] in the data of new Covid-19 cases but can quantify the effect of each
epidemiological, economic, public health, and governmental intervention are key to our understanding
of how the disease spreads in populations worldwide [18, 19].
In this study spatio-temporal worldwide data of new Covid-19 cases form the “Our world in
data” database [20] were analyzed using computational statistics. The spatial replicate of the dataset
included over 150 countries time replicated for each country across a period of ≈five months. Data
driven analysis was performed in order to quantify the optimal variables in cases where several
candidate variables were available. During the data driven variable selection, the fact that data derived
from different countries and were time replicated was accounted for by nesting the variance of time
within the variance of country and treated as random effects [21, 22]. The percentage of the total
variance explained by each epidemiological, economic, public health, and governmental intervention
variables associated with Covid-19 new cases was quantified using hierarchical variance partitioning [23,

24] thereby ranking the relative contribution of the variance of each factor on new Covid-19 cases
worldwide.
Methods
Data
The objective was to quantify epidemiological, public health, economic, and governmental
intervention factors associated with Covid-19 spread worldwide. New Covid-19 cases per million per
country per time step were used a proxy of disease spread. New cases per million in each country was
chosen instead of new cases per country as this estimator is less biased by the total population of each
country - countries with higher populations are more likely to produce higher new cases or total but the
number may be relatively low in comparison to the total population pool. Data regarding new Covid-19
cases per million from the “Our world in data” database were analyzed. The dataset was last accessed
on 25/05/2020 and the download location is https://github.com/owid/covid-19data/tree/master/public/data. The data derive from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Control (ECDC), an EU agency with the aim to strengthen Europe’s defense against infectious diseases.
The ECDC collects and aggregates data from countries around the world. The most up-to-date data for
any particular country is therefore typically available earlier via the national health agencies than via the
ECDC. This lag between nationally available data and the ECDC data is not very long as the ECDC
publishes new data daily; typically this time lag is at the level of some hours and less than a day. The
ECDC collects compiles and harmonizes data from around the world in a consistent way which allows us
to compare what is happening in different countries. The spatial replicate of the dataset comprised of
160 countries while the temporal replicate spans from 31/12/2019 to (including) 25/05/2020. The
variables included:

In particular regarding the governmental stringency index [25], the methodology is explained
here:
https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/codebook.md

and here:
https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/index_methodology.md

From the available variables male and female smokers were averaged as ‘smokers’.
Data analytics
We employed generalised linear mixed effects models (LME; [26]) with new Covid-19 cases per
million as the dependent variable. As the dataset contained several potential indexes of testing,
population density, or age structure within each country, initial analysis was conducted in order to select
the most informative index of each.

We initially sought to quantify the most parsimonious data driven index of testing which
included the fixed effects of (i) news tests (ii) total tests (iii) new tests per thousand (iv) total tests per
thousand (v) new tests smoothed, (vi) new tests smoothed per thousand. This was achieved by fitting six
LMEs with new cases per million as the dependent variable and six LMEs with i - vi as the single
independent variable. The random effect structure of each LME included the nested variance of time
within each country (Random~Country/Time). Doing so the fitted LMEs accounted for both temporal
and spatial autocorrelation in the time replicated data deriving from different geographic locations [21,
22]. LMEs were fitted with Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation to allow comparisons between models
with different fixed effects and selecting the LME that exhibited the lowest Akaike (AIC) value [27, 28].
Here and throughout the analysis, there were 19,709 data points in the analysis but there were variables
with missing values at some time steps or at some countries. Missing values were omitted from the
statistical analysis. Therefore AIC values are compared between models fitted with different fixed
effects but also with potentially different sample sizes.
Similarly, LMEs with new cases per million as the dependent variable and the fixed effects of (i)
population or (ii) population density, and the nested random effects of time within country were fitted
with ML and compared against AIC values to select the optimal data driven population index.
Regarding age structure of the population within each country, the available variables were (i)
median age of the population, (ii) the percentage of the population aged 65 or older, and (iii) the
percentage of the population aged 70 or older. The analysis proceeded by selecting the ML fitted LME
with the lowest AIC between the three available age population structure variables. All three fitted LMEs
contained the random effects of time nested within country.
Regarding economic status of the population within each country, the available variables were
(i) gdp per capita, and (ii) percentage of the population under extreme poverty. The analysis proceeded
by selecting the ML fitted LME with the lowest AIC between the two available economy status variables.
The two fitted LMEs contained the random effects of time nested within country.
Having selected the optimal index of testing, population density and age structures the analysis
proceeded with the following variables: (1) population density, (2) new tests per thousand, (3)
governmental stringency index, (4) percentage of the population aged > 65, (5) percentage of the
population under extreme poverty, (6) cvd death rate, (7) diabetes prevalence, (8) percentage of
smokers, (9) percentage of the population with access to hand washing facilities, and (10) hospital beds
per 100k inhabitants within each country as independent variables.
Hierarchical Variance Partitioning (HVP) statistical modelling was implemented to account for
the contribution of each data driven epidemiological, economic, public health, and governmental
intervention explanatory variable to the total variance of new Covid-19 per million cases [29, 30]. HVP is
a statistical framework that is capable of handling correlated independent variables, whilst providing a
reliable ranking of predictor importance of each variable [29]. Variance partitioning is calculated from
the Akaike (AIC) weights of each explanatory variable and it is based upon the number of times that a
variable was significant in all possible combinations of the explanatory variables. The HVP function
produces a minor rounding error for hierarchies constructed from more than nine variables [31] - the
available data driven variables were 10. To check if this error affects the inference from an analysis, the
analysis was repeated several times with the variables entered in a different order [31]. The analysis
resulted in changes in the derived results when the order of the variables was changed. The analysis
proceeded by creating a new variable that merged together other disease related variables: other
diseases variable= (cvd_death_rate + diabetes_prevalence) plus the other remaining eight variables

resulting in a total of nine variables. There is no known statistical bias in HVP when 9 or fewer variables
are used [31].
Results
The optimal data driven index for explaining new cases per million from the ones available
regarding testing was new cases per thousand as fitted by LMEs and selected against the lowest AIC
value (Table 2a). New tests per thousand smoothed could not be fitted as the LME did not converge
(Table 2a). The optimal data driven population index for new cases per million was population density
(Table 2b). The optimal data driven index for age structure within the population was the percentage of
the population within each country aged 65 or older (Table 2c). The optimal AIC selected LME regarding
the economic status of the population within each country in relation to new Covid-19 cases per million
was extreme poverty (Table 2d).
INSERT TABLE 2
Results from HVP indicated that total tests per thousand explained 51.6% of the total variance
of new cases per million, while governmental stringency index explained 15.2% (Fig. 1, Table 3).
Availability of hospital bed per 100k inhabitants explained 9% (Fig. 1, Table 3). Extreme poverty
explained 8.8% of the total variance of new cases per million, hand washing facilities 5.3%, the fraction
of the population aged 65 or older explained 3.9%, other disease prevalence (cardiovascular diseases
plus diabetes) explained 2.9% (Fig. 1, Table 3). The percentage of smokers within the population
explained 2.6% of the total variance of new Covid-19 cases per million, while population density
explained 0.6% (Fig. 1, Table 3).
Discussion
The best model fit regarding new Covid-19 cases per million and the economic status of the
country where the new cases are recorded indicated that extreme poverty was a better predictor of
new cases than gdp per capita. It is thus the poorest individuals within each country impacted rather
than poor countries. From the data available, the fraction of the population aged 65 or older explained
optimally new cases per million and not median population age. Total tests per thousand and not new
tests or new tests smoothed or other available indexes is a better predictor of new cases per million,
perhaps unsurprisingly as the number of new cases is already normalized by the population and thus the
number of tests also normalized by the population explains better the pattern. The latter also applies for
population density instead of total population as the best available predictor of new cases per million.
Summing up, from the data-driven analysis it is evident that new Covid-19 cases per million are best
explained by extreme poverty prevalence within each country as well as by the fraction of the
population older than 65, thereby indicating association of the spread of the disease with the poor and
older.
Results from variance partitioning of the data-driven selected 9 epidemiological, public health,
economic, and governmental intervention variables explaining Covid-19 new cases per million across
countries through time, indicated that the vast majority of new cases per million are explained by the
number of tests conducted. The number of new tests per thousand explains over 50% of the total
variance through time and countries and thus the message regarding the efficacy of testing against
Covid-19 spread is strong, at least form the results derived here. The efficacy of testing has been
highlighted as the best strategy against other diseases too across humans, agriculture, and wildlife [1,
24, 32, 33]. It therefore seems that the optimal strategies against Covid-19 spread should include high
number of tests both to suspicious cases as well as random population testing.

Would increasing the number of tests result in detecting more Covid-19 cases? Lost Covid-19
cases are not uncommon [34, 35]. From a statistical perspective, variance partitioning does not provide
information on the sign of the effects (positive or negative) it simply shows in how many cases this
variable could not be excluded from the final optimal statistical model in explaining new Covid-19 cases.
The slope between new tests per thousand inhabitants and new cases per million vary between
countries (Fig. 2a). Indeed there are countries where the slope between new cases per million and new
tests per thousand are positive indicating that testing more would actually result into identifying more
cases (Fig. 2a); [32]. However, there are also countries with a negative slope between new tests – new
cases’ indicating that testing frequency is saturated (Fig. 2a). Overall, using data from all countries and
time steps, the relationship between testing and new cases is positive indicating that worldwide more
tests would result in identifying higher number of new cases (Fig. 2b). Therefore the efficacy of testing
has not been saturated.
The second best variable in explaining new Covid-19 cases per million was the governmental
stringency index. The governmental stringency index contains several measures taken by governments
including school closures, national and international movement restrictions, public gathering and public
events restrictions, exiting home restrictions as well as testing policies and financial measures [25]. To
that end testing policy is in part contained in the stringency index as a weighted percentage of the
overall index. However the relationship between stringency index and new tests per thousand is very
weak with both R2 and slope close to zero: linear regression (new_tests_per_thousand) = 0.1959 +
0.002479 (stringency_index), S = 0.597, R2 = 1.1%, P<0.001. Therefore of the available governmental
measures summarized in the stringency index, testing frequency can be treated independently.
In general, countries increased their level of stringency as their number of confirmed COVID-19
cases raised, however there is significant variation in the rate and timing of this relationship [25].
Another study indicated that in the early and accelerating stages of the pandemic, many citizens across
58 countries viewed their governments’ response as insufficient [36]. In general the status of the
infection spread and policy implementation influence restrictions uniformly across every countries [37].
Given the overall large effect of testing on new cases, it has been investigated whether there exists a
testing frequency for Covid-19 such that the shutdown could have been avoided [38]. The study
concluded that indeed there is an optimal testing frequency such that lockdown and thus governmental
stringency may not be deemed necessary [38]. The test against Covid-19 is known to be imperfect but
not precisely known [39] and testing strategies to surmount this problem have been proposed [40].
The availability of hospital beds per 100k inhabitants, hand washing facilities, the effect of
Covid-19 in the older people as well as prevalence of other diseases and smokers have been highlighted
[19, 41, 42] and this study confirms their importance. Environmental factors have also been reported to
play an important role in Covid-19 dynamics [43] however this study did not explore their relative
contribution.

Figure 2. a. Linear regression between new Covid-19 cases per million and new Covid-19 tests per
thousand per country across all time steps. Both variables were log(x+1) transformed before regression
in this graph. Each line indicates the slope of the regression between new cases and new tests on each
country. b. Linear regression between new Covid-19 cases per million and new Covid-19 tests per
thousand across all countries and time step (all data). Both variables were log(x+1) transformed before
regression in this graph. The solid red line indicates the regression, dashed green lines indicate the 95%
confidence interval, and dotted red lines the 95% prediction interval. The regression equation is
log(new_cases_per_million+1) = 0.4777 + 2.725 log(new_tests_per_thousand+1). S = 0.530, R2 = 33.5%,
P<0.001.
