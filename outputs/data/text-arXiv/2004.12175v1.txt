Abstract
We investigated the dependence of Covid-19 attack rates on demographic and socioeconomic factors for the communities in Suffolk County (Long Island, New York State), presently
the 5th most-affected county in the United States. Confirming the previous observations that
minorities are disproportionately impacted by the Covid-19 disease, we found that the attack
rate is strongly correlated with the minority population proportion, with an alarmingly high
∼ 4-fold attack rate increase for Black and Hispanic populations.

Introduction.

The Covid-19 disease first emerged in late 2019 and has since risen to a global health crisis and was
declared a pandemic on March 11th, 2020. Covid-19 is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is transmitted from person to person in close
contact by small respiratory droplets. As of April 28, 2020, this highly contagious disease has
infected more than 2 million people and has caused over 150 thousand deaths in more than 200
countries.
Socioeconomic and racial/ethnic inequities frequently affect health and healthcare access, resulting in a higher burden of disease and mortality in vulnerable social groups [1–4]. Previous
studies showed that multiple diseases, both non-infectious (e.g. cardiovascular diseases, cancer,
obesity, diabetes) and infectious (influenza, tuberculosis, pneumonia), have a higher incidence
rates in the minority populations [5–10].
There have been multiple reports of significant impacts of racial/ethnic disparities on the severity of Covid-19. For instance, the CDC COVID-NET survey of 580 hospitalized Covid-19 patients
from 14 US states [11] found that 33% of the patients were African Americans, which is significantly higher than the percentage of African Americans (18%) in the COVID-NET catchment
population. In New York City, African Americans account for 28% of all fatalities while accounting for 22% of the total population, and Hispanic Americans account for 34% of the total cases
while accounting for 29% of the population [12] .
Measuring the effects of socioeconomic and racial disparities can help inform the public and
policymakers about at-risk populations, resulting in a more efficient allocation of resources and

personnel to effectively mitigate the spread of Covid-19. It could also benefit the most affected
communities by increasing their awareness of the Covid-19 dangers and preventative measures.
In this work, we investigated the dependence of Covid-19 attack rate on racial/ethnic composition and several socioeconomic metrics for the communities in Suffolk County (Long Island,
New York state), presently the 5th most affected county in the United States. We found that the
attack rate is strongly correlated with the minority population percentage, confirming the previous
observation that minorities are much stronger affected by the Covid-19 disease.

Methods.

We have collected the Covid-19 attack rate data on the Suffolk county Department of Health
Services interactive web-map on April 10-11 [13]. The attack rate is defined as the total number of positive cases in a community (at the collection time) divided by the total population of
the community. Next, we collected demographic and economic data for each community from
the censusreporter.org website [14]. This information was sourced from the 2014-2018 American
Community Survey [15]. The following metrics were considered: proportions of White, Black,
Hispanic and Asian residents, median age, per capita income, median household income, proportion of persons below poverty level, mean travel time to work. We restricted our analyses
to the 128 communities with populations greater than 1,000 persons. We utilized standard
statistical and plotting functions in Matlab; confidence intervals for all estimates were calculated by bootstrapping with 10,000 samples. The data table and code are available on GitHub:

Results.

In Figure 1 we plotted the Covid-19 attack rate vs. the minority population percentage in each
community. Attack rate correlates strongly with the minority population proportion: Pearson
correlation coefficient R = 0.61, 95% confidence interval [0.41, 0.75]. Performing the linear leastsquares fit to the data, we estimate that the attack rate for the minorities is 4.1 times higher
than that for the whites (95% confidence interval [2.6, 6.1]). We note that this ratio is higher than
ratios that can be derived from the previous reports of rascal/ethnic composition of fatalities in
New York City (28% + 34%)/(22% + 29%) ≈ 1.2 [12] and hospitalized patients across the US
33%/18% ≈ 1.8 [11].
In Figure 2A we plotted Covid-19 attack rate vs. per capita income. We observe that lowincome communities have higher attack rates than high-income communities. However, as shown
in figure 2B, the per capita income is itself strongly anti-correlated with the minority population
proportion. For communities with minority population < 20%, we found no significant correlation
between attack rate and per capita income: R = 0.14, 95% confidence interval [−0.06, 0.45].
The multicollinearity is also present for other demographic and economic predictor variables
in our study. Figure 3A shows pairwise correlation coefficients between the predictor variables,
as well as attack rate and predictor variables. We see a strong negative correlation of minority
population percentage with per capita income, mean household income, and age, and a positive
correlation with proportion of persons below the poverty line, and the same trends are observed in
the dependence of attack rate on these predictors. Figure 3B shows that the minority population
proportion has the highest absolute correlation with the attack rate. The attack rates are cor2

related with Black and Hispanic population proportions equally strongly. The Asian population
proportion and travel time to work do not correlate significantly with the attack rate, though this
may be owing to the narrow range of these variables in the communities under study. We also investigated multilinear regression of the attack rates with all pairs of predictor variables, and found
that none of them increased the correlation statistically significantly, which indicates that our
study is not powered to discern separate contributions of these demographic and socioeconomic
variables.

Discussion.

In this study, we investigated the dependence of the Covid-19 attack rate on the several demographic and economic factors in the Suffolk County communities. Among all the variables, the
percentage of the minority population in a community was the best predictor of Covid-19 attack
rate. Unlike other approaches, which utilize the demographics of the infected patients, our study
estimates the attack rate dependence on race/ethnicity by correlating it with the racial/ethnic
composition of communities. While the former approaches are more direct, our approach is more
informative for assessing hardships and disparities affecting the minority communities.
Our work does not utilize any genetic information and hence does not point to any genetic
basis in the racial/ethnic disparities of the Covid-19 infection. The racial/ethnic and socioeconomic
inequities have been widely documented for other diseases and are attributed to a multitude of
health and environmental causes, such as limited access to healthcare, lack of health insurance, preexisting conditions, substandard housing, and hazardous work. In the case of Covid-19 pandemic,
these hardships are further exacerbated by the higher economic stress for minority communities
resulting in diminished capacity for social distancing which is imperative to suppress the spread
of the novel coronavirus. In addition, minorities constitute a large proportion of essential workers,
further increasing their exposure to Covid-19 infection.
Our main finding is that the Covid-19 attack rate for Black and Hispanic populations is alarmingly (4.1-fold) higher than that for the White population. In line with previous observations, this
indicates that the minorities are affected the greatest by Covid-19, and thus minority communities
require the most assistance in order to lessen the distress caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. We
notice that the New York State and Suffolk County governments have begun taking first steps
to address this crisis. The new Covid-19 testing sites have been opened on April 8-16 in minority communities that are Covid-19 hot spots: Brentwood (3-fold higher attack rate than Suffolk
County average), Huntington Station (2.4-fold), Wyandanch (2.8-fold). We hope that our study
will increase public and government awareness of the severity of the Covid-19 impact on minorities, and result in more decisive actions taken to protect the minority communities in the United
States and around the world.
