COVID-19 has forced quarantine measures in several countries across the world. These
measures have proven to be effective in significantly reducing the prevalence of the virus.
To date, no effective treatment or vaccine is available. In the effort of preserving both
public health as well as the economical and social textures, France and Italy governments
have partially released lockdown measures. Here we extrapolate the long-term behavior of
the epidemics in both countries using a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR)
model where parameters are stochastically perturbed to handle the uncertainty in the estimates of COVID-19 prevalence. Our results suggest that uncertainties in both parameters
and initial conditions rapidly propagate in the model and can result in different outcomes
of the epidemics leading or not to a second wave of infections. Using actual knowledge,
asymptotic estimates of COVID-19 prevalence can fluctuate of order of ten millions units
in both countries.

LEAD PARAGRAPH
COVID-19 pandemic poses serious threats to public health as well as economic and so-

cial stability of many countries. A real time extrapolation of the evolution of COVID-19
epidemics is challenging both for the nonlinearities undermining the dynamics and the ignorance of the initial conditions, i.e., the number of actual infected individuals. Here we
focus on France and Italy, which have partially released initial lockdown measures. The
goal is to explore sensitivity of COVID-19 epidemic evolution to the release of lockdown
measures using dynamical (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) stochastic models. We
show that the large uncertainties arising from both poor data quality and inadequate estimations of model parameters (incubation, infection and recovery rates) propagate to long term
extrapolations of infections counts. Nonetheless, distinct scenarios can be clearly identified,
showing either a second wave or a quasi-linear increase of total infections.

INTRODUCTION
SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus of the coronavirus family1 emerged in Wuhan (China) at the

end of 20192 and rapidly propagated across the world until it has been declared a pandemic by
the World Health Organization on March 11, 20203 . SARS-CoV-2 virus provokes an infectious
disease known as COVID-19 that has an incredibly large spectrum of symptoms or none depending
on the age, health status and the immune defenses of each individuals4 . SARS-CoV-2 causes
potentially life-threatening form of pneumonia and/or cardiac injuries in a non-negligible patients
fraction5,6 .
To date, no treatment of vaccine is available for COVID-197 . Efforts to contain the virus and
to not overwhelm intensive care facilities are based on quarantine measures which have proven
very effective in several countries8–10 . Despite this, lockdown measures entail enormous economical, social and psychological costs. Recent estimates of the International Monetary Fund recently
announced a global recession that will drag global GDP lower by 3% in 2020, although continuously developing and changing as well as significantly depending country-by-country11 . More
than 20 million people have lost their job in United States12 and a large percentage of Italians
have developed psychological disturbances such as insomnia or anxiety due to the strict lockdown
measures13 . Those measures have been taken on the basis of epidemics models, which are fitted
2

on the available data14 . In Italy, initial lockdown measures started on February 23rd for 11 municipalities in both Lombardia and Veneto which were identified as the two main Italian clusters.
After the initial spread of the epidemics into different regions all Italian territory was placed into a
quarantine on March 9th, with total lockdown measures including all commercial activities (apart
supermarkets and pharmacies), non-essential businesses and industries, and severe restrictions to
transports and movements of people at regional, national, and extra-national levels15 . People were
asked to stay at home or near for sporting activities and dog hygiene (within 200 m from home),
to reduce as much as possible their movements (only for food shopping and care reasons), and
smart-working was especially encouraged in both public and private administrations and companies. At the early stages of epidemics intensive cares were almost saturated with a peak of 4000
people on April 3rd and a peak of hospitalisations of 30000 on April 4th, significantly reducing
after these dates, reaching 1500 and 17000, respectively, at the beginning of phase 2 on May 4th,
and 750 and 1000 on May 18th when lockdown measures on commercial activities were relaxed.
These numbers, continuously declining during the next days and weeks, confirmed the benefit of
lockdown measures16 .
Alarmed by the exponential growth of new infections and the saturation of the intensive care beds,
also France introduced strict lockdown measures on March 17th17 . The French government restricted travels to food shopping, care and work when teleworking was not possible, outings near
home for individual sporting activity and/or dog hygiene, and it imposed the closure of the Schengen area borders as well as the postponement of the second round of municipal elections. The
number of patients in intensive care, like the number of hospitalisations overall peaked in early
April and then started to decline, showing the benefits of lockdown measures. On Monday, May
11th, France began a gradual easing of COVID-19 lockdown measures18 . Trips of up to 100 kilometres from home are allowed without justification, as will gatherings of up to 10 people. Longer
trips will still be allowed only for work or for compelling family reasons, as justified by a signed
form. Guiding the government’s plans for easing the lockdown is the division of the country into
two zones, green and red, based on health indicators. Paris region (Ile de France), with about 12
milions inhabitants is flagged, to date, as an orange zone.
In both countries, the release of lockdown measures has been authorised by authorities after
consulting scientific committees which were monitoring the behavior of the curve of infections
using COVID-19 data. Those data are provided daily, following a request of the WHO. To date,
the WHO guidelines require countries to report, at each day t, the total number of infected patients
3

I(t) as well as the number of deaths D(t). Large uncertainties have been documented in the count
of I(t)19 . Whereas in the early stage of the epidemic several countries tested asymptomatic individuals to track back the infection chain, recent policies to estimate I(t) have changed. Most of
the western countries have previously tested only patients displaying severe SARS-CoV-2 symptoms20 . In an effort of tracking all the chain of infections, Italy and France are now testing all
individuals displaying COVID-19 symptoms and those who had strict contacts with infected individuals. The importance of tracking asymptomatic patients has been proven in a recent study21 .
The authors have estimated that an enormous part of total infections were undocumented (80% to
90%) and that those undetected infections were the source for 79% of documented cases in China.
Tracking strategies have proven effective in supporting actions to reduce the rate of new infections,
without the need of lockdown measures, as in South Korea22 .

The goal of this paper is to explore possible future epidemics scenarios of the long term behavior of the COVID-19 epidemic23 but taking into account the role of uncertainties in both the parameters value and the infection counts to investigate different outcomes of the epidemics leading
or not to a second wave of infections. To this purpose we use a stochastic Susceptible-ExposedInfected-Recovered (SEIR) model24 which consist in a set of ordinary differential equations where
control parameters are time-dependent modelled via a stochastic process. This allows to mimic the
dependence on control parameters on some additional/external factors as super-spreaders25 and the
enforcing/relaxing of confinement measures24 . As for the classical SEIR models26 the population
is divided into four compartmental groups, i.e., Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered
individuals. The stochastic SEIR model shows that long-term extrapolation is sensitive to both the
initial conditions and the value of control parameters24 , with asymptotic estimates fluctuating on
the order of ten millions units in both countries, leading or not a second wave of infections. This
sensitivity arising from both poor data quality and inadequate estimations of model parameters
has been also recently investigated by means of a statistical model based on a generalized logistic
distribution27 . The paper is organised as follows: in Section III we discuss the various sources
of data for COVID-19 and their shortcomings, and then we discuss in detail the SEIR model and
its statistical modelling. In Section IV we discuss the results focusing on the statistical sensitivity
of the modelling, and apply it to data from France and Italy. We finish, in Section V, with some
remarks and point out some limitiations of our study.

DATA AND MODELLING
Data

This paper relies on data stored into the Visual Dashboard repository of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) supported by ESRI Living Atlas
Team and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (JHU APL). Data can be freely
accessed and downloaded at https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/,
and refers to the confirmed cases by means of a laboratory test3 . Nevertheless there are some
inconsistencies between countries due to different protocols in testing patients (suspected symptoms, tracing-back procedures, wide range tests)28,29 , as well as, to local management of health
infrastructures and institutions. As an example due to the regional-level system of Italian healthcare data are collected at a regional level and then reported to the National level via the Protezione
Civile transferring them to WHO. These processes could be affected by some inconsistencies and
delays30 , especially during the most critical phase of the epidemic diffusion that could introduce
errors and biases into the daily data. These incongruities mostly affected the period between February 23rd and March 10th, particularly regarding the counts of deaths due to a protocol change from
the Italian Ministry of Health31 . A similar situation occurs in France where the initial testing strategy was based only on detecting those individuals experiencing severe COVID19 symptoms32 .
In the post lockdown phase, France has extended its testing capacity to asymptomatic individuals
who have been in contact with infected patients33 .

B.

A Stochastic epidemiological Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model
One of the most used epidemiological models is the so-called Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-

Recovered (SEIR) model belonging to the class of compartmental models26 . It assumes that the
total population N can be divided into four classes of individuals that are susceptible S, exposed
E, infected I, and recovered or dead R (assumed to be not susceptible to reinfection). The model
is based on the following assumptions:
1. the total population does not vary in time, e.g., dN/dt = dS/dt + dE/dt + dI/dt + dR/dt =
0, ∀t ≥ 0;
2. susceptible individuals become infected that then can only recover or die, e.g., S → I → R;
5

3. exposed individuals E encountered an infected person but are not themselves infectious;
4. recovered or died individuals R are forever immune.
Thus, the model reads as
dS
dt
dE
dt
dI
dt
dR
dt

= −λ S(t)I(t),

(1)

= λ S(t)I(t) − αE(t),

(2)

= αE(t) − γI(t),

(3)

= γI(t),

(4)

where γ > 0 is the recovery/death rate, λ = λ0 /S(0) > 0 is the infection rate rescaled by the initial
number of susceptible individuals S(0), and α is the inverse of the incubation period. Its discrete
version can be simply obtained via an Euler Scheme as

S(t + 1) = S(t) − λ S(t)I(t),

(5)

E(t + 1) = (1 − α)E(t) + λ S(t)I(t),

(6)

I(t + 1) = (1 − γ)I(t) + αE(t),

(7)

R(t + 1) = R(t) + γI(t).

(8)

in which we fixed dt = 1 day that is the time resolution of COVID-19 counts. By means of γ and
λ0 the model also allows to derived the so-called R0 parameter, e.g., R0 = λ0 /γ, representing the
average reproduction number of the virus. It is related to the number of cases that can potentially
(on average) caused from an infected individual during its infectious period (τin f = γ −1 ). Early
estimates in Wuhan34 on January 2020 reported R0 = 2.682.86
2.47 which lead to γ = 0.37 fixing λ ' 1
as in35 and a 95% confidence level range for the incubation period between 2 and 11 days36 .
However, the R0 parameter as well as models parameters λ , γ, and α can vary in time during
the epidemics due to different factors as the possible presence of the so-called super-spreaders25 ,
intrinsic changes of the SARS-CoV-2 features, lockdown measures, asymptomatic individuals who
are not tracked out, counting procedures and protocols, and so on37 .
To deal with uncertainties in long-term extrapolations and with the time-dependency of control
parameters a stochastic approach could provide new insights in modeling epidemics38–40 , especially when epidemics show a wide range of spatial and temporal variability
6

41–43 .

However,

instead of investigating how to get a realistic behavior by stochastically perturbing control parameters, here we investigate how uncertainties into the final counts C(t) are controlled by model
parameters24 . Thus, we use a stochastic version of the SEIR model in which the set of control
parameters κ ∈ {α, λ , γ} is modelled via a stochastic process

κ(t) = |κ0 + σ · ξ (t)|,

(9)

with being σ the intensity of the perturbation, ξ (t) a random variable from a collection of
normally distributed N(0, 1) values at each time t, and since κ(t) ≥ 0 we introduced the absolute
value in Eq. (9). In this way we can introduce instantaneous daily discrete jumps (e.g., take
into account daily uncertainties) in the control parameters to properly model detection errors on
infection counts, appropriately described through a discrete process44 than a continuous one45 .

IV.

RESULTS

A.

Model validation: first wave
We begin this section by validating the SEIR stochastic model on the first wave of infections.

We have therefore to chose the initial conditions, and then introduce the lockdown measures in the
parameters.
a.

France

In France, the first documented case of COVID-19 infections goes back to December 27th, 2019.
Doctors at a hospital in the northern suburbs of Paris retested samples from patients between December 2nd, 2019, and January 16th, 2020. Of the 14 patient samples retested, one sample, from
a 42-year-old man came back positive46 . As initial condition for the SEIR model, we therefore set
I(t = 1) = 1 and t = 1 corresponds to December 27th, 2019. We then use R0 = 2.682.86
2.47 which
lead to γ = 0.37 fixing λ0 ' 1. Strict lockdown measures are introduced at t = 80 (i.e., March
17th, 2020). First wave modelling results are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1a) shows the modelled
value of R0 . During confinement, we let λ fluctuates by 20% of its value around 1/4. We base
this new infection rate on the mobility data for France during confinement, which have shown a
1.0 ,
drop by ∼ 75% according to the INSERM report #1147 . The resulting confinement R0 = 0.750.5

a range of values compatible with that published by the Pasteur Institute48 . The cumulative number of infections is shown in Figure 1b) and shows, on average, that 8 millions people have been
7

infected by SARS-CoV-2 in France. The uncertainty range is extremely large, according to the
error propagation given by the stochastic fluctuations of the parameters (see24 for explanations). It
extends from few hundred thousands individuals up to 18 millions. The average is however close
to the value proposed by the authors in

49 ,

who estimate a prevalence of ∼ 6% of COVID-19 in

the French population. Another realistic feature of the model is the presence of an asymmetric
behavior of the right tail of daily infections distributions (Figure 1c) that has also been observed
in real COVID-19 published data50 .
b.

Italy

For Italy, the first suspect COVID-19 case goes back to December 22nd, 2019, a 41-year-old
woman who could only be tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in April 202051 . As initial
condition we therefore set I(t = 1) = 1 and t = 1 corresponds to December 22nd, 2019. As for
France we use R0 = 2.682.86
2.47 leading to γ = 0.37 if fixing λ0 ' 1. A first semi-lockdown was set
in Italy on March 9th, 2020 (t = 78) and enforced on March 22nd, 2020 (t = 89). To simulate
these two-steps lockdown we again base our reduction in R0 on the mobility data for Italy which
show for the first part of the confinement a reduction of about 50 % and a similar reduction to
France (75%) for the strict lockdown phase. Figure 2 shows the results for the first wave by
letting λ = 0.25 ± ∆λ , where ∆λ represents a 20% fluctuations around the mean value, and by
fixing an initial condition on susceptible individuals S(1) = 6.0 · 107 corresponding to the estimate
of the Italian population. A clear difference emerges with respect to the case of France in the
behavior of R0 which shows an intermediate reduction near t = 80, corresponding to March 11th,
0.9
2020, to R0 = 1.41.7
1.1 before reaching the final value of R0 = 0.70.5 . This sort of "step" into the

R0 time behavior corresponds to the time interval between semi- and full-lockdown measures,
whose efficiency significantly increases after March 24th, 2020, also corresponding to the peak
value of infections. This is confirmed by looking at daily infections distributions (Figure 2c) that
shows a peak value near March 24th, 2020, also observed in real COVID-19 data27 . Finally, the
cumulative number of infections (Figure 2b) shows that, on average, almost 10 millions people
have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 in Italy, ranging between few hundred thousands up to 25
millions due to the the error propagation by the stochastic fluctuations of model parameters (see24
for explanations). Nevertheless the wide range of uncertainty the average value is close to the
value estimated from a team of experts of the Imperial College London according to which the
9.6% of Italian population has been infected, with a 95% confidence level ranging between 3.2%
and 26%52 . These estimates correspond to cumulative infections of ∼6 millions, ranging from ∼2
8

and ∼16 millions, well in agreement with our model and other statistical estimates53 .

B.

Future epidemics scenarios
After lockdown measures are released, for both countries, we model three different scenarios: a

first one where all restrictions are lifted (back to normality), a second one where strict measures are
taken (semi-lockdown) and a third one where the population remains mostly confined (lockdown).
a.

France

Results for France are shown in Figure 3. Lockdown is released at t = 136, corresponding to
May 11th, 2020. The back to normality (red) scenario clearly shows a second wave of infections
peaking in summer (early July) and forcing group immunity in the French population. The semilockdown (green) scenario, corresponding to a reduction of the mobility of about 50%, leads to
a second wave as intense as the first wave, but longer, at the end of August. As in the previous
scenario, the semi-lockdown scenario allows to reach a group immunity in France. A third lockdown scenario is modelled (blue). This latter scenario simulates an R0 ' 1, that can be achieved
by imposing strict distancing measures, contact tracking as well as reduction in mobility. It results
in a linear modest increase of the total number of infections that does not produce a proper wave of
infections. As in the first wave modelling, large uncertainties are also present in future scenarios
although the three distinct behaviors clearly appear.
b.

Italy

Figure 4 shows the results for modeling future epidemic scenarios for Italy. The first relaxation
of lockdown measures started at t = 131, corresponding to May 4th, 2020, while strict measures
were finally released at t = 146, corresponding to May 18th, 2020. The back to normality (red)
scenario moves towards a second wave of infections whose peak occurs at t = 193, corresponding to July 4th, 2020, exactly three months after initial lockdown measures were released (May
4th, 2020). This would lead the so-called herd immunity for the whole Italian population (see Figure 4b), with a peak of daily infections near 5 millions of people (Figure 4c), and R0 re-approaching
the initial value (R0 = 2.68). The semi-lockdown (green) scenario produces a second wave mostly
similar, in terms of intensity, as the first wave, but occurring at t = 246, e.g., August 26th, 2020.
This scenario will lead to 40 millions infected people, spanning between 25 and 55 millions, thus
producing a group immunity in Italy. A third scenario is modelled in which complete lockdown
measures are still considered (blue). This latter scenario leads to a more controlled evolution of
9

cumulative infections which still remain practically unchanged with respect to the first wave cumulative number. It has been obtained by simulating an R0 ' 1, resulting from strict distancing
measures and reduced mobility, and does not produce a proper wave of infections. However, all
scenarios are clearly characterized by a wide range of uncertainties, although producing three well
distinct behaviors in both cumulative and daily infections.

C.

Phase Diagrams
In the previous section we have seen that increasing R0 above 1 can or not produce a second

wave of infections and introduce also a time delay in the appearance of a second wave of infections. We now analyse this effect in a complete phase diagram fashion. Figures 5-6 show the
phase diagrams for France and for Italy, respectively. The diagrams are built in terms of ensemble
averages of number of infections per day I(t) versus the average value of R0 after the confinement (panels a), and the errors (represented as standard deviation of the average I(t) over the 30
realisations) are shown in panels b. First we note that despite some small differences in the delay of the COVID-19 second wave of infections peak, the diagrams are very similar. In order to
avoid a second wave, R0 could fluctuate on values even slightly larger than one. Furthermore, for
1.5 < R0 < 2, the second wave is delayed in Autumn or Winter 2020/2021 months. The uncertainty follows the same behavior as the average and it peaks when the number of daily infections
is maximum. This means that the ability to control the outcome of the epidemics is highly reduced
if R0 is too high.

V.

DISCUSSION
France and Italy have faced a long phase of lockdown with severe restrictions in mobility and

social contacts. They have managed to reduce the number of daily COVID-19 infections drastically and released almost simultaneously lockdown measures. This paper addresses the possible
future scenarios of COVID-19 infections in those countries by using one of the simplest possible
model capable to reproduce the first wave of infections and to take into account uncertainties,
namely a stochastic SEIR model with fluctuating parameters.

We have first verified that the model is capable to reproduce the behavior of the first wave of
10

infections and provide an estimate of COVID-19 prevalence that is coherent with clinical tests
and other studies. The introduction of stochasticity accounts for the large uncertainties in both
the initial conditions as well as the fluctuations in the basic reproduction number R0 originating
from changes in virus characteristics, mobility or misapplication in confinement measures. 30
realisations of the model have been produced and they show very different COVID-19 prevalence
after the first wave. The range goes from thousands of infected to tens of millions of infections in
both countries. Average values are compatible with those found in other studies49,52 .

Then, we have modelled future epidemics scenarios by choosing specific fluctuating behaviors
for R0 and performing again, 30 realisations of the stochastic SEIR model. Despite the very large
uncertainties, distinct scenarios clearly appear from the noise. In particular, they suggest that a
second wave can be avoided even with R0 values slightly larger than one. This means that actual
distancing measures which include the use of surgical masks, the reduction in mobility and the
active contact tracking can be effective in avoiding a second peak of infections without the need
of imposing further strict lockdown measures. The analysis of phase diagrams show that there is
a sharp transition between observing or not a second wave of infections when the value of R0 is
close to 1.5. Moreover, the models show that the higher R0 , the lower the ability to control the
number of infections in the epidemics.
This model has also evident deficiencies in representing the COVID-19 infections. First of all,
the choice of the initial conditions is conditioned by our ignorance on the diffusion of the virus in
France and Italy in December 2019. Furthermore, we are unable to verify on an extensive dataset
the outcome of the first wave: on one side antibodies blood tests have still a lower reliability54
and on the other they have not been applied on an extensive number of individuals to get reliable
estimates. On top of the data-driven limitations, we have those introduced by the use of compartment models, as there are geographic, social and age differences in the spread of the COVID-19
disease in both countries18 . Furthermore, we also assume that fluctuations on the parameters of
the SEIR model are Gaussian, although there are good reasons to think that they should be heavy
tailed distributions50,55 . We would like to remark however that, to overcome these limitations,
one would need to fit more complex models and introduce additional parameters which can, at the
present stage, barely inferred by the data.

Our choice to stick the stochastic SEIR model is indeed driven by its simplicity and the possi11

bility of modeling realistic the uncertainties with the stochastic fluctuations instead of adding new
parameters whose inference may affect the results. This study can be applied to other countries,
and this is why we publish along the code of our analysis alongside with the paper. To date, Northern Europe, UK, US and other American countries are still facing the first wave of infections, so
that future scenarios cannot be devised with the same clarity as those outlined in this study for
France and Italy.
