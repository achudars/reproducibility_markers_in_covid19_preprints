Summary
With the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, social media has rapidly become a crucial
communication tool for information generation, dissemination, and consumption. In this
scoping review, we selected and examined peer-reviewed empirical studies relating to
COVID-19 and social media during the first outbreak starting in November 2019 until May
2020. From an analysis of 81 studies, we identified five overarching public health themes
concerning the role of online social platforms and COVID-19. These themes focused on: (i)
surveying public attitudes, (ii) identifying infodemics, (iii) assessing mental health, (iv)
detecting or predicting COVID-19 cases, (v) analyzing government responses to the
pandemic, and (vi) evaluating quality of health information in prevention education videos.
Furthermore, our review highlights the paucity of studies on the application of machine
learning on social media data related to COVID-19 and a lack of studies documenting realtime surveillance developed with social media data on COVID-19. For COVID-19, social
media can play a crucial role in disseminating health information as well as tackling
infodemics and misinformation.
Introduction
The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Novel
Coronavirus (SARS-COV-2), is a significant international public health issue. As of
November 14, 2020, an estimated 53.5 million people around the world have been infected
with the virus, with about 1.3 million deaths. 1 As a consequence of the pandemic, social
media is becoming the platform of choice for public opinions, perceptions, and attitudes
towards various events or public health policies regarding COVID-19. 2 Social media has
become an even more pivotal communication tool for governments, organizations, and
universities to disseminate crucial information to the public. Numerous studies have already
used social media data to help identify and detect infectious disease outbreaks and to
interpret public attitudes, behaviours, and perceptions.3-6 Social media, particularly Twitter,
may be used to explore multiple facets of public health research. A recent systematic review
identified six categories of Twitter use for health research, namely, content analysis,
surveillance, engagement, recruitment, interventions, and frequency analysis of Twitter
users.4 However, this review only included broader research terms such as health, medicine,
or disease using Twitter data and did not focus on specific disease topics such as COVID-

19. Another article analyzed tweets on COVID-19 and identified 12 topics categorized into
four main themes: the origin of COVID-19, the source of the coronavirus, impact of COVID19 on individuals, and countries, and methods of decreasing the spread of COVID-19. 7 In
this study data were not available on COVID-19 related tweets before February 2020 thereby
missing the initial part of the epidemic, and the data on tweets were limited to Twitter only
within a one-month period.
Social media can also be effectively used to communicate health information to the general
public during a pandemic. Emerging infectious diseases (EID), such as COVID-19, almost
always results in increased usage and consumption of media of all forms by the general
public for information.8 Therefore, social media plays a vital role in people’s perception of
disease exposure, resultant decision making and risk behaviours.9,10 As information on
social media is generated by users, such information can be subjective or inaccurate, and
frequently includes rumours, misinformation, and conspiracy theories. 11 Hence, it is
imperative that accurate and timely information is disseminated to the general public about
emerging threats such as the novel coronavirus. A systematic review explored the major
approaches used in published research on social media and EID.12 The review identified
three major approaches: (a) assessment of the public’s interest in and responses to EID, (b)
examination of organizations’ use of social media in communicating EID, and (c) evaluation
of the accuracy of EID related medical information on social media. However, this review
did not focus on studies that used social media data to track and predict EID outbreaks.

Analyzing and disseminating information from peer-reviewed published research can guide
policymakers and public health agencies to design interventions for accurate and timely
knowledge translation to the general public. Therefore, keeping in view the gaps mentioned
above, we conducted a scoping review with the aim of understanding what roles social media
have been playing since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. We wanted to know
specifically about public attitudes and perceptions towards COVID-19 on social media,
information about COVID-19 on social media, social media use for prediction and detection
of COVID-19, the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and government responses to
COVID-19 on social media. Our objective was to identify studies on social media related to
COVID-19 that focused on the following: (1) Infodemics (2) Public attitudes, (3) Mental
health, (4) Detection or prediction of COVID-19 cases, (5) Government responses to the
pandemic, and (6) Quality of health information in videos.

Methods
Overview
Studies exploring the use of social media on COVID-19 were reviewed using the scoping
review methodology of Arksey and O’Malley13 and Levac et al.14 The five-step scoping
review protocol was followed, and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for scoping reviews was employed in this study.
Data Sources
Exploratory searches were conducted on COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge
(CORD-19) as well as Google Scholar in April 2020. These searches helped define the
review scope, develop the research questions, and determine eligibility criteria. After such
activity, MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO were selected for this review since
they include peer-reviewed literature in the fields of medicine, behavioural sciences,
psychology, healthcare system, and clinical sciences. Since the start of the current pandemic,
COVID-19 articles were reviewed and published at an unprecedently rapid rate with
numerous publications that were peer-reviewed and available ahead of print, referred to as
"pre-prints" or "articles in press." In this review, we consider peer-reviewed pre-prints
equivalent to normal peer-reviewed articles, and relevant articles were screened accordingly.
Search Strategy and Selection Criteria
The search strategies utilized index terms, where applicable, and free-text terms to capture
the following two concepts: (a) social media, including both general terms and specific
platform names (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Weibo, YouTube); (b) COVID-19. For each
database, both indexed terms (i.e., MeSH, Emtree) and natural language keywords were used
with Boolean operators (i.e., AND, OR, NOT) and truncations. Table 1 shows keywords,
indexed terms, and their variations used for the literature search. Since each database has
distinctive search functionality, individually tailored search statements were developed with
appropriate search filters for each database. Final search statements, along with a list of
search results, were downloaded from each database.

Articles were included if (a) they discussed the use of social media for COVID-19 research,
and (b) were original, empirical studies. Only peer-reviewed articles, including peer-reviewed
preprints, in English or Chinese, were included. A decision to include Chinese publications
was based on the fact that COVID-19 cases were first reported in Wuhan, China and many
initial and relevant studies were published in Chinese; therefore, we wanted to capture a
majority of studies that were on the use of social media for COVID-19 research. All articles
published between November 1, 2019, and November 4, 2020, were included. Publications
such as reviews, opinion pieces, pre-prints, books, book chapters and any empirical study that
were not peer-reviewed or written in languages other than English or Chinese were
automatically excluded. The final reference list was generated based on originality and
relevance to the broad scope of this review.
Screening Procedure
Primary reviewer (SFT) mainly carried out title and abstract screening for each article to
determine if an article met the inclusion criteria. If the criteria were confirmed, then it was
included; otherwise, it was excluded. Articles were broken into paragraphs to contain one code
in each section. Next, quotes were sorted under each code, applying Ose’s method. 15 Braun
and Clark’s thematic analysis method was employed and involved searching for the text that
matched the identified predictors (codes) in from the quantitative analysis and discovering

emergent codes that were relevant to either the study objective or identified in the relevant
literature review.16 Finally, we categorized the codes into main themes. These codes and
themes were compared and clarified to draw conclusions around the main themes by SFT, ZB,
and RY. SFT is fluent in both English and Chinese; the secondary reviewer (ZB) is fluent in
English, and the tertiary reviewer and domain expert (YY, HC) are both fluent in English and
Chinese. Any discrepancies among reviewers were discussed with the research team to reach
consensus.
Results
Figure 1 illustrates the PRISMA flow diagram of the literature search. With the application of
appropriate search filters, a total of 2405 articles were retrieved from the identified databases:
PubMed (n=1084), Scopus (n=1021) and PsycINFO (n=300). Among these, 670 duplicates
were excluded. Of the remaining 1735 articles, 1434 were deemed non-empirical, such as
comments, editorial essays, letters, opinions, and reviews. This left 301 articles for a full-text
review based on the screening results of titles and abstracts. After the full-text review, 81

Table 21 summarizes the 81 selected articles on COVID-19 and social media. All articles were
written in English. Twitter (n=45) and Weibo (n=16) undoubtedly were the most studied social
media data. To categorize these chosen articles, we adopted a novel framework called “Social
media and Public Health Epidemic and REsponses (SPHERE) and developed a modified
version of SPHERE framework to organize the themes for our scoping review, as shown in
Figure 2.17 Themes were identified through reviewers’ consensus based on our modified
SPHERE framework. We identified six themes: (i) infodemics, (ii) public attitudes, (iii) mental
health, (iv) detecting or predicting COVID-19 cases, (v) government responses, and (vi) quality
of health information in videos.

Social Media as Contagion and Vector
1. Infodemics
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the term “infodemic,” a combination of
“information” and “epidemic,” refers to a fast and widespread of both accurate and inaccurate
information about something, such as a disease like COVID-19.18 Twelve articles tackled
COVID-19 related infodemics circulating on social media platforms. Rovetta and
Bhagavathula analyzed over 2 million queries from Google Trends and Instagram between
1

Table 2 is displayed at the end of this paper

February 20 and May 6, 2020. Their findings revealed that as global interest of COVID-19
information increased, so did its infodemic.19 Gallotti et al analyzed over 100 million tweets
and found that even before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, entire Inlay’s expose
measurable waves of infodemic has threatened public health.20 Pulido et al sampled and
analyzed 942 tweets which revealed that while false information had higher number of tweets,
it also had less retweets and lower engagement than tweets comprising scientific evidence or
factual statements.21 Kouzy et al22 set out to investigate the extent to which misinformation or
unverifiable information about the COVID-19 pandemic was spread on Twitter by analyzing
673 English tweets. Their results showed that misinformation accounted for 24.8% of all
tweets. Healthcare or public health accounts had the lowest rate; yet still 12.3% of their tweets
included unverifiable information. Moscadelli et al collected and reviewed 2,102 news articles
circulated on the internet. Their analysis revealed that fake news accounted for 23.1% of
articles studied which were shared over 2 million times between December 31, 2019 and April
30, 2020.23 Similarly, another quantitative study by Galhardi et al comparing the proportion of
fake news shared on WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook in Brazil revealed that fake news
was predominately shared on WhatsApp.24 A UK study by Ahmed et al, analyzed 22,785 tweets
posted by 11,333 Twitter users with “#FilmYourHospital” hashtag to identify and evaluate the
source of conspiracy theory on Twitter. Their work uncovered that ordinary people were the
major driver behind the spread of conspiracy theories.25 Another research investigated the 5G
and COVID-19 conspiracy theory circulating on Twitter with a random sample of 233 tweets.
The content analysis showed that 34.8% tweets linked 5G and COVID-19 and 32.2%
condemned such theory 26. A similar research by Bruns et al investigated 89,664 distinct
Facebook posts in Australia related to such conspiracy from 1 January to 12 April 2020 using
time series and network analysis.27 The results showed that this conspiracy went viral after
March 19, 2020 with unusual coalition among various groups on Facebook. Islam et al
analyzed 2,311 COVID-19 related infodemic reports from December 31, 2019 to April 5, 2020
and demonstrated misinformation was mainly driven by rumors, stigma, and conspiracy
theories circulating on various social media and other online platforms.28 Associations between
infodemic and bot activities on social media is another important research direction. One study
analyzed 12 million tweets from the US and 15 million tweets from the Philippines from March
5 to 19, 2020 and both countries showed a positive relation between bot activities and rate of
hate speech in denser and more isolated communities.29 Brennen et al qualitatively analyzed
96 samples of visuals from January through March 2020 and categorized misinformation into
6 trends, and found, fortunately, there have been no involvement of AI “deepfakes” techniques

so far.30
Social Media for Surveillance and Monitoring
Three themes emerged under this category: public attitudes, mental health, and detection or
prediction of COVID-19 cases. The former two themes are reflections regarding the public
perceptions and mental health impacts of the pandemic; the latter includes typical surveillance
studies aiming to propose ways for the detection or prediction of the COVID-19 cases.
1. Public attitudes
Forty-eight selected articles gauged the attitudes and emotions expressed by social media users
regarding the COVID-19 pandemic mainly by employing content and sentiment analysis.
Twitter and Weibo accounted for 34 and 8 articles, respectively. This theme can be further
divided into the following sub-themes: (1) Public sentiment toward the COVID-19 pandemic
and interventions, (2) stigma and racism, and (3) ageism.
1.1 Public sentiment
To learn what the public’s perspectives about the overall COVID-19 pandemic and its
interventions, Alaa Abd-Alrazaq et al.7 analyzed 167,073 unique English tweets divided into
four categories: origin of the COVID-19 virus; sources of the virus; its regional and global
impact on people and society; and methods to reduce its infection. Tweets regarding economic
loss had the highest average number of likes whereas travel bans and warning had the lowest.7
Kwon et al investigated 259,529 English tweets in the USA using trending and spatiotemporal
analyses and uncovered tweets about social disruptiveness had highest number of retweets and
tweets about COVID-19 interventions had highest number of likes.31 A content analysis of 522
Reddit comments showed that “Symptoms” accounted for 27% of all comments, followed by
“Prevention” (25%).32 Likewise, another content analysis of 155,353 unique English tweets
show the most mentioned topic was “peril of COVID-19.”33 Still another research examined
126,049 English tweets using sentiment analysis and latent Dirichlet analysis (LDA) for topic
modeling revealed the most common emotion mentioned was fear, and the most common topic
mentioned was the economic and political effects.34 Al-Rawi et al studied emojis in over 50
million tweets and identified 5 primary subjects: “morbidity fears,” “health concerns,”
“employment and financial issues,” “praise for frontline workers,” and “unique gendered emoji

use.”35 Samuel et al investigated 293,597 tweets with sentiment analysis and found more
positive emotions toward the US economy re-opening than negative emotions. 36 Analyzing
2,558,474 English tweets using clustering and network analyses, Odlum et al found African
Americans shared positive sentiments and encouraged virtual discussions and prevention
behaviours.37 A study investigated gender differences in terms of topics by analyzing 3,038,026
English tweets.38 The results demonstrated that tweets from females were more likely about
family, social distancing, and healthcare, whereas tweets from males were more about sports
cancellations, pandemic severity, and politics. In Canada, Xue et al analyzed 1,015,874 tweets
via LDA to identify nine themes about family violence.39 In Australia, Yigitcanlar et al
analyzed 96,666 tweets and found that the public’s attitude could be captured efficiently. 40 One
qualitative content analysis of 30 profiles from Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok in Brunei
resulted in five types of attitudes toward social distancing: fear, responsibility, annoyance, fun,
and resistance.41 Arpaci et al in Turkey investigated 43 million tweets from March 22 to 30,
2020 via evolutionary clustering analysis. Their findings showed that words like “death”,
“test”, “spread”, and “lockdown” appeared more frequently, suggesting people are afraid of
infection, and death, and staying at home due to such fear, and supportive of

social

distancing.42 A study conducted in Luzon, Philippines,43 where sentiment analysis was
employed using natural language processing (NLP), revealed that most Filipino Twitter users
expressed negative emotions towards COVID-19, and the negative mood grew stronger
overtime under the lockdown.43 Sentiment analysis of 107,990 English tweets uncovered that
negative feeling toward COVID-19 pandemic dominated in Thailand, and topic modeling
revealed three major themes in people’s concerns: “the COVID-19 pandemic emergency,”
“how to control COVID-19,” and “reports on COVID-19.”44 Another research analyzed
373,908 tweets and retweets in Belgian which showed that the public focused more on EU
coalition to tackle the pandemic.45 De Santis et al analyzed 1,044,645 tweets to identify daily
hot topics related to COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and developed a framework for prospective
research.46 One thematic analysis study of 1,920,593 Arabic tweets in Egypt revealed that
negative emotions and sadness were loaded in tweets showing affective discussions, and the
dominant themes included “the outbreak of the pandemic,” “metaphysics responses,” “signs
and symptoms in confirmed cases,” and “conspiracism.”47 In Singapore, Lwin et al examined
20,325,929 tweets using sentiment analysis and showed the public emotions shifted over time:
from fear to anger and from sadness to grateful.48 Chang et al examined over 1.07 million
Chinese texts from various online sources in Taiwan using deductive analysis and found
negative sentiments mainly came from online news with stigmatizing languages linked with

the COVID-19 pandemic.49 In India, one study investigated 410,643 tweets via sentiment
analysis and LDA and showed that positive emotions were overall significantly higher than
negative sentiments, but this observation diminished at individual levels. 50 Another research
analyzed 29,554 tweets from lockdown 2.0 and 47,672 tweets from lockdown 3.0 via sentiment
analysis uncovered positive attitudes toward lockdown 2.0 but turned to negative attitudes
toward lockdown 3.0 in India.51 One study analyzed 868 posts from Reddit and found
sentiments to be 50% neutral, 22% positive, and 28% negative in India.52 A study in South
Korea examined 43,832 unique users and their relations on Twitter using content and network
analyses demonstrated tweets including medical news were more popular.53 A research from
Ireland analyzed 203,756 tweets through topic modeling and identified that “WAR” was the
most common used frame.54 In the USA, Damiano et al qualitatively analyzed 600 English
tweets and showed neutral sentiment. Politics also played an essential role in shaping people’s
opinion.55 A research studied 19,803 tweets from Democrats and 11,084 tweets from
Republicans using RF in the USA and showed that Democrats emphasized more on public
health threats to American workers, whereas Republicans emphasized more threats from China
and business.56 Results of a study involved various online data sources from Italy, UK, USA,
and Canada showed media was the major driver of the public’s attention, despite rapid
saturation.57 Compared with other users, Reddit users focused more on disease data and
prevention interventions. Researchers in Spain studied 22,223 tweets using topic modeling and
network analysis.58 They identified eight frames and found that the entire pandemic could be
divided into three periods: “pre-crisis,” “lockdown” and “recovery” periods. On the other hand.
Jelodar et al proposed a novel method to detect meaningful latent-topics and sentimentcomment-classification on COVID-19–related posts using 563,079 COVID-19–related
English Reddit posts.59 Samuel et al examined over 900,000 tweets to study the accuracy of
tweet classifications among logistic regression and Naïve Bayes (NB) methods. They found
that NB had 91% of accuracy compared with 74% from the logistic regression model.60
Another study investigated how the Chinese government used the popular social media
platform, Sina Weibo, to promote citizen engagement during the COVID-19 crisis.61 Xuehua
Han et al.62 analyzed 1,413,297 Weibo posts and found that the public reacted sensitively to
the epidemic, especially in metro areas.62 Zhao et al studied 4,056 topics from the Sina
Microblog hot search list and found the public emotions shifted from negative to neural to
positive over time, and five major public concerns63. Jiawei Li et al.64 conducted an
observational infoveillance study with a linear regression model by analyzing 115,299 Weibo

posts. The results showed that the number of Weibo posts positively correlated with the number
of reported cases of coronavirus in Wuhan. In addition, the qualitative analysis classified the
topics into the following four overarching themes: (a) cause of the virus; (b) epidemiological
characteristics of the COVID-19; (c) public responses; and (d) others. 65 Qiang Chen et al.
examined relationships between citizen engagement through government social media
(CEGSM) and media richness, dialogic loop, content type, and emotion valence.61 GEGSM
refers to sum of shares, likes, and comments in this study, so the higher the sum, the greater
the GEGSM. Media richness quantifies how much a sender transfers information to a receiver
via a medium based on the media richness theory. Dialogic loop, or dialogic communication
theory, is defined as an approach that promotes a dialogue between a speaker and audience.
According to the American Psychological Association (APA), emotion valence refers to “the
value associated with a stimulus expressed on a continuum from pleasant to unpleasant or from
attractive to aversive”.65 For instance, happiness is typically considered pleasant valence. The
researchers analyzed 1,411 COVID-19 related posts from "Healthy China," an official account
of the National Health Commission of China (NHCC) on Weibo. Findings showed an inverse
association between media richness and CEGSM, indicating that posts with plain texts had
higher CEGSM than posts with pictures or videos. A positive association between dialogic
loop and CEGSM was found, as evidenced by 96% posts using hashtags and 25% employing
questions. CEGSM also had a positive relationship with emotion valence, as evidenced by
higher CEGSM with positive emotions shown in posts.61 The last chosen article proposed a
new multiple-information susceptible-discussing-immune (M-SDL) model to analyze the
public opinion propagation of the COVID-19 from Weibo posts collected from December 31,
2019, to February 27, 2020. The researchers reported that the reproduction rate of this proposed
M-SDL model reached 1.78 in the early stage of COVID-19 but decreased to and maintained
around 0.97. Such a result demonstrated that the information on COVID-19 would continue to
erupt slowly in the future until it stabilized without violent information outbreak.Wang et al
analyzed 999,978 randomly selected COVID-19 related Weibo posts through unsupervised
BERT model for sentiments and TF-IDF model for topic modeling. They identified four public
concerns: “the virus origin,” “symptom,” “production activity,” and “public health control” in
China.66 Xi et al examined 241 topics with their views and comments via thematic and temporal
analysis and found the “Contributing to the community” theme was the most dominant in the
first phase (January 20–February 20, 2020).67 The “Older patients in hospitals” theme was most
prevailing in the second (February 21–March 17, 2020) and third phase (March 18–April 28,
2020). Employing Wilcoxon tests, Su et al examined posts from 850 Weibo users and 14,269

Tweets from Italy.68 The findings showed Italians paid more attention to leisure whereas
Chinese paid more attention on group, religion, and emotions after lockdowns. Analyzing top
200 accounts from WeChat via regressions and content analysis, Ma et al found positive
impacts of nonmedical and medical reports on people’s behaviours. 69 Employing Kendall’s
Tau-B rank test, Xie et al investigated relations among Baidu Attention Index (BAI), daily
Google Trends, and numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths. 70 Daily GT was correlated to 7
indicators, whereas daily BAI was only correlated to 3 indicators.

71

Eventually, Zhu et al

analyzed 1,858,288 Weibo posts and found topics changed over time, but political and
economic posts attracted greater attentions.71
1.2 Stigma and Racism
Bumsoo Kim72 analyzed 27,849 individual tweets in South Korea using a binary logistic
regression to gauge network size, and semantic network analysis to capture contextual and
subjective factors. The results indicated that social network size was inversely correlated with
impolite language use. Namely, users with larger social networks were less likely to post
uncivil messages on Twitter. This study suggested that the social network size influenced social
media users' language choice in their postings.72 A research compared pre- and postintroduction of “Chinese virus” or “China virus” influenced the public stigma with 16,535
English tweets from pre-introduction period and 177,327 tweets from post-introduction
period.73 The results showed an almost 10 times increase nationwide and statewide from 0.38
tweets referencing those two terms posted per 10,000 people in the pre-period to 4.08 tweets
post-period in the USA. Another similar study examined 339,063 tweets from non-Asian
respondents via local polynomial regression and interrupted time-series analysis.74 The
findings demonstrated that when stigmatizing terms like “Chinese virus” were used by media
starting from March 8, 2020, the bias index—Implicit Americanness Bias—began to increase,
and such bias was more profound in conservatives. Nguyen et al analyzed 3,377,295 racerelated tweets in the USA using sentiment analysis uncovered a 68.4%. increase in negative
tweets referring Asians whereas tweets referring other races remained stable.75
1.3 Ageism
A study76 investigating Twitter content related to both COVID-19 and older adults analyzed a
random sample of 351 English tweets. It turned out that 21.1% of the tweets implied diminished
regard for older adults by downplaying or dismissing concerns over the high fatality of
COVID-19 on this population.76 Another similar research examined 188 tweets via thematic

analysis and revealed 90% against ageism, whereas 5% back up and 5% neutral.77
2. Mental Health
Two of the 81 reviewed studies, both based in China, focused on assessing social media users’
mental health.78,79 A cross-sectional study78 investigated the relationship between anxiety and
social media exposure (SME), theoretically defined as “the extent to which audience members
have encountered specific messages”.80 The researchers distributed an online survey based on
the Chinese version of WHO-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) for depression and the Chinese
version of generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7) for anxiety. Respondents included 4,872
Chinese citizens aged 18 and over from 31 provinces and autonomous regions in China. After
controlling for all covariates through a multivariable logistic regression, the finding uncovered
that frequent SME increased the odds ratio of anxiety, demonstrating frequent SME potentially
contributing to the mental health problems during the COVID-19 outbreak.78 To explore how
people's mental health was influenced by the COVID-19, Li et al.798 analyzed posts from
17,865 active Weibo users to compare pre- and post-declaration of COVID-19 on 20 January,
2020. The researchers uncovered increased negative sentiments including anxiety, depression,
and indignation post-declaration, and decreased positive sentiments expressed in Oxford
happiness score. Additionally, cognitive indicators increased in social risk judgment but
decreased in life satisfaction post-declaration.78
3. Detection or prediction of COVID-19 cases
Six of the 81 studies investigated the prediction of COVID-19 outbreaks using social media
data. Qin et al.79 attempted to predict the number of new suspected or confirmed COVID-19
cases by collecting social media search indexes (SMSI) for symptoms such as dry cough, fever,
chest distress, coronavirus, and pneumonia. The data were analyzed using subset selection,
forward selection, lasso regression, ridge regression, and elastic net. Results showed the
optimal model was constructed via the subset selection. The lagged SMSI was a predictor of
new suspected COVID-19 cases and could be detected 6-9 days before the new case
confirmation77. To evaluate the possibility of early prediction of the COVID-19 cases via
internet searches and social media data, Li et al.82 used keywords “coronavirus” and
“pneumonia” to retrieve corresponding trend data from Google Trends, Baidu Index, and Sina
Weibo Index. Using the lag correlation, the results showed that for new lab-confirmed cases,

the highest correlation was found 9-12 days earlier for the keyword "coronavirus" in the three
platforms. Similarly, for the new suspected cases, the highest correlation was found 6-8 days
earlier for “coronavirus.” The keyword “pneumonia” for new suspected cases had the highest
correlation eight days earlier across the three platforms. 82Peng et al studied 1,200 Weibo
records using spatiotemporal analysis, kernel density analysis, and ordinary least square
regression and found that “scattered infection”, “community spread”, and “full-scale outbreak”
were three phases of early COVID-19 transmission in Wuhan, China. 83 Elderly accounted for
over 50% of help seeking on Weibo, thus of high risk. To identify COVID-19 patients with
poor prognosis, Liu et al, analyzed Weibo messages from 599 patients along with telephone
follow-ups.84 The findings suggested risk factors involving older age, diffuse distribution, and
hypoxemia. A regression study analyzed GT searches, Wikipedia page views, and tweets and showed
that using current Wikipedia page views, one‐week‐ahead tweets, and two‐week ahead GT searches
were included to model the number of COVID-19 cases.- To model the number of deaths, all three
variables should be one-week further ahead85.

Social Media as Disease Control

1. Government Responses
To make the public inoculated against misinformation, public health organizations should
create and spread accurate information on social media because social media have increasingly
played an important role in policy announcement and health education. Six of the 81 articles
were categorized as “government responses” because they examined how government
messages and health education material were generated and consumed on social media
platforms. Two studies analyzed data from Sina Weibo,86,88 and the other four studies analyzed
data from Twitter.88,89
Zhu et al.86 conducted a study to measure the attention of Chinese netizens—“citizen of the
net” according to Michael F. Hauben90—to COVID-19 by analyzing 1,101 Weibo posts. They
found that Chinese netizens paid little attention to the disease until the Chinese government
acknowledged and declared the COVID-19 outbreak on January 20, 2020. Since then, high
levels of social media traffic occurred when Wuhan began its quarantine (January 23-24, 2020),
during a Red Cross Society of China scandal (February 1, 2020), and following the death of
Dr. Li Wenliang (February 6-7, 2020).86 Lifang Li87 collected 36,746 Weibo posts to identify

and categorize the situational information using support vector machines (SVM), naive Bayes
(NB), and RF, as well as features in predicting the number of reports using linear regression.
Except for posts categorized as “counter-rumours,” they found the more word counts, the more
reposts for all the other types. Likewise, posts from unverified users had more reposts in all
types, excluding the counter-rumours. For the counter-rumours, reposts would increase if its
users have a greater number of followers and from urban areas.87 A qualitative content analysis
was conducted to investigate how G7 leaders used Twitter concerning the COVID-19
pandemic by collecting 203 tweets.88 The findings showed that 82.8% were “informative,”
28.6% of them linked to official government resources; 9.4% were "morale-boosting;” and
6.9% were “political”.88 To assess the political partisan polarization in Canada regarding
COVID-19, Merkley et al.89 random sampled 1,260 tweets from 292 federal members of
Parliament’s (MP) social media and collected 87 Google search trends for the search term
"coronavirus". A survey was also conducted with 2,499 Canadian respondents aged 18 years
and above. The results demonstrated that regardless of party affiliation, MP members
emphasized the importance of social distancing measures and proper hand hygiene practices to
cope with the COVID-19 pandemic without tweets exaggerating concerns or misinformation
about COVID-19. Search interest in coronavirus among municipalities was strongly
determined by socioeconomic and urban factors rather than Conservative party vote share.89
Sutton et al studied 149,335 tweets from public health, emergency management and elected
officials and found that messages changed positively and negatively over time.91 Besides,
Wang et al investigated 13,598 COVID-19 related tweets via temporal and network analyses. 92
They categorized 16 types of messages and identified inconsistent and incongruent messages
expressed in 4 critical prevention topics: mask wearing, risk assessments, stay at home order,
and disinfectants/sanitizers.
2. Prevention Education in Videos
Eight chosen studies investigated the quality of Youtube videos with COVID-19 prevention
information. Basch et al.93 conducted a cross-sectional study and retrieved the top 100 YouTube
videos with most views uploaded in January 2020 with keywords "Coronavirus" in English,
with English subtitles, or in Spanish. These 100 videos together generated over 125 million
views. However, less than 33 videos included any of seven key prevention behaviours
recommended by the US CDC.93 The same group of researchers conducted a follow-up study
with the same criteria and a successive sampling design to gather top 100 mostly viewed

YouTube videos in January and in March 2020, respectively. Findings showed that the January
sample generated over 125 million views, and the March sample had over 355 million views.
Yet less than 50- videos in either sample contained any of the prevention behaviours
recommended by the US CDC.94 Additionally, a research investigated the first 100 “DIY hand
sanitizer” videos on YouTube with the most views and showed the average number of daily
pediatric poisoning calls increased significantly in March 2020 compared with the previous 2
years.95
To analyze the information quality on YouTube about the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare
the contents in English and Chinese Mandarin videos, Priyanka Khatri et al.39 collected a total
of 150 videos with the keywords “2019 novel coronavirus,” “Wuhan virus” in English and in
Mandarin. The DISCERN score and the medical information and content index (MICI) were
calculated as a reliable way to measure the quality of health information. It turned out the
average DISCERN score for reliability was low: 3.12 out of 5 for English videos and 3.25 for
Mandarin videos. The average cumulative MICI score of useful videos was also undesirable:
6.71 out of 25 for English videos and 6.28 for Mandarin videos. 96 In Spain, a similar research
studied 129 videos in Spanish and found such videos were usually incomplete and differed
according to different uploaders. Likewise, one study in South Korea found misleading videos
accounted for 37% of all collected 105 most viewed, and such videos had more likes, fewer
comments, and longer viewing times than useful videos. Two studies in Turkey investigated
quality of YouTube videos regarding COVID-19 information in dentistry. 99,99 One analyzed
top 116 English videos with at least 300 views and showed moderate quality and useful
information from these videos.99 The other one, however, uncovered poor quality for 24 out of
55 (43.6%) English videos, whereas good quality accounted for only 2 (3.6%) videos. 100
Discussion

Studies on social media data revealed our attitudes and mental state to a certain extent during
the COVID-19 crisis. These studies also showed how we generated, consumed and propagated
information on social media platforms when facing the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus
and extraordinary measures for the containment. In our review, public attitudes accounted for
nearly 60% of the reviewed articles. In terms of social media platforms, 46% of the chosen
articles used data from Twitter, followed by Weibo (18%). Machine learning analyses, such as

LDA and RF, were applied in research that studied public attitudes.
We identified six themes based on our modified SPHERE framework, including (i) infodemics,
(ii) public attitudes (iii) mental health, (iv) detection or prediction of COVID-19 cases, (v)
government responses to the pandemic, and (vi) quality of prevention education videos.
However, a common limitation in all chosen studies using social media data is the “data
quality” challenge, such as various formats, metrics, or even the definition of a variable. For
instance, the definition of a “view” on one social media platform is likely different from
another. Besides, not every social media offers accessible data like Twitter and Weibo. To
address these challenges, the selected studies have controlled for many factors, including social
media platforms, languages, locations, time, misspellings, keywords, or hashtags. However,
such search strategies resulted in many study limitations, like non-representative sample sizes
or selection bias, cross-sectional or retrospective study design. We also observed that, given
the large amount of available data, most studies across all domains still sampled smaller data
size for analyses, except four studies under the “public attitudes” theme analyzing over one
million posts via machine learning methods. Additionally, data from Twitter and Weibo
accounted for over 60% of our selected studies. Research examining other social media
platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and WhatsApp, are limited due
to barriers of data availability and accessibility. We also identified future research topics
needed for each category as we are currently in the midst of a second wave of the COVID-19
pandemic . From “infodemics” perspective, additional research is needed to investigate how
effective misinformation/rumours/fake news, such as anti-mask wearing, undermine
preventions to compromise public health, although social media companies like Twitter and
Facebook recently started to remove misinformation-based accounts or label unaccountable
posts. Robot (or bot) posts is another focus to be addressed. Studies evaluating effective
counter-infodemic interventions are also needed.
Articles regarding “public attitudes” toward the COVID-19 pandemic have revealed sentiments
that shifted over time. Yet, this theme can be a useful indicator when evaluating interventions,
social distancing and wearing masks for instance, that aim to reduce the COVID-19 infection
risks. However, public sentiments have not been incorporated into many intervention studies
by the time we conducted this review. When a disease like COVID-19 starts spreading and
causing negative sentiments, timely, proper, and effective risk communication is needed to help
ease peoples’ anxiety or negative attitudes regarding the COVID-19 pandemic especially

through social media.
Mental health is another issue that requires further investigations. Our chosen studies did not
address mental health issues based on age, as youth and adults could struggle with different
problems and varied interventions. Public health measures such as social distancing
implemented in the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated risk factors and adverse health
behaviours at the individual and population levels. Studies have shown that social media data
were useful to detect mental health issues at the population level. Due to the early outbreak of
COVID-19 and the prevalence of social media (i.e. Weibo, WeChat) in China, two studies that
shed light on issues of mental health were both among the Chinese population. 78-79 Similar
deteriorating trend of mental health could happen in other regions. At the time of this writing,
British Columbia, Canada recorded the highest number of overdose deaths in May 2020.101
In terms of the surveillance of the COVID-19 pandemic, six chosen studies demonstrated
methods to detect or predict the number of COVID-19 cases using social media data. Unlike
other infectious diseases such as influenza and malaria, COVID-19 has not had real-time
monitoring surveillance developed with social media data according to our review. It is
possible that the pandemic has evolved so rapidly that finding COVID-19 vaccinations or
therapies has been prioritized over others. Besides, lacking accurate and reliable data sources
may discourage the development of the COVID-19 real-time surveillance. Moreover, it
remains unknown whether COVID-19 is just a one-time black swan event or would become
something like the seasonal flu. If the latter, then it may be meaningful and useful to establish
a real-time model to monitor the disease using social media data.
Government responses distributed via social media have increasingly played critical in
combating infodemics and promoting accurate and reliable information for the public.
However, little has been studied about how efficient and effective these official reactions lead
to belief or behavioural changes in real life. It also remained unknown that, compared with
infodemics, government posts would reach greater numbers of social media users or have
greater impacts on them.
YouTube has served as one of major platforms to spread information concerning the disease
control of COVID-19. Nonetheless, our chosen studies revealed undesirable quality for these
videos because they contained few recommended preventions from the governments or public

health organizations. It is a worrisome observation if accurate and reliable videos and other
types of information are not created and disseminated in a timely manner. Therefore, videos,
especially from public health authorities, should include accurate and reliable medical and
scientific information and use relevant hashtags to reach more audience, generate more views
and increase responses. Moreover, our selected studies were limited to YouTube videos only.
Additionally, a significant proportion of the studies were done using Sina Weibo, which,
although used by a large number of people, is exclusive of China, which may lead to an overrepresentation of a single country in the scoping review.
In summary, although our scoping review has limitations embedded from the chosen studies,
it recognized six themes that have been studied so far, and future research directions are also
identified. Our adopted framework can serve as a fundamental and flexible guideline when
conducting studies related to social media and epidemiology.
Conclusions

Our review identified various topics, themes and methodological approaches in studies on
social media and COVID-19. Among the six identified themes, public attitudes comprised the
majority of the articles. Among the selected studies, Twitter was the leading social media
platform followed by Weibo. A minority of the studies included machine learning methods,
whereas a vast majority employed traditional statistical methods. Unlike influenza, we were
not able to find studies documenting real-time surveillance developed with social media data
on COVID-19. Our review also identified studies on COVID-19 related infodemics, mental
health and prediction. For COVID-19, accurate and reliable information through social media
platforms can play a crucial role in tackling infodemics, misinformation, and rumours.
Additionally, real time surveillance from social media about COVID-19 can be an important
tool in the armamentarium of interventions by public health agencies and organizations.

help clinicians identify patients
with COVID-19 who have poor
prognosis
Aggregated data from social media
can also be comprehensive,
immediate, and informative in
disease prognosis.

To model of the number of cases,
the current Wikipedia page views,
1‐week‐ahead tweets, and 2‐week
ahead Google searches were
employed.
To model of the number of deaths,
each variable was placed 1 week
further ahead.

Thematic analysis

•

•

Unigram terms appear more
frequently than bigram and trigram
terms.
During the epidemic, a large
number of tweets about COVID-19
were distributed and attracted
widespread public attention.
High-frequency words e.g.
“death”, “test”, “spread”, and
“lockdown” indicate that people
are afraid of being infected, and
the affected are fear of death
People agree to stay at home due
to fear of spread and have called
for social distancing since they
become aware of COVID-19.
90% of all tweets opposed
calculated ageism, while only 5%
supported it and 5% conveyed no
position.
Opposition centered on moral
critiques, political-economic
critiques, assertions of older
adults’ worth, and public health
arguments. Support centered on
individual responsibility and
patriotism.

Sentiment analysis showed that a
predominantly negative feeling
toward COVID-19 pandemic.
Topic modeling revealed 3 themes
relating to COVID-19 and the
outbreak: the COVID-19 pandemic
emergency, how to control
COVID-19, and reports on
COVID-19.
Nearly 10-fold increase at the
national level.
All 50 states witnessed an increase
in the number of tweets
exclusively mentioning “Chinese
virus” or “China virus” instead of
coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
or coronavirus.
On average, 0.38 tweets
referencing “Chinese virus” or
“China virus” were posted per
10,000 people at the state level in
the preperiod, and 4.08 of these
stigmatizing tweets were posted in
the postperiod, also indicating a
10-fold increase.
Social network size was a negative
predictor of incivility.

Online news served as a hotbed for
negativity and for driving
emotional social posts.
Stigmatizing language linked to
the COVID-19 pandemic shows a
lack of civic responsibility that
encourages bias, hostility, and
discrimination.

Reddit users were generally more

Democrats discussed the crisis
more frequently–emphasizing

Level of stress decreased, and the
attention to leisure increased in
Lombardy after the lockdown.
Attention to group, religion, and
emotions became more prevalent
in Wuhan after the lockdown.
The results show that females are
more likely to tweet about the
virus in the context of family,
social distancing and healthcare,
whereas males are more likely to
tweet about sports cancellations,
the global spread of the virus, and
political reactions.
People concern 4 aspects regarding
COVID-19:
a) The virus Origin
b) Symptom
c) Production Activity
d) Public Health Control

While the FAMILY frame covers a
wider portion of the corpus, among
the figurative frames WAR, a
highly conventional one, is the
frame used most frequently.
Yet, this frame does not seem to be
apt to elaborate the discourse
around some aspects involved in
the current situation.
6 themes were identified. The most
prominent theme was

23%).
The theme “Contributing to the
community” was the most
dominant in the first phase
(January 20–February 20 as the
period of COVID-19 outbreak in
China).
The “Older patients in hospitals”
theme was most dominant in the
second (February 21–March 17 as
the turnover period) and third
phase (March 18–April 28 as the
post-peak period in China).
Both the BAI and GT indices
showed a similar trend in a slightly
different way.
Daily GT was correlated to 7
indicators, whereas daily BAI was
only correlated to 3 indicators.
These indexes and rumors are
statistically related to diseaserelated indicators.
Information symmetry was also
found.
9 themes about family violence
were identified.

Social media analytics is an
efficient approach to capture
attitudes and perceptions of the
public during a pandemic.

can guide interventions and
decisions of the authorities during
a pandemic.

media channels can help the public
to follow the introduced measures/
restrictions.

process is divided into 3 periods:
pre-crisis, lockdown, and recovery
period.
Understand how Spanish news
media cover public health crises on
social media platforms
The trend of public attention can
be divided into 3 stages.
The hot topic keywords of public
attention at each stage were
slightly different.
The emotional tendency of the
public toward the COVID-19
epidemic-related hot topics
changed from negative to neutral,
with negative emotions weakening
and positive emotions increasing
as a whole.
Divided the COVID-19 topics with
the most public concern into 5
categories: the situation of the new
cases of COVID-19 and its impact,
