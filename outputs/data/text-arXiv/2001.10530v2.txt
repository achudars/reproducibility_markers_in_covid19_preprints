Abstract
Objectives: To estimate the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019nCoV).
Methods: Based on the susceptible–exposed–infected–removed (SEIR) compartment model and
the assumption that the infectious cases with symptoms occurred before 26 January, 2020 are
resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the basic reproduction number of
2019-nCoV according to the reported confirmed cases and suspected cases, as well as the theoretical
estimated number of infected cases by other research teams, together with some epidemiological
determinants learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome.
Results: The basic reproduction number fall between 2.8 to 3.3 by using the real-time reports on
the number of 2019-nCoV infected cases from People's Daily in China and fall between 3.2 and 3.9
on the basis of the predicted number of infected cases from international colleagues. Using a newly
reported epidemiological determinants for early 2019-nCoV, the estimated basic reproduction
number is in the range [2.2,3.0].
Conclusions: The early transmission ability of 2019-nCoV is close to or slightly higher than SARS.
It is a controllable disease with moderate-high transmissibility. Timely and effective control
measures are needed to suppress the further transmissions.
Keywords: 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV); basic reproduction number; epidemiology

Introduction
The transmission of pneumonia associated with the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originated in
Wuhan city has not yet been effectively blocked. In the meanwhile, the number of confirmed and
suspected cases is increasing rapidly. Estimating the epidemiological determinants of 2019-nCoV
is significant and urgent regarding the assessment of epidemic transmissibility, the prediction of
future trend of epidemic spreading, as well as the design of control measures. The basic reproduction
number is the most important parameter to determine the intrinsic transmissibility, defined as the
average number of secondary infectious cases generated by an index case in a completely
susceptible population without any interventions [1]. During the outbreak of an epidemic, due to
interventions and control measures from government, reaction of personal behaviors (sterilizing,
wearing masks, washing hands, reducing contacts, etc.), the depletion of susceptible populations,
and the seasonality of transmissibility, the basic reproduction number is generalized to the effective
reproduction number, which is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by an
infectious case at time t, and is denoted by Rt. The epidemic is considered to be under control when
Rt<1.
We assumed that the infected individuals whose onset time of symptoms no later than January 25,
2020 were resulted from the free propagation, i.e., the transmission was without interventions.
Regarding the reports of real-time data of 2019-nCoV situation jointed by the People's Daily in
China [2] and DXY.cn (an online community for health care professionals) [3], as well as the
estimated number of 2019-nCoV infections from the research group led by the Northeastern
University [4] (these two data sources are later abbreviated as People’s Daily Reports and
Northeastern University Reports), we estimated the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV based
on the susceptible–exposed–infected–removed (SEIR) compartment model.
Methods
This article was intended to estimate the basic reproduction number under the situation of free
propagation, which was the initial stage of the spread of 2019-nCoV without the interventions. Most
Chinese people were aware of the outbreak of 2019-nCoV by the mainstream media after 20 January
2020. The Hubei government released the announcement about strengthening the prevention and
control measures against 2019-nCoV, and launched the second-level public health emergency
response at 2:40am on 22 January, 2020. Thus, the public awareness and effective interventions
were absent when the time was prior to this point. As the median value of the incubation period of
SARS was 6.4 days (95% CI 5.2 to 7.7 days) [5], and the 2019-nCoV incubation period was 5.1
days according to a recent report on a few confirmed cases [6], we inferred that the confirmed cases
before 26 January, 2020 were infected during the free propagation of 2019-nCoV. Meanwhile, the
confirmed cases after 25 January were not suitable for the analyses since the cases were generated
in the following days were not during the free propagation.
We used the susceptible–exposed–infected–removed (SEIR) compartment model [7] to
characterize the early spreading of 2019-nCoV, where each individual could be in one of the
following four states: susceptible (S), exposed (E, being infected but without infectiousness),
infected (I, with infectiousness) and removed (R). At each time step (in days in later analyses), a
susceptible individual would turn to be an exposed individual with probability  if she/he

contacts with an infected individual, an exposed individual had a probability
infected, and an infected would be removed with probability

1

to become

 2 . The dynamical process of SEIR

thus could be described as
𝑑𝑆(𝑡)
𝛽𝑆(𝑡)𝐼(𝑡)
=−
𝑑𝑡
𝑁
𝑑𝐸(𝑡) 𝛽𝑆(𝑡)𝐼(𝑡)
=
− 𝛾1 𝐸(𝑡)
𝑑𝑡
𝑁
𝑑𝐼(𝑡)
= 𝛾1 𝐸(𝑡) − 𝛾2 𝐼(𝑡)
𝑑𝑡
𝑑𝑅(𝑡)
= 𝛾2 𝐼(𝑡)
𝑑𝑡
where S(t)、E(t)、I(t) and R(t) respectively represent the number of individuals in the susceptible,
exposed, infectious and recovered states at time t, N was the total number of individuals in the
system such that N=S(t)+E(t)+I(t)+R(t). The infected population during early transmission was
negligible compared with the total population, that was, when t approaches 0, S(t) approaches to N.
The basic reproduction number could then be approximated as [8]:
𝜆
𝜆
𝑅0 = (1 + )(1 + )
𝛾1
𝛾2
where  = ln Y (t ) t was the growth rate of the early exponential growth and Y (t ) was the
number of infected people with symptom by time t. The exposed period and the infection period
and

TI = 1  2 , Generation time could then be approximated as

Tg = TE + TI . Denote by  = TE Tg

the ratio of exposed period to generation time, the basic

could be expressed as

TE = 1  1

reproduction number could be rewritten as

R0 = 1 + Tg +  (1 −  )(Tg )2 .
Results
To estimate R0, the parameters

, 

and

Tg

were needed, where



was determined by

Y (t ) . Below was the detailed discussion about these three parameters.
According to the real-time dynamic data of 2019-nCoV by the People's Daily Reports, there were
1408 confirmed cases and 2032 suspected cases by the time of 23:59 on 25 January 2020. In reality,
there should be a certain fraction of infected people with symptoms having not been found [4,9,10].
If we ignored this situation and suppose that there a fraction q of the suspected cases would be
confirmed further (on the basis of an early report that 41 of the 59 suspected cases were eventually
confirmed, the reference value of q was 41/59=0.695), then the number of cases with symptoms on
25 January was Y (t ) = 2032  0.695 + 1408 = 2820 . Note that, the real number of cases was
probably much larger than 2820. We considered this number as the optimistic situation (the lower
bound of the number of cases having onset of symptoms). If we took the Northeastern University
Reports [4] as the reference, there would be about 4 050 cases on 20 January 2020, and about 12

700 cases on 24 January, 2020. This result was mainly based on the number of confirmed cases in
overseas which were exported from Wuhan. Even though there might be a large bias due to the
highly limited samples, it should be seriously considered as all other methods were also very
preliminary and some reports [9,10] showed similar results to the Northeastern University Reports
[4]. Read et al. [10] inferred that the actual number of confirmed cases was only 5.1%, including
the cases without symptoms. If only 5% of symptomatic infections were detected (more pessimistic
than the results of Read’s study [10]), then according to the confirmed cases (1 408) by 25 January,
the number of cases with symptoms was 28 160, ten times larger than the optimistic one. We used
it as the upper bound of Y(t) in sensitivity analysis. We set the date 8 December 2019, the presence
time of the first pneumonia of unknown aetiology, as t=0. In fact, t might be slightly earlier than 8
December, since the symptoms might have appeared for some time before to the hospital. Hence,
the estimated basic reproduction number might be a bit higher by using 8 December 2019 as t=0.
Based on the above analysis, we mainly used Y(48)=2 820 from the People's Daily Reports, and
Y(43)=4 050, Y(47)=12 700 form the Northeastern University Reports [4].
The value of  for SARS was in the range of [0.5, 0.8], we took  = 0.65 in the absence of
more references [5][11]. In the sensitivity analysis, we would consider  from 0.5 to 1. As the
formula  (1 −  ) was symmetry, the range, i.e., [0.5, 1], covers all possible values of  .
Lipsitch et al. [12] showed that the average of
outbreaks

Tg

Tg

is 8.4 days for SARS, while in the early

was higher (the average value was 10.0 days), and they suggested the sensitivity

analysis interval as

Tg  [8,12] . Imai et al. [13] claimed that the case study reported in Chan’s

research [6] indicated that 2019-nCoV has a much shorter Tg . However, we could not yet obtain
any solid estimation about the value of

Tg

as the number of samples was too small the

questionnary survey did not sufficiently cover the interests about genration time. Therefore, we
mainly concentrated on

Tg = 8.4 (days) and Tg = 10.0

(days), and took sensitivity analysis with

the same interval [10, 14] as suggested by Lipsitch et al [12].

As shown in Table 1, the basic reproduction number fall between 2.8 to 3.3 based on the People's
Daily Reports and fall between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the Northeastern University Reports [4].
The estimated value of R0 by the Reports of the Northeastern University was similar to the value

estimated by Read et al. [10], which was in the range of [3.6, 4.0]. Our estimated values were higher
than the ones ([2.1, 3.5], with a median value 2.6) by Imai et al. [13]. In accordance with the
currently preliminary estimations, the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV was close to SARS. For
example, the basic reproduction number of SARS by Lipsitch et al. [12] was [2.2, 3.6], and the
average basic reproduction number of SARS by Riely et al. [14] was 2.7 (95%CI 2.2 to 3.7), but if
considering the superspreading events, this average value rised up to 3.4. The basic reproduction
number of SARS by Wallinga and Teunis [15] was from 3.1 to 4.2, which was not lower than our
pessimistic result. Therefore, if we rely on the People's Daily Reports, the basic reproduction
number of 2019-nCoV was not higher than SARS, or even slightly lower than the basic reproduction
number of SARS predicted by some other research teams. Even with the more predictions by the
Northeastern University Reports, the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV was only slightly
higher than SARS. It was a controllable disease with moderate-high transmissibility. Concerning
the previous experiences in fighting with SARS, the spreading of 2019-nCoV could be quickly
reduced (probably in two or three weeks) through timely and effective control measures by
government

Figure 1 showed the sensitivity analysis of the three key parameters. Under the worst case
( Y (48) = 28016 ,  = 0.5 , Tg

= 12 ), the estimated R0 was 5.2; under the best case ( Y (48) = 2820 ,

 = 1.0 , Tg = 8 ), the estimated R0 was 2.3. Because R0 was sensitive to the generation time, with
the accumulation of epidemiological survey data, the estimation of generation time would be more
accurate, thus providing a more precise estimation of the basic reproduction number.
Discussion
Considering the extreme cases, the basic reproduction number was in the range [2.3, 5.2], but we
thought it should be in the range [2.8, 3.9]. Based on the data of the People's Daily Reports, the
prediction of the basic reproduction number was in the range of 2.8 and 3.3, and this range became
[3.2, 3.9] when the data was based on the Reports the Northeastern University [4]. Even with the
pessimistic estimation, the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV was only slightly higher than
SARS, fully equipped with controllable condition. Many known basic reproduction numbers were
higher than 2019-nCoV. For example, Zika virus was 1.4-6.6 [16], Middle East respiratory
syndrome was 2.0-6.7 [17], and smallpox was 3.5-6.0 [18]. In a word, 2019-nCoV does not have
particularly outstanding transmissibility.
The value of basic reproduction number was most sensitive to the generation time

Tg , and thus

we hope the more accurate estimation of the generation time based on the accumulation of
epidemiological survey data would further improve the quality of the estimation of R0. The number
of confirmed cases obtained from different sources varied widely. Since a significant proportion of
patients with 2019-nCoV had mild symptoms, which could be healed without entering the hospital,
there might be a large number of patients not in the official confirmed list. Consequently, we
suggested to be more prudent. For example, the design of control measure should refer to the more
pessimistic estimation (based on the Northeastern University Reports) rather than the more
optimistic one (based on the People's Daily Reports). Our model assumes that the individuals in
exposed state did not have or have very lower-level infectiousness (according to SARS), however,
it was possible that for 2019-nCoV, individuals in the exposed state still had considerable
infectiousness. Such possible difference was already taken into account by varying the value of  .
It was needed to be emphasized that the method used in this article was a preliminary estimation
under the premise of largely insufficient data. In order to have a better estimation of the basic
reproduction number and effective reproduction number, as well as predicting the trend of epidemic
transmission, we not only need to know precise epidemiological determinants, but also need to
improve the model itself by further considering the diversity in susceptibilities and contact
probabilities of people in different ages and genders, the different spreading mechanisms in hospitals
and communities, the effects of regional population density and human mobility, and so on [19-22].
From the dynamic perspective,

R0 = k  D , where k was the average number of contacts to

susceptible individuals of an infected individual per day,  was the transmission probability
through a contact between an infected individual and a susceptible individual, and D was the

effective time period allowing an infected individual to infect susceptible individuals. The
government’s control policy and individuals’ prevention behaviors were to reduce these parameters,
and to eventually make the effective reproduction number Rt below 1. According to our results, if
k  D could be reduced by 3/4 (to its 1/4), 2019-nCoV could be effectively controlled. Staying at
home and cancelled meetings could decrease the frequency of contacts between infected and
susceptible individuals. Wearing masks and washing hands could reduce the transmission
probability  . If the individuals exhibit the suspected symptoms or have contacts with the highrisk groups, the corresponding medical observation and the isolation with other individuals were
needed, which would shorten the effective infectious time period D. Restrictions on transportation,
extension of winter holiday, and the cancellation of various conferences also aimed at reducing the
effective reproductive number. Based on the preliminary information, a considerable amount of
people infected with 2019-nCoV only show mild symptoms, and thus they had the same mobility
as healthy people in principle. There were also some preliminary epidemiological findings
suggesting that infected cases had infectiousness during the exposed period. These reasons, together
with the delayed responses by Wuhan government, lead to a fiercer outbreak of 2019-nCoV than
SARS. On the contrary, reducing the traveling and avoiding the meetings, in the meanwhile, wearing
masks and washing hands frequently would suppress the effects caused by mild symptoms and
exposed state with infectiousness. Relying on the Chinese experiences in fighting with SARS, we
believed that 2019-nCoV would be effectively controlled soon.
In conclusion, the SEIR model is employed to describe the dynamical process of 2019-nCoV
spreading, and based on the collected data of 2019-nCoV, the basic reproduction number is predicted
in this article a little higher than the SARS, which suggests that 2019-nCoV is of a moderate-high
transmissibility. In order to control the further extension of 2019-nCoV quickly, more effective and
timely control measures are required. In the process of prediction, some parameters related to the
early stage of SARS transmission were used, and meanwhile it shows that the basic reproduction
number is a little sensitive to the generation time. Thus, the microscopic survey about the
transmission processes is needed to further improve the quality of predictions.
Notes Added. Two days after uploading the first version to arXiv, we are aware of a newly online
published article [23] that has directly estimated some epidemiological determinants based on the
425 early confirmed cases in Wuhan. In particular, they suggested the mean serial interval as 7.5
days (95%CI 5.3 to 19), and the mean incubation period as 5.2 days (95%CI 4.1 to 7.0). Taking their
data as reference (since some infections may be unreported, their estimated number also suffers
possible bias, but we believe it should be more accurate than using the empirical values from SARS),
the ratio should be

 = 0.693 instead of  = 0.65 (we still assume that the individual

infectivity in the incubation period is much smaller than that in the infected period), and the serial
interval should be Tg = 7.5 while the values we considered in this work is larger, as Tg = 8.4
and Tg = 10.0 . If we still use the People’s Daily Reports, say Y(48)=2820, then the predicted basic
reproduction number is R0=2.2, and if we use the Northeastern University Reports, say Y(43)=4050
and Y(47)=12700, then the predicted basic reproduction numbers are R0=2.9 and R0=3.0. The worst
case we considered in the parameter sensitivity analysis, say Y(48)=28016, leads to R0=3.1.

Therefore, using the updated data for 2019-nCoV, we predict the basic reproduction number is in
between 2.2 and 3.0. Notice that, the updated prediction is smaller than our previous prediction
mainly because of a shorter serial interval. However, this smaller number of R0 does not indicate a
more controllable situation because shorter serial interval at the same time means faster propagation.
