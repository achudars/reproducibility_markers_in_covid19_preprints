Abstract
Raw data on the cumulative number of deaths at a country level generally indicate a spatially variable distribution of the incidence of COVID-19 disease. An important issue is to
determine whether this spatial pattern is a consequence of environmental heterogeneities, such
as the climatic conditions, during the course of the outbreak. Another fundamental issue is
to understand the spatial spreading of COVID-19. To address these questions, we consider
four candidate epidemiological models with varying complexity in terms of initial conditions,
contact rates and non-local transmissions, and we fit them to French mortality data with a
mixed probabilistic-ODE approach. Using standard statistical criteria, we select the model
with non-local transmission corresponding to a diffusion on the graph of counties that depends
on the geographic proximity, with time-dependent contact rate and spatially constant parameters. This original spatially parsimonious model suggests that in a geographically middle
size centralized country such as France, once the epidemic is established, the effect of global
processes such as restriction policies, sanitary measures and social distancing overwhelms the
effect of local factors. Additionally, this modeling approach reveals the latent epidemiological
dynamics including the local level of immunity, and allows us to evaluate the role of non-local
interactions on the future spread of the disease. In view of its theoretical and numerical simplicity and its ability to accurately track the COVID-19 epidemic curves, the framework we
develop here, in particular the non-local model and the associated estimation procedure, is of
general interest in studying spatial dynamics of epidemics.

Introduction

In France, the first cases of COVID-19 epidemic have been reported on 24 January 2020, although
it appeared latter that some cases were already present in December 2019 [1]. Since then, the first
1

important clusters were observed in February in the Grand Est region and the Paris region. A few
months later, at the beginning of June, the spatial pattern of the disease spread seems to have kept
track of these first introductions. As this spatial pattern may also be correlated with covariates
such as climate [2] (see also SI 1), a fundamental question is to assess whether this pattern is the
consequence of a heterogeneous distribution of some covariates or if it can be explained by the
heterogeneity of the initial introduction points. In the latter case, we want to know if the epidemic
dynamics simply reflects this initial heterogeneity and can be modeled without taking into account
any spatial heterogeneity in the local conditions.
SIR epidemiological models and their extensions have been proposed to study the spread of the
COVID-19 epidemic at the country or state scale (e.g., [3] in France and [4] in three US states),
and at the regional scale ([5, 6] in China, [7] in France and [8] in Italy). In all cases, a different
set of parameters has been estimated for each considered region/province. One of the main goals
of our study is to check whether the local mortality data at a thin spatial scale can still be well
explained by a single set of parameters, at the country scale, but spatially varying initial conditions.
In this study we consider SIR models with time-dependent contact rate, to track changes over time
in the dynamic reproductive number as in the branching process considered in [4]. Using standard
statistical criteria, we compare four types of models, whose parameters are either global at the
country scale or spatially heterogeneous, and with non-local transmission or not. We work with
mortality data only, as these data appear to be more reliable and less dependent on local testing
strategies than confirmed cases, in settings where cause of death is accurately determined [9].
Additionally, it was already shown that for this type of data, SIR models outperform other classes
of models (an SEIR models and a branching process) in the three US states considered in [4].
The approach we develop here is in line with the general principle of using parsimonious models
eloquently emphasized in [4].
Another important issue that such models may help to address is the quantification of the
relative effects of restrictions on inter-regional travels, vs reductions in the probability of infection
per contact at the local scale. France went into lockdown on March 17, 2020, which was found
to be very effective in reducing the spread of the disease. It divided the effective reproduction
number (number Rt of secondary cases generated by an infectious individual) by a factor 5 to
7 at the country scale by May 11 [10, 7]. This is to be compared with the estimate of the basic
reproduction number R0 carried out in France at the early onset of the epidemic, before the country
went into lockdown (with values R0 = 2.96 in [7] and R0 = 3.2 in [3]). Contact-surveys data [11]
for Wuhan and Shanghai, China, have found comparable estimates of the reduction factor. The
national lockdown in France induced important restrictions on movement, with e.g. a mandatory
home confinement except for essential journeys, leading to a reduction of the number of contacts.
In parallel, generalized mask wearing and use of hydroalcoholic gels reduced the probability of
infection per contact.
After the lockdown, restrictions policies were generally based on raw data rather than modeling.
An efficient regulation at the local scale would need to know the current number of infectious and the
level of immunity at the scale of counties. The French territory is divided into administrative units
called ‘départements’, analogous to counties. We use ’counties’ in the sequel for départements.
These quantities cannot be observed directly in the absence of large scale testing campaigns or
spatial random sampling. In particular, there is a large number of unreported cases. Previous
studies developed a mixed mechanistic-probabilistic framework to estimate these quantities at the
country scale. These involved estimating the relative probability of getting tested for an infected
individual vs a healthy individual, leading to a factor x8 between the number of confirmed cases and

2

the actual number of cases before the lockdown [3], and x20 at the end of the lockdown period [10].
This type of framework – often referred to as ‘mechanistic-statistical modeling’ – aims at connecting
the solution of continuous state models such as differential equations with complex data, such as
noisy discrete data, and identifying latent processes such as the epidemiological process under
consideration here. Initially introduced for physical models and data [12], it is becoming standard
in ecology [13].
Using this framework the objectives of our study are (i) to assess whether the spatial pattern
observed in France is due do some local covariates or is simply the consequence of the heterogeneity
in the initial conditions together with global processes at the country scale; (ii) to evaluate the role
of non-local interactions on the spread of the disease; (iii) to propose a tool for real-time monitoring
the main components of the disease in France, with a particular focus on the local level of immunity.

Materials and Methods
Data
Mainland France (excluding Corsica island) is made of 94 counties called ’départements’. The daily
number of hospital deaths – excluding nursing homes – at the county scale are available from Sant
Publique France since 18 March 2020 (and available as Supplementary Material). The daily number
of observed deaths (still excluding nursing homes) in county k during day t is denoted by µ̂k,t .
We denote by [ti , tf ] the observation period and by nd the number of considered counties. To
avoid a too large number of counties with 0 deaths at initial time, the observation period ranges
from ti = March 30 to tf = June 11, corresponding to nt = 74 days of observation. All the counties
of mainland France (excluding Corsica) are taken into account, but the Ile-de-France region, which
is made of 8 counties with a small area is considered as a single geographic entity. This leads to
nd = 87.

Mechanistic-statistical framework
The mechanistic-statistical framework is a combination of a mechanistic model that describes the
epidemiological process, a probabilistic observation model and a statistical inference procedure.
We begin with the description of four mechanistic models, whose main characteristics are given in
Table 1.
Mechanistic models

with S the susceptible population, I the infectious population, R the recovered population, D
the number of deaths due to the epidemic and N the total population, in the whole country.
For simplicity, we assume that N is constant, equal to the current population in France, thereby
neglecting the effect of the small variations of the population on the coefficient α(t)/N . The
parameter α(t) is the contact rate (to be estimated) and 1/β is the mean time until an infectious
becomes recovered. The results in [14] show that the median period of viral shedding is 20 days,
but the infectiousness tends to decay before the end of this period: the results in [15] indicate that
infectiousness starts from 2.5 days before symptom onset and declines within 7 days of illness onset.
Based on these observations we assume here that 1/β = 10 days. The parameter γ corresponds to
the death rate of the infectious. It was estimated independently in [3, 10] and [7], leading to a value
γ = 5 · 10−4 . This value only takes into account the deaths at hospital, and is therefore consistent
with the data that we used here.
Model M1 : SIR model at the county scale with globally constant contact rate and
no spatial transmission. The model M0 is applied at the scale of each county k, leading to
compartments Sk , Ik , Rk , Dk that satisfy an equation of the form (1), with N replaced by Nk , the
total population in the county k. In this approach, the contact rate α(t) is assumed to be the same
in all of the counties.
Model M2 : SIR model at the county scale with spatially heterogeneous contact rate
and no spatial transmission. With this approach, the model M1 is extended by assuming that
the contact rate αk (t) depends on the considered county.
Model M3 : County scale model with globally constant contact rate and spatial transmission. The model M1 is extended to take into account disease transmission events between
the counties:

The weights wj,k describe the dependence of the contagion rates with respect to the distance between
counties. We assume a power law decay with the distance:
wj,k =

1
,
1 + (dist(j, k)/d0 )δ

(3)

with dist(j, k) the geographic distance (in km) between the centroids of counties j and k, d0 > 0
a proximity scale, and δ > 0. Thus, the model involves two new global parameters, d0 and δ,
compared to model M1 . This model extends the Kermack-McKendrick SIR model to take into
account non-local spatial interactions. It was introduced by Kendall [16] in continuous variables.
The model we adopt here is inspired from the study of [17] in a different context where the same
types of weights have been used. We thus take into account diffusion on the weighted graph of
counties in France. This amounts to considering that individuals in a given county are infected
by individuals form other counties with a probability that decreases with distance as a power law,
in addition to contagious individuals from their own county. This dependence of social spatial
interactions with respect to the distance is supported, notably, by [18] that analyzed the short-time
dispersal of bank notes in the US. We also refer to [19] for a thorough discussion on the various
applications of power law dispersal kernels since they were introduced by Pareto [20].
With this non-local contagion model, in contradistinction to epidemiological models with dispersion such as reaction-diffusion epidemiological models [21], the movements of the individuals are
not modeled explicitly. The model implicitly assumes that infectious individuals may transmit the
disease to susceptible individuals in other counties, but eventually return to their county of origin.
This has the advantage of avoiding unrealistic changes in the global population density.
Observation model
We denote by Dk (t) the expected cumulative number of deaths given by the model, in county
k. With the mean-field model M0 , we assume that it is proportional to the population size:
Dk (t) = D(t) Nk /N, with Nk the population in county k and N the total French population. With
models M1 , M2 and M3 , we simply have Dk (t) = Dk (t). The expected daily increment in the
number of deaths given by the models in a county k is Dk (t) − Dk (t − 1).
The observation model assumes that the daily number of new observed deaths µ̂k,t in county k
follows a Poisson distribution with mean value Dk (t) − Dk (t − 1):
µ̂k,t ∼ Poisson(Dk (t) − Dk (t − 1)).

(4)

Note that the time t in the mechanistic models is a continuous variable, while the observations µ̂k,t
are reported at discrete times. For the sake of simplicity, we used the same notation t for the days
in both the discrete and continuous cases. In the formula (4) Dk (t) (resp. Dk (t − 1)) is computed
at the end of day t (resp. t − 1).

Initial conditions
In models M1 , M2 , M3 , at initial time ti , we assume that the number of susceptible cases is equal
to the number of inhabitants in county k: Sk (ti ) = Nk , the number of recovered is R(ti ) = 0 and
the number of deaths is given by the data: Dk (ti ) = µ̂k,ti . To initialise the number of infectious,
we use the equation D0 (t) = γ I(t), and we define I(ti ) as 1/γ × (mean number of deaths over the

5

period ranging from ti to 29 days after ti ):
Ik (ti ) =

The 30-days window was chosen such that there was at least one infectious case in each county.
In model M0 , the initial conditions are obtained by adding the initial conditions of model M1 (or
equivalently, M2 ) over all the counties.

Statistical inference
Real-time monitoring of the parameters and data assimilation procedure. To smooth
out the effect of small variations in the data, and to avoid identifiability issues due to the large
number of parameters, while keeping the temporal dependence of the parameters, the parameters
α(t) and αk (t) of the ODE models M0 , M1 , M2 are estimated by fitting auxiliary problems with
time-constant parameters over moving windows (t − τ /2, t + τ /2) of fixed duration equal to τ days.
These auxiliary problems are denoted respectively by M̃0,t , M̃1,t , and M̃2,t (see SI 2 for a precise
formulation of these problems). The initial conditions associated with this system, at the date
t − τ /2 are computed iteratively from the solution of M0 , M1 and M2 , respectively.
Inference procedure.

For simplicity, in all cases, we denote by

fDk ,µ̂k (s) :=

(Dk (s) − Dk (s − 1))µ̂k,s −(Dk (s)−Dk (s−1))
e
µ̂k,s !

the probability mass function associated with the observation process (4) at date s in county k,
given the expected cumulative number of deaths Dk given by the considered model in county k.
In models M̃0,t and M̃1,t , the estimated parameter is α̃. The likelihood L is defined as the
probability of the observations (here, the increments {µ̂k,s }) conditionally on the parameter. Using
the assumption that the increments µ̂k,s are independent conditionally on the underlying SIRD
process M̃0,t (resp. M̃1,t ), we get:
L(α̃) := P ({µ̂k,s , k = 1, . . . , nd , s = t − τ /2, . . . , t + τ /2}|α̃)

We denote by α̃t∗ the corresponding maximum likelihood estimator, and we set α(t) = α̃t∗ in model M0 (resp. M1 ).
For model M̃2,t , the inference of the parameters α̃k is carried out independently in each county,
leading to the likelihoods:

For model M3 , we apply a two-stage estimation approach. We first use the estimate obtained
with model M1 by setting ρ(t) = C α(t), where α(t) is the estimated contact rate of model M1
and C is a constant (to be estimated; note that estimating ρ(t) means estimating nt parameters).
Thus, given α(t), the only parameters to be estimated are the constant C, the proximity scale d0
and the exponent δ. They are estimated by maximizing:
L(C, d0 , δ) := P ({µ̂k,s , k = 1, . . . , nd , s = ti , tf }|C, d0 , δ)

Model selection. We use the Akaike information criterion (AIC) [22] and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) [23] to compare the models. For both criteria, we need to compute the

(Mm ). Given the number of parameters ]Mm estimated in model Mm , the AIC score is defined
as follows:
AIC(Mm ) = 2 ]Mm − 2 ln(L(Mm )),
and the BIC score:
BIC(Mm ) = ]Mm ln(K) − 2 ln(L(Mm )),
with K = nd × nt = 6 438 the number of data points.
Numerical methods. To find the maximum likelihood estimator, we used a BFGS constrained
minimization algorithm, applied to − ln(L) via the Matlab ® function fmincon. The ODEs were
solved thanks to a standard numerical algorithm, using Matlab® ode45 solver. The Matlab ® codes
are available as Supplementary Material.

Results
Model fit and model selection. To assess model fit, we compared the daily increments in the number
of deaths given by each of the four models with the data. For each model, we used the parameters
corresponding to the maximum likelihood estimators. The comparisons are carried out at the
regional scale: mainland France is divided into 12 administrative regions, each of which is made of
several counties. The results are presented in Fig. 1. In all the regions, the models M1 , M2 and
M3 lead to a satisfactory visual fit of the data, whereas the mean field model M0 does not manage
to reproduce the variability of the dynamics among the regions.
The log-likelihood, AIC and BIC values are given in Table 2. Models M1 , M2 , M3 lead to
significantly higher likelihood values than model M0 . This reflects the better fit obtained with these
three models, compared to model M0 and shows the importance of taking into account the spatial

heterogeneities in the initial densities of infectious cases. On the other hand, the log-likelihood,
though higher with model M2 is close to that obtained with M1 , and the model selection criteria
are both strongly in favor of model M1 . This shows that the spatial heterogeneity in the contact
rate does not have a significant effect on the epidemic dynamics within mainland France.
Model M3 with spatial transmission leads to an intermediate likelihood value, between those
of models M1 and M2 , with only 2 additional parameters with respect to model M1 . As a
consequence, the model selection criteria exhibit a strong evidence in favor of the selection of model
M3 . This means a large part of the difference between models M1 and M2 can be captured by
taking into account the spatial transmission, which therefore seems to have a significant effect on
the epidemic dynamics.
As a byproduct of the estimation of the parameter α(t) (resp. αk (t)) of model M1 (resp. M2 ),
we get an estimate of the effective reproduction number in each county, which is given by the
formula [24]:
α(t) Sk (t)
,
Rkt =
β + γ Nk
so that Ik0 (t) < 0 (the epidemic tends to vanish) whenever Rkt < 1, whereas Ik0 (t) > 0 whenever
Rkt > 1 (the number of infectious cases in the population follows an increasing trend). The dynamics
of Rkt obtained with model M1 are depicted in Fig. 2, clearly showing a decline in Rkt , as already
observed in [10, 7], but there the computation was at a fixed date.
For model M3 , the maximum likelihood estimation gives C = 0.87, d0 = 2.16 km and δ = 1.85,
which yields a nearly quadratic decay of the weights with the distance. The value of d0 , indicates
that non-local contagion plays a secondary role compared to within-county contagion: the minimum
distance between two counties is 36 km, leading to a weight of 5.5/1000, to be compared with the
weight 1 for within-county contagion. However, the fact that the parameter C is significantly
smaller than 1 (recall that the contact rate in model M3 is ρ(t) = C α(t) with α(t) the contact rate
in model M2 ) shows that the non-local contagion term plays an important role on the spreading
of the epidemic.
Immunity rate. Using model M3 , which leads to the best fit, we derive the number of recovered
individuals (considered here as immune) at a date t, in each county, and the immunity rate Rk /Nk .
It is presented at time tf in Fig. 3. The full timeline of the dynamics of immunity obtained with
model M3 since the beginning of April is available as Supplementary Material (see SI 1).
Limiting movement vs limiting the probability of transmission per contact. Before the lockdown,
the basic reproduction number R0 in France was about 3 [7, 3], and was then reduced by a factor

5 to 7, leading to values around 0.5 (see [10, 7] and Fig. 2). This corresponds to a contact rate
α(t) ≈ β Rt ≈ 0.3 before the lockdown and α(t) ≈ 0.05 after the lockdown in model M1 . Let us
now consider a hypothetical scenario of a new outbreak with an effective reproduction number that
rises again to reach values above 1. Due to the higher awareness of the population with respect
to epidemic diseases and the new sanitary behaviors induced by the first COVID-19 wave, the
reproduction number will probably not reach again values as high as 3.
The new outbreak scenario is described as follows: we start from the state of the epidemic
at June 11, and we assume a ’local’ contact rate ρ(t) jumping to the value 0.11 in model M3
(corresponding to a 2-fold increase compared to the previous 30 days). In parallel, to describe the
lifting of restrictions on individual movements, we set d0 = 20 km for the proximity scale in model
M3 . This new outbreak runs during 10 days, and then, we test four strategies:
- Strategy 1: no restriction. The parameters remain unchanged: ρ(t) = 0.11 and d0 = 20 km;
- Strategy 2: restriction on intercounty movement. The parameter ρ(t) = 0.11 is unchanged,
but d0 = 2.16 km, corresponding to its estimated value during the period (ti , tf );
- Strategy 3: reduction of the contact rate within each county (e.g., by wearing masks), but no
restriction on intercounty movement: ρ(t) = 0.05 and d0 = 20 km;
- Strategy 4: reduction of the contact rate within each county and restriction on intercounty
movement: ρ(t) = 0.05 and d0 = 2.16 km.
The daily number of deaths corresponding to each scenario is presented in Fig. 4. We estimate in
each case a value of the effective reproduction number Rt over the whole country by fitting the global
number of infectious cases with an exponential function over the last 30 days. As expected, the more
restrictive the strategy, the less the number of deaths. After 30 days, the cumulative number of
deaths with the first strategy is 17 271, and Rt ≈ 2. Restriction on intercounty movement (strategy
2) leads to a 81% decrease in the cumulative number of deaths (3 281 deaths) and Rt ≈ 1.2; reducing
the contact rate within each county leads to a 88% decrease (strategy 3, 2 139 deaths) and Rt ≈ 0.8;
finally, control strategy 4, which combines both types of restrictions leads to a 91% decrease (1 503
deaths) and Rt ≈ 0.4.

Discussion
We show here that a parsimonious model can reproduce the local dynamics of the COVID-19
epidemic in France with a relatively high goodness of fit. This is achieved despite the spatial heterogeneity across French counties of some environmental factors potentially influencing the disease
propagation. Indeed, our model only involves the initial spatial distribution of the infectious cases
and spatially-homogeneous (i.e. countrywide) parameters. For instance, the mean temperature
during the considered period ranges from 12.0°C to 18.4°C depending on the region. We do observe
a negative correlation between the mean temperature and the immunity rate (see Fig. S1), however
it does not reflect a causality. Actually, our study shows that if there is an effect of local covariates
such as the mean temperature on the spread of the disease once it emerged, its effect is of lower
importance compared to the global processes at work at the country scale. Such covariates might
play a major role in the emergence of the disease, but our work focuses on the disease dynamics
after the emergence.

Hence, we find that initial conditions and spatial diffusion are the main drivers of the spatial
pattern of the COVID-19 epidemic. This result may rely on specific circumstances: e.g., mainland
France covers a relatively middle-sized area, with mixed urban and countryside populations across
the territory, a relatively homogeneous population age distribution, and a high level of centralism
for public decision (in particular regarding the disease-control strategy). Of course, these features
are not universal. In other countries with more socio-environmental diversity within which environmental drivers and state decentralization could significantly induce spatial variations in disease
spread and, consequently, in which countrywide parameters would not be appropriate. Moreover, at
the global scale, the COVID-19 dynamics in different countries seem highly contrasted as illustrated
by the data of Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering [25] —see
also http://covid19-forecast.biosp.org/ [26]— and could probably not be explained with a
unique time-varying contact rate parameter. Nonetheless, this model could be adapted to many
other situations at an appropriate geographical level, with a single well defined political decision
process.
Herd immunity requires that a fraction 1 − 1/R0 ≈ 70% of the population has been infected. It
is far from being reached at the country scale in France, but we observe that the fraction of immune
individuals strongly varies across the territory, with possible local immunity effects. For instance,
in the most impacted county the immunity rate is 16%, whereas it is less than 1% in less affected
counties. At a thinner grain scale, even higher rates may be observed, for instance, by April 4 the
proportion of people with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection based on antibody detection was 41%
in a high-school located in Northern France [27].
Real-time monitoring of the immunity level will be crucial to define efficient management policies, if a new outbreak occurs. We propose such a tool which is based on the modeling approach
M3 of this paper (see Immunity tab in http://covid19-forecast.biosp.org/). Remarkably,
the estimated levels of immunity are comparable to those observed in Spain by population-based
serosurveys [28], with values ranging from 0.5% to 13.0% at the beginning of May at the provincial
resolution. Such a large-scale serological testing campaign has not yet been carried out in France.
However, if such data become available in France, our predictions could be evaluated and our model
updated accordingly by including this new dataset in our estimation procedure. The mechanisticstatistical approach that we followed here can indeed be easily adapted to multiple observation
processes.
Our results indicate that —at the country scale— travel restriction alone, although they may
have a significant effect on the cumulative number of deaths and the reproduction number over a
definite period, are less efficient than social distancing and other sanitary measures. Obviously,
these results may strongly depend on the parameter values, which have been chosen here on the
basis of values estimated during the lockdown period. This is consistent with results for China [29],
where travel restrictions to and from Wuhan have been shown to have a modest effect unless paired
with other public health interventions and behavioral changes.
The model selection criteria led to a strong evidence in favor of the selection of model M3 with
non-local transmission and spatially-constant contact rate. It is much more parsimonious than
the fully heterogeneous model M2 and is therefore better suited to isolating key features of the
epidemiological dynamics [4]. Despite important restrictions on movement during the considered
period (mandatory home confinement except for essential journeys until 11 May and a 100 km
travel restriction until 2 June), the model M3 was also selected against the model M1 which does
not take into account non-local transmission. This shows that intercounty transmission is one of
these key-features that the non-local model manages to take into account.

More generally, in France just as in Italy [8], the spatial pattern of COVID-19 incidence indicates
that spatial processes play a key role. At this stage, only a few models can address this aspect.
Some have adopted a detailed spatio-temporal modeling approach and use mobility data (see [8]
for an SEIR-like model with 9 compartments). The framework we develop here, including the
non-local model and the associated estimation procedure, should be of broad interest in studying
the spatial dynamics of epidemics, due to its theoretical and numerical simplicity and its ability
to accurately track the epidemics. This approach applies when geographic distance matters, which
may not be the case at the scale of countries like the US. However, it does at more regional scales.
Furthermore, we can envision natural extensions of the approach that would take into account long
range dispersal events in the interaction term.
