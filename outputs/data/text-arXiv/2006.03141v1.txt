ABSTRACT
—

We describe in this report our studies to understand the relationship between human
mobility and the spreading of COVID-19, as an aid to manage the restart of the social and
economic activities after the lockdown and monitor the epidemics in the coming weeks
and months. We compare the evolution (from January to May 2020) of the daily mobility flows in Italy, measured by means of nation-wide mobile phone data, and the evolution of transmissibility, measured by the net reproduction number, i.e., the mean number of secondary infections generated by one primary infector in the presence of control
interventions and human behavioural adaptations. We find a striking relationship between the negative variation of mobility flows and the net reproduction number, in all
Italian regions, between March 11th and March 18th, when the country entered the lockdown. This observation allows us to quantify the time needed to “switch off” the country mobility (one week) and the time required to bring the net reproduction number below 1 (one week). A reasonably simple regression model provides evidence that the net
reproduction number is correlated with a region’s incoming, outgoing and internal mobility. We also find a strong relationship between the number of days above the epidemic threshold before the mobility flows reduce significantly as an effect of lockdowns,
and the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections per 100k inhabitants, thus indirectly showing the effectiveness of the lockdown and the other non-pharmaceutical
interventions in the containment of the contagion. Our study demonstrates the value of
“big” mobility data to the monitoring of key epidemic indicators to inform choices as the
epidemics unfolds in the coming months.

The answers to these questions are highlighted in the next sections. An interactive version of this report is available at

INTRODUCTION
—

Understanding the relationship between human mobility patterns and the
spreading of COVID-19 is crucial to the restart of social and economic activities, limited or put in “stand-by” during the national lockdown to contain the diffusion of the epidemics, and to monitor the risk of a resurgence during the current phase 2, or lockdown exit. Recent analyses document that, following the
national lockdown of March 11th, the mobility fluxes in Italy have significantly
decreased by 50% or more, everywhere in the country, as studied in our previous report [19] and [10, 21].

In this report we study the relation between human mobility and SARS-CoV-2
transmissibility before, during and after the national lockdown. We compare the
flows of people between and within Italian regions with the net reproduction
number Rt , i.e., the mean number of secondary infections generated by one primary infector in the presence of control interventions and human behavioural
adaptations. To pursue this goal, we use mobile phone data at national scale to
reconstruct the self-, in- and out-flows of Italian regions before and during the
national lockdown (initiated on March 11th, 2020), after the closure of non-essential productive and economic activities (March 23th, 2020), and after the
partial restart of economic activities and within-region movements (the “phase
2”, from May 4th, 2020).
In this report, we address the following analytical questions:

•

How does the net reproduction number vary in relation to the variation of
mobility flows?

•

What differences, if any, do we observe across the Italian regions?

•

Can we relate the delay in limiting human mobility with the rate of positive
COVID-19 cases across the population?

The answers to these questions are highlighted in the next sections.

MOBILITY DATA
—

In this report, we rely on mobile phone data, which have proven to be a useful
data source to track the time evolution of human mobility [5, 6, 11], and thus a
tool for monitoring the effectiveness of control measures such as movement
restrictions and physical distancing [1, 2, 3]. Specifically, the raw data used in
this report are the result of normal service operations performed by the mobile operator WINDTREa: CDRs (Call Detail Records) and XDRs (eXtended Detail
Records). In both cases, the fundamental geographical unit is the “phone cell”
defined as the area covered by a single antenna, i.e., the device that captures
mobile radio signals and keeps the user connected with the network. Multiple
antennas are usually mounted on the same tower, each covering a different direction. The position of the tower (expressed as latitude and longitude) and
the direction of the antenna allow inferring the extension of the corresponding
phone cell. The position of caller and callee is approximated by the corresponding antenna serving the call, whose extension is relatively small in urban contexts (in the order of 100m x 100m) and much larger in rural areas (in the order
of 1km x 1km or more).
Based on this configuration, CDRs describe the location of mobile phone users during call activities and XDRs their location during data transmission for
internet access. The information content provided by standard CDR and XDR
is the following:
Call Detail
Records (CDR)

For each phone call, a tuple <no , ni , t , As , Ae , d> is recorded, where
no and ni are pseudo-anonymous identifiers, respectively of the
“caller” and the “callee”; t is a timestamp saying when the call was
placed; As and Ae are the identifiers of the towers/antennas to which
the caller was connected at the start and end of the call; finally, d is
the call duration (e.g., in minutes).

Extended Detail
Records (XDR)

They are similar to CDRs, except that the communication is only
between the antenna and the connected mobile phone, and an
amount k of kilobytes is downloaded in the process. The format of
XDR is, therefore, a tuple <n, t, A, k>.
In both CDRs and XDRs, the identity of the users is replaced by artificial identifiers. The correspondence between such identifiers and the real identities of
the users is known only to the mobile phone operator, who might use it in case
of necessity. This pseudonymization procedure is a first important step (mentioned in Article 6 (4) and Article 25 (1) of the GDPR, the EU General Data Protection Regulation) to provide anonymity [4, 7, 8] and it will then turn into totally anonymous data for the possible treatment data use. For the analyses in this
report, we used aggregated data computed by the mobile operator covering the
period January 13th, 2020 to May 17th, 2020.

WINDTRE is one of the main mobile phone operators in Italy, covering
around 32% of the residential “human” mobile market.

Origin-Destination matrices

—

For a better matching with the available COVID-19 data (number of positive
cases and net reproduction number), we aggregated the municipality-to-municipality origin-destination matrices (ODs) into province-to-province or region-to-region ODs, in which each node represents an Italian province or region.
In particular, for each day, we compute both the out-flows, indicating the total
number of people moving from a province/region to any other province/region,
and the in-flows, indicating the total number of people moving to a province/
region from any other province/region. The trips between municipalities of the
same province/region are aggregated into a self-flow, which indicates the province/region’s internal mobility. For privacy reasons, we eliminate all out-, in- and
self-flows with values lower than 15.
As they are calculated by the operator, we store the daily municipality-to-municipality OD matrices and the daily region-to-region ones into a relational DBMS
and access them through calls to a dedicated API.
We normalize the self-, in- and out-flows by multiplying them by coefficients
provided by the mobile phone operator, which indicate an estimation of market share for every municipality. After this transformation, we have an estimation of the real size of the mobility flow between each origin and destination
municipality.
For ease of readability, Figures 1, 2 and 3 visualize the OD matrix of flows between Italian regions on February 18th (before the initiation of the national lockdown on March 9th), March 24th (during the lockdown), and May 12th (during
phase 2), respectively. We find that the OD matrix becomes significantly more
sparse during the lockdown and the phase 2, denoting a drastic reduction of the
routes between Italian regions.
Numerically, we estimate this sparsity through the network density, i.e., the proportion of the potential connections in a network that are actual connections.
We find that network density halves during the lockdown: it decreases from
d18 feb= 0.47 to d24 mar= 0.23, indicating that the lockdown erases half of the possible connections between regions compared to the previous period. Network
density remains almost unchanged between the lockdown and the phase 2
(d12 may= 0.2), presumably because movements between regions are still forbidden by law except for specific circumstances (e.g. commuting for work). These
results clearly highlight the drastic change in the structure of the human mobility network between regions in the two periods taken into consideration.
Indeed, most of the regional out-flows go towards adjacent regions. For example, before the lockdown, most of Lombardy’s out-flow is directed towards
Veneto, Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna (adjacent regions), and the rest of the
out-flows distribute more or less uniformly across all other regions, both in the
North and the South (Figure 1). In contrast, during the lockdown, the number of
these more modest out-flows decreases substantially, and most of them disappear at all (Figure 2).

Number of positive cases

The number of COVID-19 positive cases is provided by Protezione Civile, the Italian public institution in
charge of monitoring the COVID-19 emergency. They collect data from every Italian administrative region
and make them available on a public github repository [23]. For each region, we focus on the number of
new positive cases per day. Specifically, given a day g , we compute the average of values over the four
days before and the four days after g .

RELATION BETWEEN MOBILITY
FLOWS AND REPRODUCTION
NUMBER
—
Figure 4 and 5 show the evolution of the mobility self-flows (blue curves), the
net reproduction number (orange curves) and the number of positive cases
(grey curves) for the northern regions and central-southern regions, respectively. These curves reveal numerous interesting insights.

Evolution of mobility flows
All regions have a net decrease of the self-flow soon after the first national lockdown (March 11th [22]). The flows stabilized on the new, reduced volume after about one week. Subsequent restriction ordinances, such as the closing of
non-essential economic activities on March 17th [23], had a minor impact on
the reduction of self-flows. For almost all regions, we find an increase of the
self-flow since the start of phase 2 on May 4th. This behaviour is particularly
pronounced for Emilia-Romagna, Toscana, Puglia, and Lazio. Further investigation is needed to understand why these regions had such a marked increase.
Interestingly, we find a slight increase in the self-flows approaching May 4th,
the starting of “phase 2” during which a wider range of movement within regions has been allowed by the government. We interpret this result as a progressive, although slight, relaxation of compliance with the mobility limitations
imposed by the lockdown.
The case of Molise is different and particularly compelling: it is indeed the only
region for which the self-flow decreases since May 4th (Figure 5). The reason
for this decrease may be due to news media coverage about a funeral on April
30th, attended by a large number of people, which resulted in a large local outbreak. This may have induced parts of the Molise population to self-restrict
movements during the following days2.

The relationship between human mobility and viral transmissibility during the COVID-19 epidemics in Italy

Although the date when Rt =1 for the first time varies from region to region,
for all regions Rt decreases concurrently with the net decrease of self-flows
due to the beginning of the national lockdown (Figures 4 and 5)., highlighting
the importance of the government intervention. Note that Rt starts taking values lower than 1 since March 16th, when the self-flows stabilize on the new,
reduced volume. From that moment on, self-flows remain stable. Still, the Rt
continues decreasing. This may be due to other ordinances by local and national governments related to the wearing of masks and gloves in public areas, social distancing and ban on gatherings -- and possibly to other factors
to be further investigated

Evolution between January 13th and May 17th of self-flow (blue curve), net reproduction number Rt (orange curve) and moving average of the
number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections (grey curve) in the northern regions of Italy. For each day, we plot the average of the Rt values of
the three days before and after that day. The orange-shaded area indicates Rt>1. The value of the grey curve for a given day is computed as
the average of the number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections over the four days before and the four days after that day. The vertical dashed
lines indicate the beginning of the national lockdown (LD, March 9th, 2020), the closing of non-essential economic activities (CNA, March 23th,
2020) and the partial restarting of economic activities and within-region movements (“Ph 2”, May 4th, 2020). The area in white indicates the
period before mobility reduction (MR) in that region. Note that the beginning of MR does not necessarily coincide with the national lockdown
(e.g see Lombardia).

Influence of variables on disease transmissibility, measured as the net reproduction

With entropic measures we cannot control for movements within each province. If we replace mobility diversity with the in-flows, out-folws and self-flows
of each province (number of individuals registered as either changing provinces or moving within the province), we find similar statistical significance for
mobility in the previous week, confirming that outflow of people contributes to
contagion reduction, while arrival of people from outside the province or internal mobility raises it.
While a more detailed modeling of the association between contagion and mobility is certainly needed, and may lead to additional insights, these preliminary results -- together with the analysis of self-flows presented in the previous
section, provide clear evidence for a critical role of human mobility in the spatio-temporal unfolding of the epidemics.

Page 16

IMPACT OF MOBILITY REDUCTION
DELAY ON VIRUS SPREAD
—
We go one step further in our analysis of the relationships between mobility
flows and contagion by computing two quantities, for each region: 1) the delay
in mobility reduction, i.e., the number of days in which Rt> 1 before the mobility
flows of a region decrease by at least 20% w.r.t. the usual (pre-epidemics) weekly mobility, observed over January and the first two weeks of February, and 2)
the total number of reported SARS-CoV-2 infections per 100k inhabitants in
the region (as of May 15th, 2020). The date of mobility reduction below 20% for
each region is indicated as the MR black vertical line in the time series of Figures 4 and 5. Figure 7 shows a scatter plot of the two quantities for all regions,
where the size of the circle of each region is proportional to the total number of
reported infections in the observation period; the positive correlation between
the two quantities is robust (Pearson coefficient = 0.46, p < 0.05, r2 = 0.21), suggesting that larger delays could have induced heavier spreading of the virus.
This is a strong evidence that timely lockdowns are instrumental for better containment of the contagion. Two further considerations follow.

The mobility reduction in Lombardy started around 32 days after the first day in
which Rt > 1, leading to the highest number of positive cases per inhabitant in
Italy. Similarly, for other regions severely affected by the virus, such as Liguria,
Emilia-Romagna and Piedmont, the mobility reduction started around, respectively, 32 and 38 days after the first day in which Rt > 1. The central-western regions in North Italy regions lie above the dashed regression line, in the top right
part of the plot. The regions below this line, in the bottom right part of the plot,
were more effective than the regions above the line in containing the contagion,
despite the delay in lockdown of 30 days or more, such as Veneto, Lazio, and
Tuscany. This fact may be explained by several factors, including the effectiveness of the epidemic surveillance, the intensity of the testing and tracing strategy adopted, the capacity of outbreak containment, and also the absolute number of cases when Rt jumps above 1.
On the other hand, for southern regions the mobility reduction started with
around 10 days of delay (Molise, Basilicata) or around 20 days (Campania,
Puglia, Sicily, Calabria), which presumably was effective in containing the
spread of the virus: all southern regions (with the only exception of Molise) are
below the regression line in the bottom left part of the plot (low number of infections per 100K inhabitants). Central-southern regions are the ones who benefited the most from the lockdown, presumably because it started more timely.
This brings further evidence of the effectiveness of the lockdown.

FIGURE 7
DELAY IN MOBILITY REDUCTION vs TOTAL NUMBER OF CASES PER 100K INHABITANTS
In the scatter plot, the horizontal axis has the number of days between the first time Rt > 1and the beginning of the national lockdown. The vertical axis has the cumulative incidence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infections per 100k inhabitants (as of May 15th, 2020). The size of the circles is proportional to the total
number of positive cases in the period (Pearson coefficient= 0.46, p<0.05, R2 = 0.21).

CONCLUSIONS
—
Our combined analysis of mobility and epidemics highlighted a striking relation between the negative variation of movement fluxes and the negative
variation of the net reproduction number, in all Italian regions, in the time interval of approximately one week, from March 9th till March 16th, during the transition between the two mobility modalities. During this week, the two curves
gracefully overlap; at the end of this week, the country has reached a new “stable” mobility regime, approximately at 40% of the pre-lockdown level. The two
curves exhibit the same pattern everywhere, both at regional and provincial level, with minimal temporal lags. We call this phenomenon, represented schematically in Figure 8, the “epi-mob” pattern. Mobility, the blue curve, is a “switch”
between two very different levels, before and during the lockdown, with an exponential fall from the first to the second; the epidemics is a peaked distribution
with an exponential growth and fall, overlapping with the “switch” during the fall.

The presumable effectiveness of the lockdown for the containment of the epidemics is further substantiated by the pattern in Figure 7, relating the timeliness of lockdown in every region with the total number of infected individuals
per 100K inhabitants. We can also quantify the time needed to “switch off” the
country mobility (approx. 1 week to reach the new lower regime) and the time
needed to bring the net reproduction number below 1 (again, approx. 1 week).
Notice that Rt continues to slowly decrease during lockdown, and also that at
the beginning of phase 2 (lockdown exit), when mobility begins to rise again, Rt
does not jump into a new uncontrolled growth, at least until May 17th, the last
day of observation in this report. This is probably due to the non-pharmaceutical interventions in place, including the increased compliance of people to use
personal protective equipment and respect social distancing (compared to the
pre-lockdown phase). Another factor limiting the increase of Rt in the Phase
2 could also be related to an increased ability to trace, test and isolate infected individuals. We have also shown that a simple regression model provides
reasonable estimates of the Rt in a given region (or province) as a function of
the in- and out-flows. Clearly, the accuracy of the estimation is influenced by
the changes in containment interventions and in citizens’ behaviour towards
prevention measures. Consequently, learning a regression model for Rt during
pre-lockdown and early lockdown and applying the model for predicting the Rt
during phase 2 would probably lead to overestimating it; however, such worstcase scenario might be useful for comparison with the actual Rt measured, as
a mean to evaluate the effectiveness of the containment policy in act and citizens’ social behavior. An interesting point that calls for further study is how to
continuously learn an estimation model for the Rt , whose accuracy is continuously monitored, to the purpose of nowcasting the Rt , shortening as much as
possible the lag of time to wait until the Rt becomes known.

As a conclusion, we believe that this study demonstrated the value of “big” mobility data, a detailed proxy of human behavior available every day in real time,
to the purpose of refining our understanding of the dynamics of the epidemics,
reasoning on the effectiveness of policy choices for non-pharmaceutical interventions and on citizens’ compliance to social distancing measures, and help
monitoring key epidemic indicators to inform choices as the epidemics unfolds
in the coming months.

the average of the number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections over the four days before and the four days after that day. The vertical dashed
lines indicate the beginning of the national lockdown (LD, March 9th, 2020), the closing of non-essential economic activities (CNA, March 23th,
2020) and the partial restarting of economic activities and within-region movements (“Ph 2”, May 4th, 2020). The area in white indicates the
period before mobility reduction (MR) in that region. Note that the beginning of MR does not necessarily coincide with the national lockdown
(e.g. see Lombardia).

FIGURE 10: IN-FLOWS VS NET REPRODUCTION NUMBER IN CENTRAL-SOUTHERN REGIONS
Evolution between January 13th and May 17th of in-flows (blue curve), net reproduction numbers (orange curve) and moving average of the
number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections (grey curve) in the central-southern regions of Italy. For each day, we plot the average of the Rt
values of the three days before and after that day. The orange-shaded area indicates Rt>1. The value of the grey curve for a given day is computed as the average of the number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections over the four days before and the four days after that day. The vertical dashed lines indicate the beginning of the national lockdown (LD, March 9th, 2020), the closing of non-essential economic activities (CNA,
March 23th, 2020) and the partial restarting of economic activities and within-region movements (“Ph 2”, May 4th, 2020). The area in white indicates the period before mobility reduction (MR) in that region. Note that the beginning of MR does not necessarily coincide with the national lockdown.
