Every unique crisis, a new and novel risk factor, leads to a rapid, synchronous and panic sell-oﬀ
by the investors that lead to a massive stock market crash, termed as mainshock, which usually
continues for more than one day. Though most of the stocks start recovering from the crash within
a short period, the eﬀect of the crash remains throughout the recovery phase. During the recovery,
as the market remains in stress, any small perturbation leads to a relatively smaller aftershock,
which may also occur for a few days. Statistical analysis of the mainshock and the aftershocks for
the crash of 1987, the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic shows that they follow
the Gutenberg-Richter (G-R) power law. The duration of the inﬂuence of the mainshock, within
which aftershocks are considered, has been calculated using structural break analysis. The analysis
shows that high magnitude aftershocks comparable to the mainshock are rare but low magnitude
aftershocks can be seen frequently till the full recovery of the market. It is also consistent with
the psychology of the investors that when the unique crisis becomes known, the market does not
react too irrationally as it did initially, and hence subsequent crashes becomes relatively smaller.
The results indicate that there is a possibility of occurrence of future low magnitude aftershocks
due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis may help investors make rational investment
decisions during the stressed period after a major market crash.

INTRODUCTION

Complex dynamical systems, such as stock market,
earth crust, climate, ocean show extreme events in the
form of price crash, earthquake, storm and tsunami under certain crisis [1–9]. Some of these extreme events
which can be termed as the main-shock, leads to a series
of smaller aftershocks [1, 9–11]. The dynamics of such
systems can be characterized statistically by power-law
distributions [11–16]. In the stock market, an extreme
event occurs in the form of a major crash due to the
emergence of every new and novel risk factor, for which
investors are not prepared [17, 18]. The new unique risk
leads to a wide fluctuation in price and volume because
of the investors’ irrational behavior in the volatile stock
markets, and causes a massive crash [18–22].
Crashes in stock market occurs mainly due to instability formed due to herding behavior [23, 24], speculation, overvaluation like in the 1929 crash [25], 1987
crash [26–28] and the financial crisis of 2008 [29]. The
other reason for the stock market crash is due to the
emergence of novel risk factor like the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 [18–21]. The events like financial crisis
and pandemic have had devastating effects in all sectors
of the economy that lasted for several months to years,
and the stock market remains in stress till the economy
or the market fully recovered [18, 30, 31]. During the
stressed period after the major crash, many aftershocks of
comparatively smaller magnitudes occur due to investors’
cautious approach in the investment [11, 15, 16, 32, 33].

The analysis methods that are applied to study the
geophysical phenomena have also been applied to understand the statistical properties of the price crashes and
subsequent aftershocks due to a crisis in the stock market [11, 15, 16]. The Gutenberg-Richter (G-R) power
law and Omori law are frequently used to explain the
statistical properties of the mainshock and subsequent
aftershocks [11, 15, 16, 34]. In these studies, the mainshock and aftershocks were identified for one-day data
with the one-minute absolute log return [34], and 60,
100 and 240 days data with the one-day absolute log
return [11, 15, 16, 35]. However, these analyses have the
following limitations.
1. As the market crash can continue for more than a
day [8, 9, 30], the mainshock and aftershock can
not be limited to a single day or minute return.
2. After the implementation of the circuit breakers in
the market, it takes more than a day to complete
an intense crash. Hence, taking one day fall as a
mainshock or aftershock may be erroneous.
3. When one-day absolute log return is considered,
both the crashes and recoveries act as a crash.
4. The duration of the aftershocks sequence has been
taken arbitrarily though the effect of major crash
may stay for a longer/shorter period on the market
and economy. Hence, identifying the proper data
length is also very essential to analyze the statistics
of mainshock and its aftershocks.
This paper aims to study the statistical properties of
main and secondary crashes due to a crisis, overcoming

2
the above limitations. We have estimated the mainshock
and aftershocks as the cumulative consecutive fall of a
stock price. If the secondary crashes are above 7.0% of
the main crash, they are considered as an aftershock.
Further, the structural break analysis method [36, 37] is
applied to estimate the duration of influence of the mainshock to identify the number of aftershocks. We obtained
that the aftershocks sequence follows the G-R power law.
We also intend to extract some new information about
the possible occurrence of aftershocks during the latest
stock market crash in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The paper is organised as follows: Sec. II discusses
about the methods used for the analysis. Sec. III provides
the data description. Sec. IV discusses about the results
obtained from the analysis. Finally, Sec. V includes the
summary of the paper and our concluding remarks.

METHODOLOGY

Gutenberg-Richter power law

The Gutenberg-Richter (G-R) power law is one of the
important empirical law that is applied to study the statistical properties of an earthquake in geophysics [38, 39].
It shows the relationship between the number of earthquakes (aftershocks) to the magnitude of each earthquakes. It states that the cumulative number of earthquakes (N ) with magnitude M larger than or equal to
M is proportional to M and is given by
log10 N (M ) = α − βM

(1)

Where α and β are two positive constants. The slope
β shows the relationship between the convergence process after a shock to its magnitude. Eqn. 1 states that
the larger the magnitude, the fewer the remaining aftershocks. Hence, the larger the magnitude of the aftershock, the shorter will be the length of the aftershocks
sequence. The large absolute value of β indicates the
occurrence of more aftershocks with low magnitude and
the smaller absolute β value indicates fewer aftershocks
with high magnitude. The constant parameter α represents the number of remaining aftershocks, which does
not depend on the magnitude of the aftershocks [11, 16].

below [36, 37]. Let us consider the following structural
change model with m break points
′

′

yt = xt ζ + zt δj + ut ,

t = Tj−1 + 1, ....., Tj

(2)

where, j = 1, ..., m. xt (p × 1) and zt (q × 1) are vectors of covariates and ut is the disturbance at time t.
The break dates (T1 , ..., Tm ) are explicitly treated as unknown. The purpose is to estimate the unknown regression coefficients ζ, δj and the break dates. For each mpartition (T1 , ..., Tm ), denoted by Tj , the associate least
square estimates of ζ, δj are obtained by minimizing the
following objective function
m+1
X

Ti
X

′

′

(yt − xt ζ − zt δi )2

(3)

i=1 t=Ti−1 +1

Let ζ̂(Tj ) and δ̂(Tj ) denote the resulting estimates that
minimize the objective function. The sum of squared
residual, SSRT (T1 , ...., Tm ) is obtained by substituting
ζ̂(Tj ) and δ̂(Tj ) in the above objective function. The
resulting estimated break dates T1 , ...., Tm are obtained
as
{(Tˆ1 ), ..., (Tˆm )} = arg min SSRT {T1 , ...., Tm }
T1 ,...Tm

(4)

where the minimization is done over all partitions
(T1 , ..., Tm ). The break date estimators are global minimizer of the objective function. Let v(i, j) be the recursive residual at time j obtained using a sample that
starts at date i. SSR(i, j) is the sum of squared residual obtained by applying least-squares to a segment that
starts at date i and ends at date j with SSR(i, j) =
SSR(i, j − 1) + v(i, j)2 . In order to evaluate the global
optimal partition, a dynamical programming approach is
applied on the sums of squared residual of all the relevant combination of (i, j) segments. Finally, m break
points have been obtained from the global optimal partition function SSR(Tm,K ) by using first K observation
as given in the following recursive equation.
SSR(Tm,K ) =

min

{SSR(Tm−1,j )+SSR(j+1, K)}

mh≤K≤K−h

(5)
In our regression procedure, we have taken upto 3-break
points or four segments and zt = {1} as a constant regressor.

Structural Break Technique
III.

The structural break analysis method developed by Bai
and Perron (1998, 2003) [36, 37] is applied to capture the
structural changes in a time series data. As the structural
breaks emerge because of a sudden change in a time series due to a crisis, it helps us to identify the duration
of the influence of a crisis [36, 37, 40, 41]. A detailed
discussion on the calculation of structural breaks is given

DATA ANALYSED

The proposed methodologies have been applied to
identify the statistics of the stock price crashes on the
time series of the daily closing price of indices and companies. The stock data were taken from Yahoo Finance [42].
We have analyzed three mainshocks: the 1987 crash, the
financial crisis of 2008, ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and

their subsequent aftershocks. In the 1987 crash case, we
have taken DJIA index data as daily closing prices of
other companies were unavailable.
Fourteen dominant world stock indices have been
taken, and they are Nasdaq (USA), DJIA (USA), HSI
(Hongkong), BEL20 (Belgium), IBOVESPA (Brazil),
BSE SENSEX (India), DAX (Germany), IBEX35
(Spain), IPC (Mexico), Nifty50 (India), NIKKEI225
(Japan), S&P500 (USA), SSE (China), CAC40 (France).
Further, we have also taken thirty-one listed companies
under these indices.

subsequent aftershocks of 1987 crash, the financial crisis
of 2008 and COVID-19 pandemic using our proposed definition of market crashes. We have calculated the influence time length of these crashes using 3-points structural
break analysis. All the stocks mentioned in Sec. III have

FIG. 3. Solid line represents the daily closing price of S&P500
index from 2006 to December 2012. The dotted lines represent
the quarterly GDP growth rate of USA from 2006 to 2012.
The vertical lines represents the structural break points.

We first investigate the DJIA index from 1987 to 1990
during and after the Black Monday crash occurred at
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) that was considered
one of the worst crashes in the history of the NYSE.
We found that the crash continued for eleven consecutive
days. Fig. 1 represents the daily closing price of DJIA
index during that period. In order to identify the number
of aftershocks due to the mainshock of the 1987 crash,
the duration of the influence of it is identified using the
structural break analysis as given in Subsec. II B. The
closest breakpoints is shown by the vertical dotted lines
in Fig. 1. The first vertical dotted line represents the
starting point of the mainshock, and the second dotted
line represents the end of the effect of the mainshock.
Hence, the time of influence of the 1987 crash is from the
time of the mian crash till the end of 1989. The identified

Fig. 2 shows the cumulative number (N ) of aftershocks
of magnitude (M ) larger than or equal to 7% of the mainshock. We performed a fit with the functional form of
Eq 1. Fig. 2 shows the typical plot of M versus log(N )
that describes the empirical data well for the study period, i.e., the 1987 crash and its aftershocks follow the
G-R power law. The straight line represents the best
fit, and we obtained the value of α and β mentioned in
Eqn. 1 are 1.6 and 25.0, respectively. The figure clearly
shows that the aftershocks with high magnitude are significantly less and aftershocks with low magnitude occur
more frequently after the mainshock. We have also obtained similar paradigmatic behavior of the leading stock
price indices and companies due to the financial crisis of
2008 and COVID-19 pandemic, 2020, and the detailed
analyses are given below.

and β is calculated for all the 45 stocks which is shown
in Table I. From the figure it is clear that aftershocks
sequence of S&P 500 and Amazon Inc. follow the G-R
power law during the financial crisis of 2008. Similar results have been found for the rest of the 43 companies
for financial crisis of 2008. Detailed analysis of all the
indices and companies are given in Table I.

In Fig. 3 the solid line and dashed line represent the
daily closing price of S&P 500 index from 2006 to 2012
and the quarterly GDP growth rate of USA from 2006 to
2012, respectively. The vertical solid line are the structural breaks obtained for the financial crisis of 2008. The
financial crisis of 2008 can been clearly captured from
these solid vertical line. The closest breakpoints of the
mainshock and recovery are mid of 2008 and end of 2011
respectively. Hence, we have taken the data from the
time of mainshock till the end of 2011 to analyze the
influence of the mainshock. Similar analysis has been
carried out for the rest of the 44 companies and indices.
Detailed analysis of all the indices and companies are
given in Table I.

FIG. 4. (a) and (b) represent the plot between cumulative
number of events (N) and the corresponding magnitude (M)
of S&P500 index and Amazon Inc., respectively during the
2008 ﬁnancial crisis.

Fig. 4 (a) and Fig. 4 (b) show the typical plot of M
versus log(N ) of S&P 500 index and Amazon Inc., respectively during the 2008 financial crisis. The points show
the aftershocks with its magnitude and the straight line
represents the best fit of the aftershocks sequence. We
clearly see that the number of aftershocks with high magnitude is very low, and the number of aftershocks with
low magnitude is very high that is observed from the cluster of points formed around low magnitude region. This
shows that the aftershocks with high magnitude are rare
and aftershocks with low magnitude occurs frequently
until the market fully recovers from the shock. We obtained the value of α and β of Eqn.1 during the financial
crisis for S&P 500 are 1.7 and 13.0 and for Amazon Inc.
are 1.9 and 15.0 respectively. The absolute value of β in
Fig. 4 (a) is less than Fig. 4 (b) that indicates the later
has more aftershocks than the former. The values of α

Fig. 5 (a) and Fig. 5 (b) shows the plot of M versus
log(N ) of S&P 500 index and Amazon Inc., respectively
during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The best fit
straight line of aftershocks gives us the value of α and β
for S&P 500 are 1.3 and 15.0 and for Amazon Inc. are
1.5 and 21.0 respectively. It is observed that the absolute
value of β in Fig. 5 (a) is less than Fig. 5 (b). This
implies that the Amazon Inc. has more aftershocks than
the S&P 500. It is also clear from Fig. 5(a) and (b) that
the aftershocks sequence of S&P 500 and Amazon Inc.
follow the G-R power law during this ongoing pandemic.
We have carried the analysis for all the 45 companies and
indices and we found that these indices and companies
follow the G-R power law. Detailed analysis of all the
indices and companies are given in Table I.
It is interesting to note that for COVID-19 pandemic,
there is no cluster of points in the low magnitude region as observed in the Fig. 4 (a) and (b), and a gap
between the highest magnitude aftershock and its next
aftershock is observed in Fig. 5 (a). These observations
give us a strong indication that more aftershocks with
low magnitude can be anticipated in the near future due
to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The gap seen in
high magnitude region of Fig. 5 (a) shows the possibility

during the ﬁnancial Crisis of 2008. The data has been taken
from 2007 to 2012.

The temporal variance of the aftershocks sequence is
presented in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 of S&P 500 during the
financial crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. They show that the number of aftershocks per
unit time does not decay with time. Sometimes the number of aftershocks per unit time increases and hence does
not follow the Omori law. This finding is in contradiction

to the previous studies [11, 15, 34]. Our finding is consistent with the statistics of the mainshock and aftershocks
in stock price as explained below.
After a major crash, the market recovers for a certain
period, but due to some negative perturbation, stressed
condition of economy and fear of investors lead to smaller
crashes. During the stressed period of the market recovery, it is observed that the number of aftershocks per unit

time increases significantly at the later period of market
recovery. Hence, it is unlikely to follow Omori law during the market recovery after a major crash. The studies
showed in Ref. [11, 15, 34] on the decay of aftershocks
with time that holds Omori law may be incomplete due
to the erroneous definition of the mainshock, aftershocks
and duration of influence that is discussed in Sec.I.
V.

CONCLUSION

This paper analyzes the statistical nature of the aftershocks sequence after major stock market crashes for
the 1987 crash, the financial crisis of 2008 and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis is carried out for
45 stocks and indices, considering that the mainshock or
aftershock is a cumulative consecutive fall of the stock
price. The duration of influence of the mainshock is
obtained by the 3-point structural break method. The
mainshock and aftershocks follow the Gutenberg-Richter
power law. We found that in 1987 crash and 2008 financial crisis there is a dense cluster of aftershocks in the
low magnitude region. This indicates that aftershocks of

low magnitude occurs more frequently rather than high
magnitude aftershocks.
The analysis shows that in the ongoing COVID-19
event, the number of aftershocks in the low-magnitude
region is less, and there is a gap in the high-magnitude
region. These results indicate that few more aftershocks
with smaller amplitudes may be anticipated in the near
future during this ongoing pandemic till the pandemic
is completely eliminated. However, the probability of
an aftershock with a large magnitude during the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic is very less as it is no longer a novel
risk to the market. Further, the analysis shows that the
number of aftershocks does not necessarily decay with
time, and does not obey Omori’s power law. The analysis may help investors make rational investment decisions
during the stressed period after a major market crash.
