Abstract
Recently in various theoretical works, a path-breaking progress has been made to recover
the well known Page Curve of an evaporating black hole with the help of Quantum Extremal
Surfaces (QES) aka Islands, which was mainly proposed to solve the long-standing black
hole information loss problem related to the unitarity issue. Motivated by this outstanding
concept, in this work, we study the crucial role of Quantum Extremal Islands to reproduce
the Page Curve in the presence of negative (AdS) and positive (dS) Cosmological Constant with radiation in the background of Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW)
space-time with the help of squeezed quantum state originated cosmological complexity.
Without using any explicit details of the gravitational theoretical model, we establish a
closed connecting relationship among cosmological complexity, a measure of quantum chaos
i.e., Out-of-Time Ordered Correlators (OTOC) and quantum corrected entanglement entropy of evaporating black hole in the presence of Cosmological Islands. This alternative
effective treatment finally helps us to reproduce to the most desired Page Curve in Island inspired Cosmology to preserve the black hole information loss issue. On top of this,
the present treatment helps us to interpret the explicit role of quantum chaos inside the
evaporating black holes in the presence of Cosmological Islands.

Prologue

In recent times, various outstanding concepts of quantum information theory has been
extensively used to decode the enormous number of hidden secrets of a quantum theory
of gravity. Among all of these well known successful tools and techniques in this paper,
we particularly concentrate on the underlying physics of circuit complexity [1], the notion
of which was introduced for the first time by Professor Leonard Susskind to understand
the mysteries of quantum aspects black holes physics, is one such computational technique
which recently has been an important and very successful probe in diagnosing certain
interesting features underlying the system. Before going into the details of the subject
material of this paper, let us familiarize the readers with the bigger picture to develop the
strong background motivation of this paper.
The quantum extremal surface aka Island programme has been a very successful theoretical concept in reproducing the Page Curve for an evaporating black hole [2] from semiclassical considerations, which has been recently studied in various remarkable works [3–6].
This program came into the picture to propose a possible solution to the long-standing
famous Hawking Information Loss paradox [7–9] related to the preserving unitarity in
evaporating black holes. A systematic description of the von-Neumann entanglement entropy or better known in the literature as the fine-grained entropy, which can be applied
to both in the black hole and Hawking radiation, was missing, which can able to solve
this long-standing paradox in theoretical physics. Hence, the proper understanding and
generating of the Page Curve remained incomplete and led to many contradicting views. It
was found that the consistent way of computing the entropy involved an area of a surface
which is not the horizon. It is the surface that extremizes the generalised entropy, and
hence the name arises Quantum Extremal Surface (QES) in the associated literature. In
refs. [3–5], the authors explicitly showed that using QES, one can systematically start
from a pure quantum state black hole, and during the entire process of evaporation, a
consistent definition of the fine-grained entropy can be given. The curve displayed by this
fine-grained entropy shows that the expected Page curve is devoid of any contradictions.
Hence it was found that the fine-grained entropy computed including QES gave a new way
to compute the entropy of Hawking radiation and the final result was consistent with the
unitary evolution as expected from quantum mechanics. It was found that in order to
successfully describe the process, a bulk region was needed to be added in the QES after
the Page transition time, which aids in reproducing the Page curve. These bulk regions
are known as Islands, which serves the purpose.
The first version of the fine-grained entropy given by Ryu-Takyanagi [10] introduced
to calculate holographic entanglement in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time has been subsequently modified and generalised by a number of authors [11–15] in due course. The present

2

applicability of the formula is much more general and is applicable to any quantum system
coupled to gravity. However, the computation of this fine-grained entanglement entropy
is not always very trivial. Addressing this difficulty and taking the motivation from the
Leonard Susskind’s path-breaking idea [16], where the author explicitly showed that the
rate of change of complexity [17–19] is equal to the product of entropy and the equilibrium
saturation temperature, which is simply given by [16] ¶ :
Complexity rate as fine grained entropy :

dC
= ST
dt

,

(1.3)

using this outstanding connecting relationship, one can expect to find various underlying
unexplored features of entanglement entropy by studying complexity without going into the
technical details of computing the fine grained entanglement entropy from a given gravitational theoretical paradigm. In this paper, we have explicitly shown that the cosmological
circuit complexity intimately related with the notion of Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlation
(OTOC) functions [20–22] which is generally used as a probe of quantum chaos [23]. Now
using the above-mentioned expression for the rate of complexity, we have further established a very useful relationship between the fine-grained entanglement entropy and the
quantum chaos for an evaporating black hole in Cosmological Islands. This helps us not
only revive the well-known Page Curve but also makes an underlying unusual connection
between the fine-grained entropy and the measure of quantum mechanical chaos, through
OTOC, which is described by the following Universal Bound which we will explicitly derive
¶

Within the framework of Island FLRW Cosmology this relationship can be represented by the following
simplified expression:
Complexity rate for Cosmological Islands :

dC

ST
da
H(τ )

,

(1.1)

where the conformal time dependent Hubble parameter is defined by the following expression:
H(τ ) =

1 da(τ )
.
a(τ ) dτ

(1.2)

We will provide the detailed derivation of this expression in the later of this paper as we proceed on the
technical developments on the subject material of the paper. For the solution of the Friedmann equations
in terms of the scale factor in the framework of Cosmological FLRW Islands, we consider two specific types
of physically important solutions, in AdS and dS background in the presence of radiation, respectively
in the latter half of the paper. We found that the AdS-radiation solution can able to reproduce the
Page Curve in Cosmological Island prescription. On the other hand, dS-radiation can’t be able to do so.
But both the solutions are consistent with Quantum Chaos and Complexity descriptions in the present
framework.

where the equality holds for the maximal chaos inside the Island-inspired bulk region of
an evaporating black hole in the FLRW cosmological background. Here the quantity, c̄ ∼
N −1/2 , where N represents the number of degrees of freedom. Additionally, it is important
to note that, the Quantum Lyapunov Exponent, to describe the quantum description of
the chaotic phenomena has to satisfy the following constraint, which is commonly cited as
the Maldacena Shenker Stanford (MSS) bound in the associated literature, as given by [] ‖ :

Here β represents the inverse equilibrium temperature of the chaotic system during saturation of the OTOC at a large evolutionary scale. The equality symbol in the MSS bound
signifies the maximal saturation of quantum chaos. In this connection, here, it is important
to note that recently in ref. [24], Tom Hartman and co-authors investigated the Cosmological Islands and the conditions for them to appear in gravitational curved space-time
without singularities. They showed that islands appear in the four-dimensional FLRW
cosmology with radiation and negative cosmological constant(cc), and in the positive cosmological constant case, islands are absent in the bulk region. We take a leaf from this
paper, and using the above relation between complexity and entropy as our basic guiding
principle, we reinvestigate these two particularly well-known cases from the perspective of
quantum chaos using the notion of circuit complexity. In this paper, we indeed show that
the complexity for four-dimensional FLRW with radiation and negative CC for AdS case
exhibit Page curve behaviour which is absent for the positive CC dS case.

In the context of FLRW cosmology by utilizing the fact that, the Quantum Lyapunov Exponent can
be computed from the scale factor dependence of the Cosmological Complexity i.e.

one can give a Cosmological extended version of the MSS bound, which is given by:

The organization of the paper is as follows:
• In Sec. 2, we provide a brief review of the long-standing Black hole information loss
problem and various proposals given till date to solve it, focussing mainly on the
Island proposal as our prime motivation is to study the cosmological extension of
this path-breaking concept.
• In Sec. 3, we introduce the concept of circuit complexity to the readers to motivate
them about the role of this computational tool in probing various unexplored theoretical framework related to quantum chaos and information theory related issues.
• We then provide the useful cosmological FLRW models with radiation and AdS and
dS space-time that we have considered in this paper for the purpose of studying chaos
and complexity in Sec. 4 of this paper.
• Following that in Sec. 5, we provide the analytical expressions of circuit complexity
calculated from two different cost functionals commonly used from the perspective
of cosmological perturbation theory written in the language of squeezed quantum
states.
• In Sec. 6, we establish a closed connecting relation between fine-grained entanglement entropy, OTOC, and circuit complexity, which serves our whole purpose of
reproducing the Page Curve by calculating circuit complexity rather than explicitly
computing the explicit expression for the fine-grained entanglement entropy from
a given gravitational theoretical paradigm in 3 + 1 space-time dimensions in the
background of Island-inspired FLRW cosmological background.
• Sec. 7 contains our numerical calculation of the cosmological version of the circuit
complexity and estimation of various quantities like the measure of quantum chaos,
i.e., quantum Lyapunov exponent and the associated equilibrium saturation temperature at the later scale of evolution, which helps us to further comment on the chaotic
features of the cosmological FLRW models with radiation and AdS and dS spacetime which we have considered for generating the Page Curve from the Cosmological
Island proposal.
• Finally, in Sec. 8, we conclude with our all findings in this paper with some interesting
future prospects of the present work.

A brief review on Islands Paradigm

Black holes are thought to hold the key for quantum aspects of the gravitational
paradigm, and it has kept everyone puzzled ever since it’s appearance in Einstein’s theory
of General Relativity. One of the biggest conundrums in quantum mechanics of black hole
physics, for half a century or so, has been the problem of unitarity or, in other words,
Black Hole Information loss problem. Over the years, many proposals have been suggested
to solve this problem. Two notable proposals that exist in the literature for the long time
are appended below:
1. Fuzzball paradigm:
The micro-states of a quantum black hole are considered to be ‘fuzzballs’ with no
horizon at all [25–32]. Like a normal warm body, these special type of black hole
microstates also radiate from their surface. This resolves the long-standing information loss paradox or the unitary issue of the quantum black holes. So, within the
framework of the fuzzball paradigm the well-known black hole information paradox
is resolved because, in this physical concept, the basic notion of the black hole is
replaced by an object with no horizon.
2. Firewall paradigm:
To solve the black hole information loss paradox, firewall paradigm has been introduced by Ahmed Almheiri, Donald Marolf, Joseph Polchinski, and James Sully
[33, 34]. Later, Suvrat Raju and Kyriakos Papadodimas did remarkable work to
strengthen more the physical background of the firewall paradigm. It was claimed
that if the traditional black hole is replaced with something that has a surface just
after the horizon, then an infalling object will get burnt by this surface. If such a
burning indeed happens, then one can say that the infalling object has encountered
a ‘firewall’.

2.1

Pedagogical details

Then in 2019, a miracle happened in this area to find the more appropriate solution of
the black hole information loss problem. A very young theoretical physicist, Geoffery Pennington, along with Douglas Stanford, Ahmed Almheiri, Juan Martin Maldacena, Tomas
Hartman, and many renowned physicists came up with the path-breaking remarkable physical concept of tackling this problem by introducing Islands [3–5, 37–43], which is a special
type of Quantum Extremal Surface (QES) appearing inside the bulk region and obviously
the horizon of an evaporating black hole. They proposed that the contribution to black
hole entropy not only came from the inside the horizon (bulk) region but also from the

7

evaporating black hole as a function of physical evolutionary time scale. This schematic
diagram was taken from [35].
outside horizon region of the evaporating black hole. Taking into consideration the contribution of the outside region, aka Islands, the generalized quantum entangled fine-grained
entropy of the black hole, the unitarity issue can be solved perfectly, and consequently, the
black hole information loss paradox can also be resolved with this outstanding proposal.
It is important to mention here that, without the inclusion of the Island in the bulk
region of the evaporating black hole, the associated entropy of the Hawking radiation
increases monotonically with respect to the evolutionary time scale. On the other hand,
quantum mechanics demands that the final state of a black hole should be a pure state,
and the entanglement entropy should go to zero after a long time. The Island proposal
provides a quantum correction in the result for the Bekenstein Hawking entropy, which
is explicitly used to quantify the fine-grained entanglement entropy for an evaporating
black hole. By considering the existence of the Island region inside the event horizon of
an evaporating black hole, it has been shown that after the Page time, the fine grained
Island corrected entropy starts to decrease to reach zero after a long time, which means

outgoing radiation of the evaporating black hole as a function of physical evolutionary
time scale. This schematic diagram was taken from [36]
there is no entanglement at the very late time scale. Hence, the fundamental notion of

9

unitarity of the black hole information is restored, as can be seen in figure 2.1. Here we
can see that the black curve is obtained from Hawking’s original computation for the
evaporating black holes, which can’t be able to restore the unitary issue related to the
long-standing information loss problem. In this case, it was found that at the very late
time scale, the associated entropy of the evaporating black hole saturates to a constant
value with respect to the evolutionary time scale. Here it satisfies half of the requirement
in the present context in the early time scale, but in the late time scale, computation
goes against the restoration of the unitarity of the black hole information. On the other
hand, the thermodynamic entropy computed from the quantum entanglement prescription
is consistent with the green curve. This shows that at the early time scale, it is not
consistent with Hawking’s original computation, but at the late time scale, it follows the
requirement to preserve the above mentioned unitary issue. In this case, as well the general
requirement is satisfied partially at the late time scale. The inclusion of a very special
Quantum Extremal Surface (QES) actually serves both the purpose by introducing fine
graining in the entropy of the black hole, the necessary requirements needed at the early
and the late time scale. This is represented by the red curve, which in this literature is
commonly known as the Page curve. This actually preserves the unitarity and solves the
long-standing black hole information loss paradox in the present context.
One can divide the whole story of getting the Page curve in the presence of QES Island into the following six regions, which we have explained in detail to understand the
underlying physics of resolving the long-standing black hole information loss paradox:
1. Region 1:
In this region, an evaporating black hole radiate by forming entangled particle pairs.
One of the pairs goes actually inside the event horizon of the black hole. The other
particle goes outside the horizon. Most importantly, in this region, the entanglement
entropy of the evaporating black hole grows with the background evolutionary time
scale.
2. Region 2:
In this region, the associated entangled entropy of the evaporating black hole grows
more with the background evolutionary time scale compared to the previous region.
This happened due to the fact that the number of entangled particle pairs of the evaporating black hole grows with respect to the time scale, which finally gives rise to the
increment in the entanglement between these pairs, and the associated entanglement
entropy linearly grows with the evolutionary time scale.
3. Region 3:
In this region, a very special Quantum Extremal Surface (QES), the notion of the

Island prescription is included inside the bulk, most importantly inside the event
horizon of the evaporating black hole. Initially, for a certain time span, the entanglement entropy of the particle pairs grows linearly with the evolutionary time
scale. Then at a particular time scale, which we identified as the Page time scale,
a very interesting fact happens. Instead of linear incremental growth in the entropy
function with respect to the evolutionary time scale, which is the usual expected
known fact from Hawking’s original good old computation, at this mentioned time
scale, a transition happened. Usually, this is identified to be the Hawking-Page phase
transition for which a sudden change in the temporal dependence behaviour of the
entanglement entropy function happens, and finally, give rise to a phase transition
from the well-known Hawking phase to the Page phase.
4. Region 4:
In this region, the inclusion of the Island in this computation makes this transition possible smoothly for which in the new phase, which we have identified to be
the Page phase, the entropy function started linearly fall respect to the time scale

just after the Page time scale. The main reason for this sudden change in the behaviour of the entropy function is due to losing the effect of quantum entanglement
of the pair of particle pairs. Due to such a losing effect, the non entangled part of
the radiation of the evaporating black hole come outside the event horizon.
5. Region 5:
In this region, the previously participated particles are not treated as part of the
inside bulk region of the evaporating black hole. As a consequence, the associated
fine-grained entropy is not treated as the previously mentioned entanglement entropy
of the evaporating black hole, which has the property that it linearly grows with the
underlying evolutionary time scale. Here, the entropy function decreases more compared to the previous region with respect to the evolutionary time scale of the black
hole.
6. Region 6:
Finally, in this region, the associate entropy function drops to zero in the time scale.
This is because of the fact that all the information in the form of radiation comes

out from the black hole, and truly speaking, there is no such black hole that exists
in this region as it completely evaporates. Also, the entropy is not representative
of the quantum entanglement phenomena at all in this region as there is no such
entanglement exist at the end.
In the above-mentioned representative regions, we have divided the whole Page curve
story into the six consecutive regions, though the boundary that we have drawn to differentiate between the different regions just from the basic intuition. The phase boundary
in a technical sense exist only at the boundary between the Region 3 and Region 4,
which is this description is identified to be the Hawking-Page phase transition, which is
appearing at the transition time scale, known as Page time. For further technical details
on the Island, we suggest the readers look into the following discussions.

Technical details

Island formula generalizes the well known Ryu-Takayanagi formula used to quantify the
holographic entanglement entropy [10–15, 44–46]. Let us consider, R be a non-gravitational

system which is entangled with a gravitational system. Then von Neuman entropy of the
region R is given by the following Island formula:
Island formula :

S(R) = min extI Sgen (I ∪ R) ,

where the generalized entropy is given by the following expression

Generalized entropy :

(2.1)

:

Area(∂I)

Here I is the region in the gravitational system known as Island, Sm (I ∪ R) is the von
Neuman entropy of the region (I ∪R) and Sdiv (∂I) is the UV divergent entropy of boundary
of I i.e. ∂I. Island is a quantum extremal surface [47]. Region I is entangled with region
R i.e. degrees of freedom of I are encoded in R. It means that the operators in I can be
rewritten as operators in R no matter how complicated the form is.

Recently in refs. [56, 57] has shown the existence of Islands in higher dimensional spacetime as well. In his work [56, 57], he showed that islands can appear in 5D. Further in refs.
[58–60], Professor Robert C. Myers and co. also have studied quantum extremal Islands in
arbitrary space-time dimensions. Such Islands can exist even without the presence of black
holes. In this arbitrary dimensional D + 1 space-time the representative Island action can
be written as:

In this paper, we consider 3 + 1 dimensional space-time model to study the circuit complexity in FLRW Islands to have a realistic cosmological implications since our observed
universe is 3 + 1 dimensional. Recently, Hartman and collaborators in ref. [24] has studied
the presence of such Islands in 3 + 1 dimensional FLRW space-time.
In 3 + 1 dimensional FLRW cosmological space-time the representative Island action
can be expressed as:

Now, to extract the underlying the physical insight from the above mentioned model, we
need to perform conformal transform on the above mentioned action. This allows us to
express the Island action written in Jordan frame to the Einstein frame, which is given by:

The above mentioned transformed action is in perfect form to analyse the cosmological

to a canonical scalar field in the Einstein frame. This will further help us to study the
cosmological imprints from the above mentioned Island action expressed in FLRW spatially
flat (k = 0) background space-time. To avoid any confusion here it is important to note
that, for further computational purpose we will drop the ˜ symbol from our analysis which
actually distinguish the Einstein and Jordan frame explicitly.
The conditions for such Islands to appear in any gravitational space-time and quantum state are already discussed in greater detail in [24]. Below we just summarize the
conditions.
• Condition I :
Bekenstein area bound for entropy must be violated in the following way within
the Island prescription:

where

Usually, calculating entanglement entropy is not a very easy task. We want to bypass
this cumbersome task in a comparatively easy way by taking into account the use of circuit
complexity within the framework of FLRW Cosmology. We do not do any computation
from the gravitational theories to calculate the fine-grained entanglement entropy in the
presence of quantum extremal Islands. Instead of doing a complicated computation, we
consider the FLRW metric with radiation along with the negative (AdS) and positive (dS)
signature of the Cosmological Constant as our initial ingredient for the present computational purpose. To understand the effects of quantum mechanics, we, first of all, perturb
the usual classical FLRW metric in 3 + 1 dimensional space-time, out of which we will
consider only the scalar modes in this paper. In this paper, we study cosmological circuit
complexity from squeezed state formalism for both the cases of positive (dS) and negative
(AdS) cosmological constant with radiation and re-examine the Island paradigm in both
cases from a cosmology-complexity connecting point of view. We will explicitly show that,
cosmological circuit complexity for the AdS case will be exactly consistent with the Island
paradigm, which can able to produce the Page curve and resolve the well known black
hole information loss paradox without exactly computing any fine-grained gravitational
generalised entropy. This miracle happened because of the fact that the cosmological circuit complexity computed from the AdS FLRW Islands with radiation exactly captures all
the above mentioned three requirements very consistently, and the fine graining operation
is somehow inherent in the computation. This allows us to give a completely alternative
explanation of the resolution of this good old long standing problem from a completely
different, cosmology-complexity perspective. On the other hand, for completeness, we have
done the same analysis with the dS FLRW Islands with radiation and found that they are
not compatible with producing the Page curve. All of these claims will be more clear as
we proceed with the technical details of the subject material of study in the later sections
of this paper.

Circuit Complexity and the purposes it served

The general notion of circuit complexity refers to the minimum number of unitary
operations required to implement a given task, which is usually arriving at a desired final
state from a given initial state. Mathematically this operation can be represented by the
following expression:
Target state from initial reference state :

18

|ΨT i = U |ΨR i ,

(3.1)

where the representative unitary operation for the circuit complexity can be represented
by the n no of consecutive operations, as given by:

Unitary operator :

U=

n
Y

giα .

(3.2)

α=1

The choice of the circuit to implement the desired unitary transformation is, however,
not at all unique. Out of the infinite sequences that could produce the desired target
state from the given reference state, the complexity of a quantum circuit is given by the
sequence, which requires the minimum number of operations. The most challenging part
one faces identifying the optimal circuit from amongst the infinite number of possibilities.
In [61] the author suggests that the physical way of approaching this challenge is to find a
time-dependent Hamiltonian that synthesizes the desired unitary transformation U :

Unitary as path ordering :


 Z s
←
−
0
0
ds H(s )
U (s) = P exp −i
.

(3.3)

0

←
−
The variable s parametrizes a path in the space of unitaries and P indicates a path
ordering such that the Hamiltonian at the earlier times is applied to the first state. The
Hamiltonian H(s) can be expanded in terms of generalized Pauli matrices as,
Hamiltonian :

H(s) =

X

Y I (s)MI ,

(3.4)

I

where MI represents the generalised Pauli matrices, and the coefficients Y I (s) are the
control functions that decide the gate is acting on certain values of the parameters. These
control functions can be shown to act as the Hamiltonian in the Schrödinger equation
satisfied by the unitary operator, which can be written as:
Path evolution of unitary operator :

dU (s)
= −iY (s)I MI U (s) .
ds

(3.5)

The idea then is to define a cost for the various possible paths, minimizing which leads to
the identification of the optimal circuit. The cost functional used within this prescription
is defined as follows:
D(U (s)) =

Definition of cost functional :

19

Z

0

1

dt F (U (s), U̇ (s)) ,

(3.6)

where F is a local cost function depending on the position U (s) and the tangent vector Y I (s). Once the concept of the cost function is introduced, the problem is identical to finding the trajectory of a particle by minimizing the action from the Lagrangian
F (U (s), Y I (s)). Arguing that for a cost functional to be physically desirable, Nielson gave
a geometric interpretation of this notion of complexity [61]. He identified the problem of
finding the optimal circuit with the problem of finding extremal curves or geodesics in a
Finsler geometry, with the cost functional acting as the Finsler metric. Complexity is then
identified with the length of the geodesic.
Among the many known, the most studied cost functionals are the linearly weighted
and the geodesically weighted cost functional and are defined as
X
Linear cost functional :
F1 :=
|Y I (s)|,
(3.7)
I

Quadratic cost functional :

sX
F2 :=
(Y I (s))2 ,

(3.8)

I

The purpose of computing complexity from two different types of the cost functional
will enable us to comment on which cost functional is better for probing the underlying
quantum chaotic features of a system.
The readers might wonder about the role of a computational tool, namely circuit complexity in the study of Quantum extremal surfaces and most importantly in Cosmological
Islands and surely doubt why at all one should be interested in studying this prospect
where already the black hole information loss problem was shown to be already solved by
introducing the magical effects of Islands. But to motivate all the potential readers, we, all
the authors, urge all of them that please hold their breath till the end and to bear with us.
In the end, we might be able to convince everyone that complexity indeed serves a bigger
purpose than we think it can. To give some motivation about the necessity of complexity
in theoretical physics, we review here some of the important aspects of complexity that
has been used by many people in this field:
• Motivation I:
The motivation to study circuit complexity in high energy physics arose when it was
applied to quantum field theory and gravity sector [62–89], particularly from attempts
to apply AdS/CFT duality in certain black hole settings. Susskind et al. in ref. [16]
proposed ways of probing the interior regions of the black hole horizon. They showed
that these probes can be somehow related to a Quantum information-theoretic measure, namely, ”Complexity”. Two famous conjectures came into the picture, which
opened many new areas of research in the branch of theoretical physics connecting
condensed matter and high energy physics with quantum information science being

20

the heart. The two conjectures are famously known as the ”Complexity=Volume”
and ”Complexity= Action” [1, 90–92].
• Motivation II:
Apart from its use in the gravity sector, the notion of circuit complexity has found
its application in various other areas. Having a close relation with the Out of timeordered correlation functions (OTOC’s) circuit complexity has recently been used
as a diagnostic of quantum chaos and randomness [93, 94]. Complexity has been
found to provide many important details that are of utmost significance when one
speaks about a chaotic system. It can be used to predict the Lyapunov exponent [95],
scrambling time [96], equilibrium temperature, and many other important properties
of a chaotic system.
• Motivation III:
Recently people have tried to study and quantify chaos in different cosmological
frameworks using the notion of circuit complexity and OTOC’s [17–20, 97].
Keeping in mind all of these various applications of circuit complexity, we used it in a
more fruitful direction by recognizing a closed relation between circuit complexity and fie
grained entanglement entropy of evaporating black hole as suggested by Prof. Susskind [16].
We propose a closed relation between circuit complexity, Out of time ordered correlation
functions (OTOC’s), and entanglement entropy. Thus we finally suggest that for any
gravitational model without indulging in the computation of entanglement entropy, one
can comment on it by computing the circuit complexity. The details of the closed relation
can be found in Sec. 6

Cosmological models for Islands

In this section, we briefly discuss about the magical cosmological models that we are
considering in this paper by following ref. [24]. We consider the solution of FLRW cosmology with radiation along with the negative (AdS) and positive (dS) cosmological constant.

Quantum Complexity from squeezed quantum states
Squeezed states from perturbation FLRW cosmology

In this section, we will study squeezed state formalism within the framework of cosmological perturbation theory for FLRW spatially flat background. As already discussed
in the earlier section, we consider the Island action in the 3+1 dimension in the Einstein
frame given by
Z

1
SE =
dτ d3 x a4 (τ ) R + (∂φ)2 − 2V (φ)
(5.1)

We again remind the reader that in the above equation, we have deliberately removed the
tilde sign from the field variable for the sake of notational simplicity. It is to be noted
that the field variable φ in the above equation represents the redefined field in the Einstein

24

frame. We now consider the following perturbation in the scalar field:
φ(x, τ ) = φ(τ ) + δφ(x, τ )

(5.2)

and the whole dynamics can be expressed in terms of a gauge invariant description through
a variable given by:
ζ(x, τ ) = − 

H(τ )
 δφ(x, t).
dφ(τ )
dτ

(5.3)

We fix some gauge constraints that re-parametrizes space-time for the first order perturbation theory:
δφ(x, τ ) = 0, gij (x, τ ) = a2 (τ ) [(1 + 2ζ(x, τ )) δij + hij (x, τ )] , ∂i hij (x, τ ) = 0 = hii (x, τ ),
This gauge, conserves the curvature perturbation variable is outside the horizon.
We apply ADM formalism to compute the second-order perturbed action for scalar
modes. The action, after gauge fixing is:

To re-parametrize the second-order perturbed action, we introduce the following space-time
dependent variable:
v(x, τ ) = z(τ ) ζ(x, τ ),

p
where z(τ ) = a(τ ) (τ ),

(5.6)

which transforms the perturbed action to a familiar form of canonical scalar field. This is
known as the Mukhanov variable. Additionally, note that the newly defined quantity, (τ )

We vary the second-order perturbed action with respect to the perturbed field variable in
the Fourier space, and we get:
vk00 (τ ) + ω 2 (k, τ )vk (τ ) = 0.

(5.13)

This is known as the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation and represents the classical equation of
motion of a parametric oscillator where the frequency of the oscillator is conformal time
dependent and in the present context of discussion, given by :
ω 2 (k, τ ) := k 2 + m2eff (τ ),

The conformal time dependent mass parameter can be calculated for the two models considered in this paper as follows. In the Friedman equations the effective fluid in
the presence of radiation and a negative (AdS) / positive (dS) cosmological constant are

Squeezed state formalism in Island Cosmology

Following [98, 99], we factorize the unitary evolution operator produced by the above
Hamiltonian U, as follows
U(τ, τ0 ) = Ŝ(rk (τ, τ0 ), φk (τ ))R̂(θk (τ )),
where R is the two mode rotation operator, defined as:
R̂(θk (τ )) = exp −iθk (τ ) âk â†k + â†−k â−k

!


(5.55)

,

(5.56)

and Ŝ is the two-mode squeezing operator, defined as:
Ŝ(rk (τ ), φk (τ )) = exp

!


rk (τ )
exp(−2iφk (τ ))âk â−k − exp(2iφk (τ ))â†−k â†k .
2

(5.57)

The time-dependent parameters, rk (τ ) and φk (τ ) describes the squeezing amplitude and
the squeezing angle respectively. The two-mode rotation operator, R̂ also produces an

33

irrelevant phase factor exp(iθk (τ )) while acted upon the initial quantum vacuum state and
can be safely ignored. The appearance of the squeezed quantum state can be realised
through the interaction of the cosmological perturbation with the conformal time dependent scale factor. This leads to a conformal time dependent frequency for the parametric
oscillator, whose quantization is described in terms of the two mode squeezed state formalism as described in [98]. We choose the ground state of the free Hamiltonian as the
initial quantum mechanical state:
âk |0ik,−k = 0

∀ k,

(5.58)

which is basically a Poincare invariant vacuum state in the present context of discussion.
The action of the squeezed quantum operator Ŝ on the above initial vacuum state
produces a two-mode squeezed quantum vacuum state, as:
|Ψsq ik,−k = Ŝ(rk (τ ), φk (τ )) |0ik,−k

given by the following expression:
|nk , n−k i =

1 † n † n
â
â−k |0ik,−k .

(5.60)

Consequently, in the present context of discussion the full quantum wave function can be
expressed in terms of the product of the wave function for each two-mode pair as k, −k
given by the following expression:

Time evolution in squeezed state formalism

We begin by expressing the creation and annihilation operators of the parametric oscillator in terms of the squeezed states and using the factorized form of the unitary operator
introduced in the previous subsection, the expression for the creation and annihilation

34

operator can be written at any arbitrary time scale as:
âk (τ ) = Û † (τ, τ0 ) âk Û(τ, τ0 )

= R̂† (θk (τ ))Ŝ † (rk (τ ), φk (τ )) âk R̂(θk (τ ))Ŝ(rk (τ ), φk (τ ))

= cosh rk (τ ) exp(−iθk (τ )) âk − sinh rk (τ ) exp(i(θk (τ ) + 2φk (τ ))) â†−k , (5.62)

â†−k (τ ) = Û † (τ, τ0 ) â†−k Û(τ, τ0 )

= R̂† (θk (τ ))Ŝ † (rk (τ ), φk (τ )) â†−k R̂(θk (τ ))Ŝ(rk (τ ), φk (τ ))

= cosh rk (τ ) exp(iθk (τ )) â†−k − sinh rk (τ ) exp(−i(θk (τ ) + 2φk (τ ))) âk . (5.63)

Consequently, the quantum operator associated with the cosmological perturbation field
variable for the scalar fluctuation and the its canonically conjugate momenta can be expressed as:

v̂k (τ ) = vk (τ0 ) âk (τ ) + â†−k (τ )

Quantum complexity from squeezed quantum states in Island cosmology

To compute the complexity from squeezed formalism we use the wave function formalism
of computing circuit complexity developed by [62] and used extensively in [18, 19, 63]. We
fix a reference state |0ik,−k , commonly used in cosmological perturbations. The squeezed
two-mode vacuum state |Ψsq ik,−k becomes the target state.
The reference two-mode vacuum state wave function is given by:
âk |0ik,−k = 0 ∀ k

(5.72)

which has the following usual Gaussian structure:

where we have used the expression for Ωk in the sub-Hubble region, that we analytically
approximated.
By noting that a specific squeezing parameters with the annihilation and creation operators fixes the wave function we can write it as:

cosh rk (τ ) âk + exp(−2iφk (τ )) sinh rk (τ ) â†−k |Ψsq ik,−k = 0.

Connecting Complexity with fine grained entropy

Concept of complexity was introduced by Prof Leonard Susskind in an attempt to solve
black hole puzzles. It was based on the observation that the spatial volume of Einstein
Rosen bridge keeps on growing forever where as the entropy attains saturation in a quick
time in AdS black hole. A correspondence exists in black hole physics and quantum circuit
physics; the black hole entropy S corresponds to number of qubits (Let’s say K) in the
quantum circuit and Rindler time t corresponds to clock time of quantum circuit [16].
Using this correspondence the following relationship for complexity with entropy can be
derived
 
dC

S
where β =
with kB = 1.
(6.1)
= ST =
dt
β
T
 
1 dC
This shows us that
when plotted is expected to have the similar features as
T dt
Entropy S. As discussed earlier, the computation of entanglement entropy is not a trivial

doing certain manipulations it can be shown that the above relation can be expressed in
terms of the scale factor (which gives us all the relevant information about the space-time
we are dealing with) in the context of Cosmology. Keeping this in mind we write equation

(6.10)

From the above calculation, it is easy to see that there exist a relationship between
complexity and entropy. We will explicitly examine this in the following section where we
consider four dimensional FLRW cosmology with radiation and positive/negative cosmological constant.

Magical effects in Numerical study with Cosmological Islands

In this section, our objective is to numerically solve the time evolution differential
equations satisfied by the squeezed state parameters. To do so, we have used the scale
factor as the dynamical variable insted of the conformal time which makes our computation
physically justifiable. This change in variable is commonly known as field redifinition. Once
we solve the differential equations, it will enable us to compute the circuit complexity
between two reference states, within the framework of cosmological perturbation theory,
in which the effects of quantum fluctuations are treated in terms of squeezed states. We

39

numerically plot the complexities calculated from two different cost functionals for both
the models of the cosmological scale factors. Using the logic given in [17], we write the
expression for the complexity in the exponentially increasing region as
Ci (a) ≈ ci exp(λi a)a=aexp

∀ i = 1, 2

(7.1)

It is to be noted that the above equation is valid only for the exponentially rising region,
hence the subscript aexp has been used, which we indeed observe for both the measure of
complexity in both models of scale factor. The index ”i” in the above equation indicates
which measure of complexity is being used. The slopes and the amplitudes are written
with the index i to indicate that they are in general different for different models being
considered. Mathematically, this can be represented as

λi =



d ln Ci (a)
da



∀

i = 1, 2,

(7.2)

One can also conjecture a similar relation between OTOC and complexity for the exponentially rising region keeping in mind that in general complexity and OTOC are related
by C = −ln(OT OC). Hence for the exponentially rising region, the out-of-time ordered
correlation function can be written as
OTOC ≈ exp(−c exp(λa))

(7.3)

In reference [17], the authors identified the slope λ as the quantum Lyapunov exponent
which captures the effect of chaos in the quantum regime and showed the existence of a
universal relation between the different measures of complexity. It is represented as
C = − ln (OTOC) ≈ Ci ∀ i = 1, 2

(7.4)

The above universal relation between the complexities can be translated to the Lyapunov
exponent through the MSS bound. Thus,
λi - λ ≤

2π
∀ i = 1, 2
β

(7.5)

This relation can further be used to estimate the lower bound on the equilibrium tem-

40

perature, which can be done using the following relation
λi

∀ i = 1, 2
2π

=⇒



d ln Ci (a)



a=aexp

∀ i = 1, 2

(7.6)

For our purpose, we have numerically estimated the values of the Lyapunov exponents
for the both the models of scale factors using the following relation
λi =

ln Ci (apeak ) − ln Ci (arise )
apeak − arise

(7.7)

The use of above relation simplifies our task and prevents complicacies of implementing
numerical differentiation. Furthermore, using the relation between the circuit complexity
and entanglement entropy we numerically plotted the entropy wrt the scale factor.

• Once the complexity measures C1 and C2 are identified with the fine grained entanglement entropy and their respective plots with the unitary Page Curve, one might
be tempted to figure out how does the Hawking-Page transition scale changes with
different complexity measures. Below we provide the Hawking-Page transition scale
calculated numerically from the complexity measures C1 and C2 .
• From Table 7.3 it can be seen that the scale factor at which the Hawking-Page phase
transition point takes place is independent of the cost functional used to calculate the
complexity measure. This should not come as a surprise because of the uniqueness
of the Hawking-Page Phase transition point. It should only be a function of the

uniform and smooth peak at the top.
– The initial rise in C1 is more linear when compared to the initial rising part of
C2 . We also observe the rise begins a little later in the case of C2 .
• The general trend that we observe for the family of complexity values is that it
initially rises, reaches a peak and then falls down. The most peculiar difference in
this case is the deviation at particular values of scale factor for each cosmological
constant. Although the overall trend resembles a page curve, one can not associate
a page curve with the sinh model, due to the deviation at the cut off value. The
values become unsolvable signifying a blow up or erratic behaviour after a point.
Hence it is not a smooth page curve although initial trend resembles the Page Curve.
This further points to the fact that there are no Island in this model.
• Fig. 7.13 and Fig. 7.14 shows the plots of Out-of-Time-Ordered correlation functions.
Up to a certain value of scale factor the OTOC’s decreases exponentially. However
after a certain transition scale factor it starts increasing exponentially. Here too, we
observe the deviations of the curve after a given value of scale factor for a chosen
value of cosmological constant.
Table 7.5 shows the value of the Lyapunov exponents calculated for the the initial exponentially rising region before the transition scale factor. The family of complexity curves
follow very similar trend during the rising portion. Estimating the Lyapunov exponent
using point of initial rise, and saturation all gives very similar values. There are slight

Table 7.6 shows the values of the equilibrium temperature as predicted by the different
complexity measures for the exponentially rising region of the plots. We observe deviations
only after a few decimal places and they are only significant in smaller values of cosmological constant and higher cost functional family. This shows higher sensitivity of smaller
cosmological constant, and higher order cost functional.
Table 7.7 summarizes all our important conclusions from the study of the two cosmological scale factors, one has an island and the other does not. The most vital point to note
is that the numerically computed circuit complexity for the AdS+Radiation model (have
islands) produces using the squeezed state formalism when plotted wrt the scale factor
have an identical behaviour as that of the Page curve followed by an evaporating black
hole. On the other hand the dS+Radiation model (without islands) does not reproduce
the Page curve.

Magical Conclusion and Prospects
From our study of cosmological Islands we have the following final magical remarks:
• Remark I:
The notion of circuit complexity and OTOC has a deep connection with the fine
grained entanglement entropy of evaporating black hole and for the case of maximal chaos a closed relation can be established explicitly in between them, and we
have shown the existence of such miracle relation in this paper. Thus without going

Table 7.7: Comparative study of the two models of scale factors considered in this paper
into the computational details of the fine grained entanglement entropy from the
gravitational paradigm one can comment on this mesmerizing issue just by knowing the circuit complexity within the framework of spatially flat FLRW cosmology
in presence of quantum extremal Islands, having AdS with radiation and dS with
radiation.
• Remark II:
Using the established relation between complexity and fine grained quantum entanglement entropy as the guiding principle it has been shown that with the introduction
of Quantum extremal islands in FLRW cosmology, the complexity plots reproduces
the Page Curve for the case AdS with radiation, which preserve the unitary in the
evaporating black hole and resolves the good old information loss paradox.
• Remark III:
The complexity plots from higher order homogeneous κ family shows that though
they may be a better measure from the perspective of chaos but from the perspective of reproducing the Page Curve the linearly weighted and geodesically weighted
complexity measures are better.
• Remark IV:
Without any surprise at the Hawking-Page phase transition point the scale factor is

52

only dependent on the model parameter values and independent of the cost functional
used to calculate the complexity measure in this paper.
• Remark V:
The Quantum Lyapunov exponent and equilibrium temperature has been calculated
from different complexity measures satisfies the universality relation established in
ref. [17], which is our previous work in this direction.
• Remark VI:
The complexity plots done with dS with radiation in FLRW cosmology does not
reproduce the unitary page curve. Thu, particularly for this case will not able to
solve the information loss paradox.
• Remark VII:
In Sine hyperbolic model (without islands) one can see the initial portion of the
complexity curve resembling a Page curve, but due to the deviation at different cutoff values of scale factor, during the decreasing part, we cannot associate a page time
to this model. So ultimately such model will not serve the purpose.
• Remark VIII:
In the case without Islands, the Lyapunov exponent (and the equilibrium Temperature) show very slight deviation due to the initial rising period being more or less
same.
• Remark XI:
Last but not the least, the presented computation in this paper helps us to address
a long standing big challenging issue without going to the computational details and
dealing various difficulties. For this purpose the well known squeezed state formalism
in cosmological perturbation theory helps a lot to predict the correct expression for
the circuit complexity within the framework of spatially flat FLRW Cosmology. Not
only that, but also the closed connecting relationship established in this paper, which
we actually identify as some sort of miracle helps us to make a bridge between chaosblack hole physics and chaos-complexity within the framework of spatially flat FLRW
Cosmology. We have found that, maximal chaos in the quantum regime is a very very
useful framework makes this complicated task very very easy and acted as the source
of the main magical conclusion which solves this good old long standing black hole
information loss paradox within the framework of spatially flat FLRW Cosmology,
having negative Cosmological Constant and radiation in the component of the total
energy density.
The future prospects of the present work are appended below:

53

• Prospect I:
As discussed earlier, apart from the quantum extremal surface or Island prescription,
other proposals have also been suggested to solve the black hole information paradox.
However none of them have been studied using the notion of circuit complexity and
OTOC. A very intuitive study will be to try and predict the fine grained entanglement
entropy from the computation of circuit complexity for the other proposals as well.
One can then comment on the best proposal for reproducing the page curve from the
perspective of Circuit complexity and OTOC.
• Prospect II:
It is a well known fact that black holes are highly chaotic systems. One can then
ask the question that from the perspective of black hole chaos which one is a better
proposal in not only reproducing the page curve but also revealing the chaotic features
of black holes. This question can be addressed from the study of circuit complexity
and OTOC, which are the most relevant probes of quantum chaos.
• Prospect III:
An extension of the present work can be done for the primordial gravitational waves
which will require the inclusion of the tensor mode fluctuations generated from a
cosmological perturbations in the spatially flat FLRW background rather than the
scalar modes considered in this case. It would be an interesting study as to how
the two mode squeezed state formalism brings about the phenomenon of chaos and
complexity in primordial gravitational waves.
• Prospect IV:
A model independent notion of circuit complexity can be given from the perspective
of Effective Field theory, where one starts from a single EFT action and derives all
models under various constraints satisfied by the parameters of the action. Squeezed
state formalism for such a universal action can be developed to generalize an give a
model-independent prescription of complexity.
• Prospect V:
Recently there has been a study of the Islands contribution in the Entanglement negativity [100]. This motivates us to rethink various entanglement related phenomenon
studied in [101–104] and whether those aspects can be studied from the perspective
of Islands.
• Prospect VI:
Recently there has been a lot of studies in the field of Open Quantum Systems [105–
107]. It is a natural to expect that an OQS will exhibit chaotic behaviour due to its
constant interaction with its immediate surroundings. One can utilize the concept
of circuit complexity and OTOC to probe the chaos shown by an OQS.

Horizon constraints on the FLRW cosmological Islands

constraint this places on the scale factor, when we consider the Cosmological Horizon for
Islands. The cosmological Horizon is given by

Dispersion relation in Cosmological Islands

In this appendix, our prime objective is to derive the expression for the dispersion
relation in terms of the squeezed parameter rk (τ ) and the squeezed angle φk (τ ), where the
dispersion relation appears in the Hamiltonian after quantization that we studied in the
paper explicitly.
Let us first write down the expression for the conformal time dependent dispersion
relation Ωk in terms of the canonical field variable and its associated canonically conjugate
momentum that appears after performing the cosmological perturbation theory for a single
scalar field:

vk (τ ) = vk (τ0 ) cosh rk (τ ) exp(iθk (τ )) − sinh rk (τ ) exp(i(θk (τ ) + 2φk (τ ))) ,

πk (τ ) = πk (τ0 ) cosh rk (τ ) exp(iθk (τ )) + sinh rk (τ ) exp(i(θk (τ ) + 2φk (τ ))) ,

Now we consider a specific situation in the time line of our FLRW universe, where it
is expected to have very small contribution from the squeezed parameter, rk (τ ) for which

59

one can use the following approximations:
cosh rk (τ ) ≈ 1,

sinh rk (τ ) ≈ rk (τ ).

(B.15)

Consequently, we get the following result for the Island dispersion relation:

which is basically dependent on the co-moving wave number and the time dependent
quantity νisland . Further, if we assume that the contributions appearing through the factors
∆AdS (a) and ∆dS (a) are appearing as a correction terms due to its smallness the by applying
the Binomial approximation the conformal time dependent generalised mass parameter
νisland can be approximately written by considering the contribution upto the next-toleading order term as:
