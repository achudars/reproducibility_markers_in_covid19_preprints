Knowing the infection fatality ratio (IFR) is crucial for epidemic management: for immediate planning; for
balancing the life years saved against those lost to the consequences of management; and for evaluating the ethics
of paying substantially more to save a life year from the epidemic than from other diseases. Impressively, Verity
et al. (2020) rapidly assembled case data and used statistical modelling to infer the IFR for COVID-19. We have
attempted an in-depth statistical review of their paper, eschewing statistical nit-picking, but attempting to identify
the extent to which the (necessarily compromised) data are more informative about the IFR than the modelling
assumptions. First the data.
• Individual level data for outside China appear problematic, because different countries have differing levels
of ascertainment and different disease-severity thresholds even for classification as a case. Their use in
IFR estimation would require country-specific model ascertainment parameters, about which we have no
information. Consequently these data provide no useful information on IFR.
• Repatriation flight data provide the sole information on Wuhan prevalence (excepting the lower bound
of confirmed cases). 689 foreign nationals eligible for repatriation are doubtfully representative of the
susceptible population of Wuhan. Hence it is hard to see how to usefully incorporate the 6 positive cases
from this sample.
• Case-mortality data from China provide an upper bound for IFR, and, with extra assumptions, on the age
dependence of IFR. Since prevalence is unknown, they contain no information for estimating the absolute
IFR magnitude.
• Because of extensive testing, the Diamond Princess (used only for validation by Verity et al.) supplies data
on both infections and symptomatic cases, with fewer ascertainment problems. These data appear directly
informative about IFR. Against this, the co-morbidity load on the DP is unlikely to fully represent any
population of serious interest (perhaps fewer very severe but more milder co-morbidities).
Secondly, the modelling assumptions: we see two primary problems.
1. Verity et al. correct the Chinese case data by assuming that ascertainment differences across age groups
determine case rate differences. Outside Wuhan they replace observed case data by the cases that would
have occurred if each age group had the same per-capita observed case rate as the 50-59 group. They
assume complete ascertainment for the 50-59s. These are very strong modelling assumptions that will
greatly affect the results: but the published uncertainty bounds reflect no uncertainty about them. In Wuhan,
the complete ascertainment assumption is relaxed by introducing a parameter, but one for which the data
appear uninformative, so the results will be driven by the assumed uncertainty.
2. Generically, Bayesian models describe uncertainty both in the data and in prior beliefs about the studied
system. Only when data are informative about the targets of modelling can we be sure that prior beliefs play
a small role in what the model tells us about the world. In this case the data are especially uninformative:
we suspect results are mostly the consequence of what our prior beliefs were.
Taken together these problems indicate that Verity et al.s IFRs should be treated very cautiously when planning.
While awaiting actual measurements, we would base IFRs on the DP data, with the Chinese case-fatality data
informing the dependence of IFR on age: in supplementary material we provide a crude Bayesian model with
its IFR estimates by age. Corresponding population IFR estimates and 95% credible intervals are China: 0.43%
(.23,.65), UK: 0.55% (.30,.82); India 0.20% (.11,.30). The strong assumptions required, by this approach too,
emphasize the need for improved data. We should replace complex models of inadequate clinical data, with
simpler models of epidemiological prevalence data from appropriately designed random sampling using antibody
or PCR tests.

A crude IFR model

We attempt to construct a model for the Diamond Princess (henceforth DP) data and aggregated data
from China, with the intention that the DP data informs the absolute magnitude of the IFR while the
China data contributes to the estimation of relative IFR by age class. For the Diamond Princess we lump
the 80-89 and 90+ age groups into an 80+ group to match the China data, noting that there are no deaths
in the 90+ group. We obtained the age of death of the 12 cases from the Diamond Princess Wikipedia
page, checking the news reports on which the information was based. One case has no age reported
except that he was an adult. Given that there was no mention of a young victim we have assumed that he
was 50 or over.
We adopt the assumptions of Verity et al. (2020) of a constant attack rate with age, and that there
is perfect ascertainment in one age class, but assume that this is the 80+ age group for the DP. The
assumption seems more tenable for the DP population than for China, given that 4003 PCR tests were
administered to the 3711 people on board, with the symptomatic and elderly tending to be tested first.
However given that the tests were not administered weekly to all people not yet tested positive, from
the start of the outbreak, and that the tests are not 100% reliable, the assumption is still unlikely to be
perfect, which may bias results upwards. Unlike Verity et al. (2020) we do not correct the case data,
but adopt a simple model for under-ascertainment by age, allowing some, but by no means all, of the
uncertainty associated with this assumption to be reflected in the intervals reported below. We then
model a proportion of the potentially detectable cases as being symptomatic, making a second strong
assumption that this rate is constant across age classes. This assumption is made because the data only
tell us that there were 314 symptomatic cases among 706 positive tests but not their ages, so we have
no information to further distinguish age specific under-ascertainment and age specific rates of being
asymptomatic. We then adopt a simple model for the probability of death with age (quadratic on the
logit scale).
For the China data we necessarily use a different attack rate to the DP, but the same model as the
DP to go from infected to symptomatic cases (on the basis that this reflects an intrinsic characteristic of
the infectious disease). However we assume that only a proportion of symptomatic cases are detected (at
least relative to whatever threshold counted as symptomatic on the DP). Furthermore we are forced to
adopt a modified ascertainment model for China, and correct for the difference between this and the DP
ascertainment model, within the sub-model for China. We assume the same death rates for symptomatic
cases in China, but apply the Verity et al. (2020) correction for not-yet-occurred deaths, based on their
fitted Gamma model, treating this correction as fixed.

Technical details of the crude IFR model

2.1

Diamond Princess component

In detail, starting with the Diamond Princess, let α be the infection probability, constant for all age
classes, pci the probability of an infection to be detectable in age class i, psi the probability that a detectable

case develops symptoms and pdi the probability that a symptomatic case dies. pci psi pdi is the IFR for age
class i. Let ai denote the lower age boundary of class i. The models are (i) for the detectability probability
2 / exp(γ )
2

pci = γ1 + (1 − γ1 )e−(ai −80)

.

Note the assumption that all cases in the oldest age class are ascertained; (ii) a constant symptomatic
probability model,
psi = φ,
and (iii) for the probability that a symptomatic case dies,
logit(pdi ) = β1 + β2 (ai − 40) + β3 (ai − 40)2 .
For a case to be recorded on the DP, the person needed to be attacked by the virus, gotten ill and detected
at the right moment. In principle, this means that the number of cases in age class i is distributed as a
binom(pci α, ni ), where pci α is the probability of gotten ill and detected, and ni is the number of people
in age class i on the DP. However, as only 619 out of the 706 cases have their age recorded, we split the
cases into
Ci ∼ binom(pci α, ni 619/706) and Ci+ ∼ binom(pci α, ni (1 − 619/706))
where Ci are the observed cases of known age and Ci+ are the additional cases, assumed to follow the
same age distribution, but not actually recorded by age. Binomial parameters are rounded appropriately.
Letting Si denote the symptomatics among the cases in age group i, we have
Si ∼ binom(psi , Ci + Ci+ ).
The deaths among the symptomatics of known age are distributed as
Di ∼ binom(psi , Si hi )
where hi is the probability of being of known age on death (this is treated as fixed at 1 for ages less than
50, and 11/12 for 50+ given the one victim on the DP for which no age was recorded, except that he
was an adult). For the deaths of unknown age,
P Dna , (there is one of these) among the symptomatics of
unknown age (an artificial category) Sna = i (1 − hi )Si , we have
Dna ∼ binom(pna , Sna )
P
where the probability ofP
death is pna = i (1 − hi )Si pdi /Sna . Finally the total number of symptomatics
is modelled as St ∼ N ( i Si , 52 ), allowing some limited uncertainty in the symptomatic/asymptomatic
classification.
The actual available data on the DP are St , Dna and {Ci , ni , Di }80
i=0 .

2.2

The Chinese component

Moving on to the Chinese data, the assumption is that the patterns with age with respect to detection (pci ),
to being symptomatic (psi ) and to death (pdi ) are similar, but the attack rate α̃ for China is different. Let
Ni be the population size in age class i and S̃i the symptomatics. Then
S̃i ∼ binom(α̃pci psi Ni ).

DP deaths

Figure 1: Posterior predictive distribution of the number of deaths on the Diamond Princess. The vertical
red line is the actual number of deaths.
Unlike on the DP, only a fraction δi of the symptomatics are tested to become cases,
C̃i ∼ binom(δi , S̃i )
and the (observed) deaths are then distributed as
D̃i ∼ binom(pdi pyi /δi , C̃i )
where pyi is the average probability of a case in class i having died yet, given they will die — this was
treated as a fixed correction and is computed from the Verity et al. (2020) estimated Gamma model
of time from onset to death, and the known onset times for the cases. The scaling by δi ensures that
c
cc
pdi maintains the same meaning between DP and China. We model δi as δi = δpcc
i /pi where pi is an
cc
attempt to capture the shape of the actual China detectability with age and is defined as pi = exp{−(ai −
65)2 /eγc }.

2.3

Priors and posteriors

We define the following priors using precision and not variance when defining normal densities:
α ∼ U (.1, .9), γ1 ∼ U (.01, .99), γ2 ∼ N (7.2, .001),
φ ∼ U (.1, .9), β1 ∼ N (−3.5, .001), β2 ∼ N (0, .001), β3 ∼ N (0, .001),
α̃ ∼ U (10−4 , .5), δ ∼ U (.1, .9), γc ∼ N (7.4, .01).
This structure uses the information from the DP to assess the symptomatic rate and hidden case
rate and the scale of the death probabilities, while the China data refines the information on how death
rates change with age. It is possible to formulate a model in which the China data appear to contribute
to inference about absolute levels of mortality, but this model is completely driven by the prior put on
proportion of cases observed (about which the China data are completely uninformative).
The model was implemented in JAGS 4.3.0. Mixing is slow, but 5×107 steps, retaining every 2500th
sample, gives an effective sample size of about 660 for δ, the slowest moving parameter. We discarded
the first 2000 retained samples as burn in, although diagnostic plots show no sign that this is necessary.

Table 1: Posterior median and credible intervals of Infection Fatality Ratio for various groups. We
believe the credible intervals to be optimistically narrow.
Posterior predictive distribution plots are shown in Figure 2. We note the problems with young Chinese
detected cases, although even the most extreme mismatch only corresponds to a factor of 2 IFR change, if
reflecting incorrect numbers of actual cases. In older groups the model cases are a little high on average,
but not by enough to suggest much change in IFR. These mismatches might be reduced by better models
for the ascertainment proportion by age. Figure 1 shows the posterior predictive distribution for total
Diamond Princess deaths with the actual deaths as a thick red bar.
The median and credible intervals for the IFR as percentages in various groups are in Table 1. They
show different estimates of this crucial quantity compared to Verity et al. (2020), again emphasising the
urgent need for statistically principled sampling data to directly measure prevalence, instead of having to
rely on complex models of problematic data with strong built in assumptions.
