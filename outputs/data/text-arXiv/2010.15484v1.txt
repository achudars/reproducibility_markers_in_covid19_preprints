Abstract
Introduction Food insecurity is associated with increased risk for several health conditions and with
increased national burden of chronic disease. Key determinants for household food insecurity are
income and food costs. Forecasts show household disposable income for 2020 expected to fall and
for 2021 to rise only slightly. Prices in the same periods are forecast to rise. Thus, future increased
food prices would be a significant driver of greater food insecurity.
Objectives To investigate food price drivers for household food security and its health consequences
in the United Kingdom under three different agreement scenarios for the end of the transition
period for Britain’s exit from the European Union, in December 2020. To estimate the means,
medians and 5th percentile and 95th percentile quantiles of projected food basket price distributions
by April 2022, which would result from each agreement scenario.
Design Structured expert judgement elicitation, a well-established method for quantifying
uncertainty, using experts. In July 2020, each expert estimated the median, 5th percentile and 95th
percentile quantiles of changes in price to April 2022 for ten food categories under three end-2020
settlement Brexit scenarios: A: full WTO terms; B: a moderately disruptive trade agreement (better
than WTO); C: a minimally disruptive trade agreement. These scenario price quantiles are
enumerated from the judgements of a group of experts, aggregated with performance scores based
on the statistical accuracy and informativeness of the experts, as determined with a set of
calibration items.
Participants Eight specialists with expertise in food procurement, retail, agriculture, economics,
statistics and household food security.
Results When combined in proportions used to calculate Consumer Prices Index food basket costs,
the median food price change under full WTO terms is expected to be +17.9% [90% credible
interval:+5.2%, +35.1%]; with moderately disruptive trade agreement: +13.2% [+2.6%, +26.4%] and
with a minimally disruptive trade agreement +9.3% [+0.8%, +21.9%].
Conclusions The number of households experiencing food insecurity and its severity are likely to
increase because of expected sizeable increases in median food prices in the months after Brexit,
whereas low income group spending on food is unlikely to increase, and may be further eroded by
other factors not considered here (e.g. COVID-19). Higher increases are more likely than lower rises
and towards the upper limits, these would entail severe impacts. Research showing a low food
budget leads to increasingly poor diet suggests that demand for health services in both the short and
longer term is likely to increase due to the effects of food insecurity on the incidence and
management of diet-sensitive conditions.

Introduction
Food insecurity, the lack of access to sufficient nutritious food, is associated with multiple negative
outcomes including diet-sensitive chronic diseases. An important driver of household food insecurity
is the costs of food and other essentials relative to incomes. In 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) voted
to relinquish its membership of the European Union (EU), known colloquially as ‘Brexit’, and the
transition period is due to end on 31st December 2020. UK reliance on food imports, including from
EU, is significant and food price rises have been widely forecast [1].
In March 2020, we published the results of an expert elicitation undertaken in July 2018 for food prices
to June 2020, under the key assumption that Brexit would take place on 29th March 2019, as originally
intended [2]. Subsequently, eight of the same experts provided updated estimates, between March
and August 2020, taking into account the changed Brexit delivery timescale but excluding the
confounding impact of COVID-19 on food supply. This is reasonable since the food supply shortages
seen at the beginning of the UK lockdown resulted from the inability of the UK just-in-time food supply
to cope with the uptick in demand driven by the lockdown, when households stocked up for the
possibility of self-isolation due to COVID19 [3] and spent more on eating at home, instead of using
restaurants and other outside food providers.

Methods
In the updated analysis, we chose three possible Brexit scenarios instead of the two (“deal” or “nodeal”) in the original investigation. This is to reflect the change of political landscape, including the
fact that the UK has now formally left the EU and is in a transition period, negotiating alternative trade
arrangements. The three Scenarios are: A: full WTO terms, (broadly similar to no-deal); B: a nonspecific but moderately disruptive trade agreement (better than WTO); C: a minimally disruptive trade
agreement (broadly similar to the arrangements under EU membership). We also asked our panel of
experts for their views on the relative likelihood of each of these three scenarios being realised.
The expert elicitation was carried out using the same method as before [2]. The experts’ estimates
were combined under the Cooke protocol and the combined estimates of food price changes in the
10 categories in the CPI calculation, under each of the three scenarios, are shown in Table 1. We
estimated the cost changes for the CPI basket and the ‘healthy baskets’ from MacMahon & Weld [4]
for a family of four and for a single pensioner, containing slightly differing proportions of food
category items in each. We updated the baseline basket costs to July 2020, using ONS historic
inflation data [5]. These July 2020 costs were then projected to end December 2020 using a
Gaussian distribution derived from the last five years’ July-to-December overall food price change
data. Subsequent food price changes, from December 2020 to April 2022, were calculated from the
elicitation findings via the Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model we used previously [2].

Results
The different food category prices show different patterns of future change under the three Brexit
scenarios which our experts considered.
Three food categories (Coffee, Tea & cocoa; Soft drinks etc.; Sugar, jam, etc.) are expected to have
similar price rises under any of the scenarios.
Three food categories (Vegetables; Fruit; Milk, cheese & eggs) show substantial differences across
the scenarios, with the minimally disruptive scenario producing smaller median price rises of around
+5%. Given these are important food groups for health and that even a +5% price rise can be
significant for those on low incomes, and for a large number of households, this may produce

adverse long and short term national health outcomes, as described in [2]. The moderately
disruptive Scenario B shows median price rises around +10% to +15% for these categories and the
full WTO terms Scenario A shows median price rises around +16% to +24%. The higher the price
rises on essential, staple foods, the greater the number of households that will be affected.
Three food categories (Oils & fats; Fish; Bread & cereals) show a pattern where the difference
between median price increases under Scenario C versus Scenario B are more substantial than
between Scenario B and Scenario A. That said, in each case, the 90% credible interval under
Scenario C contains the medians of Scenarios B and A. Fish and Bread & cereals are also very
important food groups for health, and the same comment applies as for Vegetable, Fruit and dairy,
such that even the smallest median increases could have substantial impacts of the lowest income
households.
Meat is the category showing the highest median price increase under Scenario C and this category
cost also rises slightly under the other two scenarios. In many diets, meat is an important source of
protein, and a price increase on the scale of Scenario C is likely to lead to a move towards lowerquality meat for lower-income households. It is possible that it will also accelerate moves towards
vegetarian diets, although the taste of meat and animal products is enough of a barrier to prevent
dietary change for most people; the principal motivation given by those who do change dietary
regime is not cost but for personal reasons, such as health [6].
Note that the elicitation protocol, at individual expert level, does not entail any consistency checks
for the scenario price changes per food category. There will, inevitably, be some jitter in joint price
change estimates when individual judgements are combined in the weighted group solutions. Thus,
differences of order +/- 1% in the findings are not meaningful. Also, the distribution support for
each food type, provided by the experts, is predominantly for some measure of price increase and,
in all cases, decreases are relatively low probability events; it should not be surprising that, for many
foods, the combined distribution is heavily positive. Thus, while individual food prices may not
change dramatically, the compound effect in a basket of foods can be substantial.
The weighted combination of the three alternative exit agreement scenarios shows projected mean
and median percentage CPI changes (+13.6% and +13.3% respectively, Table 1), very similar to those
for Scenario B, confirming the latter represents a middle-of-the-road Brexit scenario, as far as
anticipated subsequent changes in food prices are concerned. The weighted combination 90%
credible interval percentage CPI basket change spread [+6.1%, +22.4%] is narrower than individual
scenario spreads. Counterintuitively, but as proven with judgements by individual experts, combining
alternative scenario distributions jointly in this way can produce price change forecasts whose
quantiles are more informative than those of the separate, contributing individual expert
distributions. The costs in £ of the CPI basket, healthy family of four and healthy pensioner baskets
are given in Table 1.
The CPI basket reflects typical spending across all household types and income bands. Under
Scenario C, this is expected to rise by a mean of +10.0%, leading to a median weekly price increase of
+£8.44, 90% credible interval [+£1.14, +£18.54]. Under Scenario B, this rises to mean increase of
+13.6%, median +£12.58 [+£2.59, +£23.05] and, under Scenario A, to a mean increase of +18.7%,
median +£16.29[+£5.41, +£29.36].

For the healthy basket for a family of four, the median increase under Scenario C is £10.05 per week,
90% credible interval [£0.58, £23.93]. Under Scenario B the median increase is £13.74 [£2.91,
£28.34] and under Scenario A, £19.04 [£5.30, £38.16].
For the healthy basket for a single pensioner, the median increase under Scenario C is +£3.78 per
week, 90% credible interval [+£0.30, +£8.82]. Under Scenario B, the median increase is +£4.89
[+£0.93, +£10.42] and under Scenario A, £6.73 [£1.66, £13.84].
Table 1 *Based on Office for National Statistics Table A2 2018year-end data (March 2018): selected basket subfood
category weekly costs; total for the 10 items, updated using ONS data to July 2020 and projected to December 2020.
**Based on MacMahon and Weld Northern Ireland minimum essential healthy basket subfood category weekly costs at
November 2014 Tesco prices, updated using ONS data to July 2020 and projected to December 2020. For two adults and
two children, one in preschool (aged 2–4) and one in primary school (aged 6–11), total cost for the 10 items=£95.41; for a
single pensioner, the corresponding selected items cost=£35.92.

To illustrate some plausible futures beyond the median outcome, suppose that under Scenario B (as
middle-of-road) the costs of all foods in that basket were to rise each to lie in the range above its
own 84th percentile percentage price change value, the weekly CPI basket cost increases by
+£31.57, i.e. the weekly CPI basket total cost would go to £90.92. This contrasts with the expected
weekly CPI basket cost (£59.35) increase of +£12.64 (Table 1).
Under Scenario A, median CPI basket price increase is +£16.29 (Table 1). If Fruit and Vegetables only
rise to their 95th percentile values, and all other prices remain at the median, the CPI basket price
increase is Mean +£19.89 ± £6.84 Median +£19.50 90% CI [+£9.31, +£31.70]. (Note the new 90%
credible interval is marginally smaller as a result of ‘better’ uncertainty information on Fruit and
Vegetables).
Compared to the earlier estimates of food costs under the previous Brexit ‘deal’ and ‘no-deal’
scenarios [2], the updated elicitation shows that Scenario C is likely to yield higher food price rises
than under the Brexit ‘deal’ scenario, had the UK had left the EU on 29th March 2019. In contrast,
the price increase estimates for the current Scenario A are slightly lower than the previous estimates
for a Brexit ‘no-deal’, and the credible interval is narrower. This said, it is notable that in this
updating elicitation, overall food prices are not expected to fall under any scenario.

Discussion
Food is a substantial portion of household expenditure, especially in low-income households. Falling
incomes and rising prices in general, including food prices, will lead to a need for many to reduce
food purchasing in order to meet other essential living costs. The corollary is that food purchasing
would be further pushed toward lower cost, nutrient poor items, driving more households into food
insecurity.
From this updating elicitation, and on a timescale of fifteen months after the end of the Brexit
transition period, food price rises are likely to be significant and, with time, may become substantial;
moreover, such increases could start to be felt by the whole population very quickly [1]. To
compound matters, incomes are expected to stagnate or fall over the same period. A comparison of

independent forecasts for the UK economy [7] shows a net fall in median household real disposable
income of about 2.8% for the six months of 2020 that remained after the elicitation was completed.
Such estimates range from falls of 1.1% to 5.8%. Forecasts for 2021 range from a rise in disposable
income of +4.7% to a fall of -2.0%, with a median +1.1% rise. These same forecasts project rises on
consumer prices index from -0.01% to +1.8% (median +0.4%) for 2020, and from +0.5% to +3.2%
(median +2.0%) for 2021. In other words, any economic recovery is likely to be out-paced by food
price ranges over those timeframes.
After housing and childcare costs, the highest category of household expenditure in Northern Ireland
is on a minimum essential ‘healthy’ food basket [4]. Recent research estimates that the UK Global
Tariff alone, which will apply wherever a trade deal has not been agreed, will add £246.38 per year
to the food bill for a family of four. Cost increases due to exchange rate changes and ’on costs’ due
to transport delays, meeting border infrastructure costs and import processing bureaucracy are
additional [8].
The North East, West Midlands and East of England have been assessed as UK regions most likely to
suffer negative economic impacts because of Brexit, as they are disproportionately reliant on the
most exposed sectors for output and employment [9].
On the basis of our updating elicitation and revised BBN uncertainty analysis, the number of
households experiencing food insecurity and the severity of impacts are likely to increase because of
the expected sizeable increases in median food prices after Brexit, evaluated here. The effects are
likely to fall disproportionately on already impoverished regions within the UK. Higher food price
increases are much more likely than lower rises and, towards the upper reaches of our uncertainty
distributions, these would entail very severe impacts. Research showing a low food budget leads to
increasingly poor diet suggests that demand for health services in both the short and longer term is
likely to increase simply due to the effects of food insecurity on the incidence and management of
diet-sensitive conditions. The recent modelling [10, 11] anticipating a 61% rise in demand for
emergency food parcels in the last quarter of 2020 plus increase in demand for free school meals
indicated an already incipient UK food insecurity crisis.
