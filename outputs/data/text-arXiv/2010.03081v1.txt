Abstract
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has
quickly become a global public health crisis unseen in recent years. It is known that the structure of the human contact network plays an important role in the spread of transmissible diseases. In this work, we study a structure aware
model of COVID-19 (CGEM). This model becomes similar to the classical compartment-based models in epidemiology if we assume the contact network is a Erdős-Reńyi (ER)
graph, i.e. everyone comes into contact with everyone else
with the same probability. In contrast, CGEM is more expressive and allows for plugging in the actual contact networks, or
more realistic proxies for it. Moreover, CGEM enables more
precise modelling of enforcing and releasing different nonpharmaceutical intervention (NPI) strategies. Through a set
of extensive experiments, we demonstrate significant differences between the epidemic curves when assuming different
underlying structures. More specifically we demonstrate that
the compartment-based models are overestimating the spread
of the infection by a factor of 3, and under some realistic assumptions on the compliance factor, underestimating the effectiveness of some of NPIs, mischaracterizing others (e.g.
predicting a later peak), and underestimating the scale of the
second peak after reopening.

Introduction
Epidemic modelling of COVID-19 has been used to inform public health officials across the globe and the subsequent decisions have significantly affected every aspect
of our lives, from financial burdens of closing down businesses and the overall economical crisis, to long term affect
of delayed education, and adverse effects of confinement on
mental health. Given the huge and long-term impact of these
models on almost everyone in the world, it is crucial to design models that are as realistic as possible to correctly assess the cost benefits of different intervention strategies. Yet,
current models used in practice have many known issues. In
particular, the commonly-used compartment based models
from classical epidemiology do not consider the structure
of the real world contact networks. It has been shown previously that contact network structure changes the course of an
infection spread significantly (Keeling 2005; Bansal, Grenfell, and Meyers 2007). In this paper, we demonstrate the
structural effect of different underlying contact networks in
COVID-19 modelling.

Figure 1: CGEM can utilize realistic contact networks.
Standard compartment models assume an underlying ER
contact network, whereas real networks have a non-random
structure as seen in Montreal Wifi example. In each network,
two infected patients with 5 and 29 edges are selected randomly and the networks in comparison have the same number of nodes and edges. In Wifi network, infected patients
are highly likely to spread their infection in their local communities while in ER graph they have a wide-spread reach.
Non-pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) played a significant role in limiting the spread of COVID-19. Understanding effectiveness of NPIs is crucial for more informed policy making at public agencies (see the timeline of NPIs applied in Canada in Table 2). However, the commonly used
compartment based models are not expressive enough to directly study different NPIs. For example, Ogden et al. (2020)
described the predictive modelling efforts for COVID-19
within the Public Health Agency of Canada. To study the
impact of different NPIs, they used an agent-based model
in addition to a separate deterministic compartment model.
One significant disadvantage of the compartment model is
its inability to realistically model the closure of public places
such as schools and universities. This is due to the fact that
compartment models assume that each individual has the
same probability to be in contact with every other individual in the population which is rarely true in reality. Only by
incorporating real world contact networks into compartment
models, one can disconnect network hubs to realistically
simulate the effect of closure. Therefore, Ogden et al. (2020)
need to rely on a separate stochastic agent-based model to

model the closure of public places. In contrast, our proposed
CGEM is able to directly model all NPIs used in practice
realistically.
In this work, we propose to incorporate structural information of contact network between individuals and show
the effects of NPIs applied on different categories of contact
networks. In this way, we can 1) more realistically model
various NPIs, 2) avoid the imposed homogeneous mixing
assumption from compartment models and utilize different
networks for different population demographics. First, we
perform simulations on various synthetic and real world networks to compare the impact of the contact network structure on the spread of disease. Second, we demonstrate that
the degree of effectiveness of NPIs can vary drastically depending on the underlying structure of the contact network.
We focus on the effects of 4 widely adopted NPIs: 1) quarantining infected and exposed individuals, 2) social distancing,
3) closing down of non-essential work places and schools,
and 4) the use of face masks. Lastly, we simulate the effect
of re-opening strategies and show that the outcome will depend again on the assumed underlying structure of the contact networks.
To design a realistic model of the spread of the pandemic,
we also used a wifi hotspot network from Montreal to simulate real world contact networks. Given our data is from
Montreal, we focus on studying Montreal timeline but the
basic principles are valid generally and CGEM is designed
to be used with any realistic contact network. We believe
that CGEM can improve our understanding on the current
COVID-19 pandemic and be informative for public agencies
on future NPI decisions.
Summary of contributions:
• We show that structure of the contact networks significantly changes the epidemic curves and the current compartment based models are subject to overestimating the
scale of the spread
• We demonstrate the degree of effectiveness of different
NPIs depends on the assumed underlying structure of the
contact networks
• We simulate the effect of re-opening strategies and show
that the outcome will depend again on the assumed underlying structure of the contact networks

Network Structures and Disease Modelling
Different approaches have accounted for network structures in epidemiological modelling. Degree block approximation (Barabási et al. 2016) considers the degree distribution of the network by grouping nodes with the same degree
into the same block and assuming that they have the same
behavior. Percolation theory methods (Newman 2002) can
approximate the final size of the epidemic for networks with
specified degree distributions. Recently, Sambaturu et al.

Table 1: Timeline of Canada COVID-19 selected NPI events
based on (Vogel 2020; Lawson et al. 2020)
design effective vaccination strategies based on real and diverse contact networks. Various modifications are made to
the compartment differential equations to account for the
network effect (Aparicio and Pascual 2007; Keeling 2005;
Bansal, Grenfell, and Meyers 2007). Simulation-based approaches are often used when the underlying networks are
complex and mathematically intractable. Grefenstette et al.
(2013) employed an agent-based model to simulate the dynamics of the SEIR model with a census-based synthetic
population. The contact networks are implied by the behavior patterns of the agents. Chen et al. (2020) adopted the Independent Cascade (IC) model (Saito, Nakano, and Kimura
2008) to simulate the disease propagation and used Facebook network as a proxy for the contact network. Social networks, however, are not always a good approximation for the
physical contact networks. In our study, we attempt to better ground the simulations by inferring the contact networks
from wifi hub connection records.

period), prevalence of hospital admissions and ICU use, and
death. They assumed the effect of physical-distancing measures were to reduce the number of contacts per day across
the entire population. In addition, enhanced testing and contact tracing were assumed to move individuals with nonsevere symptoms from the infectious to isolated compartments. In this work, we also examine the effect of closure
of public places which is difficult to simulate in a realistic
manner for standard compartment models.
Ogden et al. (2020) described the predictive modelling
efforts for COVID-19 within the Public Health Agency of
Canada. They estimated that more than 70% of the Canadian
Population may be infected by COVID-19 if no intervention is taken. They proposed an agent-based model and a deterministic compartment model. In the compartment model,
similar to Tuite, Fisman, and Greer (2020), effects of physical distancing are modelled by reducing daily per capita contact rates. The agent model is used to separately simulate
the effects of closing schools, workplaces and other public
places. In this work, we compare the effects all NPIs used
in practice through a unified model and show how different
contact networks change the outcome of NPIs. In addition,
Ferguson et al. (2020) employed an individual-based simulation model to evaluate the impact of NPIs, such as quarantine, social distancing and school closure. The number of
deaths and ICU bed demand are used as proxies to compare
the effectiveness of NPIs. In comparison, our model can directly utilize contact networks and we also model the impact
of wearing masks. Block et al. (2020) proposed three selective social distancing strategies based on the observations
that epidemic dynamics depends on the network structure.
The strategies aim to increase network clustering and eliminate shortcuts and are shown to be more effective than naive
social distancing. Reich, Shalev, and Kalvari (2020) proposed a selective social distancing strategy which lower the
mean degree of the network by limiting super-spreaders. The
authors also compared the impact of various NPIs, including testing, contact tracing, quarantine and social distancing.

where an individual can be in one of the 4 states: (S) susceptible, (E) exposed, (I) infected and can infect nodes that
are susceptible, and (R) recovered at any given time step t.
β, σ, γ are the transition rates from S to E, E to I, and I to
R respectively.
Similarly, in CGEM, an individual can be either S susceptible, E exposed, I infected or R recovered. We do not
consider reinfection, but extensions are straightforward. Unlike the equation-based SEIR model which assumes homogeneous mixing, CGEM takes into account the contact patterns between the individuals by simulating the spread of a
disease over a contact network. Each individual becomes a
node in the network and the edges represent the connections
between people.
Algorithm 1 shows the pseudo code for CGEM1 . Given a
contact network, we assume that a node comes into contact
with all its neighbours at each time step. More specifically,
at each time step, the susceptible neighbours of infected
individuals will become infected with a transmission probability φ, and enter the exposed state (illustrated below).
We randomly select exposed nodes to become infected with
probability σ and let them recover with a probability γ.

Algorithm 1: CGEM

The regular random network with average degree k ∗
would be the contact network the classic SEIR model is approximating and φ∗ = β/k ∗ would be the implied transmission rate. We will use this transmission rate for other contact
networks studied, so that the dynamics of the disease (transmissibility) is fixed and only the structure of contact graph
changes.

Generalizing SEIR Model
CGEM provides a generalized version of SEIR model
which allows plugging in different structures. How can we
draw connections between the parameters between the original model and our graph-based model? On the infection
propagation process, the only parameter that differs from the
original model is the transmission rate, φ. Other parameters
are directly matched with the original model. On the structure side, if substituting the ER graph with other synthetic
graphs, e.g. BA model (Barabási et al. 2016), the parameters of the synthetic graph generation could be adjusted to
produce graphs with same sizes thus facilitating a fair comparison between different structures. We discuss details in
the following sections.
Inferring Transmission Rate By definition, β represents
the likelihood that a disease is transmitted from an infected
to a susceptible in a unit time. Barabási et al. (2016) assumes
that on average each node comes into contact with k neighbors, then the relationship between β and the transmission
rate φ can be expressed as:
β = hki · φ

Tuning Synthetic Network generators As a proxy for
actual contact networks which are often not available, we
can pair CGEM with synthetic networks with more realistic properties, comparable to real world networks e.g.
heavy-tail degree distribution, small average shortest path,
etc. To adjust the parameters of these generators, we can reframe the problem as: given transmission rate φ∗ and population size n, are there other networks which can produce
the same infection curve? For this, we can carry out similar procedures as above. For example, we can run CGEM
with transmission rate φ∗ over scale-free networks generated
from different values of mBA , where mBA is the number
of edges a new node can form in the Barabasi Albert algorithm (Barabási et al. 2016). mBA which produces the best
fit to the infection curve gives us a synthetic contact network
that is realistic in terms of number of edges compared to the
real contact network.

Modelling NPIs with Contact Graph SEIR
Here we explain how different NPIs can be modelled directly in CGEM as changes in the underlying structure.
Quarantine How can we model the quarantining and selfisolation of exposed and infected individuals? Exposed individuals have come into close contact with an infected person
and are considered to have high risk of contracting. In an
ideal world, most, if not all, infected individuals would be
easily identifiable and quarantined. However, in reality, over
40% (He et al. 2020) of infected cases are asymptomatic and
not all are identified immediately or at all and therefore can
go on to infect others unintentionally. To account for this
in our model, we apply quarantining by removing all edges
from a subset of exposed and infected nodes.

(1)

where hki is the average degree of the nodes.
In the case of a regular random network, all nodes have
the same degree, i.e. hki = k and equation 1 can be reduced
into:
β =k·φ
(2)
The homogeneous mixing assumption made by the standard SEIR model can be well simulated by running CGEM
over a regular random network, we propose to bridge the two
models with the following procedure:
1. Fit the classic SEIR model to real data to estimate β.
2. Run CGEM over regular random networks with different
values of k and with φ derived from equation 2.

Social Distancing Social distancing reduces opportunities
of close contacts between individuals by limiting contacts to
those from the same household and staying at least 6 feet
apart from others when out in public. In CGEM, a percentage of edges from each node are removed to simulate the
effects of social distancing to different extent.
Wearing Masks Masks are shown to be effective in reducing the transmission rate of COVID-19 with a relative risk
(RR) of 0.608 (Ollila et al. 2020). We simulate this by assigning a mask wearing state to each node and varying the
transmissibility, φ, based on whether 2 nodes in contact are
wearing masks or not. We define the new transmission rate

with this NPI, φmask as follows:

m2 · φ, if both nodes wearing masks
φmask = m1 · φ, if 1 node wearing masks

m0 · φ, otherwise
Closure: Removing Hubs Places of mass gathering (e.g.
schools and workplaces) put large number of people in close
proximity. If infected individuals are present in these locations, they can have a large number of contacts and very
quickly infect many others. In a network, these nodes with a
high number of connections, or degree, are known as hubs.
By removing the top degree hubs, we simulate the effects
of cancelling mass gathering, and closing down schools and
non-essential workplaces. In CGEM, we remove all edges
from r% of top degree nodes to simulate the closure of
schools and non-essential workplaces. However, some hubs,
such as (workers in) grocery stores and some government
agencies, must remain open, so we assign each hub a successful removal rate of psuccess to control this effect.
Compliance Given the NPIs are complied by majority but
not all the individuals, we randomly assign a fixed percentage of the nodes as non-compilers. We set this to 26% in all
the simulations based on a recent survey (Bricker 2020).

between 110,000 to 220,000 edges, with the exception of
the USC network. Due to the aggregated nature of the USC
dataset, edge sampling is enforced during the contact phase
in order to obtain reasonable disease spread. The synthetic
networks are in general more closely connected than the
Montreal wifi networks, despite having similar number of
nodes and edges. Only the largest connected component is
considered in all networks.

We compare the spread of COVID-19 with synthetic and

have the same degree, (2) the Erdős-Reńyi random network, where the degree distribution is Poisson distributed,
(3) the Barabasi Albert network, where the degree distributions follows a power law. Additionally, we analyzed 4
real world network, the USC35 network from the Facebook100 dataset (Traud, Mucha, and Porter 2012), consisting of Facebook friendship relationship links between students and staffs at the University of Southern California in
September 2005, and 3 snapshots of a real world wifi hotspot
network from Montreal (Lenczner and Hoen 2015), a network often used as a proxy for human contact network while
studying disease transmission (Hoen et al. 2015; Yang et al.
2020). In the Montreal wifi network, edges are formed between nodes (mobile phones) that are connected to the same
public wifi hub at the same time. As shown in Table 3, each
of the 7 networks consist of 17,800 nodes, consistent with
1/100th of the population of the city of Montreal, and have

Reopening Strategies
Due to the economical and psychological impacts of a complete lockdown on the society, it is critical to know how safe
it is to resume commercial and social activities once the pandemic has stabilized. Therefore, we also investigate the impact of relaxing each NPIs and the risk of a second wave
infection. More specifically, we simulate a complete reversing of the NPIs, by adding back the edges that were removed
when the NPI was applied at first, to return the underlying
structure to its original form.

Structures Changes the Epidemic Curves
The structure of the contact network plays an important role
in the spread of a disease (Bansal, Grenfell, and Meyers
2007). It dictates how likely susceptible nodes will come
into contact with infected ones and therefore it is crucial to
evaluate how the disease will spread on each network with
the same initial parameters. Here, the classic SEIR model is
fitted against the infection rates from the first of the 100th
case in Montreal to April 4 to obtain β, which is before any
NPI is applied. With Eq. 2, the transmission rate, φ, is estimated to be 0.0371 and is used across all networks. In all
experiments, we also seed the population with the same initial number of 3 exposed nodes and 1 infected node. The
parameters used to generate synthetic networks are obtained
following the procedures described in the previous session.
All results are averaged across 10 runs. The grey shaded region shows the 95% confidence interval of each curve.

predicts, which is important information in planning for the
healthcare system. Out of all tested NPIs, applying quarantine has the most profound reduction on all infections
curves.
Observation 3 Quarantining delays the peak of infection
on the ER graph whereas the peak on the real world graphs
are lowered but not delayed significantly.

network structures without any NPI interventions. (right)
spread of the pandemic during the time period fitted to the
real data. The black dotted line indicates the date up to which
the infection rate of the synthetic networks is fitted against
the real world infection data, which coincides with the start
of closed down, first NPI, in real-world.
(a) ER

As shown in Figure 2, the ER network fits the base
SEIR model almost perfectly–compare green ’ER’ and black
’base’ curves.
Observation 1 CGEM closely approximates the base SEIR
model when the contact network is assumed to be ErdősReńyi graph.
All networks drastically overestimates the spread of
COVID-19 when compared with real world data. This can
be expected to some degree as in this experiment we are projecting the curves assuming no NPI is in effect which is not
what happened in reality (see ’Real’ orange curve). However, we observe that all 3 synthetic networks, including the
ER model exceedingly overshoot, showing almost the entire
population getting infected, whereas the real-world wifi networks predict a 3x lower peak.

(b) Wifi 2

Figure 3: Results of applying quarantine to 50, 75, and 95%
of nodes on ER and wifi2 graph structures. Other wifi networks show the same pattern and are omitted for brevity but
are reported in the supplementary materials.
Social Distancing reduces the number of close contacts.
Different degrees of 10%, 30%, and 50% of edges from each
node is removed to simulate this. Figure 9 shows the effects
of social distancing on the infection curves of each network
structures. It is effective in reducing the peak of the pandemic on all networks but again delays the peaks only on
synthetic networks. Similar to Observation 3, we have:
Observation 4 Social distancing delays the peak of infection on the ER graph whereas the peak on the real world
graphs are lowered but not delayed significantly.

Observation 2 Assuming an Erdős-Reńyi graph as the contact network overestimates the impact of COVID-19 by more
than a factor of 3 when compared with more realistic structures.

Structure Changes the Effects of NPIs
In order to limit the effects of the pandemic, the federal and
provincial governments introduced a number of measures to
reduce the spread of COVID-19. We simulate the effects of 4
different non-pharmaceutical interventions, or NPIs, at different strengths to determine their effectiveness. These include, (1) quarantining exposed and infected individuals, (2)
social distancing between nodes, (3) removing hubs, and (4)
the use of face masks.

Figure 4: Results of applying social distancing by removing
10, 30, and 50% of edges to all nodes on ER and Wifi2 graph
structures. Same pattern is observed for wifi1 and wifi3 (extended results are reported in the supplementary materials).

Quarantine We apply quarantining into our model on
March 23. Where both Quebec and Canadian government
have asked those who returned from foreign travels or experienced flu-like symptoms to self isolate. We remove all
edges from 50, 75, and 95% of exposed and infected nodes
to simulate various strengths of quarantining. Figure 8 displays the effect of quarantining on different graph structures.
Quarantining infected and exposed nodes both reduces and
delays the peak of all infection curve. However, the peak
is not delayed as much in the wifi graphs as the ER graph

Removing Hubs We remove all edges from 1% of top degree nodes to simulate the closure of schools and 5 and 10%
of top degree nodes to simulate the closure of non-essential
workplaces. These NPIs are applied on March 23 respectively, coinciding with the dates of school and non-essential
business closure in Quebec. psuccess is set to 0.8 unless otherwise stated. Figure 10 shows the effects of removing hubs.
This NPI is very effective on the BA network and all 3 Montreal wifi networks since these networks have a power law

(a) ER

(b) Wifi 2

degree distribution and hubs are present. However, it is not
very effective on the regular and ER random networks.
Observation 5 The ER graph significantly underestimates
the effect of removing hubs.

(a) ER

(b) Wifi 2

Figure 5: Results of removing 1, 5, and 10% of hubs from
the ER and Wifi2 network. Again we see the same pattern
on the other two Wifi graphs.

Figure 6: Difference between cumulative curves from wearing masks and not wearing masks. The cumulative curves
represent the total impact, and the different shows how much
drop in final attack rate is estimated with the NPI enforced.

Removing hubs is most effective on networks with a
power law degree distribution since hubs act as super spreaders and removing them effectively contains the virus. However, no hubs are present in the ER and regular random
network, and thus removing hubs reduces to removing random nodes. Luckily, real world contact networks have power
law degree distributions, making a hubs removal an effective
strategy in practice.
Wearing Masks we set m2 = 0.6, m1 = 0.8 and m0 = 1,
and use the following transmission rate, φmask in CGEM:

0.6 · φ, if both nodes wearing masks
φmask = 0.8 · φ, if 1 node wearing masks

1 · φ,
otherwise
Wearing masks is only able to flatten the infection curve
on the synthetic networks but does not reduce the final epidemic attack rate, the total size of population infected, as
shown in Figure 11. However, in the real world wifi networks, wearing masks is able to both flatten the curve and
also significantly reduce the final epidemic attack rate.
Observation 6 The ER graph significantly underestimates
the effect of wearing masks in terms of the total decrease in
the final attack rate.

Structure Changes the Reopening Strategies
We experiment with reopening of all the NPIs, but for
brevity we only report the results for allowing hubs, which
corresponds to the current reopening of schools and public
places. The results form other NPIs are available in the extended results.
For removing hubs, we apply reopening on July 18 (denoted by the second vertical line in Figure 7), after many
non-essential businesses and workplaces are allowed to open
in Quebec. Because the synthetic networks estimates that
most of the population would be infected before the hubs
are reopened, we calibrate the number of infected and recovered individuals at the point of reopening to align with

Figure 7: Reopening of 10% of hubs removed earlier. The
first vertical line represents when the NPI was enforced and
the second vertical line shows when it is lifted.
statistics available in the real world data. Therefore the simulation continues after reopening with all the models having the same number of susceptible individuals, otherwise
int the ER graph, everyone is infected at that point. We can
see in Figure 7 that ER and regular random network significantly underestimates the extent of second wave infections.
BA and the wifi networks all show second wave infections
with a higher peak than the initial, prompting more caution
when considering reopening businesses and schools.
Observation 7 ER graph significantly underestimates the
second peak after reopening public places, i.e. allowing
back hubs.

Conclusions
In this paper, we propose to model COVID-19 on contact
networks (CGEM) and show that such modelling, when
compared to traditional compartment based models, gives
significantly different epidemic curves. Moreover, CGEM
subsumes the traditional models while providing more expressive power to model the NPIs. We hope that CGEM
could be used to achieve more informed policy making when
studying reopening strategies for COVID-19 .

Network generation
Montreal wifi network 3 snapshots of the Montreal wifi
network are used in this paper with the following time periods: 2004-08-27 to 2006-11-30, 2007-07-01 to 2008-0226, and 2009-12-02 to 2010-03-08. Each entry in the dataset
consists of a unique connection id, a user id, node id (wifi
hub), timestamp in, and timestamp out. Nodes in the network are the users in each connection. An edge forms between users who have connected to the same wifi hub at
the same time. Connections are sampled with the aforementioned timestamp in dates to obtain ∼ 17800 nodes. Since
there are many disconnected nodes in the wifi networks, only
the giant connected component is used.
Synthetic networks We compared CGEM with the wifi
networks with 3 synthetic network models, the regular, ER,
and BA networks. In each of these models, we set the number of nodes to be 17,800 and fit respective parameters to
best match the infection curve of the base model and the
number of edges in the wifi networks. Table 5 shows the

Computing Requirements
All the experiments have been performed on a stock laptop.

Assumptions
The following assumptions are made in CGEM:
1. Individuals who recover from COVID-19 cannot be infected again

2. Symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals have the
same transmission rate and they quarantine with the same
probability
3. A certain percentage of the population do not compile
with NPIs regardless of their connection.

Structure Changes the Effects of NPIs
Quarantine Figure 8 shows the results of quarantining
on all graph structures. Quarantining infected and exposed
nodes both reduces and delays the peak of all infection
curve. However, the peak is not delayed as much in the wifi
graphs when compared to the regular and ER graphs.
Social distancing Figure 9 shows the results of applying
social distancing on all networks. Like quarantining, this is
effective in reducing the peaks of the infection curve on all
networks, but the delay of peaks is only apparent on the synthetic networks.
Removing hubs Figure 10 shows the results of apply
school and business closure on all networks. The ER and
regular random networks significantly underestimates the
effect of removing hubs.
wearing masks Figure 11 shows the results of wearing
masks and without on each network.
All NPIs Figure 12 shows the infection curves of all the
networks with all NPIs applied. On March 23, 50% social
distancing and 50% quaranine is applied, and 10% of hubs
are removed with a success rate of 0.8. Wearing mask is applied on April 6. The wifi networks more closely resemble
the shape of the real infection curve.
