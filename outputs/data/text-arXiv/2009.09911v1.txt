Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus caused the novel coronavirus
disease-2019 (COVID-19) affecting the whole world. Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV2 are thought to originate in bats and then spread to humans through intermediate hosts. Identifying
intermediate host species is critical to understanding the evolution and transmission mechanisms of
COVID-19. However, determining which animals are intermediate hosts remains a key challenge.
Virus host-genome similarity (HGS) is an important factor that reflects the adaptability of virus to host.
SARS-CoV-2 may retain beneficial mutations to increase HGS and evade the host immune system.
This study investigated the HGSs between 399 SARS-CoV-2 strains and 10 hosts of different species,
including bat, mouse, cat, swine, snake, dog, pangolin, chicken, human and monkey. The results
showed that the HGS between SARS-CoV-2 and bat was the highest, followed by mouse and cat.

Human and monkey had the lowest HGS values. In terms of genetic similarity, mouse and monkey are
halfway between bat and human. Moreover, given that COVID-19 outbreaks tend to be associated with
live poultry and seafood markets, mouse and cat are more likely sources of infection in these places.
However, more experimental data are needed to confirm whether mouse and cat are true intermediate
hosts. These findings suggest that animals closely related to human life, especially those with high
HGS, need to be closely monitored.

Introduction
In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was announced and later named as the Severe Acute
Respiration Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 infected human through
respiration system, causing serious inflammatory reaction and damages of lung[1, 2], kidney[3],
digestive system[4] and heart[5], and cause liver damage[6]. Compared with SARS-CoV and MERSCoV, SARS-CoV-2 evolved an enhanced ability to survive and spread in environments such as food
surfaces and packaging. The infection rate of the SARS-CoV-2 is at a very high level, causing an
ongoing worldwide pandemic. By August 2020, the total number of confirmed cases globally was
about 20,426,316 and the number of deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2 was about 740,143.
It is estimated that about 60% of known infectious diseases and 75% new diseases originate in
animals[7-9]. One of the crucial ways to stop the spread of the virus is to find the intermediate hosts
of SARS-CoV-2. Bats are believed to be the origin host of several kinds of deadly coronaviruses[10,
11]. Recent studies reported that the SARS-CoV-2 found in human has nearly 96% genome similarity
with that in bats[10]. Nevertheless, how the virus jumped from bats to human is still unclear. Studies
suggested that pangolins and snakes may be potential intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2[12-15]. But

further investigation is required to make a final conclusion[16, 17].
It has been reported that live poultry markets may be the source of SARS-CoV and influenza[18].
There are hundreds of stalls selling all kinds of meat, seafood, live poultry, and sometimes wild game.
Live poultry markets are thought to play an important role in influenza epidemiology[19]. Human
influenza virus (H5N1) had clear genetic similarity with avian influenza that preceded human
infection[20]. And most human patients infected by avian influenza A (H7N9) virus were directly
exposed to infected poultry or indirect exposure in contaminated environments[21]. There is
widespread concern that live poultry markets present a risk of cross-infection between humans and
animals.
The early discovery of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019 was related to a seafood market. On 10 June,
the new outbreak of COVID-19 in Beijing was also linked to a large market, particularly stalls in the
seafood market. The SARS-CoV-2 has been found on salmon chopping boards, and even at the surface
of soybean products. Recent reports indicate that SARS-CoV-2 was also found on the packaging
surfaces of frozen seafood[22, 23]. The chances of getting infected through exposure to live poultry,
seafood and other products are real. But the link between SARS-CoV-2 and seafood markets is still a
mystery.
It is hypothesis that people working at the seafoods market may be a potential source of SARS-CoV2[22], which implies that there were unidentified human host triggered the first outbreak of COVID19. Repeated outbreaks in live poultry and seafood markets suggest a specific pattern of virus
transmission that we do not yet understand. In open seafood markets with many stalls, animals
frequently come into contact with humans and food, which makes it very likely that animals can carry

and spread the virus. It is not unreasonable to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be related to animal
pollutions in the market’s environment before the virus can spread across species on a large scale.
The coronaviruses jump from bats to human through intermediate hosts, such as palm civets and
dromedary camels. A recent study on host range showed that many different species, including mouse,
swine, chicken, domestic cat and tiger, pangolin, mink and snake, could potentially be infected by the
SARS-CoV-2[24-26]. There is high chance that occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in seafood markets might
be related to common animals, such as cats, mice or dogs. But the roles such mammals played in the
spreading process of the SARS-CoV-2 have not been fully understood.
In this study, we proposed a method to search for possible intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 based
on the determination of host-genome similarity (HGS)[27]. The exchange of genetic information
between virus and hosts can help to enhance the viral adaption, which leads to higher host and virus
genome similarity. The high genome similarity between virus and host implies that the virus may have
stronger infectivity and adaptability to the host[24, 27]. Studying viral HGS with bats, humans and a
range of intermediate hosts may shed lights on how SARS-CoV-2 crosses the species barrier in terms
of genetic similarity.
We examined the genome similarities of a set of SARS-CoV-2 strains to 10 hosts of different species,
including bat, mouse, cat, swine, snake, dog, pangolin, chicken, human and monkey. The virus genome
data set consists of 399 coding sequences of SARS-CoV-2 with geolocation from China. The results
showed that SARS-CoV-2 had a high degree of similarity to the bat genome, followed by mouse and
cat, and then other animals. Human and monkey were at the bottom of the HGS ranking. Based on
genomic similarities, mouse and cat were likely the missing link in the viral transmission chain from

bat to human. In addition to genetic similarity data, mouse and cat were also most likely to be present
at live poultry markets and exposed to seafood and other products. This raises the possibility of mouse
and cat as the source of infctions in seafood markets.
Although direct contact between the mouse/cat and affected seafood has not been formally confirmed,
the results suggest that the virus may be transmitted to humans from the original host (bat) through
intermediate hosts (mouse and cat) with high HGS. This conclusion implies that there may be an
overlooked animal transmission chain composed of animals in close contact with human daily life.
Humans may be at risk of animal-to-human or animal-to-food-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV2. This work shows the importance of enhanced animal surveillance, especially with animals such as
mouse and cat that have close contact with humans.

Results
SARS-CoV-2 has high HGSs with bat, mouse and cat
Quantitative measurement of host-genome similarity (HGS) has been used to detect SARS-CoV-2 gene
mutations[27]. Here we investigated the HGS between viral coding sequences (CDSs) of SARS-CoV2 and genomes of 10 hosts, including human (Homo sapiens GRCh38.p12 chromosomes), bat
(Rhinolophus ferrumequinum mRhiFer1_v1.p), mouse (Mus musculus GRCm38.p6), cat (Felis catus
Felis_catus_9.0), swine (Sus scrofa Sscrofa11.1), snake (Pseudonaja textilis EBS10Xv2-PRI), dog
(Canis lupus CanFam3.1), pangolin (Manis javanica ManJav1.0), chicken (Gallus gallus GRCg6a)
and monkey (Macaca mulatta Mmul_10). The NCBI Blastn was used to obtain the CDS alignment
scores [28]. The HGS between SARS-CoV-2 and hosts was calculated based on the method in a recent

work[27].
The SARS-CoV-2 has a positive-sense single-stranded RNA approximately 30 kb in length. Viral RNA
sequence contains 14 5'-ORFs (open reading frames) with length no less than 75 nt (Figure 1). These
ORFs encode a series of viral proteins: the replication proteins open reading frame ORF1a and ORF1ab,
the structural proteins S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), N (nucleocapsid) and accessory proteins
(such as ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8) with unknown homologues. The coronavirus ORFs are usually
organized in a pattern ‘-S-X-E-M-X-X-X-N-’ where ‘X’ represents accessory protein genes. The
number of accessory genes ‘X’ may vary in different viruses (such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2).

Figure 1. Genome organization of SARS-CoV-2.
By comparing with the host gene sequence, each ORF segment of SARS-CoV-2 has a host-genome
similarity. A genome-wide HGS can be obtained by the weighted sum of ORF HGSs. The weight
coefficient is the fraction of the ORF length in the entire genome. The HGS values was calculated for
399 SARS-CoV-2 genomes with geolocation from China. Figure 2-4 show the HGS between S (spike)
gene, ORF6 and ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2 and the genomes of 10 hosts.

Figure 2. HGS between S (spike) gene and host genomes for 399 SARS-CoV-2 genomes with
geolocation from China.

Figure 3. HGS between ORF6 gene and host genomes for 399 SARS-CoV-2 genomes with geolocation
from China.

Figure 4. HGS between ORF8 gene and host genomes for 399 SARS-CoV-2 genomes with geolocation
from China.
Amazingly, the host-genome similarity of SARS-CoV-2 genes were quite different for different hosts.
For the S (spike) gene of SARS-CoV-2, the largest HGS occured between virus and bat (Figure 2).
While for ORF6 and ORF8, SARS-CoV-2 had largest HGSs for mouse and cat respectively (Figure 3,
Figure 4). The HGS values of the 399 viral genomes were quite consistent for each kind of host. At the
same time, the S (spike) gene had much more data fluctuations than that of ORF6 and ORF8. Such
data dispersion clearly demonstrated that the S gene contains more genetic variations.
For different viral genes, the ranking of genome similarity to the host was also changing. Since RNA
viruses are susceptible to gene mutations, SARS-CoV-2 may evolve improved host adaptability by
mutating different ORF sequences. By acquiring immune modulation genes from cells, viral proteins
can regulate or inhibit the host's immune system[29, 30]. Under the selection pressure exerted by the
host immune system, SARS-CoV-2 may possess the ability to mutate specific genes against different
hosts and escape the hosts’ innate immune system.

Different genes encode different viral proteins that play various roles during invading host cells.
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the surface of host
cell and translocate into cell through endocytosis process[31]. ORF6 protein of SARS-CoV enhances
suppression of IFNβ expression in host innate immunity[32]. As a membrane protein with 63 amino
acids, ORF6 also blocks the IFNAR-STAT signaling pathway by limiting the mobility of the importin
subunit KPNB1 and preventing the STAT1 complex from moving into the nucleus for ISRE
activation[33]. In addition, ORF6 circumvents IFN production by inhibiting IRF-3 phosphorylation in
the (TRAF3)-(TBK1+IKKε)-(IRF3)-(IFNβ) signaling pathway, which is an essential signaling
pathway triggered by the viral sensors RIG-1/MDA5 and TLRs[34]. ORF8 encodes a single accessory
protein at the early stage of SARS-CoV infection and splits into two fragments, ORF8a and ORF8b,
at later stages[35]. Proteins ORF8b and ORF8ab in SARS-CoV inhibited the IFN response during viral
infection[36]. The antagonism between the virus and host’s immune system may have different
biological mechanisms in different hosts. From the perspective of ORF genetic similarity, the change
of host rank may be a reflection of the different viral adaptabilities to different hosts.
In addition to the similarity between viral ORF and host genome, genome-wide HGS is an effective
factor of viral transmission/pathology capability. The full-length genome data were from the Global
Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database[37]. The sequence requirements were fulllength sequences only, sequences with definite collection dates and locations, and no nucleotide names
other than A, G, C and T. The number of genomes that met such requirements was 399 for China by
the time of 21 June, 2020.

Figure 5. Rank of 10 hosts based on the mean genome-wide HGS of 399 SARS-CoV-2 genomes with
geolocation from China. Bats had the highest HGS, while human and monkey had the lowest. In order
of HGS values, the intermediate hosts between bat and human are mouse, cat, swine, snake, dog,
pangolin and chicken.
Figure 5 shows that SARS-CoV-2 had the highest mean genome-wide HGS with bat, followed by
mouse, cat, swine, snake, dog, pangolin, chicken, human and monkey. The mean genome-wide HGS
was the average of genome-wide HGS for all 399 SARS-CoV-2 strains (Table 1). Bat, mouse and cat
were the top 3 hosts with the highest HGSs (0.09179, 0.09089 and 0.09084 respectively). Human and
monkey are hosts that had the lowest HGS (0.07007 and 0.06956 respectively). The mean genomewide HGS values of swine, snake, dog, pangolin and chicken were significantly lower than those of
mice and cats (Figure 5). The roles of mouse and cat in SARS-CoV-2 transmission have not been
confirmed. However, by identifying the genome similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with a set of hosts, the
mouse and cat had more chances to be potential candidates carrying virus and polluting products in

live poultry market inferred from the rank of HGS values.

HGS is a measure of genome similarity between virus and host, which may reflect the adaptability to
host’s immune system. The identification of intermediate hosts based on mean genome-wide HGS
demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 can become well adapted to different hosts. It is reasonable to
hypothesize that animals with high SARS-CoV-2 HGS may be origin or intermediate hosts. The results
show that bat had the highest HGS. It has been confirmed that bats were the source of many fatal virus
of infectious diseases, including Ebola, rabies, Nipah and Hendra. Mouse and cat also have very high
HGS. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, house mice carry at least 7 deadly
diseases, such as Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome, Leptospirosis, Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis,
Plague, Rat-Bite Fever, Tularemia and Salmonellosis. Infected mouse and cat can spread diseases at
places from restaurants, grocery stores and live poultry market. The findings suggest that HGS is a
way to look for intermediate hosts from a genetic similarity perspective. However, the relationship
between HGS and cross-species transmission needs to be carefully interpreted until experimental data
are available.

Methods and materials
Viral genome data
By using BLAST ORFfinder[38], 14 ORFs were detected in the RNA genome sequence (29903 nt) of
SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank: MN908947.3). The lengths of these ORFs were no less than 75 nt and nested

ORFs were ignored. The 399 SARS-CoV-2 genomes (by June 21, 2020) with geolocation as China
were from the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/) [37]. Here complete and high-coverage
genomes were selected to for accurate HGS determinations. The viral genomes only contain nucleotide
A, G, C and T. The MATLAB (https://www.mathworks.com/help/bioinfo/ref/seqshoworfs.html) was
used to find SARS-CoV-2 CDSs. The accession IDs of the genomes and ORF HGS values can be
found in the Supplemental Information.
Host-genome similarity (HGS)
The SARS-CoV-2 CDSs were aligned with the genomes of ten hosts (Homo sapiens GRCh38.p12,
Rhinolophus ferrumequinum mRhiFer1_v1.p, Mus musculus GRCm38.p6, Felis catus Felis_catus_9.0,
Sus scrofa Sscrofa11.1, Pseudonaja textilis EBS10Xv2-PRI, Canis lupus CanFam3.1, Manis javanica
ManJav1.0, Gallus gallus GRCg6a, Macaca mulatta Mmul_10) by Blastn[28]. The HGS is defined as
H =

 a =  S' ,
n

(1)

2n

where n represents the length of the target sequence, a = S ' / 2 and S ' =

λ S − ln K
ln 2

. S is the

original score given by Blastn sequence alignment. Parameters K and λ represent the statistical
significance of the alignment[39]. Since viral ORFs have quite different lengths, the alignment results
between ORF and host genome must be rescaled for comparison. The HGS value H is a
measurement of matched base pairs when the genome are rescaled into sequences of the same length.

Data availability
The SARS-CoV-2 genomes were obtained at GISAID website (https://www.gisaid.org/). The
accession ID and HGS of 399 SARS-CoV-2 genomes are in Supplemental Information. The code for

HGS calculation is available in GitHub (https://github.com/WeitaoNSun/HGS).
