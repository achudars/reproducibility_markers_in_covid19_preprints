Abstract
Current efforts of modelling COVID-19 are often based on the standard
compartmental models such as SEIR and their variations. As pre-symptomatic
and asymptomatic cases can spread the disease between populations through
travel, it is important to incorporate mobility between populations into the
epidemiological modelling. In this work, we propose to modify the commonly-used
SEIR model to account for the dynamic flight network, by estimating the
imported cases based on the air traffic volume as well as the test positive rate at
the source. This modification, called Flight-SEIR, can potentially enable 1). early
detection of outbreaks due to imported pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic
cases, 2). more accurate estimation of the reproduction number and 3).
evaluation of the impact of travel restrictions and the implications of lifting these
measures. The proposed Flight-SEIR is essential in navigating through this
pandemic and the next ones, given how interconnected our world has become.

1 Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic spread rapidly around the
world and has affected countless lives. As of July 4, there have been 10,922,324 confirmed cases and 523,011 deaths globally [1]. Of all places, but the origin, the start
of the spread is related to travel. For example, in Canada, the first travel-related
case was identified in January 2020 and by April 2020, community transmission
was present in almost all provinces [2]. To better understand and effectively model
a global pandemic such as COVID-19, it is important to consider the following questions: 1). how to model the spread of a disease from one community to another, 2).
how to estimate the likelihood of an outbreak caused by imported cases and 3) how
to measure the effectiveness of travel bans and evaluate the impact of lifting those
restrictions. In this work, we aim to answer the above questions by incorporating
dynamic flight network into epidemiological modelling.
Most models view each population as a closed system, isolated from the rest of the
world. However, this assumption is rarely true in practice. For example, in Canada,
even with the travel restrictions in place, there are still a considerable amount of
flights going in and out of the country. As shown in Figure 1, while there was a
significant amount of reduction in daily flights to and from Canada, much air traffic

remained well after the travel restrictions were put in place, i.e. March 16th with
countries excluding US and March 20th with US. Here, each node represents one
of the airports in North America. Both the size of the node and the thickness of
the edge are in proportion to the volume of flights. Note that we focus on flights
data arriving at or departed from Canada, which is the population under study for
this work. The node size of US airports only reflect their traffic volumes related to
Canada.
To account for mobility between populations, we propose Flight-SEIR, a modification of the standard SEIR model to include the mobility of exposed individuals
between the target population and the rest of the world. We show how Flight-SEIR
is able to raise alarms of upcoming outbreaks even when there is no community
transmission. We believe that Flight-SEIR is crucial for alerting public agencies

Xiaoye Ding et al.

ahead of an outbreak similar to COVID-19. Moreover, we show that Flight-SEIR
is able to fit the real data more closely and provide a better estimation of how
contagious the disease is when compared to the standard SEIR model which either underestimates or overestimates the size of infectious population by assuming
a closed population. In the context of COVID-19, there is an immense political
and economical pressure for the governments to reopen the borders and resume
flights. Flight-SEIR can inform policy makers by predicting the epidemic curves
with projected flight data therefore performing risk estimation of lifting air travel
restrictions.

2 Related Works
Many recent works model COVID-19 with variants of the classical susceptible,
infected and recovered (SIR) and the susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered (SEIR) model [3, 2, 4, 5]. The focus of these studies is often placed on the
estimation of the basic reproduction number R0 [3], the average number of new
infections an infected individual causes in a fully susceptible population [6].
One key challenge of modelling COVID-19 is the existence of asymptomatic and
pre-symptomatic transmission [7, 8]. These pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic
carriers of COVID-19 can travel to a foreign country and initiate the spread of
COVID-19 which eventually leads to an outbreak. Motivated by this, some studies
consider the travel between populations. For example, Bogoch et al. [9] estimated
the risk of an outbreak by presenting the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index
(IDVI) for international destinations receiving the highest number of passengers
from major cities in China. Kraemer et al.[10] and Linka et al. [5] studied the
correlation between human mobility and the spread of the disease. These models
are, however, not epidemiological models and cannot project the spread of disease
based on travel patterns.
Lin et al. [11] introduced a step-wise emigration rate to model the before and after
of Wuhan lock down. Yang et al. [12] considered a dynamic population with inflow
and outflow of susceptible and exposed individuals between different provinces in
China. The size of inflow and outflow depends on the migration index, defined
based on the number of inbound and outbound events by rail, air and road traffic.
Yamana et al. [13] assessed the impact of reopening states in the US by considering the daily work movements and random movements between counties. However,
these models only consider disease spread within the same country. In comparison,
our method also incorporates international flights to effectively understand how
COVID-19 spreads globally.
Some models do account for the global spread of COVID-19. Kucharski et al. [14]
studied domestic cases within Wuhan and international cases that originated from
Wuhan. In particular, they modelled how individuals that are exposed to COVID19 in Wuhan can spread the disease to other countries. They assumed that the
probability of cases being exported from Wuhan depended on the number of cases
in Wuhan, the number of outbound travellers, the relative connectivity of different countries and the relative probability of reporting a case in each country. Wu
et al. [15] inferred R0 and the outbreak size by estimating the number of cases
exported from Wuhan. They also forecasted the spread of the disease within and

Xiaoye Ding et al.

outside Wuhan by accounting for mobility and transmissibility reduction. Chinazzi
et al.[16] applied the Global Epidemic and Mobility Model to simulate the effect
of travel ban in China. International mobility is set to reduce by 40% and 90%
after the travel ban while domestic mobility is derived from mobility indices. These
models either assume that the global travel behavior remains the same throughout
the pandemic or used a step-wise function to model mobility patterns before and after international travel restrictions. In contrast, Flight-SEIR incorporates dynamic
flight network which models more granular changes in the air traffic and provides
the flexibility of plugging in projected flight network to simulate different levels
of travel restrictions. In addition, we are not aware of any work that studies how
resuming flights will affect the spread of COVID-19, which Flight-SEIR provides.
While travel-related Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) played a significant
role in confining COVID-19, some studies focused on other NPIs such as social
distancing and quarantine [4, 17, 18, 19, 20]. For instance, Ogden et al. [17] described
the predictive modelling efforts for COVID-19 within the Public Health Agency of
Canada. They modelled the effects of physical distancing by reducing daily per
capita contact rates. A separate agent model is used to simulate the effects of
closing schools, workplaces and other public places. [18] employed an individualbased simulation model to evaluate the impact of NPIs, such as quarantine, social
distancing and school closure. [20] compared the impact of testing, contact tracing,
quarantine and social distancing with a network-based epidemic model.
Another key challenge in modelling COVID-19 is to account for various biases
such as limitations in testing capacity and individually varied lag time between
infection and final clinical outcome. Verity et al. [21] provided an estimate for the
severity of COVID-19 which corrected for censoring and ascertainment biases. They
argued that the crude case fatality ratio obtained by dividing the number of death
by the number of cases is misleading. In particular, during the beginning phase of an
epidemic, the diagnostic capacity is low and surveillance is typically biased towards
detecting clinically severe cases. Abdollahi et al. [22] made a similar argument while
focusing on COVID-19 spread in Canada and US. Limited ability to test or recognize mildly or moderately symptomatic people in US and Canada has likely led
to substantial underestimation of the infection rate. Flight-SEIR provides a way to
mitigate the various biases presented in the early stage of a pandemic by leveraging
the international flight network and estimating how many exposed individuals are
imported through flights. This risk estimation technique can be applied even when
the testing capacity of a region is limited or biased towards clinically severe cases.

3 Flight-SEIR
We modified the differential equations of a standard SEIR model to include demographics dynamics derived from the flight network. This modified SEIR model is
called Flight-SEIR. More specifically, we consider an open population setting where
exposed individuals (the E compartment) are free to travel in and out of the population as it is difficult to determine if they have been infected or not. For simplicity,
we assume that individuals who are in the infected compartment, I, would be denied boarding flights and therefore cannot travel between populations. Figure 2
illustrates the epidemic and demographic dynamics modelled by Flight-SEIR, and

Eij = P assengersij × Pi × η

(5)

Eji = P assengersji × Pj × η

(6)

where Pi denotes the test positive rate of country i, measured in the number of
confirmed cases per thousand tests. η denotes the percentage of exposed individuals
over all infected individuals. P assengersij and P assengersji estimate the total
number of passenger between population i and j and are estimated as:
P assengersij = Fij × CAP × LF

(7)

P assengersji = Fji × CAP × LF

(8)

Here, Fij and Fji are the number of outbound/inbound flights from/to country
i to/from country j. CAP gives an estimate for the average flight capacity. LF
proxies the passenger load factor (onboard passengers to available seats ratio) and
offers the flexibility of modelling the reduction in passengers per flight due to the
pandemic [25, 26].
Why do we estimate the number of exposed individuals going in/out of country i,
Eji /Eij based on the test positive rate P instead of the testing rate? Each country
has different testing capacities and strategies. The number of confirmed cases alone
does not necessarily reflect the actual number of infected individuals in each country [27]. Test positive rate P , on the other hand, gives us a rough idea how many
infected individuals we would find if we were to test everyone on the plane. The
product of P assengers and test positive rate P only tells us how many infectious

.

individuals would have come in or out of the population, assuming they have not
been prevented from travelling. To derive the number of exposed individuals, we
further multiply this with η, the percentage of exposed individuals over all infected
individuals which include the exposed and the infectious. The same η is used across
populations.

4 Estimating mobility between populations from real time data
While Flight-SEIR can be used for modelling the spread of disease over multiple
populations, in this paper we focus on one target population, Canada, to provide
more straightforward comparison with the standard SEIR model, as well as to make
collecting and estimating relevant data more manageable.
We began our study few months after the pandemic started. Unlike accessing
the real-time flight network, collecting historic flights and estimating population
movements is a challenging task. In this work, we made a few assumptions and
we tried our best to validate our estimations against external sources. We believe
that Flight-SEIR can be highly informative for decision making at public agencies
which have access to more detailed and accurate flights data. We haven’t been
able to secure access to such data. Therefore, our experiments represent our best
attempt at modelling COVID-19 and serve as a proof of concept for the potentials
of incorporating the flight network.
To estimate Fij and Fji , we collected historic flights data dating back to Jan,
2020 [31]. To correct for possible missing flights, we scaled the data so that our
account of monthly flights matches the domestic and international itinerant movements reported by Statistics Canada [32]. Based on the flights data, we constructed
one snapshot of flight network per day. The nodes are the airports and the edges represent flight connections. They are directed and weighted by the number of flights
on that day. As an example, Figure 1a and Figure 1b shows the comparison between

Xiaoye Ding et al.

Page 8 of 22

(a) Test positive rates per country

(b) Test positive rates per Canadian province

Figure 4: Test positive rates, interpolated based on data from [29, 30]

the flight network on January 20, 2020 and April 2, 2020. The size of the bubble is
proportional to the air traffic at the airport. The width of the edge is in proportion
to the number of flights between two airports. We observe that there are far fewer
flights on April 2 compared to January 20. This can be partially attributed to the
travel ban put in place in March [33]. It can also be sentiment-related i.e. people are
afraid to travel due to the pandemic. To some extent, this dynamic flight network
reflects the impact of travel restrictions.
We then further map the airports to countries or provinces and aggregate the
number of flights which serve as the input to Flight-SEIR. US passengers, flights
and load factor data [28] is used as a proxy to the flight capacity and the load factor
since this information is not available for Canada. We compute the average flight

capacity as:

F lights × LoadF actor

(9)

CAP is estimated to be 111 for international flights and 180 for domestic flights.
Figure 3 shows the interpolated load factor LF . We can see that both domestic and
international load factor have dropped significantly since the start of the year. At
the time of writing, This data is only available from January to May. We assume
that the load factor remains the same from May onward.
We obtain country-level test positive rates from public dataset [29] published by
Oxford Martin School. For provinces and territories within Canada, we use data
published by the Government of Canada [30]. Figure 4 shows the interpolated test
positive rates for selected countries and provinces. η is set to 10% to roughly agree
with the tracked travel-related (imported) cases reported by [34]. Figure 5 shows the
estimated movements of exposed people to and from Canada. We observe a spike of
incoming exposed individuals in February. The estimation drops after the various
travel-related NPIs were put in place. The number of outgoing exposed individuals
are low because Canada has a comparatively low test positive rate when compared
to the rest of the world. Figure 6 shows our estimation of total incoming exposed
individuals to Canada by January 20 and April 2.
Estimating unrestricted flight volume: We assume the January’s data to be representative of the air traffic prior to COVID-19. Therefore, we scaled the air traffic in
the following months to match January’s volume to simulate demographic dynamics
without travel restrictions in the early pandemic detection simulations. Moreover,
we used the same scaling procedure to simulate the air traffic when we lift travel
restrictions and used a scaling factor τ to control the amount of flights we resume,

in the corresponding simulations discussed below. Given that travel restrictions affect both the number of flights and the number of passengers the plane, we also
scale the load factor to account for changes in passengers per flight caused by the
relaxation of travel restrictions. The same scaling factor τ is used to scale both air
traffic volume and load factor.

5 Simulations and Discussions
In the following sections, we describe how Flight-SEIR can be applied to 1) predict
uncontrolled early time epidemic dynamics, 2) assess the impact of travel restrictions, 3) estimate the basic reproduction number R0 and 4) simulate the effect of
lifting travel restrictions. For all our experiments, we adopted mean latent period C
to be 5 and mean infectious period D to be 14 [23] suggested by WHO. The transmission rate β is obtained by fitting Flight-SEIR to country-specific COVID-19
dataset published by the government of Canada [30, 24].

Figure 7: Early time prediction without enforced travel restriction

5.1 Predict uncontrolled early time epidemic dynamics
In the early stage of an outbreak, the majority of confirmed cases are imported
from outside populations. By monitoring flights from countries with confirmed cases,
Flight-SEIR can estimate the risk of an outbreak caused by the inflow of presymptomatic cases and provide timely signals to the need for travel restrictions and
contact tracing. In particular, Flight-SEIR can provide an alert when the size of
an outbreak exceeds a given threshold. In our simulations, we consider an outbreak
occurs when the percentage of infected cases in the total population exceeds 0.05%.
This is in accordance with the World Health Organization’s definition of a disease
outbreak (the occurrence of disease cases in excess of normal expectancy) [35].
To predict early time dynamics without travel restrictions, we run Flight-SEIR
on flights network generated with a scaling factor of τ = 1, simulating the air
traffic prior to the pandemic. R0 used for this experiment can be chosen based on
existing research on the pathogen and can be adjusted as more information becomes
available. In this paper, we consider a range of [0.3, 1.2] for R0. Many works [21, 22]
reasoned that early estimation of R0 is not accurate due to reasons such as lack of
testing capabilities. Therefore, we experiment with a wider range of parameters to
include both the best and worst case scenarios. The simulation runs from January
2nd, when there is no confirmed cases, to June 1st, when the travel restrictions have
taken full effects.
Observation 1: When imported cases from outside the population are incorporated into the model, even R0 < 1 can lead to an outbreak.
Figure 8 shows the early time prediction for Canada, assuming no travel restriction
is imposed. As shown in the figure, more than 0.053% of the population will be
infected by June 1st if R0 ≥ 0.5. More than 0.104% of the population will contract
the disease if R0 ≥ 0.8. Moreover, the number of cases is still growing by the time the
simulation ends. This is in contrast with the belief in traditional epidemiology that

Xiaoye Ding et al.

Page 12 of 22

Figure 8: Early time prediction with enforced travel restriction

the disease will die out when R0 < 1 [6]. This seemingly contradicting result can
be explained by the different assumptions made by these two models. The standard
SEIR model assumes that the population is a closed system where individuals do
not move between the populations. However, this is often unrealistic considering
the huge amount of domestic and international flights annually. On the other hand,
Flight-SEIR considers demographic dynamics between populations. As a result,
even if each infectious individual infects less than one susceptible person, the disease
can still persist because exposed individuals from other populations can move into
the population of interest and transition to the infectious compartment.
5.2 Assess the impact of travel restrictions
To estimate the real impact of travel restrictions, we run Flight-SEIR with real
flights data and the same set of R0. By comparing the results for this experiment
with those in Section 5.1, we can investigate the effect of reducing air traffic on the
spread of the disease. Table 2 further quantifies the effect in terms of the different
in the infected individuals in both senarios.
Observation 2: Travel-related NPIs have a significant impact on the spread of
the disease.
Figure 8 projects the spread of disease in Canada with travel restriction and table 2 shows the results in percentage. We can see that imposing travel restrictions
can reduce the percentage of infectious individuals by up to 0.177% of the total
population. Moreover, the impact of travel restriction increases with R0. With R0
= 0.5, the infected population remains stable at 0.053% without travel restriction
whereas the curve peaks in late February and drops to 0.007% with travel restriction. With R0 = 1.2, the infected population is estimated to reach 0.342% if the
government had not issued the travel restrictions. In the meantime, only 0.165% of
population will be infected if the measure is in place.

5.3 Estimate the basic reproduction number
Flight-SEIR offers a way to decouple external source of infection with community
transmission and provides a more accurate estimation of R0i (the average number of
infections caused by infectious individuals of the same population, Ii ). For brevity,
we will drop the subscript i and use R0 instead. Flight-SEIR can also infer the initial
size of infected population from the dynamic flight network whereas the standard
SEIR model requires at least one exposed or infected individual to be present in
the population at t = 0.
To estimate R0, we run Flight-SEIR with real air traffic and search through a
set of R0. We select the one with the least mean squared error (MSE) compared
to the confirmed cases. When estimating R0, one challenge is that the data we are
fitting to does not necessarily reflect the reality due to insufficient testing [21, 22].
Flight-SEIR almost always predicts more than what was reported but it does not
mean that Flight-SEIR overestimates the number of infected people. To account for
this, we compute MSE only for time steps where test rate exceed certain threshold.
To provide a point for comparison, we also run the standard SEIR model and fit
R0 with the same loss function.
Figure 9 shows the estimation of R0 given by Flight-SEIR and the standard SEIR
model for Canada. To illustrate what happens if we start SEIR before there are any
confirmed cases, we run Early Start SEIR (the dashed purple line) for which we set
E0 and I0 both to 0. We see that its prediction remains a flat line throughout the
experiment. We start another SEIR model (the solid purple line) the date on which
total confirmed cases in Canada exceed 100 people. We search through R0 range of
[2.50, 3.45] and find the best fit to be 2.95. We observe that, at the beginning, the
standard SEIR model underestimates the number of infectious individuals compared
to the confirmed cases. However, its prediction grows exponentially and shows signs
of overestimation by the end of May. For Flight-SEIR, the R0 range is set to be
between 0.30 and 1.25 and the best fit is estimated to be 1.05. Flight-SEIR is
predicting more infectious individuals than the confirmed cases up until late April
but its curve fits almost perfectly afterwards.
Observation 3: R0 predicted by the standard SEIR model is significantly higher
than the one estimated by Flight-SEIR.
The best fit R0 for the standard SEIR model is 2.95 whereas the best fit for
Flight-SEIR is 1.05. One explanation is that the standard SEIR model assumes

Figure 9: R0 Estimation for Canada. Initially, Flight-SEIR predicts more
than the confirmed cases while the standard SEIR model underestimates the
number of infectious individuals. Later on, Flight-SEIR fits almost perfectly to
the confirmed cases whereas the standard SEIR model starts to overestimate.

that the population is closed and all infections come from within. As a result, it
requires a high R0 to sustain a fast initial growth. On the other hand, FlightSEIR acknowledges that there can be exposed individuals coming from outside the
population and therefore requires a lower rate for community transmission.
Observation 4: Flight-SEIR predicts more infected individuals than the data at
the beginning of the outbreak and the difference between the two approximates the
degree of under reporting.
Flight-SEIR predicts that there were 21620 infected individuals in Canada by
the time WHO declared COVID-19 as pandemic on March 11. In the meantime,
Canadian government only reported 100 confirmed cases [30], an under-reporting
of 21520%. By the time all provinces or territories in Canada declared a state
of emergency or a public health emergency on March 22, Flight-SEIR estimates
24465 people to have been infected while only 1438 cases were confirmed, an underreporting of 1601%. The discrepancy between our model prediction and official
report can be attributed to insufficient testing. From March 22 to June 1st, the test
rate in Canada went up by 1612% from 2.618 (tests per thousand) to 44.812(tests
per thousand) [29] while the percentage of infected population went up by 2309%
from 1438 to 34640 people. On June 1st, Flight-SEIR’s prediction and the data only
differ by 6%.
Figure 10 shows the fitting for different provinces and territories within Canada.
In almost all cases, Flight-SEIR demonstrates a better fit than the standard SEIR
model. Note that we limit the date range to be between January 2nd and June 1st
because Flight-SEIR is only designed to account for travel-specific measures and
does not consider later changes in R0 due other NPIs such as social distancing.

Quebec is estimated to have a much higher R0 than Ontario. In both cases,
Flight-SEIR shows a better fit than the standard SEIR model.

5.4 Evaluate the risks of lifting travel restrictions
Next, we study the impact of lifting travel-related NPIs such as resuming flights and
opening borders. We assume the reopen date to be August 1st and run Flight-SEIR
with air traffic generated from various the scaling factor τ to simulate reopening at
different scales. More specifically, we model the scenarios in which we resume 25%,
50%, 75% and 100% of air traffic. We obtain R0 by fitting Flight-SEIR to confirmed
cases from June 1st to August 1st, approximately 2 months before the reopen date.
We assume that it remains the same for the duration of the simulation. Figure 11
shows the fitting for Canada. We did grid search in the range of [0.50, 0.80] and

to confirmed cases from June 1st to August 1st, approximately 2 months before
the reopen date. We run grid search in the range of [0.50, 0.80] and find the
best fit to be 0.63.

found the best fit to be 0.63. We can tell from the curve that the number of cases
already started to drop and the disease appears to have been contained.
Figure 12 and Table 4 show the projections for resuming flights to and from
countries all over the world. In addition, we run Flight-SEIR with real air traffic
and plot its prediction as well as the confirmed cases as a baseline. Running FlightSEIR with real air traffic and 25% air traffic produce similar curves, indicating
that the real volume in August is only 1/4 of what it was before. When we resume
flights for 50% or more, we immediately see a rebound in the number of infectious
people. The model shows that if we resume 100% air traffic, we would have 469925
cumulative cases by September 1st compared to only 271117 infections if we remain
at 25%.
Observation 5: Both the number of imported cases and community transmission
increase with the scale of reopening.
Figure 13 and Table 3 show the daily active cases break down by source of infection. The number of imported cases increase with the scale of reopening. FlightSEIR predicts that by September 1st, there will be 43 imported cases per day if we
only resume 25% air traffic compared to 780 per day if we resume 100% air traffic.
Flight-SEIR expects there to be 6475 community transmission per day if we only
resume 25% air traffic as opposed to 18507 per day if we resume 100% air traffic. For
the same scaling factor τ , the ratio of imported cases to community transmissions
will decrease if we lift travel restrictions for a long period of time. From August
1st to September 1st, if we resume 100% air traffic, the daily imported case will
decrease from 865 to 780 whereas the daily infection caused by community transmission will increase from 10086 to 18507. The ratio of imported cases to community

The figure shows the effect of resuming 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% air traffic

and continues for a month. We observe an immediate rebound when flights
are increased by more than 50%.

transmission decreases from 0.086 to 0.042. This may be because with the imported
cases, we have a larger infected population base to infect other people and thus
more community transmissions.
Observation 6: The effect of reopening depends on countries and we need to
evaluate the risk of lifting travel restrictions on a case-by-case basis.
Figure 14 and Table 4 show the results for reopening with the United States versus
United Kingdom. We estimate that the cumulative cases will differ by 52387 people

the cumulative cases will differ by 1239 for UK. The impact of resuming flights with
UK is negligible compared to that of US. This can be explained by the fact that
half of Canada’s international flights are coming from the US and that UK has far
lower positive rate than the US.

compared to that of US.

Figure 15 shows the estimated risks of reopening for Ontario and Quebec. While
both experiments simulate the scenario in which we resume flights to and from all
countries, the impact is different for Ontario and Quebec. Ontario is estimated to
have far worse rebound than Quebec. This may be due to the fact that Ontario
have more international flights than Quebec in the dataset we collected. Another
reason may be that Flight-SEIR consider the network flow of exposed individuals
i.e. the difference between incoming and outgoing exposed. As Quebec has higher
positive rate than Ontario as shown in Figure 4, it is estimated to have much more
exposed individuals leaving the province when we resume flights. Therefore, even if

Xiaoye Ding et al.

both provinces receive the same amount of incoming exposed people, Ontario would
be at greater risks.

The figure shows the effect of resuming 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% air traffic

restriction is expected to have a mild impact on Quebec, we observe an
immediate rebound upon reopening Ontario.

6 Conclusion
In this work, we propose a modification to the widely used SEIR model, to derive
inflow and outflow of exposed individuals from flight information. Our proposed
Flight-SEIR is better suited for modelling the spread of the disease in a global
pandemic such as COVID-19. The main contributions of Flight-SEIR are threefolds:

Xiaoye Ding et al.

Page 21 of 22

• Enables early detection of outbreaks by taking into consideration the demographic dynamics of the population.
• Provides a more accurate estimation of the parameters, in particular the reproduction number R0, and therefore facilitates a better understanding of the
disease.
• Simulates the impact of travel restriction and evaluates the implications of
lifting these measures.
Even though the flight network is well recorded, access to it is still restricted. We
are working towards securing access to more accurate travel records to tune our
estimations. We would also like to use Flight-SEIR for modelling the spread of
disease in multiple populations simultaneously. In the multi-population setting, each
country or node in the flight network will have its own SEIR model and the interpopulation dynamics are proxied by the flight connections. We believe that this
should be the modelling used when facing a global pandemic.
