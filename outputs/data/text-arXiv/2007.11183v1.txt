Abstract:
Objectives:
To reduce the biases of traditional survey-based methods, this paper proposes an epidemic model-based
approach to inference the incubation period distribution of COVID-19 utilizing the publicly reported
confirmed case number.
Methods:
We construct an epidemic model, namely SEAIR, and take advantage of the dynamic transmission process
depicted by SEAIR to estimate the onset probability in each day of exposed individuals in eight impacted
countries. Based on these estimations, the general incubation probability distribution of COVID-19 has
been revealed.
Results:
The expectation, median, and 95th percentile retrieved from our major result are 6.34(95% credible interval
(CI)：6.27-6.42), 4.76(95% CI：4.68-4.84), and 14.12(95% CI：14.04-14.20). We also estimate the
incubation period distribution of COVID-19 under different government's containment efforts. The results
show that the weaker the control of the government, the closer our predictions are to the results of existing
researches.
Conclusion:
The proposed method can avoid several biases of traditional survey-based methods. However, due to the
mathematical-model-based nature of this method, the inference results are somewhat sensitive to the setting
of parameters. Therefore, this method should be practiced reasonably on the basis of a certain understanding
of the studied epidemic.

1. Introduction
The current outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has developed into a global pandemic
and leads to a global crisis. So far, however, the knowledge of COVID-19 is limited, especially its
incubation period distribution. The incubation period of an infectious disease refers to the time interval
between infection and onset of symptoms. Understanding the incubation period is not only helpful for
disease control and surveillance, but also essential to the study of mechanisms of disease transmission. For
instance, the optimal quarantine period can be determined according to the distribution of incubation period.
Although the incubation period is of great importance, it is not easy to obtain the accurate distribution of
incubation period under data limitation.
The existing literature regarding the estimation of incubation period of COVID-19 mainly relies on
sampling and surveys from the infected people. For example, Guan et al., (2020) made a summary statistics
of incubation period based on the 291 patients who had claimed a clear specific exposure date. Their results
stated that the median incubation period is four days. Backer et al., (2020) estimated the distribution of
incubation period using 88 samples that had the travel history from Wuhan, and showed that the Weibull
distribution fits the data best and the mean incubation period is 6.4 days (95% credible interval (CI): 5.6–
7.7). Qin et al., (2020) utilized the renewal process to estimate the distribution of incubation period using
1211 samples who had clear dates of departure from Wuhan and dates of symptoms onset. They suggested
that the median incubation period is 8.13 days (95% CI: 7·37-8·91) and mean incubation period is 8.62 (95%
CI: 8.02-9.28).
However, the above-mentioned methods suffer several drawbacks. First, surveys are always along with
errors, such as sampling error, coverage error, and measurement error. The sample size of current research
ranges from 88 to 1211. Under the limitation of sample size, it is challenging to make a reliable estimation
of incubation period distribution. Second, when surveying, the patients’ recall bias is inevitable, which may
also lead to erroneous results. Some patients may not know the exact exposure date, or maybe lack of the
memory of exposure history. Therefore, the exposure dates may not be accurately monitored and recorded.
Last but not least, the judgment of contact trackers will also influence the determination and record of the
exposure date, thus influencing the accuracy of the estimation of incubation period. To address the above
shortcomings, we draw on the idea of the SEAIR model and propose a novel method to infer the probability
distribution of the incubation period of COVID-19 based on the daily confirmed case number. Contrary to
the traditional survey method, the proposed method reduces the dependence on survey data.

2. Method

Since the simple SIR model was proposed by William et al. in 1927, a large number of advanced
epidemiological models have been generated on this basis to explain different kinds of real word infectious
disease transmission (Calatayud et al., 2018; Chinazzi et al., 2020; Mizumoto et al., 2020; Arino & Portet,
2020). In the specific context of COVID-19, we proposed a SEAIR epidemic model with a time delay that
follows a discrete random probability distribution (Figure 1).
Figure 1 here
In this model, we define the total population of the target country as N, and all the people in this country
can be divided into five epidemiological classes, S, E, A, I, and R, respectively. We call
susceptible individuals in the country at time t,

the number of exposed individuals at time t,

number of infected people with symptoms at time t,
asymptomatic at time t, and

the number of
the

the number of infected people who are

the number of removed individuals including recovered and dead cases at

time t. Then, we have

. In order to model discrete incubation periods, the

following assumptions are established based on several previous studies about COVID-19:
(A1) The whole population of the target country N is constant over time since the international
transportation of most countries are strictly restricted after the outbreak of COVID-19 (Chinazzi et al., 2020;
Salcedo et al., 2020).
(A2) There is a damping effect on the virus reproduction rate due to the government's containment effort,
and this effect can be modeled through an exponentially decreasing function (Lanteri et al., 2020). Namely,

(A3) Asymptomatic individuals are hard to be recorded, and their number accounts for a certain ratio of all
infected people (Mizumoto et al., 2020). Namely,
(A4) Once the infected people develop symptoms, they will be recorded and quarantined just on the day of
the onset. Therefore, they will lose the ability to spread the virus after this day. On the contrary,
asymptomatic individuals can infect others continually since they are difficult to identify (Li et al., 2020).
Namely,
Based on the above-mentioned assumptions, we try to describe the dynamic process from group E to
group A and I, including a discrete-time delay. The newly added symptomatic and asymptomatic cases’
number can be interpreted as the number of all exposed individuals who were infected before day t and
become sick on day t. Through this logic, we can define the sum of

and

as follow:
(1)

In this equation,

is the probability of the exposed individual having a k-day incubation period. Also,
. Therefore

because of the assumption A3, we have

(2)
To make this equation calculable, we set a threshold k, which represents the maximum length of the
incubation periods that this epidemic could have. In other words, the probability of exposed individuals
generated before day

falling ill on day t is zero.

In a T days long time window where

, this problem can be transformed into a problem of solving

multivariate linear equations. Given a T length time series, we define

We can estimate P through minimizing the least square cost function of the multivariate linear equations

However, due to the high-dimensional characteristic of this objective function, this task is likely to have
a lot of local minima which makes it hard for standard optimization methods because there is a strong
dependency on the initial condition. We employ the basin-hopping algorithm, a global optimization method
introduced by Wales et al. in 1998 to obtain the estimation of P.

3. Results
We retrieve the publicly available data of the COVID-19’s confirmed, recovered, and death cases from
ministries of health in eight countries from January 21 to April 13. Yang et al. (2020) estimate that the
reproduction rate of COVID-19 is 3.77, using 8,866 cases recorded in China. Referring to their work, the
value of R0 in our model is also set to 3.77. Meanwhile, based on recent research about the Diamond

Princess ship event (Mizumoto et al., 2020), the estimated asymptomatic proportion among all infected
cases is about 17.9%. Thus, we value

to 22% (The ratio of asymptomatic patients to symptomatic patients

is 1 to 4.56). Besides, since several epidemiological studies have proven that the incubation period of
COVID-19 is hardly longer than 20 days (99th percentile) (Jing et al., 2020; Backer et al., 2020), so we set
the threshold k to 20. We use the historical data of one month after the outbreak of each country to calculate
P and use spline to construct the probability distribution of the incubation period. Figure 2 shows the
estimated incubation period distribution when

is set to 0.1. The subgraph on the left side presents the

results of each country and the overall mean value of these countries, and the child plot in the top right
corner presents the changing of reproduction number when

equals 0.1. The shade part of the subgraph on

the right side is the 95% pointwise confidence interval (CI) of the estimated distribution.
Figure 2 here
As we can see in Figure 2, basically, among all the studied countries, the inference results are similar. In
this estimated incubation period probability distribution, the distribution reaches its peak on the fourth day,
meaning a person infected with COVID-19 is most likely to have a four-day incubation period. However,
in the real-world situation, we cannot identify the ‘real’ , which indicates the effect of the countries’
measures on suppressing the spread of epidemics. Accordingly, we also operate sensitivity analysis to

to

test the stability of our estimation, and the results have been shown in Figure 3.
Figure 3 here
With five different values of , our predicted distribution still maintains a similar shape and consistent
peak position. But as

becomes larger, the distribution becomes more and more smooth. We list the

expectation, the median, and the 95th percentile under these five different conditions in table 1.
Table 1 here
Comparing with several current studies about COVID-19’s incubation period (Li et al., 2020; Guan et
al., 2020; Backer et al., 2020; Linton et al., 2020), our listed inferences’ results are quite close to theirs,
especially when

is equal to 0.01 or 0.05. This phenomenon might imply the fact that, after the outbreak

of COVID-19, most countries did not operate efficiently and urgently to suppress the spreading of the virus.

4. Discussion

In this paper, we introduce an epidemic-model-based approach to inference the distribution of the
incubation period of the COVID-19, and our results are in line with the existing studies. The contributions
of this paper are twofold. First, based on the transmission process depicted by the established epidemic
model, our proposed method infers the distribution of incubation period from the overall daily confirmed
cases number reported by each countries’ governments. Therefore, our method avoids the drawbacks
associated with traditional survey-based methods. Second, distinct with the traditional methods, our
approach doesn't need to make prior assumptions about the distribution of the incubation periods. We
provide a more actual estimation result that is closer to the “real” situation to some extent. Nevertheless,
because the proposed approach is based on the prior knowledge of COVID-19, such as reproduction rate,
asymptomatic proportion, government's containment effort, and so on, which is needed to depict the
transmission process, our results are sensitive to the setting of parameters. Thus, to make reliable inference
using this method, information about the virus provided by prior researches are necessary.
