The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the coronavirus infectious disease
(COVID-19) has become a pandemic. Social (physical) distancing is a key
non-pharmacologic control measure to reduce the transmission rate of SARSCOV-2, but high-level adherence is needed. Using daily travel distance and
stay-at-home time derived from large-scale anonymous mobile phone location
data provided by Descartes Labs and SafeGraph, we quantify the degree
to which social distancing mandates have been followed in the U.S. and its
effect on growth of COVID-19 cases. The correlation between the COVID19 growth rate and travel distance decay rate and dwell time at home change
rate was -0.586 (95% CI: -0.742∼-0.370) and 0.526 (95% CI: 0.293∼0.700),
1

respectively. Increases in state-specific doubling time of total cases ranged
from 1.04∼6.86 days to 3.66∼30.29 days after social distancing orders were
put in place, consistent with mechanistic epidemic prediction models. Social
distancing mandates reduce the spread of COVID-19 when they are followed.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is a global threat with escalating health,
economic and social challenges.

As of April 11, 2020, there had been 492,416 total

confirmed cases and 18,559 total deaths in the U.S. according to the reports of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (1). People are still witnessing widespread community
transmission of the COVID-19 all over the world. Presently, there is neither a vaccine nor
pharmacologic agent found to reduce the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. Thus, the effects of nonpharmacological epidemic control and intervention measures including travel restrictions,
closures of schools and nonessential business services, wearing of face masks, testing, isolation
and timely quarantine on delaying the COVID-19 spread have been largely investigated and
reported (6, 15, 20, 26, 32). To mitigate and ultimately contain the COVID-19 epidemic, one
of the important (non-pharmacological) control measures to reduce the transmission rate of
SARS-COV-2 in the population is social (physical) distancing. An interactive web-based
mapping platform (in Fig. 1A) that provides timely quantitative information on how people
in different counties and states reacted to the social distancing guidelines was developed (13).
It integrates geographic information systems (GIS) and daily updated human mobility statistical
patterns derived from large-scale anonymized and aggregated smartphone location big data at
the county-level in the U.S. (23, 27, 34, 39). The primary goal of the online platform is to
increase risk awareness among the public, support governmental decision-making, and help
2

enhance U.S. community responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.
It is worth noting that reduced mobility does not necessarily ensure the social (physical)
distancing in practice following the CDC’s definition: “Stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) from
other people” (2). Due to the mobile phone GPS horizontal error and uncertainty (12), such
physical distancing patterns cannot be directly identified from the used aggregated mobility
data; it requires other wearable sensors or bluetooth trackers, which raise issues of personal
data privacy and ethical concerns (5). Because COVID-19 is twice as contagious and far more
deadly than seasonal flu, social (physical) distancing is critical in our fight to save lives and
prevent suffering. However, so far, to what degree such guidelines have been followed from
place to place before and after shelter-in-place orders across the U.S. and the quantitative effect
on flattening the curve were unknown.
To this end, we employed two social distancing metrics: the median of individual maximum
travel distance and the home dwell time derived from large-scale mobile phone location data (in
Fig. 1 B-C) provided by Descartes Labs and SafeGraph to assess the effectiveness of stay-athome policies on curbing the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. For each state, we examined
these measures against the growth rate of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Findings
The relationship between the mobility changes and the growth of the
infected population
By fitting the curves for the state-specific confirmed cases from March 11 to April 10, 2020
using a scaling law formula (24), we were able to identify the top five states with the
largest growth rates of confirmed cases: New York, New Jersey, California, Michigan, and
Massachusetts. Our fitting results corresponded to the up-to-date COVID-19 situation so far
(Tables S1 and S2). Fig. 2A-E show the reported cases and the fitting curves in these five states
3

using the formulas yc = tb + k and yc = aebt , where yc is the total number of confirmed cases
in each state, t is the number of days from the declared date of the pandemic: March 11, 2020,
and a, b, k are the parameters we need to estimate (in supplementary materials). Meanwhile,
we used linear regression to detect the travel distance decreasing rate over time. The Pearson’s
correlation coefficient between the cases growth rate and the distance decay rate was -0.586
(95% CI: [-0.742, -0.370], p-value <0.00001). Fig. 2F shows the state-level correlation between
the growth coefficients of confirmed cases and the travel distance decay coefficients across the
nation. The moderate negative relationship indicated that in the states where the confirmed
cases were growing faster, people responded more actively and quicker by reducing their daily
travel distance.

The relationship between the stay-at-home duration changes and the
growth of the infected population
We also fitted the curve for the home dwell time changes for each state using the scaling and
linear models, and calculated the correlation between the home dwell time increasing rate and
the growth rate of the total number of infected people. The two change rates have a positive
correlation of 0.526 (95% CI: [0.293, 0.700], p-value < 0.0001), which means that in areas with
higher cases growth rates, people responded better and stayed at home for longer time.
The results of two above-mentioned association analyses both showed that there existed
dramatic mobility reduction in response to the fast growth of the COVID-19 cases and people
in most states reacted to the social distancing guidelines by reducing daily travel distance and
increasing stay-at-home time. In return, the overall trend of reducing growth rates of cases was
found later across different states although the geographic variation still existed.

4

The effect of social distancing on delaying the epidemic doubling time
Specifically, we investigated how the social distancing guidelines and stay-at-home orders
(Table S5) affected the epidemic doubling time of confirmed cases (from March 11 to April 10)
in each state. We used mathematical curve fitting models and mechanistic epidemic prediction
models using Bayesian parametric estimation of the serial interval distribution of successive
cases to cross validate the conclusion (7, 31). The fitted curves by an exponential model and
a power-law model are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S2. For the exponential model (Table S10),
before the statewide stay-at-home orders, initial estimates of the growth rates of the number
of infected people for the outbreak in each state were 0.17∼0.70 per day with a doubling time
of 1.30∼4.34 days (median: 2.59 days; IQR: 0.752). A similar result was found by fitting the
power-law model (Table S11), in which initial estimates of the growth rates before the orders
in each state were 0.12∼0.71 per day with a doubling time of 1.30∼6.18 days (median: 2.71
days; IQR: 0.915). The finding aligned well with the doubling time of 2.3∼3.3 days in the
early outbreak epicenter Wuhan, China (28). After the orders, the estimates of the growth rate
in each state by the exponential model were reduced to 0.03∼0.21 per day with a doubling
time increased to 3.69∼27.72 days (median: 5.68 days; IQR: 2.203). Similarly, the estimates
of the growth rate in each state by the power-law model were reduced to 0.02∼0.17 per day
with a doubling time increased to 4.31∼29.77 days (median: 6.27 days; IQR: 2.457). The
finding also aligned well with the result from the observed epidemiological data (Table 1), in
which the empirical growth rate in each state was 0.11∼0.95 per day with a doubling time of
1.04∼6.86 days (median: 2.69 days; IQR: 1.011) before the statewide stay-at-home orders, and
reduced to 0.02∼0.21 per day with a doubling time increased to 3.66∼30.29 days (median:
5.98 days; IQR: 2.345) after the orders. The exponential equation approach was particularly
suitable during the early outbreak phase and our curve fitting results matched the outcomes of
mechanistic epidemic prediction models (Fig. S5 and S6 in supplementary materials), such as
5

the models reported by (7, 31). These models used confirmed cases and the serial interval, that
is the days between two successive infected cases.
Besides, we investigated the overall probability density distribution of the doubling time
nationwide before and after the orders using the state-level median doubling time (Fig. 4A, S3
and S4). The doubling time nationwide has increased from mainly 1∼6 days to 3∼14 days after
the stay-at-home orders. The results about the doubling time all confirmed the effectiveness of
social distancing in slowing down the COVID-19 transmission and in flattening the curve. The
Ten-Hundred plot (Fig. 4B) (3) also shows that the case growth rate in each state (e.g., New
York, New Jersey, Michigan, California, and Massachusetts) slowed down after the stay-athome orders (approaching sub-exponential growth).

Discussion
This study demonstrated a statistical relationship between two social distancing measures (travel
distance and stay-at-home dwell time) and the growth rate of COVID-19 confirmed cases across
U.S. states. The statistical variation of the two social distancing measures can be largely
explained (with R-squared 0.60∼0.69) by geographic and socioeconomic factors, including
state policies, race and ethnicity, population density, age groups, and median household income
(see Table S6-S9 in supplementary materials). Recent studies also identified partisan differences
in Americans’ response to social distancing guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic (4).
One issue requires attention is that other control measures such as quarantine and enhanced
personal protective procedures may also be implemented concurrently and there were no control
experiments to compare such effects separately. The predictive modeling results also vary
across states and the doubling time is dynamic. All these factors contribute to the endogeneity
of findings (17).
Great efforts have been made in scientific research communities on the study of human
6

mobility patterns using various emerging data sources, including anonymized mobile phone call
detail records (11, 14, 19, 30, 37), social media (e.g., Twitter) (16), location-based services and
mobile apps (29, 35). During the COVID-19 pandemic, both individual-level and aggregatedlevel human mobility patterns have been found useful in epidemic modeling and digital contact
tracing (5,10,22,32). However, technical challenges (e.g., location uncertainty), socioeconomic
and sampling bias (18, 21, 36, 38), privacy and ethical concerns are raised by the national and
international societies (8, 9, 25, 33). Moving forward, research efforts will continue in exploring
the balance of using such human mobility data for social goods while preserving individual
rights. In summary, this study quantifies the effect of social distancing mandates on reducing
the spread of COVID-19 when they are followed.
