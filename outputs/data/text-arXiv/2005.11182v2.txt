Abstract
The presence of a large number of infected individuals with few
or no symptoms is an important epidemiological difficulty and the
main mathematical feature of COVID-19. The A-SIR model, i.e. a
SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) model with a compartment for
infected individuals with no symptoms or few symptoms was proposed
by Giuseppe Gaeta, arXiv:2003.08720 [q-bio.PE] (2020). In this paper
we investigate a slightly generalized version of the same model and
propose a scheme for fitting the parameters of the model to real data
using the time series only of the deceased individuals. The scheme
is applied to the concrete cases of Lombardy, Italy and São Paulo
state, Brazil, showing different aspects of the epidemics. For each case
we show that we may have good fits to the data up to the present,
but with very large differences in the future behavior. The reasons
behind such disparate outcomes are the uncertainty on the value of
a key parameter, the probability that an infected individual is fully
symptomatic, and on the intensity of the social distancing measures

1

adopted. This conclusion enforces the necessity of trying to determine
the real number of infected individuals in a population, symptomatic
or asymptomatic.

Introduction

Although there are good models for predicting the time evolution of an epidemic of diseases such as influenza or measles, models of the same type are not
working for the COVID-19. An important feature of the COVID-19 is that
it may be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in some patients, although
causing severe respiratory symptoms in others. patients. As a consequence,
there is a large number of undocumented infections [10].
The lack of tests for assessing the health state of large samples of the
populations contributes to the spread of the COVID-19, as asymptomatic
individuals may not isolate themselves. Although there is no clear distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic, in this paper we will use the
acronym MSA (mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic) to mean a case of
COVID-19 weak enough for not causing death or lead to hospitalization and
probably unreported due to the lack of tests.
We consider that a good step towards a good predicting model for COVID19 has been taken in [6]. In Sect. 2 we will describe a slight generalization of
the A-SIR model proposed in that work and use it in the rest of this paper in
predicting the possible evolution of the COVID-19 epidemics in Lombardy,
Italy and São Paulo state, Brazil.
The A-SIR model is just the traditional SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed)
model for epidemics, introduced by Kermack and McKendrick [8] almost 100
years ago, with one extra compartment for accounting the MSA infected individuals. The MSA can still transmit the disease to susceptible individuals,
but, as they mostly ignore their condition, it is reasonable that they will
remain for larger periods transmitting the disease when compared to fully
symptomatic individuals, which will probably isolate themselves after a few
days. Of course, when the epidemic is already well developed, a large fraction
of the population may have been MSA infected, and, as these individuals are
healed, they will contribute to largely decrease the number of susceptible
people.
2

Although the proportion of symptomatic cases has already been estimated
to be 16% for the development of the disease in China [10], we will take the
liberty to explore the possibility that this proportion may be larger or smaller.
As a support to the possibility that there are less symptomatic cases than
previously estimated, we cite one among the many reports by the Imperial
College COVID-19 response team [5]. Referring to 11 European countries,
the report states that “In all countries, we estimate there are orders of magnitude fewer infections detected than true infections, mostly likely due to mild
and asymptomatic infections as well as limited testing capacity”. Figure 2
in that report illustrates that.
Supporting the other possibility, Lavezzo et al. [9] state that at Vò, Italy,
the asymptomatic cases were a fraction of 43.2% of the total. Although
clearly casting some doubt, we also cite [7]. The paper states “Among the
participants with positive results for SARS-CoV-2, symptoms of Covid-19
were reported (...) by 57% of those in the overall population-screening group.
However, 29% of participants who tested negative in the overall populationscreening group also reported having symptoms”.
One reason for the uncertainty in the outcome of mathematical models
for COVID-19 is that the models usually contain parameters for which reasonable values are taken, but sometimes without full scientific support. In
particular, the models are extremely sensitive to the infection rate β0 , see
(1). We will show in this paper how to ignore the data on the number of
currently infected people. These are prone to a large uncertainty, because of
the MSA cases, but also underreporting of the symptomatic cases due to the
lack of tests. We will use only the data on the number of deaths due to the
COVID-19, expected to be more faithful. We will restrict for the time being
to the study of the development of COVID-19 in Lombardy and in the state
of São Paulo. Both cases result in good fits of the model to the data. It will
turn out that an important part of the fitting procedure is the way of tuning
the value of the infection rate β0 to the data.
An important question is what will happen when the social distancing
measures currently in act in most countries are relaxed. One bad possibility
is that a second wave of COVID-19 will arise. If not mitigated, the potential
number of deaths in the second wave may be larger than the deaths in the
first wave. Another possibility is that sufficient herd immunity will have been
acquired by the populations after the present epidemic and no large increase
of cases should happen after relaxation of the social distancing.
We will show in this paper that neither of the above possibilities can be
3

ruled out for Lombardy. Part of our ignorance is due to the fact that one
key parameter of the A-SIR model, the probability that a newly infected
individual is symptomatic, is still largely unknown. Another reason for not
being able to predict the future of the epidemic is that we do not know how
much the social distancing measures adopted were effective in reducing the
infection rate of the model.
In the case of São Paulo state, Brazil, the fraction of deaths up to now is
much smaller than in Lombardy. Although this is good, it also means that the
population is still very susceptible. Strong economic pressure is being exerted
on politicians for relaxation of the social distancing measures. We predict
that even in the best of the possibilities, the number of infected individuals
will steadily grow for a large period and in its peak it will be much larger
than present values. Thus, social distancing measures should not be relaxed
before the number of infected individuals is small. We see that the increase
in the number of cases may be catastrophic if social distancing measures are
not strengthened.
The paper is organized as follows. Sect. 2 starts with a mathematical
description of the model and all its parameters. Then we will talk about the
linear regime, i.e. the behavior of the solutions of the model for a short time
after the beginning of the epidemic. Finally, we will describe conditions for
the population fraction of infected individuals to decrease and also the limit
behavior after the epidemic is finished. Sect. 3 describes the procedure for
finding values of the parameters such that the output of the A-SIR model fits
well the deaths data, both in Lombardy and in São Paulo. The paper is closed
by Sect. 4, in which we draw some conclusions on the results obtained, and
by Sect. 5, in which we account for some changes in the conclusions because
of new data released during the time the paper was being written.

The A-SIR model

Let S(t), I(t), A(t) and R(t) be the population fractions at time t respectively
of susceptible, symptomatic infected, MSA infected and removed individuals. By susceptible, we mean individuals which were not yet infected by the
SARS-Cov-2 virus. By symptomatic we mean fully symptomatic individuals
and by MSA we mean individuals which have either no symptoms, or few
symptoms. By removed we mean individuals which were either healed after
infection, or deceased. The fraction of removed individuals is composed by
4

the sum of symptomatic removed Rs (t) and MSA removed individuals Ra (t),
according to whether the individuals were fully symptomatic before removal,
or had mild or no symptoms. The time span we are going to consider is of
a few months, thus we may ignore births and deaths by reasons other than
infection. In particular, we suppose that MSA or susceptible individuals do
not die and that all infected individuals do not become susceptible again, at
least for the time span we are considering.
The A-SIR model is described by the following set of nonlinear ordinary
differential equations:
 0
S (t) = −β0 S(I + µA)




 I 0 (t) = β0 ξS(I + µA) − γs I
A0 (t) = β0 (1 − ξ)S(I + µA) − γa A .
(1)

0

R (t) = γs I


 0s
Ra (t) = γa A
The latter two equations are not essential for solving the system. In fact,
we may calculate Rs and Ra simply by integrating respectively I(t) and
A(t). Another simple property of the model, proved by summing all the 5
equations, is that the sum of the fractions S, I, A, Rs and Ra is a constant.
If we take µ = 1, this is exactly the same model as in [6], although with
different notation.
All parameters above are considered to be positive and are interpreted as
follows:
• β0 is the infection rate of symptomatic individuals;
• µ ∈ (0, 1] is a reduction factor such that the infection rate for the MSA
is µβ0 ;
• ξ ∈ (0, 1) is the probability that a new infection event leads to a symptomatic case;
• γs and γa are respectively the inverses of the mean time symptomatic
and MSA individuals remain infective. We suppose that γs > γa .
The mean removal time for symptomatic individuals will be considered to
be around a week. This does not mean that individuals with symptoms will
be healed after one week, but that these individuals, after showing symptoms
for some days will either be hospitalized, or stay isolated at home. We will
5

take then γs = 1/7 (days)−1 . Following [6], we will take γa = 1/21 (days)−1 ,
meaning that MSA individuals will remain active in the population for a
larger time than symptomatic individuals.
We believe that we may take values such as above for γs and γa without
risk of overestimating or underestimating the size of the epidemics. Other
values could have been considered, but would not change the main conclusions. In the following we will explain how to use mortality data to infer the
value of the contact rate β0 . It will turn out that the value of the parameter
µ will not alter almost anything in the numeric predictions. On the contrary,
we will see that the remaining parameter ξ alters drastically the outcome of
the model in the future.
As a preparation for understanding things to come, we show in Fig. 1
a typical graph of the fractions S, I, A and Rs as functions of time for
a seemingly reasonable choice of parameters. The graphs are obtained by
numerically solving Eqs. (1).
For this choice of parameters, note that about 65% of the population
are symptomatic removed 100 days after the start of the epidemic. Another
thing to notice in the graphs of Fig. 1 is that, although we used ξ = 2/3
expecting to obtain that 2/3 of the cases are symptomatic, this does not
happen. In fact, by time t = 40 the fraction of MSA is larger than the
number of symptomatic individuals, even considering that the probability of
a case being symptomatic is larger than the probability of a MSA case. The
reason for obtaining a large number of MSA individuals is not related to ξ,
but to the fact that the mean time γa−1 that an individual takes as MSA is
larger than the mean time γs−1 taken by a symptomatic individual.
To better understand an important issue, in Fig. 2 we plot, for the
same set of parameters and initial conditions, the ratio I(t)/(I(t) + A(t))
of symptomatic to total cases. The figure shows that, because of the initial
condition I(0) = A(0), the ratio of symptomatic to total infected individuals
starts equal to 1/2. After a transient, it becomes almost constant around
0.6, not 2/3, and then decays to 0. Part of this behavior will be explained in
the next subsection.

2.1

The linear regime

Another feature of the A-SIR model, already noticed in [6], is that the fraction
S(t) is very well approximated by 1 for the initial times. We may use this to
approximate the solution of Eqs. (1) for small times. Substituting S(t) by 1

which is a linear system of ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients. Although the exact system (1) cannot be exactly solved, its linear

As M is 2 × 2, its eigenvalues can be easily calculated as roots of a quadratic
polynomial. It can be shown that the eigenvalues of M are always real and
that the smaller of them, denoted λ− , is negative. The larger eigenvalue of
M will be denoted λ+ and is positive, provided that β0 is not too small, as
will be seen ahead. Although the formula for λ+ in terms of the parameters
of the model is somewhat large, we may invert it and find a rather simple
formula for β0 as a function of λ+ and the remaining parameters:
β0 =

(λ+ + γs )(λ+ + γa )
.
(λ+ + γa )ξ + (λ+ + γs )µ(1 − ξ)

In Sect. 3, we will use the above formula along with an estimate of λ+ derived
from the data to fix the parameter β0 .
A straightforward, but lengthy, calculation shows that for any initial conditions the solution of Eqs. (2) satisfies

(6)

In the above equation λ+ and β0 are related through Eq. (4). For the parameter values of Fig. 2 we have ρ = 0.610411, which is approximately the
height of the plateau in that graph.
This agreement illustrates the more general fact that the exact solution
of Eq. (2) is a good approximation to the true solution of Eq. (1) at the
beginning of the epidemic. Of course, the exact solution of Eqs. (2) breaks
down as an approximation for larger times. This is also shown in Fig. 2,
I(t)
is not always close to the value defined in Eq. (6).
because I(t)+A(t)
Another consequence of Fig. 2 is that the ratio of symptomatic to total
infected individuals is a dynamic quantity. It cannot be included as a parameter in the model’s equations as in [10]. Moreover, as shown by Eq. (6), not
I(t)
is approximately
even for the small interval of time in which the ratio I(t)+A(t)
constant, it equals parameter ξ.
We will call linear regime the time interval in which the true solution of
(1) is well approximated by the solution of (2). For the parameter values in
Figs. 1 and 2 the linear regime lasts approximately up to time t = 25, in
which the fractions of symptomatic and MSA individuals are already quite
high.
In the linear regime, any of the quantities I(t), A(t), Rs (t) and R(t) are
approximated by exact solutions having the form c1 eλ+ t + c2 eλ− t , where c1
and c2 are constants depending of which quantity we are calculating. As the
term eλ− t quickly tends to 0, we see that I(t), A(t), Rs (t) and R(t) are all
approximated by c1 eλ+ t , i.e., all of them are exponentially growing in the
linear regime whenever λ+ > 0. Most importantly, all of them grow at the
same rate determined by the largest eigenvalue λ+ . For this reason, λ+ is
called the Malthusian parameter of the model [2].

9

2.2

Conditions for the fraction of infected individuals
to decrease

It can be shown [2] that the total fraction of infected individuals I(t) + A(t)
in the solutions of (1) will decrease for all t > 0 if and only if λ+ ≤ 0.
The same condition is generally written in terms not of λ+ , but of the basic
reproduction ratio R0 . R0 is defined as the mean number of individuals
infected by a single infected individual during its whole infective period if
the population is entirely susceptible. If R0 ≤ 1, it can be shown that the
number of infected individuals will initially decrease and always decrease in
the A-SIR model. It is straightforward to calculate R0 for the A-SIR model
following any of the recipes given in [2]. The result is


µ(1 − ξ)
ξ
+
.
(7)
R0 = β0
γs
γa
As commented before, the Malthusian parameter λ+ will be positive if β0 is
sufficiently large. The exact condition is exactly that the right-hand side in
the above equation is larger than 1, i.e. β0 > γs γa /(γa ξ + γs µ(1 − ξ)).
If R0 > 1 and the whole population is susceptible, the total number of
infected individuals will initially increase, but as the number of susceptible
individual decreases, contagion becomes more difficult, and, consequently,
the total number of infected will reach a maximum at some time t∗ . In the
simpler SIR model, it can be shown that t∗ is the time such that S(t∗ ) =
1/R0 . In the A-SIR model, no such simple condition exists, as we have two
types of infected individuals and the number of one type may increase at the
same time the other decreases. An instance of that is shown in Fig. 1 in the
interval between the maximum point of I and the maximum point of A.
Gaeta [6] provided conditions for each of the fractions I and A to decrease. As Fig. 2 illustrates, whenever γs > γa and t is large enough, the
fraction of MSA individuals is much larger than the fraction of symptomatic
infected individuals, so that I(t) + A(t) ≈ A(t). We may use this fact to
give an approximate condition for the fraction of total infected individuals
to decrease.
In fact, the third equation in (1) shows that A(t) decreases whenever
S(t) <

times, we get the approximate condition
S(t) <

β0 (1 − ξ)µ

(8)

for the decrease of the total number of infected individuals. We stress that
the above condition is approximate and holds whenever γs > γa and t is large
enough.
Notice that the threshold in the right-hand side of (8) is higher for smaller
β0 . As S(t) starts close to 1 and decreases, the threshold will be easier to
attain if β0 is smaller. In other words, if β0 is small, less people have to be
infected in order that the number of infected individuals starts to decrease.

2.3

The asymptotic equilibrium

All solutions of the A-SIR equations (1) converge as t → ∞ to the diseasefree equilibrium in which S = S∞ , I and A are both null and R = 1 − S∞ .
For a very contagious virus such as SARS-Cov-2, i.e. for large β0 , S∞ is close
to 0. In other words, almost the entire population is eventually infected
in an unmitigated epidemic caused by a sufficiently contagious virus. This
is illustrated in Fig. 1, in which S∞ can be numerically calculated to be
0.0181302.
Individuals exit the susceptible compartment of the model either as symptomatic or MSA infected, and they do so at ratios ξ and 1 − ξ, respectively.
Since they will eventually become either symptomatic removed, or MSA removed, then the symptomatic removed and MSA removed fractions at equilibrium obey
ξ
Rs (∞)
=
.
Ra (∞)
1−ξ
Moreover, Rs (∞) + Ra (∞) = 1 − S∞ . Solving the set formed by the latter
two equations, we obtain that Rs (∞) = (1 − S∞ )ξ. In the important case of
a very contagious virus,
Rs (∞) ≈ ξ .
(9)
This approximation is also well illustrated in Fig. 1.

Fitting the A-SIR model to real COVID-19
epidemic data

According to Crisanti [1] and Fenga [3], the lack of efficient testing has been
responsible for a substantial underestimation of the number of cases in the
COVID-19 epidemic in Italy. In particular, probably due to testing preferentially the most severe cases, the mortality rate in the regions of Lombardy
and Emilia-Romagna was three times larger than in the neighboring region
of Veneto, in which testing for COVID-19 was widespread [1]. The same
problem caused by lack of tests is reported also in Brazil and elsewhere.
Because of this, we believe that the cumulative number of deaths is a much
more faithful indicator of the evolution of the epidemics than the number of
confirmed cases, both in Lombardy and in São Paulo. We chose the deaths
data in both locations as the sources for our fitting. This approach was also
taken e.g. in [5]. The official deaths data, plotted in Fig. 3, were collected
respectively in [12] and [13], along with the official numbers of confirmed
cases.
We need one extra parameter, ω, to relate the outcome of the model to
the number of reported deaths used here. In fact, the A-SIR model does not
make any prediction for the population fraction D(t) of individuals dead due
to COVID-19 up to time t. As only the symptomatic cases may die, it is

12

natural to suppose that
D(t) = ωRs (t) ,

(10)

where ω ∈ (0, 1) is thus interpreted as the case fatality rate. The value for ω
must also be found. As the lack of tests is a reality, an examination of data
for several countries, as in [14], shows that the ratio of deaths to confirmed
cases varies broadly among them.
Before entering into details, we describe the fitting procedure in general.
Both in Lombardy and in São Paulo state, the epidemic started uncontrolled.
Noticing the logarithmic vertical scale, we can see in both panels of Fig. 3
that in the first days the number of deaths seemed to increase exponentially,
as expected for the linear regime, see subsection 2.1. We will call these
first days as the phase of uncontrolled epidemic. After this phase, in both
locations the number of deaths started to increase at a lower rate. One of
the important things will be to assess whether this lower rate is a natural
consequence of the A-SIR model, or if it is due to the mitigation measures
adopted in both locations.
As will be fully explained in the following, the first step will be using the
deaths data in the uncontrolled epidemic phase to estimate the values of λ+
and ω.
In the next steps, for each phase of social distancing we will have another
parameter  indicating the intensity of the adopted measures. In Lombardy
we will consider two phases of different intensities 1 and 2 for the period
of social distancing. In São Paulo state, only one phase of social distancing
will be considered. We will see that it is possible to use the number of
deaths data to obtain estimates for ξ and for the intensities i . Although in
general an optimal choice for these parameters exists, we will see that many
possible choices are almost as good for the purpose of fitting the data with
the model. It results that more than one possible good fit of the model to the
data exists. We will explore the consequences of this approximate degeneracy
in the optimization procedure.
Since parameters γa and γe are fixed, as already explained, and β0 will
be related to λ+ by Eq. (4), the parameter µ still remains undetermined.
After several experiences we noticed that, as long as λ+ is determined and
β0 is related to it by (4), the results of the model are to large extent independent of µ. This is a consequence of the fact that the initial behavior of
the deaths number according to the model is dictated by the linear regime,
i.e., λ+ , whereas the final behavior is dictated by ξ, see Eq. (9). The above

phenomenon is illustrated in Fig. 4, in which the results of A-SIR numerical solutions with two different values of µ show no noticeable differences.
Thus, there will be no problem in adopting for µ any fixed value. We assume
µ = 0.5 for the rest of this paper.
The goodness of a fit between the number of deaths reported in the data
and the A-SIR model will be quantified by a cost function to be minimized.
For future reference, our choice of cost function is

In the above formula, besides other notations already introduced, N is the
total population of the location (Lomabardy or São Paulo state) and d is the
14

last day up to which the numbers of reported deaths D(i) are being compared
to the prediction of the model ωRs (i). We do not indicate the dependence of
the cost function on the fixed parameters γa = 1/21 and γs = 1/7. The cost
function also depends on the initial conditions to be used in the numerical
solution of the model’s differential equations. The initial conditions will be
specified when needed. The value of d depends on which data is used for
estimating the parameters. For example, for estimating λ+ and ω we will
take d to be the last day of the uncontrolled epidemic phase. For estimating
the intensity of social distancing measures, we will use a large value for d. Of
course neither the square root, nor the multiplication by N/d are necessary
in the definition of the cost function, but they are included for convenience.
We will describe first the fitting procedure for Lombardy, where more
data is available and then proceed to São Paulo state.

3.1

Fitting the epidemic in Lombardy

The national lockdown in Italy started on March 9, 2020, day number 14
after Feb. 24, the start date of the Italian time-series. We will define Mar.
9, 2020 to be the end of the uncontrolled epidemic phase for Lombardy.

the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases at day 0 was 166 [12], accounting
for the value of I(0). As the initial number of MSA is unknown, our choice
for A(0) is a natural one such that the fraction I(t)/(I(t) + A(t)) is equal to
ρ already at day 0, see (5) and (6). The initial condition for Rs (0) is also
the natural one using the number of people dead due to COVID-19 at day
0, obtained from the data [12], and taking into account Eq. (10).
We stress that the initial conditions for I(0) and A(0) are the only places
in our fitting procedure where some information on the number of confirmed
cases is used. We will not use such information in any other day. It is
conceivable that at day 0 the number of confirmed cases is more reliable
than in later days. Moreover, the exact values of I(0) and A(0) do not

matter so much, as I(t) and A(t) initially grow exponentially by a rate to be
determined by the number of deaths.
In Fig. 5 we show contour plots of the objective function c14 (λ+ , 0.1, 0.5, ω).
Observe that we are considering only the deaths data up to day 14, i.e. in
the uncontrolled epidemic phase. We arbitrarily fixed µ = 0.5 and ξ = 0.1.
The plots show that, for the chosen values of µ and ξ, in a large region in the
(λ+ , ω) plane the cost function has a single local minimum, which is probably a global minimum. The set of parameter values that minimizes the cost
function, i.e., provide the best fit of the model to the data up to day 14, is
λ+ = 0.3216, ω = 0.051.
Fig. 6 compares the epidemic data with the solution of Eqs. (1) with
initial conditions (12) and parameters γs = 1/7, γa = 1/21 (fixed), µ = 0.5,
ξ = 0.1 (arbitrarily chosen) and λ+ = 0.3216, ω = 0.051 (optimally chosen
with respect to the preceding values). The dots in the figure are the data for
D(i) divided by ω, and should thus approximate the curve for Rs (t) up to
t = 14. Numerical experiments (not presented for conciseness) with different
values for µ and ξ confirm that the graph Rs (t) up to t = 14, to be adjusted
to data, almost does not change. Thus, the fit shown in the figure remains

equally good independent of the values of µ and ξ. As already mentioned µ
is quite irrelevant as far as β0 is calculated as a function of λ+ . Also, the
value of ξ is not relevant for reproducing the first days of the epidemic.
It is well clear by Fig. 6 that after day 14 (start of the national lockdown
in Italy) the data increase less than the predicted Rs based on an uncontrolled epidemic. This is a good evidence that the lockdown was effectively
important in reducing the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in Lombardy.
We will incorporate the effect of social distancing measures in our model
by introducing a decrease of the infection rate β0 to a smaller value 1 β0 ,
where 0 < 1 < 1. More precisely, in order to avoid introducing a discontinuous function into the system of differential equations, we replace β0 in

where erf (z) = 2/ π 0 e−t dt is the integral of the normal distribution. The
graph of θ(t) is shown in Fig. 7. Any similar continuous function switching
from values close to 0 to values close to 1 in an interval around 0 of size 1
can be used without relevant changes. The important thing is that β(t) ≈ β0
for t < 14 and β(t) ≈ 1 β0 for t > 14.
In the second step of our fitting procedure, we will fix the values of λ+
and ω already estimated and evaluate the values for the intensity 1 of the
first phase of the lockdown, and parameter ξ, which was not relevant in the
uncontrolled epidemic phase. We referred above to the first phase of the
lockdown, because a strengthening of it occurred on Mar. 22, day 27 after
Feb. 24. Therefore, to estimate 1 and ξ we will use d = 27 in the cost
function, Eq. (11).

same values as in Fig. 6. Darker colors are smaller values and lighter colors

ξ and of the new parameter 1 . The left panel shows a larger region in (1 , ξ)
plane and the right panel shows in detail the region in which c27 attains its
smallest values. We notice that, contrary to the analogous plots in Fig. 5, in
which a clear global minimum is evidenced, this time the region where the
cost function is close to minimum seems like a large ”canyon”.
Referring to the darker area in the right panel of Fig. 8, we will call
optimistic choices for (1 , ξ) those points in the darker region with smaller
values of ξ. In fact, because of Eqs. (9) and (10), such a choice will lead to
a small expected number of dead people at the end of the epidemic. On the
contrary, points in the darker region with larger values of ξ will be called
pessimistic choices for (1 , ξ).
We show in Fig. 9 plots of two solutions to Eqs. (1) with optimization
up to day 27. Both choices for (1 , ξ) are almost equally good in fitting the

19

data for days 0 to 27, however the results on the left panel were obtained
with an optimistic choice for (1 , ξ), while the results on the right panel were
obtained by considering a pessimistic choice.
In both panels of Fig. 8 we also see that after day 27 the green dashed
curve of Rs (t) grows faster than the data points. This suggests us that the
strengthening of the lockdown in Lombardy after Mar. 22 did produce effects
in slowing down the number of deaths.
We will then introduce a further parameter 2 such that β(t) = 2 β0 for
t > 27. In order to see the effects of relaxing the social isolation measures,
we will also restore β(t) smoothly to its value β0 for t > 100. Precisely, we
will take
r(t) = 1 − (1 − 1 )θ(t − 14) − (1 − 2 )θ(t − 27) + (1 − 2 )θ(t − 100) . (16)
The value for 2 will be determined by minimizing the cost function up
to day 63, April 27. It turns out that the best choice for 2 will depend on
the choice made for ξ and 1 . In Fig. 10 we show the behavior of the cost
function, c63 , when varying 2 for both the optimistic and pessimistic choices
for (1 , ξ) already considered in Fig. 9.
As the final result of the fitting procedure for Lombardy, we show in Fig.
11 the graphs of the solutions to the A-SIR model with two different sets of
parameter values such that the model fits rather well the deaths data.
A conclusion to be drawn from the results in Fig. 11 is that the A-SIR
model can fit the deaths data for the epidemic in Lombardy extremely well
if we consider that the social distancing measures adopted there were less
intense from Mar. 9 to Mar. 22, days 14 to 27, and more intense from Mar.
22 to June 3, days 27 to 100. On the other hand, the goodness of the fits does
not tell us very much about the future, when the social distancing measures
are relaxed. Besides the two parameter choices shown, we have many others
almost as good as them. The choices shown here are extreme in the sense
that ξ = 0.04 is not too much above the minimum value of ξ for the points
in the darker region in the right panel of Fig. 8, and ξ = 0.5 is the maximum
value in the same region. Due to Eqs. (10) and (9), these are also close to the
extreme possibilities for the number of deaths at the end of the epidemics.
The optimistic choice, corresponding to the first row of Fig. 11, is such
that after complete relaxation of the social distancing, the number of cases
continues decreasing and the number of accumulated deaths increases slowly.
This happens because the fraction of susceptible individuals since day 38 falls

solutions if the epidemic remained uncontrolled, whereas the dashed lines in
corresponding colors show the effect of social distancing measures beginning

The remaining parameters are the optimal ones determined using the results

we called an optimistic choice. The right panel corresponds to a pessimistic
choice for the parameters.

Figure 11: Expected outcomes for the COVID-19 epidemic in Lombardy
for up to 150 days after Feb. 24, compared with the deaths data. We are
supposing, as a possibility, that the social isolation measures are completely
relaxed at day 100, June 3. An optimistic outcome is presented in the first
row, and a pessimistic in the second row. The plots in the left and right
columns differ only in the range of the vertical scale. The parameter values
valid for both rows are: γs = 1/7, γa = 1/21, λ+ = 0.3216, ω = 0.051,
µ = 0.5, see Fig. 6. For the first row only, 1 = 0.566, ξ = 0.04, 2 = 0.268.
For the second row only, 1 = 0.52, ξ = 0.5, 2 = 0.186. The red lines
γa
appearing in the second column are the graphs of β(t)(1−ξ)µ
, see Eq. (8).
Notice that with a good approximation, when the graph of S(t) is below the
red line, the fraction of MSA infected individuals decreases.

23

below the threshold in the right-hand side of Eq. (8) and does not increase
very much above it after the social isolation measures are removed at day
100.
On the other hand, for the pessimistic choice, depicted in the second
row of Fig. 11, the susceptible fraction is below the threshold in the righthand side of Eq. (8) between days 27 and 100. The red line representing
the threshold is not shown in the figure in this time interval, because the
threshold is larger than 1. But the susceptible fraction stays high above the
threshold after day 100, when social isolation measures are removed. As a
consequence, there is a fast increase of the number of cases after day 100, i.e.
a second wave of COVID-19 cases, potentially almost as intense as it would
have been if the epidemic remained uncontrolled since the beginning.
If we had more knowledge either on the value of ξ or on the values of 1
and 2 , we might choose among the most optimistic, the most pessimistic, or
some intermediate possibility between them. In the lack of such knowledge,
we present all possibilities.
The value of ξ could be estimated either by clinic research, or a large
scale population screening. We believe that such studies are on their ways,
and hope that their results might help us removing the uncertainties.
As far as 1 and 2 are concerned, some attempts have been made to
measure the intensity of the social distancing using cell phone localization
data, in particular for the regions in Italy [11]. A problem is that we do
not know how to relate these measures with the decreases 1 and 2 in the
infection rate.

3.2

Fitting the epidemic in São Paulo state

In Brazil the first imported case of COVID-19 was identified in the city of
São Paulo on Feb. 26, 2020. The first official death, also in São Paulo,
occurred on March 17, 2020. For this reason, we chose that date as day 0
for the epidemic in Brazil. Although there has been up to now no nationwide social distancing measures in Brazil, many state governors and mayors,
including the governor of São Paulo state, decreed such measures. It is
difficult to identify a clear starting date, as measures were gradual, but it
seems reasonable to choose Mar. 23, day number 6 after the first death, as
the end of the uncontrolled epidemic phase in the state of São Paulo. Mar.
23 was, in fact, the first day in which all schools were closed in São Paulo
state.
24

After the start of the social distancing measures, cell phone localization
data [15] show a tendency of slowly decreasing efficiency of these measures.
Although some metropolitan areas in Brazil have already declared lockdown,
no such measure has been declared at São Paulo up to the time of the latest
data shown in this paper, Apr. 29. As a consequence, we prefer to use a
single reduction of infection rates in fitting the epidemic in São Paulo.
The fitting procedure for São Paulo is thus similar to the one for Lombardy, with the exception that we use only one social distancing reduction
factor 1 for the entire period of the data. Taking into account that the
population of the state of São Paulo is N = 4.6 × 107 people, the initial
conditions used for the numerical solution of the ODEs (1) were
S(0) = 1, I(0) = 3.56522 × 10−6 ,
1
1−ρ
I(0), Rs (0) = 2.17391 × 10−8 .
A(0) =
ρ
ω

(17)

The choice of these conditions is analogous to what was done for Lombardy.
The uncontrolled epidemic phase lasted from day 0 (Mar. 17) to day 6
(Mar. 23). We used the deaths during that phase to obtain estimates for
λ+ and ω. Fig. 12 shows that the cost function c6 (λ+ , 0.1, 0.5, ω) apparently
has a global minimum at (λ+ , ω) = (0.302, 0.074).
After determining λ+ and ω, we used the deaths data up to day 43 to try
to determine the parameter ξ and the reducing factor 1 for the infection rate
during the social distancing measures started at day 6. Similar to Lombardy,
Fig. 13 shows a canyon shaped region in which the cost function c43 is close to
its minimum. The parameters used in the figure, besides the optimal values
for λ+ and ω, are specified in its caption.
As in the case of Lombardy, we are faced with the fact that good fits of
the A-SIR model with the deaths data can be obtained for a continuum of
values for ξ. For small values of ξ we have optimistic outcomes, in the sense
that the number of deaths at the end of the epidemic is smaller. For larger
values of ξ, we have pessimistic scenarios. Fig. 14 shows results both of an
optimistic and a pessimistic solution, with different vertical scales.
One important difference between the cases of São Paulo and Lombardy
is that the social distancing period started much earlier in São Paulo. As a
consequence, the fraction of deceased people in São Paulo is much smaller
up to now. The data points in the graphs of the second column in Fig. 14
are almost invisible. Of course, this is good, but it also has a bad side. In

Figure 14: Plots of expected outcomes for the COVID-19 epidemic in the
state of São Paulo for up to 150 days after Mar. 17. The blue dots compare
the results with epidemic deaths data. The optimistic and pessimistic outcomes are presented in the first and second row, respectively. The plots in
the different columns are different only in the range of the vertical scale. The
parameter values valid for both rows are: γs = 1/7, γa = 1/21, λ+ = 0.302,
ω = 0.074, µ = 0.5. For the first row only, 1 = 0.395, ξ = 0.02 and the
social isolation measures were relaxed at day 100. For the second row only,
1 = 0.445, ξ = 0.5 and the social isolation measures were relaxed only at
day 120. The red lines appearing in the second column are the graphs of
γa
, see Eq. (8). Notice that with a good approximation, when the
β(t)(1−ξ)µ
graph of S(t) is below the red line, the fraction of MSA infected individuals
decreases.
28

both optimistic and pessimistic cases the fraction of susceptible individuals
remains for a long period above the threshold in the right-hand side of Eq. (8).
Consequently, the fraction of infected individuals will be growing for a longer
time when compared to Lombardy.
In the optimistic case, we see that if the social distancing measures remain
with the present intensity until day 100 (Jun. 23), the fraction of infected
individuals will increase up to a maximum by day 80 and start decreasing. If
the social distancing measures are removed at day 100, the fraction of infected
individuals will resume growth for some days and then it will decrease again.
In the pessimistic case, the number of infected individuals will grow to
a number much larger than the present one. Even if the social distancing
measures are relaxed after day 120, there will still be a rapid increase in the
number of infected people.
In both cases, we predict that the number of infected individuals at
present will still increase considerably before attaining its peak value, which
will be by day 90 in the optimistic case, or by day 130 in the pessimistic case.
Given that the health services at São Paulo are already operating close to
their maximum capacity, in both cases we see that it is necessary that social
distancing is intensified in order to raise the threshold for the decrease of the
infected fraction and prevent their collapse.

Conclusions

The COVID-19 pandemic forced us, scientists, to tackle the difficult task of
trying to understand a new disease at the same time it is killing people in our
neighborhoods and stressing our health services. As shown in this paper, the
lack of solid knowledge on basic questions produces also an ignorance of what
may happen in the future, even the present situation being well described by
a simple mathematical model. We hope that more basic research may help
fill the knowledge gaps, but probably that will take time.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have seen many papers with
very different predictions on the population fraction that may die as a consequence of COVID-19, most of them too catastrophic. Part of this disparity
is due to our ignorance on basic facts about the virus and the disease, as already remarked, and on the number of mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic
cases. Another part is a consequence of the difficulty in estimating the many
parameters in any realistic mathematical model.
29

In this paper we used a model as simple as possible in order to have the
minimum number of parameters, and devised a procedure to estimate these
parameters based only on the more faithful data, the number of deaths. We
avoided using information on the number of confirmed cases, or trying to
guess underreporting factors. If we had considered more complete models,
we would probably have to estimate a larger number of parameters, resulting
on a larger uncertainty. We believe that our results, uncertain as they are,
may be useful in showing both a worst and a best possible outcome. One
important result of our calculations is that the epidemics both in Lombardy
and in São Paulo would have been much worse if social distancing measures
had not been taken.
We saw that in an optimistic possibility, the number of cases of COVID19 in Lombardy might not increase after the social distancing measures are
relaxed. However, we also saw that it is likely that the number of cases
shows a new quick rise, being then necessary either to keep these measures
for longer, or use alternative measures. As social distancing is being relaxed
at many countries, particularly in Italy, it is possible that the uncertainty in
our results will be solved in the next days according to whether the number
of cases will grow rapidly, or not.
In São Paulo state, as the fraction of infected individuals is up to now
much smaller than in Lombardy, herd immunity is still far. As a consequence,
our calculations predict that the fraction of infected individuals will still
increase for some time, even in the most optimistic case. As stressed before,
strengthening social distance measures could alleviate this situation.
We believe that the two locations in which we fitted the model to real
data may serve as examples of what may happen in other locations.

Post scriptum

As this paper was being written, more data became available both for Lombardy and for São Paulo state. The paper was finished on May 21, but in all
figures of Sect. 3 we decided to keep the data only up to Apr. 29, because
the conclusions would not change too much. We report in this section some
differences.
The strict lockdown in Italy ended on May 4, but social isolation measures
are being slowly relaxed. If we had added the most recent data to Fig. 11, we
would still have good fits of the data to the model in both cases, suggesting
30

that the infection rate has not yet increased very much.
If in Eq. (10) we use t = 85 and the datum for the population fraction of
deceased individuals up to that day, we obtain an estimate Rs (85) = 0.0306.
Taking into account Eq. (9) and the fact that Rs is an increasing function,
this means that although values of ξ smaller than 0.0306 are allowed by
Fig. 8, these must be ruled out. The optimistic value ξ = 0.04 used in
Fig. 11 remains as a possibility.
On May 13 appeared the first results of a serological study for a large random sample of the population in Spain [16]. Although we have not used any
data of Spain in this paper, one result in the cited report is interesting to consider here. On page 12 of [16] a map shows the percentages of people having
antibodies against SARS-COV-2 in all provinces of Spain. In the provinces
where the epidemic was stronger, these percentages vary between 10.9% and
14.2%. This means that the fraction of susceptible individuals varies between
0.858 and 0.891 in these provinces. Of course these susceptible fractions cannot be blindly extended to any other location, but if we extrapolate them
to Lombardy, that would also rule out the the optimistic value, ξ = 0.04,
because it produces values for the susceptible fraction considerably smaller.
Regarding the epidemic in São Paulo, Table 1 shows the ratio of the maximum predicted symptomatic infected individuals to the present value (day
65) of the same quantity in three situations: the pessimistic and optimistic
situations considered in Fig. 14, and an intermediate situation (graphs not
shown) with ξ = 0.12,  = 0.405 and social distance measures with the
present intensity up to day 120. The table also shows the predicted date of
the maximum.
We see that even in an optimistic situation, an increase of 38% in the
number of cases in only 16 days is expected from the results of the A-SIR
model. Intensified social distancing measures might help mitigating this situation. In the other two cases, the recommendation for intensifying social
distancing is of course still stronger.
