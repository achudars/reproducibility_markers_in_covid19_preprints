Abstract
We propose a dynamical model for describing the spread of epidemics. This model is an extension of the SIQR
(susceptible-infected-quarantined-recovered) and SIRP (susceptible-infected-recovered-pathogen) models used earlier to
describe various scenarios of epidemic spreading. As compared to the basic SIR model, our model takes into account
two possible routes of contagion transmission: direct from the infected compartment to the susceptible compartment
and indirect via some intermediate medium or fomites. Transmission rates are estimated in terms of average distances
between the individuals in selected social environments and characteristic time spans for which the individuals stay in
each of these environments. We also introduce a collective economic resource associated with the average amount of
money or income per individual to describe the socioeconomic interplay between the spreading process and the resource
available to infected individuals. The epidemic-resource coupling is supposed to be of activation type, with the recovery
rate governed by the Arrhenius-like law. Our model brings an advantage of building various control strategies to mitigate
the eﬀect of epidemic and can be applied, in particular, to modeling the spread of COVID-19.

1. Introduction
The spread of contagions, deceases, information, rumors, ideas, or concepts share many similarities. In most
cases, such spreading processes are governed by similar
models [1–6], which can vary in terms of complexity or approximations. The simplest dynamical models (see, e.g.,
Refs. [7–14]) have their origin in classical works [15–19].
More complex models include stochastic eﬀects [20–22],
spatial ﬂows (e.g., diﬀusion [23, 24]), or allow for nontrivial
spatial structure or topology [25–30]. One common feature
in the majority of these models is the presence of kinetic
coeﬃcients or parameters that characterize the probability
of elementary processes (reactions) per unit time.
For instance, contagion, infection, or decease spreading is associated with scattering of infected individuals on
the spatiotemporal ﬂuctuations of population density. The
probability of being infected is not a monotonous function
of population density [31, 32]. The probability of scattering of infected individuals on susceptible individuals
is lower at low densities, which results in a smaller total
scattering cross-section. At higher densities, the mobility
of spreaders decreases suppressing the spreading process.
Moreover, the scattering of spreaders on local populationdensity ﬂuctuations should determine the critical concenEmail addresses: lukyan@iop.kiev.ua (S. P. Lukyanets),

tration of secondary infected cases suﬃcient for the initiation of the collective process, i.e., an epidemic. The kinetic
description of spreading is generally quite a complicated
problem that should take account of the internal state of
spreaders, which changes in the course of collisions, the
presence of spatial inhomogeneities, and non-equilibrium
properties of the system.
The dynamics of any spreading process such as an epidemic is determined by individual peculiarities of people
in a selected social group, by the type and mechanism of
infection, etc. It can also be aﬀected by the ways the process is controlled and inﬂuenced. A dramatic example is
the spread of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus), when
diﬀerent countries and governments resorted to diﬀerent
control strategies and quarantine measures [33, 34]. Such
measures can be controlled by the choice of certain parameters accessible to society (e.g., working day duration,
average density of people in public places, frequency of
disinfection, intensity of transport communications, etc.).
The problem of strategy selection reduces to problems of
optimal control theory for feedback systems [35–37] or to
the theory of games in a more general case [38].
On the other hand, kinetic coeﬃcients or probabilities
are not the proper control parameters that are readily
available, and they can only be estimated indirectly in
terms of other parameters. For example, the recovery
rate is generally determined by the quality of provision
with medical services and food, apart from the individual peculiarities of the given member of population (see,
February 15, 2021

e.g., Refs. [39–44]). The quickest recovery depends on the
cost of medical services and the bare subsistence level of
consumption E, as well as on the availability of collective economic resource ρ. Since the cost of services is
ﬁxed, the service is terminated if there is no suﬃcient
resource (ρ ≪ E). In other words, the parameter E
serves as the height of some energy barrier peculiar to
the given system. Therefore, the recovery rate can be
supposed to have an activation-type (Arrhenius-like) dependence, ∝ exp(−E/ρ), similar to the temperature dependence of common activation processes with activation
energy E [45, 46].
In this case, the economic resource ρ formally plays the
role of eﬀective market temperature and the minimum
level of resource consumption is associated with activation
energy E [47]. This observation follows from the fact the
eﬀective market temperature can be associated with the
average amount of money or average income per individual (or economic agent) and the equilibrium distribution
of income or money for single economic agents is governed
by the exponential Boltzmann law (at least for low and
middle income classes) [48–51].
The activation process implies that the system can exhibit the so-called explosive (or catastrophic) instability
[52]. For example, when a chemical reaction occurs with
the release of heat and has an activation character, it goes
faster at higher temperatures. This leads to yet greater
temperature increase and ultimately to a thermal explosion, which is described in the framework of the Zel’dovichFrank-Kamenetskii theory [53–55].
The ﬁght against the epidemic involves similar catastrophic processes. The spread of epidemic and the associated quarantine measures result in the reduction of the
collective resource ρ. When the resource is depleted, the
quality of medical services drops and the recovery rate
goes down. As a result, the number of active members in
population decreases. This, in turn, leads to a further reduction of the collective resource, with the level of income
needed for the basic survival being lower and lower. Such
a scenario can ﬁnally result in the ultimate collapse of the
system—the eﬀect opposite to thermal explosion [47].
In this paper, we address some of the points mentioned
above. In other words, we are interested not only in modeling the spread of epidemic as an example of a spreading
process but also in identifying the ways it can be controlled
by socially available parameters and which consequences
such control measures can lead to. To demonstrate a number of possible eﬀects, we turn to a quite simple dynamical
feedback model. This model has the following two important features.
(I) To take into account the fact that an individual can
stay in diﬀerent environments or public places (e.g., transport, shop, work) characterized by diﬀerent densities of
surrounding individuals, it is convenient to consider some
social group and its average daily cycle (T ). For instance,
we can introduce the average daily time spans for which
the individual stays at home (T1 ), at shop or other pub-

lic places (T2 ), in transport (T3 ), at work (T4 ), etc. and
deﬁne (at least under normal conditions) the characteristic density cj of individuals or the average distance ℓj
between them in each of the locations j. We also make
a qualitative assessment of the dependence of the transmission rate on the density of individuals or average distance between them in order to clearly identify the set
of control parameters {Tj , ℓj }. Finally, we take into consideration a possibility of indirect transmission through
the medium (e.g., contaminated water [56, 57]) or via the
so-called fomites [58, 59]. The indirect transmission rate
depends on the same set of control parameters {Tj , ℓj }.
(II) The interplay between the epidemic and the economic resource available for the selected social group is
taken into account by means of the activation-type dependence of characteristic recovery rates. To this end, we use
the simplest form of the equation for the dynamics of the
collective resource ρ.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we
estimate the direct and indirect transmission rates of contagion in terms of basic social control parameters such
as the average distance between the individuals and the
average time spent in a certain location. In Section 3,
we consider an extended suspected-infected-quarantinerecovered (SIR/SIQR) model that takes into consideration
the above-discussed points (I) and (II). In Section 4, we
provide several examples of numerical modeling. In particular, we demonstrate the eﬀect of indirect transmission,
the eﬀect of quarantine measures, and the eﬀect of limited
resource. Conclusions are drawn in Section 5.
2. Direct and indirect transmission rates
As mentioned above, the spread of contagion such as infection can be controlled only by the parameters accessible
to society. For example, the average distance ℓj between
the individuals and the average time Tj spent in a certain
location j can be such control parameters. Here we estimate the infection transmission rates in terms of these
parameters in the case of direct transmission (infected-tosusceptible) and indirect transmission (through the environment).
2.1. Direct transmission
It can naturally be assumed that the probability of being
infected, which generally depends on the distance between
the infected and susceptible individuals, is described by a
damped function with a characteristic correlation radius
ℓc (decay length). For simplicity, we suppose that the susceptible individual and the infected individual can interact
only when they fall into the vicinity of radius ℓc with each
other and that the probability of elementary transmission
per unit time in this case does not depend on distance and
equals ω. We also assume that for any susceptible individual the transmissions from two diﬀerent infected individuals are independent events. Note that in our simpliﬁed

Let us assume that each individual can stay in Nω diﬀerent locations during some typical period T (e.g., one day).
Each location is characterized by its own average distance
ℓj . Then the integral transmission rate β for all locations
is given by the following formula:

consideration the correlation radius ℓc can be associated
with a socially safe distance.
Next we suppose that for each social location j the average population density cj is not aﬀected by any social
conditions and is solely determined
√ by the average distance between individuals, cj ≈ ( πℓj )−2 . The average
number of individuals falling into the circle of radius ℓc
around the susceptible individual in each of the locations
j is N j ≈ cj πℓ2c . Then the probability for the susceptible
individual to be infected over time interval ∆t can be estimated as ∆Pj = ωκ(Nj − 1)∆t. Here κ ≈ i = I/N is the
probability that the given individual in the vicinity of the
susceptible individual is infected, N being the total number of individuals, I being the total number of infected
individuals, and i being the number density of infected individuals. Summing over all the susceptible individuals S,
we obtain an increment of the number of infected individuals, ∆I = S∆Pj . Dividing by the total population N
and the time interval ∆t, we get a characteristic growth
rate of the number density of infected individuals:

The probability ω of elementary transmission per unit

distance ℓ0 between two individuals (the so-called close
contact distance). Assume that the suspected individual
is infected with probability equal to unity if he stays at the
distance ℓ0 from the infected individual for some characteristic time τis . Then the probability of becoming infected

As an example, consider four diﬀerent social locations
(Nω = 4). Location 1 refers to staying at home (limited
social contacts), location 2 refers to shopping and other
social contacts during a day, location 3 refers to staying
in public transport (where the transmission probability is
the highest), location 4 refers to staying at work. Table 1
gives the transmission rates ωj and β calculated for various sets of social control parameters Tj and ℓj . We considered three possible scenarios: casual (no restrictions), soft
quarantine (social distancing in place), and strict quarantine (restricted public transport, limited social contacts,
partial cutting of economic activity). The soft quarantine
measures reduce the integral transmission rate β by a factor of 3, and the strict quarantine measures reduce it by a
factor of 7. It can be seen that our rough estimates given
by formulas (2) and (3) allow the transmission rates to be
controlled by the proper choice of parameters Tj and ℓj in
diﬀerent social scenarios. Our β estimates in the case of casual scenario fall in the range (≈ 0.6 T −1) derived from the
statistical data for the COVID-19 epidemic in the Wuhan
city [60].
Note that the ωj estimate given by formula (2) is very
rough. In fact, the transmission rate depends on ﬂuctuations in the number of individuals falling into the circle
of radius ℓc . The maximum number Nm of individuals
that can fall into the circle of radius ℓc is determined by
the closest packing of the region r < ℓc by hard spheres
with radius equal to the the minimum possible distance
ℓ0 between two individuals. For example, considering a
triangular lattice with lattice constant ℓ0 , we have

Let ϑ be the probability that the lattice node is occupied.
Then the average number of individuals falling into the
region r < ℓc is N = ϑNm , and its mean-square ﬂuctuation
is estimated as

when they need to stay isolated either at home or at hospital getting a medical help. Such individuals are referred to
as quarantined individuals (Q). The quarantined individuals either recover (with or without the acquired immunity)
or die. The corresponding mathematical model is given by
the following system of ODEs:

It should also be noted that the characteristic scattering

where the operator ∂t stands for the derivative with respect
to time t. The functions s(t), i(t), q(t), and r(t) describe
the number densities of the susceptible, infected, quarantined, and recovered compartments, respectively. Here
the index j = 1, . . . , Nω runs through all the social locations, and Nω is the total number of such locations taken
into consideration (see Section 2). The direct transmission rates ωj in each of the locations j are deﬁned by formula (2). The characteristic daily time spans Tj in each of
the locations j are given in Table 1, the total time spent
in all the locations being constant each day and equal to
the day duration T [see formula (4)].
Each of the functions dj (t) describes the pathogen density per individual in the cloud j and contributes to the
indirect transmission of the infection from the cloud to susceptible individuals. The pathogen dynamics in the cloud
j is given by the following equation:

2.2. Indirect transmission
In addition to the direct transmission of infection by
direct contact of susceptible individuals with infected individuals, the infection caused by a pathogen (e.g., virus)
can be transmitted indirectly either through the medium
(e.g., contaminated water [56, 57]) or via intermediate objects (like hands, counters, doorknobs, etc.) often called
fomites [58, 59]. Such an intermediate medium or fomites
will further be referred to as “cloud”. We associate a separate cloud with each social location j.
Let dj be the pathogen density per individual in the
cloud j. Then a characteristic growth rate of the number
density of infected individuals attributed to the indirect
transmission of the infection from the cloud j to susceptible individuals can be calculated in the same way as in
the case of direct transmission, namely
∆i
≈ Ωj dj s.

∂t dj = σj i − γj dj .

(6e)

The ﬁrst term, σj i, describes the pathogen shedding by
the infected individuals into the cloud, and the second
term, γj dj , describes the pathogen decay in the cloud due
to natural inactivation, decontamination, or other routes.
The function ρ(t) represents the average resource associated with the average amount of money or income per
individual in the selected social group. The resource balance equation is written as follows [47]

(5)

Here the parameter Ωj describes the typical (indirect) rate
of pathogen transmission from the cloud j to a susceptible
individual. The estimates of indirect transmission rates for
various sets of control parameters Tj and ℓj are provided
in Appendix A.

∂t ρ = G(s + i + r) − Γρ ρ + Λ.

(6f)

The acquisition of this resource per unit time is proportional to the number density of working (active) individuals (the quarantined individuals are assumed to be
not working). The parameter G formalizes the resource
amount acquired by them per unit time. In line with
Ref. [65], we refer to this parameter as acquisition rate. It
is proportional to the average working time T4 for the given
social group (see Table 1). The second term, Γρ ρ, formally describes the collective expenses or taxes. Roughly
speaking, the expenses are assumed to be proportional to
earnings. Thus, the coeﬃcient Γρ represents the resource
consumption rate. The parameter Λ represents a resource

3. Dynamical model
3.1. Mathematical formulation
We subdivide the selected social group into ﬁve compartments: susceptible (S), infected (I), quarantined (Q), recovered (R), and deceased (F). Susceptible individuals (S)
are those who are at risk to be infected. Infected individuals (I) are those who have been infected and pass
through the virus incubation period. Then they either recover (with or without the acquired immunity) or pass to
the severe form of decease (like fever or organ disfunction)

source (constant resource inﬂow into the system from some
external reservoir) or a resource sink (constant resource
outﬂow from the system). When Λ > 0, resource is fed
into the system (e.g., in the form of subsidies) from some
external source, e.g., a central bank or central government.
When Λ < 0, resource ﬂows out from the system, e.g., in
the form of infrastructure expenses, depreciation, rent, interest payments, or other ﬁxed expenses.
The recovery process is governed by the general economic situation characterized by a certain minimum level
of resource consumption E, which reﬂects the cost of medical and other essential life services. It deﬁnes the minimum amount of the consumed resource needed for the
recovery of individuals in the selected social group, therefore implying the existence of some “energy” barrier for
their recovery. The recovery rates, i.e., the coeﬃcients
at the function q(t) in Eqs. (6a) and (6d), are supposed
to have an activation-type (Arrhenius-like) dependence,
∝ exp(−E/ρ), similar to the temperature dependence of
common activation processes with activation energy E.

The full description and indicative values of the parameters of Eqs. (6) are given in Table A.1 (see Appendix A).
Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram that depicts transitions between diﬀerent compartments and identiﬁes the
corresponding transition rates.
In particular, the parameter Γis describes a rate at
which the infected individuals recover without acquiring
the immunity and come back to the susceptible compartment. The parameter Γiq describes a rate at which the
infected individuals develop a severe condition and pass
to the quarantine compartment, where they become isolated either at home or at hospital. The parameter Γir
describes a rate at which the infected individuals recover

Eﬀectively, our model is a combination or extension of SIR-like (susceptible-infected-recovered) epidemic
models such as SIQR (susceptible-infected-quarantinedrecovered) [66], SIWR/SIVR/SIRP (susceptible-infectedrecovered-pathogen) [56, 67–69], SIRD (susceptibleinfected-recovered-deceased) [70, 71], and EITS (environmental infection transmission system) [58].

The parameters Γqr and Γqs describe the rates at which
the quarantined individuals recover with or without the
acquired immunity. The parameter Γqf describes the fatality rate in the case of unlimited resource (E ≪ ρ). In
this case, the quarantined individuals all get the necessary medical care and the fatalities are only attributed to
insuperable health complications (such as concomitant diseases or age factor). In the opposite case, when E ≫ ρ (no
resource to ﬁght against the epidemic), the fatality rate is
at its maximum and is equal to the rate constant

for the quarantined individuals. Here τq is the mean quarantine/hospitalization period. This case refers to the full
collapse of the medical system when the quarantined individuals get no medical help or treatment.
Each of the parameters Ωj describes the typical rate
of pathogen transmission from the cloud j to susceptible
individuals. Two other cloud-related parameters, σj and
γj , are the pathogen shedding rate (infected-to-cloud) and
decay rate in the cloud, respectively. Their estimates are
provided in Appendix A.
Note that the instantaneous number density of quarantined (ill) individuals q(t) is not often a convenient indicator for practical applications. The integral number density
of quarantined individuals for a certain period of time can
be used instead. It is calculated as follows

In general, the basic reproduction number R0 deﬁnes
the average number of transmissions one infected individual makes in the entire susceptible compartment during
the entire time of being infected. When R0 6 1, the
disease-free equilibrium is stable, and there is no epidemic
outbreak. When R0 > 1, the disease-free equilibrium is
unstable, and the system evolves to the state of endemic
equilibrium.
The ﬁrst two equations of system (12) are strongly nonlinear. There are no analytical solutions known for the
general form of these equations. However, in one particular case, when Γis = Γqs = 0 (µ = 1, no loss of immunity)

4. Examples
Now we consider particular examples to demonstrate
various eﬀects described by our model. First we focus
on the case when there is no resource depletion (ρ ≫ E),
so that the resource activation barrier could be ignored
(E = 0). We illustrate the “patient zero” phenomenon,
demonstrate the eﬀect of indirect transmission, and model
a quarantine scenario. Next we consider an example of a
social group with limited resource (E 6= 0).

The number density of infected individuals exhibits a typical peak and then drops. The peak has the same height
for the both initial densities, but in the case of larger i0 it
is reached much faster (see Table 2). This example serves
as an illustration of the “patient zero” phenomenon. When
R0 > 1, the epidemic spreads even when it starts only from
one infected individual (patient zero). Then it reaches the
same intensity in a certain period of time, which is shorter
when the initial number of infected individuals is larger.
This eﬀect is also clearly seen in the phase portraits i(s)
at diﬀerent i0 (Fig. 3).

4.1. Effect of i0
Figure 2a shows the number densities of susceptible, infected, quarantined, and recovered individuals as functions
of time in the case of two diﬀerent initial number densities
of infected individuals i0 for the ﬁxed basic reproduction
number (R0 = 2.5). The case i0 = 10−7 corresponds to an
initial density of one per 10 million, and the case i0 = 10−5
corresponds to an initial density of one per 100 thousand.

4.2. Effect of indirect transmission
Figure 2 shows the number densities of susceptible, infected, quarantine, and recovered individuals in the cases
when there is no indirect transmission [panel (a)] and
when there is such a transmission [panels (b,c)]. The
7

1

model parameters were selected according to Table A.1
(see Appendix A). The inclusion of the cloud increased
the basic reproduction number R0 , so that the peaks of
infected (imax ) and quarantine (qmax ) densities might become larger and shift to shorter times (Table 2).

4.3. Quarantine scenario

The epidemic dynamics is governed by the basic reproduction number R0 . The epidemic starts to spread when
R0 > 1. The greater R0 , the larger are imax , qmax , and
(qΣ )∞ . Thus, to reduce the epidemic peak and to slow
the epidemic down, one should reduce R0 . According to
formula (17), this can be achieved by reducing the transmission rates ωj and, therefore, the integral transmission
rate β. Such measures are usually referred to as quarantine. To model the quarantine scenario, we assumed the
following form of the transmission rates:

Figure 4: Number densities of susceptible, infected, quarantined,
and recovered individuals in the case of quarantine scenario with
t1 = 20 T , t2 = 60 T , β(0) = 0.5 T −1 , βp (0) = 0.2 T −1 (R0 = 3.5)
and β ′ = 0.18 T −1 , βp′ = 0.04 T −1 (R0 = 1.1).

Our results are in line with the results of modeling presented in Ref. [33]. The greater the reduction in transmission, the longer and ﬂatter is the epidemic curve, with
the risk of resurgence when interventions are lifted to mitigate economic impact. The similar results were obtained
when modeling the COVID-19 quarantine scenario for the
Wuhan city, with a stochastic SEIR model ﬁtted to the
available statistical data [73]. The pre-quarantine R0 value
equal to 2.35 (the median estimate) dropped to R0 ≈ 1.05
after the start of the quarantine.

where t1 is the moment when the quarantine starts, t2
is the moment when the quarantine ends, β(0) and βp (0)
are the direct and indirect transmission rates during the
period when there is no quarantine, and β ′ and βp′ are the
transmission rates during the quarantine period.
Figure 4 demonstrates an example of the quarantine scenario when the initial basic reproduction number R0 = 3.5
was reduced to R0 = 1.1 by quarantine measures at the
moment t1 = 20 days. In particular, this can be achieved
by increasing the average distance ℓj between the individuals in transport and other social locations and by reducing the average time Tj spent in these locations (see
Table 1 in Sect. 2). The number density of quarantine
individuals continued to grow during the quarantine period but at much lesser rate and acquired a local peak
at t ≈ 48 days. Then the quarantine was terminated at
the moment t2 = 60 days. The number densities of the
infected and quarantined individuals immediately started
to grow again and reached the new peaks that were much
larger than those during the quarantine (row 5 in Table 2).
As compared to the “no quarantine” scenario (Fig. 2b,
row 3 in Table 2), the absolute heights of the peaks decreased, but the integral number densities of quarantine
individuals qΣ and, therefore, fatal cases remained nearly
the same. Thus, the quarantine scenario allows one to win
time but does not seriously aﬀect the total number of ill
and deceased people by the end of epidemic, in the case
when the mortality rate remains to be constant.
The second (post-quarantine) peak in the number densities of infected and quarantined individuals clearly illustrates the eﬀect known as the second wave of the epidemic, which has in particular been observed in the case
of COVID-19 epidemic in many countries [72].

4.4. Effect of limited resource
Here we demonstrate the eﬀect of nonzero resource activation parameter E. Let us rewrite resource equation (6f)
in terms of dimensionless resource ̺ = ρ/ρ(0) ,
∂t ̺ =


Γρ
k(s + i + r) − (1 + sΛ ) ̺ + sΛ ,
1 + sΛ

(21)

where ρ(0) = (G(0) + Λ)/Γρ is the equilibrium resource
value when there is no epidemic (so that ̺(0) ≡ 1),
sΛ = Λ/G(0) is the number density of active individuals that would have to be working to acquire the resource
amount equal to |Λ| (per unit time), k = G/G(0) 6 1 is
the time-dependent coeﬃcient that allows for variations
in the resource acquisition rate during the spread of the
epidemic, and G(0) is the resource acquisition rate when
there is no epidemic and the system is in equilibrium. For
the sake of simplicity, we will limit our consideration to
the case sΛ = 0.
Resource equation (21) is coupled to Eqs. (12), where
the exponential factor exp(−E/ρ) needs to be identically
rewritten as exp(−E/̺). The parameter E ≡ E/ρ(0) is the
resource activation level E normalized to the equilibrium
resource value. Nonzero E reduces the recovery rates of
quarantine individuals, Γqr exp(−E/̺) and Γqs exp(−E/̺),
so that there would be more fatal cases as compared to the
case of unlimited resource (E = 0).
Figure 5 demonstrates the eﬀect of limited resource in
the case of E = 0.1, with all other parameters selected

Figure 6: Eﬀect of two diﬀerent quarantine scenarios on the number
density of fatal cases f in the case of limited resource (E = 0.1). The
model parameters for the quarantine scenarios (see Table 1) with
t1 = 20 T and t2 = 60 T are β(0) = 0.5 T −1 , βp (0) = 0.2 T −1 (no
quarantine, R0 = 3.5); β ′ = 0.18 T −1 , βp′ = 0.04 T −1 (soft quarantine, R′0 = 1.1); β ′ = 0.07 T −1 , βp′ = 0.02 T −1 (strict quarantine,
R′0 = 0.45).

antine, the transmission rate β goes down (Table 1), the
basic reproduction number R0 becoming smaller and the
epidemic spreading being less intensive. The soft quarantine scenario does not aﬀect the average number of working
hours per working individual, and the resource acquisition
rate G remains the same as in the case of no quarantine
(k = 1). The number of fatal cases grows much slower
during the quarantine, but it gradually goes back towards
its value in the case of no quarantine after the quarantine
is terminated.
In the case of strict quarantine, the transmission rate β
is yet smaller (Table 1), mainly because this quarantine
scenario also aﬀects the total number of working hours,
which is twice as small as compared to the case of soft
quarantine. As a result, the resource acquisition rate goes
down (k = 0.5) during the quarantine. In the short run,
the number of fatal cases in the case of such strict quarantine measures substantially declines as compared to the
cases of soft quarantine and no quarantine (Fig. 6). However, it starts to rapidly increase after the quarantine is
terminated and eventually becomes larger than it was in
the case of no quarantine. This example demonstrates that
strict quarantine measures that aﬀect the general economic
situation may have serious negative social outcomes in the
case of limited economic resource.

Figure 5: Eﬀect of limited resource ̺ = ρ/ρ(0) on the number density
of fatal cases f in the case of E = E/ρ(0) = 0.1. The number
density of quarantined individuals q is the same in the cases of limited
(E = 0.1) and unlimited (E = 0) resource. The model parameters
are the same as in the example shown in Fig. 2b.

such as in the example shown in Fig. 2b. Nonzero E has
a profound eﬀect on the number of fatal cases, which is
nearly 6 times larger than in the case of unlimited resource
(Fig. 5a). Such a manyfold increase in the number of fatal
cases is caused only by a 5% drop of resource ̺ (Fig. 5b).
Resource began to decline as the number of quarantined
individuals grew up (Fig. 5a), since the quarantined individuals are supposed to be passive and not acquiring
the resource [see Eq. (21)]. After the number of quarantined individuals passed through its peak, resource passed
through its minimum and started to increase towards its
initial value. This example illustrates a scenario when the
economic subsystem has a limited capacity to support the
medical infrastructure, so that seriously ill (quarantined)
individuals could not get the necessary medical help to
overcome the infection.
The resource acquisition rate G was assumed to be constant (k ≡ 1) in the above example. The parameter G
is determined by the average number of working hours
per working individual and by the working eﬃciency. The
average number of working hours is proportional to the
control parameter T4 , which can be reduced in the case of
quarantine, as discussed in Sect. 2 (see Table 1). Figure 6
demonstrates the eﬀect of two diﬀerent quarantine scenarios on the number density of fatal cases. When there is no
quarantine, the number density of fatal cases is the same as
in Fig. 5a for the case of E = 0.1. In the case of soft quar-

5. Conclusion
We proposed a dynamical model for describing the
spread of epidemics. The spreading process within a selected social group is governed by the equations that explicitly take into account the dependence of characteristic
transmission rates on the local population density in various social zones. The indirect channel of transmission via
an intermediate environment or the so-called fomites was
also taken into consideration. A negative feedback between
9

the infected population size and a collective economic resource associated with the average amount of money or
income per individual was introduced to describe the socioeconomic interplay. The epidemic spread and the use
of quarantine measures was demonstrated to be connected
with economic losses, which in turn could aggravate the
negative outcomes of the epidemic.
The model presented in this work can be used to model
the COVID-19 epidemic for particular social groups and
regions. It can also be applied to describing other spreading processes, such as the spread of information, rumors,
ideas, or concepts.

cloud per one contact, and Vj is the total volume (capacity) of the cloud j. The parameter n is assumed to be
independent of the particular cloud.
Then the scaled indirect transmission rates νj can be
estimated as

χj .

νj = Ωj

The dimensionless parameter

deﬁnes the transmission eﬃciency from infected individuals to susceptible individuals through the cloud j. Although the parameter ∆ was eliminated by scaling (11),
the expression for χj still contains the parameters that are
hard to estimate from some physical principles. Therefore, this parameter can rather be estimated by ﬁtting the
model to some real statistical data. In practice, it is selected by assuming that the indirect and direct routes of
transmissions have approximately the same likelihood, i.e.
νj ≈ ωj [56].
Table A.2 gives the indirect transmission rates νj and βj
calculated by formulas (A.3) and (13) for a particular set
of social control parameters corresponding to the casual
scenario in Table A.2. The infected-to-cloud contact rates
Γij , pathogen decay rates γj , and transmission eﬃciencies
χj are assumed to be the same for each cloud and listed in
Table A.1. The cloud-to-susceptible contact rate Γjs is assumed to be inversely proportional to the squared average
distance ℓj between the individuals [as in Eq. (2)].
Table A.3 lists some estimates of the basic reproduction
number R0 derived from the statistical data on COVID-19
(literature data).

Table 1 in Sect. 2 gives the direct transmission rates
ωj and β calculated by formulas (2) and (3) for various
sets of social control parameters. Table A.1 gives the full
description of the model parameters and their estimates
used in our computations.
In particular, the cloud-related parameters can be estimated as follows. The typical (indirect) rate Ωj of
pathogen transmission from the cloud j to a susceptible
individual can roughly be estimated as
Ωj ≈ Γjs

θ,
∆

where Γjs is the average rate the susceptible individual
contacts the cloud j, υc is a typical volume of the pathogen
transferred from the cloud to the susceptible individual
per one contact, ∆ is some characteristic weight of one
pathogen specimen that can be interpreted as the minimum portion (“quant”) of the pathogen that can be transferred per one contact, and θ is the probability the transmission of this quant results in infection. The smaller the
pathogen, the smaller is the quant ∆ and the more intensive is the transmission (Ωj is higher). The parameters υc ,
∆, and θ are assumed to be independent of the particular
cloud.
The pathogen shedding rate σj (infected-to-cloud) can
roughly be estimated as
σj ≈ Γij
