Abstract
Due to delay in reporting, the daily national and statewide COVID-19 incidence
counts are often unreliable and need to be estimated from recent data. This
process is known in economics as nowcasting. We describe in this paper a
simple random forest statistical model for nowcasting the COVID - 19 daily new
infection counts based on historic data along with a set of simple covariates, such
as the currently reported infection counts, day of the week, and time since first
reporting. We apply the model to adjust the daily infection counts in Ohio,
and show that the predictions from this simple data-driven method compare
favorably both in quality and computational burden to those obtained from
the state-of-the-art hierarchical Bayesian model employing a complex statistical
algorithm.

1. Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2 virus, first observed in the United States (USA) in January
2020 [1, 2, 3], is highly contagious [4] and has spread in both urban and rural

regions [5, 6] of the USA. To gauge and combat the SARS-CoV-2 spread, governments and health organizations have set up public information systems such
as COVID-19 dashboards [7, 8, 9, 10]. These dashboards are useful to brief
the public [8] about the current state of COVID-19 in specific regions, make
data-driven public health decisions [10], and improve transparency in governance [11]. Many of these dashboards show the number of daily new infections
(daily incidence), where the infection count on a particular date refers to the
number of people who started experiencing disease symptoms on that date (i.e.,
the onset date of illness). Whereas reporting onset dates is very useful from
the viewpoint of contact tracing and disease spread monitoring, it is also challenging due to unavoidable delays. [12, 13, 7]. These delays are often due to
the time-lags between experiencing initial symptoms and seeking care, receiving
testing results, and updating the statewide records [14, 15]. As a consequence,
the incidence reporting based on onset counts leads to under-counting of the
present and most recent cases. Dashboards often explicitly warn about this
problem [16, 17]. Figure 1 shows one such example from COVID-19 Dashboard
maintained by the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) [7] where the region of
possible under-reporting is marked with a grey rectangle.
The incomplete current count data poses huge challenges for both local and
national healthcare policymakers as they strive to make difficult public health
decisions (e.g., introduce lockdowns, curfews, evaluate vaccination effects, etc)
in real time to limit the spread of the virus. The use of statistical methods to
moderate the effects of incomplete data could help reduce uncertainty in public
health decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic and increase public
awareness of the most recent disease trends.
While forecasting COVID-19 cases is typically concerned with predicting
the future burden of the epidemic, nowcasting [18, 19, 20] addresses the problem of delayed reporting and focuses on the estimation of current case counts
from not-too-distant historic data. Given the under-reported infection data for
a particular date, the nowcasting models estimate the total number of current
infections for that date, which will be reported eventually. In the literature,

Figure 1: Daywise COVID-19 cases in Ohio, as on 12-01-2020. The shaded area – comprising
of 21 days – is the preliminary case data and is likely under-reported to the ODH due to
delayed reporting.

there exist several sophisticated statistical methods for addressing the issue of
nowcasting for COVID-19. For instance, Wu et al. [21] nowcast the probable
size of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. The authors estimate the
basic reproduction number R0 from their proposed non-homogeneous counting
process modeling the exported number of international cases from Wuhan and
the global human mobility data from/to Wuhan. The authors then used the estimated R0 in the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered or SEIR model [22]
for nowcasting and forecasting the outbreak’s size. The nowcasting problem
for delayed reporting of COVID-19 cases is also addressed by Silva et al. [23]
and Greene et al. [13] using Bayesian smoothing approach [19] where the authors model the delayed number of reported cases with their proposed Markov
counting processes.
In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient machine learning model
that addresses the problem of nowcasting in a way that is easily understood
by non-experts and therefore suitable for presenting to public health decisionmakers. The only data our proposed model requires can be readily collected
from publicly available dashboards. Despite its simplicity, the model is seen
to predict, with high accuracy (measured with the typical regression-style R2
value), the number of people who start experiencing COVID-19 symptoms on a
particular date. We also show that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-

3

the-art hierarchical Bayesian model [24] in terms of nowcasting accuracy while
being also approximately 72000x faster. Our model predictions can also be
utilized as input to other forecasting models, for instance, the ones created for
ODH [25] that forecast the future number of infections and subsequent hospital
burden in Ohio.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Data processing
To perform our analysis, we used the public data available at ODH COVID19 dashboard1 , which is updated daily. It provides the daily partial incidence
count, that is, the count of all individuals itd reported on a given day t to be
confirmed COVID-19 cases with the day of onset d where d ≤ t. For our analysis
we aggregated cases by the onset date to get the state-level progression of the
onset reporting. Accordingly, the infection count IT D on a specific day T for a
given specific onset date D is given by
X

IT D =

1itd ,

(1)

d≤t≤T

where 1itd is the indicator function

1itd =



1 where t ≤ T, d = D,

(2)


0 otherwise.
Note that for a given D, IT D is non-decreasing as a function of t and, assuming that it is also bounded, it has a limit as T → ∞. This is illustrated in
Figure 2 where we see that over the course of 52 days IT D becomes approximately a constant.
We denote the asymptotic stable value of IT D for an onset date D by

of data collection as the data is backfilled, but it gradually stabilizes.

(4)

We may think about FT D as a standardized measure of undercounting that is
also robust to changes in incidence rates during the course of the pandemic. In
what follows, we therefore consider FT D in place of IT D . The plot of FT D as
a function of time T is presented in Figure 2. Note that although in general
FT D → 0 as T → ∞, we may see clearly from the plot that this convergence is
not necessarily monotone and that in the fixed time window IT D only approxis
mately stabilizes as it approaches ID
. In order to improve data stability in the

time windows of interest, we consider the IT D limit to be reached in practice as
soon as FT D < 0.05. This particular cutoff value was chosen by cross-validation
[0, 0.5], as described in Section 2.2.
In order to cross-validate and measure the prediction testing error, data to

5

be used for nowcasting is split into a training and a validation (testing) set based
on t, where all Ftd with t < Ttrain are in the former and t > Ttrain are in the
latter.
2.2. Model
Covariates. The model includes the following features to predict the Ftd .
• Days since data collection (∆). For any given infection count Itd reported
on day t with onset date d, we define this feature as
∆td = t − d.

(5)

• Day of the week (ωt ). This categorical variable denotes the day of the
week for t, at which data is being reported, ωt ∈ {Mo, Tu, We, Th, Fr,
Sa, Su}.
• Raw infection count (Itd ). This is the daily partial incidence count for the
pandemic, as described in equation 1.
Random forest regression. We train a random forest (RF) regression model [26]
on the data partition defined in section 2.1, to predict Ftd from the covariates.
Formally, we may write
Ftd = f (∆td , ∆2td , ∆3td , ωi , Itd ),

(6)

where f is the RF model.

3. Results
Goodness of fit. The explained variance (R2 value) is used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model on both the training data (time window from 10-01-2020
to 11-15-2020) and on the testing data (time window from 11-16-2020 to 12-152020). The predictions from the fitted model plotted against the true values in
test data can be seen in Figure 3. The explained variance is 0.99 on the training
data and 0.89 on the testing data, which shows that the model’s prediction of
Ftd generalizes well to the unseen data.

Importance of covariates. The relative importance of covariates (the Gini importance or the mean decrease in impurity) in the fitted model, described in
Section 2.2 can be seen in Table 1. The covariate days since data collection
(∆), along with its quadratic and cubic transforms turn out to be the most
important features in determining the fraction of missing data Ftd . The day of
the week ωi has much less relative importance.
Prediction of missingness Ftd . Figure 4 shows the prediction of Ftd for different
values of ∆td . As seen from the plot, the model predictions are close to the true
Ftd when ∆ > 4. The good agreement at ∆ = 0 is trivial, as at first date of
collection, Ftd is almost always close to 1.0 and thus easy to predict. It is also
evident that first 3-4 days of data collection seem to be unreliable in predicting

Actual count prediction. Based on the prediction of Ftd and the current observed
count Itd , we use (4), to get the estimate of Ids , which is the stable value of the
infection count on day d. The typical trends for 4 different days of the week
can be seen in Figure 5. The infection count from the model predicts the stable
value Ids robustly after five days (starting from ∆ = 5), and in some cases
even earlier. In Figure 5 we may see that irrespective of the day of the week
(Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday), the model is seen to predict the value
of Ids with good accuracy. We may also note that on Monday and Sunday the
model predictions have higher uncertainty likely due to the effect of weekend
test processing slowdown.
Comparison with the Bayesian model. In order to provide some context for
assessing the quality of the RF model predictions, we compare our results with
a state-of-the-art hierarchical Bayesian model proposed recently by Kline et al.
[24], which has been used for the same purpose of nowcasting COVID-19 cases
in the state of Ohio. The model, which we refer to as the Bayesian model (BM)
in the following, is more elaborate than ours as it has also a spatial component.
Specifically, it keeps track of COVID-19 cases over time in different geographical
regions (counties in Ohio). Although in our comparison we aggregate BM spatial
counts, for the sake of completeness we briefly describe here the entire model

along with its spatial component. Denoting by Yi,t the true count of cases in
county i with onset date t the BM assumes the following Poisson model for the
dynamics of the disease:
Yi,t ∼ Poisson (exp (Oi + αi,t + Xt ηi )) ,

(7)

where Oi is an offset of the logarithm of population of county i, the spatiotemporal random variables αi,t are the latent states of the process, the design
vector Xt indicates the day of the week, and the vector ηi captures the day of
the week effect. It is assumed that Yi,t is only partially observed for time t >
Tmax −D, where Tmax stands for the last onset date and D (assumed 30 in [24]) is
the maximum reporting delay following onset. BM also uses a semi-local linear
trend model [27] for the spatio-temporal random variables αi,t . Further, the
spatial correlation is accounted for using an intrinsic conditional auto-regressive
model. The reporting delay is described by a Multinomial-Dirichlet model as
follows. Denoting by Zi,t,d the count of cases in county i with onset date t,

which are observed d days after t, one defines Zi,t = (Zi,t,0 , Zi,t,1 , . . . , Zi,t,D ).
Then, the Multinomial-Dirichlet model prescribes
Zi,t ∼ Multinomial (pi,t , Yi,t ) ,
pi,t ∼ GeneralizedDirichlet (ai,t , bi,t ) ,
where the vectors ai,t and bi,t are described in terms of mean and dispersion
parameters [28]. The choice of a Generalized Dirichlet distribution allows for
modeling potential overdispersion in pi,t (see [28]). Moreover, it leads to a convenient Beta-Binomial conditional distribution representation for the components Zi,t,d . For the purpose of Bayesian analysis, the authors specify normally
distributed priors for the parameters and use the R package nimble to perform
a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. The authors report a run
time of approximately 20 hours for 30, 000 iterations.
To compare the two models, we calculate the L2 distance between the predictions made by the RF and the Bayesian model, respectively and the actual
known stable values in the Ohio COVID-19 daily counts dataset. We report
the ratio of the two L2 distance values as a measure of relative closeness of the
models to the true (stable) data value for days T − 10 to T and T − 10 to T − 5,
where T is the last available date in the data. The results are presented in Table 2. As can be seen in the table, the predictions by the random forest model
are relatively closer to the true values than those generated using the Bayesian
model estimates. The ratio is smaller in the full 10 day window, indicating that
the RF model makes better predictions than BM for days that are close to data
collection.

4. Summary and Discussion
We presented here a simple method for nowcasting COVID-19 cases from
historic data on daily incidence of new cases, as measured by the onset of symptoms. Such type of data is now widely available for all states in the USA as well
as for most countries in the world. When the need to take immediate decisions
on governance or policy arises, nowcasting can be a useful tool in providing
more accurate estimates about disease incidence and spread. Specifically, our
proposed nowcasting algorithm uses a random forest (RF) regression methodology and leverages covariates that are based on day of the week, the number
of days passed since first data collection and total incidence so far.
The proposed algorithm is both conceptually simple and computationally
efficient. Our results also suggest that it compares favorably with a much more
elaborate Bayesian model. We have illustrated the application of our approach
on publicly available data from COVID-19 daily onsets in Ohio, as available from
the state’s COVID-19 interactive dashboard. We observed that the model is able
to predict the final incidence for a day, within 3 to 4 days of data collection.
We also find that the number of days passed since first data collection, along
with its transformations (or derivatives), are the most important covariates in
predicting the final incidence.
In order to make our RF method predictions broadly available to interested
researchers and practitioners, we have created a publicly available and accessible
interactive notebook (see below). As described in the repository, the notebook
allows one to use our algorithm to nowcast current COVID-19 onset occurrences,
based on any user-provided historic data supplied in appropriate format.
The problem of nowcasting historic data is an important one, specially during
the current COVID-19 pandemic, when delays in reporting can snowball into
sub-optimal policies and actions, that can cost lives and create unnecessary
societal burden. Our proposed method allows both general public and health
providers to carefully monitor the pandemic trends and make informed decisions.
The ideas we presented while focused on COVID-19 can be broadly applicable

12

to similar public health problems in the future.
