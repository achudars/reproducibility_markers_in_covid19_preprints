Abstract
Public transit is central to cultivating equitable communities. Meanwhile, the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19
and associated social restrictions has radically transformed
ridership behavior in urban areas. Perhaps the most concerning aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic is that low-income
and historically marginalized groups are not only the most
susceptible to economic shifts but are also most reliant on
public transportation. As revenue decreases, transit agencies
are tasked with providing adequate public transportation services in an increasingly hostile economic environment. Transit
agencies therefore have two primary concerns. First, how has
COVID-19 impacted ridership and what is the new postCOVID normal? Second, how has ridership varied spatiotemporally and between socio-economic groups? In this work
we provide a data-driven analysis of COVID-19’s affect on
public transit operations and identify temporal variation in
ridership change. We then combine spatial distributions of
ridership decline with local economic data to identify variation
between socio-economic groups. We find that in Nashville and
Chattanooga, TN, fixed-line bus ridership dropped by 66.9%
and 65.1% from 2019 baselines before stabilizing at 48.4%
and 42.8% declines respectively. The largest declines were
during morning and evening commute time. Additionally, there
was a significant difference in ridership decline between the
highest-income areas and lowest-income areas (77% vs 58%)
in Nashville.

I. Introduction
The novel coronavirus COVID-19 and the associated social
restrictions have radically transformed travel behavior in urban
areas throughout the world. While COVID-19 has transformed
normal operations in almost all industries, the social distancing
measures and precautions associated with this virus have had
particularly devastating effects on public transit. For instance,
since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [1] subway ridership in New
York City has dropped by upwards of 91% [2]. This disruption
has created pressing operational challenges for public transit
agencies.

Foremost, agencies must determine how to continue providing adequate service while navigating a rapidly changing environment with reduced resources. This involves first
quantifying the affects of the pandemic to date. However,
the decentralized nature of government policies and recommendations in the United States makes it challenging to
identify global solutions for local transit agencies. Therefore
local agencies must identify solutions tailored to their unique
circumstances. Additionally, the local outlook is dynamic as
regulations are lifted or restricted over time. Therefore careful
data-driven modeling and analysis is required to stay up-todate on local ridership behavior as well as the financial effects
going forward.
Perhaps the most concerning aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic is that low-income and historically marginalized groups
are not only the most likely to be affected financially by the
crisis but are also the least likely to own their own cars [3].
Therefore most rely on the public transit system to get to work,
school or access child services. Additionally, as most people
working in grocery stores, logistics and cleaning have been
labeled “essential services,” many people from low-income
groups do not have the luxury of working remotely from home.
As resources are limited by drastic drops in ridership, agencies
must take care in identifying trips to be cut so as to not hurt
those most reliant on local transit services.
This work is primarily concerned with two questions. First,
to what degree has the COVID-19 pandemic and associated
state restrictions affected ridership and operations of fixedline public transit? We focus on Nashville and Chattanooga,
TN. We present total lost riders over time compared to 2019
baselines and provide a spatio-temporal analysis of ridership
decline throughout both cities. Secondly, are there disparities
in ridership changes across socio-economic groups? For this
we provide a spatial analysis of ridership patterns throughout
the COVID-19 pandemic and correlate our findings with publicly available economic data to draw conclusions regarding
changes in behavior between socio-economic groups.
II. Contributions and Key Findings
The primary contributions of this work are as follows:
1) We provide a summary of ridership changes due to
COVID-19 in Nashville and Chattanooga, TN. We find
that ridership dropped by up to 66.9% and 65.1% in

Nashville and Chattanooga respectively by late April
before starting a moderate recovery.
2) We performed a temporal investigation of ridership pre
and post-COVID-19 and find that an out-sized proportion of changes in ridership occur during weekdays
during morning and evening rush, indicating that Stay at
Home orders and remote work options are a significant
factor in ridership declines.
3) Our spatial analysis indicates that change in ridership
varies greatly between census tracts and neighborhoods.
By incorporating economic data at the census tract level
we found that ridership declined up to 19% more in
high-income neighborhoods than in the lowest income
parts of Nashville.
The remainder of this article is as follows. First, we summarize recent literature regarding the impact of COVID-19 on
public transit systems and socio-economic transportation studies in Section III. Then we describe the data and processing
methods in Section IV. In Section V, we outline our analysis
methods and results. We address possible limitations of this
work in Section VI and finally we summarize our findings and
discuss future work in Section VII.
III. Related Work
In this section we cover literature related to COVID-19 in
the context of transportation systems and the interaction of
socio-economics on transit usage.
A. COVID-19 and transportation
Fixed-line bus and rail public transit inherently involves
moving passengers in an enclosed space. One of the major
reasons there has been such significant declines in public
transit ridership is the fear of COVID-19. In public health
fields, the study of infectious disease transmission through
public transit and air travel is well studied [4], [5], [6], [7].
While there is a growing number of publications regarding
the spread of COVID-19 by air travel [8], there is a lack
of information on how this applies to public transit [9].
Regardless of transmission rates on public transit ridership has
declined significantly as we show in this work.
Given how fast COVID-19 has transformed life in urban
areas the limited amount of work related to virus in the
context of public transit ridership mostly consists of pre-print
publications and government public releases. The Connected
Cities With Smart Transportation (C2SMART) group at New
York University has released monthly whitepapers related to
the impacts of COVID-19 on New York City and Seattle. They
find that in New York City, average subway and commuter rail
ridership is down 80% while bus ridership is down 50% in the
first week of July, 2020 with a peak subway ridership decline
of 94% in late March [2, 10, 11, 12]. There are similar findings
in European cities [13].
There has been some recent work investigating mode shift
away from public transit. While modeling lasting effects of the
pandemic is in its early stages, in some high transit cities even
moderate shifts from public transit to personal vehicles can

increase travel times by 5 to 10 minutes on average for one
way trips [14]. On the other hand, in New York City the bike
sharing program CitiBike has been more resilient to loss in
ridership than the subway system and there is some evidence
of transit users shifting to the shared bike programs [15].
B. Socio-economics in transportation
Previous research indicates different transit behaviors among
socioeconomic classes. When it comes to public transit, lowincome and historically marginalized groups are particularly
reliant on public transportation. Minorities and low-income
households account for 63% of transit riders in the United
States [16]. Additionally, low-income groups are more likely
to ride buses while high income individuals are more likely
to utilize rail systems [17]. According to a 2017 publication
from the American Public Transportation Association, 30%
of bus riders have a household income of less than $15,000,
while 12% of bus riders have a household income of $100,000
or more. Among rail riders, only 13% have household incomes below $15,000, while 29% have household incomes
of $100,000 or more [18]. In terms of public versus private
transit, a study conducted in Hawaii reported key differences
between bus riders and solo drivers. The mean household
income of a bus rider was 16% lower than that of a solo
driver [19]. Bus riders also, on average, owned fewer cars per
household (1.7 cars) compared to solo drivers (2.3 cars) [19].
A major reason low-income groups are heavily reliant on
public transportation is their likelihood of owning a personal
vehicle. According to an analysis of 2012 California Household Travel Survey data, 78% of households without a car do
not have a car as a result of economic or physical barriers [3].
Together, these studies suggest that individuals of a lower socioeconomic background may be disproportionately impacted
by changes in public transit availability. It is important to note
that these trends are not unique to the United States; a case
study conducted in France found that low income individuals
comprised a larger portion of public transit ridership than high
income individuals [20].
IV. Data Collection and Processing
In this section we outline the datasets used in this work
which consist of ridership boarding information, economic
data per census tract and COVID-19 cases per day as well
as data processing and filtering.
A. Ridership data
Boarding count data was provided by the Metropolitan
Government of Nashville and Davidson Count for the fixedline bus systems of Nashville from January 1, 2019 to July
1, 2020. Boarding information was also acquired from the
Chattanooga Area Regional Transportation Agency (CARTA)
between January 1, 2020 to July 1, 2020. The ridership data
was derived from farebox units on all passenger vehicles
servicing trips within these time ranges. Farebox included a
record of reach passenger boarding event. It also included
driver information, shift changes and when vehicles switch

where that boarding occurred. As each census tract included
a geometric polygon representing the tract this was a simple
spatial join. One limitation of working with aggregated 2019
data for Chattanooga was that we could not get baseline
ridership information at the census tract level. For Nashville
baseline 2019 ridership at the census level was available.

V. Analysis and Results

161

82

In this section we outline the main analysis and results
for this work. We start by giving a high level overview
of COVID-19 restrictions and the corresponding operational
changes implemented by the transit agencies in Nashville
and Chattanooga before moving into our analysis of ridership
declines in both cities.

routes. This information was filtered so that only boarding
events remained. In 2020 there were 2.8 million documented
boardings in Nashville between January 1, 2020 and July
1, 2020 and for Chattanooga there were 465k documented
boardings between January 1, 2020 and July 1, 2020. Each row
in the respective datasets corresponded to a single boarding
event.
As complete data was available for Nashville, TN in 2019
we derived baseline ridership metrics by comparing weekly
data in 2020 directly to the corresponding week in 2019.
Additionally, the full 2019 data provided GPS locations which
allowed for spatial comparisons to baseline ridership. For
Chattanooga we were provided with aggregated monthly total
boardings in 2019. For baseline calculations we compared each
week with the average ridership per week in that month from
2019.
For Nashville, the GPS location of the vehicle at the time of
boarding was available for each boarding event. However for
Chattanooga, missing GPS readings were significant. Therefore to add GPS locations to the ridership data in Chattanooga
we joined the ridership data with a separate telemetry dataset
from on-board devices provided by ViriCiti [21]. For each
boarding event we used the unique vehicle identifier to find
the nearest GPS reading in the ViriCiti dataset. We filtered
out boarding events that did not have a GPS reading within a
60 second window of the boarding event. After this process
we found that approximately 4% of ridership boardings were
removed from the Chattanooga ridership dataset. Once the
ridership datasets were prepared, we used the GPS location
of each boarding event to assign that event to a 2010 Census
Tract for the spatial analysis provided in Section V-E and
Section V-F.
B. Economic data and COVID-19 new case counts
Economic data was retrieved from the United States Census
Bureau [22] and ProximityOne [23]. For each 2010 census
tract these sources provided a breakdown of racial demographics, income levels and housing information. New COVID-19
cases per day for Nashville and Chattanooga were retrieved
from The New York Times COVID-19 Dashboard [24] between January 1, 2020 and July 1, 2020.
C. Mapping boarding events to census tracts
To incorporate the census tract level economic data, each
boarding event was mapped to the corresponding census tract

A. COVID-19 restrictions and operational changes
Nashville and Chattanooga both receive guidance regarding
COVID-19 related restrictions directly from the State of Tennessee and also are available to impose their own regulations
in excess of the state’s recommendations. On March 5th the
first COVID-19 case was identified in Tennessee and on March
8th the first COVDI-19 case was found in Nashville. The
State of Tennessee ordered a State of Emergency regarding the
pandemic on March 12, 2020 and a Safer at Home order on
March 30, 2020 which mandated residents of the state stay in
their homes other than for "essential activities". The Tennessee
Safer at Home order ended on April 30 [25].
Nashville regulations were more swift. Nashville imposed
their own Stay at Home order on March 22 which was not
lifted until Phase 1 reopening began on May 11 which included
allowing gatherings of up to 10 people while most businesses
were allowed to open at 50% capacity. On May 25 Nashville
moved to Phase 2 which allowed gatherings of up to 25
people and most businesses could operate at 75% capacity
[26]. Nashville moved to a Phase 3 opening on June 20, 2020
which included provisions a limited opening for small venues
(up to 250 people) however reverted back to a Phase 2 opening
on July 3, 2020.
Both Nashville and Chattanooga reduced the total number
of trips in reaction to COVID-19. Unique trip identifiers were
not available in either dataset. Therefore to tally the number of
trips serviced per week we grouped the data by date, unique
driver ID, unique vehicle ID, route and direction. Chattanooga
moved to a reduced bus schedule in the middle of April
while Nashville switched to a reduced schedule on March 29,
2020. Prior to the schedule change, Chattanooga serviced 781
weekly fixed-line bus trips. During the week of April 19th
Chattanooga switched all weekdays to their Saturday schedule.
Between April 19th and July 1st, Chattanooga serviced 373
trips per week. Nashville switched to a reduced schedule
during the week of April 5. Prior to switching Nashville
serviced 1954 weekly trips which was reduced to 1035 weekly
trips. As we see in Section V-B, the most significant drops
in ridership occurred well before either city moved to their
respective reduced schedules.

FIGURE 1 : Weekly ridership compared to new COVID-19 cases per week for (a) Nashville and (b) Chattanooga. New
COVID-19 cases are at the county level. Nashville is in Davidson County, Chattanooga is in Hamilton County. Phases 1, 2
and 3 in (a) are per Nashville’s reopening plan provided by Nashville Metro. (c): Change in ridership compared to last year
for Chattanooga and Nashville, TN from January through June 2020. Change in ridership was calculated by comparing weekly
ridership to the baseline ridership from the same month in 2019.

B. Impact of COVID-19 on city-wide ridership
The fundamental question in this section is to what degree
has COVID-19 changed ridership and what effects do these
changes have on transit operations. Figure 1a and Figure 1b
show weekly total ridership and weekly new COVID-19 cases
in Nashville and Chattanooga respectively. Figure 1c shows
drop in ridership for Nashville and Chattanooga compared to
a baseline. The baseline was calculated by taking the average
weekly ridership for the corresponding month in 2019 for both
cities.
As shown in Figure 1a, Nashville public transit ridership
started to decline on the week of March 1st which corresponds
with the first known COVID-19 case in Tennessee on March
5th and the Tennessee State of Emergency Order on March

12. Perhaps more importantly there was a major tornado in
Nashville on March 3rd [27] which helps explain the initial
decline in ridership at this time. Ridership remained constant
for a week before a significant decline started during the week
of March 22nd when the Nashville Safer at Home Order was
put into effect on March 22, 2020. Nashville ultimately reached
a low of 60,620 riders on the week of April 19, a 66.9%
reduction from the average ridership in April of 2019 as shown
in Figure 1c. From late April to July 1st ridership stabilized.
By the week of June 28th ridership in Nashville has recovered
22.7% from the low in April. Chattanooga’s steep decline
started the week of March 5th before hitting a low also on the
week of April 19 with a low of 8,077 weekly riders as shown
in Figure 1b. Compared to the 2019 baseline, Chattanooga

and May–June 2020 for (a) Nashville and (b) Chattanooga.
January–February represents baseline pre-COVID ridership
levels in 2020 while May–June represents ridership after it
stabilized post-COVID.

C. Route level investigation
Figure 2a and Figure 2b show the monthly ridership
distribution on the top 5 routes for the city of Nashville
and Chattanooga respectively. We see similar trends to the
aggregated ridership analysis in the previous section. For
both cities ridership decreased rapidly before stabilizing in
April. In Nashville however we see a greater rebound between
April to June than in Chattanooga. The rebound in Nashville
corresponds loosely with Phase 2 reopening.
An important note is that for Chattanooga route 14 is one
of the most used routes however it is unique in that it is a free
shuttle service to the University of Tennessee, Chattanooga.
When Universities went online in March route 14 initially
continued operating on its regular Saturday schedule. Due to
the drastic demand reduction during this time Chattanooga
ultimately stopped the service entirely in April.
From this section we see that the most populated routes
follow a similar trajectory and magnitude of ridership drop as

had a 65.1% in ridership on April 19 Figure 1c. Ultimately
Chattanooga ridership recovered to 11,725 riders the week of
Jun 28th, an increase of 45.2% from the low of April 19-25.
Ultimately, both cities saw a rapid decline in ridership from
early March to late April before ridership stabilized through
the end of June. To characterize these findings, we refer to January through February as pre-COVID operations and starting
in late April a new normal post-COVID operations stabilized
at approximately 60% reduction in ridership compared to the
previous year for both cities.

the fixed-line transit system overall. Therefore a more detailed
temporal and spatial analysis is outlined in the following
sections of this paper.
D. Temporal analysis of transit usage and rider behavior
Here we investigate temporal changes in ridership between
pre-COVID and post-COVID operations. As discussed in Sec-

tion V-B, for both cities normal operations spanned from January 1st to the end of February and after a rapid drop ridership
stabilized in mid-to-late April. Therefore in this Section we
use January-February to represent pre-COVID operations and
May-June to represent post-COVID operations. In Figure 3a
and Figure 3b, we see the ridership distribution of Nashville
and Chattanooga for each day of the week before COVID-19
and after COVID-19. In both cities the drop in ridership on the
weekends is less than weekdays with Chattanooga only seeing
a 20% decrease in ridership on Saturdays and a 32% decrease
on Sundays compared to an average of 56% on weekdays.
Nashville saw a 41% decrease in ridership on Saturdays and
a 47% decrease on Sundays compared to an average of 57%
decrease for weekdays.
Figure 4a and Figure 4b show ridership in January-February
compared to May-June per hour of the day. We can see that
the biggest drops in ridership occur during morning rush and
evening rush. This is highlighted in Nashville where morning
rush (5:00AM-9:00AM) saw a 64% change in ridership and
evening rush (3:00PM-6:00PM) saw a 62% decrease compared
to 42% change between 9:00AM and 3:00PM. This discrepancy was not as pronounced with Chattanooga where there was
a 62% and 56% decrease in ridership for morning and evening
rush respectively compared to a 53% between 9:00AM and
3:00PM.
As we can see in this section, the biggest declines in
ridership were on weekdays during morning and evening commuting times. The declines continued after the Nashville and
Tennessee Stay at Home orders expired showing a persistent
shift towards alternative work options throughout the COVID19 pandemic. This phenomena was however more apparent in
Nashville than Chattanooga.

E. Spatial analysis of transit usage and rider behavior
In this section we look at spatial variation in ridership. Each
boarding was mapped to a corresponding 2010 census tract
in which that boarding occurred. Figure 5 shows the percent
decrease in ridership between pre-COVID (January-February)
and post-COVID (May-June) operations per census tract. As
shown, change in ridership was not uniformly spaced throughout either city. Both cities see significant decreases downtown,
most likely due to workers working remotely. This was most
visible in Chattanooga where ridership decreased by up to
81%. Chattanooga also saw a significant decrease in ridership
in the census tract that contains the University of Tennessee,
Chattanooga reflecting the University’s decision to suspend inperson operations and CARTA’s subsequent cancellation of the
free shuttle servicing this region. While the same patterns are
present in Nashville, change in ridership was more uniform
likely due to the density of Nashville’s downtown region.
Nashville saw significant decrease in ridership to areas heavily
dependent on retail and shopping which includes a 87% drop
to Opry Mills and a 86% drop to Green Hills.

F. Socio-economic analysis
As we have seen, ridership varies both temporally and
spatially in both cities. In this section we investigate the
correlation between decreases in ridership and socio-economic
factors. As a proxy for wealth we use median household
income per census tract. Figure 6 shows change in weekly
ridership for 2020 compared to baseline ridership in 2019
for the 10% highest income and 10% lowest income census
tracts in Nashville. We see a significantly greater decrease
in ridership for the high income group which saw a 77%
decrease in ridership in the week of April 27th. Meanwhile
the low-income group saw only a 58% decrease in the week
of April 27th, also a low. The trend lines follow a similar
trajectory for both groups, no significant time shift was found.
Additionally during post-COVID operations both groups saw
similar upward trends in ridership.
Table II provides Pearson correlation statistics for various income metrics and racial demographics for ridership
drop post-COVID. The moderate positive correlation between
median income and housing value reiterates the effects of
socio-economic status on ridership post-COVID. In Table II
a positive correlation refers to the case in which as the
metric increases the more severe the drop in ridership. The
highest positive correlation with drop in ridership was with
median housing value, i.e. census tracts with high median
housing costs had the greatest reduction in ridership from
2019 baseline. There was also a moderate negative correlation
between the percent of the population that was Hispanic and
change in ridership. There was no correlation between the
percentage of the census tract that was African American or
White.
There are two likely reasons that low-income areas see less
of a decrease in public transit usage. First, low-income families
are less likely to own a car [28]. Second, workers in grocery
stores, sanitation and cleaning, and logistics are often labeled
“essential” workers and still required travelling to their place
of work. Additionally, as local resources and jobs are often
limited in low-income areas [29] travel by public transit is a
necessary component of life for these groups, regardless of
COVID-19.

not. To date, there is no known mass transmission of COVID19 in Nashville or Chattanooga that originated on public transit. A well publicized case such as this would most certainly
have a negative impact on ridership. Historically mass transit
can be a source of influenza and coronavirus transmission [4]
however preliminary findings related to COVID-19 indicate
that fears of public transit may be exaggerated [9]. Regardless
it is imperative that transit agencies monitor social distancing
and put in place adequate sanitation safeguards.

for the 10% high income and 10% lowest income census tracts
in Nashville measured by median household income.

VI. Threats to Validity
One limitation of this work is that it is focused on two
cities, both in Tennessee. Government restrictions vary greatly
throughout the United States not only at the state level but at
the city level. Even in this study Nashville Metro, the local
government of Nashville and Davidson County, systematically
enforced restrictions that different from the Tennessee state
restrictions under which Chattanooga was regulated. While
Nashville has followed an outlined four stage opening plan
these stages many have different restrictions compared to other
cities and states. Additionally while Nashville had recently
moved to a more open stage three in late June it reverted
back to stage two by July 4, 2020. This careful approach is
necessary to ensure a safe reopening of cities, however from
an analysis point of view mixed messaging presents challenges
in correlating patterns with ridership demand. However, the
findings in this work align with preliminary findings across
the United States and the world [30].
Secondly, public transit includes confining passengers to an
enclosed space whether social distancing is implemented or

VII. Conclusion
In this work we presented a data-driven analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on ridership in Nashville and Chattanooga,
TN. We found that ridership dropped by 66.9% at its peak
in Nashville and by July 1, 2020 had stabilized at a 48.4%
reduction compared to 2019 baselines. Chattanooga ridership
dropped by 65.1% at its lowest point and stabilized at 42.8%
off its corresponding 2019 baseline.
We also showed that the most significant temporal factor
in ridership decline occurred during morning and evening
commute times. By combining spatial distributions of ridership decline with census level economic data we find that
high-income areas of Nashville saw a decreased ridership
of more than 19% compared to low-income areas (77% for
high-income vs 58% for low-income at their respective lows).
A moderate correlation between median income levels and
housing value and drop in ridership.
Future work includes developing low cost image processing
methods for ensuring social distancing on public transit. We
also plan on using the analysis in this work to set the ground
for agent-based simulation and modeling to predict ridership
behavior as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold.
