ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic triggered by SARS-CoV-2 is a worldwide health disaster. Main protease is an
attractive drug target among coronaviruses, due to its vital role in processing the polyproteins that are
translated from the viral RNA. There is presently no exact drug or treatment for this diseases caused by
SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we report the potential inhibitory activity of some FDA approved drugs
against SARS-CoV-2 main protease by molecular docking study to investigate their binding affinity in protease
active site. Docking studies revealed that drug Oseltamivir (anti-H1N1 drug), Rifampin (anti-TB drug),
Maraviroc, Etravirine, Indinavir, Rilpivirine (anti-HIV drugs) and Atovaquone, Quinidine, Halofantrine,
Amodiaquine, Tetracylcine, Azithromycin, hydroxycholoroquine (anti-malarial drugs) among others binds in the
active site of the protease with similar or higher affinity. However, the in-silico abilities of the drug molecules
tested in this study, further needs to be validated by carrying out in vitro and in vivo studies. Moreover, this
study spreads the potential use of current drugs to be considered and used to comprise the fast expanding
SARS-CoV-2 infection.

INTRODUCTION
A new occurred human coronavirus (COVID-19) is informed in December 2019 in Wuhan, China.1,2 Afterward,
the COVID-19 underway spreading across the world, putting the whole world on high attentive.3 The World
Health Organization (WHO) surveillance draft in January 2020 stated that, any traveller to Wuhan, Hubei
Province in China, two weeks earlier the onset of the signs, is supposed to be a COVID-19 case.4,5 On April
21st, 2020, a total of 2,31,4621 confirmed infections were reported worldwide, with 1,57,847 deaths with a
increasing mortality rate of >4.3%.5 The World Health Organization (WHO) strategy to comprise the distribution
includes the decrease of human-to-human dispersal by preventing the interaction between individuals,
accordingly avoiding transmission extension events and interactive critical risk evidence to all populations.5 In
India, the first case of the COVID-19 was reported in Kerala on 30 January 2020. As of 21 April, 2020, there are
14,255 cases and 559 deaths as reported by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India.6
COVID-19 is a member of Betacoronaviruses similar to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Human
coronavirus (SARS HCoV) and the also the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome Human coronavirus (MERS
HCoV).7 Main protease (Mpro) is the one of the greatest-characterized drug targets among coronaviruses.8
Beside with the papain-like protease(s), this main protease enzyme is vital for processing the polyproteins that
are translated from the viral RNA.8 This crucial function of main protease in virus duplication makes this enzyme
a capable target for the expansion of inhibitors and possible treatment remedy for infection of novel coronavirus.
To date, no precise therapeutic medicine or vaccine has been accepted for the management of human
coronavirus.
Some clinical trials, it has been described that anti-HIV drugs and chloroquine phosphate, an anti-malarial drug,
has a assured therapeutic effect on the COVID-19.9 In specific, chloroquine phosphate is suggested to treat
COVID-19 related pneumonia in larger inhabitants in the future. Subsequently, other clinical trials suggested
that hydroxychloroquine supplementary with azithromycin is very operative in the management of the COVID19.10 This encouraged us to accomplish a systematic study on some clinically approved medicines using
molecular docking and reinvestigate their biological efficacies and pharmacological properties. However, there
is no organized study on the inhibition of the coronavirus by clinically approved drugs to the best of our
knowledge. Hence, the present study was aimed to molecular docking studies of clinically approved drugs
against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Molecular Docking Methods
For molecular docking, Auto-Dock 4.2 software was used.11 The free energy (DG) binding of SARS-CoV-2 viral
protease with the selected FDA approved drugs was created by means of this molecular docking package.
Docking is a computational simulation method of a ligand binding to a receptor or enzyme and expects the
favored orientation of binding of one molecule to the second to form a steady complex. To predict the attraction
and activity of binding of the minor molecule to their enzyme targets by using scoring functions docking is used.
Therefore, docking shows significant role in the rational design of medicines. The sensitivity of docking
calculations concerning the geometry of the involvement ligand displays that even minor changes in the ligand
structure can lead to big changes in the geometries and scores of the subsequent docked poses.
Selection of Ligand
Anti-viral and anti-malarial medications were recognized as potential coronavirus inhibitors from diverse
literature evaluations. Total 47 FDA approved drugs were selected for molecular docking with main COVID-19
protease. Among the 47 approved drugs, 2 drugs are anti-H1N1 drugs, 4 are anti-TB drugs, 24 are anti-HIV-1
drugs and 17 are anti-malarial drugs are selected from PubChem database. The three-dimensional structure
files of the selected FDA approved drugs were downloaded in SDF format from the PubChem were used for
molecular docking. Molecular 2D structures of selected FDA approved drugs are shown in Table 1.

Selection of Target
The main COVID-19 protease remained used as a target to novelty repurposing candidates over computational
selection amongst clinically accepted drugs. The study identified a list of FDA permitted 47 drugs that may form
hydrogen bonds to key residues of amino acids within the binding pocket of viral protease and may too have a
higher tolerance to conflict mutations. The crystal 3D structure of SARS-CoV-i2 protease (PDB ID:6LU7)
remained obtained from Protein-Data Bank.12 (Figure-1).
Figure 1
The 3D crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 protease (PDB ID: 6LU7)

Meanwhile this protease has its crystal structure in a state that signifies the pharmacological target for the
progress of new medicines to treatment diverse infectious diseases. The preparation of the target enzyme 6LU7
with the Auto-Dock Tools software intricate addition of all H2 atoms to the enzyme, which is a step essential for
accurate calculation of fractional atomic charges. The ligand and all water molecules were detached to make
the structure for docking. Gasteiger charges are considered for each atom of the protein in AutoDock 4.2
instead of Kollman charges, which were used in the earlier versions of this package.
Docking Procedure
For ligand conformational incisive, we take the ‘Lamarckian-genetic algorithm (LGA)’, which is a mixture of a
genetic algorithm and a native search algorithm. This algorithm initially builds a population of entities, being a
diverse casual conformation of the docked enzyme. Each distinct protein is then mutated to attain a slightly
diverse translation and alternation and the local search algorithm then achieves energy minimizations on a userspecified amount of the population of individuals. The entities with the low subsequent energy are moved to the
succeeding generation and the procedure is then repetitive. This algorithm is called Lamarckian while every
novel group of entities is allowable to receive the local search variations of their parents.

To get many docked structures, Auto-Dock was run numerous times, and used to examine the expected
docking energy. Rapid energy assessment was attained by pre-calculating nuclear affinity capacities for every
atom in the compound molecule. The binding sites of the target enzyme for these molecules in the AutoGrid
process were designated on the patterns of founded ligand-binding pockets.13 Auto-Dock Tools deliver various
approaches to examine the outcomes of docking-simulations such as, structural resemblance, and other
limitations like inter-molecular energy, visualizing the binding site and its energy and inhibition constant. The
energy of interaction of every atom in the ligand was met. For each ligand, 10 best postures were made and
scored using Auto-Dock 4.2 scoring purposes.14

RESULTS
Computational approaches for drug discovery and development are proven to be effective and time efficient, as
they are not based on difficult laborious works. The protein-ligand docking elucidates the mechanism of
inhibition along with the specificity and efficiency of that ligand as an inhibitor. The association of drug candidate
(ligand) to its target receptor is a fundamental binding reaction and the aim of the computer-aided drug
discovery is to find small molecules having strong inhibitory or activating action against the biological targets.
The strength of inhibition or activation is elucidated through binding affinity.15
Docking Prediction of anti-H1N1 drugs
Oseltamivir and Zanamivir, two FDA approved drugs docked with SARS-CoV-2 main protease and obtained
binding energy is −7.39 kcal/mol and -3.88 kcal/mol respectively (Table-2). Oseltamivir interacted with Glu:166,
Pro:52, 168, Met:49,165, Leu:167, His:164, 41, Tyr:54, Gln:189, Arg:188, Asp:187, Thr:190 and Gln:192 at the
binding site of this SARS-CoV-2 protease and Zanamivir interacted with Glu:166, Leu:167, Met:165, Gln:189,
192, Thr:190, Ala:191, Pro:168, Gly:170 at the binding site of this protease (Figure 2). The results identified that
Oseltamivir is potential inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Earlier one study has reported that
Oseltamivir is a prodrug of oseltamivir carboxylate, a potent and selective inhibitor of the neuraminidase
glycoprotein essential for replication of influenza A and B viruses.16

Halofantrine, Amodiaquine, Tetracycline, Azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine docked with binding affinity 8.95, -8.84, -8.68, -8.65, -8.4, -8.32 and -8.30 kcal/mol against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Table 4). Docking
visualization of 6LU7 with seven anti-malarial drugs was showed in Figure 5. Among the seven potent inhibitors
Atovaquone was more potent with binding affinity -8.95 kcal/mol. Asn:142, Glu:166, Leu:141, Met:49, 165,
Cys:44, Pro:52, Tyr:54, Arg:188, Asp:187, His:41,164, 163, 172, Phe:140 and Gln:189 are the amino acid
residues involved in the interaction with Atovaquone (Figure 5). As these residues play an important role during
protein-ligand interaction, they may serve as a biomarker during the drug discovery process.18

This study focused on identification of potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 from corona virus to control the
viral replication. Outcomes from the In silico molecular docking study maintained the great inhibitory efficacy of
the one anti-H1N1 drug (Oseltamivir), one anti-TB drug (Rifampin), four anti-HIV drugs (Maraviroc, Etravirine,
Indinavir, Rilpivirine) and seven anti-malarial drugs (Atovaquone, Quinidine, Halofantrine, Amodiaquine,
Tetracylcine, Azithromycin, hydroxycholoroquine) since they could launch H 2 bonds with different amino acid
residues that caused in an inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 protease activity with higher binding affinity ranging from (10.67 to -8.3 kcal/mol). Thus, the projected binding interactions of the dynamic molecules with the protease by
the docking study evidently established their inhibitory strength towards catalytic response of the protease. This
study provides the support of the repurposed drugs, which may be helpful for the treatment of novel coronavirus
disease and can serve as potential drug candidates to curb the ongoing and ever enlarging COVID-19 pandemic.
Since all the drugs used in this study are of known pharmacokinetics standards and approved by FDA for human
use they do not need to undergo specific long term clinical trials and therefore can fasten up the process of the
therapeutics development.

DISCUSSION
Coronavirus fits to a set of viruses which can contaminate vertebrate animals and human. It has slaughtered
thousands of individuals around the world with growth in mortality rate each single day. Digestive, central nervous
system, liver, respiratory systems of humans and animlas hampered by this virus infection.19 Our study was
focused on the FDA approved drugs against the main protease in coronavirus, as a possible beneficial target for
the management of coronavirus. 6LU7 (PDB ID) is the major protease in COVID-19 that has been relocated and
structured in PDB newly and is available to everybody in the world (Figure 1). For the proteolytic maturation of
virus, the protease is precise significant. Protease has been studied as a possible target to avoid the extent of
contamination by inhibiting viral polyprotein cleavage via blocking active sites of the protein. With this new finding
of protease assembly in COVID-19, has providing an enormous chance to recognize possible drug candidates for
the management of coronavirus.20 In this study, we have applied a computational approach of FDA approved
drugs in order to find a specific therapeutic possible agent against COVID-19. We have selected 47 FDA
approved antiviral, anti-H1N1, anti-TB and anti-viral drugs and retrived directly from the PubChem (National
Library of Medicine). Molecular docking was accomplished with the 47 drugs against COVID-19 structure.
Molecular docking is a computational technique which aims to find non-Covalent binding among protein (receptor)
and a ligand/inhibitor (small molecule). For recognized binding site, the docking expects the method of interaction
among a target protein and a ligand. Binding energy proposes the attraction of an exact ligand and asset by
which a ligand interacts with and binds to the pocket of a target protein. A drug with a lesser binding energy (ΔG)

is chosen as a probable drug candidate. In order to recognize the effect of active antiviral drugs on COVID-19, 47
FDA approved antiviral compounds were selected and performed molecular docking against COVID-19. Docking
results of SARS-CoV-2 protease with selected 47 drugs out of the selected 13 showed best docking score and
were found to be best molecules at the target site of the protein. Out of the 13 drugs, Maraviroc exhibited the best
docked score (-10.67 kcal/mol) with SARS-CoV-2 protease. HIS:164, 41, TYR:54, ASP:187, MET:165, 49,
LEU:167,141, PRO:168, CYS:44, 145, ARG:188, GLY:143, ASN:142, ALA:191, GLN:192, 189 and THR:190 are
the amino acid residues participating in the interaction at the binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 protease (Figure
4A).
Maraviroc is an effective anti-retroviral agent permitted for the treatment of HIV-1 infection that blocks interaction
among the virus and the CCR5 co-receptor, a critical step in the HIV-1 replication. Earlier clinical trials of this
drug have established the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of maraviroc in both treatment-naive and treatmentexperienced patients.21,22 Among the 17 anti-malarial approved drugs, Atovaquone presented best docking score
(-8.95 kcal/mol) and ASN:142, GLU:166, LEU:141, MET:49, 165, CYS:44, PRO:52, TYR:54, ARG:188, ASP:187,
HIS:41,164, 163, 172, PHE:140, GLN:189 are the amino acid residues participating in the interaction at the
binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 protease (Figure 5A). Recent studies also explores that, Atovaquone significantly
inhibited ZIKV (Zika virus) in human placental JEG3 cells in vitro.23

CONCLUSION
The present study concludes that, thirteen clinically approved drugs are identified as potent inhibitors against
SARS-CoV-2 protease activity. These outcome afford a strong foundation for the use of these drugs are for
CORONA management. Moreover, the dynamic ligands inhibited the catalytic response of protease by blocking
the residues of amino acids intricate in the processing and strand transmission reactions. The interactions by the
structural model at the protease active site can afford a valuable guide for additional strategies for structurebased medicines and development of new operative inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 protease. Therefore, the effect of
these inhibitors can be further revealed through in vitro and in vivo analysis in the termination of intracellular
replication of corona virus, prior to the use as drugs in humans.
