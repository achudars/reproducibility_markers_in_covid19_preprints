Abstract. By characterising the time evolution of COVID-19 in term of its “velocity”
(log of the new cases per day) and its rate of variation, or “acceleration”, we show that
in many countries there has been a deceleration even before lockdowns were issued.
This feature, possibly due to the increase of social awareness, can be rationalised by a
susceptible-hidden-infected-recovered (SHIR) model introduced by Barnes, in which a
hidden (isolated from the virus) compartment H is gradually populated by susceptible
people, thus reducing the effectiveness of the virus spreading. By introducing a
partial hiding mechanism, for instance due to the impossibility for a fraction of the
population to enter the hidden state, we obtain a model that, although still sufficiently
simple, faithfully reproduces the different deceleration trends observed in several major
countries.

The spread of COVID-19 in all countries is being reported with a massive wealth
of data. Although data are collected by different sources, at different stages and
with heterogeneous protocols (different national policies, etc.), this huge amount of
information allows detailed statistical analysis of the process (see for example [1–19])
and enables robust tests on the universal behaviour of the epidemic dynamics through
different communities.
Simple models as the susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) scheme [20] historically
have been used to describe the salient properties of the spreading statistics by relying
on an economic amount of parameters and a mean field approach based on a system
of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The SIR model is especially suited to
describe closed, spatially homogeneous communities [21]. Deviations from the simple
SIR dynamics may reveal changes in the social behaviour that eventually reduce the
spreading of the disease.
The SIR model may be cast in terms of fractions of population at a given time
(day) t: St , It , and Rt , represent respectively the fraction of susceptible, infected, and
recovered people, so that St + It + Rt = 1 (note that in Rt we are not distinguishing
the kind of exit from the infectious state). Its characteristic feature is that susceptibles
are infected at a rate proportional both to their number and to the fraction of infected
people. By indicating time derivatives by dots, e.g. Ṡt = dSt /dt, the SIR evolution
sketched in figure1(a) is described by three coupled differential equations,

where the “contact rate” β is a constant determining the strength of the spreading in
the transition rate from S to I. The healing rate µ, according to the literature, should
be related to a healing time 1/µ of the order of two weeks (reported recovery times
range from a few days [22] to almost four weeks [23]). If β > µ, the SIR model predicts
an exponential explosion of It ∼ e(β−µ)t in the early stages of the epidemic. To a good
degree, this is the kind of scaling that one could expect in all countries before their

lockdown was eventually issued. However, we will show that this is not always the case.
In this paper we collect data for some countries where the statistics is significant
and sufficiently regular, especially in the first stage of the pandemic expansion, and we
introduce a non-standard way of describing its time evolution, by defining a “velocity”
vt of the spreading and its time derivative, or “acceleration” at . A v-a diagram is useful
for comparing the various stages of the epidemic as it shows at a glance not only the
number of new cases per day, but also the trend in its variation, in a range of unities
for v and a.
From the v-a diagrams of several countries it emerges that the COVID-19 spreading
was decelerating already before the application of the lockdown. Since the SIR model
predicts a constant acceleration, it cannot explain this observed scaling. However, this is
fairly well reproduced by a simple extension called SHIR (susceptible-hidden-infectiousrecovered) model, recently introduced by Barnes [12]. In this model one includes a
fraction of “hidden” people Ht , who either decide or are forced to isolate from the rest
of the susceptible community S at hiding rate σ, see figure 1(b). The time evolution of
SHIR is then governed by the following set of differential equations:

In this picture the deceleration of the epidemic spreading before a lockdown is simply
due to a steadily increase of the subset H the population that, although susceptible, is
becoming aware of the potential danger of the virus and changes its social behaviour
accordingly. The importance of social awareness on epidemic spreading can be
investigated by different perspectives. For instance one can look at how the interplay
between individual risk perception and resource support between individuals can impact
on the epidemic dynamics [13]. Moreover, since individuals react differently to risk,
the effect of heterogeneity in self-awareness can be taken into account by considering
epidemic spreading dynamics on artificial networks and look for the correlation between
node degree and self-awareness [14]. Our study thus adds to the list of recent
works [12–17] highlighting that the standard SIR exponential scaling law is not suitable
to describe the COVID-19 epidemic.
We show below that the SHIR model has indeed an acceleration at with an
exponential decrease down to an asymptotic value. However, although data (before and)
after lockdowns comply fairly well with its prediction, we find that a simple extension of
the SHIR model, where only part of susceptible population can access the hidden state,
can improve significantly the fit of the available data. This holds both for countries where
the lockdown reduced the epidemic spreading to a negative acceleration (e.g. Germany
and Italy) and for those where the lockdown only reduced the acceleration to a positive
value smaller than the initial one (e.g. Brazil and India, during the initial months of

4
the epidemic). The fact that a complete depletion of the susceptible compartment is
not fully compatible with epidemic data was previously discussed in [17] where this
possibility was avoided by including a reversible hiding mechanism with an additional
flux H → S rather then splitting the susceptible population in S and S 0 as done here.
By considering SIR-like models we thus assume that the population is well mixed.
In this scenario mean field models are known to give a good description of the
epidemic. Note, however, that non-exponential epidemic trends might be generated
by considering the epidemic dynamics to take place on a quenched network describing
personal contacts [15].
1. Data analysis, averaging and rescaling
Since universal features of disease spreading should better emerge from relative figures,
we perform the analysis on the number of confirmed cases over the total population
of a given country. Data were downloaded from the repository for the 2019 Novel
Coronavirus Visual Dashboard operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for
Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) [24].
The dataset includes the cumulative number Ft of cases at date t = 0, 1, 2, . . .,
i.e. the total number of people tested to have been infected by the virus up to time
t, out of N people in the ensemble. In the notation of the SIR model, this number
Ft = N (It + Rt ) corresponds to the current count of infectious people N It (databases
might add tested asymptomatic people in this counting) plus the number N Rt of
previously infected people.
The new cases per day, nt = Ft − Ft−1 ' Ḟt are a manifestation of the epidemic
spreading speed. Since this quantity is noisy due to statistical fluctuations and other
factors (variable medical protocols, number of tests, weekly periodicity, etc.) we consider
instead the number of new cases occurred in a period ending at time t and averaged
(smoothed) over a window of L days:
(L)

nt

=

Ft − Ft−L
.

(3)

This quantity is reported in figure 2 for different countries. The figure shows that,
over a time scale of two to three weeks, after lockdowns (black dots) there has been
either a decrease of the number of cases per day or a decrease in the acceleration of the
spreading (smaller positive slope of curves). In later periods, when the lockdowns were
removed in the European counties, one notes the restart of second and further waves of
the epidemic in those countries. However, maybe less evident, there also appears to be
some negative curvature in the plots before lockdowns. This feature is better analysed
with the following procedure.

From now on we consider L = 14, z = 3.
The typical exponential trends of the disease evolution suggest to consider log scales
for a better visualisation and characterisation of the stage of the spreading. Hence, we
portray the trajectory of the disease (parameterised by time t) by its velocity vt in log
scale and by the rate of its variation, or “acceleration” at . These are defined by their
proxies

where N is the total population of a given country. The numerical pre-factor ln 10 in the
definition of the acceleration simplifies formulas later. Figure 3 shows the trajectories of
the epidemic spreading in the (v, a) plane for the six selected countries: one can notice
that all trajectories start from the upper left corner, they continue with increasing v
(a > 0) and eventually cross the a = 0 axis. From there, typically a becomes negative
indicating a period of recession of the viral disease. However, this occurs with such
a slowly receding velocity (small negative values of a) that random fluctuations in the

with major COVID-19 outbreaks: time parameterises trajectory with a colour code
from red to blue, black dots mark the major lockdown dates during Spring 2020, and
an empty diamond indicates the last day of a trajectory. Starting from the upper
left corner, trajectories continue to increase the spreading velocity vt as long as at
remains positive while decreasing. When at turns to negative values, trajectories start
to regress the velocity to lower values. It is visible that when social measures are
loosened (green turning to blue region for Italy, Germany, and UK), fluctuations seem
to bring back the trajectories to the at > 0 phase, leading to oscillations around the
a ≈ 0 region or to eventual further outbreaks.

population of S or I may bring the system back to the dynamics characterised by a > 0,
i.e v increasing phase. Note that for some countries as Brazil and India, the period of
positive acceleration has been longer than in other countries and recession has been, so
far, negligible. It is particularly for these cases that an extension of the SHIR model is
needed (see next section).
Clearly all trajectories show a consistent drop in at after the application of the
national lockdowns (see black point along the trajectory). Nevertheless, there are
countries in which deceleration sets in several days before their lockdowns due to the
application of some preventive not draconian measures. In Germany, for instance, the
cancellation of several public events started before the official lockdown and has probably
slowed down the spreading of COVID-19. In Italy, the national lockdown was preceded
by the isolation of so called local ”red zones” (where initial cases were detected) from the
rest of the community. This measure would be placed at the beginning of the trajectory

7
in figure 3, suggesting that it was effective in inducing the strong initial decrease of the
spreading acceleration in Italy.
Next, we analyse this non trivial behaviour analytically for the SIR and SHIR
model, then we perform fits to data to assess the performance of the SHIR model,
finally we extend this model to improve the agreement with data and we discuss the
implications of our results.
2. Model trends of the acceleration
Since the simplest part of the epidemic evolution ranges from its initial rise to the end of
the lockdowns, we have isolated the portion of the time series within this time window.
For each country this is done by shifting the time t − t0 → t to set t = 0 to a day (t0
in the original scale) close to the first maximum of at and by keeping a period of about
two to three months since then. In this way we exclude the possibility of including in
the analysis the onset of potential second waves of the spreading.
Let us start by considering the SHIR dynamics (2), of which the standard SIR
model is a special case with σ = 0. For this model the confirmed cases have a time
derivative
Ḟt = N (I˙t + Ṙt ) = N βSt It

(7)

and the velocity becomes
v = log10 Ḟt /N
= log10 β + log10 St + log10 It .

(8)

Since the fraction of infected people has been always at most of the order of 10−4 one
can safely assume that the decreasing of the susceptible population St is mainly due
to an increase of the hidden fraction of responsible people, Ht . If the rate σ is large
enough, i.e. so that σSt  βSt It , from (2) it follows that St decays exponentially as
St = S0 e−σt . Using this scaling, we have a velocity
vt ' log10 β + log10 S0 −

σt
+ log10 It ,
ln 10

(9)

and acceleration
at ' βS0 e−σt − µ − σ.

(10)

Hence, according to the SIR model, since in most countries the condition Ft  N
is still fulfilled and St ' 1, one would expect a spreading with constant acceleration
a ' β − µ from (10). This contrasts with data shown in figure 3 and figure 4: even at
initial stages (before lockdowns), in Germany, Italy, and UK it is readily seen a natural
decrease of at . In this respect the SIR model is too simple to describe the initial trend
of the COVID-19 spreading, as highlighted also by Barnes [12] by simply looking at the
ratio of new cases over the total ones.

8

Figure 4. Time series of the virus spreading “acceleration” at for six countries with
major COVID-19 outbreaks, in the period before eventual second waves and with red
dots marking the lockdown dates, and fits according to SHIR and SS’HIR models,
both performed with dedicated python libraries for nonlinear fits. For Italy, Germany,
UK, and Russia one notes that the asymptotic value of at is not correctly recovered by
the SHIR model. This value is only approximated for India and Brazil by introducing
a tiny value σ for the transition rate to the hidden state (see table 1). The SS’HIR
variant, on the other hand, can fit the long time value as well as the early stage of at
by yielding reasonable values of σ.

On the other hand the SHIR model explains economically the deceleration by
allowing a fast discharge of St via a sufficiently large hiding rate σ; this is a sensible
assumption, as it does not take many days to organise a reduced level of contact between
people.
In figure 4 we show the time series of the epidemic acceleration for different
countries. The dotted curves represent the fits of data based on (10) where we have
assumed S0 . 1, µ = 1/14 day−1 and let the parameters σ and β vary freely (the tiny
initial I0 value is also left as a free parameter). Note that it is not possible to consider
µ as a further free parameter since the number of new cases per day is not very sensible
to its value. Fortunately, this also means that the fits are quite independent on the
chosen value of µ. By assigning a weight wt = nt to each data point, the best fit gives
the estimates of σ and β reported in table 1. In figure 4 one notes that the SHIR model
(see dotted curves) gets sufficiently close to the observed trends of the acceleration;

9
there are however some visible deviations at short times and, most importantly, in some
cases also at long times. Furthermore, some very small estimates of σ reported in table 1
corroborate the idea that some extension of the SHIR model may improve the agreement
with the real data.
For these reasons, we test a model in which the long time limit of St is not negligible
even if σ 6= 0. This is obtained by dividing the fraction of susceptible population in two
groups: a fraction S 0 can access freely the hidden state, as sketched in figure 1(c), while
a fraction S could not access the isolated condition (for reasons as work duties, poverty,
etc.). The evolution equations of this SS’HIR model become

To partition the initial fraction of the susceptibles we consider a parameter p ≤ 1 such
that S00 = p(1 − I0 ) ' p and S0 = (1 − p)(1 − I0 ) ' 1 − p. The number of new cases per
day in this model is given by
Ḟt = N (I˙t + Ṙt ) = N β(St + St0 )It

(16)

By fitting data with this formula we get the values listed in table 1, which are more
realistic than those obtained from the fits based on the SHIR model. For instance, the
unrealistic value σ ' 0.001 day−1 now becomes σ ' 0.049 day−1 , in line with other
values. The fits in figure 4 show that the SS’HIR model can correctly capture the trend
of the acceleration in a long time span, including also long time values of at ≈ 0 (Russia)
or at > 0 (Brazil and India). ‡ Note that the estimated values of p ' 0.8 for Brazil and
India mean that, in the SS’HIR modelling, a fraction S0 ' 1 − p ≈ 0.2 of the population
cannot isolate itself from the rest of the community. A classic SIR dynamics on this 20%
of the population, with β(1 − p) − µ & 0 might be the reason for which the epidemic
has been continuing to accelerate for some months in those countries.
The analysis of twelve more countries (see figure 5 and table 2) shows that the
SS’HIR model is flexible enough to fit different scenari. For example it reproduces fairly
well both the non-monotonic trend of at for Austria and the convergence to the almost
null value of at in United States, Sweden, and Poland (whose possible origin is discussed
in [15]).
Finally, we notice that the estimated values of the contact rate β are likely to be an
overestimate of the parameter βtrue that corresponds to an expanded scenario in which
asymptomatic (i.e. undetected infected) cases are taken into account [1–3, 7, 8]. Indeed,
‡ By “long time” we mean an intermediate regime in which the lockdown has generated stable
conditions.

in the simplest possible description, the main effect of these asymptomatic cases on
the early epidemic dynamics might be a biased estimate β = βtrue /f , where f is the
probability of a susceptible person to become infected rather than asymptomatic. This
can be shown by mapping a SIR dynamics with βtrue and healing rate µ, in which visible
infected cases It and asymptomatic ones At are summed within a compartment, to the
SIR dynamics without At = 1−f
It . These two SIR models yield the same depletion
f
of St if their constant are related as β = βtrue /f . Note that βtrue < β and its value
may depend (through f ) also on the efficiency of a given health care system to detect
infected cases. Assuming a fraction f ≈ 0.5 [3], we would have βtrue around one half of
the values shown in table 1. Possibly the presence of asymptomatic cases will emerge
more clearly in the late stage of the epidemic dynamics, when St = 1 − It − At − Rt
becomes sufficiently different from the measured non infected fraction 1 − It − Rt , so
that herd immunity is reached earlier than expected.
3. Discussion
We have presented a velocity-acceleration diagram that visualises the epidemic state and
its trend. In the v-a diagrams of COVID-19 evolution, illustrated in this work for six
large countries, we note that the acceleration is not constant often in periods including
days before national lockdowns. The observed deceleration cannot be explained by a bias
introduced by a variable number of tests, which were in general following an opposite
trend increasing with time. This suggests that social distancing, either introduced by
local lockdowns, personal choices, or cancellation of public events due to the news from
Asia, was already effectively reducing to some degree the spreading of the virus.
The simplest effective explanation of the observed deceleration in the number of
new COVID-19 cases per day comes from assuming that the fraction of susceptible
population is reduced over a time scale 1/σ of tens of days/weeks by the isolation
imposed by the national lockdowns. This confirms the findings by Barnes’ with the
SHIR model. Building upon this model, we have introduced a simple modification
in which only part of the population can comply with the enforcement of strict social
distancing. The remaining part obeys the usual rules of the SIR model. Our modification
better fits the data from several countries, especially those where the acceleration of the
spreading has remained positive for months, where our fits suggest that about 20% of
the population effectively was never socially isolated.
There remains to understand how much the timescale 1/σ that emerges for most of
the isolation dynamics is actually representative of a more complex mixture of effects,
eventually including the personal evolution in the stages of the illness (as for exposed
compartments in the SEIR model [11]), which is not considered in the basic SIR model.
However, the SEIR and similar variants of the SIR model could not fit quantitatively, so
far, the observed deceleration of the pandemic spreading (data not shown) if a fraction
of “hidden” people H is not included. Moreover, also simple models including an
asymptomatic fraction of the population could not explain the observed deceleration

13
of the epidemic: we have argued that the effect of the undetected cases in the early
epidemic is mostly just a rescaling of the measured contact rate β.
