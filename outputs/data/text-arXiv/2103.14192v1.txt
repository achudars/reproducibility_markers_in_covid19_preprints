Abstract
During the COVID-19 pandemic, community containment measures have been
implemented in different parts of the world. However, despite government
recommendations and mandates, a progressive increase in mobility was observed in
several sites. This phenomenon is often referred to as "quarantine fatigue".
Mathematical models have been used for more than a century to study the dynamics of
diseases spread. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large number of models
have been developed to investigate different aspects of the pandemic. The aim of the
present work has been to design and explore a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2
spread with quarantine fatigue. A deterministic model represented by a system of
differential equations, based on Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) dynamics, was
developed. The model was explored by means of computational simulations. The results
obtained show that, in some scenarios, after a first prevalence peak, fatigue can cause a
second peak. Thus, the dynamic behavior of the model suggests that fatigue may have
contributed to the production of the second peak of infected people observed in different
parts of the world between 2020 and early 2021. The explorations performed also
showed that the model is sensitive to infection rate and other parameters related to
propagation dynamics. The developed model is relatively simple and has important
limitations for performing accurate predictions in the real world. However, our study
highlights the importance of considering quarantine fatigue in the management of the
current COVID-19 pandemic, as well as of possible future pandemics caused by other
pathogens.

1. Introduction
The first case of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), the disease caused by the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was reported in
Wuhan city, China, in December 2019 (World Health Organization, 2020). Since then,
the pandemic has spread around the globe, and by the end of March 2021 has already
produced about 126 million cases and more than two and a half million deaths
(Worldometers.info, 2021).
During the COVID-19 pandemic, different health control strategies have been
implemented, such as isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community
containment (Mackenzie et al., 2020). Community containment involves the entire
population, and includes measures that limit interaction between people and restrict
movement, such as canceling social gatherings, closing schools, closing work offices
and restricting travel (Wilder-Smith & Freedman, 2020).
Quarantine and isolation are old measures used by mankind to control the spread of
diseases (Gensini et al., 2004; Cetron & Landwirth, 2005; Nugent, 2020). However,
community containment measures are less common. Previously, community
containment measures had already been implemented in some places and, along with
quarantine and isolation, were successful in stopping the 2003 SARS outbreak (WilderSmith et al., 2020). However, the COVID-19 pandemic led to the implementation of
community containment measures with unprecedented global reach.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been observed that, despite community
containment measures, "quarantine fatigue" occurs in some scenarios, which would
cause a consequent increase in cases (Dincer & Gillanders, 2020; Sun et al., 2020; Zhao
et al., 2020). We will say that quarantine fatigue exists when, despite government
mandates and recommendations, population mobility increases over time. The study of
this phenomenon could be related to the field of behavioral epidemiology, a field where
mathematical models would be very useful tools (Bauch et al., 2013).
Mathematical models have been used for more than a century to study the dynamics
of diseases spread (Brauer, 2017). In compartmental epidemiological models, the
population is divided into compartments, according to the different stages of the disease
or other characteristics related to the epidemiology of the phenomenon under study. For
example, in a classical SIR model, the population is divided into three compartments:
susceptible (S), infected (I) and recovered with immunity (R). The transition between
different stages is then represented, through a formal scheme, as a function of time. In
the classical SIR model, there are two transitions: S→I and I→R. Each transition
depends on a parameter. Thus, the transition S→I depends on the infection rate and the
transition I→R depends on the recovery rate (Weiss, 2013).
Another important measure for the development of epidemiological models is the
basic reproductive number, R0, which is defined as the average number of new
2

infections that are caused by an infected individual within a population where all other
individuals are susceptible (Mishra et al., 2011). The R0 of SARS-CoV-2 would be
quite variable. In a meta-analysis, Alimohamadi et al. (2020) found a range of R0 from
1.9 to 6.49, and estimated a pooled R0 of 3.32, with a 95% confidence interval of 2.81 to
3.82.
Since the spread of SARS-CoV-2 began, a large number of models have been
developed to study different aspects of the pandemic (Adiga et al., 2020; Mustafa et al.,
2020). Different models show how community containment measures can reduce virus
circulation (for example, Zhou et al., 2020; Fang et al., 2020). The objective of the
present work has been to develop and explore a theoretical model of SARS-CoV-2
spread with quarantine fatigue.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. The model
A deterministic model was developed to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The
model is represented by the following system of 6 differential equations:
dS H
 S I
  H H H  fS H
dt
NH

(1)

dI H  H S H I H

 I H  fI H
dt
NH

(2)

dRH
 I H  fRH
dt
dS M
 S I
  M M M  fS H
dt
NM

(3)
(4)

dI M  M S M I M

 I M  fI H
dt
NM

(5)

dRM
 I M  fRH
dt

(6)

The population was divided into two groups, which we gave arbitrary names in order
to simplify the nomenclature: at home (H ) and mobile (M ). Within group H, individuals
spend more time at home and are less mobile. In contrast, within group M, individuals
spend less time at home and are more mobile.

3

A SIR scheme was considered. Thus, SH (t), IH (t) and RH (t) represent the number of
susceptible, infected and recovered individuals within group H at time t, respectively.
Similarly, SM (t), IM (t) and RM (t) are the number of susceptible, infected and recovered
individuals within group M. NH (t) and NM (t) are the total number of individuals in
groups H and M, respectively:

N H (t )  S H (t )  I H (t )  RH (t )

(7)

N M (t )  S M (t )  I M (t )  RM (t )

(8)

SP (t), IP (t) and RP (t) are the number of susceptible, infected and recovered
individuals in the whole population:

S P (t )  S H (t )  S M (t )

(9)

I P (t )  I H (t )  I M (t )

(10)

RP (t )  RH (t )  RM (t )

(11)

NP (t) is the total number of people in the population:

N P (t )  N H (t )  N M (t )

(12)

Within the population, iH (t) and iM (t) are the proportion of infected individuals
belonging to groups H and M, respectively:

iH (t ) 

I H (t )
N P (t )

(13)

iM (t ) 

I M (t )
N P (t )

(14)

The proportion of infected individuals in the whole population is iP (t):

iP (t ) 

I P (t )
N P (t )

(15)

In both groups, the per capita infection rate or force of infection, λ, is assumed to
depend on the proportion of infected individuals: λ = I / N, where  is an infection
parameter proportional to the contact rate and the probability of transmission (Keeling
& Rohani, 2008).

4

Thus, H and M are the infection parameters in groups H and M, respectively. We
assume that H < M. Infected individuals recover and acquire immunity with a recovery
rate γ.
After a certain tolerance period T, individuals in group H begin to fatigue. In terms of
the model, this means that they move from group H to group M with a fatigue rate f .
Thus, from time instant T onwards, the number of individuals in group H decreases,
while the number of individuals in group M increases. The diagram of the model is
shown in Figure 1.

2.2. Numerical simulations
The dynamics of the model were explored through numerical simulations.  values
of between 0.06 and 0.30 1/day were used, in agreement with the range of reproductive
numbers published in previous meta-analyses (Alimohamadi et al., 2020; Billah et al.,
2020). We assumed R0 =  / γ (Keeling & Rohani, 2008). An infectious period of 14 days
was established (Martelucci et al., 2020). The recovery rate, γ , is the inverse of the
infectious period (Earn, 2008), so a value of 0.07 1/day was used for γ. The fatigue rate
f , the ratio H /M, the tolerance period T and the initial conditions were arbitrary.
A benchmark case was established with the following initial conditions and
parameters. Initial conditions (number of individuals): SH (0) = 990 000, IH (0) = 10 000,
RH (0) = 0, SM (0) = 99 000, IM (0) = 1 000, RM (0) = 0. Parameters (1/day): H = 0.08,

M = 0.20, γ = 0.07, f = 0.06. A T period of 200 days was considered.

5

The effects of H , M , f and T on the temporal evolution of the prevalence in the
whole population, iP (t), were studied. These measures were modified one at a time,
keeping the rest of the conditions as in the benchmark case. The results were analyzed
qualitatively.
Simulations and plots were performed using R software, version 4.0.3 (R Core Team,
2020). The R deSolve package was used for the simulations (Soetaert et al., 2010). The
plots were performed with R base packages and R ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2016).

3. Results
Figure 2 shows the evolution of the proportion of infected individuals in the
benchmark case. The whole population prevalence curve, iP (t), has 2 noticeable peaks.
The first peak occurs around 40 days, with a prevalence of approximately 0.04. After
the first peak, the prevalence drops and remains at relatively low values until the
200-day tolerance period T ends. From day 200, iP (t) begins to increase again and a
second peak occurs around 270 days, with a prevalence of approximately 0.12. After
this second peak, the prevalence in the population decreases again and tends to zero.
The fraction iM (t) also experiences two peaks, which coincide with the two peaks of
whole population prevalence. This indicates that the two peaks of whole population
prevalence are produced by the increase of infected in group M. After the first peak,
iM (t) drops to values very close to zero, and remains almost zero until it begins to
increase after day 200.
The iH (t) fraction grows more slowly than the iM (t) fraction, and has a relatively low
peak of about 0.015 at around 110 days. The iH (t) fraction prevents iP (t) from reaching
near zero between the two peaks of whole population prevalence.
In Figure 3 it is shown the evolution of the number of susceptible, infected and
recovered individuals within each group, H and M, which clarifies the results presented
in Figure 2. Within group H, after the 200-day tolerance period T, there are about 12 000
infected individuals, but there are still about 780 000 susceptible people. Infection of
these susceptible individuals causes the second peak of whole population prevalence.
Fatigue contributes to the second peak being higher than the first, since, due to the
fatigue rate, after 200 days, H individuals gradually become M individuals, and
susceptible individuals in the group M are more likely to become infected than
susceptible individuals in the group H.
The influence of H , M , f and T on the total proportion of infected people, iP (t), is
depicted in figures 4 to 7, respectively. As H increases, the first peak of population
prevalence increases, and the prevalence values between the two peaks are also higher
(Figure 4). However, when H increases, the second peak prevalence is reduced. This is

6

because increasing H reduces the number of susceptible individuals remaining in group
H after 200 days.

0.12

When M increases, the two prevalence peaks increase and occur earlier (Figure 5).
The increase in fatigue rate f does not influence the first prevalence peak, but, as
expected, causes an increase in the second peak (Figure 6). The increase in T reduces
the second prevalence peak and delays its arrival (Figure 7). In particular, when there is
no tolerance period (T = 0), the curve presents a single peak, around day 50.

4. Discussion
In a pandemic caused by a novel and aggressive virus, such as SARS-CoV-2, in the
absence of other tools, community containment measures are very useful, as they reduce
infections and deaths, and prevent the collapse of health systems (Prem et al., 2020;
Salzberger et al., 2020). However, they could also produce negative effects in other
areas (Hawryluck et al., 2004; Chu et al., 2020; Dubey et al., 2020). The challenge is to
find an optimal solution that takes into account the effects of different variables
(Chowdhury et al., 2020). Mathematical models could be powerful resources to address
such challenge.
In the present work, we have developed a model that attempts to represent quarantine
fatigue in the context of the pandemic produced by the spread of the SARS-CoV-2
virus. Through numerical simulations, we show that the model is sensitive to parameters
related to the infection rate, the tolerance time to community containment measures and
the fatigue rate.
Between 2020 and early 2021, in different parts of the world, the evolution of the
number of infected people over time has shown two notable peaks (World Health
Organization, 2021). The simulations performed in our study show how, within the
model we have proposed, fatigue can cause a second prevalence peak.
The relaxation of protective measures and its negative impact on epidemics control
would not be something new. This phenomenon could also occur with some sexually
transmitted diseases (Martí-Pastor et al., 2015), and could have occurred in some
scenarios during the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009 (Herrera-Valdez, 2011).
One of the uses of an epidemiological model is to alert about the information that
should be collected in order to have more knowledge about the spread and control of the
disease under study (Anderson & May, 1998). In this sense, we consider that our model
could stimulate the development of field work focused on solving important questions
related to quarantine fatigue, such as the following: when does fatigue begin?, what
situations promote or discourage it?, how is it distributed within the population?
Epidemiological models enable the study of complex phenomena by simplifying
reality. Depending on each model, this approach may have various limitations. Our
model, which is relatively straightforward, presents different simplifications that would
limit its usefulness. Some of the most important ones are mentioned below.
The model assumes that there are only two groups in relation to the degree of
mobility. Individuals from one group do not mix with individuals from the other group.
The flow between the two groups is unidirectional: individuals with less mobility, when
fatigued, can move to the group with higher mobility, where the infection rate is higher.
But individuals with higher mobility can never move to the other group. Infection rates
within each group do not change as a function of time. No distinction is made between
symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals. There is no division by age group.
13

Protective behaviors, such as the use of masks, are not explicitly represented. The model
does not include testing, isolation nor vaccination strategies. Different strains of the
virus are also not considered.
However, our model does not pretend to represent a specific scenario, nor to make
accurate predictions. Instead, it is a theoretical model that would serve as a first
approach to the study of quarantine fatigue. This model could be taken as a scaffold to
build a more complex and realistic model, focused on particular cases.

5. Conclusion
The present work suggests that fatigue may have contributed to the production of the
second peak of infected people observed in different parts of the world between 2020
and early 2021. But our model is very simple, which makes it have important
limitations to be applied in real scenarios. Although the model was developed for the
COVID-19 pandemic, it could be the starting point for studying quarantine fatigue in
potential future pandemics.
