Abstract
In the United States, from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to December 31,
2020, 341,199 deaths and more than 19,663,976 infections were recorded. Recent
literature establishes that communities with poverty-related health problems, such
as obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension, are more
susceptible to mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, controversial
public health policies implemented by the nation's political leaders have
highlighted the socioeconomic inequalities of minorities. Therefore, through
multivariate correlational analysis using machine learning techniques and
structural equations, we measure whether social determinants are associated with
increased infection and death from COVID-19 disease. The PLS least squares
regression analysis allowed identifying a significant impact between social
determinants and COVID-19 disease through a predictive value of R2 = .916, β =
.836, p =. 000 (t-value = 66,137) shows that for each unit of increase in social
determinants, COVID-19 disease increases by 91.6%. The clustering index used
for correlational analysis generated a new data set comprising three groups: C1
Republicans, C2 and C3 Democrats from California, New York, Texas, and
Florida. This analysis made it possible to identify the poverty variable as the
main risk factor related to the high rates of infection in Republican states and a
high positive correlation between the population not insured with a medical plan
and high levels of virus contagion in the states of group C3. These findings
explain the argument that poverty and lack of economic security put the public or
private health system at risk and calamity.

Introduction
Moral economics criticizes the contemporary economic model's current position, which
establishes the predominance of capital over human well-being and the criteria for
classifying ideological institutions considering some inferior human beings due to their
race, skin color, or religion (Bolton & Laaser, 2013).
These inequalities reflect vulnerable communities characterized by their housing
conditions, transportation, language barriers, population density, health conditions, and
medical care access (Smittenaar, 2020). Unfortunately, this population is more
vulnerable to increased exposure to SARS-CoV-2 contagion and specific health
considerations such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension (Patel et al., 2020).
From the beginning of the first infections until December 31, 2020, 341,199
people died in the United States, with more than 19,663,976 infected; this disease has a
tremendous impact on medical care and the economy. The National Institute of
Allergies and Infectious Diseases established guidelines that suggested the use of facial
protection, social distancing, early diagnosis, and the respective follow-up of those
infected as a strategy to contain transmission (Gremmels et al., 2020).
However, with great notoriety in the United States, the execution of public
health policies to face the pandemic has been limited to ideological confrontations of
the American bipartisanship, with deep inequalities that threaten the sense of justice,
equity, and morality (Hadjisolomou & Simone, 2020).
Therefore, based on the problem raised above, we pose the following research
question: Is poverty a risk factor attributed to the high infection rates and mortality from
the SARS-CoV-2 virus? Next, we will describe the study variables.

Classification and definition of the study variables

Social Determinants Factors (SDF)
•

Covid-19 community vulnerability factors index (CCIV) measures how a
community responds to the health, economic, and social consequences of virus.
The indicators that make up this index are housing conditions, transportation,
language barriers, population density, health conditions, and medical care
access.

Number of unemployed (UNEMP-20) measures the number of available people
who stopped working and are looking for work. This indicator comprises
unemployed persons who were available for work and made at least a specific
and active effort to find a job during the survey's reference week; they were
temporarily fired and expected to return to work. This indicator does not apply
to sick people.

rate for people without health insurance to help cover their medical expenses.

•

Estimate number of population (POP-20) measure the population estimate for

Contagions registered by Covid-19 (CS-COVID-19) measures the number of
infections due to SARS-CoV-2 or severe acute respiratory syndrome.

•

Death registered by Covid-19 (DE-COVID-19) measures the number of deaths
from SARS-CoV-2 or severe acute respiratory syndrome.

Theoretical framework
The economic nationalism and populist narrative
Liberal economic theorists have faced the challenges of economic nationalists and trade
protectionism that arise from the idea that economic activities should be subordinate to
the nation's economic objectives (Helleiner, 2002). In recent years, with globalization,
economic nationalism has changed so as not to disappear in the face of liberalism,
reinforcing the motto of classic protectionism and liberal economic nationalism (Clift &
Woll, 2012).

With the adoption of free trade, the development of new nationalist economic
projects in America and Europe linked to political populism (Scheuerman, 2019) has led
nations to move away from liberal economic policies through initiatives that promote
different socioeconomic restrictions within the free trade, reinforcing the strategy of
national autonomy through economic disintegration and deglobalization (Born et al.,
2019).
This populist narrative characterized by a discursive framework based on
different substantive ideological positions and an incoherent political agenda
(Bonikowski, 2016) focuses on "economic nationalism" influenced by conservative
proposals on issues of trade and international cooperation and immigration (Colantone
& Stanig, 2019).
These conservative proposals and their populist narrative reinforced by the
nationalists' militant individualism have led the United States of America to a profound
deterioration of its political ideology under Donald Trump's presidency (Diaz &
Mountz, 2020). The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on the
exponential wave of infections and deaths has revealed the problems of inequality and
poverty that affect thousands of American citizens.

The moral economy and social iniquity
Poverty is defined as the lack of sufficient income to satisfy basic needs; in the United
States, a person is poor when their income falls below a certain threshold of money,
which is determined by the Census Bureau of the United States (Census, 2020).
However, there is scientific evidence from studies that support the positive association
between low income, low socioeconomic status, and low educational level with health
conditions related to tobacco use, obesity, hypertension, cancer, and diabetes (Niessen
et al., 2018).

The framework of the "moral economy" allows us to reflect on comprehensive
organizational management policies and decisions where economic primacy is over
human well-being, especially during economic crises such as COVID-19 produced by
the severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS-CoV-2 (Hadjisolomou & Simone,
2020). Current political agendas have generated insecurity for many marginalized
minorities, which are part of a precarious labor system (Standing, 2016); the term
"precarious" is known as a generalized state of insecurity that has tangible effects on the
health of the individual (Harrison et al., 2020).

The SARS-CoV-2 and social vulnerability
SARS-CoV-2 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by the pathogen
(coronavirus 2) (Yao et al., 2020). This virus has a higher fatality rate among elderly
patients and patients with comorbidities (Chen & Li, 2020). Within the symptoms,
infected patients suffer from fever, dyspnoea, dry cough, pneumonia and fatigue
accompanied by various non-respiratory clinical characteristics, such as gastrointestinal
symptoms and eye inflammation (Hong et al., 2020).
According to studies carried out before the pandemic, socially and economically
disadvantaged people are groups of greater vulnerability for developing health
conditions (Cookson et al., 2016). Unfortunately, public policies have shown utter
disregard for vulnerable groups, exposing thousands of human beings to mortality for
decades (Marmot, 2005).
Unemployment is one of the biggest challenges in the COVID-19 pandemic, as
the time of unemployment lengthens certain factors such as declining savings, and the
limitations generated by unemployment insurance benefits wreak serious havoc in
society (Chodorow-Reich, 2020).

Concerning COVID-19, among the risk factors identified in these disadvantaged
groups is overcrowding in populated homes, which reduces compliance with social
distancing standards, being employed in occupations that do not provide stable income
or opportunities to work from home (Stewart, 2020).

Social determinants factors
Certain factors are critical in identifying the social determinants of health inequity, such
as racism (Johnson, 2020), low-income households (Rolfe et al., 2020) and problems
acquiring health plans (Weida et al., 2020). Therefore, the use of the COVID-19
Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI) will evaluate whether a community could
respond to the health, economic and social consequences of COVID-19.
These socioeconomic indicators measure vulnerabilities related to housing
conditions, transportation, language barriers, population density, health conditions, and
the population's access to medical care (Stewart, 2020). The scientific evidence
establishes that social disadvantage and vulnerability can influence the incidence of a
health emergency similar to that of COVID-19 (Melvin et al., 2020). Consequently,
poverty can not only increase exposure to the virus but also reduce the ability of the
immune system to fight it, since people with low income are a negative determinant for
access to medical care, this group being the highest risk mortality from COVID-19
(Patel et al., 2020). The discussion of the literature presented above allows us to propose
the hypothesis of this research:

H1:

Poverty as a determining social factor drives infection and death from the
SARS-CoV-2 virus disease.

Methodological design of the research
This research is quantitative - correlational, and it seeks to describe the relationship of
the study variables at a given time (Sampieri & Lucio, 2013) using multivariate analysis
statistics, clusters, and structural equations with partial least squares (Ajamieh, 2016)
through the implementation of a state political control matrix to determine the impact
relationships of social determinants in the COVID-19 disease.
The methodology was framed in the correlational-causal design because only the
level of correlation between the variables was measured to identify possible causalities
in the phenomenon that will later be studied (Orengo, 2008); The data used consisted of
408 observations structured in panel data obtained in the public repositories of the
United States government that described below:
•

The U.S. Census Bureau

•

National Conference of State Legislatures

•

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and

•

Surgo Foundation Ventures
The data panel allowed to identify systematic and unobserved differences

between the units correlated with factors whose effects should be measured
(Wooldridge, 2009). Also, they allowed the results to be generalized since this study
seeks to obtain from this population the data previously organized in tables
methodologically designed for such purposes (Census, 2020).

Political and geographical projection
In the United States, there are two political parties, the Democrats and the Republicans
(Rodden, 2010). However, as part of the study model, we identify and classify political

parties that control state governments and decide public health (Ahler & Broockman,
2015).
This study covers 50 states and the District of Columbia, which is the main
political and administrative unit (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2018). This
distribution does not include American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands,
Palau, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands

Data Analysis
In this study, 408 observations were analysed, organized into panel data; the process
and tools are detailed below:
•

The first analysis phase: reflective PLS model (Smart PLS 3.0)

•

The second analysis phase: clustering and correlation analysis (Orange 3.0
learning machine platform)

First analysis phase: reflective PLS model
For this first phase, a non-parametric reflective model of partial least squares PLS and
Bootstrapping is used since it is reliable and less sensitive to outliers. The model
consists of two constructs, and fifty indicators previously explained.
Figure 1. Research empirical model

Model evaluation
Before starting with the respective multivariate analysis; Hair et al. (2012); Martínez &
Fierro (2018a) establish the importance of their evaluation, which implies examining
the reliability, internal consistency, convergent, and discriminant validation. These
evaluations yielded the following results explained below.

The results obtained show construct reliability in the model since the tests
obtained values higher than p-value = .7. Regarding the convergent validation through
the test (AVE), we conclude that the set of indicators represents a single underlying
construct since values higher than p-value = .50 were obtained (Martínez & Fierro,
2018).
Therefore, each construct explains at least 50% of the variance of the indicators.
When evaluating the collinearity level, the test (VIF) did not find problems related to
collinearity since its values fluctuated at a p-value = 1.00. In the discriminant validity
test or the Forner-Larcker Criterion, results in less than 0.7 confirm the existence of
validity.

The model's predictive quality was performed using the Stone-Geisser
redundancy test of cross-validation of the construct or Q2, which assesses the structural
and theoretical model; with the results obtained with a value greater than zero 0, the
conclusion is drawn existence of predictive validity and relevance of the model
(Thaisaiyi, 2020).

Magnitude and significance of the model
Path coefficient results (β) and values (p)
The analysis of the PLS algorithm's magnitude and significance allows us to measure
and test the research model's respective hypothesis relationships. The magnitude is
observed in the standardized regression coefficient (β) and its significance (p). With the
Bootstrapping algorithm, the magnitude is observed in the standardized regression
coefficient (β), and the significance in the two-tailed t (4900) values; where the critical
value is (0.01; 4999) = 2,576 (Martínez & Fierro, 2018a). The resampling analysis
evaluated (5000 subsamples) with a confidence level of 0.05.

Results
The confirmatory analysis of the PLS least squares regression test establishes a high and
robust significant impact between social determinants factors and covid-19 disease
through a predictive value of R2 = .916, β = .836, p = .000 (t-value = 66.137). The
research showed that for every unit of increase in social determinants, COVID-19
disease increases by 91.6%.

Second analysis phase: correlational party-control analysis
We will use the K-Means method to meet our grouping criteria (the axiom of nonnegativity, identity, symmetry, and triangular inequality) of the data obtained in the two
political groups and the silhouette analysis with the Manhattan metric to define the
proximity of the study elements and identify the optimal value of k during the clustering
process.

Note: It shows a two-dimensional projection with data from the Republican (red) and
Democratic (blue) states, where the characteristics delineated by their respective vectors
are combined.
The correlational modeling between social determinants and covid-19 disease
also generated a new data set using the clustering index as a class attribute, which will
allow the identification of patterns and the detection of clusters (Leong & Yue, 2017).
It will also allow us to observe its constancy in time and meaning (Sabogal, 2013). The
data are composed of three groups C1 Republicans, C2 Democrats, C3 California, New
York, Texas, and Florida.

Note: Data on deaths from COVID-19 collected in different periods from January to
December 2020.
There is emerging evidence that establishes that risk conditions linked to
Poverty such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and hypertension are risk
factors for death from COVID-19; consequently, people with low socioeconomic status
are more susceptible to mortality from infection (Patel et al., 2020).

The findings show a high positive correlation between the uninsured population
with a health plan and high virus infection levels in California, Texas, New York, and
Florida. Finally, the results show a high positive correlation between Poverty and high
levels of COVID-19 infection than the other indicators that make up the Covid-19
Community Vulnerability Factors Index (CCIV), which explains the argument that
Poverty and lack of economic security puts a public or private health system at risk and
calamity (Weida et al., 2020).

Conclusions
In the last two presidential elections, the online strategies carried out by former
presidents Obama and Trump became visible in what has been called social media
elections (Shmargad & Sanchez, 2020). However, although both political parties
maintained an active presence on social media in the last elections of 2020, a pattern of
misinformation based on denial and conspiracy theories unleashed a lack of clear and
reliable public health policies.
In the first spectrum, state governors who downplayed the Center for Disease
Control and Prevention recommendations saw a disproportionate increase in infections
and deaths (CDC, 2019). The evidence shows that the risk factor is the population with
a lack of sufficient income to satisfy their basic needs. However, although
unemployment grew dramatically, the evidence establishes that the unemployed
population was not a risk factor. For this reason, it is necessary to deepen with more
exploratory studies that identify and evaluate the causes of the high mortality rates that
contrast with the poverty and coverage data of the medical plans of states such as New
York.
On a second spectrum, the government's responsibility to address the factors that
leave the most economically disadvantaged vulnerable to the virus, expanding the

coverage of government health plans and actively contributing to minimizing social
inequalities based on ethnic minority groups. The pandemic highlighted social and
economic inequalities within American society and is likely to exacerbate them by
considering more contagious variants, as there are high levels of transmission.
Consequently, the executive and legislative branches' correct political decisionmaking is relevant in the framework of public health, addressing the vulnerabilities of
the economically disadvantaged within American society with new, more inclusive
health policies to help millions of American citizens living below the poverty line.
