Abstract—The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) is spreading all over the world. Medical
imaging such as X-ray and computed tomography (CT)
plays an essential role in the global fight against COVID-19,
whereas the recently emerging artificial intelligence (AI)
technologies further strengthen the power of the imaging
tools and help medical specialists. We hereby review the
rapid responses in the community of medical imaging
(empowered by AI) toward COVID-19. For example,
AI-empowered image acquisition can significantly help
automate the scanning procedure and also reshape the
workflow with minimal contact to patients, providing the
best protection to the imaging technicians. Also, AI can
improve work efficiency by accurate delination of
infections in X-ray and CT images, facilitating subsequent
quantification. Moreover, the computer-aided platforms
help radiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease
diagnosis, tracking, and prognosis. In this review paper, we
thus cover the entire pipeline of medical imaging and
analysis techniques involved with COVID-19, including
image acquisition, segmentation, diagnosis, and follow-up.

I. INTRODUCTION

T

HE coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), is an ongoing pandemic. The number of
people infected by the virus is increasing rapidly. Up to April 5,
2020, 1,133,758 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in over
200 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 62,784
deaths (with a fatal rate of 5.54%) [1]. This has led to great
public health concern in the international community, as the
World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be
a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)
on January 30, 2020 and recognized it as a pandemic on March
11, 2020 [2, 3].
Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
test serves as the gold standard of confirming COVID-19
patients [4]. However, the RT-PCR assay tends to be
inadequate in many areas that have been severely hit especially
during early outbreaks of this disease. The lab test also suffers
from high false-negative rates, due to many factors, such as
sample preparation and quality control [5]. In clinical practice,
easily accessible imaging equipments, such as chest X-ray and
thoracic CT, provide huge assistance to clinicians [6-11].
Particularly in China, many cases were identified as suspected
of COVID-19, if characteristic manifestations in CT scans were
observed [5]. The suspected patients, even without clinical
symptoms (e.g., fever and coughing), were also hospitalized or
quarantined for further lab tests. Given the high false-positive
rate of the nucleic acid tests, many suspected patients have to be
tested multiple times several days apart before reaching a
confident diagnosis. Hence, the imaging findings play a critical
role in constraining the viral transmission and also fighting
against COVID-19.
The workflow of imaging-based diagnosis for COVID-19,
taking thoracic CT as an example, includes three stages in
general, i.e., 1) pre-scan preparation, 2) image acquisition, and
3) disease diagnosis. In the pre-scan preparation stage, each
subject is instructed and assisted by a technician to pose on the

2
patient bed according to a given protocol. In the image
acquisition stage, CT images are acquired during a single
breath-hold. The scan ranges from the apex to the lung base.
Scans are done from the level of the upper thoracic inlet to the
inferior level of the costophrenic angle with the optimized
parameters set by the radiologist(s), based on the patient’s body
shape. From the acquired raw data, CT images are
reconstructed and then transmitted through picture archiving
and communication systems (PACS) for subsequent reading
and diagnosis.
Artificial intelligence (AI), an emerging technology in the
field of medical imaging, has contributed actively to fight
COVID-19 [12]. Compared to the traditional imaging
workflow that heavily relies on the human labors, AI enables
more safe, accurate and efficient imaging solutions. Recent
AI-empowered applications in COVID-19 mainly include the
dedicated imaging platform, the lung and infection region
segmentation, the clinical assessment and diagnosis, as well as
the pioneering basic and clinical research. Moreover, many
commercial products have been developed, which successfully
integrate AI to combat COVID-19 and clearly demonstrate the
capability of the technology. The Medical Imaging Computing
Seminar (MICS) 1 , a China’s leading alliance of medical
imaging scholars and start-up companies, organized this first
online seminar on COVID-19 on Febuary 18, 2020, which
attracted more than ten thousands of visits. All the above
examples show the tremendous enthusiasm cast by the public
for AI-empowered progress in the medical imaging field,
especially during the ongoing pandemic.
Due to the importance of AI in all the spectrum of the
imaging-based analysis of COVID-19, this review aims to
extensively discuss the role of medical imaging, especially
empowered by AI, in fighting the COVID-19, which will
inspire future practical applications and methodological
research. In the following, we first introduce intelligent
imaging platforms for COVID-19, and then summarize popular
machine learning methods in the imaging workflow, including
segmentation, diagnosis and prognosis. Several publicly
available datasets are also introduced. Finally, we discuss
several open problems and challenges. We expect to provide
guidance for researchers and radiologists through this review.
Note that we review the most related medical-imaging-based
COVID-19 studies up to March 31, 2020.
II. AI-EMPOWERED CONTACTLESS IMAGING WORKFLOWS
Healthcare practitioners are particularly vulnerable
concerning the high risk of occupational viral exposure.
Imaging specialists and technicians are of high priority, such
that any potential contact with the virus could be under control.
In addition to the personal protective equipment (PPE), one
may consider dedicated imaging facilities and workflows,
which are significantly important to reduce the risks and save
lives.

A. Conventional Imaging Workflow
Chest X-ray and CT are widely used in the screening and
diagnosis of COVID-19 [6-11]. It is important to employ a
contactless and automated image acquisition workflow to avoid
the severe risks of infection during COVID-19 pandemic.
However, the conventional imaging workflow includes
inevitable contact between technicians and patients. Especially,
in patient positioning, technicians first assist in posing the
patient according to a given protocol, such as head-first versus
feet-first, and supine versus prone in CT, followed by visually
identifying the target body part location on the patient and
manually adjusting the relative position and pose between the
patient and the X-ray tube. This process puts the technicians in
close contact with the patients, which leads to high risks of viral
exposure. Thus, a contactless and automated imaging workflow
is needed to minimize the contact.
B. AI-Empowered Imaging Workflow
Many modern X-ray and CT systems are equipped with
cameras for patient monitoring purposes [13-16]. During the
outbreak of COVID-19, those devices provided chance to
establish a contactless scanning workflow. Technicians can
monitor the patient from the control room via a live video
stream from the camera. However, from only the overhead
view of the camera, it is still challenging for the technician to
determine the scanning parameters such as scan range. In this
case, AI is able to automate the process [17-25] by identifying
the pose and shape of the patient from the data acquired with
visual sensors such as RGB, Time-of-Flight (TOF) pressure
imaging [26] or thermal (FIR) cameras. Thus, the optimal
scanning parameters can be determined.
One typical scanning parameter that can be estimated with
AI-empowered visual sensors is the scan range that defines the
starting and ending positions of the CT scan. Scan range can be
identified by detecting anatomical joints of the subject from the
images. Much recent work [27-29] has focused on estimating
the 2D [30-35] or 3D keypoint locations [28, 36-39] on the
patient body. These keypoint locations usually include major
joints such as the neck, shoulders, elbows, ankles, wrists, and
knees. Wang et al. [40] has shown that such an automated
workflow can significantly improve scanning efficiency and
reduce unnecessary radiation exposure. However, such
keypoints usually represent only a very sparse sampling of the
full 3D mesh [41] in the 3D space (that defines the digital
human body).
Other important scanning parameters can be inferred by AI,
including ISO-centering. ISO-centering refers to aligning the
target body region of the subject, so that the center of the target
body region overlaps with the scanner ISO center and thus the
overall imaging quality is optimal. Studies have shown that,
with better ISO-centering, radiation dosage can be reduced
while maintaining similar imaging quality [42]. In order to
align the target body region to the ISO center, and given that
anatomical keypoints usually represent only a very sparse
sampling of the full 3D mesh in the 3D space (defining the
digital human body), Georgakis et al. [43] propose to recover
human mesh from a single monocular RGB image using a

3
parametric human model SMPL [44]. Unlike other related
studies [45], they employ a hierarchical kinematic reasoning for
each kinematic chain of the patient to iteratively refine the
estimation of each anatomical keypoint to improve the system
robustness to clutters and partial occlusions around the joints of
the patient. Singh et al. [18] present a technique, using depth
sensor data, to retrieve a full 3D patient mesh by fitting the
depth data to a parametric human mesh model based on
anatomical landmarks detected from RGB image. One recent
solution proposed by Ren et al. [41] learns a model that can be
trained just once and have the capability to be applied across
multiple such applications based on dynamic multi-modal
inference.
With this framework in application with an RGB-depth input
sensor, even if one of the sensor modalities fails, the model
above can still perform 3D patient body inference with the
remaining data.
C. Applications in COVID-19
During the outbreak of COVID-19, several essential
contactless imaging workflows were established[17, 40, 41],
from the utilization of monitoring cameras in the scan room
[13-15, 27], or on the device [46], to mobile CT platforms [17,
46-49] with better access to patients and flexible installation.
A notable example is an automated scanning workflow based
on a mobile CT platform empowered by visual AI technologies
[17], as shown in Fig. 1(a). The mobile platform is fully
self-contained with an AI-based pre-scan and diagnosis system
[46]. It was redesigned into a fully isolated scan room and
control room. Each room has its own entrance to avoid any
unnecessary interaction between technicians and patients.
After entering the scan room, the patient is instructed, by
visual and audio prompts, to pose on the patient bed (Fig. 1(b)).
Technicians can observe through the window and also the live
video transmitted from the ceiling-mounted AI camera in the
scan room, and correct the pose of the patient if necessary (Fig.

1(c)). Once the patient is deemed ready, either by the technician
or the motion analysis algorithm, the patient positioning
algorithm will automatically recover the 3D pose and
fully-reconstructed mesh of the patient from the images
captured with the camera [41]. Based on the 3D mesh, both the
scan range and the 3D centerline of the target body part of the
patient are estimated and converted into control signals and
optimized scanning parameters for the technician to verify. If
necessary, the technician can make adjustments. Once verified,
the patient bed will be automatically aligned to ISO center and
moved into CT gantry for scanning. After CT images are
acquired, they will be processed and analyzed for screening and
diagnosis purposes.
III. AI IN IMAGE SEGMENTATION
Segmentation is an essential step in AI-based COVID-19
image processing and analysis. It delineates the regions of
interest (ROIs), e.g., lung, lobes, bronchopulmonary segments,
and infected regions or lesions, in the chest X-ray or CT images
for further assessment and quantification.
CT provides high-quality 3D images for detecting
COVID-19. To segment ROIs in CT, deep learning methods are
widely used. The popular segmentation networks for
COVID-19 include classic U-Net [50-55], UNet++ [56, 57],
VB-Net [58]. Compared with CT, X-ray is more easily
accessible around the world. However, due to the ribs projected
onto soft tissues in 2D and thus confounding image contrast, the
segmentation of X-ray images is even more challenging.
Currently, there is no method developed for segmenging X-ray
images for COVID-19. However, Gaal et al. [59] adopt an
Attention-U-Net for lung segmentation in X-ray images for
pneumonia, and although the research is not specified for
COVID-19, the method can be applied to the diagnosis of
COVID-19 and other diseases easily.
Although now there are limited segmentation works directly
related to COVID-19 , many papers consider segmentation as a

necessary process in analyzing COVID-19. Table I summarizes
representative works involving image segmentation in
COVID-19 studies.
A. Segmentation of Lung Regions and Lesions
In terms of target ROIs, the segmentation methods in
COVID-19 applications can be mainly grouped into two
categories, i.e., the lung-region-oriented methods and the
lung-lesion-oriented methods. The lung-region-oriented
methods aim to separate lung regions, i.e., whole lung and lung
lobes, from other (background) regions in CT or X-ray, which
is considered as a pre-requisite step in COVID-19 applications
[50-54, 57, 58, 60]. For example, Jin et al. [57] propose a
two-stage pipeline for screening COVID-19 in CT images, in
which the whole lung region is first detected by an efficient
segmentation
network
based
on
UNet++.
The
lung-lesion-oriented methods aim to separate lesions (or metal
and motion artifacts) in the lung from lung regions [51-58, 60,
61]. Because the lesions or nodules could be small with a
variety of shapes and textures, locating the regions of the

Quantification

lesions or nodules is required and has often been considered a
challenging detection task. Notably, in addition to
segmentation, the attention mechanism is reported as an
efficient localization method in screening [59], which can be
adopted in COVID-19 applications.
B. Segmentation Methods
In the literature, there have been numerous techniques for
lung segmentation with different purposes [63-67]. The U-Net
is a commonly used technique for segmenting both lung regions
and lung lesions in COVID applications [50-53]. The U-Net, a
type of fully convolutional network proposed by Ronneberger
[68], has a U-shape architecture with symmetric encoding and
decoding signal paths. The layers of the same level in two paths
are connected by the shortcut connections. In this case, the
network can therefore learn better visual semantics as well as
detailed contextures, which is suitable for medical image
segmentation.
Various U-Net and its variants have been developed,
achieving reasonable segmentation results in COVID-19

5
applications. Çiçek et al. [63] propose the 3D U-Net that uses
the inter-slice information by replacing the layers in
conventional U-Net with a 3D version. Milletari et al. [64]
propose the V-Net which utilizes the residual blocks as the
basic convolutional block, and optimize the network by a Dice
loss. By equipping the convolutional blocks with the so-called
bottleneck blocks, Shan et al. [58] use a VB-Net for more
efficient segmentation. Zhou et al. [65] propose the UNet++,
which is much more complex than U-Net, as the network
inserts a nested convolutional structure between the encoding
and decoding path. Obviously, this type of network can
improve the performance of segmentation. However, it is more
difficult to train. This network is also used for locating lesions
in COVID-19 diagnosis [56]. Recently advanced attention
mechanisms can learn the most discriminant part of the features
in the network. Oktay et al. [67] propose an Attention U-Net
that is capable of capturing fine structures in medical images,
thereby suitable for segmenting lesions and lung nodules in
COVID-19 applications.
Training a robust segmentation network requires sufficient
labeled data. In COVID-19 image segmentation, adequate
training data for segmentation tasks is often unavailable since
manual delineation for lesions is labor-intensive and
time-consuming. To address this, a straightforward method is
to incorporate human knowledge. For example, Shan et al. [58]
integrate human-in-the-loop strategy into the training of a
VB-net based segmentation network, which involves
interactivity with radiologists into the training of the network.
Qi et al. [53] delineate the lesions in the lung using U-Net with
the initial seeds given by a radiologist. Several other works
used diagnostic knowledge and identified the infection regions
by the attention mechanism [57]. Weakly-supervised machine
learning methods are also used when the training data are
insufficient for segmentation. For example, Zheng et al. [50]
propose to use an unsupervised method to generate pseudo
segmentation masks for the images. As lacking of annotated
medical images is common in lung segmentation, unsupervised
and semi-supervised methods are highly demanded for
COVID-19 studies.
C. Applications in COVID-19
Segmentation can be used in various COVID-19 applications,
among which diagnosis is frequently reported [50, 54-57, 69,
70]. For example, Li et al. [55] use U-Net for lung
segmentation in a multi-center study for distinguishing
COVID-19 from community-acquired pneumonia on Chest CT.
Jin et al. propose an AI system for fast COVID-19 diagnosis
[57]. The input to the classification model is the CT slices that
have been segmented by a segmentation network.
Another application of image segmentation is quantification
[51-53, 58, 60, 61], which further serves for many medical
applications. For example, Shan et al. [58] propose a VB-Net
for segmentation of lung, lung lobes and lung infection, which
provide accurate quantification data for medical studies,
including quantitative assessment of progression in the
follow-up, comprehensive prediction of severity in the

enrollment, and visualization of lesion distribution using
percentage of infection (POI). Cao et al. [51] assess
longitudinal progression of COVID-19 by using voxel-level
deep learning-based CT segmentation of pulmonary opacities.
Huang et al. [52] segment lung region and GGO for
quantitative evaluation, which is further used for monitoring
the progression of COVID-19. Qi et al. segment lung lesions of
COVID-19 patients using a U-Net based algorithm, and extract
radiomics features for predicting hospital stay [53].
In summary, image segmentation plays an important role
in COVID-19 applications, i.e., in lung delineation and lesion
measurement. It facilitates radiologists in accurately
identification of lung infection and prompting quantitative
analysis and diagnosis of COVID-19.
IV. AI-ASSISTED DIAGNOSIS
In outbreak areas, patients suspected of COVID-19 are in
urgent need of diagnosis and proper treatment. Due to fast
acquisition, X-ray and CT scans are widely performed to
provide evidences for radiologists. However, medical images,
especially chest CT, contain hundreds of slices, which takes a
long time for the specialists to diagnose. Also, COVID-19 as a
new disease has similar manifestations with various other types
of pneumonia, which requires radiologists to accumulate many
experiences for achieving a high diagnostic performance. Thus,
AI-assisted diagnosis using medical images is highly desired.
Table II lists the most relevant state-of-the-art studies on this
direction.
A. X-ray based Screening of COVID-19
X-ray images are generally considered less sensitive than 3D
chest CT images, despite being the typical first-line imaging
modality used for patients under investigation of COVID-19. A
recent study reported that X-ray shows normal in early or mild
disease [71]. In particular, abnormal chest radiographs are
found in 69% of the patients at the initial time of admission, and
in 80% of the patients some time after during hospitalization
[71].
Radiological signs include airspace opacities, ground-glass
opacity (GGO), and later consolidation. Bilateral, peripheral,
and lower zone predominant distributions are mostly observed
(90%). Pleural effusion is rare (3%) in comparison to
parenchymal abnormalities [71].
Classification of COVID-19 from other pneumonia and
healthy subjects have been explored. Ghoshal et al. [72]
propose a Bayesian Convolutional Neural network to estimate
the diagnosis uncertainty in COVID-19 prediction. 70 lung
X-ray images of patients with COVID-19 are obtained from an
online COVID-19 dataset [73], and non-COVID-19 images are
obtained from Kaggle’s Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia).
The experimental results show that Bayesian inference
improves detection accuracy of the standard VGG16 model
from 85.7% to 92.9%. The authors further generate saliency
maps to illustrate the locations focused by the deep network, to
improve the understanding of deep learning results and
facilitate a more informed decision-making process.

Narin et al. [9] propose three different deep learning models,
i.e., ResNet50, InceptionV3, and Inception-ResNetV2, to
detect COVID-19 infection from X-ray images. It is worth
noting that the COVID-19 dataset [73] and Kaggle’s Chest
X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) are also used to form the dataset in
this study. Chest X-ray images of 50 COVID-19 patients and 50
normal chest X-ray images are included. The evaluation results
show that the ResNet50 model achieves the highest
classification performance with 98.0% accuracy, compared to
97.0% accuracy by InceptionV3 and 87% accuracy by
Inception-ResNetV2.
Zhang et al. [74] present a ResNet based model to detect
COVID-19 from X-ray images. This model has two tasks, i.e.,
one task for the classification between COVID-19 and
non-COVID-19, and another task for anomaly detection. The
anomaly detection task gives an anomaly score to optimize the
COVID-19 score used for the classification. X-ray images from
70 COVID-19 patients and 1008 non-COVID-19 pneumonia
patients are included from these two datasets. The sensitivity
and specificity are 96.0% and 70.7%, respectively, along with
an AUC of 0.952.
Also, Wang et al. [11] propose a deep convolutional neural
network based model (COVID-Net) to detect COVID-19 cases
using X-ray images. Similarly, from these two datasets, the
dataset includes 5941 chest X-ray images from 1203 healthy
people, 931 patients with bacterial pneumonia, 660 patients
with viral pneumonia, and 45 patients with COVID-19. The
COVID-Net obtains the testing accuracy of 83.5%.
In general, most current studies use X-ray images to classify
between COVID-19 and other pneumonia and healthy subjects.
The images are mainly from two online datasets, in which there
are only 70 images from COVID-19 patients. With this limited
number of COVID-19 images, it is insufficient to evaluate the
robustness of the methods and also poses questions to the
generalizability with respect to applications in other clinical
centers. Also, the severity of subjects remain unknown; the
future work could emphasize on early detection of COVID-19.
B. CT-based Screening and Severity Assessment of COVID-19
Dynamic radiological patterns in chest CT images of
COVID-19 have been reported and summarized as 4 stages [79].
Briefly, 0-4 days after onset of the initial symptom is
considered as the early stage. GGO could be observed
subpleurally in the lower lobes unilaterally or bilaterally. The
progressive stage is 5-8 days where diffuse GGO, crazy-paving
pattern, and even consolidation could be found distributing in
bilateral multi-lobes. In the peak stage (9-13 days), dense
consolidation becomes more prevalent. When the infection
becomes controlled, the absorption stage appears (usually after
14 days). Consolidation and crazy-paving pattern are gradually
absorbed and only GGO is left. These radiological patterns
provide important evidences for CT-based classification and
severity assessment of COVID-19.
1) Classification of COVID-19 from non-COVID-19. There
are a number of studies aiming to separate COVID-19 patients
from non-COVID-19 subjects (that include common
pneumonia subjects and non-pneumonia subjects). Chen et al.

[56] employ chest CT images from 51 COVID-19 patients and
55 patients with other diseases to train a UNet++ based
segmentation model. This model is responsible for segmenting
COVID-19 related lesions. The final label (COVID-19 or nonCOVID-19) is determined based on the segmented lesions. The
evaluation results of COVID-19 classification using the
proposed model are 95.2% (Accuracy), 100% (Sensitivity), and
93.6% (Specificity). In an additional dataset including 16 viral
pneumonia and 11 non-pneumonia patients, the proposed
model could identify all the viral pneumonia patients and 9 of
non-pneumonia patients. The reading time of radiologists is
shortened by 65% with the help of AI results.
A U-Net+3D CNN based model (DeCoVNet) is proposed in
[50]. The U-Net is used for lung segmentation, and the
segmentation result is used as the input of the 3D CNN for
predicting the probability of COVID-19. Chest CT images of
540 subjects (i.e., 313 with COVID-19, and 229 without
COVID-19) are used as training and testing data. The proposed
model achieves a sensitivity of 90.7%, specificity of 91.1%,
and AUC of 0.959.
Jin et al. [69] use chest CT images from 496 COVID-19
positive cases and 1385 negative cases. A 2D CNN based
model is proposed to segment the lung and then identify slices
of positive COVID-19 cases. Experimental results show that
the proposed model achieves sensitivity of 94.1%, specificity
of 95.5%, and AUC of 0.979.
In another work, Jin et al. [57] include chest CT images of
1136 cases (i.e., 723 COVID-19 positives, and 413 COVID-19
negatives) in the study. Their proposed model contains a
UNet++ based segmentation model and a ResNet50 based
classification model. The segmentation model is used to
highlight lesion regions for the classification model. In the
experiment, the sensitivity and specificity using the proposed
UNet++ and ResNet50 combined model are 97.4% and 92.2%,
respectively.
2) Classification of COVID-19 from other pneumonia.
Given that the common pneumonia especially viral pneumonia
has similar radiological appearances with COVID-19, their
differentiation would be more useful in facilitating the
screening process in clinical practice. Thus, a CNN model is
proposed in [75] to classify between COVID-19 and typical
viral pneumonia. Chest CT images from 99 patients (i.e., 44
COVID-19 and 55 typical viral pneumonia) are used. Slices
derived from each 3D CT image are used as the input of the
proposed CNN. The testing dataset shows a total accuracy of
73.1%, along with a specificity of 67.0% and a sensitivity of
74.0%.
Ying et al. [70] proposea deep learning-based CT diagnosis
system (called DeepPneumonia, using ResNet50) to detect
patients with COVID-19 from bacteria pneumonia patients and
healthy people. Chest CT images from 88 patients with
COVID-19, 101 patients with bacterial pneumonia, and 86
healthy persons are used as training and testing data. Slices of
complete lungs are derived from chest CT images, which are
the inputs of DeepPneumonia. The model achieves promising
results with an accuracy of 86.0% for pneumonia classification
(COVID-19 or bacterial pneumonia), and an accuracy of 94.0%

8
for pneumonia diagnosis (COVID-19 or healthy).
Xu et al. [76] use chest CT images from 219 patients with
COVID-19, 224 patients with Influenza-A, and 175 healthy
persons. A deep learning model based on V-Net is first used to
segment out the candidate infection regions. The patches of
infection regions are sent to the Resnet-18 network together
with features of relative infection distance from edge, and the
output is one of these three groups. The model achieves an
overall accuracy of 86.7%.
Li et al. [55] used a large chest CT dataset, which contains
4356 chest CT images (i.e., 1296 COVID-19, 1735
community-acquired pneumonia, and 1325 non-pneumonia)
from 3322 patients. A ResNet50 model (COVNet) is used on
2D slices with shared weights and combined with max-pooling
to discriminate COVID-19 from community-acquired
pneumonia (CAP) and non-pneumonia. Results show a
sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 96%, and AUC of 0.96 in
identifying COVID-19.
Shi et al. [77] employed chest CT images of 2685 patients, of
which 1658 patients are of COVID-19 and 1027 patients are of
common pneumonia. In the preprocessing stage, a VB-Net [58]
is adopted to segment the image into the left/right lung, 5 lung
lobes, and 18 pulmonary segments. A number of hand-crafted
features are calculated and used to train a random forest model.
Experimental results show a sensitivity of 90.7%, specificity of
83.3%, and accuracy of 87.9%. Also, testing results are
grouped based on infection sizes, showing that patients with
small infections have low sensitivity to be identified.
3) Severity assessment of COVID-19. Besides early
screening, the study of severity assessment is also important for
treatment planning. Tang et al. [78] proposed an RF-based
model for COVID-19 severity assessment (non-severe or
severe). Chest CT images of 176 patients with conformed
COVID-19 is used. A deep learning method VB-Net [77] is
adopted to divide the lung into anatomical sub-regions (e.g.,
lobes and segments), based on which infection volumes and
ratios of each anatomical sub-region are calculated and used as
quantitative features to train a RF model. Results show a true
positive rate of 93.3%, true negative rate of 74.5%, and
accuracy of 87.5%.
In summary, a variety of studies have been proposed for
CT-based COVID-19 diagnosis with generally promising
results. In the next step, the research on screening of
COVID-19 could facilitate early detection to help with the
diagnosis uncertainty of radiologists. Also, the prediction of
severity is of great importance that could help the estimation of
the ICU event or clinical decision of treatment planning, which
warrants more investigation.
V. AI IN FOLLOW-UP STUDIES
With the goal of evaluating the patient’s response and
investigating their potential problems after clinical treatment,
the follow-up step plays a significant role in COVID-19
treatment. Regarding the long incubation period of COVID-19
and its popular infectivity, to design the procedure of
AI-empowered follow-up for COVID-19 is challenging.
As most of the current works focus on the pre-diagnosis of

COVID-19, we notice that the works for studying the follow-up
for COVID-19 are still very limited. There are only few
attempts according to our knowledge. For example, the
researchers of Shanghai United Imaging Intelligence (UII)
attempt to use the machine learning-based method and
visualization techniques to demonstrate the change of the
volume size, density, and other clinical related factors in the
infection regions of the patient. After that, the clinical report is
automatically generated to reflect these changes as a
data-driven guidance for clinical specialists to determine the
following procedure (Fig. 2). In addition, the team from
Perception Vision Company (PVmed) provided another
follow-up solution for COVID-19. They tried to build a
contrastive model to reflect the change of different CT images
of the same patient, by aligning the infection regions and
observing the changing trend of these quantitative values.
Several other companies and institutes are also developing the
follow-up function in their software platforms currently.
Subsidiarily, Huang et al. [52] collect and analyze 126 patients
by calculating the CT lung opacification percentage. They find
the quantification of lung involvement could be employed to
reflect the disease progression of COVID-19, which is helpful
for the follow-up study.
It is worth noting that clinical specialists are taking their
efforts to the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. Thus, the
works for studying the follow-up of COVID-19 are still in the
early stage and remain an open issue. We believe the previous
techniques and work developed in segmentation, diagnosis,
quantification, and assessment could be used to guide the
development of AI-empowered follow-up study for
COVID-19.
VI. PUBLIC IMAGING DATASETS FOR COVID-19
Data collection is the first step to develop machine learning
methods for COVID-19 applications. Although there exist
large public CT or X-ray datasets for lung diseases, both X-ray
and CT scans for COVID-19 applications are not widely
available at present, which greatly hinders the research and
development of AI methods. Recently, several works on
COVID-19 data collection have been reported.
Cohen et al. [73] creates COVID-19 Image Data Collection
by assembling medical images from websites and publications,
and it currently contains 123 frontal view X-rays. The
COVID-CT dataset [80] includes 288 CT slices for COVID-19
confirmed cases thus far. It is collected from over 700
preprinted literature on COVID-19 from medRxiv and bioRxiv.
The Coronacases Initiative also shares confirmed cases of
COVID-19 on the website (https://coronacases.org). Currently,
it includes 3D CT images of 10 confirmed COVID-19 cases.
Also,
the
COVID-19
CT
segmentation
dataset
(http://medicalsegmentation.com/covid19/) contains 100 axial
CT slices from 60 patients with manual segmentations, in the
form of JPG images. It is worth noting that the current public
datasets still have a very limited number of images for training
and testing of AI algorithms, and the quality of datasets is not
sufficient .

VII. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK
AI has been successfully applied to the entire pipeline of the
imaging-based diagnosis of COVID-19. However, there are
still many works to be conducted in the future.
As mentioned, AI-empowered image acquisition workflows
have proven to make the scanning procedure not only more
efficient, but also effective in protecting medical staffs from
COVID-19 infection. Looking ahead, it is expected that more
AI-empowered applications will be integrated into the image
acquisition workflow, to facilitate better scan quality and
reduced radiation dosage consumed by patients. For example,
more precise AI-based automated ISO-centering and scan
range determination are required to ensure optimal image
quality. Moreover, X-ray exposure parameters can be
automatically calculated and optimized with AI inferred body
region thickness of the patient, ensuring that just the right
amount of radiation is used during the scan, which is
particularly important for low-dose imaging.
Medical images usually show negative radiological signs in
the early stage of the disease, and thus the study of this stage is
important to assist with the clinical diagnosis uncertainty.
Meanwhile, many current AI studies for segmentation and
diagnosis are based on small samples, which may lead to the
overfitting of results. To make the results clinically useful, the
quality and number of data need to be further improved.
Therefore, more datasets should be built to include the
clinically collected X-ray and CT images.
Deep learning has become the dominant approach in fighting
against COVID-19. However, the imaging data in COVID-19
applications may have incomplete, inexact and inaccurate
labels, which provides a challenge for training an accurate
segmentation and diagnostic network. In this way, weakly
supervised deep learning methods could be leveraged. Further,
manually labeling imaging data is expensive and
time-consuming, which also encourages the investigation of

self-supervised deep learning and transfer-deep-learning
methods. Multi-center studies on COVID-19 should also be
promoted.
Follow-up is critical in diagnosing COVID-19 and evaluating
treatment. Although there are still limited studies, we believe
that the methods from other related studies could be borrowed.
1) In the prognosis of other pneumonia diseases, machine
learning-based methodology could inspire the follow-up study
of COVID-19 [81-84]. 2) The follow-up inside and outside of
hospitals could be combined as a long period tracking for the
COVID patients. 3) Multidisciplinary integration, i.e., medical
imaging [85], natural language processing [86], and oncology
and fusion [86], could benefit the overall follow-up procedure
of measurement for COVID-19.
VIII. CONCLUSION
The COVID-19 is a disease that has spread all over the world.
Intelligent medical imaging has played an important role in
fighting against COVID-19. This paper discusses how AI
provides safe, accurate and efficient imaging solutions in
COVID-19 applications. The intelligent imaging platforms,
clinical diagnosis, and pioneering research are reviewed in
detail, which covers the entire pipeline of AI-empowered
imaging applications in COVID-19. Two imaging modalities,
i.e., X-ray and CT, are used to demonstrates the effectiveness of
AI-empowered medical imaging for COVID-19.
It is worth noting that imaging only provides partial
information about patients with COVID-19. It is important to
combine imaging data with clinical manifestations and
laboratory examination results to help the screening, detection
and diagnosis of COVID-19. In this case, we believe AI will
demonstrate its capability in fusing information from these
multi-source data, for performing accurate and efficient
diagnosis, analysis and follow-up.
