Abstract The main goal of this work is to estimate the actual number of cases of
Covid-19 in Spain in the period 01-31-2020 / 06-01-2020 by Autonomous Communities. Based on these estimates, this work allows us to accurately re-estimate the
lethality of the disease in Spain, taking into account unreported cases. A hierarchical
Bayesian model recently proposed in the literature has been adapted to model the
actual number of Covid-19 cases in Spain. The results of this work show that the real
load of Covid-19 in Spain in the period considered is well above the data registered
by the public health system. Specifically, the model estimates show that, cumulatively
until June 1st, 2020, there were 2,425,930 cases of Covid-19 in Spain with characteristics similar to those reported (95% credibility interval: 2,148,261 2,813,864),
from which were actually registered only 518,664. Considering the results obtained
from the second wave of the Spanish seroprevalence study, which estimates 2,350,324

cases of Covid-19 produced in Spain, in the period of time considered, it can be seen
that the estimates provided by the model are quite good. This work clearly shows
the key importance of having good quality data to optimize decision-making in the
critical context of dealing with a pandemic.

1 Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the family of betacoronavirus and has been identified as the
cause of Covid-19 disease, which can affect the lower respiratory tract and in some
cases progress to pneumonia in humans. In particular, it has been identified as the
causative agent of an unprecedented outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan City, province
of Hubei in China starting in December 2019[1] and spreading rapidly all over the
world and being declared as a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) on
2020 March 11th. Considering that many cases run without developing symptoms
beyond those of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV or pneumonia due to other causes, it is
reasonable to assume that the incidence of this disease has been under-registered, especially at the beginning of the outbreak.[2] Similarly, as many other countries health
systems were stressed to the limit of their capacity by the pandemic, it became clear
that providing researchers and general public with reliable data was almost impossible. Spain is, to the date, among the most affected European countries in terms of
number of registered cases, hospitalizations and deaths and there has been a debate
to what extent officially reported data can be trusted.[3] This work aims to estimate
the real burden of Covid-19 in Spain by Autonomous Community (CCAA), considering the data officially reported by the Spanish Ministry of Health (which has been
reported by each CCAA health department) and to compare these estimates to the results provided by the second wave of the seroprevalence study conducted from May
18th to June 1st.[4] In this study, 63,564 participants were recruited with a participation rate among eligible individuals around 66.5%. Globally, the estimated prevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-Cov-2 in Spain is around 5.2% (95%CI: 4.6%
- 5.4%).

2 Methods
A new Bayesian hierarchical framework to analyze potentially under-reported count
data was recently introduced.[5] It was originally used to estimate unreported cases
of tuberculosis in Brasil, but we have adapted it to use it in the context of Covid-19
disease in Spain by CCAA. A limitation of this methodology is that the spatial effect can only be estimated on regions with at least one neighbor, so isolated CCAA
cannot be included (Islas Baleares, Canarias, Ceuta and Melilla), although the incidence of the disease in these regions is much smaller than in peninsular ones. All
Covid-19 cases reported by the Spanish Ministry of Health through the Instituto de
Salud Carlos III by CCAA in the period 01-31-2020 to 06-01-2020 accessed by July

24th, 2020 (the data are being updated retrospectively as new information for some
CCAA is available) were included in this work. The model allows for the inclusion
of covariates on the true count-generating process and on the underreporting mechanism as well. Average, minimum and maximum temperature per CCAA and day (as
reported by the Agencia Estatal de Meteorologa[6]) were included to evaluate their
potential impact on the number of Covid-19 cases as well as an indicator for the nonpharmaceutical interventions undertaken by the Spanish government (no intervention
until March 15th, declaration of the emergency state from March 16th to March 30th
and from April 13th to June 1st, mandatory confinement from March 31st to April
12th). Number of PCR and antibodies tests were included as covariates that might
have an impact on the underreporting mechanism. Technical details are available in
Appendix A.

3 Results
It can be seen that the number of registered cases represent only a small fraction of
the actual burden of the disease in all CCAA (Fig. 1). These unreported cases can
be interpreted as asymptomatic or with mild symptoms or even cases with similar
clinical characteristics than those that were registered, and the causes for un-reporting
might be multiple -patients with unusual symptoms could have been misdiagnosed,
limit stress of the public health system at some points of time, among others.

By considering these unreported cases as well, it can be seen that the estimates
found in this study are very similar to the results provided by the seroprevalence
study conducted in Spain[4] and that in most CCAA the projection of seroprevalence
study yields 95% confidence intervals with non-empty intersection with 95% credible
intervals (CrI) provided by the present study, as can be seen in Table 1.
Having accurate estimates for the actual number of cases is also useful to estimate lethality associated to the disease, as it seems to be overestimated in Spain
when using the officially reported cases compared to lethality estimated in other
countries. Estimates for each CCAA and Spain are provided in Table 2, and it can
be seen that they are much more consistent with those reported in countries with
similar characteristics[7], all the cases being around 1% instead of values as high as
6.84% in Castilla La Mancha when using only registered data. The overall estimate
for Covid-19 lethality in Spain is 1.10% (95% CrI: 0.95% - 1.25%).
The impact of the considered covariates on the actual Covid-19 incidence is
shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen (right bottom) that the incidence rate is increasing
until the declaration of the emergency state (1.0) and then decreasing drastically. Regarding the temperature effect, there is no clear pattern. Maximum and minimum
temperature seem to have no effect on the Covid-19 incidence, while the decreasing incidence that can be seen when the average temperature increases disappeared
in a sensitivity analysis replacing non-pharmacological interventions by a sequential indicator of time as covariate. Therefore, temperature is probably acting just as a
confusing factor here.

3.1 Model checking
The goodness of fit of the proposed model can be checked by obtaining predictions
for the registered values and comparing them to the actual registered values. Fig. 4
shows this comparison for each CCAA, and it can be seen that predicted and actually
registered values are very similar (perfect fit would be over the diagonal).

The goodness of fit of the model can also be assessed by checking whether summary statistics of the registered data are fitted properly by the model through replicates. In particular, Fig. 5 shows how sample mean and variance are captured by the
model, comparing the prior (top) and posterior (bottom) predictive distributions of
both sample statistics and the mean squared error. It can be seen that the uncertainty
in the parameters has been reduced considerably by the data, as the posterior predictive distribution are notably more precise than the corresponding priors, meaning that
the model is fitting the data well.

4 Discussion
Dealing with under-reported data is very common in several fields including epidemiology, biomedical and social research among many others. It is known that predictions based on under-reported data might be severely biased if this issue is not
taken into account at the modeling stage.[8] This is especially important when dealing with diseases with a huge number of asymptomatic cases, as the Covid-19, where
the proportion of infected individuals developing no symptoms can be as high as 4045%.[9] This concern has received a lot of attention recently in the biomedical and
methodological literature, and several proposals have been done in order to model
under-reported data, from Markov chain Monte Carlo methods[10] to time series
analysis.[8, 11]
This work shows that Covid-19 cases in Spain are severely under-reported and
that an estimation of the unreported cases consistent with the results provided by the
second wave of a nationwide seroprevalence study[4] can be achieved by means of
a hierarchical Bayesian methodology proposed very recently.[5] The results of this
study also show that non-pharmaceutical interventions undertaken by the Spanish
government had a significant impact on Covid-19 incidence, as a monotonous decrease in the disease incidence following the implantation of mobility restrictions can
clearly be seen. No impact of temperature could have been detected, as the apparent
decrease in Covid-19 incidence for higher average temperatures was better explained
by the sequential pass of time. The methodology also allows for the inclusion of covariates that might explain the under-reporting mechanism, and so, it can provide
public health decision-makers with ways of improving the way data are registered.

David Moriña et al.

In this case, it can be seen that the more PCR and antibodies tests are conducted, the
more likely is to report a case.
It is important to notice that the considerable differences in coincidence between
the estimated number of cases provided by the Bayesian methodology and the seroprevalence study can be partially explained by the differences in how CCAA reported
their data to the Spanish Ministry of Health. Some of them reported prevalent cases
and some included, at least lately, asymptomatic cases tested positive while others reported only cases that required some kind of medical attention, so asymptomatic and
some mild symptoms cases might be missing in the data provided by these regions.
One of the lessons that should certainly be learned from the current Covid-19
pandemic is that it is crucial to provide researchers with reliable data under extremely
complex circumstances, in order to be able to assure public health decision makers
are provided with the most reliable information at any time. When this is by no ways
possible, the issue should be at least taken into account by using a model capable of
accommodating under-reported data like the one used in this study.

Appendix A. Technical details
Let yt,s and zt,s be the actual and registered counts of Covid-19 in each Spanish CCAA
s and day t respectively. In order to evaluate the impact of air temperature and nonpharmaceutical interventions undertaken by the Spanish government on spread of
SARS-CoV-2 several covariates were considered. In particular, xs1 represents the average temperature, xs2 represents the maximum temperature, xs3 represents the minimum
temperature and xs4 represents the non-pharmaceutical interventions. Additionally, the
covariates us and vs representing the number of PCR and antibodies tests undertaken
respectively were considered in the characterization of the under-reporting mechanism. The variable of interest to be modelled is an indicator random variable that
index the data into fully observed or under-reported. This indicator variable is to be
interpreted as the proportion of true counts that have been reported, and hence is continuous in [0,1]. The model is then specified according to the following equations:
zt,s | yt,s , γt,s ∼ Binomial(πs , yt,s )

log(λt,s ) = log(Pt,s ) + a0 + f1 (xs1 ) + f2 (xs2 ) + f3 (xs3 ) + f4 (xs4 ) + φs + θs ,

(4)

where φs and θs are additive effects from a spatially unstructured random effect and a
spatially structured one, respectively. Assuming that all individual occurrences have
equal chance of being independently reported, πs can be interpreted as the probability
that an actual occurrence is reported in a certain region s and is in fact the indicator

variable of interest. Functions g1 , g2 , f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 are orthogonal polynomials of degree 2. It is known that orthogonal polynomials reduce multiple-collinearity between
the monomial terms compared to raw polynomials.[12] The term log(Pt,s ), where Pt,s
is the population, is an offset to ensure the covariates act on the incidence rate. An
extra unstructured effect γt,s was included in the model for the reporting probability
