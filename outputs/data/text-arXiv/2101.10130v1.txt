ABSTRACT
Coronavirus, which emerged in China towards the end of 2019 and subsequently influenced the whole
world, has changed the daily lives of people to a great extent. In many parts of the world, in both cities
and rural areas, people have been forced to stay home weeks. They have only been allowed to leave
home for fundamental needs such as food and health needs, and most started to work from home. In
this period, very few people, including essential workers, had to leave their homes. Avoiding social
contact is proven to be the best method to reduce the spread of the novel Coronavirus. Because of the
COVID-19 pandemic, people are adapting their behavior to this new reality, and it may change the
type of public events people perform and how people go to these activities. Consumer behaviors have
been altered during the pandemic. While people try to avoid gatherings, they also stayed away from
mass transport modes and turned to private modes of transportation more -- private cars, private taxis
and bike-sharing systems; even walking became more popular. In this study, we attempt to analyze
how the use of bicycling has changed -- pre- and post-pandemic -- using open data sources and
investigating how socio-economics characteristics affect this change. The results showed that average
income, average education level, and total population are the most crucial variables for the Pandemic
to Transition period and the Transition to the Normalization period.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
In December 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak began in China and rapidly spread in numerous
countries all over the world. The pandemic, which has infected millions of people and resulted in the
death of thousands of people, was believed to originate from bats. Even though the origin has not yet
been proven, the outbreak has contaminated nearly every country in the world and, at the time of this
writing, is not been slowing down. It was swiftly declared a pandemic by the World Health
Organization (WHO (1) in March 2020, proving the severity of the issue.
Many countries have taken extraordinary measures to prevent the spread of the virus as much
as they reasonably could, shutting down public areas, restricting crowded events, and encouraging or
imposing work from home orders. All of these measures fall under the umbrella of "social distancing."
Social distancing is a dominant factor for preventing further spreading of the virus (such as COVID19, SARS, MERS, etc.), transmitted by respiratory droplets, and requires some certain physical space
between people (2). Some countries have taken stringent measures such as configuring lockdowns in
specific regions of the country. In contrast, other states have enforced less strict standards (3). This
also is true in the United States, where there is not a unified approach – where states are taking
different approaches to containing the virus. Taking everything into account, one fact is clear that the
effects of social distancing and coronavirus will last for a long time, and could become permanent.
Social distancing measures have affected consumer behavior, public gatherings, transportation
modes, and, in general, have altered how people live their daily lives. For instance, many countries
applied lockdowns, changing how people go to supermarkets, either limiting the capacity of an
enclosed area or implementing various curfews to different age groups. Scheduled events involving
many people were postponed; some production and factory processes were shut down. The gears of
the economy, imports, and exports suddenly started to decrease swiftly, forming a feeling of anxiety
for governments. Many people suddenly became unemployed, furloughed, or were forced to work
from home, and most public activities were postponed.
As a result, travel demand suffered a dramatic drop, and many countries reported that their car
traffic and the use of public transportation had drastically reduced (4; 5). The primary transportation
mode between cities and countries – air flights – have been dramatically cut back as well, impacting
the world’s economy significantly. When social distancing measures are lifted, it is expected that outof-home activities will regain their popularity and the use of public transportation will increase again.
However, as social distancing measures are lifted, some people will continue to be afraid of
the infectiousness and fatality of the virus. At this point, people might prefer alternative travel modes
that comply with social distancing guidelines (6). Certain features of transportation methodology will
undergo augmentation, altering what we approach as norms to differ. The majority will prefer to ride a
personal car, motorcycle, or bike in such cases. Because bikes are the most affordable option while
providing the highest safety regarding social distancing measures due to less interaction with people,
bike usage will be preferred by many people as an alternative to public transportation. This protects
them from possible contamination and reassures an opinion of safety amongst people. Walking to
nearby places is also a valid option; despite that, this might not apply safely to specific regions. For
instance, walking in a more closed-in area in a crowded city or neighborhood still carries a great deal
of risk of contamination, however in a more deserted community, walking should be the most efficient
and safe way of travel.
In a research study performed by the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy
(ITDP, 2020) in March in Guangzhou, China, 34% of people who used public transit systems
continued to use public transportation, while 40% of people did not. They preferred to use private cars,
taxis, walking and cycling because they were worried about the risk of getting infected. Another
research study revealed that usage of bicycle-sharing systems in Beijing (China) increased by 150%
from February 10th to March 4th, 2020 (7). Furthermore, short-distance riding increased as well as
long-distance travel increased. According to some bike-sharing companies' data, the share of long3

Kurkcu, Gokasar, Kalan, Timurogullari, Altin
distance cycling usage (more than 3 km) increased nearly twice in comparison to ridership during the
same period of last year (8). In England, some bike stores report facing increased demand. Manager of
Broadribb Cycles says that sales increased from around 20 – 30 bikes a day to 50 bikes a day (9).
Furthermore, cycling usage rate has seen a 200% increase, while car use roughly decreases by 40% in
Manchester, England (10).
Recent studies conducted in various countries also investigated the change in bicycle usage
during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, a study about New York City's Citibike usage during
the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that the bike-sharing system is much more resilient than urban
transportation systems to disruptive events. The results indicated a 70% bike ridership drop versus
90% transit ridership drop, respectively. It also found that the average duration of Citibike travels
significantly increased during the pandemic (11). Another study, a survey performed to inquire about
behavioral changes in terms of bike usage in Sydney, Australia, revealed an increase in the willingness
of bike usage for both hygiene and enjoyment reasons (12). In a Budapest, Hungary, case, modal share
change during the COVID-19 pandemic period investigated. That study found that there are positive
trends in the growing popularity of cycling as the share of public transport decreases (13). These
recently published studies in the literature illustrate the importance of cycling and quantify the resilient
nature of cycling as well as its preference over traditional public transit modes. Such a dramatic
increase in cycling captured the attention of some state governments. For instance, Greater Manchester
(England) announced that emergency funds will be allocated to promote walking and cycling to build
a more resilient and stronger region, where the data shows that cycling increased 42% in Greater
Manchester compared to the pre-lockdown period (14; 15).
Some researchers evaluated the increase in bicycle usage through a healthy community lens in
the literature. Nyenhuis et al. (16) provide some insights about exercising during the pandemic. They
quote an online forum user's indication about the Appalachian Trail as: "I have seen so many more
people on bikes around town compared to last Spring. I am not just talking about road cyclists, but
also people on cruiser bikes, mountain bikes, etc. It is actually good to see so many people out riding
with their kids, spouses, etc." (16). Park, Kim and Lee (17) is another study, which emphasizes the
health impacts of bicycle use during the COVID-19. Besides the physical health concerns, also the
psychological health impacts of bike use during the COVID-19 is also inquired. Additionally, a
difference in differences (DID) analysis is performed in Seoul, South Korea, for pre- and post-strict
social distancing periods. The results show that average bike-sharing system usage among commuters
and weekend users increased during social distancing period of 2020 (17). In an Oslo, Norway case, it
is found that the recreational activities increased and cyclists appeared on trailways and in green areas
much more than before the COVID-19 pandemic period (18).
As current trends and studies indicate, an increase in bicycle usage due to the COVID-19
pandemic might create an opportunity to increase sustainable transportation. Yet, an in-depth
investigation is necessary to be able to understand the extent of this new normal so that the process can
be controlled in favor of society. This study aims to reveal the relationship between bicycle usage and
socioeconomic factors by comparing data collected before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. It uses
continuously collected bicycle count data from fixed locations in the greater Denver metropolitan area
before and after the pandemic to quantify the change in non-motorized traffic volumes. Therefore,
bicycle catchment distances are taken as the radius by centering four bike count stations (19), and the
socioeconomic data within these catchment areas are collected (20). Afterward, obtained
socioeconomic data are analyzed with the change in bicycle usage percentages by using a machine
learning tool, Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), and initial results, and explanations are
obtained in correlation with the COVID-19 pandemic.
BICYCLE COUNT DATA
To better account for bicycle and pedestrian activity, the Colorado Department of
Transportation (CDOT) implemented a statewide bicycle and pedestrian plan to expand counting
locations to provide a comprehensive understanding of bicycle and pedestrian activity throughout the
state in 2012. This plan identified appropriate uses and needs for non-motorized data, developed
program goals, and created implementation plans. This study utilizes one of the outputs of the
statewide plan -- continuous bicycle count data – openly available through CDOT's website. Figure 1

below illustrates the automated data collection methodology. This developed data pipeline is also
publicly available, and the documentation of the code can be accessed at (21).

Figure 1. Bicycle Count Data Collection Pipeline
The data below in Table 1 is the ratio of change in bicycle counts, which was obtained using
the data pipeline explained in Figure 1 for four bicycle stations in various Colorado counties, located
in the USA. It consists of information for the percentage change in bicycle usage by dividing the
periods as Pre-Pandemic, Pandemic, Transition, and Normalization. The location of each station is
used as the center, and circles are drawn around stations to define the areas affected by the stations.
The radius of the circles is determined by the APTA standards and known as a catchment distance
(19). Figure 2 shows bicycle count stations and their catchment areas with various selected buffer
sizes. The socio-demographic data, which consists of income, education, age, population, and gender
information, was collected for each catchment area corresponding to a station.

Figure 2. Selected Bicycle Stations and Catchment Areas
After circumscribing the catchment area of each station, the counties within these regions are
identified, and the required data for these counties are collected from the database of Census Bureau of
U.S. Raw data containing economics, educational, and demographics data of counties' households.
These data are categorized, and average income level, average educational level, and average age are
obtained.

Economics data is divided into ten different categories and the number of people multiplied by
these income categories and divided by the total number of households to achieve an average
income level for each county.
Educational data is divided into nine different groups, and these categories are numbered 0 to
8, respectively, and the number of households multiplied by these numbers and distributed by
the total number of households to get average education level.
The same procedure is followed for demographics data to obtain average age for each county.
Furthermore, total population and male-to-female ratio are taken from raw data. After that,
using these data, average income level, educational level, age, total population, and male to
female ratio are obtained for each station.

METHODOLOGY
In this study, using the change in the two-year bicycle trip rate for the previous period, the
two-year change rate of bicycle trips of the following month will be estimated. The flow chart
showing the data collection, preprocessing, and the prediction model is given in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Data Analysis Flowchart
The available data includes the age, income level, education level, gender, and population
information of the users in a station's coverage area, and the change rate of the number of bicycle trips
in two years per period. The rate of change was obtained by dividing the number of bicycle trips at
each station in 2020 by that in 2018. The calculation of the periodic change rate, which is the
dependent variable of this study, is shown in Equation 1.

where:

𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡,𝑡𝑡−1=

𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡
𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡−1

(1)

1. 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡,𝑡𝑡−1 is the change rate of bicycle usage at a station from period t-1 to period t.
2. 𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡 is the number of bicycle usage at the station in period t
3. 𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡−1 is the number of bicycle usage at the station in period t-1

The data on bicycle trip rates and demographic characteristics of four different stations includes
each transition phase between periods. Since there is a small number of data, it is determined to apply
the Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) method. PLSR is a suitable method for a small amount of
data analysis, to observe the change in periodic change rate according to demographic characteristics.
To process the data appropriately in the PLSR method, the original data (𝑘𝑘) must be transformed
into standardized data (𝑥𝑥). Standardization for each variable is performed as follows:

where:

𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 =

� 𝑗𝑗
𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 −𝑘𝑘
𝜎𝜎𝑘𝑘,𝑗𝑗

1. 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 is the standardized one-dimensional data point at row i and column j of 𝑥𝑥,
7

(2)

Kurkcu, Gokasar, Kalan, Timurogullari, Altin
2. 𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 is the one-dimensional data in the k at row i and column j,

3. 𝑘𝑘�𝑗𝑗 is the mean value of the column j of the original data
4. 𝜎𝜎𝑘𝑘,𝑗𝑗 is the standard deviation of column j of 𝑘𝑘

After the dependent variable calculation and data standardization is completed, the data is
ready to be used in PLSR analysis. PLSR is a machine-learning technique that integrates assumptions
and attributes of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and multiple linear regression. In the PLSR
method, X (the data set of independent variables) and Y (the data set of dependent variables) sets are
written as a matrix product of factors, which are perpendicular to each other and variable-specific
loads in a different space. The Nonlinear Iterative Partial Least Squares (NIPALS) algorithm is
selected to apply decomposition to the data. The decomposition procedure is shown below
𝑋𝑋 = 𝑇𝑇 ⋅ 𝑃𝑃 𝑇𝑇 + 𝐸𝐸

where:

𝑌𝑌 = 𝑈𝑈 ⋅ 𝑄𝑄𝑇𝑇 + 𝐹𝐹

(4)

𝑇𝑇 = 𝑋𝑋 ⋅ 𝑊𝑊𝑥𝑥

(5)

𝑈𝑈 = 𝑌𝑌 ⋅ 𝑊𝑊𝑦𝑦

where:

𝑋𝑋 and Y are the set of independent variables and dependent variables, respectively,
T and U are the component matrix of X and Y, respectively. The shape of component
matrix changes according to the selected number of components.
P and Q are the loading matrix of X and Y, respectively,
E and F are the residual errors of X and Y, respectively,
𝑊𝑊𝑥𝑥 and 𝑊𝑊𝑦𝑦 are the weight matrices of X and Y, respectively.

Following decomposition of X and Y is completed, iteration is performed until T and U
matrices are obtained, which will maximize the covariance’s of X and Y. The first step of the iteration
is equalizing the errors to X and Y such that E = X and F = Y. The algorithm of minimizing error
terms for one variable is given below:
t = ej
u = fj
while True:
p = (XTu) / ||XTu||
t = Xp
q = (YTt) / ||YTt||
u = Yq
if t does not change:
break
E = E – tpT
F = F - uqT
where:
•
•
•

ej and fj are some column of E and F, respectively
t and u are the principal components of T and U, respectively
p and q are the principal components of P and Q, respectively.

The same steps are repeated for each variable of X and Y. In this study, the shape of X is 4x5, and the
shape of Y is 4x1. After the iterations are finished, factor matrices (T and U) and weight matrices (P and
Q) are created established to maximize the covariance between T and U.

RESULTS
Before interpreting the outputs resulting from the PLS regression analysis, the relationship
between each variable and the dependent variable was visually examined. Figure 4 shows the
relationship between average income and change in the number of bicycle trips for each period. The
average income shows a negative correlation with the periodic change rate for pandemic and
normalization periods, where the relationship is in contrast in the transition period. This means that as
the income level of people increases, the bicycle usage rate decreases. As shown before, the reason for
this can be that the possibility of having a private car is higher for people with higher incomes (22).
Besides, as the income level increase, the preferences might change in favor of private on-demand
services like taxis.

Figure 5 demonstrates that the average education level has a negative correlation with the
bicycle usage rate in the normalization period. According to a study, as average education level rises,
the welfare level of people also increases (23). So that the likelihood of having private cars increases,
and this removes the necessity to use other transportation systems such as public transportation, bikes,
or walking. Even though the education level has a negative correlation during Normalization, the
situation is the opposite for the transition period that is the bicycle usage rate in the transition period
increases in parallel with the education level. Meaning that educated people are more sensitive about
the pandemic, and they avoid crowded places where the risk of the rate of contamination is higher

Figure 6 shows that there is a general decrease in bicycle usage as the age increases except for
the normalization period. The decrease is especially significant during the pandemic period. It might
have different reasoning, such as the decrease in physical ability, less sensitivity, and conciseness for
the situation or not using any means of transportation due to infection risk.

According to Figure 7, the total population has a positive correlation with the bicycle usage
rate in the normalization period, meaning that as the overall population increases, bicycle usage rate
increases. So, people stay away from crowded transportation options where the risk is higher for
higher population areas to avoid getting infected. Thus, the tendency to use a bicycle as transportation
options increases.

Proportion of Variance
Table 2 summarizes the proportion of variance explained matrices of the PLSR for PrePandemic-to-Pandemic, Pandemic-to-Transition, and Transition-to- Normalization period,
respectively. For all three periods, the 3rd latent factor has the least X variance value. This latent
factor can also make the prediction model to overfit. A well-fitting model would have similar and high
X and Y variance values. Additionally, as the Y variance value increases, for a new sample of
dependent values, the latent factor becomes more powerful in terms of explaining the variation. The
more a latent factor can explain the variance of independent variables, the observed values of the set of
11

Kurkcu, Gokasar, Kalan, Timurogullari, Altin
independent variables are reflected even better. Latent factor 1, for all three periods, have the highest
X variance and Y variance and, therefore, is more powerful for the developed model. According to the
adjusted R-square values, the Transition-to-Normalization period is the best-fitted period for this
model, and the Pre-Pandemic-to-Pandemic period is the worst-fitted period for this model.

Weights and Loadings:
5x3 W_x and 1x3 W_y weight matrices for all period transitions are given in Table 3. These
matrices are positively correlated with the T and U matrices in line with the (3) and (4). The X-weights
in Table 3 demonstrate the correlation of X variables with the Y scores. 5x3 P and 1x3 Q loading
matrices are also shown in Table 3. The X-loadings in Table 4 also represents the direction of the
principal components for each independent variable in X-space. According to the preliminary
assessment of the loadings and weights tables, the results we expect from the interpretation of variance
coefficients table are:

Average age and gender are the dominating demographical parameter for the PrePandemic-to-Pandemic period. An increase in age and the male rate in population will
cause a decrease in the change of bicycle trips.
In contrast to the Pre-Pandemic-to-Pandemic period, in the Pandemic-to-Transition
period, the male/female rate shows a strong positive correlation with the change of bicycle
trips on stations. From the loading matrix, it is also expected that there is a positive
correlation with average age and the dependent variable.
At this period, it is expected that there is a strong negative correlation between average
income, education level, and age and the periodic change rate. In contrast, the total
population and male/female rate shows a positive correlation.

Parameters and Variable Importance
Table 5 shows the importance of the independent variables for projection for its latent factor
and period, and in Table 6, the regression parameters' estimated coefficients are presented for all
periods. According to Table 5, in the pre-pandemic to pandemic period, the average age variable is
the most critical variable for all latent factors. It has a much higher impact on the rate of bicycle use.
From Table 6, it can be observed that the average age parameter has a negative effect on the
dependent variable. Average income, average education level, and total population are the most crucial
variables for the Pandemic-to-Transition period and the Transition-to-Normalization period. Average
income and average education level parameters have a positive influence on the dependent variable,
whereas the total population variable has a negative impact.

CONCLUSIONS
Various studies in the literature suggest many people are turning to cycling as a resilient, safe,
and reliable mode of transportation to fill the gap of safe transport modes. Many urban cycling
networks have seen a dramatic increase in non-motorized traffic, including China, Hungary, Korea,
and the United States.
Some governments are responding to this emerging demand by opening emergency bicycle
lanes, converting roads, and opening them for the use of non-motorized traffic, and creating one-way
bike lanes in order to comply with social distancing guidelines.
This study attempts to quantify such trends of increasing demand and investigate the
relationship between bicycle usage and socioeconomic factors of surrounding areas. Three different
study periods were created to understand the shift from pre-pandemic to post-pandemic levels. A
machine learning tool, PLSR, was deployed to explain the underlying contributing factors to bikedemand. Initial results showed that average income, average education level, and total population are
the most crucial variables for the Pandemic-to- Transition period and the Transition-to-Normalization
period. Average income and average education level parameters have a positive influence on the
dependent variable, whereas the total population variable has a negative impact.
This analysis has also shown the location-based impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on bicycle
demand. While some stations experience an increased demand during the selected periods, others saw
a decrease in bicycle usage.
The results of this study may be considered as evidence on the role of non-motorized travel
modes -- cycling specifically. Even though results indicate that post-pandemic bicycle demand is
slightly decreasing, an increasing number of cases may have an impact on future bicycle usage. Future
work will focus on collecting additional data to cover the whole period of the spread of coronavirus in
not only Colorado but also additional locations throughout the country. It will investigate the locationbased impact on commuting needs and the long-term impacts of the virus as opposed to the limited
duration used in this study.
