Abstract
The spread of new coronavirus (COVID-19) infections continues to increase. The practice of social
distance attracts attention as a measure to prevent the spread of infection, but it is difficult for some
occupations. Therefore, in previous studies, the scale of factors that determine social distance has been
developed. However, it was not clear how to select the items among them, and it seemed to be
somewhat arbitrary. In response to this trend, this paper extracted eight scales by performing
exploratory factor analysis based on certain rules while eliminating arbitrariness as much as possible.
They were Adverse Conditions, Leadership, Information Processing, Response to Aggression,
Mechanical Movement, Autonomy, Communication with the Outside, and Horizontal Teamwork. Of
these, Adverse Conditions, Response to Aggression, and Horizontal Teamwork had a positive
correlation with Physical Proximity, and Information Processing, Mechanical Movement, Autonomy,
and Communication with the Outside had a negative correlation with Physical Proximity. Furthermore,
as a result of multiple regression analysis, it was shown that Response to Aggression, not the mere
teamwork assumed in previous studies, had the greatest influence on Physical Proximity.

Introduction
The spread of new coronavirus (COVID-19) infections is increasing steadily. As of this writing,
August 8, 2020, there are 19,382,107 infected people worldwide (Johns Hopkins University &
Medicine, 2020). The recommended practice of preventing infection is the social distance, that is,
maintaining the distance between people (World Health Organization, 2020). However, some jobs are
easy and difficult to take social distance. Therefore, research to clarify the relationship between work
characteristics and social distance is becoming active (Crowley & Doran, 2020; Dingel & Neiman,
2020; Hatayama et al., 2020; Koren & Pető, 2020). Such research can give great hints and significance
to the new industrial structure in the era of with-corona. However, it does not mean that there is no
problem at all, such as making people feel arbitrary about how to make the scale.
Therefore, this paper uses 98 items recorded in the Work Context and Work Activities of
O*NET to perform factor analysis while eliminating arbitrariness as much as possible. Then, after
creating an independent variable from the extracted factors, a regression analysis using Physical

1

Proximity as the dependent variable is performed. The purpose of this is to find the factors that
influence the social distance (Physical Proximity as a proxy variable). At the same time, Koren & Pető
(2020)’s Teamwork, Customer and Presence, and Dingel & Neiman (2020)’s Remote Working Index
will be used as independent variables to verify whether these are useful as determinants of social
distance.

Review of previous studies
Research to clarify the relationship between work characteristics and social distance is becoming more
active (Crowley & Doran, 2020; Dingel & Neiman, 2020; Hatayama et al., 2020; Koren & Pető, 2020).
Among them, the Social Distance Index developed by Koren & Pető (2020) and the Remote Working
Index developed by Dingel & Neiman (2020) have 49 and 266 citations respectively (as of August 8,
2020, computed by Google Scholar). However, there is some arbitrariness in how to create the
indicators. The former classifies 14 questionnaire items recorded in O*NET, an occupational
information site in the United States, into these 3 categories, based on the hypothesis that three factors
that influence social distance are Teamwork, Customer, and Presence. The latter also creates variables
on the assumption that 17 items related to outdoor work etc. recorded in O*NET influence the
executability of remote work. However, neither of them clearly shows the criteria for classification.
Probably they are classified by the authors’ eyes.
However, there is no guarantee that the respondents to the questionnaire have responded as
the researchers intended. For example, the variables created as Teamwork by Koren & Pető (2020)
include items related to leadership. Perhaps there is a difference in the possibility of social distance
between vertical and horizontal teams. In the first place, it is a problem that the correlation between
Work Context - Physical Proximity, the items seemingly closest to the feasibility of social distance
and remote work among the items recorded in O*NET, and each scale is not verified.
Therefore, in this paper, to eliminate arbitrariness as much as possible, some factors common
to various occupations will be extracted by performing exploratory factor analysis based on certain
rules. And based on those factors, we will show the factors that determine Physical Proximity by
performing multiple regression analysis using the constructed independent variables. At the same time,
we will analyze Teamwork, Customer, Presence by Koren & Pető (2020), and the Remote Working
Index by Dingel & Neiman (2020) as independent variables, and verify whether these are useful as
determinants of social distance.

Importance and Level are recorded in Work Activities, but Importance is used in the current research
following previous research. All items are in the format of making a number from 0 to 100 for
frequency and importance. The criterion for factor extraction is eigenvalue 1 or more, and the factor
load is calculated after performing varimax rotation by the main factor method. After that, items with
a factor load of less than 0.4 and items with a factor load of 0.4 or more on a plurality of factors are
excluded, and factor analysis is performed again using the same criteria. After that, this process is
repeated until there are no items whose factor loads are less than 0.4 and items whose factor loads are
0.4 or more. Here, we follow the idea of Stevens (1992) who suggests using a cut-off of 0.4,
irrespective of sample size, for interpretative purposes. After the factor structure is established, this
paper presents a simple hypothesis that should be verified and performs a regression analysis using
the variables consisting of each factor as the independent variable and Physical Proximity as the
dependent variable to analyze the factors that influence social distance.
As a result of repeating the factor analysis 6 times by the above method, as shown in Table
1, eight factors consisting of 46 items were extracted. Note that the sentences listed are not the question
text, but the content of the question text. Details of questions and options can be referred to on O*NET,
so they are omitted in this article. However, to give an example, the question sentence corresponding
to the content sentence at the top of the table, “Work Context - Very Hot or Cold Temperatures” is
“How often does this job require working in very hot (above 90 F degrees) or very cold (below 32 F
degrees) temperatures?”, and the options are “Never”, “Once a year or more but not every month”,
“Once a month or more but not every week”, “Once a week or more but not every day”, and “Every
day”. For each answer, 0 points, 25 points, 50 points, 75 points, and 100 points are assigned, and the
average value is calculated for each occupation. Also, the Physical Proximity used as a dependent
variable in the current research is selected from “I don’t work near other people (beyond 100ft.)”, “I
work with others but not closely (e.g., private office)”, “Slightly close (e.g., shared office)”,
“Moderately close (at arm’s length)”, and “Very close (near touching)” for the question sentence of
“To what extent does this job require the worker to perform job tasks in close physical proximity to
other people?” and is similarly assigned a value of 0 to 100 when totaling.
Based on the contents of the included items, the factors were named as Adverse Conditions,
Leadership, Information Processing, Response to Aggression, Mechanical Movement, Autonomy,
Communication with the Outside, and Horizontal Teamwork. By the way, Physical Proximity is not
included in any of these variables because it loaded multiple factors in the first factor analysis. As
indicated by the symbol (R) at the end of the sentence, four of Adverse Conditions overlap with
Remote Working in Dingel & Neiman (2020). Also, as shown in (P), one of them overlaps with the
Presence of Koren & Pető (2020). Similarly, three of the Leadership and one of Horizontal Teamwork
overlap with Teamwork of Koren & Pető (2020) as shown in (T). One of Response to Aggression
overlaps with the Presence of Koren & Pető (2020) as shown in (P). There were no duplicate items

3

with Customer of Koren & Pető (2020). Overall, 9 of 46 items, or 19.6%, overlapped with either or
both of Dingel & Neiman (2020) and Koren & Pető (2020).

Hypothesis
Of the eight factors, Leadership, Response to Aggression, and Horizontal Teamwork are factors that
include relationships with people and are expected to require Physical Proximity. From this, the
following hypotheses are derived.
H1: Leadership, Response to Aggression, Horizontal Teamwork have a positive correlation with
Physical Proximity.
On the other hand, Information Processing, Autonomy, Mechanical Movement, and
Communication with the Outside are considered to be jobs that do not require physical contact with
people. From this, the following hypotheses are derived.
H2: Information Processing, Autonomy, Mechanical Movement, Communication with the Outside
have a negative correlation with Physical Proximity.
Besides, Adverse Conditions does not generally require closeness to people, but it is

5

expected that some people will be required to have closeness if the job requires more than one person
in case of an unexpected situation. Therefore, the following hypothesis is derived.
H3: Adverse Conditions has a positive correlation with Physical Proximity.
What has the strongest correlation with Physical Proximity? Information Processing,
Autonomy, Mechanical Movement, and Communication with the Outside are elements that do not
require Physical Proximity, and at the same time, they are not elements that actively distance Physical
Proximity. Therefore, it is expected that any of the Leadership, Response to Aggression, and
Horizontal Teamwork, which express relationships with people, is most strongly correlated with
Physical Proximity. Of these, leadership can be demonstrated over long distances depending on the
content, so it is considered that the correlation with Physical Proximity is weakest. Virtually
reconstructing the reporting line shouldn't be too difficult if the relationship between the top and
bottom is clear. There is also a study showing that virtual is more effective than face to face for some
leadership (Purvanova & Bono, 2009). In this regard, Horizontal Teamwork is an element that involves
a more horizontal relationship, so it is considered that Physical Proximity is required compared to
Leadership. This is because who takes the initiative depends on the tasks that change day by day. Also,
when someone performs many tasks, adjustments are frequently made such that someone reduces the
tasks. However, with the proper feedback and procedural justification from the boss, the adverse
effects of role ambiguity can be significantly reduced (De Clercq & Belausteguigoitia, 2017; Jong,
2016). Therefore, it is expected that Response to Aggression has the greatest correlation with Physical
Proximity. This is because collaboration with a person who is not good at emotional control is likely
to induce an unexpected situation, so it is considered necessary to have him or her nearby and to
cooperate with others around them. Previous studies have shown that maintaining physical proximity
to students, for example, is most necessary for teachers to turn their negative consciousness into a
positive one (den Brock et al., 2005). Therefore, the following hypothesis is derived.
H4: Response to Aggression has the strongest positive correlation with Physical Proximity.

Analysis and result
Table 2 is descriptive statistics. In addition to the above eight variables, Physical Proximity, the three
variables of Teamwork, Customer, and Presence by Koren & Pető (2020) and Remote Working by
Dingel & Neiman (2020) are listed with their values and correlations by the author's calculation. In
general, 0.7 or more is considered to be an acceptable reliability coefficient (Cortina, 1993), but several
researchers have accepted it as 0.6 or more (Taber, 2018; van Griethuijsen et al., 2015). According to
the latter criterion, all eight variables are acceptable. However, according to the former criteria,
Mechanical Movement and Horizontal Teamwork are unacceptable. Therefore, for Mechanical
Movement, we prepared a 3-item version without Work Context-Time Pressure, and for Horizontal

6

Teamwork, we prepared a 3-item version with Work Context-Coordinate or Lead Others, dropped in
the first factor analysis because it was the same factor as the other two items but loaded on other
factors, added. After confirming that the reliability coefficients of these variables were 0.7 or more,
they were used for the following analysis alternatively (The result is omitted because it did not make
a big difference).
Looking at the magnitude of the correlation coefficient, all except for the two categories of
Leadership and Mechanical Movement show a statistically significant correlation with Physical
Proximity at the 5% level. However, the values exceeding 0.1, which is the standard value for "small"
by Cohen (1988), are observed in three variables of Response to Aggression (r=0.456, p<0.01),
Autonomy (r=-0.130, p<0.05), Horizontal Teamwork (r=0.306, p <0.01). Of these, only two, Response
to Aggression and Horizontal Teamwork, exceeded the standard value of 0.3 for the “medium” by
Cohen (1988). By the way, as shown in the table, among the three variables of Koren & Pető (2020),
it is Customer (r=0.415, p<0.01) and Presence (r=0.197, p<0.01) that exceed 0.1, and only Customer
of these exceeded 0.3. Dingel & Neiman (2020)’s Remote Working (r=-0.356, p<0.01) also exceeded
0.3. However, the coefficient of Koren & Pető (2020)’s Teamwork (r=0.098, p<0.01) was below 0.1.
This is probably because, as described at the beginning, items that represent horizontal teamwork and
items that represent vertical teamwork are mixed in the variable.
Table 3 shows the results of regression analysis. Eight independent variables are individually
inputted into the regression equation. Response to Aggression (β=0.456, p<0.01) and Horizontal
Teamwork (β=0.306, p<0.01) showed a significant positive correlation, supporting H1. Information
Processing (β=-0.085, p<0.01), Autonomy (β=-0.129, p<0.01), Communication with the Outside (β=0.065, p<0.05) showed a significant negative correlation. This is the result of supporting H2.
Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was shown in Adverse Conditions (β=0.074, p<0.05),
supporting H3. However, regarding Leadership (β = 0.057, p>0.05) where a positive correlation was
expected and Mechanical Movement (β = 0.001, p>0.05) where a negative correlation was expected,
a significant correlation was not found at the 5% level. Comparing the adjusted R-squared, Response
to Aggression was the largest at 0.207, followed by Horizontal Teamwork at 0.093 and Autonomy at
0.016. This shows that Response to Aggression has the greatest influence on social distance, and it can
be said that this is the result of supporting H4.

The first column of Table 4 is the result of multiple regression analysis by the stepwise
method. Response to Aggression (β=0.460, p<0.01), Horizontal Teamwork (β=0.288, p<0.01) showed
a positive correlation and Information Processing (β=-0.096, p<0.01), Mechanical Movement (β=0.099, p< 0.01) and Communication with the Outside (β=-0.254, p<0.01) showed a negative
correlation. Among them, Mechanical Movement did not show a significant correlation by simple
correlation but showed a significant negative correlation by multiple regression controlling the effects
of other variables consistently with the hypothesis. On the other hand, Adverse Conditions and
Autonomy showed positive and negative correlations in single regression, respectively, but did not
show a significant correlation in multiple regression controlling the effects of other variables.
Leadership showed no significant correlation in either single regression or multiple regression.

Looking at the results of the three items of Koren & Pető (2020) from the second column of
the table, Customer (β=0.595, p<0.01) and Presence (β=0.333, p<0.01) showed a positive correlation,
being the same as the single correlation, but Teamwork (β = -0.179, p<0.01) showed a negative
correlation. It is theoretically difficult to think that Teamwork has a negative correlation with Physical
Proximity, so it can be interpreted as a problem of multicollinearity. This indicates that some caution
is required when using the three items of Koren & Pető (2020). By the way, 14 variables that compose
the three variables of Koren & Pető (2020) were simply averaged and subtracted from 100 to create
one variable Social Distance Index (α=0.727, mean value = 50.753, standard deviation = 9.085)
following the way of Crowley & Doran (2020), and examined the relationship with Physical Proximity.
Although the problem of multicollinearity was solved, the adjusted R-squared dropped significantly
(β=0.437, p<0.01, R2=0.190).
Therefore, in the third column, the results of a regression analysis performed on a variable
group in which Customer and Remote Working whose adjusted R-squared for single regression exceed
0.13, the “medium” level (Cohen, 1988), are added to the first column model are shown experimentally.
In addition to Customer and Remote Working, four of the five variables shown in the first column,
except for the Mechanical Movement, are significant. However, the magnitude of the partial
correlation coefficient is different between the first and third columns, and it seems that there is a
problem of multicollinearity. This is understandable considering that many of the items that make up
Customer and Remote Working were the ones excluded during the exploratory factor analysis due to
the load on multiple factors. Despite this problem, the fact that the variables in the first column
including Response to Aggression became significant even after controlling the impact of Customer
and Remote Working indicates the robustness of the model in the first column. For reference, the
adjusted R-squared for all the three models in Table 4, 0.319, 0.293, and 0.491, exceed 0.26, the “large”
level (Cohen, 1988). Among them, the value of the mixed model in the third column is the highest.
Therefore, although it is worrisome that the distortion of the partial correlation coefficient impairs the
accuracy of the influence of individual variables, the mixed model in the third column is considered
to be useful for predicting the feasibility of social distances more accurately by taking into account
differences in customer contact and outdoor activities.

Discussion
The purpose of this paper is to find variables that correlate with Physical Proximity based on an
exploratory method. The scales extracted as a result of the factor analysis were Adverse Conditions,
Leadership, Information Processing, Response to Aggression, Mechanical Movement, Autonomy,
Communication with the Outside, and Horizontal Teamwork. Of these, Adverse Conditions, Response
to Aggression, and Horizontal Teamwork were shown to have a positive correlation with Physical
Proximity, and Information Processing, Autonomy, and Communication with the Outside were shown
to have a negative correlation with Physical Proximity. Besides, as a result of multiple regression
analysis, the model in which five variables of Information Processing, Response to Aggression,
Mechanical Movement, Autonomy, Communication with the Outside, and Horizontal Teamwork were
simultaneously introduced showed the adjusted R-squared of more than 0.3. Above all, Response to
Aggression was shown to be the most important factor affecting Physical Proximity.
In parallel, we verified the relationship between the three variables shown by Koren & Pető
(2020) and Physical Proximity and found that the correlation of Customer is significantly larger than
that of Teamwork and Presence. It was also shown that the problem of multicollinearity occurred and
the Teamwork coefficient was reversed when the three variables are applied to the regression equation
at the same time, and it became clear that some caution is required in use. On the other hand, the
variables that combine the three variables of Koren & Pető (2020) into one, or the Remote Working
Index of Dingel & Neiman (2020) showed a significant correlation with Physical Proximity, avoiding
the problem of multicollinearity. However, their adjusted R-squared were below 0.2, which leaves
dissatisfaction with the model's explanatory power. In an attempt, we added the Customer of Koren &
Pető (2020), which represents the contact with the customer, and the Remote Working of Dingel &
Neiman (2020), which represents the small amount of outdoor activity, to our multiple regression
model consisting of five variables. As a result, although the partial regression coefficient was distorted
due to the problem of multicollinearity, it was significant in four of five variables including Response
to Aggression in addition to Customer and Remote Working. This result shows that the model

12

presented in this paper is significant even when the variables in the previous study are controlled. At
the same time, it suggests that this mixed model can be used with higher accuracy when predicting the
possibility of social distance in the workplace.
In the model shown in this paper, in addition to Response to Aggression, Horizontal
Teamwork shows a positive correlation, while Information Processing, Mechanical Movement, and
Communication with the Outside show negative correlation, with Physical Proximity. Those who need
Response to Aggression or Horizontal Teamwork and have few Information Processing, Mechanical
Movement, or Communication with the Outside will have the most difficulty in securing social
distance.

Implication
In the study by Koren & Pető (2020), a model was constructed assuming that one of the three factors
that influence social distance is Teamwork. However, the results of this paper show that Response to
Aggression has a greater influence on Physical Proximity than on Horizontal Teamwork. This means
that while some horizontal teamwork is possible even in the virtual world (Krumm et al., 2016; Painter
et al., 2016), it is difficult to respond remotely and on the spot when dealing with people who bring
confrontation such as getting angry or offensive. It means that it is necessary to face and deal with
them directly. Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that science and technology will replace aggressive
human contact. For instance, in the field of robot development, it has been pointed out that it is the
most difficult task to operate in an unstructured environment that assumes contact with humans (Mori,
2020).
In this paper, to eliminate arbitrariness as much as possible, we have shown a model for
determining physical proximity by executing exploratory factor analysis based on certain rules,
extracting eight factors, and performing multiple regression analysis. The types of jobs that are hard
to avoid Physical Proximity because of the response to aggression include teachers of
elementary/middle school and special education, therapists, technicians, nurses, employees of
restaurants and entertainment facilities, travel/postal service clerks, flight/transportation attendants,
etc. For such occupations, it may not be easy to secure a social distance by replacing them with remote
work, so it is necessary to devise and implement protective measures that can suppress infection even
when they are close to people. However, in reality, people whose emotions cannot be suppressed exist
in many workplaces not limited to these occupations in the process of contacting customers. For
example, the results of an interview survey show that nurses suffer most from aggression from
colleagues rather than from patients (Farrell, 1997). Therefore, the results of this paper suggest that
the existence of such people may make Physical Proximity, which would otherwise be avoided by
remote work, inevitable. Learning how to control own emotions well (Denson et al., 2011), and
building a mechanism of reciprocity by increasing the social capital to suppress selfish thinking

13

(Kokubun, 2020; Kokubun et al., 2020), etc. are also considered to be successful in the practice of
social distance. At the same time, it should be noted that member aggression often results from
mistreatment in the organization. For example, previous studies report that perceived injustice (Beugré,
2005) or unfair treatment of bosses (Neuman and Baron, 1998) increases employee aggression.
Therefore, management ingenuity such as devising a method of giving reasonable feedback
to the employees should also lead to increasing the possibility of social distance.

Limitation
This paper exploratively extracted the factors that are the variables used in regression analysis, using
the average values by the occupation of the attitude survey data recorded in the US occupation
information site, O*NET. Therefore, if the primary data before being aggregated by occupation can
be obtained and the results of this paper can be verified, its significance will be great. Besides, Physical
Proximity used as the dependent variable of the analysis is a variable based on the questionnaire survey
results and may differ from the actual proximity. It is also significant to verify the analytical model in
this paper after measuring the actual proximity using GPS location information, etc.

Conclusion
The spread of new coronavirus (COVID-19) infections continues to increase. The practice of social
distance attracts attention as a measure to prevent the spread of infection, but it is difficult for some
occupations. Therefore, in previous studies, the scale of factors that determine social distance has been
developed. However, it was not clear how to select the items among them, and it seemed to be
somewhat arbitrary. In response to this trend, this paper extracted eight scales by performing
exploratory factor analysis based on certain rules while eliminating arbitrariness as much as possible.
They were Adverse Conditions, Leadership, Information Processing, Response to Aggression,
Mechanical Movement, Autonomy, Communication with the Outside, and Horizontal Teamwork. Of
these, Adverse Conditions, Response to Aggression, and Horizontal Teamwork had a positive
correlation with Physical Proximity, and Information Processing, Mechanical Movement, Autonomy,
and Communication with the Outside had a negative correlation with Physical Proximity. Furthermore,
as a result of multiple regression analysis, it was shown that Response to Aggression, not the mere
teamwork assumed in previous studies, had the greatest influence on Physical Proximity.
