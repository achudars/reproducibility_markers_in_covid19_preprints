Introduction

This note describes a simple score to indicate the effectiveness of mitigation against infections
of COVID-19 as observed by new case counts. The score includes normalization, making
comparisons across jurisdictions possible. The smoothing employed provides robustness in the
face of reporting vagaries while retaining salient features of evolution, enabling a clearer
picture for decision makers and the public.

The idea

While the daily number of new cases always has relevance to resource allocation, its current
value alone does not say much about the effectiveness of strategies to decrease contagion. For
example, on 15 June 2020, Oregon reported 443 new cases, while the state of New York
reported 620. Are either of those numbers cause for alarm or relief? It turns out that the
largest number of new cases in a single day ever reported by Oregon was, in fact, 443, while the
largest number for New York was about 11 thousand, suggesting that Oregon is not doing well
at mitigating new infections, while New York appears to be doing a good job, despite the New
York number being larger. Clearly, the numbers must be viewed in the context of the past.
This observation suggests a simple measure of mitigation effectiveness: the ratio of the current
case rate to the highest observed case rate. The term “case rate” glosses over the fact that new
cases are reported erratically, being subject to batching, errors that are later corrected, and
other perturbations.
Below is an overview of the approach and a guide to the sections.

Smoothing

We are given a set of new case counts 𝑐! , 𝑐" , … , 𝑐# , where 𝑐$ is the number of new cases
reported for day 𝑑. Note that 𝑇 is the number of days for which we have observations, and
advances every day.
We wish to act on “smoothed” counts {𝑐̅% } that better reflect an underlying case rate and
accommodate both delays in reporting and error correction that often occurs within a few days
following the errors. That smoothing can be implemented by convolving the raw counts with a
window whose weights are {𝑤% }:
𝑐̅$ = +

$&!

1
∑$&!
%'$&# 𝑤%

. / 𝑤% 𝑐$&% ,
%'$&#

with the parenthesized term normalizing the applied weights to sum to 1. The slightly
complicated appearance of expression above is due to the need to accommodate the finite
range of times for which we have counts. In particular, the most current smoothed value, 𝑐̅# , is
given by
1

#&!

𝑐̅# = + #&! . / 𝑤% 𝑐#&%
∑%'( 𝑤%
%'(

In practice, the window has finite duration, and the summing is done over only a small number
of points.
It might be tempting to choose a rectangular window, but that will lead to unnecessary
jaggedness and does not reflect the likelihood that relevance of counts to a day in question
diminishes more smoothly with distance. A better choice is a window that has a softly rounded
center with skirts that fall off more quickly.
Since the details of erratic reporting are not known, it might be hard to claim a particular shape
as being “optimum.” The author chose a Hamming window, popular in signal processing:
0.54 + 0.46 cos (𝑖𝜋/𝑊),
𝑤% = 1
0,

|𝑖| ≤ 𝑊,
otherwise,

where 𝑊is the width. Note that while this computation uses 2𝑊 + 1 days of data, its
!
“effective” width is approximately 𝑊 days, since 𝑤% ≈ " when |𝑖| = ⌊𝑊/2⌋.

Figures 1 through 5 show the raw1 and smoothed daily new case counts for five jurisdictions
using a Hamming window of varying width. In particular, Figure 3 shows a correction close to
the middle of the period, where the number of new cases is negative, fixing an over-reported
count a few days prior. Figure 4 appears to show a positive correction, fixing a day in which no
new cases were reported. Figures 1, 2, 3, and 5 show 30 days; Figure 4 shows 90 days.
It would appear that a width of 7 is a good compromise between smoothing uninformative
irregularities and preserving salient behavior.

It is useful to compare the suggested Hamming smoothing to the often-employed rectangular
windowing, also referred to as a “moving average” or “rolling average” or “running average” or
“sliding average”. For a rectangular window of width 𝑊, the value reported on day 𝑑 is the
average value over 𝑊 consecutive days, either ending on day 𝑑 (so the window is to the left of
the day) or centered on day 𝑑. In the latter case, the most recent reports can make use only of
data up to the present, so they must average over fewer days (just as employed above for the
weighted averaging). The most often employed smoothing seems to have settled on a 7-day

moving average ending on the day of reporting,2 though early reporting often used 3-day
averages.
Figures 6 and 7 offer a comparison between windowing using the Hamming window (𝑊 = 7)
and simple running averages, employing rectangular windows. Figure 6 shows running
averages centered on the centered on the day being described, while Figure 7 shows a window
to the left of the day, that is, the window ends on the day of reporting. In the latter case, the
averaged values lag the raw values by a half of the window size.
The figures show that simple running averages using 𝑊 = 3 are subject to the wild fluctuations
common in the reported data. When the averaging window is increased to having the same
effective window size as the Hamming window (𝑊 = 7), it still exhibits distracting jaggedness.
Even when using 𝑊 = 15, the same number of data points as the Hamming window, the
running average suffers uninformative deviations. (This is more obvious in Figure 7, due to the
offset in time.)

The Simple Mitigation Score3

Having smoothed the counts, we are in a position to produce a mitigation score. The (simple)
mitigation score 𝐴$ for day 𝑑 is defined as
𝐴(𝑑) =

𝑐̅$
,
max {𝑐)̅ }

𝑑 ∈ {1, 2, … , 𝑇}.

)∈{!,",…,$}

A value near zero means that the current rate is small relative to the maximum rate; a value
equal to one means that the current rate is as large as it has ever been.
3

In earlier versions and implementations, this score was referred to as the “abatement” score, a label which also
appears in some of the figures here.

new cases mitigation score for 15 June 2020, with a value of zero represented by green, a value
of one represented by red, and intermediate values shown by intermediate colors. Also shown
are the raw new case counts and the mitigation score over the preceding 90 days for the state
of New York. Although New York was one of the hardest hit areas, the measures taken there
appear to have been quite successful in reducing the spread of infection.
Conversely, Figure 9 shows that while new cases had been reduced in Florida, progress
reversed dramatically, resulting in a new high of infection rate.

Adjusting for testing

An obvious concern about the formulation of a mitigation score so far is that it would favorably
judge a jurisdiction that had stopped reporting altogether. Less drastic would be a lowering of
the score simply due to a lessening of testing. Conversely, a jurisdiction that aggressively
increased testing would be penalized for the larger number of new cases discovered.
Accordingly, if testing numbers are known, they should be incorporated in the score.
Let 𝑝% be the number of tests conducted on day 𝑖. The reporting of tests {𝑝% } suffers from the
same temporal perturbations that the counts {𝑐% } do. We may deal with those irregularities by
smoothing the test counts in the same manner as the case counts, using the resulting {𝑝̅% },
where
𝑝̅$ = +

1
∑$&!
%'$&# 𝑤%

$&!

. / 𝑤% 𝑝$&% .
%'$&#

While there is no requirement that the same smoothing window be applied to the test counts
as the case counts, there seems no motivation to do otherwise, and it will be assumed for
examples below that the same Hamming window is applied to both.
To incorporate the testing counts into the mitigation score, we divide the (smoothed) case
counts by the (smoothed) testing counts. The testing-adjusted mitigation score for day 𝑑 is

𝐴(𝑑) =

𝑐̅$ /𝑝̅$

max {𝑐)̅ /𝑝̅) }

𝑑 ∈ {1, 2, … , 𝑇}.

)∈{!,",…,$}

Note that setting the testing rate to a constant causes the testing-adjusted mitigation score to
reduce to the simple mitigation score defined earlier. Stated another way, if we don’t have
testing statistics, we use the simple (unadjusted) mitigation score, which carries the implicit
assumption that the testing rate is uniform.
Testing-adjusted mitigation is best done with horizon limiting, described below.

6.

Limiting the horizon

The mitigation score compares the state in the neighborhood of a day in question to the worst
state seen in that jurisdiction up to that time. It may be too generous to consider all prior
times, since so much has changed in the understanding, reporting, testing, and response to the
disease. Moreover, we are probably more interested in a more recent behavior. The fact that
we are much better than half a year ago may be small comfort if we are much worse than a
month ago. Accordingly, it may be appropriate to define a horizon on interest before which we
ignore what happened. Let that horizon be specified as being 𝐻 days long. Then our horizonconstrained mitigation score for day 𝑑 is normalized by the maximum over the 𝐻 days ending in
day 𝑑:
𝐴/ (𝑑) =

𝑐̅$ /𝑝̅$
max

Examples of testing adjustment

The use of testing-adjusted4 mitigation with a sensible horizon is revealing, as Figure 10 shows,
which compares testing-adjusted 30-day horizon scores to unadjusted scores with no horizon
constraint. While many states, mostly in the middle of the country (ND, SD, NE, KS), look less
favorable when testing is considered, some states (MN, SC, GA) benefit from testing
consideration.

(a) Not Adjusted for Testing

(b) Adjusted for Testing, 30 Day Horizon

2020. Colors range from green (representing 0) to red (representing 1). (a) not adjusted for
testing, infinite horizon, (b) adjusted for testing, 30 day horizon. All smoothing with Hamming
window, W=7.

Figure 11 amplifies two of these cases: South Dakota (which looks worse when considering
testing rates) and Georgia (which looks better). In particular, South Dakota shows a steady
decline in testing over roughly two weeks leading up to 20 June 2020, while Georgia has had
growth in testing.
The figure also illustrates the point of limiting the horizon: early reports of testing in many
jurisdictions suggest very low numbers, making testing-adjusted statistics misleading. Also, the
maxima in the distant past may not matter as much as a more recent history, such as in the
case of South Dakota.

Discussion

The mitigation score suggested here serves as a simple way to convey the effectiveness of
mitigation measures. It accommodates comparison of jurisdictions of widely varying size
because of local normalization and is tolerant of always-present perturbations in data
reporting. Where testing data is available, the simple mitigation score may be augmented,
becoming the testing-adjusted mitigation score.
The simple mitigation score may be applied to other statistics such as death counts and testing
scores.
One could choose any of a variety of smoothing kernels. The Hamming window was chosen
somewhat arbitrarily, but has the requisite slowly varying top with sharper skirts and has
smooth, but finite, tails. As Figures 6 and 7 show, this windowing provides some mitigation of
distracting reporting irregularities.
The author had initially planned to report the complement of the above definition of the
mitigation score, so that a value of 1 meant complete mitigation, and 0 meant no mitigation.
But others have pointed out that most people, especially the lay public, have become
accustomed to seeing values near zero as good and values near one as bad; hence, the current
definition.
