Abstract
In late 2019, a novel coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was identified
in Wuhan, China and later spread to every corner of the globe. Whilst
the number of infection-induced deaths in Ghana, West Africa are minimal
when compared with the rest of the world, the impact on the local health
service is still significant. Compartmental models are a useful framework for
investigating transmission of diseases in societies. To understand how the
infection will spread and how to limit the outbreak. We have developed a
modified SEIR compartmental model with nine compartments (CoVCom9)
to describe the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Ghana. We have
carried out a detailed mathematical analysis of the CoVCom9, including
the derivation of the basic reproduction number, R0 . In particular, we
have shown that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable
when R0 < 1 via a candidate Lyapunov function. Using the SARS-CoV∗

2 reported data for confirmed-positive cases and deaths from March 13 to
August 10, 2020, we have parametrised the CoVCom9 model. The results of
this fit show good agreement with data. We used Latin hypercube samplingrank correlation coefficient (LHS-PRCC) to investigate the uncertainty and
sensitivity of R0 since the results derived are significant in controlling the
spread of SARS-CoV-2. We estimate that over this five month period, the
basic reproduction number is given by R0 = 3.110, with the 95% confidence
interval being 2.042 ≤ R0 ≤ 3.240, and the mean value being R0 = 2.623.
Of the 32 parameters in the model, we find that just six have a significant
influence on R0 , these include the rate of testing, where an increasing testing
rate contributes to the reduction of R0 .

1. Introduction
The recent COVID-19 pandemic has caused a devastating burden on the
global economy. Since there are currently no widely-available vaccines to
bring down or reduce the infection levels on the susceptible human population, many governmental decision-makers worldwide have resorted to intensive non-pharmaceutical interventions such as wearing of face-masks, social
distancing, cleaning of suspected infected surfaces, avoiding crowded places,
the use of hand sanitizers. These non-pharmaceutical interventions have
significantly helped to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19.
Mathematical and statistical modelling tools are important in providing
key epidemiological parameters of infectious diseases such as infection or
transmission rate, recovery rate, incubation period, isolation and hospitalization rate, quarantine rate, disease-induced death rate, vaccination rate
(with other factors depending on the model formulation)(Chowell et al.,
2009). Using mathematical models, parametrised to confirmed reported
cases of infection, helps estimate the basic reproduction number, R0 which
is a crucial epidemiological parameter that determines whether the infection

2

persists in the population or dies out (Li et al., 2020b; Dietz, 1993; Ma, 2020;
Roberts and Heesterbeek, 2007; Chowell et al., 2004).
Nonlinear mathematical models have significantly contributed to the understanding of transmission dynamics of infectious diseases, see, e.g., (Hethcote, 2000; Chowell and Hyman, 2016; Brauer et al., 2008; Khan et al.,
2015), and the recent COVID-19 pandemic is of no exception (Blyuss and
Kyrychko, 2021; Giordano et al., 2020; Ali et al., 2020; Asamoah et al.,
2020; Mushayabasa et al., 2020; Ndairou et al., 2020; Gevertz et al., 2020;
Carcione et al., 2020). Qianying et al. (2020) have proposed and studied
a data-driven SEIR type epidemic for the recent COVID-19 outbreak in
Wuhan which captures the effects of governmental actions and individuals’
behaviour. This literature is growing rapidly; Abou-Ismail (2020) has reviewed the fundamentals in SIR/SEIR modelling of the recent COVID-19
outbreak; here we give a brief overview of literature relevant to our work.
Buonomo (2020) describes a susceptible-infected-recovered-infected compartmental model to investigate the effects of information-dependent vaccination behavior on COVID-19 infections. A simple SEIR COVID-19 epidemic
model with nonlinear incidence rates that capture governmental control has
been designed by Rohith and Devika (2020) to examine the dynamics of
the infectious disease in India. Pang et al. (2020) parametrise a nonlinear
SEIHR model to estimate the value and sensitivity of R0 using data from
Wuhan from December 31st, 2019. A classic SEIR epidemic is used to study
the spreading dynamics of the 2019 coronavirus disease in Indonesia (Annas
et al., 2020) using vaccination and isolation as model parameters. They constructed a Lyapunov function to conduct global stability of the disease-free
equilibrium point. A data-driven epidemiological model that examines the
effect of delay in the diagnosis of the deadly COVID-19 disease is formulated
and studied by Rong et al. (2020), who estimate parameters and performed
a out global sensitivity analysis of their model parameters on R0 .
A nonlinear SEIQR COVID-19 epidemic model is introduced by Zeb
et al. (2020) who present a local and global stability analysis for their model.
The spread of Covid19 in China due to undetected infections in is examined
by Ivorra et al. (2020). Chen et al. (2020) propose a model based on di3

viding the total population into five non-overlapping classes: susceptible,
exposed, infected (symptomatic infection), asymptomatic infected, and recovered. Sardar et al. (2020), investigate the effects of lockdown using an
SEIR model. Using reported cases of this highly infectious disease in some
cities and the whole of India, they performed a global sensitivity analysis on
the computed R0 .
The exposed and infectious epidemiological classes used in formulating
infectious diseases models mentioned above have been left as abstract concepts. In reality, especially regarding SARS-CoV-2, it is hard to distinguish
between individuals exposed to or infected with SARS-CoV-2, due to the
presence of asymptomatic carriers. In this present study, we introduce two
epidemiological classes, which are: (1) an identified group of exposed individuals suspected to be carriers of SARS-CoV-2 (denoted by Q); and,
(2) individuals who have been clinically confirmed-positive for SARS-CoV2 (denoted by P ). Those identified as suspected exposed individuals are
denoted by Q because they are quarantined as required by the COVID19 protocols in Ghana. Likewise, confirmed-positives (P ) are treated as
infectious individuals who have clinically tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
Introducing these distinctions in the epidemiological classes for SARS-CoV2 is vital for gaining an understanding of its transmission dynamics within
the Ghanaian population. Using published data from March 13 to August
10, 2020 (Ritchie, 2020), we have parametrised our model using a Monte
Carlo-least squares technique together with information derived from literature.
The purpose of this research is to investigate the transmission dynamics
of SARS-CoV-2 in Ghana using these more specific epidemiological classes to
estimate the basic reproduction number, R0 . We have used Latin-Hypercube
Sampling-Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (LHS-PRCC) technique to
quantify the uncertainty in R0 as well as to identify those parameters to
which R0 is most sensitive. We have organised the subsequent sections of
the paper as follows: in Section 2 we present a detailed formulation of an
epidemiological model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Ghana, together with
corresponding mathematical analysis of the positivity and boundedness of
4

solutions, a derivation of the basic reproduction number, and global stability
analysis of the disease-free equilibrium, which are given in Section 3. Section 4 is dedicated to parameter estimation and numerical simulation. The
uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of R0 and its implications are presented in Section 5, together with some simulations predicting possible future
dynamics of the epidemic. Finally, we give a brief discussion and conclusion
of the study in Section 6.
2. Formulation of the model
Compartmental models are useful means of qualitatively understanding
the dynamics of disease transmissions within a population (Martcheva, 2015;
Chowell et al., 2009). In formulating our compartmental model to gain insight into COVID-19 transmission dynamics, the total human population is
divided into nine distinct epidemiological classes which are summarised in
Table 1. The numbers of individuals in each category is treated as a continuous variable, the classes being: susceptible, S(t), exposed, E(t), infectious,
I(t), quarantined suspects Q(t), confirmed-positive P (t), hospitalised in the
ordinary ward H(t), hospitalised in the intensive care unit C(t), self-isolation
F (t) and recovered, R(t). The total number of individuals in the population
is thus given by
N (t) = S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + Q(t) + P (t) + H(t) + C(t) + F (t) + R(t). (2.1)

See Tables 1 and 2 for explanations of the parameters and variables used in the model,
respectively.

Figure 1 summarises the dynamic processes by which individuals pass
from one class to another. The susceptible class (S) represents individuals
not exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the exposed class (E) represents
individuals that have recently been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus so are
still in the incubation period and can infect others (that is, asymptomatic
individuals). An individual in an exposed class can infect another person
but with a probability lower than an individual in the infectious class (I).
This rate of infection is given by the nonlinear function f which depends
on the parameters ϕ, α1 , α2 , α3 , β1 , β2 , β3 . Individuals in an infectious class
show clear symptoms and have high infectivity. These individuals have not

7

yet been clinically confirmed-positive, and thus can spread the disease to
the susceptibles. Individuals in class Q are quarantined, that is, individuals identified to have had contact with an exposed individual and so might
be carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus (but this has not yet been confirmed),
this class also includes individuals not infected with SARS-CoV-2 but are
quarantined as a result of enforcement of COVID-19 protocols. These individuals may either enter the susceptible class if test is confirmed negative
or to the confirmed-positive class if confirmed to be infected.
Individuals in the confirmed-positive class P are carriers of the SARSCoV-2 virus who have had clinical confirmation of this status. These individuals may either enter the intensive care hospitalised class, or be admitted
to the ordinary hospitalised class or enter the self-isolated class after this
period. The rates of the these processes are governed by the parameters
γ1 , v1 , ρ1 , ρ2 , ρ3 . The individuals in the ordinary Hospitalised class shows
some level of sickness due to infection that need to be cared for at the ordinary ward. Though there is chance of entering into recovery class, these
individuals’ conditions may deteriorate causing them to enter the intensive
care hospitalised class. Individuals move between these categories with rates
determined by κ2 , κ3 , δ2 , η. These individuals can still infect other individuals who become exposed through close contact. Individuals in intensive care
(C) can still infect other individuals and have a high risk of dying (rates dj )
although improved care conditions may allow transfer to the ordinary ward
(H, at rate η).
Individuals in the self-isolated class (F ) are on medication at home and
can still infect other individuals. These individuals (F ) may either enter
the recovered class (R, at rate δ1 ) or enter the ordinary hospitalised class
(rate δ2 ). Individuals who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 virus enter
into the recovered class (R) but can be re-infected since there is no lifelong immunity, hence there is a flux from R to S with rate parameter τ .
We assume that individuals in all the compartments can die of COVID-19
(rates dj ) in addition to natural death (rate µ) with the exception of the
susceptible compartment with only natural death. A summary of all the
parameter definitions is given in Table 2.

The standard form of incidence which is formulated from the basic principles that effective transmission rates are independent of the population

9

size N for human diseases is used in this study (Martcheva, 2015; Hethcote,
2000). This principle has been shown in many studies to be a plausible
assumption (Hethcote, 2000). If α is the average number of sufficient contacts for transmission of an individual per unit time, then αI/N is the
average number of contacts with infectives per unit time of one susceptible, and (αI/N )S is the incidence. That is, the number of new cases per
unit time at time t due to susceptibles S(t) becoming infected (Hethcote,
2000). We use ϕ to denote the effective transmission rate from an infectious
individual while α1 , α2 , α3 , β1 , β2 and β3 denote the transmission probabilities, of exposed individuals, quarantine suspected exposed individuals,
confirmed-positive individuals, ordinary hospitalised individuals, intensive
care hospitalised individuals, and self-isolated individual, respectively. All
these probabilities lie between zero and one. The incidence is therefore given

In this paper, we will use the acronym CoVCom9 to indicate the nine compartments of the model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission pattern in Ghana given
by Equation (2.3). The epidemiologically feasible region of interest of the
model (2.3) is the domain defined by

(2.5)

In the following sections we present a mathematical analysis of the model
with respect to positivity and boundedness of the feasible region, Ω, as well
as various stability results and the epidemiological threshold of interest. In
the subsequent sections, we discuss a theorem demonstrating that solutions
of Equation (2.3) with initial condidtions (2.4) in Ω remain in Ω.
3. Mathematical analysis of CoVCom9 model
3.1. Positivity, boundedness and invariant region
The CoVCom9 model (2.3) depicts COVID-19 transmission dynamics in
the human population, so it is vital to show that variables in (2.3) remain
nonnegative and bounded for all time t ≥ 0 and do not leave the epidemiologically feasible region of interest, Ω.

11

Lemma 1 (Positivity and Boundedness). For any given nonnegative initial
conditions in Eq. (2.4), the CoVCom9 model (2.3) has a nonnegative solution {S(t), E(t), I(t), Q(t), P (t), H(t), C(t), F (t), R(t)} of the system (2.3)
for all time t ≥ 0 whenever the parameters are non-negative. Moreover
lim sup N (t) ≤

t→∞

Λ
.

(3.1)

Proof. Considering the first equation of the CoVCom9 model (2.3), one can
clearly see that
dS
≥ −(λ + µ)S,
dt
where

(3.2)



α1 E + I + α3 Q + α4 P + β1 H + β2 C + β3 F
λ=ϕ
N

Next, integrating Eq. (3.2), we find
 Z t

S(t) ≥ S0 exp − (λ(ζ) + µ)dζ

(3.3)

o

Therefore S(t) ≥ 0 for all t ≥ 0.
Following a similar argument, it can be shown that the rest of the model
variables have nonnegative solutions for all time t ≥ 0. That is, E(t) ≥ 0,
I(t) ≥ 0, Q(t) ≥ 0, P (t) ≥ 0, H(t) ≥ 0, C(t) ≥ 0, F (t) ≥ 0, R(t) ≥ 0,
∀t ≥ 0.
Furthermore, we prove that the solutions are bounded. Adding the righthand side of the CoVCom9 model (2.3) yields
dN
= Λ − µN − dE − d1 I − dU − d2 P − d3 H − d4 C − d5 F ≤ Λ − µN,
dt
(3.4)
Since dN/dt ≤ Λ − µN , it follows that
lim sup N (t) ≤

t→∞

Λ
.

(3.5)

Lemma 2 (Positively Invariant Region). The region defined by the closed
set, Ω in Eq. (2.5) is positively invariant for the model (2.3) with nonnegative initial conditions (2.4) whenever the parameters are nonnegative.
Proof. As in Lemma 1, it follows from the summation of all the equations
of the CoVCom9 model (2.3) that
dN
≤ Λ − µN.
dt

(3.6)

Using the initial condition N (0) > 0 and an integrating factor, we have
0 ≤ N (t) ≤

Λ
+ N (0) exp(−µt),
µ

(3.7)

where N (0) is the initial value of the total population. Thus N (t) ≤ Λ/µ,
as t → ∞. Therefore all feasible solutions of system (2.3) enter the region Ω
defined by (2.5), which is a positively invariant set of the system (2.3). This
implies that all solutions in Ω remain in Ω ∀t ≥ 0. It is therefore sufficient
to study the dynamics of CoVCom9 model system (2.3) in Ω.

3.2. The basic reproduction number and existence of equilibria
The CoVCom9 model has a disease-free equilibrium point given by
E0 = (S0 , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) ∈ Ω,

S0 =

Λ
.
µ

(3.8)

The basic reproduction number is defined as the number of secondary infections produced by a single infectious individual during the entire infectious
period (Van den Driessche and Watmough, 2002). In this study, the reproduction number defined as the number of secondary SARS-CoV-2 infections
generated by a single active SARS-CoV-2 individual during the entire infectious period. Mathematically, the basic reproduction number R0 is the
dominant eigenvalue of the next generation matrix (Diekmann et al., 2010;
Van den Driessche and Watmough, 2002). We apply the method formulation in (Van den Driessche and Watmough, 2002) to obtain an expression of
13

R0 for the proposed CoVCom9 (2.3). Let x = E, I, Q, P, H, C, F

the system (2.3) can be written in the form

asymptomatic individuals; the infected (symptomatic) group I (R0I ); asymptomatic quarantine suspected individuals - class-Q (R0Q ); confirmed positive
individuals - class P (R0P ); hospitalised cases (H, R0H ); intensive care (C)
cases, (R0C ); and those self-isolating at home (F , R0F ). Equation (3.15)
implies that intervention strategies of SARS-CoV-2 infections should target
those in classes E, I, Q, P , H, C, and F .
According to Theorem 3.2 of Van den Driessche and Watmough (2002),
the disease-free steady state E0 is locally asymptotically stable if R0 < 1
and unstable if R0 > 1. In the next section we provide stability results for
the disease-free equilibrium state.
3.3. Stability of disease free equilibrium (DFE)
In this section, we prove global stability results for the CoVCom9 model
(2.3). The epidemiological implication of the local stability is that a small
number of the infected individuals will not generate large outbreaks so in the
long run, resulting in SARS-CoV-2 dying out provided R0 < 1. The global
stability result helps demonstrate that the disappearance of SARS-CoV-2
disease is independent of the size of the initial subpopulations in the model,
provided R0 < 1 (Ali et al., 2020). The global stability of the disease-free
equilibrium, E0 is established using a candidate Lyapunov function.
Theorem 1. The disease-free equilibrium state, E0 of the CoVCom9 model
(2.3) is globally asymptotically stable in Ω if R0 < 1 and unstable if R0 > 1.
Proof. We construct a candidate Lyapunov function (3.17) for the CoVCom9
model (2.3) as
V (E, I, Q, P, H, C, F ) = Φ1 E +Φ2 I +Φ3 Q+Φ4 P +Φ5 H +Φ6 C +Φ7 F, (3.17)
where Φi , i = 1, 2, · · · , 7 are (as yet unknown) non-negative coefficients.
Since all the variables are bounded below by zero, then so is V . Assuming
that the variables are solutions of the model (2.3), the derivative of V with

in Ω if R0 < 1.
4. CoVCom9 model estimation and numerical simulations
4.1. Methodology
In this section, we briefly describe the parameter estimation and numerical simulation process used to investigate how well the proposed CoVCom9
model (2.3) agrees with the confirmed cases and deaths in Ghana. Here, we
consider the SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases and deaths from March 13, 2020
to August 10, 2020 as reported in Ghana. The data are obtained from Our
World in Data (Ritchie, 2020).
The CoVCom9 model (2.3) has nine state variables; to obtain the diseaseinduced mortality (D), we introduce the extra equation
dD
= d1 E + d2 I + d3 Q + d4 P + d5 H + d6 C + d7 F,
dt

(4.1)

which introduces no additional parameters. The CoVCom9 model has a
total of 35 parameters to estimate using limited data (confirmed-positive
cases and deaths only). This results in identifiability issues causing the nonconvergence of the optimisation of the objective function. We implement the
following practical principles to choose reasonable initial parameter values:
1. Expert review process which involves asking health experts and/or
consulting the relevant literature as well as individuals’ experience
of the infection. Accordingly, an estimate of the model parameters,
natural birth rate, µ, recruitment rate, Λ, incubation period, 1 , and
18

recovery rate of quarantine/self-isolation at home individual, δ1 are
obtained. We assumed that the life expectancy of people in Ghana
is estimated as 64.35 years (Asamoah et al., 2020), then the natural
death rate is estimated as µ = 1/(64.35 × 365) ≈ 4.258 × 10−5 per day.
The population of Ghana in 2020 is estimated to be N = 30, 960, 000 (,
GSS), and the recruitment rate of humans is estimated as Λ = µN ≈
1.318 × 103 people per day. The incubation period is 3–7 days, here we
choose 1 = 1/5.88 per day as estimated by Pang et al. (2020) which
is consistent with the wider literature (Anderson et al., 2020; Li et al.,
2020a). The self-isolated positive-confirmed individuals on medication
take 14 days on average to recover, thus we assume δ1 = 1/14 per day.
2. Exploring the model using the available data (also known as ‘system exploratory analysis’ (SEA) (Cside18, 2018)). This process helps
identify ranges of parameter values where the trajectories of the CoVCom9 are consistent with the data, and regions of parameter space
where trajectories deviate from the times series data of confirmedpositive cases and deaths. The motivation for this approach is to
restrict the ranges of the parameters and so reduce risk of the Monte
Carlo simulation getting trapped at a local optima. Since we have
31 remaining model parameters to infer, applying this SEA technique
yields upper and lower bounds for the model parameters which are
presented in (Table A.1).
We use a Monte Carlo least squares method to infer model parameter
since it is reliable and efficient. This method seeks to generate the best
Monte Carlo estimate (θbj ) of the model parameters (θ, listed in Table 2) by
minimising the error between the observed data (confirmed-positive cases
and deaths), Yj and the simulated data from the CoVCom9 model (2.3),
Yjsim given by the variables listed in Table 1. Denoting the total number of
data-points by n and using i (1 ≤ i ≤ M ) to enumerate the Monte Carlo

During parameter estimation, we use a logarithmically transformed parameter vector, log θ, since: (i) this conveniently ensures that all parameters
are positive, θ > 0; and (ii) this improves the numerical search of the parameter space across a wide range of θ (Bland and Altman, 1996; Acheampong
et al., 2019). All computations use MATLAB, 2018a .

In this section, the results obtained using the Monte Carlo least-squares
technique described in Section 4 are presented. Table 3 shows initial values
of the state variables; those for compartments E, I and Q are estimated from
the reported data. From Table 3, we infer that while on March 13, 2020 two
individuals are reported to be confirmed-positive of SARS-CoV-2 infection,
the corresponding number of individuals in the exposed (E), infectious (I)
and quarantine-suspected (Q) compartments are approximately 213, 1, and
3 respectively.
Table 4 gives the parameter values obtained together with their confidence intervals. We note that the infectivity of the individuals in the infected
compartment (I) is stronger than the other compartments: in decreasing
order, the infectivities are due to the groups E, F , Q, H, C, and P . The
overall transmission rate of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in Ghana for the
duration of the data considered in this study is ϕ =0.02495 per day, .

The corresponding best fits of the model to the reported data and the

of confirmed deaths simulated from the CoVCom9 model and the numbers from the report
data from March 13, 2020 to August 10, 2020.

The rate at which individuals transfer from Classes E to Q is 2 =
0.001144, indicating that each day only 0.11% of the individuals exposed to
the SARS-CoV-2 infection are identified with the suspicion of carrying the
infection, and can be contact traced and quarantine in order to clinically
confirm their status as either positive or negative of the infection. The
rate at which these suspected exposed individuals are confirmed positive is
estimated to be υ1 = 0.000524. For individuals confirmed-positive with the
SARS-CoV-2 infection, we can infer from Table 4 that the rate at which
individuals progress to Intensive Care (Class C) is low compared to the rate
at which they progress to either H or F Classes (standard hospital ward or
self-isolating at home), with the rate of progression from P to F Classes the
highest (that is from positive test to home isolation). The recovery rate of
individuals in Class H is estimated as κ1 = 0.008619 and the rate at which
these individuals losing immunity and becoming susceptible to the SARSCoV-2 infection is τ = 1.538×10−8 ; indicating that the rate of SARS-CoV-2
re-infection in Ghana is extremely low (full details of parameters and ranges
is given in Table 4).
23

From equation (3.15) and the parameter estimates in Table 4, the basic
reproduction number, R0 , is estimated to be 3.110. The breakdown of this
estimate is given, in decreasing order, by
• primarily, symptomatic individuals (class I, giving R0I = 2.417),
• hospitalised cases (class H, contributing R0H = 0.212),
• positively tested individuals (class P giving R0P = 0.207),
• infections due asymptomatic cases (class E, giving R0E = 0.123),
• self-isolating individuals (class F contributing R0F = 0.116),
• intensive care cases (class C, giving R0C = 0.020),
• those quarantined at home (class Q contributing R0Q = 0.015).
The basic reproduction number of COVID-19 based on the proposed CoVCom9 model for Ghana is higher than that of many other countries, which
indicates a greater epidemic risk in Ghana. A recent study by Asamoah et al.
(2020) provides a similar estimate of R0 in Ghana of 2.64, differs by only
15% from our estimate. However, the number of deaths reported in Ghana
is low compared to that of other countries in the world. For published values for other countries, please see Ali et al. (2020); Zeb et al. (2020); Brandi
et al. (2020); Mwalili et al. (2020); Kumar et al. (2020); Mushayabasa et al.
(2020); Götz and Heidrich (2020); Chen et al. (2020); Sardar et al. (2020);
Ivorra et al. (2020); Asamoah et al. (2020); Rahman et al. (2020).
Using the estimated parameter values given in Tables 3 and 4, the oneyear simulation transmission dynamics of the CoVCom9 model offers insight
into the SARS-CoV-2 among Ghanaian with respect to the COVID-19 protocols which are in place in the country. Figure 3 depicts the one-year
simulation dynamics for the classes E, I, Q, P , H, C, F , and deaths (D).

24

Fig. 3. One-year simulation dynamics of CoVCom9 model from March 13 2020 where E,
I, Q, P , H, C, F and D are respectively exposed, infectious, quarantine suspected-expose,
confirmed-positive, hospitalised at ordinary ward, hospitalised at intensive care unit, and
deaths with the vertical axis on a log-scale.

As shown in Figure 3, all state variables in the CoVCom9 model show
an increasing trend, indicating that Ghana continuing the same protocols
may not be enough to eradicate the SARS-CoV-2 infection. This has been
further complicated by theopening of the the borders, meaning that new
control measures are needed to mitigate the spread (both in and out). Our

25

projections show that with Ghana exercising current COVID-19 protocols
the actual cases substantially exceed those reported (whether hospitalised or
only positively tested). We thus expect the exponential growth to continue.
In the next section we discuss the derivation of the basic reproduction
number from the CoVCom9 model, and identify influential parameters that
intervention strategies should focus on in order to control the spread of the
virus.
5. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction
number
5.1. Methodology
The proposed CoVCom9 model (2.3) has many unknown parameters.
Due to the limited data available, there is substantial uncertainty in calibrating the values of the 31 CoVCom9 model (2.3) parameters (Marino et al.,
2008). However, in all cases the ratio of the upper bounds of the 95 % confidence interval is less than five times the lower bound, and more often four or
below, thus so the order of magnitude of all parameters is well established.
Since the intervals are derived using the logarithm of parameter values,
and our best estimates lie in the centre of this band, each upper bound is
approximately twice the estimate and the lower bound half of it. This uncertainty in model parameters results in some variability in the prediction
of the basic reproduction number R0 . Latin Hypercube Sampling-Partial
Rank Correlation Coefficient (LHS-PRCC) sensitivity analysis was used to
evaluate variabilities in the basic reproduction number R0 . The LHS-PRCC
approach provides an opportunity to examine the entire parameter space of
the CoVCom9 model (2.3) with computer simulations.
We analyse the impacts of the LHS parameters on the basic reproduction
number R0 of the CoVCom9 model (2.3) via standard Monte Carlo procedure. The key parameters to which R0 , given by (3.15), is most sensitive
are determined using the PRCCs values, suggesting the most effective way
of controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, this analysis also identifies

26

which parameters need to be known precisely when estimating R0 from data
(Marino et al., 2008).
The application of the combined LHS-PRCC methodology in infectious
disease modelling are fully described elsewhere, for example, in (Wu et al.,
2013; Marino et al., 2008). This method generally involves:
(i) generating LHS parameters in matrix form, together with a ranking of
outcome measures R0 ;
(ii) construction of two linear regression models in response to each parameter and outcome measure, and
(iii) computation of a Pearson rank correlation coefficient for the residuals
from the two regression models to obtain the PRCC values for that
particular parameter (Marino et al., 2008; Orwa et al., 2019).
We induce the correlation between the input parameters using the rankbased method of Iman and Conover (Iman and Conover, 1982). The correlation matrix for the 28 model parameters (listed in Table 2) is obtained
from the parameter estimation in Section 4, where no correlation is assumed
between the parameters 1 and δ1 and other parameters, since these two
parameters are not included in the parameter estimation.
5.2. Results of Analysing the LHS-PRCC for the CoVCom9 model
The result of the uncertainty analysis of the basic reproduction number,
R0 (3.15) of the CoVCom9 obtained by generating 1000 LHS samples using
the Monte Carlo technique is presented in Figure 4. This histogram depicts
the uncertainty in R0 , where the degree of uncertainty quantified via the
95% confidence intervals is indicated by the dashed lines. Figure 5 shows the
distribution of obtained values for R0 , the mean, 5th, and 95th percentiles
being respectively 2.623, 2.042, and 3.240.

27

Fig. 4. Uncertainty analysis of the basic reproduction number R0 depicted by the histogram with plot showing 95% confidence interval (dashed lines), mean (solid line) and an
estimate (red dotted-dashed line) of R0 (3.15).

Using the best-fit values of all the parameters given in Table 4 yields an
estimate of R0 towards the upper end of the distribution, namely a value of
3.110 (see the red dotted-dashed line). In general, the higher the uncertainty,
the wider the spread of the distribution of R0 . We note that there is some
uncertainty in R0 due to the model parameter estimates in Table 4; however,
this is less than for most parameters. In Table 4, for almost all parameters,
the upper and lower 95% confidence intervals differ from the best fit value by
a factor of two. However, for R0 , the upper and lower ends of the interval are
with ±24% of the mean value; thus overall, the uncertainty in the estimate
of R0 is less than that of the individual parameters.

28

Fig. 5. Sensitivity of the basic reproduction number R0 to changes in the CoVCom9
parameters using PRCC index.

Figure 5 shows the sensitivity of the reproduction number R0 to each
of the parameters in the underlying model (2.3). PRCC assigns each parameter a value between −1 and +1. The magnitude of PRCC shows the
parameter importance while the sign of PRCC gives the direction of the
relationship between the input parameter and the model output of interest.
Negative PRCC values mean that as the parameter value increases, the value
of the model output of interest decreases and vice versa. The results of the
PRCCs depicted help identify which parameters are primarily responsible
for the uncertainty in R0 , which suggests those interventions which should
be most efficacious in controlling the spread of the virus by reducing R0 .
A PRCC value of zero gives an indication of no association between the
input parameter and model output of interest. The most significant model
parameters are those associated with small p−values (p < 0.05) and large
magnitude PRCC values (0.5 ≤ |P RCC| ≤ 1).
From Figure 5, we identify six parameters as most influential on the
basic reproduction number, R0 , these are:
• ϕ - the transmission rate of infectious individuals,
• α2 - the probability of transmission of quarantine suspected infectious
individuals,
29

• α3 - the probability of transmission of confirmed-positive infectious
individuals,
• 1 - the progression rate of exposed individuals to infectious class
• γ1 - the progression rate of infectious individuals to confirmed-positive
class, and
• υ1 - the progression rate of quarantine suspected infectives to the class
of confirmed-positive cases.
In particular, R0 increases with increases in ϕ, α2 and α3 , while R0 decreases
with increases in 1 , γ1 and υ1 . It is therefore critical that intervention
strategies should be aimed at decreasing the values of ϕ, α2 and α3 and
increasing the values of 1 , γ1 and υ1 .
These recommendations should not be interpreted as discounting the
value of considering efforts to alter other significant model parameters such
as probability of transmission of hospitalised individuals at ordinary ward
(β1 ), the progression rate of exposed individuals to quarantine suspected
exposed class (2 ), and recovery rate of hospitalised individual (κ1 ).
5.3. Predicting the effects of lockdown
The simulation presented in Figure 3 show a worrying trend of exponential growth with no sign of plateau or reduction in the effects of the
pandemic. Many countries have implemented a ‘lockdown’, that is regulations to restrict social interactions and so reduce the spread of the disease.
Here, we model the effects of lockdown by a simple reduction in the parameter ϕ, and simulate the spread by solving the model using the standard
value of ϕ for the first 350 days, and a lower value of ϕ for the time period
350 ≤ t ≤ 700 days. The results are presented in Figures 6, 7, 8, for the
values ϕ = 0.008, 0.016, 0.004, the first value of ϕ being chosen so as to
reduce the expected value of R0 from 3.110 to 0.995, the threshold required
for containment of the epidemic. The second and third values are chosen
to be double and half of this critical value. Note that the vertical scales in
Figures 6, 7, and 8 are not identical.

there is a 68% reduction in ϕ, that is, to ϕ = 0.008. Here E, I, Q, P , H, C, F and D
are respectively exposed, infectious, quarantine suspected-expose, confirmed-positive, hospitalised at ordinary ward, hospitalised at intensive care unit, and deaths with the vertical
axis on a log-scale. R0 changes from 3.110 to 0.995.

Figure 6 shows a clear almost instant reduction in the number of exposed people (E), followed by a plateau, whilst the sizes of most other
sub-populations plateau. However, the numbers of hospitalised cases (H
and C) both continue to rise slowly. We see that this strength of lockdown
stops the exponential growth. The less severe lockdown simulated in Figure
31

7 causes a brief reduction in the number of exposed cases; however, the exponential growth is quickly resumed, in the size of all sub-populations, albeit
with a slightly smaller growth rate. The more severe lockdown simulated
in Figure 8 shows a sudden and sharp reduction in the number of exposed
(E), followed by a steady exponential decrease. The numbers of infected,
quarantined and positive cases is also seen to fall exponentially, whilst the
cases of hospitalised, intensive care, and self-isolated all plateau, as the total
number of deaths slowly increases.

there is a 34% reduction in ϕ, that is, to ϕ = 0.016. Again, E, I, Q, P , H, C, F and D
are respectively exposed, infectious, quarantine suspected-expose, confirmed-positive, hospitalised at ordinary ward, hospitalised at intensive care unit, and deaths with the vertical
axis on a log-scale. The effect on R0 is a change from 3.110 to 2.053.

It should be noted that these simulations are only a crude model of
the effects of lockdown, in reality a lockdown could cause changes to other
parameters, particularly α1 , α2 , α3 , β1 , β2 , β3 , in the formula (2.2) for the
spread of the disease. We leave the topic of more detailed models of the
effects of lockdown for future work.

and D are respectively exposed, infectious, quarantine suspected-expose, confirmed-positive,
hospitalised at ordinary ward, hospitalised at intensive care unit, and deaths with the vertical axis on a log-scale. The effect on R0 is a change from 3.110 to 0.498.

6. Discussion and conclusions
We have developed a mathematical model (CoVCom9) in the form of a
system of coupled ordinary differential equations to describe SARS-CoV-2
transmission dynamics in Ghana. This categorises every member of the pop34

ulation into one of 9 classes, including various classes well-defined and measurable classes, such as those who have tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 and
are hospitalised (ordinary wards/intensive care), quarantined, etc, as well as
unmeasurable but clinically important classes, such as those who have been
exposed to the virus, those who are infectious but not yet tested positive.
We investigated the epidemiological well-posedness of the CoVCom9 model,
shown that solutions remain positive, and analysed the stability of the equilibrium solution. Using a candidate Lyapunov function, we have shown that
the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when the basic
reproduction number is R0 < 1.
Using the reported data (Ritchie, 2020) from March 13, 2020, to August
10, 2020, for both confirmed-positive cases and deaths of SARS-CoV-2 disease, we have parameterised the CoVCom9 model, with other parameters
being estimated based from the literature. During the parameter estimation
exercise, we used system exploratory analysis (SEA) to find practical parameter spaces. The estimated parameter values provided best fits that are
in good agreement with both reported confirmed-positive cases and deaths.
Also, the results point that on March 13, 2020, while two individuals are
confirmed-positive, approximately 213, 3, and 1 persons were respectively
exposed, quarantine suspected and infectious.
We have used Latin Hypercube Sampling-Rank Correlation Coefficient
(LHS-PRCC) to investigate the uncertainty and sensitivity of the reproduction number R0 . The results derived are of significant epidemiological value
in SARS-CoV-2 control. We estimate that over the period, March-August
2020, the average basic reproduction number for Ghana was R0 = 3.110,
which has the 95% confidence percentile interval (2.042 - 3.240, in approximate centre of this interval is the mean value of 2.623). From Figure 5, we
note that R0 is most sensitive to six model parameters (ϕ, α2 , α3 , 1 , γ1 ,
and υ1 whose effects are detailed in Table 2).
The proposed CoVCom9 model is a result of our effort to gain insight into
the vital features of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Ghana. Future
work will be focused on extending the model to account for inflow into other
classes due to opening of Ghana’s borders. Further, we will consider time35

dependent optimal control intervention strategies to gain insight into the
best strategy for Ghana. Other extensions include the time-dependent force
of infection and the maximum capacity of intensive care units.

Appendix A. Appendix
In Table A.1 we list the parameter values used in the simulations presented in Section 4.
Figures A.1, A.2, A.3 show our predictions for how the subpopulation
sizes in the model would have evolved over time if a lockdown had been
imposed as soon as the first cases entered Ghana. These predictions are
obtained by keeping all parameters at the same values as in the main model,
and reducing ϕ to the values used in Section 5.3. These graphs should be
compared with Figure 3. In Figure A.1 we use ϕ = 0.008, which is chosen
to make our estimate of R0 = 1. We see that this has the effect of bringing
the pandemic under some sort of control, but only over an extremely long
timescale. In Figure A.2 we simulate a partial lockdown, that is, reducing
ϕ to 0.016 - which is the midpoint of the standard value ϕ = 0.02495 and
that required to reduce R0 to 1. We see that epidemic still grows, but at
a slower rate than with no lockdown. Finally, in Figure A.3, we consider
the effect of a much more severe lockdown, where ϕ is reduced to half that
36

needed for R0 = 1, that is ϕ = 0.004. This suggests that the epidemic can
be controlled and eliminated within a year.
