ABSTRACT
We use rank correlations as distance functions to establish the interconnectivity between stock returns, building weighted
signed networks for the stocks of seven European countries, the US and Japan. We establish the theoretical relationship
between the level of balance in a network and stock predictability, studying its evolution from 2005 to the third quarter of
2020. We find a clear balance-unbalance transition for six of the nine countries, following the August 2011 Black Monday in
the US, when the Economic Policy Uncertainty index for this country reached its highest monthly level before the COVID-19
crisis. This sudden loss of balance is mainly caused by a reorganization of the market networks triggered by a group of
low capitalization stocks belonging to the non-financial sector. After the transition, the stocks of companies in these groups
become all negatively correlated between them and with most of the rest of the stocks in the market. The implied change in
the network topology is directly related to a decrease in stocks predictability, a finding with novel important implications for
asset allocation and portfolio hedging strategies.

Keywords: rank correlations, signed networks, structural balance, stock predictability, complex networks

Introduction
The complex nature of the stock market is condensed in the phrase: “Economists are as perplexed as anyone by the behavior
of the stock market”1. Understanding this complex behavior–characterized by a combination of saw-tooth movements and
low-frequency upward and downward switches2 –is a major goal in finance. However, the importance of stock markets goes
beyond finance to impact macroeconomic modeling and policy discussion3 . In fact, it has been recognized that the stock
market is a good predictor of the business cycle and of the components of gross national product of a given country3. Special
emphasis has been placed on understanding the role of risk and uncertainty in stock markets from different perspectives4–16 ,
with a focus on security pricing and corporate investment decisions. At the end of the day, as said by Fischer and Merton3: in
the absence of uncertainty, much of what is interesting in finance disappears.
As the majority of complex systems, stock markets have an exoskeleton formed by entities and complex interactions,
which give rise to the observed patters of the market behavior17–20 (see Ref.21 for a review of the recent research in financial
networks and their practical applicability). For the same set of entities, there are different forms to define the connectivity
between them. A typical way of connecting financial institutions is by means of borrowing/lending relations21–24 . However, in
the case of stock markets, where stocks represent the nodes of the network, the inter-stock connectivity is intended to capture
the mutual trends of stocks over given periods of times. Mantegna25 proposed to quantify the degree of similarity between
the synchronous time evolution of a pair of stock prices by the correlation coefficient
ρi j between the two stocks i and j.
p
Then, this correlation coefficient is transformed into a distance using: di j = 2 (1 − ρi j ). Mantegna’s approach has been
widely extended in econophysics26 where it is ubiquitous nowadays as a way to define the connectivity between stocks. This
approach has been used for instance for the construction of networks to analyze national or international stock markets27–32 .
A characteristic feature of this approach is that although ρi j ∈ [−1, 1], the distance di j used as a weight of the links between
stocks is nonnegative. This allows the use of classical network techniques for their analysis (see Ref.33 for a review). To avoid
certain loss of information inherent to the previous approach34, Tse et al.35 decide that an edge exists between a pair of stocks
only if ρi j > |z| for a given threshold z, which however retains the nonnegativity of the edge weights.

The importance of allowing explicit distinction between positive and negative interdependencies of stocks, which is lost
in the previous approaches, was recently remarked by Stavroglou et al.36 . They built separated networks based on positive
and negative interdependencies. This separation may still hide some important structural characteristics of the systems under
analysis. Fortunately, there is an area of graph theory which allows to study networks with simultaneous presence of positive
and negative links. These graphs, known as signed graphs, are known since the end of the 1950’s37 (see Ref.38 for a review),
but only recently have emerged as an important tool in network theory9, 39, 40, 42, 43 . A focus on signed networks has been the
theory of social balance37, 44 . It basically states that social triads where the three edges are positive (all-friends) or where two
are negative and one is positive–the enemy of my enemy should be my friend–are more abundant in social systems than those
having all-negative, or two positive and one negative ones. The first kind of networks are known as balanced, and the second
ones as unbalanced (see Refs.9, 39, 40, 42, 43 for applications).
Here we introduce the use of signed networks to represent stock markets of nine developed countries and to study the
degree of balance. First note that in finance, the time varying behavior of networks is an important characteristic, since
the time varying comovements become a risk factor3. Hence, we analyze the time variation of the degree of balance on stock
networks between January 2005 and September 2020, thus addressing a gap pointed out in a recent study21. To build the graphs
we use the rank correlations between stocks, which provide a measure of similarity better suited for financial distributions.
We find a balance-unbalance transition (BUT) in six of the countries studied. The BUTs occur around September/October
2011 for the US, Greece, Portugal, Ireland, and Spain, and later in France, which take place just after the Black Monday in
August 2011. Neither Germany, nor Italy, nor Japan showed clear signs of this BUT. We discover that the observed BUTs are
mainly triggered by a reorganization of the topology of the stock market networks. They consist on the movement of a few low
capitalization stocks from the periphery to the center of the networks by forming cliques of fully-negative interdependencies
among them and with most of the rest of the stocks in the market. These transitions impact directly on the naive predictability
of stock prices from pairwise rank correlations. This is a novel finding with a direct impact on optimal asset allocation and
hedging, which opens promising avenues for future research.

Theoretical Approaches
Correlations and predictability of interrelated stock prices
To study the similarity between stock price changes we consider the time series of the log returns of stocks, Yi (t) = log [Pi (t) /Pi (t − 1)] ,
where Pi (t) is the daily adjusted closing price of the stock i at time t. Let us consider the log return of three stocks forming
the vectors Y1 , Y2 and Y3 , such that Yi = [Yi (1) , · · · ,Yi (S)]T . The similarity between the orderings of the log returns YA and YB
of two stocks A and B can be captured by the Kendall’s tau

τ = 2P

YA − YA′





YB − YB′ > 0 − 1,

(1)

where Yℓ′ is an independent copy of the vector Yℓ , ℓ = A, B, and P(X) is the probability of the event X. If two rankings are
concordant, τ > 0, if two rankings are independent, τ = 0, and if the two rankings are discordant, τ < 0.
When considering the correlations between three stocks forming a triad there are four cases that can emerge: (i) the three
pairs of stocks are correlated: τ (Y1 ,Y2 ) > 0, τ (Y1 ,Y3 ) > 0 and τ (Y2 ,Y3 ) > 0; (ii) one pairs of stocks is correlated and two
pairs are anticorrelated: τ (Y1 ,Y2 ) > 0, τ (Y1 ,Y3 ) < 0 and τ (Y2 ,Y3 ) < 0; (iii) two pairs of stocks are correlated and one pair is
anticorrelated: τ (Y1 ,Y2 ) > 0, τ (Y1 ,Y3 ) > 0 and τ (Y2 ,Y3 ) < 0; (iv) the three pairs of stocks are anticorrelated: τ (Y1 ,Y2 ) < 0,
τ (Y1 ,Y3 ) < 0 and τ (Y2 ,Y3 ) < 0.
Let us focus on estimating the trend of one of the stocks from another in the correlation triad considering
a time varying

regression model (see Appendix B in the Supplementary Information (SI)). Let us write Ŷi (t) Y j6=i (t) for the nonparametric
smoothed estimate of Yi from Y j : Ŷi (t) = m̂i (Y j (t)), where mi (·) is a non-specified unknown function. Then, for any stock, e.g.,
Y1 , we can make two predictions from another stock, e.g., Y2 . One of them
 is simply Ŷ1 (t) (Y2 (t)),and the other is using first

Y2 to estimate Y3 , and then estimate Y1 from the last, i.e., Ŷ1 (t)
Ŷ
(Y
(t))
, that is Ŷ1 (t) = m̂1 
Ŷ3 (t) , where Ŷ3 (t) = m̂3 Y2 (t) .
 3 2

In the cases (i) and (iii) the trends of Y1 estimated by Ŷ1 (t) Y2 (t) and by Ŷ1 (t) m̂3 Y2 (t) are the same. In the case (iii)




Ŷ1 (t) Y2 (t) estimates an increase of Y1 with the increase of Y2 , while Ŷ1 (t) m̂3 Y2 (t) estimates a decrease of Y1 with the
increase of Y2 . Therefore, observing the trend evolution of Y2 does not clearly estimate the trend of Y1 independently of the
quality of the pairwise rank correlations. In other words, the trend of Y1 is unpredictable from Y2 . A similar situation occurs
for the case (iv).
In closing, the “predictability” of the trend of a stock Yi from that of Y j increases when the signs of the two estimations coincide. Otherwise, such predictability drops as a consequence of the different trends predicted by Ŷi (t) (Y j (t)) and
2



Ŷi (t) m̂k Y j (t) . If we represent the three stocks at the vertices of a triangle and the signs of the estimates as the corre-

sponding edges, we have that the four cases analyzed before can be represented as in Fig. 1. Because the magnitude of τi j (t)
quantifies the quality of the estimation for each t, we suggest to replace the edges of the triangles in Fig. 1 by the corresponding values of the Kendall’s tau instead of their estimates signs (for more details see Appendix B in the SI). In this case, a
measure of the predictability of the stocks in a given triad is given by K̃(t) = τi j (t)τik (t)τ jk (t), with K̃(t) → +1 corresponding
to larger predictability and with K̃(t) → −1 to poorer predictability at time t. Obviously, we should extend this measure
beyond triangles, which is what we do in the next Section.

Figure 1. Graphical representation interdependencies between stocks Y1 , Y2 and Y3 in a triad.
A triangle like those illustrated in Fig. 1 is known as a signed triangle. A signed triangle for which the product of its edge
signs is positive is known as a balanced triangle (cases (i) and (ii) in Fig. 1). Otherwise, it is said to be unbalanced (cases (iii)
and (iv) in Fig. 1). These concepts are naturally extended to networks of any size by means of the concept of signed graphs
(see next Section). A signed graph where all the triangles (more generally all its cycles) are balanced is said to be balanced.
Therefore, we move our scenario of stock predictability to that of the analysis of balance in signed stock networks.
Balance in Weighted Signed Stock Networks
Let the stocks in a given market be represented as a set of nodes V in a graph G = (V, E,W ), where E ⊆ V ×V is a set of edges
which represent the correlations between pairs of stocks, and W : E → [−1, +1] is a mapping that assigns a value between −1
and +1 to each edge. We call these graphs weighted signed stock networks (WSSNs). The edges of the WSSN are defined
on the basis of time varying Kendall’s tau between the log returns of the stocks. The details about the edges definition and the
adjacency matrix construction of the WSSN are given in Appendix A of the SI.
For any cycle in a WSSN we will say that it is positive if the product of all Kendall’s taus forming the edges of the cycle is
positive. A WSSN is balanced if all its cycles are positive. However, the question is not to reduce the problem to a yes or not
classification but to quantify how close or far a WSSN is from balance. To do so, we consider a hypothetical scenario in which
a given WSSN G = (V, E,W ) has evolved from a balanced network G′ = (V, E, |W |). That is, we are interested in quantifying
the departure of a given WSSN from a balanced version of itself. We define the equilibrium constant K for the equilibrium
G′ ⇄ G as: K = exp (−β △F), where β = (kB T )−1 with kB a constant and T the temperature, and △F is the change of the
Gibbs free energy of the system9 . The equilibrium constant is bounded as 0 < K ≤ 1, with the lower bound indicating a large
departure of the WSSN from its balanced analogous and reaching K = 1 when it is balanced. We prove in Appendix C of the
SI that this K is related to K̃, which was defined in the previous section to account for the product of the signs of all edges in
the cycles of the WSSN.
To calculate balance in a signed network, Facchetti et al.40 used an intensive computational technique that assigns a +1 or
a −1 to all the nodes so as to minimize the energy functional
Hˆ (Γ) := −

∑

Jvw σv σw ,

(2)

(v,w)∈E

where σk ∈ {+1, −1}, k = 1, . . . , n with n equal to the number of nodes and Jvw accounts for the sign of the edge in the
signed graph. Here we use a different approach, which avoids the minimization of that energy functional, and which is based
on the free energies F (G) and F (G′ ) appearing in △F = F (G) − F (G′ ). In this case, we notice that the energy functional
(2) is minimized if Jvw σv σw > 0 and maximized if Jvw σv σw < 0. Therefore, we identify this term with the Kendall’s tau:
Jvw σv σw := τvw , which means that Hˆ (Γ) = −A (Γ), such that correlated pairs of stocks contribute to the minimization of the
3

energy functionaland 
anticorrelated
ones contribute in the opposite direction. Then, we have △F = −β ln (Z (G) /Z (G )),
where Z (Γ) = tr exp −β Hˆ (Γ) .

For the current work we consider the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index12 as a proxy for the inverse temperature
β . EPU is compiled for every country on a monthly basis and represents a level of “agitation” of the market at a given date.
We then define a relative inverse temperature as: βrel = EPU/ max(EPU), where max (EPU) is the maximum EPU reported
for that country in the period of analysis. In this case the risk is high when the “temperature” of the system at a given time is
approaching the maximum temperature reached by that country in the whole period, βrel → 1. On the other hand, the risk is
minimum when the temperature at a given time is much smaller that the maxim temperature of the period, βrel → 0.
This finally gives our measure of structural balance for an WSSN9, 47 :

In the Supplementary Information we prove that K = 1 if and only if the WSSN is balanced. The departure of K from
unity characterizes the degree of unbalace that the WSSN has.

Results
We study the stock markets of France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Japan, Portugal, Spain, and the US during the period between January 2005 and September 2020 (for more details about the data see SI, Appendix D). The first interesting
observation is the large balance observed for all markets between January 2005 and August 2007, when all of them display
K ≥ 0.98. However, in five countries there are sudden drops of balance around September/October 2011. This transition from
highly balanced to poorly balanced markets occurs in Ireland in September 2011 and in the US, Portugal, Greece and Spain
in October 2011. The transitions are observed by naked eye in the plots of the temporal evolution of balance (see top panels
of Fig. 2(a-e)). For a quantitative analysis of these BUTs as well as the identification of the dates at which they occurred
we use the detrended cumulative sums (DCS) of the balance (see Fig. 2). In these five markets the general trend is a decay
of the balance from 2005 to 2020. Therefore, the DCS increases for those periods in which the balance does not follow the
general trend, i.e., when it does not decay with time. A negative slope of the DCS in some periods indicates that the balance
drops more abruptly during this period than the general decreasing trend. Then, we can observe that DCS has a positive slope
in all five markets with BUT between January 2005 and September/October 2011. At this point, the DCS changes its slope
indicating an abrupt decay of balance. We select the point in which this change of slope occurs as the date marking the BUT.
We should notice that there are some differences in the behavior of the DCS in each specific market. The US, Portugal and
Greece display an initial increasing period followed by a continuous decay one. Ireland displays a short period in which DCS
has slope slightly positive but close to zero between September 2011 and January 2016 when it definitively starts to decay.
The market in Spain interrupted the decay of its balance on April 2017 when it starts to recover balance at a rate similar to the
one of the period between January 2005 to October 2011. The value of the balance drops dramatically again after the crisis
produced by COVID-19 as can be seen in Fig. 2 (e). Finally, we have included the stock market of France in Fig. 2 (f) because
it displays a behavior similar to that of Spain, although the BUT occurs significantly later with respect to the other countries
in this group, i.e., on September 2012.
The markets of Germany, Italy and Japan display very constant values of their balance across the whole period of analysis.
Although there are some oscillations at certain specific dates, their DCS display an almost zero slope confirming the constancy
of the balance of these markets (see Fig. 3).

Discussion
Among the factors that may influence the BUT in six out of nine countries studied, we should mention the global level of risk
at which a given market is exposed to at a given time. We account for this factor through the parameter 0 < βrel ≤ 1, which is
based on the relative EPU index. Following our theoretical model, when the level of global risk is very low, βrel → 0, we have
that K → 1 and the corresponding WSSN tends to be balanced independently of its topology and edge weights. The analysis
of the relative EPU values for all countries indicates that the level of risk accounted for by this indicator was relatively low
from January 2005 to August 2007. This is exactly the same period for which a high balance was observed in all markets
with K ≥ 0.97. However, the relative EPU indices alone are not able to explain the BUTs observed in most markets around
September/October 2011. For instance, the relative EPU index peaked at different values for different markets: Portugal
(June 2016), the US (May 2020), Spain (October 2017), France (April 2017), Greece (November 2011) and Ireland (May

2020). It has been found that the US EPU can achieve better forecasting performance for foreign stock markets than the own
national EPUs. This is particularly true during very high uncertainty episodes18 (see Appendix E in the SI for more details
and references). Following this empirical observation, we can speculate that a plausible cause that triggered the BUT in five
European countries were the events of August 2011, when the US EPU index rocketed to its highest value between 2005 and
the COVID-19 crisis.
The topological analysis of BUT should necessarily start by considering the role of negative interdependencies. It is obvious that they are necessary for unbalance, i.e., a totally positive network cannot be unbalanced. However, it has been widely
demonstrated in the mathematical literature that this is not a sufficient condition for unbalance, i.e., there are networks with
many negative edges which are balanced42, 47 . As an illustrative example let us consider the WSSN of the US of September
3, 2010, which has 950 negative edges and a balance of K ≈ 0.245 indicating its lack of balance. However, the US WSSN of
February 18, 2011 also has 950 negative edges, but it is balanced with K ≈ 0.946. Similarly, the WSSN of Portugal on July 6,
2012 (K ≈ 0.700) and on May 3, 2019 (K ≈ 0.407), both have 720 negative edges. The ratio of negative to total edges is neither a sufficient condition for balance. For instance, in Spain on August 12, 2005 the market was perfectly balanced (K = 1),
while on September 2007 it was unbalanced (K ≈ 0.142), although both WSSNs have the same proportion of negative to total
edges, i.e., 1.4%.
A detailed exploration of the WSSNs with low balance occurring after BUT (see Fig. 2) revealed the existence of small
6

fully-negative cliques (FNC) formed by a group of


of s stocks is K = exp (−βrel (s−1))+(s−1) eβrel / exp (βrel (s−1))+(s−1) e−βrel , which for a fixed value of βrel clearly
tends to zero as s → ∞. Therefore, the unbalanced nature of the post-transition structure of stock markets is mainly due to the
presence of these cliques of mutually anti-correlated stocks. Additionally, each of the stocks in the FNC increases significantly
its number of negative connections with the rest of stocks after BUT (see Fig. 4), being also negatively connected to almost
every other stock in the WSSN. This subgraph resembles a kind of graph known as complete split graph (CSG)49 .
To explore the determinants of the lack of balance in these networks we simulate the structure of the networks displaying
BUT by means of a quasi-CSG-WSSN (see Appendix F in the SI for details) and compare it with a simulated random WSSN.
The quasi-CSG-WSSNs have the same number of nodes and edges as the WSSNs but the size of the central clique is variable.
We determine the “optimal” value of the sizes in the simulated networks, sopt , by minimizing the root mean square error
(RMSE) between the spectrum of the real WSSN and that of the quasi-CSG-WSSN. In SI Appendix F, Table S1, we report
that the RSME of the random model is about twice bigger than that of the quasi-CSG for the six countries where BUT
occurs. This clearly indicates that the topological organization, more than the number of positive/negative connections, is
what determines the lack of balance in these networks.
The size of the FNC correlates very well with the intensity of the drop in the mean values of K before and after the BUT
(r ≈ 0.857). Two other important characteristics of these FNC are that: (i) they are mainly formed by non-financial entities
(see SI Appendix F, Table S1), and (ii) they are composed by small and micro-caps with the exception of SAR in Greece
which is a mid-cap. We have shown (see Appendix G in the SI) that if we split the WSSN by financial (F) and non-financial
(NF) sectors, then the BUT is observed mainly for the networks containing NF-NF interactions.
All in all, these BUTs change the predictability of the stocks in the way we have explained in Section from more predictable markets to more unpredictable ones.

Conclusions
Considering stock-stock correlations in stock markets as signed graphs allowed us to introduce the concept of balance into
stock market networks for the first time. We related the level of balance in these networks with stock predictability, and
identified a previously unknown transition between balanced markets to unbalanced ones in six out of nine countries studied.
These balance-unbalance transitions occur in the US, Greece, Portugal, Spain, and Ireland around September 2011, following
the Black Monday, and later on in France. No transition is observed in the stock markets of Germany, Italy and Japan for the
same period of time. The balance-unbalance transition is driven by a reorganization of the stock-stock correlations of a group
of low capitalization stocks, mostly of non-financial entities which collapse into a fully-negative clique of anticorrelated pairs
of stocks. Further studies are needed to understand the reasons and implications of this reorganization of non-financial entities
in a given number of markets, and the associated loss of network balance and stock predictability.

Methods
A. Weighted Signed Stock Networks
In order to define the weight of the edges in the WSSN we use Kendall’s tau rank correlation coefficients. For two stocks A
and B in a given market, our interest is to investigate whether the relationship between the stock log returns (YA ,YB )T changes
with time. In this context, copulas are very useful since they give a flexible structure for modeling multivariate dependences1.
Let FA , FB and, F be the continuous marginals and the joint distribution function of (YA ,YB )T . Then, based on Sklar’s theorem2,
there is a unique copula function C(·, ·,t) : [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] such that F(yAt , yBt ,t) = C(FA (yAt ,t), FB (yBt ,t),t) for any y jt ∈ Y j ,
j = A, B. Therefore, time varying Kendall’s tau is defined in terms of copulas as

τA,B (t) = 4

Z

[0,1]2

C(u1 , u2 ,t)dC(u1 , u2 ,t)−1,

where (u1 , u2 ) ∈ [0, 1]2 . To estimate the time varying dependence, a nonparametric estimation method is used because of its
advantage of overcoming the rigidity of parametric estimators. Specifically, it allows to remove the restriction that the joint
distribution function belongs to a parametric family. In this line, Ascorbebeitia et al.3 propose to estimate the time varying
copula C(u1 , u2 ,t) as
1 S
Ĉ(u1 , u2 ,t) =
∑ wh (t − s)I{YA(s) ≤ F̂A−1 (u1,t),YB (s) ≤ F̂B−1 (u2,t)},
Sh s=1
where wh (t − s) = (Sh)−1 k ((t − s) / (Sh)) is a sequence of kernel weights that smooths over the time space, h > 0 is the
bandwidth that regulates the degree of smoothness, F̂j (y,t) = (Sh)−1 ∑Ss=1 wh (t − s)I{Y j (s) ≤ y} denotes the nonparametric
time varying estimator of the j-marginal distribution, and I {·} is the indicator function. They also derive the following
consistent nonparametric estimator for the time varying Kendall’s tau under α - mixing local stationary variables:

τ̂A,B (t) =

4

S

∑

1 − ∑Ss=1 wh (t − s)2 s,r=1

wh (t − s)wh (t − r)I {YA (s) < YA (r),YB (s) < YB (r)} − 1

(S1)


In all our calculations we consider the Epanechnikov kernel k (x) = 34 1 − x2 I {|x| < 1}. This kernel assigns a higher weight
to those values of the indicator function that are close in time and lower weights to observations of the indicator farther away
from t. The smoothing parameter h is selected minimizing the mean squared error of the Kendall’s tau estimator in (S1) (for
more details about the estimators see Ref.3 ).
Let us now fix t and calculate τ̂i j (t) for every pair of stocks (i, j) in a given market and define the rank correlations matrix M (t) whose entries are the values of τ̂i j (t). Let ε ∈ R+ be a given threshold. We create the matrix A (t) whose entries
are Ai j (t) = τ̂i, j (t) I{ τ̂i, j (t) ≥ ε }. Different candidates of the threshold have been considered and after some robustness
checks ε = 0.3 has been selected. The matrix A (t) is then the adjacency matrix of a Weighted Signed Stock/Equities Network
(WSSN) at time t. Here we construct weighted adjacency matrices based on daily returns from January 2005 until September
2020. Therefore, we have a set of WSSNs obtained with matrices A = {A (t = 1) , . . . , A (t = S)}.

B. Time Varying Nonparametric Regression
Let us consider the following regression model Yi (t) = mi (Y j (t)) + εi (t), where t = 1, ..., S, Yi (t) is the dependent variable,
mi (·) is a non-specified unknown smooth function, Y j6=i (t) is the explanatory variable and εi (t) is the error term. As pointed out
in several studies (see, e.g., Refs.4–6 ), the time varying behavior of the variables is an important characteristic in finance to take
into account. Since financial variables are dependent and not stationary, a nonparametric estimator for the regression model
that accounts for time variation is considered under local stationary and α -mixing variables7. The time varying estimator of
mi (y jt ) for any y jt ∈ Y j is defined as
!−1

S

m̂i (y jt ) =

∑ wh (t − s)wh(y jt − Y j (s))

s=1

S

∑ wh (t − s)wh (y jt − Y j (s))Yi (s),

s=1

where wh (y jt −Y j (s)) = (Sh)−1 k ((y jt − Y j (s))/(Sh)) and k(·) denotes the kernel weights. To choose the smoothing parameter
h, cross-validation methods proposed in the literature for nonparametric regression can be used (for details see, e.g., Ref.8 ).
If one is interested in the relation between regression slopes and correlation coefficients, a time varying relationship
between variables can be assumed mi (Y j (t)) = βi (t)Y j (t) (see Ref.7 ) leading to a semiparametric regression model. In
such case, the time varying correlation between two variables, ρi j (t), is related to the time varying slope βi (t) as ρi j (t) =
βi (t) (σi (t))−1 σ j (t), where σi2 (t) and σ 2j (t) are the time varying variances of variables Yi and Y j that can be estimated by
smoothing the corresponding squared residuals. Then, ρ̂i j (t) can be estimated through the time varying slope defined as
S

β̂i (t) =

∑ wh,tsY j (s)2

s=1

!−1

S

∑ wh,tsYi (s)Y j (s)

s=1

In this setting, the estimation of Yi (t) is given by Ŷi (t) = m̂i (Y j (t)) = β̂i (t)Y j (t). This relation would allow to replace the
product of slopes of the regression models estimating the trend of the different pairs of stocks in a triad by the product of
their respective conditional correlation and replace the study of predictability in stock markets by that of balance in WSSNs.
Nevertheless, linear correlation is not appropriate for financial variables as we have mentioned before. Hence, we consider
the rank correlation as the connectivity measure between nodes in the network. Note that if the variables were gaussian, there
is a one-to-one relationship between the linear correlation and Kendall’s tau, i.e., ρi j (t) = sin((π /2)τi j (t)), so using Kendall’s
tau generalizes the analysis made with linear correlation.

C. Balance
The definition of balance given in the main text is:

K=

tr (exp (βrel A (G)))
,
tr (exp(βrel A (G′ )))

which has also been defined in9 .
Let us first express the exponential of the adjacency matrix of the WSSN as a Taylor series (see for instance Ref.10 ):
2
 β3

βrel
tr A2 (G) + rel tr A3 (G) + · · · .
2!
3!

Notice that tr (I) = n and tr (A (G)) = 0. The term tr Ak (G) represents the sum of all closed walks of length k in
the WSSN. A walk of length k between the nodes v and u in an WSSN is the product of the Kendall’s tau
 for all (not
necessarily different) edges in the sequence ev,1 , e1,2 , . . . ek−1,u . The walk is closed if v = u. Then, tr A2 (G) = ∑(i, j)∈E τi2j

and tr A3 (G) = ∑(i, j,k)∈△ τi j τik τ jk , where △ is the triangle with vertices i, j, k. We can continue with higher order powers
of A (G), which are related to squares, pentagons, and so forth, apart
from other cyclic and non-cyclic subgraphs. Obviously,

we have already shown here that for a signed triangle tr A3 (G) = 6K̃, where K̃ = τi j τik τ jk was defined in the main text of
the paper as an index of predictability of the stock trends in a triad.
Let us first prove that K = 1 if and only if the WSSN is balanced. For that we first state a result proved by Acharya11.

tr (exp (βrel A (G))) = n +

Theorem 1. For any signed graph, the matrices A (G) and A (G′ ) are isospectral if and only if the signed graph is balanced.
2

This means that both matrices A (G) and A (G′ ) have exactly the same eigenvalues λ j (A (G)) and λ j (A (G′ )), respectively,
if and only if the graph G is balanced. Then, we can write

K=

∑nj=1 eβrel λ j (A(G))
′

∑nj=1 eβrel λ j (A(G ))

,

which is equal to one if and only if the graph is balanced.
Let us now show that K quantifies the departure of a WSSN from balance for non-balanced ones. Let us designate
Wk = tr Ak (G) the total number of CWs of length k in the WSSN. Obviously, Wk = ∑ni=1 Wk (i), where Wk (i) is the number
of CW of length k that starts (and ends) at the node i. Then, Wk (i) < 0 if the node i is in an unbalanced cycle. Otherwise,
Wk (i) > 0. Therefore, Wk (G) = ∑i=1 Wk+ (i) − ∑i=1 Wk− (i) , where Wk+ (i)and Wk− (i) are positive and negative CWs of

We can see now that K = 1 only when the WSSN does not have any unbalanced cycle, i.e., W − (G) = 0. Also, K departs
2 |W − (G)|
from one as the number of unbalanced walks growth, K = 1 − +
, which approaches asymptotically to zero
W (G) + |W − (G)|
as 2 |W − (G)| → (W + (G) + |W − (G)|).

Materials
D. Data
We construct stock networks for some European countries, the US and Japan. The seven selected European countries are
Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Spain (those five known as GIIPS) plus Germany and France as core countries. The US and
Japan stock markets are considered as they belong to the main drivers of the world economy. The data set contains equities’
daily closing price and volume data from 01-03-2005 to 09-15-2020, obtained from the Morningstar database. This data set
is available from the authors on reasonable request.
The criteria used to consider a company as a candidate to form the database for each country is the trading volume at
the end of April 2020. Initially a set of around 250 companies with the highest trading volume at the 28th of April 2020 is
considered, except for the US and Japan for which the initial sets are extended to 794 and 427 companies respectively because
their stock markets are very diversified in terms of volume. Then, companies with a big amount of missing values (more
than three market years of consecutive missing values or more than 30 % of non-consecutive missing values) according to
the daily closing prices series have dropped out. There are many possible reasons for those missing values, such as trading
cancellation for a period of time, stock market exit, late entry into the stock market, merger of companies, bankruptcy, etc.
We find that allowing for the 30% of missing values in a stock price series is a reasonable threshold. Nevertheless there are
some exceptions, companies with more than 30% of missings but with a leading trading volume such as Abengoa S.A Class
B (ABG.P) from the Spanish stock market, which constitutes the 39% of the total trading volume on the reference date, are
excluded from this screening.
After the cleaning process, the database is composed by a set of representative companies according to the sector to which
they belong (under Russell Global Sector classification) and their trading volume.

As the inverse temperature β of the networks we use monthly EPU index data12 for each country from January 2005
to September 2020. Portugal is an exception since there is no specific EPU index available for it. Therefore, the European EPU index is considered instead. EPU index data is publicly available in the Economic Policy Uncertainty website
(https://www.policyuncertainty.com/index.html).

E. Events that may have triggered BUTs
In the paper we have observed a lack of capacity of national EPU indexes to explain the balance transition in those
countries that have experienced it. This might be due to the relationship between the US EPU index and foreign stock markets
being stronger than that between these stock markets and their corresponding national EPU indexes. While there are some
contradictory results depending on the chosen methodology13, a large amount of evidence shows an association between the
EPU index and greater stock price volatility for the US12, 14–17 , with this association being particularly strong during very
high uncertainty episodes18. However, the evidence for the relationship between national or European EPU indexes and stock
market volatility for other countries is generally weaker19, state dependent20 and shows important levels of heterogeneity13, 21 .
Indeed, Mei et al.22 find that models including the US EPU index can achieve better forecasting performance for European
stock markets volatility, while the inclusion of the corresponding national own EPU index does not significantly increase
forecasts accuracy. In this same direction, Ko and Lee20 show that the negative link between the national EPU and stock
prices changes over time, being importantly influenced by the co-movement of the national EPU index and the US one.
In the period considered in our study, the US EPU index attains its highest level before the COVID-19 crisis in August
2011, coinciding with the Black Monday. The Black Monday 2011 refers to August 8, when the US and global stock market
crashed, following the credit rating downgrade by Standard and Poor’s of the US sovereign debt from AAA for the first time
in history. This same period coincides with extremely high values for the US, European and Asian stock market volatility
indexes, VIX, VSTOXX and VKOSPI respectively. These indexes - with an important leading role of the VIX on the other
two through strong spillover effects- are established measures of fear, risk and uncertainty in international stock markets,
proved to be important in explaining stock returns23. The three of them attained their highest point between the 2008 financial
crisis and the current COVID-19 crisis in September 2011, coinciding with the balance transition found in national stock
markets.
These findings point towards the events associated to the Black Monday 2011 as the most likely triggers for the balance
transition we observe in five of the countries in our sample. The association between a period of increased -economic policyuncertainty and a sudden loss of balance seems coherent with the reduction of balance observed for most of the countries also
after the crisis produced by COVID-19. However, this line of reasoning conflicts with the lack of a generalized, strong-enough
drop in balance during the financial crisis of 2007-2008 in most of the countries. The US stock market did suffer significant
balance fluctuations in this period, even if these were different from a strict loss of balance since balance was recovering after
falling. A potential explanation might be the interruption of the negative time-varying correlation between policy uncertainty
and stock market returns that took place during the financial crisis. This could be a consequence of the unprecedented bailout
package for the US banking sector of 2008 and the stimulus package of 2009, which pushed the market into positive returns
even if the policy uncertainty remained high14 .
A detailed exploration of the causes of the heterogeneous behavior of the different countries is out of the scope of this
paper. Italy, Japan and Germany, the three countries without a balance transition during the period had lower long-term GDP
growth before the 2007-2008 financial crisis, but the obvious commonalities finish there. A promising avenue for the further
exploration of this question might consider the differential impact of the European debt crisis in each country: the ranking
of the countries according to the long-term interest rates of their national debt during this period matches the intensity of the
observed balance transitions, with the exception of Italy and France.

F. Quasi-CSG-WSSN
Here we define quasi-CSG-WSSN which are used in the main text of the manuscript. Let n, m− and m+ be the number
of nodes, of negative and positive edges in a real WSSN, respectively. We create a CSG with a clique of s < n nodes and
1
1
s (2n − s − 1) < m− edges. We complete the quasi-CSG-WSSN by adding randomly and independently m− − s (2n − s − 1)
2
2
negative and m+ positive edges among the nodes not in the clique. Additionally, we create the random-WSSN by adding
randomly and independently m− and m+ edges among n nodes a la Erdős-Rényi24. A Matlab code for building such graphs is
given in Algorithm 1.
In Figure S1 we illustrate an example of quasi-CSG-WSSN with n = 50, m− = 500, m+ = 100, and s = 10.
We then tested the following two hypothesis:
1. Unbalanced WSSNs depend only on n, m− and m+ and not on any specific structure.
2. Unbalanced WSSNs depend on the existence of specific quasi-CSG structure.

Figure S1. Illustration of a quasi-CSG-WSSN with n = 50, m− = 500, m+ = 100, and s = 10.
In the first case, the real-world WSSN would be more “similar” to its random version than to the quasi-CSG-WSSN and in
the second case it would be more similar to the quasi-CSG-WSSN. For the “similarity” between the different networks we
focus here on the spectrum of their adjacency matrices. The reason for that is that the eigenvalues of this matrix determine the
balance of the network as we have seen from its definion before. For determining the value of s we explore all possible values
and find the root mean square error (RMSE) between the spectrum of the real WSSN and that of the quasi-CSG-WSSN. The
smallest RMSE, sopt , determines the “best” value of s.

Table S1. Analysis of WSSNs with BUT. The number of companies s forming a central negative clique for each WSSN as
well as the acronym for each company in such clique. The last three columns correspond to the analysis of the simulations of
WSSNs with random and with quasi-CSG structures, where sopt is the optimal value of s to minimize the root mean square
error (RMSE) in the spectrum of the adjacency matrix of the quasi-CSG network relative to the real one. Underlined stocks
correspond to the financial sector.
