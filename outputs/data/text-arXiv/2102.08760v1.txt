Abstract. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the potential and feasibility of back-support exoskeletons to help the caregivers in the Intensive
Care Unit (ICU) of the University Hospital of Nancy (France) executing Prone Positioning (PP) maneuvers on patients suffering from severe
COVID-19-related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. After comparing four commercial exoskeletons, the Laevo passive exoskeleton was
selected and used in the ICU in April 2020. The first volunteers using the Laevo reported very positive feedback and reduction of effort, confirmed
by EMG and ECG analysis. Laevo has been since used to physically assist during PP in the ICU of the Hospital of Nancy, following the
recrudescence of COVID-19, with an overall positive feedback.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed healthcare systems worldwide as never before, with significant consequences for clinical
management, including rationing of care, and facing a limitation of capacity and resources of Intensive Care Units (ICU) to safely
maintain a high number of patients on mechanical ventilation during the surge. Prone positioning (PP), i.e. when a patient is
repositioned from a supine position (i.e., lying on his/her back) to lie on a prone position (i.e., on his/her front side), is known to
improve oxygenation and ventilatory mechanics in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) patients who require mechanical
ventilatory support [1]. PP is therefore largely used during the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, in the Hospital of Nancy, the
ICU performed 116 PP maneuvers in the first 10 days of the outbreak, which is equivalent to the number of maneuvers they usually
perform in a whole year. Although turning a patient into the prone position is not an invasive procedure, it is complex and has

2

many potential complications requiring adequate and well-trained healthcare staff (Fig. 1). It is also an exhausting and very timeconsuming task. Namely, PP procedure requires the medical staff to remain with their torso bent forward for several minutes, thus
causing load and potential injuries in the low back [2]. In addition, obesity-related complications have been identified as risk factors
of severe COVID-19 [3], and patients weighting up to 150kg are common in ICUs. Obesity makes it even more difficult and
physically demanding for caregivers to manipulate the patient’s body when he/she is curarized.

Fig. 1. The PP maneuver executed on a patient simulator (a manikin) at the Simulation Center of the University Hospital of Nancy (France).
Although small differences in the practice of PP can happen from one hospital to another, the maneuver is substantially standardized (video
tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-qyeN3e8iU). A: A doctor positioned behind the head of the patient secure the head to avoid
extubation and coordinate the whole procedure. Four teammates are distributed on both sides of the patient to reposition and turn the patient. B:
The 4 teammates lift the patient and position him/her on one side of the bed. C: The 2 teammates on the right place a clean bed linen. D: The 2
teammates on the left pivot the patient temporarily on the side using the old linen. E: The patient is rotated toward vent until in prone position,
lying on his/her abdomen. F: The 4 teammates lift the patient to position him/her at the center of the bed and add pillow underneath him/her.

Musculoskeletal injuries and back pain generated by the repetition of strenuous tasks are well-known in industrial scenarios [2],
and many back-support systems have been proposed to alleviate the problem. Given the similarity of the postures, robotics
assistance used in industry might also be useful to assist caregivers. In the specific case of PP maneuver, collaborative robots or
mobile manipulators are not suitable, mainly due to limited robot payload and lack of available space in the ICU. Motorized beds
that can help with manual repositioning of patients (e.g., Hospidex toto with inflatable air cells and Vendlet V5S with motorized
bars) do exist, but they cannot fully replace the work of the caregivers and require substantial time and financial resources to be
put in place. Conversely, occupational exoskeletons [4] appear as less invasive for the current practice, easy to set up, cheap, and
compatible with the caregivers’ work in the ICU.
Exoskeletons are wearable devices generally aimed at supporting physical tasks by generating appropriate force on one or multiple
human joints. Recently, there has been increasing interest in employing exoskeletons for workplace ergonomics, to reduce physical
workload [4] and risks of developing musculoskeletal disorders [5]. Exoskeletons can be active (motorized) or passive, in which
case mechanical elements such as springs store and restore energy, transferring the load from one body part to another. Previous
studies generally agree on the efficiency of passive back-support exoskeletons (designed to assist with the back and hip muscles)
to reduce lumbar muscular activity and perceived exertion/discomfort, particularly during operations involving trunk
flexion/extension in the sagittal plane [5].
However, the magnitudes of the reduction observed in back muscle activity when using those systems differ substantially from
one study to another [6,7,8,9], likely because of considerable disparities in protocols (e.g. populations, tasks, postures, exoskeleton
designs). This results in confusion regarding the magnitude of assistance to be expected when using a back-support exoskeleton.
Besides, while occupational exoskeletons are deployed in the industrial sector [4], there are very few reports of their use in the

Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics 2021 - International Conference

healthcare system and no reported use in an ICU. Two active back-support exoskeletons (respectively the HAL for Care Support
[10] and a custom prototype [11]) were tested in a simulated sit-to-stand patient transfer task, but the movements and postures
involved differ strongly from those observed during PP maneuvers. The use of exoskeletons in the healthcare domain was also
investigated in [12] to assist surgeons, but only focused on shoulder assistance.
Given the task-specific efficiency and functionality of exoskeletons [6], a multidisciplinary team of medical doctors, robotics
researchers and ergonomists conducted a pilot study to evaluate the potential and feasibility of using occupational back-support
exoskeletons to help caregivers in ICU during PP maneuvers. In this paper, we report on our pilot study that enabled to use the
Laevo passive exoskeleton (Laevo, Ryswick, the Netherlands) in the ICU of the University Hospital of Nancy. The study was
conducted in two steps. Initially, in a simulated environment, to probe into the helpfulness of an exoskeleton during PP. Then, in
the real ICU to demonstrate the feasibility of using an exoskeleton during a COVID-19 PP shift. In this paper, we present an
extended version of the preliminary work we presented in [13] accounting for feedback of use of the device from April 2020 to
January 2021. Specifically, we report the experimental procedure and all the materials that we designed ad-hoc for this study, to
make it fully reproducible by other robotics and medical teams. We report the entire questionnaires and further detail about the
materials and methods in the Supplementary Material at the end of the article.

Exploratory Study to Select the Most Suitable Exoskeleton at the Hospital Simulation Center

Preliminary visual video analysis of PP maneuvers revealed that the medical staff can assume postures with forward trunk bending
up to 45 degrees with raised arms straight forward, exert traction to the trunk bending up to 20-30 degrees, and hold prolonged
static postures with the trunk bent forward up to 60 degrees. To confirm the visual observation, we recorded the whole-body
kinematics of one physician (M, 35 years old, 175cm) performing the PP maneuver, using the Xsens MVN inertial motion capture
system (Xsens, Enschede, the Netherlands, capture rate: 240Hz). Postural analysis with the AnyBody biomechanical simulation
software (AnyBody Technology, Aalborg, Denmark) revealed that when operating at the side of the patient, the physician spends
approximately 40% of the maneuver time with the torso bent more than 20 degrees forward; when operating behind the head of
the patient to secure the head and avoid extubation, the physician maintains a static posture with important flexion of the trunk for
several minutes. The precise angle of flexion, in this case, depends on the height of the patient’s bed, his/her location relative to
the bed, and the doctor’s height. Even when not associated with load manipulation, such postures cause mechanical load in the
lower back [2]. For such postures, exoskeletons for lumbar support can help, but to be used in ICU they have to match many
usability constraints, such as being lightweight and unburdensome. Based on this analysis, and with the urgency of the situation in
mind, we identified four commercial exoskeletons that were already available in our teams and that could meet the requirements:
Corfor (Corfor, France), Laevo v1 (Laevo, Netherlands), BackX (SuitX, USA), and CrayX (German Bionics, Germany). Corfor is
a passive soft exoskeleton (also known as exosuit), Laevo and BackX are passive rigid exoskeletons based on springs, while CrayX
is an active exoskeleton, employing electrical actuators.
Methods - Five experienced PPT volunteers performed 11 PP maneuvers, consisting of Prone to Supine (PS) and Supine to Prone
(SP) gestures, with a 100kg manikin. All participants filled a questionnaire to retrieve human factors (Questionnaire A,
Supplementary Materials). Two of the participants (M, 30 and 35 years old) alternatively tried all 4 exoskeletons at the manikin’s
side. After testing each exoskeleton, these 2 subjects answered an evaluation and acceptance questionnaire (Questionnaire B,
Supplementary Material) adapted from [14], consisting of 19 items on a 5-point Likert scale with a neutral option, to evaluate the
perceived effort, safety, comfort, efficacy, installation, intention to use. They also reported on their perceived efforts using an effort
evaluation questionnaire (Questionnaire C, Supplementary Material) and on their experience in a semi-directed interview
conducted by one experimenter. To analyze the kinematics and dynamics of the maneuver, we replayed the participant’s wholebody motion recorded with the Xsens motion capture system with a Digital Human Model (DHM) using the Dart physics engine.
The DHM has 43 degrees of freedom and it is scaled based on the participant’s height and mass using average anthropometric
coefficients. We used a hierarchical velocity quadratic programming (QP) controller based on the OpenSoT library [15] to retarget
the participant’s upper-body motion directly in the Cartesian space (the lower-body was mainly fixed during the PP maneuvers).
In the absence of physiological measures, we used the DHM computed joint torques as a surrogate measure of the efforts
performed by the participants during the experiment to investigate the effect of the exoskeleton. We used the DHM L5/S1
flexion/extension joint torques estimated with the dynamic simulation to compare the lumbar effort exerted by the participant with
and without the exoskeleton. When no exoskeleton is worn, the joint torque exerted by the human is directly retrieved from the
simulation. However, when the participant is equipped with the exoskeleton, the net torque exerted at the L5/S1 joint to counter
the dynamics and gravity effects on the upper-body is a sum of the human-generated torque and of the exoskeleton assistive torque:
𝜏"#$% = 𝜏'()*+ +𝜏,-. . The net torque is retrieved from the DHM simulation, but in order to estimate the human torque, the assistive
torque 𝜏,-. provided by each exoskeleton is needed. To compute this torque, one needs the details about the mechatronics design
of the platform. Since the Laevo was unanimously perceived as the most suitable exoskeleton to help in PP maneuvers, we
computed 𝜏,-. for the Laevo only, using the Laevo empirical calibration curve published by Koopman et al. in [9] and the
maximum torque (40 Nm) reported in the Laevo user manual. The dynamics analysis was performed with a simplified simulation,
which has limitations. The effects of the Laevo weight (~2.5kg) and of external loads were ignored in the torque estimation. That

Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics 2021 - International Conference

4

is, we ignored the efforts associated with manipulating the manikin, and only focused on the postural efforts. This simplification
matters only at the lateral position, since the external load at the head position was only associated with maintaining the
endotracheal tube, and was not significant.
Results - In comparison with the non-assisted situation, both participants perceived a reduction of physical effort for all
exoskeletons except the CORFOR. Table 1 reports the questionnaire’s scores (mean±stdev) for each construct. All the exoskeletons
scored positively in terms of perceived safety and comfort, and the participants did not notice a change in their performance,
positive or negative, while using the exoskeleton. Laevo was the easiest to install and had the highest and only positive score in
the intention to use. Both participants reported that CrayX was too cumbersome to wear in an ICU, while the mechanical design
of BackX was unpleasantly hindering several arm movements of the PP maneuver. Both were restricting the range of motion for
some gestures. CORFOR was not helpful. Conversely, they were satisfied with Laevo in terms of perceived assistance during bent
postures, easiness of equipment, and freedom of movements. Importantly, they mentioned that Laevo was not modifying their
movements during the PP maneuver, which was confirmed by the analysis of the kinematic data [13].

Kinematic analysis - We first verified whether the motion of the L5/S1 joint in the sagittal plane (low-back flexion/extension
motion) was affected by the use of any of the 4 exoskeletons. We manually segmented each trial into 2 segments: Prone to Supine
(PS) and Supine to Prone (SP) positioning. We compared the low-back flexion angle for the PS and SP, for all 4 exoskeletons and
without exoskeleton: the joint angle profiles are overall similar for all conditions; their minimum and maximum values are similar
(typical profiles in Supplementary Material). The median value of the back-flexion angle of the participant across one trial did not
vary significantly from one condition to another (Fig. 3). Minor variations from one condition to another can be explained by small
differences in the manikin’s position on the bed and the overall maneuver performed by the team. These results suggest that the
range of motion of the L5/S1 flexion/extension joint during the PP maneuver was not affected by the use of any of the exoskeletons.
Dynamic analysis - We estimated the human L5/S1 flexion torque during the PP maneuver, both with and without the Laevo (Fig.
4). When using Laevo for the SP and PS maneuvers, the low back torque medians were reduced by 11.3% and 13.0% respectively.
Those results, though limited to one participant, suggest that wearing the Laevo may reduce the human low-back torque during PP
maneuvers, which agrees with the subjective report of the participants. This result also agrees with the 15% reduction of the L5/S1
moment observed in [9] for a similar static forward bending task.

Quantification of the LAEVO’s assistance at the hospital simulation center

To complement the preliminary results described in the previous section, we performed a subsequent experiment to probe into
the physiological effects of the Laevo during PP maneuvers. For sanitary reasons, this experiment was also conducted at the
Hospital Simulation Center.
Methods - The same 2 volunteers were equipped with an ECG sensor (Delsys Trigno ECG Biofeedback, 2 channels, bandwidth:
30Hz, sampling rate 4370 sa/sec with onboard Butterworth bandpass filter 40/80 dB/Dec) and 12 surface EMG sensors (Delsys
Trigno, EMG sampling rate 4370 sa/sec). Surface electrodes were positioned on the skin according to Seniam protocol
recommendations after abrasion and cleaning with alcohol. The muscle activity was recorded bilaterally in erector spinae
longissimus (ESL), erector spinae iliocostalis (ESI), trapezius ascendens (TA), biceps femoris long head (BF); and laterally on the
right side for rectus abdominis at T10 level (RA), rectus femoris (RF), gluteus maximus (GM) and tibialis anterior (TAL). The
participants performed the PP maneuver without and with the Laevo exoskeleton, positioned successively at the head and at the
side of the manikin. The physiological signals were also recorded during a control condition, where the subject was standing still
and silent. For all the conditions, we recorded a single repetition lasting 4 minutes.
Results - Heart rate: The instantaneous heart rate was computed offline by the Delsys EMGWorks software with its proprietary
Template Matching method. Fig. 6 compares the instantaneous heart rate across conditions for the first participant. Table 2
summarizes the median heart rate value for both participants. Overall, we did not observe any significant change in the heart rate
when using the exoskeleton. For participant 1, we observed a slight decrease in the median heart rate value in both positions (head:
-3.66%; side: -6.07%), whereas for participant 2 the median heart rate either increased (head: +4.85%) or decreased (side: -6.61%).
It must be noted that both participants are confirmed athletes, which explains their low basal heart rates. The weak differences in
heart rate do not indicate a particular physiological gain when using the Laevo for such short tasks (4 minutes). For longer tasks
and/or more repetitions of PP maneuvers results may differ, and a more thorough evaluation is needed to confirm.

resting condition and while executing the PP maneuver at the head and at the side of the simulated patient.

EMG: The raw EMG signal was rectified and filtered through an RMS filter with a 100ms window, then by a 4th order Butterworth
low pass filter with a 10Hz cut-off frequency. Table 3 displays the change in the RMS value of the EMG signal when using the
Laevo, compared to the baseline with no exoskeleton. We observed a general decrease of the activity of the back-extensor muscles
(except ESI which was not affected and the head condition for P2) and the hip extensor muscles, when using the Laevo, probably
depending on the task, the position in the team and the individual characteristics. Conversely, the activity of the antagonist trunk
and leg muscles and of the lower-leg muscles remained similar when using the Laevo. Although our results are strongly limited
by the small number of participants and the absence of repetitions of the task, they suggest a promising physiological gain brought
by the Laevo. This gain is coherent with the subjective evaluation retrieved in the questionnaires, and endorsed the use in the ICU.
Furthermore, those results are in line with the changes in muscle activity observed in other studies where the Laevo was tested in
similar static forward bending tasks [9,16].

Implementation in Real-life Conditions in the ICU of the University Hospital of Nancy

Building upon these promising pilot results, and given the urgency associated with the COVID-19 crisis, we proceeded to test in
realistic conditions to demonstrate the feasibility of using Laevo in a COVID-19 ICU situation.
Methods - The same 2 participants were each equipped with a Laevo complying with the drastic hygiene rules of the ICU during
the outbreak. Each participant wore the Laevo over a single-use scrub suit and underneath the personal protective equipment (long
sleeve gown) covering the entire body to reduce the risk of contamination. That way the exoskeleton was not in contact with the
patient nor with the contaminated environment. During a typical 3-hour shift, the participants performed 10 PP maneuvers on 10
ICU patients; each participant was positioned 3 times at the head and 7 times at the patient’s side, respectively. After each
maneuver, the participants reported their perceived effort using a Borg-CR10 scale (questionnaire D part 1, Supplementary
Material). Cardiac activity was monitored with a Holter-ECG during the whole shift in the ICU. At the end of the shift, they
reported on the use of the exoskeleton (questionnaire D part 2, Supplementary Material), then filled the extended version (22items) of the exoskeleton evaluation questionnaire (questionnaire B, Supplementary Material), and reported on their experience in
an interview. Concomitantly, the PPT colleagues filled a questionnaire to report on their experience working alongside people
equipped with exoskeletons (questionnaire E, Supplementary Material).
Results - Both physicians perceived a physical relief in the low back during bent postures, particularly when working at the
patient’s head, and indicated an intention to adopt such technology after the pilot study. ECG data analysis was inconclusive due
to the multiple biases in this real-life condition (e.g., elevated stress of the participants due to the COVID-19 context) and the
frequency of multiple gestures performed during the PP maneuver [17]. Overall, Laevo was positively evaluated in terms of
physical relief (questionnaire score: 4.2±0.4): both participants reported that the perceived general fatigue at the end of the shift
was reduced when using Laevo. Importantly they both said they would use Laevo again without hesitation for future shifts where
they would be positioned at the patient’s head (effort score on Borg-CR10 scale: head: 1.8±0.4; side: 3.2±0.7). The participants
found the Laevo comfortable (questionnaire score: 4.5±0.5), except when walking, which is a well-known issue of Laevo v1 [18]
that was improved in recent versions. Laevo did not prevent or constrain their usual gestures and activity in the ICU (Fig. 7).
Accordingly, their teammates did not notice any particular changes in the practice, and no physical or psychological side effects
were observed. Those results are important for a future adoption of Laevo in the current practice, because the positive attitude of
the co-workers is fundamental for the acceptance of new technology at work [19].

Use of the Exoskeleton in the ICU of the University Hospital of Nancy in the second wave of
pandemic

Two additional Laevo v2.5 were provided to the medical staff, for a total of 4 exoskeletons since October 2020 (two v1 and two
v2.5). At the present day (January 26, 2021) the 4 exoskeletons have been tested by more than 60 healthcare workers (medical
doctors and nurses). Preliminary feedback from the medical staff confirms that the exoskeletons are useful to reduce the physical
effort and back pain. Laevo v2.5 is preferred because of the walking feature (a lever enables to unblock the exoskeleton and walk
normally). The adoption of the devices has been variable: some physicians are regular users (i.e., they ask to use the exoskeleton
when they have to perform one or more PP), others are neutral or even sceptic.
The characteristics of the second wave of COVID-19, interestingly, have determined some differences in the use of the
exoskeletons. The number of daily PP maneuvers performed in the ICU has been highly variable but generally lower than the in
the first wave, sometimes even zero: so, the exoskeletons have not been used on a regular basis. The lower number of PP and the
staff rotations made it possible for physicians to significantly reduce the number of PP per day: so, the exoskeleton was really not
used as a personal equipment but shared among a pool of users and for few PP. While this could seem a positive point (it can help
a larger group of users), it introduced a fundamental problem which is the repetitive act to calibrate and fit the exoskeleton to each
person’s body at each use. This caused a major obstacle to the regular use: several users reported that they considered it “difficult
to adjust” and that the fitting took too much time. When physicians only have 1 PP to perform, for example, the benefit brought
by the exoskeleton is not worth the time and frustration they experience when they have to wear it and adjust it. Interestingly, this
problem is even bigger for Laevo v2.5, since the physicians must change the metallic bars corresponding to their size, an operation
that is considered also difficult.
Overall, while it is clear that the exoskeleton is helping the physicians, its use as a shared tool (and not as a personal equipment)
is preventing its adoption.

Conclusion

Our pilot study demonstrated that back-support exoskeletons are readily feasible to deploy in an ICU to physically assist the
medical staff engaged in PP maneuvers, even in the dreadful sanitary context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Despite the many limitations of our exploratory study, carried out rapidly due to the urgency of the situation and with limited
availability of physicians heavily busy in the hospital, we were able to demonstrate the feasibility and potential usefulness of using
a back-support exoskeleton to assist during PP maneuvers in the ICU in less than two weeks. Though only 2 physicians used the
passive exoskeleton Laevo during the PP maneuvers in the ICU in April 2020, they both perceived a physical relief in the low back
during bent postures, particularly when working at the patient’s head, and indicated an intention to adopt such technology after the
pilot study. EMG and ECG analysis in the lab study confirm the help of the device. Four Laevo exoskeletons have been used in
the ICU of the Hospital of Nancy since October 2020: tested by more than 60 people, they have been used regularly only by a
small group of physicians. Their adoption is currently mainly limited by the use as a shared tool, while they should be a personal
equipment. This is not surprising: it is known that the performance and physical assistance provided by an exoskeleton are not the
only criteria for its adoption, and other factors, individual or organizational, are also critical [14]. Nevertheless, the positive
feedback from the regular users of the exoskeleton is very encouraging: we are currently evaluating the use of the exoskeletons in

Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics 2021 - International Conference

8

the ICU as a personal equipment with a small group of volunteers.
The future adoption of this technology in the current practice will require more thorough studies quantifying the physiological
benefits for a larger participant group size, with more repetitions of the maneuver to match the real use of the exoskeleton over an
entire work shift, and evaluating the effects in a longitudinal study.
By reporting the experimental protocol and all the materials, we encourage other teams to replicate our study, help the medical
staff of other hospitals, and to share feedback on experience among interested worldwide intensive care units.

Supplementary Material
I. QUESTIONNAIRES
In this supplementary material, we report the entire set of questionnaires that we used during our study, to facilitate
reproducibility and replication of our results by other teams.
A. Human factors related to prone positioning
This questionnaire must be filled by any participants to the prone positioning (PP) study before doing any PP maneuver in
simulation or in the ICU. It is necessary to retrieve relevant information such as experience with the PP in the hospital before and
during the COVID-19 pandemic, history of back pain that is medically relevant for the study, attitude towards the exoskeleton
technology. A semi-directed interview to gain a deeper knowledge of the expectations of the participants is complementary: the
experimenter can ask, for example, if the participants have already seen or used an exoskeleton, a robot or a prosthetic device, and
get insights into their past experience.

B. Acceptance evaluation of an exoskeleton for prone positioning
This questionnaire is an extract from a larger questionnaire1 that was developed by INRS to investigate the acceptance of
exoskeletons introduced in an industrial context. Some questions have been adapted to our specific use case.
This questionnaire must be filled by the physicians equipped with the exoskeleton to receive physical assistance during the
prone positioning maneuver. It is used to evaluate the exoskeletons in the simulated study and in the real-life conditions. Questions
marked with an asterisk are to be filled only after using the exoskeleton in real-life condition, i.e., in the ICU. Reverse questions
are marked with R.

C. Evaluating the overall effort of a prone positioning maneuver with/without an exoskeleton
This questionnaire must be filled after realizing a prone positioning (PP) maneuver with or without an exoskeleton. It provides
a subjective evaluation of the amount of physical effort and discomfort perceived while executing the PP. It provides a surrogate
measure of standardized quantitative measures of efforts, such as surface EMGs placed over muscles of interests, whenever
obtaining such measures is not possible. For example, using surface EMGs in the ICU was not possible for sanitary reasons.

D. Questionnaire for physicians using the exoskeleton in the ICU
This questionnaire must be filled by the physicians equipped with the exoskeleton and using them in the ICU for PP maneuvers.
The first part must be filled at the end of each PP maneuver (i.e., if the physician performs 20 maneuvers, he/she will fill the sheet
20 times, one after each PP). The second part must be filled at the end of the work-shift, for example in the changing room of the
medical staff to avoid contamination. It must be noted that since the first batch of questionnaires are filled in the ICU following
each PP, the paper sheets are considered “potentially contaminated” and therefore should rest untouched in a safe place for 3-4
days before manually processing them by the experimenters, in order to reduce any risk of contamination by direct skin contact.

II. EXOSKELETONS USED IN THE EXPLORATORY STUDY
Four commercial exoskeletons were used in the exploratory study at the Hospital Simulation Center: Corfor (Corfor, France),
Laevo v1 (Laevo, Netherlands), BackX (SuitX, USA), and CrayX (German Bionics, Germany).
It must be noted that in this study we are not claiming a comprehensive comparison of the different exoskeletons that could have
been helpful. At the time of the study (which was during the 1st wave of the COVID-19 pandemic) it was not possible for us to
rapidly purchase more exoskeletons to evaluate, and it is possible that other passive or active exoskeletons for low-back support
which exist on the market could have been helpful for our task. Rather, we have an empirical proof of feasibility at least for one
exoskeleton: it can be used in the ICU to assist in Prone Positioning, it is well perceived and possibly beneficial.

Figure 2 - evaluation of the Corfor exosuit by the PP team. We assigned a Corfor system to each participant, choosing the size according to
their height and the recommendations of the manufacturer. Two participants are also equipped with the Xsens MVN suit to record their motion.
The device was reported as not helpful for the specific PP maneuver.

Figure 3 - evaluation of the Laevo exoskeleton by the PP team. We only had three Laevo v1, one for each size (small, medium, large). Each
exoskeleton was attributed to the participants according to their height and following the recommendations of the manufacturer. The Laevo
exoskeleton was immediately perceived helpful and intuitive. One participant reported a slight discomfort on the sternum during back flexion
and on the thighs during walking, noticing it would be better to unlock it to walk normally. This issue was solved in later versions of the Laevo
exoskeleton, such as the v2.5 that was purchased and used in the 2nd wave of the pandemic in the ICU (since October 2020).

Figure 4 - BackX worn by one participant. The arrows point to the metallic arcs that are constraining the arms during the PP gestures: the
participants pointed out that this was one of the main reasons for not choosing to use this exoskeleton for this particular gesture. The BackX
was perceived similar to the LAEVO in terms of assistance, but both participants reported that the metallic curved bars from the sternum to the
hip were preventing several arm movements necessary to complete the PP maneuver, and as such they felt they could not execute the entire
maneuver with this equipment in real conditions.

Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics 2021 - International Conference

19

Figure 5 - CrayX worn by two participants. The arrows highlight the external parts of the exoskeleton that add constraints to the workspace.
The CrayX was considered too cumbersome to be used around patients, and very difficult to tune. Both participants perceived it required
additional concentration effort during back flexion to enable the active support, which they couldn’t improve even after changing the sensitivity
parameter. Furthermore, one participant reported a critical discomfort due to a part of the CrayX applying a force on the dorsum.

III. ANALYSIS OF MOTION AND LUMBAR EFFORT WITH DIGITAL HUMAN MODEL
We replayed the participant’s whole-body motion recorded with the Xsens motion capture system with a 43 DoFs Digital Human
Model (DHM) using the Dart physics engine. The DHM consists of 19 rigid bodies linked together by 18 compound joints, for a
total of 43 DoFs (11 for the back and neck, 9 for each arm including the sternoclavicular joint, and 7 for each leg), plus 6 DoFs for
the free-floating base. Each DoF is a revolute joint controlled by a single actuator. The length of each segment of the DHM was
scaled to match the participant’s body segment length, while the DHM inertial parameters were scaled based on the participant’s
height and mass using average anthropometric coefficients.
To retarget the participant’s upper-body motion in the Cartesian space, we used a hierarchical quadratic programming (QP)
controller based on the OpenSoT library, which computes velocity commands to animate the DHM. The QP objective function
consisted of the following tasks and priorities:
• level 1 (top priority tasks): balance (center of mass) position task, feet position task (fixed);
• level 2: Cartesian trajectory tracking of the pelvis and thoracic spine segments (position and orientation), of the right and
left shoulder, elbow and wrist (position only), and of the head orientation;
where the reference trajectories for the tracking tasks were the 3D positions and orientations of the Xsens avatar’s body
segments.
After retargeting the participant’s upper-body motion, we used the DHM L5/S1 flexion/extension joint torques estimated with
the dynamic simulation to compare the lumbar effort exerted by the participant with and without the exoskeleton. The pipeline for
this processing is represented in the following Figure.

Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics 2021 - International Conference

20

Figure 6- In the study conducted at the Hospital Simulation Center, the motion of one physician executing the PP maneuver was captured with
the Xsens MVN suit (Step 1). We used the whole-body kinematic estimation of the Xsens MVN software (Step 2) as an input to our dynamic
simulation with a Digital Human Model (Step 3). The analysis of motion and estimation of human lumbar effort are based on this dynamic
simulation.

IV. KINEMATIC ANALYSIS
We analyzed the motion of the L5/S1 joint in the sagittal plane during the use of the four exoskeletons in the Prone to Supine
(PS) and Supine to Prone (SP) positioning. The following figure displays typical profiles of low-back flexion angle of one
participant, for the PS and SP, for all four exoskeletons and without exoskeleton. The joint angle profiles are overall similar for all
conditions; variations from one condition to another can be explained by small differences in the manikin’s position on the bed
and intrinsic variability in the entire maneuver performed by the team.

Figure 7- Lumbar spine flexion angle of one participant performing the PP maneuvers at the Hospital Simulation Center.

Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics 2021 - International Conference

V. DYNAMIC ANALYSIS
We estimated the human L5/S1 joint torque during the Prone to Supine (PS) and Supine to Prone (SP) positioning, with and
without the Laevo exoskeleton, using our DHM simulation.
When the participant is equipped with the exoskeleton, the net torque exerted at the L5/S1 joint to counter the dynamics and
gravity effects on the upper-body is a sum of the human-generated torque and of the exoskeleton assistive torque:
𝜏"#$% = 𝜏'()*+ +𝜏,-. . In order to estimate the human torque, the assistive torque 𝜏,-. provided by each exoskeleton is needed. To
compute this torque, one needs the details about the mechatronics design of the platform.
We performed this computation only for the Laevo exoskeleton, since it was the one unanimously perceived by the participants
as the most suitable candidate for use during PP maneuvers. Based on the Laevo empirical calibration curve published by Koopman
et al. and on the Laevo user manual which specifies that its set of springs provides a maximum torque of 40 Nm, we used the
following model to estimate 𝜏/*,0. :
´
𝑘3 + 𝑘% 𝜃
𝜏/*,0. = 1
,𝜃 > 0
𝑘3 + 𝑘% 𝜃 − 𝑘/.77 𝜃´ < 0
D)
where 𝜃 is the back flexion angle, 𝑘3 = −80⁄3𝑁𝑚 and 𝑘% = 4⁄3
are constants that encode the spring linearity in its range
E,F

of operation from 20 to 50 degrees (with the maximum assistance of 40 Nm at 50 degrees), and 𝑘/.77 = 10𝑁𝑚 represents frictional
losses which introduce hysteresis in the system (numerical values of the model’s coefficients were set so that the model matches
the calibration curve in [9] as closely as possible).
The following figure displays the estimated joint torque and lumbar flexion angle across time for one PP trial for one participant.

Figure 8 – Estimation of the human lumbar flexion torque and lumbar flexion angle of one participant performing the PP maneuvers at the
Hospital Simulation Center. The torques are estimated with the DHM simulation. The plot reports one PP trial across time.

VI. EMG AND ECG PLACEMENT
To study the quantification of the Laevo’s assistance, we recorded physiological measures on the participants executing PP
maneuvers with and without the Laevo exoskeleton. The participants were equipped with an ECG sensor (Delsys Trigno ECG
Biofeedback, 2 channels, bandwidth: 30Hz, ECG sampling rate 4370 sa/sec with onboard Butterworth bandpass filter 40/80
dB/Dec) and 12 surface EMG sensors (Delsys Trigno, EMG sampling rate 4370 sa/sec). The following figure shows the sensors
placement on the participant’s body, which was done according to Seniam protocol recommendations after abrasion and cleaning
with alcohol.
