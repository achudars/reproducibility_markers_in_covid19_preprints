Abstract
Predicting interactions among heterogenous
graph structured data has numerous applications
such as knowledge graph completion, recommendation systems and drug discovery. Often
times, the links to be predicted belong to rare
types such as the case in repurposing drugs for
novel diseases. This motivates the task of fewshot link prediction. Typically, GCNs are illequipped in learning such rare link types since
the relation embedding is not learned in an inductive fashion. This paper proposes an inductive RGCN for learning informative relation embeddings even in the few-shot learning regime.
The proposed inductive model significantly outperforms the RGCN and state-of-the-art KGE
models in few-shot learning tasks. Furthermore,
we apply our method on the drug-repurposing
knowledge graph (DRKG) for discovering drugs
for Covid-19. We pose the drug discovery task
as link prediction and learn embeddings for the
biological entities that partake in the DRKG. Our
initial results corroborate that several drugs used
in clinical trials were identified as possible drug
candidates. The method in this paper are implemented using the efficient deep graph learning
(DGL) (Wang et al., 2019).

1. Introduction
The timeline of the Covid-19 pandemic showcases the dire
need for fast development of effective treatments for new
diseases. Drug-repurposing is a drug discovery strategy
from existing drugs that significantly shortens the time
and reduces the cost compared to de novo drug discovery (Sertkaya et al., 2014; Avorn et al., 2015; Setoain et al.,
2015). Drug-repurposing leverages the fact that common

molecular pathways contribute to different diseases and
hence some drugs may be reused (Ashburn & Thor, 2004).
Drug-repurposing relies on identifying novel interactions
among biological entities like genes and compounds and
can be posed as a link prediction task over a biological network. Several machine learning approaches have been developed for addressing the drug-repurposingtask for Covid19; see e.g. (Gramatica et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2020;
Udrescu et al., 2016; Ioannidis et al., 2020). Towards assisting such machine learning techniques (Ioannidis et al.,
2020) created a comprehensive biological knowledge graph
relating genes, compounds, diseases, biological processes,
side effects and symptoms termed Drug Repurposing
Knowledge Graph (DRKG).
However, for novel diseases like Covid-19 only a few interactions are available among viral proteins and possible
chemical compounds that may inhibit the related genes.
This motivates the framework of few-shot link prediction,
where a certain edge type is rare and the model is called to
make predictions on the particular edge type.
1.1. Related works
Link prediction has been addressed by several works in the
context of knowledge-graph (KG) completion. These models rely on embedding the nodes and edges of the KG to
a vector space and then train by maximizing the score for
existing edges in the KGs; see e.g., (Wang et al., 2017a).
An efficient implementation of these models in DGL is presented in (Zheng et al., 2020). Nevertheless, these KGE
models do not naturally generalize in the few-shot scenario,
where only a few edges are available for a rare edge type,
which challenges learning the relation embedding. This
was addressed in (Chen et al., 2019), where a meta-learning
model is proposed to learn the relation embeddings in an
inductive fashion. However, this inductive-relation KGE
model require a specialized training scheme, can not learn
inductive node embeddings, and can not incorporate node
features if available.
Graph convolutional networks learn embeddings for nodes
and edges in the graph by applying a sequence of nonlinear operations parametrized by the graph adjacency matrix

Few-shot link prediction via graph neural networks

and utilize node and edge features (Kipf & Welling, 2017;
Schlichtkrull et al., 2018). An inductive implementation
of these models allows for learning node embeddings in
an inductive fashion (Hamilton et al., 2017). The RGCN
model (Schlichtkrull et al., 2018) has been successful in
link prediction, where the RGCN is supervised by KGE
models (Wang et al., 2017a). However, these GCN models
for link prediction inherit the limitation of the KGE models,
and are challenged in learning relation embeddings for rare
edges types.
1.2. Contributions
This paper addresses the aforementioned limitation of GCN
models by introducing a novel inductive-RGCN that learns
the relation and the node embeddings in an inductive fashion. The proposed I-RGCN naturally addresses the fewshot link prediction and outperforms competing state-ofthe-art models. I-RGCN is also tested in the DRKG for
Covid-19 drug-repurposing. The drug discovery task is naturally formulated in a few-shot learning setting. The preliminary results indicate that several drugs used in clinical
trials are discovered as possible drug candidates. While this
study, by no means recommends specific drugs, it demonstrates a powerful deep learning methodology to prioritize
existing drugs for further investigation, which holds the potential of accelerating therapeutic development for COVID19.

3. Learning inductive embedding for GNNs
The relational GCN (RGCN) (Schlichtkrull et al., 2018)
extends the graph convolution operation (Kipf & Welling,
2017) to heterogenous graphs. An RGCN model is comprised by a sequence of RGCN layers. The lth layer com(l+1)
putes the nth node representation hn
as follows


R
X
X (l)
h(l+1)
:= σ 
(1)
hn′ Wr(l) 
n
r=1 n′ ∈Nnr

where Nnr is the neighborhood of node n under relation r,
(l)
σ the rectified linear unit non linear function, and Wr is
a learnable matrix associated with the rth relation. Essentially, the output of the RGCN layer for node n is a nonlinear combination of the hidden representations of neighboring nodes weighted based on the relation type. The node
features are the input of the first layer in the model i.e.
(0)
hn = xn , where xn is the node feature for node n. For
node types without features we use an embedding layer that
takes as input an one-hot encoding of the node id.
The RGCN model in this paper is supervised by a DistMult
model (Yang et al., 2014) for link prediction. The loss function

2. Few-shot link prediction formulation
Consider the heterogeneous graph with T node types and
R relation types defined as G := {{Vt }Tt=1 , {Er }R
r=1 }. The
t
tth node type is defined as Vt := {vnt }N
and
may
repren=1
sent Genes or Chemical compounds in the DRKG. The rth
relation type holds all interactions of a certain type among
′
′
′
N t and N t Er := {(vnt , vnt ) ∈ N t × N t } and may represent that a chemical compound inhibits a gene or that a
disease is treated by a chemical compound.
Consider also that each node nt is associated with a
F × 1 feature vector xnt . This feature may represent
an embedding of the protein sequence associated with a
gene (Wang et al., 2017b). In KGs some node types may
not have features for these we use an embedding layer to
represent their features.
Few shot link prediction. Given R − 1 sets of edges
{Er }R−1
r=1 , a nodal attribute vector xnt per node nt , and a
small set of links in the few-shot relation ER with |ER | ≤
K, the few-shot link prediction amounts to inferring the
missing links of the rare type R. In the DRKG, this fewshot relation is for example coronavirus treatment.

where h⊤ denotes the transpose of a matrix, diag(r) denotes a diagonal matrix with r on its diagonal, hnt , hr ,
hnt′ are the embedding of the head entity nt , relation r
and the tail entity nt′ , respectively and D+ and D− are the
positive and negative sets of triplets and y = 1 if the triplet
corresponds to a positive example and −1 otherwise. The
scalar represented by h⊤ diag(hr )t denotes the score of
triplet (h, r, t) as given by the DistMult model (Yang et al.,
2014). The entity embeddings are obtained by the final layer of the RGCN. The relation type embedding are
trained directly from (2).
Such a model (2) is vulnerable when only few training
edges are available for a certain relation type. The small
number of edges will challenge the learning of the embedding vector r for the rare relation.
3.1. Inductive RGCN
Certain relation-types may be rare in the training set of
links and require a specialized architecture. To address
such a few-shot scenario, we introduce a MLP to learn
the relation embeddings. Consider the node embeddings
{hnt } and {hnt′ } extracted from the ultimate layer of the
RGCN model where nt ∈ Vt and nt′ ∈ Vt′ . The proposed

MLP learns an embedding for the rth relation as follows
X
1
hr :=
(3)
σ(W1 σ(W2 (hnt ||hnt′ ))
|Er |
(nt ,nt′ )∈Er

where || denotes the vector concatenation. Note that the relation embedding hr is calculated as a nonlinear function
of the node embedding for all node pairs (nt , nt′ ) participating to a certain relation type (nt , nt′ ) ∈ Er . This allows
the I-RGCN to learn relation embeddings in an inductive
fashion. This model is supervised by the following loss
LFSLP := log(1 + exp(−y × h⊤
nt diag(hr )hnt′ ))

(4)

where h⊤
nt diag(hr )hnt′

denotes the triple score and y is −1
for the negative triples and 1 stands for the positive ones.
We create negative triples by fixing the head node of a positive triple and randomly selecting a tail node of the same
type as the original tail node. Differently from (2), the relation embedding hr is learned in an inductive fashion from
the participating node pairs (nt , nt′ ). Hence, upon learning
the MLP parameters W1 , W2 the relation embedding will
be computed with a forward pass. This obviates the fewshot learning hurdle and enables the model to generalize to
rare or even unseen relations.

4. Experiments
4.1. Few shot link prediction
Baselines.We consider the state-of-the-art KGE models RotatE (Sun et al., 2019), ComplEx (Trouillon et al., 2016),
and the RGCN model (Schlichtkrull et al., 2018) as baselines for comparison. The parameters of these methods
have been optimized via cross validation. We use the
IMDB and DBLP datasets (Fu et al., 2020) detailed in Table 1. The total number of edges in the few-shot relation
are 1559 for the IMDB and 3534 for the DBLP. In the experiments. we train with only K links from the few-shot
relation and all the links from the other relations and test on
the rest edges of the few-shot relation, which are |ER | − K.
The nodes in the IMDB and DBLP graphs are associated
with feature vectors. Further, information on the datasets is
included in the Appendix.
Tables 2 and 3 report the MRR, Hit-1 and Hit-10 scores of
the baseline methods along with the inductive RGCN and

the RGCN in the task of few-shot link prediction for the
IMDB and DBLP datasets respectively. The I-RGCN significantly outperforms the alternative methods in the task of
few-shot link prediction. Specifically, for K=10 the MRR
of the inductive method is one order of magnitude greater.
This corroborates the advantage of the inductive relation
learning for the few-shot learning task. As the number of
training edges increases at K=1000, it is observed that the
RGCN performance approaches the performance of the IRGCN. This suggests that the I-RGCN method performs
well also in non few-shot learning tasks. The worse performance of KGE models is explained since these do not
account for node features and do learn inductive relation
embeddings.
To further validate the performance of the I-RGCN we conduct a general link prediction evaluation by splitting the
links in training, validation, and testing at random irrespective of their relation type. The results for different percentages of training links are reported in Table 4. I-RGCN
outperforms even in this training scenario the RGCN and
KGEs baselines, which further corroborates the efficiency
of the model.
4.2. Drug-repurposing via I-RGCN
For this experiment we will utilize the drug-repurposing
knowledge graph (DRKG) constructed in (Ioannidis et al.,
2020). The DRKG collects interactions from a collection of
biological databases such as Drugbank (DS et al., 2017b),
GNBR (Percha & Altman, 2018), Hetionet (DS et al.,
2017a), STRING (D et al., 2019), IntAct (Orchard et al.,
2014) and DGIdb (Cotto et al., 2017).
Drug-repurposing aims at discovering the most effective existing drugs to treat a certain disease. Drug-repurposing
can be formulated as predicting direct links in the DRKG
such as predicting whether a drug treats a disease or as predicting whether a compound inhibits a certain gene which
is related to the target disease. Drug-repurposing can be
viewed as a few-shot link prediction task since only a few
edges are available related to novel diseases in the DRKG.
We use corona-virus related diseases, including SARS,
MERS and SARS-COV2, as target diseases representing
Covid-19 as their functionality is similar. We aim at predicting links among gene entities associated with the target
disease and drug entities.We select FDA-approved drugs in
Drugbank as candidates, while we exclude for simplicity
drugs with molecule weight less than 250 daltons, as many
of certain drugs are actually health drugs. This amounts to
8104 candidate drugs.
We also obtain 442 Covid-19 related genes from the relations extracted from (Gordon et al., 2020; Zhou et al.,
2020). Similarly, we obtain the node embeddings for the

gene and drugs, and the embeddings for the corresponding
relations. Next, we score all triples and rank them per target gene. This way we obtain 442 ranked lists of drugs.
Finally, to assess whether our prediction is in par with the
drugs used for treatment, we check the overlap among the
top 100 predicted drugs and the drugs used in clinical trials
per gene. We used 32 clinical trial drugs for Covid-19 to
validate our predictions1. Table 5 lists the clinical drugs included in the top-100 predicted drugs across all the genes
with their corresponding number of hits for the RGCN and
I-RGCN. It can be observed, that several of the widely used
drugs in clinical trials appear high on the predicted list, and
that I-RGCN shows a higher hit rate than RGCN. Hence,
the inductive relation prediction module is more appriopriate in predicting links when information about the nodes is
limited, such as is the case with the novel Covid-19 disease
node.

5. Conclusion
In this paper we develop a novel I-RGCN that learns inductive relation embeddings and can be applied for fewshot link prediction and drug repurposing. I-RGCN consistently outperforms baseline models in the IMDB and
DBLP datasets for few-shot link prediciton. We also formulate the Covid-19 drug-repurposing task as a link prediction over the DRKG. I-RGCN successfully identifies a
subset of clinical trial drugs for Covid-19 and can be used

A. Datasets
We use the IMDB and DBLP datasets (Fu et al., 2020) detailed in Table 1, where the third column denotes the total size of edges in the few-shot relation that is |ER |. The
nodes in the IMDB and DBLP graphs are associated with
feature vectors. The original datasets in (Fu et al., 2020)
are used for node classification. We adapt the datasets and
create new edge types, where the edges are parametrized
by the label of the associated nodes. For example, the
edge type (director, directed, movie) becomes (director,
directed drama, movie) if the associated movie is in the
drama genre, and the same transformation undergoes the
(actor, played, movie) relation. Since, there are 3 labels for
movies, this way the original 4 edge types become 12. The
same transformation happens in the DBLP dataset.
