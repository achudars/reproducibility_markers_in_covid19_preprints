Abstract
Introduction: For COVID-19 patients’ accurate prediction of disease severity and mortality risk would greatly improve care
delivery and resource allocation. There are many patient-related factors, such as pre-existing comorbidities that affect disease
severity. Since rapid automated profiling of peripheral blood samples is widely available, we investigated how such data from
the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients might be used to predict clinical outcomes.
Methods: We thus investigated such clinical datasets from COVID-19 patients with known outcomes by combining statistical
comparison and correlation methods with machine learning algorithms; the latter included decision tree, random forest, variants
of gradient boosting machine, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbour and deep learning methods.
Results: Our work revealed several clinical parameters measurable in blood samples, which discriminated between healthy people and COVID-19 positive patients and showed predictive value for later severity of COVID-19 symptoms. We thus developed
a number of analytic methods that showed accuracy and precision for disease severity and mortality outcome predictions that
were above 90%.
Conclusions: In sum, we developed methodologies to analyse patient routine clinical data which enables more accurate prediction of COVID-19 patient outcomes. This type of approaches could, by employing standard hospital laboratory analyses of
patient blood, be utilised to identify, COVID-19 patients at high risk of mortality and so enable their treatment to be optimised.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) has caused the current pandemic of coronavirus disease-19
(COVID-19), which first emerged as an outbreak in December
2019 in the Chinese province of Hubei [1]. The management
of COVID-19 infected patients remains problematic and controversial, although this is to be expected in such a recently
emerged disease. The first symptoms of COVID-19 resemble
those of many other infections and inflammatory conditions
that affect the respiratory system and include fever, sneezing
and rhinitis, persistent cough and fatigue with general aches
and pains [2]. However, an infected patient can rapidly develop
further more severe symptoms which can be life-threatening
and require intensive care intervention; these include pneumonia, severe shortage of breath, diarrhoea, dispersed thromboses
and vascular inflammation [3]. A further issue in caring for
COVID-19 patients is the presence of comorbidities that interact with COVID-19, particularly pulmonary and vascular conditions, that can make the patient prognosis far worse. This
is an important consideration given the current lack of availability of a vaccine or effective therapy for COVID-19. However, there have been notable advances in treating patients with
advanced disease and indeed the common recognition of the
importance that the primary defenses against COVID-19 are
public health measures have reduced its spread.
Intensive care units (ICUs) are key to improving the survival of patients with severe COVID-19, providing oxygen, 24hour monitoring and care and assisted ventilation when needed.
Therefore thus, ICU beds are a precious resource in locations
where COVID-19 case numbers are high [4]. Therefore, allocating hospital wards or ICU beds for infected patients require
rapid decision-making processes, both to utilise resources efficiently and reduce patient suffering and mortality. In many
parts of the world, stressed care systems face significant difficulty in deciding on ICU bed allocation, so a smart, automated
system could be useful to improve care and resource allocation.
The World Health Organization has recommended that all suspected COVID-19 patients be tested by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based diagnosis methods
that directly detect viral RNA [5]. Testing by approaches other
than RT-PCR does not yet show acceptable accuracy. However, RT-PCR tests can take many hours or days to finalise the
test outcomes by which time the health condition and infectious status of confirmed patients may deteriorate. Rather than
seeking a new single rapid test that improves on RT-PCR, an alternative approach could be to use results from many different
profiling tests that are already available and which can be performed quickly by existing equipment [6, 35-36]. How best to
use the resulting such multidimensional data is currently con-

troversial.
Rapid blood and serology testing of clinical samples by current equipment enables monitoring of many peripheral blood
parameters of interest, some of which indicate changes in organ functions and are used to diagnose a range of conditions
diseases [7]. This raises the possibility that such profiling of
blood samples could provide predictive information about the
disease trajectory and risk of comorbidities for patients with
COVID-19. Some data is already used in physician deliberations, but the many available test parameters suggest that an
agnostic statistical or machine learning approach would improve the quality of those decisions. We, therefore, undertook a
comprehensive assessment that examined the utility of a range
of statistical and ML approaches. Indeed, our work identified
algorithms that showed significantly improved outcome estimates. This work has, therefore, the potential to optimise the
decision processes regarding patient care by clinicians that are
under significant time and resource pressure during the current
COVID-19 pandemic situation.

Materials and Methods
We used two different datasets in our work, the first of which
included data from 89 patients and second from 1,945 patients
of confirmed positive COVID-19 cases identified by RT-PCR
testing. In the first dataset [8] we use some statistical methods
like student’s t-test, chi-square test and Pearson’s correlation
to identify the most significant and associative blood parameters that can strongly distinguish between COVID-19 positive
patients and healthy people. In the second dataset [9] we use
some statistical methods and several machine learning models
to identify similar significant blood parameters that can predict severe patients between critical and non-critical COVID19 positive patients. Figure 1 depicts the schematic diagram of
the overall workflow of our approach.
We formularized the task of identifying severe COVID-19
patients for their appropriate ward selection as a classification problem by training machine learning models with features from COVID-19 patients’ data. Raw data were collected from the datasets of interest underwent a data wrangling
pipeline including denoising, missing value imputation, transformation, normalization, and partition. Next, several statistical comparisons and correlation methods were adopted for
feature engineering, including Student’s t-test, chi-square test,
and Pearson’s correlations. Next, each dataset was further
split into three categories based on criteria of existing NonCommunicable Disease (NCD): with NCD, without NCD and
all data. Finally, a range of state-of-the-art machine learning
methods were trained and evaluated. The algorithms used in2

cluded decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), extreme gradient boosting machine (XGBoost), support vector machine (SVM), light gradient boosting
machine (LGBM), k-nearest neighbours (KNN), and artificial
neural network (ANN)-based deep learning sequential models .
Each of these steps are discussed in the following subsections.

Data Collection
We have collected two different COVID-19 patients’ datasets.
The first was produced by Zenodo [8], and contains demographic information and blood sample information from 89
COVID-19 positive patients. In this dataset, 31 patients were
alive at the point of data collection, while 58 patients had
died prior to collection. The second larger dataset was obtained from the Kaggle online resource [9], which contains
the grouped information of previous diseases, blood sample results, and vital sign data of 1,945 COVID-19 positive patients.
The primary sources of this dataset are Brazilian hospitals that
include Sirio Libanes, São Paulo and Brasilia. The parameters
of the dataset included patient age percentiles, gender and demographic information. Some patients have pre-existing noncommunicable diseases (NCD), including hypertension and
immunocompromised status. The blood parameters examined
included the following: serum albumin, base excess arterial,
base excess venous, bicarbonate arterial, bicarbonate venous,
bilirubin, blast, calcium, creatinine, labels of free fatty acids
(FFA), Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), glucose, hematocrit, haemoglobin, international normalised ratio (INR), lactate, numbers of leukocytes, lymphocytes neutrophils, partial
pressure oxygen (PO2) arterial, PO2 venous, partial pressure
carbon dioxide (PCO2) arterial, PCO2 venous, pH arterial, pH
venous, platelets, potassium, O2 saturation arterial, O2 saturation venous, sodium, aspartate aminotransferase (AST/TGO),
alanine aminotransferase (ALT/ TGP), TTPA, urea, heart rate,
respiratory rate, temperature, oxygen saturation, systolic and
diastolic blood pressure. During the feature engineering phase
in our study, all of these blood parameters were considered as
features.

Identification of significant routine blood parameters for
SARS-CoV-2 infections
Data Processing
For the Zenodo dataset [8] that consists of 89 COVID-19 positive patients, we first removed any unwanted parameters (e.g.,
ethnicity, BMI, drinking or smoking habit, etc.). We then eliminated all those missing values, resulting in a dataset of 70 patients. In the Sirio Libanes dataset [9] from Kaggle, there were
1,945 individual patients with 54 types of tests. The primary

dataset contained a large number of missing values. The rationale behind the removal of entries with missing parameter
value is that, when we conducted a pilot study with the imputation of missing values with mean, median, or regression values,
a poor predictive performance was observed. Therefore, we
eliminated entries which contained at least one missing value.
This elimination resulted in 545 sets of patient data entries in
the second dataset that contains no missing values. Among
the patients of this dataset, 264 had symptoms severe enough
to be admitted into ICU. Both datasets underwent a denoising
step, where we removed unwanted strings. Standard scaling
techniques performed feature scaling that is the mean value of
the data will be 0 with variance value 1; this will be calculated as a mean value of a feature is subtracted from original
value then divided by standard deviation. After preprocessing,
we consider 545 patients data for the analysis. For the precise
study, then we divided this dataset according to whether a patient had a coexisting non-communicable disease (NCD) or not
(no NCD). We found 264 NCD patients and 281 without NCDs
patients, among which NCD and no NCD groups included 156
and 108 patients (respectively) that were classed as displaying
severe conditions. After this data preparation and preprocessing, we have considered all these data for the statistical analysis, and we randomly selected 80% of the grouped patients data
for model training and the rest for model validation testing.

Statistical methods to identify the most significant and associative blood parameters
In the statistical analysis, we used chi-square tests for categorical variables, Student’s t-test for continuous variables and Pearson’s correlation among various blood samples counts. The
null hypothesis was: the data from both of the COVID-19 patient and healthy population were indistinguishable. Significant blood parameters were chosen based on P value < 0.05,
while in some cases the selection criteria were adj. p−value <
0.05 and absolute value log2 fold-change(LF C) < 1. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering was conducted on Pearson’s correlation coefficients for significant grouping parameters [10–
12].

Machine learning models to classify COVID-19 patient
severity
To identify a set of important blood samples as a feature selection step, we have employed a set of machine learning (ML)
algorithms using COVID-19 dataset that included data from
severe and non-severely affected patients. We chose those
ML algorithms that are supervised in performing classification
tasks with superior performance and fast execution [13, 34].
For this purpose, we have considered a basic ensemble learn3

ing approach that is based on max voting, averaging, and
weighted-averaging and the advanced ensemble learning algorithms works with stacking, blending, bagging, and boosting.
The ensemble learning algorithms are the combinations of one
or more basic algorithms that are high performing, efficient,
effective, and easy to debug [14, 15].
We next address the parameters of ML algorithms that were
used when it was run. In the DT algorithm, we used the random state as 42, criterion as ‘gini,’ and the minimum sample
split was 2. Similarly, in the RF algorithm, the minimum sample split was two, and the number of estimators was 100. The
SVM algorithm sets a linear kernel, cache size 200, and 3rd degree. In the GBM algorithm, the learning rate was 0.1, criterion
‘f riedmanm se,’ and the number of estimators 100. The learning rate in the LGBM algorithm was 0.05, feature fraction 0.9,
bagging fraction 0.8, and bagging frequency 5. In the XGB
algorithm, we used a tree-based booster, and max depth was
six, learning rates 0.1, and the number of estimators 1000. For
the KNN algorithms, the matrices we used were Minkowski;
weights were uniform, and the number of neighbours was 3
(k=3).
We have also experimented with a deep learning model, i.e. a
feed-forward one-dimensional artificial neural network (ANN),
e.g., sequential model. This model consists of an input layer,
three hidden layers, and an output layer [16]. Each layer contains a collection of parallel processing nodes, called neurons,
which takes input from the nodes of the previous layer. All
the hidden layers are ReLU (Rectified Linear Units)-activated,
and the output layer is softmax activated, providing the class
probability of the input sample. The network was trained in
1000 epochs using the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithm with categorical cross-entropy loss as a

Evaluation matrices for machine learning models
We evaluated the performance of our models using precision,
recall, f1 score, the area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUC-ROC) and log-loss function. The precision
indicates the proportion of true positive instances among all the
positive instances [17] and the recall indicates the proportion
of what the actual true instances measure from the whole instances [17]. Between precision and recall, we calculated the f1
score metrics for better evaluations. This is the harmonic mean
of precision and recall [17]. The AUC of a classifier is equivalent to the likelihood that the classifier will rank a randomly
picked positive value higher than a randomly picked negative
value [18]. Logarithmic Loss or log-loss value is used in multi-

nomial logistic regression. The classifier gives probability to
each class for all the class samples. If the p is the number of
samples which are belonging to q numbers of classes. Then the
log-loss function can be calculated as:
p

q

1 XX
Log − loss = −
xij log(yij )
p i=1 j=1

(1)

where xij denotes whether p belongs to class i or not, and yij
denotes whether q belongs to class j. Log Loss closer to 0
demonstrates higher accuracy. Without proper evaluation of
the ML model utilizing various matrices and relying on the accuracy, it can bring an issue when the model is conveyed on
unseen data and can bring about inaccurate predictions.

Figure 4. Age distribution of COVID-19 patients for every patients group

We worked with two scenarios of COVID-19 patients analysis,
in the first scenario we applied Student’s t-test and Pearson’s
correlation to COVID-19 positive patients blood cell parameters and normal range of blood cell parameters we found that
both tests support predictive value of C-reactive blood protein,
procalcitonin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, brain natriuretic
peptide, ferritin, and D-Dimer are significant for COVID-19
positive patients. In the second scenario, we accounted for only
COVID-19 patients for severity calculation. We also applied
two different analysis approaches. These were Student’s t-test,
the other a machine learning method of these approaches found
that respiratory rate, lactate, blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), haemoglobin, hematocrit, base excess venous and arterial, neutrophils, albumin, urea, platelet count and potassium
were good indicators of patient disease severity and a small set
of a predictor of COVID-19 severity measurements.
The demographic information for the patient data is shown
in Table 1, comparing the patients with severe and non-severe
symptoms. The patients (n=545) included 198 (36.33%) were
female, 257 (47.16%) were above 65 years of age, and 264
(48.44%) were admitted into ICU. Among the group that included only patients with no NCDs (n=281), 107 (38.08%)
were female, and 108 (38.43%) patients were admitted to ICU.
Moreover, in the patient group that had one or more NCDs
(n=264), 167 (63.26%) patients are over 65 years old, and 156
(59.09%) were admitted into the ICU beds. The age distribution is shown in Figure 4.
Our first dataset contained 89 confirmed COVID-19 positive patient blood parameters. We hence performed a Student’s t-test of tested blood parameters to compare the ex-

pected range values (shown in Figure 2) with COVID-19 patients from the first dataset. According to the t-test analyses, the
more likely informative blood parameters were immature grans
(abs), haemoglobin A1C, fibrinogen, lipase, albumin, red blood
cell count, estimated glomerular filtration rate, C-reactive protein and partial thromboplastin time. The combination of ttest and log2 fold changes (LFC) indicated that the eight (08)
most significant candidate predictive parameters for COVID19 positive status were lipase, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin
level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, brain natriuretic peptide,
ferritin, D-Dimer, and creatine kinase level, which all showed
p-values less than 0.001 and absolute LF C > 1.
We applied Student’s t-test to the a second dataset to attempt
to discriminate severe and non-severe symptom COVID-19
positive patients by finding patients characteristics which are
associated with the target variable disease severity; the analysis results are shown in Figure 5. According to t-test results
from the most significant features of COVID-19 patients that
imply the patient severity is the patient’s hospital visit identifier, age, gender, previous co-existing diseases with hypertension. The most significant blood parameters according to t-test
results were lactate, respiratory rate, diastolic blood pressure,
haemoglobin, hematocrit, base excess venous, leukocytes, neutrophils, albumin, base excess arterial, urea, platelets count,
potassium and systolic blood pressure.

Clustering and co-expression analysis
We also performed Pearson’s correlation between the different
routine blood parameters. The Pearson correlation is shown
in Figure 3. And we found that there are some hierarchical
clusters of the tests that showed significance equally for all
the patients. From the total 59 blood samples, we found that
there were four (04) different most concordant clusters that are
strongly correlated with each other. The first cluster comprised
pulse pressure and systolic blood pressure. The second comprised haemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cells. The third
cluster was built with C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, diastolic blood pressure, and respiratory rate. Procalcitonin levels, ferritin, and creatine kinase levels composed
the fourth cluster.

Prediction of severe COVID-19 patients for critical treatment using machine models
In this section, we first describe the performances of used machine learning models and their applications. We then present
the most important reduced set of blood and physical sign parameters that can precisely discriminate the patients with severe disease from those with non-severe disease. The reduced

collection of blood parameters, also known as significance for
severe COVID-19 positive patients’.
For the machine learning analysis for the second dataset, we
applied the respective methods and models; their performances
and the evaluation matrices are shown in Table 2. In the data
group of all patients with and without NCDs, we found that
RF and GBM gave the highest testing accuracy score 89% and
the other methods and models perform with above 80% testing accuracy score. The highest Area Under the ROC curve
(AUC) score is for RF, and GBM 89% and also other methods
and models scored ethical AUC values above 80%. The highest
precision values were seen for XGB and GBM with 91%. The
highest Recall values are for KNN 93%, RF and LGBM score
90% and other methods scores above 80%. The best F1-score
is 90% for RF and others have above 80%. RF and GBM have
the lowest log loss value of 3.8%, and other methods and models also have ethical lowest values below 7%. In this patient
group, we saw that all of our applied models achieve good performance in every evaluation matrix with above 80% accuracy
score, so in practice any of those can be employed.
In the data group of patients who have no NCDs, we found
that RF performed with the highest accuracy score of 93%,
LGBM and XGB performed with 91% and SVM, DT performed with a good accuracy score above 80%. Nevertheless,
KNN and ANN showed comparatively low accuracy scores
74%, because when we divide the dataset the size of data being small. RF performed with the highest AUC score, 92%,
LGBM 91% and XGB 90%. LGBM have the highest precision
value, 91%, RF and XGB have 89%. The highest precision values were91% for LGBM, and other methods and models have
above 80% except for KNN (74%). The highest recall values
were for RF 100%, XGB and GBM 97%, and other methods
and models had above 80%, except ANN (48%). RF scores
highest F1-score 94%, XGB 93%, LGBM 92% and SVM and
DT scores 88%. However, KNN and ANN scored comparatively lowly, with 78% and 62% respectively because of lower
training sample sizes. The lowest log loss value was 2.42%
for RF, and other methods and models also perform with good
log loss values below 10%. In this patient group, we observed that excepting KNN and ANN all of the model accuracy scores were above 80%, and the evaluation matrix showed
good model performances. So, the best performing models
could usefully be applied in clinical scenarios.
In the data group of patients who had one or more coexisting
NCDs, we found that LGBM performed with highest accuracy
score 93%, and RF, GBM, XGB, SVM, and DT performed with
91%, 89%, 87%, 84%, and 84%, respectively. KNN and ANN
performed poorly but this was due to the small amount of available data showing 77% and 74% accuracy, respectively. The
highest AUC score was 92% for LGBM and RF, SVM, DT,

We also observed that beyond blood parameters, some vital signs of COVID-19 patients also predicted disease severity.

Patient gender, age, coexisting diseases (such as hypertension)
were also found to be significant for these patient data groups
of data.

Discussion
After the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, classification of
disease mortality risk are of very great significance in prevention, and treatment allocation. In this investigation, we found
a number of blood analysis parameters that can be used as risk
factors for the assessment of likely disease severity in COVID19 patients. We developed predictive algorithms that utilised a
large number of blood parameters and demonstrated that these
methods and the potential to predict the disease severity of
COVID-19 patients with high accuracy.
We identified a number of features of patient data that contributed strongly to the predicted value of the algorithms (i.e.,
were found to contribute to the accuracy of all our best machine learning algorithms) some of whom were not obvious
candidate predictors. We found that the absolute value of lymphocytes in the severe symptom group of patients was consistently lower than that of the non-severe symptom group. The
neutrophil parameters of the severe symptom group was higher
than that of the non-severe symptom group. The latter characteristics indicated a level of immune activation heightened
and possibly playing a role in the “inflammatory storm” that
is a characteristic of COVID-19 severe symptoms which result
in very high tissue and cell harm [19]. Low lymphocyte levels may reflect impeded antibody-based immune cell functions
suspected to result in patients with severe COVID-19 susceptible to bacterial infection [20]. The algorithm outcomes indicated that numbers of circulating lymphocytes in the patients
who developed severe symptoms was significantly lower than
those who did not have severe symptoms. In contrast, the inclusion of neutrophils in the severe ICU patients’ was influenced
higher, which is consistent with the consequences of Qin et al.
[21].
We found that the indicator factors could be reliable to
predictors that discriminated between severe and non-severe
COVID-19 patients. Recent work has uncovered the utility of
routine blood parameters in the screening of COVID-19 patients. This is facilitated by the fact that blood parameter analysis is generally fast, affordable, and promptly accessible in the
same health facility where patients are receiving treatment. The
pathological tests of COVID-19 patients identified some abnormalities in some blood parameters. Previous published data
has identified a number of altered blood parameters inCOVID19 patients who develop severe symptoms include in addition
to the lymphocyte and neutrophil parameters noted above, are,
10

Sakifa Aktar et al.
eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, platelets and total leukocytes as well as serum levels of urea, potassium, haemoglobin
and C-reactive blood protein. [22–24], which provides supportive evidence for our findings. Li et al. identified that COVID19 affects bacterial pneumonia in some cases of mortality [25].
Bacterial contamination also causes expanded leucocyte count
and neutrophil count, which may be linked to defective immune responses. A few patients with COVID-19 have abnormal blood coagulation function: prothrombin time is increased,
and D-dimer is raised [19]; thrombosis is linked with expanded
platelet consumption and diminished platelet number.
Respiratory rate is one of the principal vital signs for patient symptom severity in COVID-19. Abnormally high respiratory rates (<12 or >25 breaths/min) are also seen in a range
of conditions including asthma, heightened anxiety, pneumonia, congestive heart failure, lung disease (all of which exacerbate COVID-19 conditions when presenting as comorbidities)
and are a significant feature in severely affected COVID-19 patients [26, 27]. Elevated heart rate is similarly a key sign [28]
and may be the cause of dizziness or shortness of breath in
COVID-19 patients [29]. Blood pressure is additionally a clinical sign for COVID-19 patients [30]. Hypoxemia is also a sign
that indicates the average below level of oxygen saturation in
the blood. The usual range of arterial oxygen is 75 to 100 (mm
Hg) approximately, and in pulse oximeter reading the expected
range from 95% to 100%; below 90% indicates patients’ condition is critical [31], and this is often observed in COVID-19
patients who may lack other obvious symptoms, making it a
particularly dangerous feature of the disease. Related to this is
the serum lactic acid test, which is also a significant test that
indicates disease severity in COVID-19 patients. Typically the
level of lactate in the blood is very low, but when it rises it is
typically associated with low oxygen levels [32, 33].
In summary there are a number of signs and symptoms that
can indicate COVID-19 is likely to become severe in a patient.
What is needed is a standardised and objective way to combine
these and other less obvious predictors in a way that can optimise patient outcomes and resource management. Our methodology, described here and derived from a number of different
machine learning algorithms, can provide such an improved
method. Indeed the fact that high accuracy was obtained using
similar predictors by different machine learning algorithms (so
there is limited sensitivity to methodology) can give confidence
that these parameters are of utility, and the approach is a sound
one.

Conclusion
The results of our analysis indicated that there is a strong relationship between particular abnormal blood parameters and

disease severity status in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.
The primary utility of our findings is that the subset of routine
blood parameters linked to disease severity could be used in a
predictive algorithm that would better enable appropriate care
to be given before the onset of severe symptoms. This is of particular importance in developing countries, where the hospitals
where ICU beds are a limited resource. This can be achieved
using a relatively small number of currently available hospital blood-based tests to proper utilisation of ICU resources and
identifying patients that need to be monitored closely.
Among the association between blood parameters that are
able to give predictive information regarding COVID-19 symptoms severity, the levels of C-reactive blood protein appeared
to have the strongest predictive value. Levels of haemoglobin,
procalcitonin, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, brain natriuretic
peptide, ferritin, D-Dimer, and platelets were likewise showed
significant deviation from the normal control group in this.
Other parameters, respiratory rate, lactate, blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), hematocrit, base excess venous and arterial,
neutrophils, albumin, and urea showed less obvious deviations
but clearly had predictive value. Our work suggests that links
between these parameters and COVID-19, and perhaps similar
pro-inflammatory infectious diseases are worth more detailed
physiological investigations.
There were a few limitations to our study. Firstly, the small
sample size may restrict the precision of the severity identification. Secondly, the absence of more detailed clinical information in the datasets that were used (such as patients’ age, sex
and comorbidities), which may hinder better classification, although it suggests that future studies with new datasets could
address this and improve on our work. Finally, the disease
severity and mortality of COVID-19 varies significantly from
country to country, for reasons that are very poorly understood
but suggests that this type of predictive analysis should be carried out on data from other parts of the world to improve performance of the algorithm. Nevertheless, we hope our study
can be used by practitioners, facilitates sound policy-makers to
improve resource allocation and patient outcomes for COVID19 patients.
