Abstract
The cumulative number of confirmed infected individuals by the new coronavirus outbreak until April 30th ,
2020, is presented for the countries: Belgium, Brazil, United Kingdom (UK), and United States of America
(USA). After an initial period with a low incidence of newly infected people, a power-law growth of the
number of confirmed cases is observed. For each country, a distinct growth exponent is obtained. For
Belgium, UK, and USA, countries with a large number of infected people, after the power-law growth a
distinct behavior is obtained when approaching saturation. Brazil is still in the power-law regime. Such
updates of the data and projections corroborate recent results regarding the power-law growth of the virus
and their strong Distance Correlation between some countries around the world. Furthermore, we show
that act in time is one of the most relevant non-pharmacological weapons that the health organizations have
in the battle against the COVID-19, infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus.
We study how changing the social distance and the number of daily tests to identify infected asymptomatic
individuals can interfere in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 when applied in three distinct days,
namely April 16th (early), April 30th (current), and May 14th (late). Results show that containment actions
are necessary to flatten the curves and should be applied as soon as possible.

1. Introduction
Since the first infection of the coronavirus in December 2019, observed in Wuhan (China), the virus has
spread around the world very quickly and nowadays 215 countries, areas, or territories1 report confirmed
cases of the infection. Innumerable scientists in distinct areas are using their knowledge in the battle against
the still evolving COVID-19 outbreak around the globe. The daily analysis of data about the spreading of
the virus and possible interpretations that allow us to track and control the virus are of most relevance. It
is a timely appeal to find explanations and models which may allow us to better understand the evolution
of the viruses, saving lives, and avoiding economic and social catastrophes [2].
In the battle against the COVID-19 spreading, some models focus on the geographical spread of the virus
[3, 4], while others remain restricted to a given area, or country, but analyze the local temporal development
of the epidemic. In the context of diseases, in 1760 Daniel Bernoulli proposed a mathematical model of
disease propagation and showed the efficiency of the preventive inoculation technique against smallpox [5].
This model included susceptible and immune individuals [6]. Later on, Kermack and McKendrick [7] came
up with the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. During the last years, other more sophisticated
models have been proposed like the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model [8, 9, 10] and

its modified versions [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Both approaches, the geographical spread, and the local temporal
evolution are of most relevance.
It is well-known that the decisive quantity used to regulate the dynamical evolution of epidemics, in
general, is the average reproductive number R0 , which gives the number of secondary infected individuals
generated by a primary infected individual. While for values R0 < 1 the number of newly infected individuals
decreases exponentially, for 1 < R0 < ∞ it increases exponentially [16, 17]. Starting from the primordial
exponential solution put up by Verhulst in 1838, the well known logistic model for the law of population
growth [18], models were improved more and more in the last decades to better describe the nonlinear
and complex comportments which occur in our environment. In fact, in many realistic systems, power-law
functions are the law of growth (or decrease), as in the branching processes with a diverging reproductive
number [16], in scale free networks and small worlds [19], and in foraging in biological systems [20]. Indeed,
recent investigations showed a power-law growth of the cumulative number of infected individuals by the
new coronavirus [11, 12, 21, 22], which might be typical of small world networks [23] and possibly related
to fractal kinetics and graph theory [24].
Recently, we have shown that power-law growth is observed in countries from four distinct continents
[11] until March 27th , 2020. The considered countries were: Brazil, China, Germany, Italy, France, Japan,
Spain, Republic of Korea, and the United States of America (USA). One leading observation was that
after an initial time with a low incidence of newly infected people, the growth of the cumulative number
of confirmed cases for all studied countries followed a power-law. The Distance Correlation [25, 26, 27, 28]
between these countries was found to be very strong and suggest a universal characteristic of the virus
spreading. One of the goals of the present work is to update to April 30th , 2020 the time-series analysis for
the COVID-19 growth for the countries Brazil and USA. We included Belgium and United Kingdom (UK)
on this list and leave out the other countries which are reaching the saturation regime.
Figure 1 displays the cumulative number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 (empty circles) as a function
of time for four exemplary countries: Belgium [Fig. 1(a)], Brazil [Fig. 1(b)], UK [Fig. 1(c)], and USA [Fig
1(d)]. Data were collected from the situation reports published daily by the World Health Organization
(WHO) [1]. We call to attention that the values in the vertical axis in Fig. 1 change for different countries.
Initial data, regarding the days with less than 100 infected individuals, were discarded. The black-continuous
curves represent the function ∝ tµ that fits the time series and the exponent µ for each country is indicated
in each panel. The insets display the same curves but in the log-log plot. Straight lines in the log-log plot
indicate power-law growth. The only country for which the power-law growth still takes place is Brazil,
as shown in Fig. 1(b). The reason is that it is still away from the saturation point. This is different for
Belgium, UK, and USA, as can be seen in Figs. 1(a), 1(c), and 1(d), respectively. Dashed-black lines in
these three panels are projections in case the power-law would have guided the growth.
Besides the above updates, in this paper, we describe in detail the modified SEIR model which was used
recently [11] to propose strategies to flatten the power-law curves. It is shown how to adjust the parameters
of the model to real data. Furthermore, using the same model we discuss what would be the effect of early,
current, and late non-pharmacological actions to flatten the curves of the four countries shown in Fig. 1.
This clearly shows that each day lost by delaying non-pharmacological actions can cost many lives.
The paper is divided as follows. In Sec. 2 we present in detail the model used in this work. Section 3
discusses the effect of containment actions on the total number of confirmed infected cases applied in three
distinct days and Sec. 4 summarizes our results.

are also listed. The highlight lines in Table 1 call to attention to the variable C, which is the main quantity
analyzed in this work, to the adjustable parameters θ and κs , and to the strategic parameter κa . After the
adjustment, the parameters θ and κa will be varied to give rise to specific strategies. Worth to mention that
θ = γR0 , where R0 is the basic reproductive number without social distance actions, and γ is the interaction
factor between individuals. This factor can be interpreted as the ratio between the average of the daily
social interaction due to the applied social distance actions and the case with no actions at all. Larger social
distance implies smaller values of θ, which is equivalent to reduce R0 . The distinction between θ and R0
allows us to identify the direct effects of the actions in the battle against the pandemic. Thus, the ideal
situation would be to find θ < 1.
Figure 2 is a schematic representation of the model, showing the variables and the connections between
them through the parameters. Condensing the explanation of the schema, starting from the left, susceptible
individuals S develop into exposed individuals E by a rate θ(Is + αIa )/(N Tinf ) which, after a latent
time Tlat , become symptomatic Is or asymptomatic Ia with the rate (1 − β)/Tlat and β/Tlat , respectively.
Applying daily tests in a rate κs (κa ) to identify symptomatic (asymptomatic) infected individuals, they are
immediately sent to quarantine Q, staying there for a time Tser before recovering (R). On the other hand,
infected individuals who have not been tested are sent to the class R after the infection time Tinf . Matter
of fact, since no vaccine has been developed until today, the model does not contain an immunization term.
No rigid quarantine is taken into account. Furthermore, in Eq. (5), the factor Tser dividing Q represents a
rate of exit from the quarantine (to the group R).
2.2. Adjusting parameters to real data
It is known that for systems composed of differential equations with r unknown parameters, 2r + 1
experiments with real data are needed to obtain all the information that is potentially available about the
parameters [30]. Since in our case we have only two adjustable parameters (r = 2), we need at least 5
real data to adjust parameters correctly. This minimum value is automatically taken into account in all
numerical simulations when adjusting the parameters.
Empty circles in Fig. 3 are the real data for the cumulative number of confirmed cases of COVID-19
f
for the four countries analyzed. To find the best values for the pairs (θ, κs ) = (θef f , κef
s ) that fit the real
data and the best time-series split in periods Pi , we performed simulations varying θ ∈ [0.5, 5.0] using a step
equal to 0.1 and κs ∈ [0.0, 1.0] using a step equal to 0.05 and testing different combinations of periods Pi ,

always obeying the minimum amount of real data requested in each period. The goal of these simulations
is to minimize the mean square error between the numerical results and real data. Thereon, we need five
pairs of parameters in Fig. 3(a), namely P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 , and P5 for Belgium, and six pairs of parameters for
the other countries, seen in Fig. 3,(b)-3(d). Details of the adjustable parameters are given in Table 2. The
initial condition E(t0 ) for the variable E(t) is determined inside the first period P1 of the data considering
the interval E(t0 ) ∈ [C(t0 )/5, 10C(t0 )] using a step equal C(t0 )/5, where C(t0 ) is the cumulative number
of confirmed cases obtained from the WHO data for the first day in P1 . We do not start the parameter
adjustment from the first day of reported infections, but later on. The model produces better results in such
cases.
After adjusting the parameters to the real data, the black-continuous curves in Fig. 3 display the results of
integrating equations of the model. We observe that these curves nicely reproduce the data in all cases. When
real data are not available anymore, the black-continuous curves represent projections of the cumulative

number of infected individuals until the day 150, considering that the pair (θef f , κef
s ) found in the last
period will not be changed.

3. Containment measures: early, current and late actions
In this section, we discuss the effects of distinct strategies applied in different days on the total number
of infected individuals. Essentially we discuss two strategies:
(i) vary the degree of the social distance;
(ii) for a constant value of the social distance, vary the number of daily tests that allow identifying and
isolating the infected asymptomatic individuals.
3.1. The social distance effect
As mentioned before, Fig. 3 displays the real data (empty circles) and black-continuous curves which
were adjusted to fit the data. The results are shown for Belgium in Fig. 3(a), Brazil in Fig. 3(b), UK in

Figure 3: The cumulative number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the countries: (a) Belgium, (b) Brazil, (c) UK, and (d)
USA. Empty circles are the real data and the black-continuous curves are the results from the simulations. Colors are related
to social distance actions applied in distinct days (discussed in the text).

Fig. 3(c), and USA in Fig. 3(d). During the integration of the ODEs of the model, it is possible to change
the parameter θ which represents the amount of social distance. Therefore, we changed this parameter from
0.5 to 2.5 using a step of 0.002 in three distinct dates, namely April 16th (green-dashed curves), April 30th
(blue-dashed curves), and May 14th (red-dashed curves). Curves with dark colors are related to θ = 2.5,
and light colors to θ = 0.5. Worth mention that high values of θ mean low degrees of social distance, what
can potentialize the epidemic spread. We clearly see, in the case of Belgium for example, that strong social
distance strategies (θ = 0.5) can flatten the curves for the three distinct days. However, their efficiency in
flattening the curves becomes less for later days (see blue and red light dashed curves). On the other hand,
if social distance strategies are relaxed to θ = 2.5 in Belgium, when compared to θef f = 0.7 obtained for the
last period P5 (see Table 2), the number of infected people increases very much. Furthermore, if you wait
longer to relax the social distance, days April 30th (blue-dashed curves) or May 14th (red-dashed curves),
for example, the total number of infected cases diminishes. Essentially the same behavior is observed for all
the other countries analyzed. Please see Figs. 3(b)-3(d). In all these simulations the values κs = 1.0 and
κa = 0 were kept fixed.

6

3.2. Testing asymptomatic individuals
At next, we keep the social distance parameter constant at θ = 2.0, set κs = 1.0, and change the daily
rate of identification of asymptomatic infected individuals. The choice for this strategy is that without tests
it is impossible to recognize that asymptomatic individuals are infected. In the simulations, we varied κa
from 0.1 to 1.0 using a step of 0.009. Results are presented in Fig. 4 for the same countries from Fig. 3.
For better visualization, we start the plot at later times when compared to Fig. 3. Figures 4(a), 4(c), 4(e),
and 4(g) display the total cumulative number of confirmed infected cases and Figs. 4(b), 4(d), 4(f), and
4(h) show the cumulative number of only symptomatic infected individuals. Strategies are again applied in
days April 16th (green-dashed curves), April 30th (blue-dashed curves), and May 14th (red-dashed curves).
Curves with dark colors are related to κa = 1.0 and curves with light colors to κa = 0.1. This constant
can be interpreted as follows: κa = 0.1, for example, represents a daily rate of identification and isolation
of 10% of all asymptomatic infected individuals. This represents a huge number of daily tests for countries
like Brazil and USA, which have a large population.
To make it possible to compare the projection tendencies, for which κa = 0, and the scenarios shown in
Fig. 4, we compute the cumulative number of symptomatic infectious cases (B). In this quantity, asymptomatic cases or those with mild symptoms are not considered. Similar to the C variable, B is an auxiliary
variable of the model, obtained by integrating the ODE

Let us discuss results from Fig. 4 taking just one country: UK. In Fig. 4(e) we observe that the strategy
of realizing tests on asymptomatic individuals instantly increases the total number of confirmed cases. For
the largest value κa = 1.0 for example, the dark green curve increases very much on the day April 16th . For
κa = 0.1, the light green curve barely changes in this day. However, after around 15 days, both curves cross
each other and the dark green curve asymptotically converges to a much smaller value than the light green
curve, which shows that the realization of a huge amount of daily tests to identify and isolate asymptomatic
individuals is also an efficient strategy that could be applied to relax the social distance (increase the value
of θ). Nevertheless, it is important to mention that, for countries with large populations, values κa ≈ 1.0 are
not practical parameters. The same behavior can be observed when the tests are applied in days April 30th
(blue-dashed curves) and May 14th (red-dashed curves). Essentially an analogous interpretation is valid for
the other countries. One difference is observed for Brazil. In Fig. 4(c) we can see that all the dashed curves
cross the black-continuous curve of the tendency, meaning that even the late actions were able to diminish
the number of infected individuals. It occurs because the constant value θ = 2.0 is lower than the θef f = 2.1
obtained in the last period P6 for Brazil (see Table 2). For the other countries, this is not the case since the
black-continuous curves had a smaller value of θef f at P6 , or P5 for Belgium (see Table 2), when compared
to θ = 2.0 used in Fig. 4.
At next, we discuss some projections for the cumulative number of symptomatic infected individuals,
shown in Figs. 4(b) for Belgium, 4(d) for Brazil, 4(f) for UK, and 4(h) for USA. Now, we take the example
of USA. When increasing the value of θ from θef f = 1.10 (see Table 2) to θ = 2.0 and setting κa = 1.0,
on April 16th , the dark green curve tends to flatten the growth of the cumulative number of symptomatic
infected cases. On the other hand, for κa = 0.1, the tendency is to increase such quantity when compared to
the black-continuous curve. This projects bad news for USA in case they relax the social distance (increase
the value of θ) and apply a small number of tests to the identification of asymptomatic infected individuals.
Similar behavior is observed for the other countries. The only difference is for Brazil, shown in Fig. 4(d),
where the black-continuous curve is lying above the dashed curves once the value of θ used in these strategies
is lower than the θef f obtained in P6 for Brazil. The projections tend to get worst as the application day
of the strategy is delayed.
4. Conclusions
The cumulative number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 until April 30th , 2020, is demonstrated for
four exemplary countries: Belgium, Brazil, UK, and USA, representing three distinct continents. After an

followed by UK, Brazil, and Belgium. For Belgium, UK, and USA, countries with a large number of infected
individuals, the power-law growth gave place to a distinct behavior when approaching saturation. Brazil is
still in the power-law regime. Such updates of the data and projections corroborate recent results regarding
the power-law growth of the cumulative number of infected individuals by the new coronavirus and its strong
correlation between different countries around the world [11].
Furthermore, we study a variation of the well known SEIR epidemic model [15, 31] for predictions using
(or not) distinct government strategies applied on three distinct dates, namely April 16th (early action),
April 30th (current action), and May 14th (late action). The main goal is to show that time is one of the
most relevant weapons we have in the battle against the COVID-19. It has been shown recently that there
is a short time window for which it is possible to avoid the spread of the epidemic [32]. In our case, in
the three days mentioned above, we applied two strategies: (i) distinct degrees of social distance (vary θ),
and (ii) distinct degrees of identification of asymptomatic individuals (vary κa ). In the first strategy, we
change the values of θ from 0.5 to 2.5, meaning strong and essentially no social distance containments,
respectively. In the second strategy, we change κa from 0.1 to 1.0. This can be interpreted as identifying
daily 10% of all asymptomatic individuals when κa = 0.1. The ideal case is represented using κa = 1.0,
when all asymptomatic infected people are identified each day. Results for all countries convince us that
non-pharmacological strategies must be applied as soon as possible. These include social distance and a
large number of testing and immediate isolation of asymptomatic infected individuals. Furthermore, time
delays in applying such strategies lead to an irreversible catastrophic number of infected people.
