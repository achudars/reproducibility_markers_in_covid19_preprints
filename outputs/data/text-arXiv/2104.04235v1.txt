Abstract

In late-2020, many countries around the world faced another surge in number of confirmed cases of COVID19, including United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil, United States, etc., which resulted in a large nationwide and
even worldwide wave. While there have been indications that precaution fatigue could be a key factor, no
scientific evidence has been provided so far. We used a stochastic metapopulation model with a hierarchical
structure and fitted the model to the positive cases in the US from the start of outbreak to the end of 2020.
We incorporated non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) into this model by assuming that the precaution
strength grows with positive cases and studied two types of pandemic fatigue. We found that people in most
states and in the whole US respond to the outbreak in a sublinear manner (with exponent k=0.5), while only
three states (Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey) have linear reaction (k=1). Case fatigue (decline in
people's vigilance to positive cases) is responsible for 58% of cases, while precaution fatigue (decay of
maximal fraction of vigilant group) accounts for 26% cases. If there were no pandemic fatigue (no case
fatigue and no precaution fatigue), total positive cases would have reduced by 68% on average. Our study
shows that pandemic fatigue is the major cause of the worsening situation of COVID-19 in United States.
Reduced vigilance is responsible for most positive cases, and higher mortality rate tends to push local people
to react to the outbreak faster and maintain vigilant for longer time.

As warned by researchers (1), the resurgence of COVID-19 happened around the world in late 2020 (2,3,4).
Some countries like Italy and Iran had a second wave earlier than most (5,6), while others such as United
States, United Kingdom and Canada experienced record-breaking cases (7). Take United States for
example, as of Dec 22, cases of the past two months already account for more than half (53%) of total cases
in the whole 2020. Even though there has been a significant decrease in COVID cases since 2021, it is
important to understand the mechanisms of the multiple waves and prevent potential shortages of
equipment, staff and beds in hospitals (8).
However, the principles behind the resurgence of COVID-19 remain a challenging problem. While many
studies on second wave focus on the optimal strategy for school opening or control measures (9,10),
compartment models with homogeneous mixing assumption, and other methods such as network and
spatial models usually explore the additional epidemic states (11,12) or the interaction structure (13) and
mostly overlook the resurgence. Although many public health experts have expressed their concerns that
pandemic fatigue could threaten global health and might be the reason of the surge (14,15,16), few studies
focused on quantifying its impact on the spread of coronavirus (17).
Here we adopted the hierarchical metapopulation model that has shown capable of characterizing recurrent
outbreaks and simulating real epidemics such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (18). We
incorporated into it a precaution strength that varies based on recent positive cases and decays with time

due to pandemic fatigue and used the cases in United States as an example to conduct our modeling study.
We examined the mechanisms of the COVID-19 resurgence, and the explanations for its increasing
epidemic size. We explored the situations without pandemic fatigue, hoping to provide insights for
precaution strategy.

We fitted our model to the whole curve of daily positive cases of 22 states and the whole US cases between
March 4th and December 22nd, 2020, 7-day moving average is used to filter out the noise. Here we showed
the results of US and its five states and put the rest in the Supplementary Appendix. We ran 5000 trials
using hyperparameter optimization algorithm to find the optimal parameters. We found that the optimal
memory length and speed of response 𝑘𝑘 found by optimization algorithm are correlated with death rate in
each state (Figure S1 in Supplementary Appendix), indicating that people in places with higher mortality
rate tend to react faster, and remember older outbreak(s) thus take NPIs for a longer time. As a result, there
are fewer waves in New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts where mortality rate is much higher than the
rest. We also found that there's a strong negative correlation between the time-varying reproduction number
and the fraction of vigilant group. This relation is true for all data sets (the rest in Supplementary
Appendix), and they even have close identical slopes with slightly different intercepts. This indicates that
the fraction of individuals taking NPIs controls the reproduction number and determines specific features of
the outbreak, including the size and number of waves.

(circles) in this example, and within each context the mean field assumption holds true. An individual travels from

𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

−

context 𝑖𝑖 to 𝑗𝑗 with probability 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∝ 𝑒𝑒 𝜉𝜉 , where 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the ultra-metric distance between contexts 𝑖𝑖 and 𝑗𝑗 and 𝜉𝜉 is a
tunable parameter. 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is defined as the lowest level the subpopulations 𝑖𝑖 and 𝑗𝑗 share. For example, here 𝑑𝑑12 =
1, 𝑑𝑑24 = 𝑑𝑑68 = 2. (B) Dynamic reproduction number against fraction of vigilant group for six example data sets: the
whole United States, Arizona, Georgia, Massachusetts, Oregon and Texas states. (C) Relative epidemic size of 100
model simulations over real data.

As Figure 1 shows, the epidemic size generated from our model is close to the real case, since most boxes
are centered around a relative ratio of 1. Even the single simulation of Oregon State with the largest ratio of
1.44 only has an epidemic size of 3.5%, leaving 96.5% of uninfected population. The ratio distributions for
the remaining are all within the range of [0.4, 1.5] (Figure S3 in Supplementary Appendix). Because of the
relatively close size, our model can simulate a complete estimated dynamical process and predict a longterm run of coronavirus outbreak with higher reliability, in contrary to traditional epidemic models in
which the simulated size is usually much larger than real scenario and the pandemic dies down fast mostly
due to the depletion of susceptible individuals.
Due to the stochasticity of this model, we ran 100 simulations for each optimal parameter setting. We found
that 𝑘𝑘 = 1 is true only for Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey States, and 𝑘𝑘 = 0.5 for the remaining.
This means that only these three states react to COVID-19 in a linear manner, while the response of others
is much slower. Figure 2 shows the small variations in different runs, while the average is quite close to the
real case. The largest relative fitting error (New York in appendix) is 40%, while the smallest (the whole
US) is 11%. It is obvious that the states with longer memory have smoother variations of vigilant group,
such as Massachusetts State with a 170-day memory. The long-haul fight against the coronavirus directly
leads to the absence of a second wave around August in these states, reducing potentially a considerable
amount of COVID cases. The growth in vigilant group is always several weeks later than positive cases
because of the averaging and sublinear response in many states. It is worth noticing that the vigilance
fraction 𝑣𝑣(𝑡𝑡) already increased to nearly its maximal value 𝑓𝑓(𝑡𝑡) in response to the first and smallest
outbreak, however due to case fatigue, a 10 times larger follow-up wave cannot even alarm an equal
number of people! This indicates that case fatigue probably takes most responsibility for the recordbreaking coronavirus wave in the US in late 2020.

confidence interval (CI). The bottom panels are the time-varying reproduction number and the vigilance fraction 𝑝𝑝(𝑡𝑡)
with their 99% CIs.

In Figures S7 and S9, we showed that our model has some good predictive power: when predicting the
cases of following 15 days, its smallest error (the whole US) is merely 3.8%, while the largest (Wyoming)
is 56% and the average error is 23%. For predicting a longer future like the next 30 days, our model has a

larger average error of 75%. However, our prediction of the time of future outbreaks is still satisfactory,
which could provide valuable warning for potential waves.

To study the impact of pandemic fatigue on the spread of coronavirus, we explored the situations where
memory length is longer and precaution fatigue (decay in maximal vigilance fraction 𝑓𝑓(𝑡𝑡)) or case fatigue
(decline in case-sensitivity 𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡)) is smaller and even absent. Surprisingly, we found that the extension of
memory would not lead to a decline in epidemic size; on the contrary, it generated an increase in affected
number of individuals when memory length was larger enough to be considered as unlimited (see Figure 3
(G)). This indicated that longer memory is not always good-- when people remember waves long time ago,
averaging effect tend to make them think the upcoming wave is nothing terrible.
Nonetheless, we found both precaution and case fatigue are major reasons of the exceptionally large size of
COVID-19. With the increase of both lower bounds 𝑙𝑙𝑓𝑓 and 𝑙𝑙𝑐𝑐 , final epidemic size declined quite fast,
especially those data sets with extremely small original values, e.g., Arizona State in Figure 3 (I). Figure 3
(J) also showed that when there was no pandemic fatigue (𝑙𝑙𝑓𝑓 = 𝑙𝑙𝑐𝑐 = 1), five out of six data sets would have
a more than 70% decrease in epidemic size. In Figure 3 (A-F) we can see that all data sets would have had
a much smaller outbreak if there were no decay in precaution strength, and the occurrence of COVID
fatigue is distinct in each scenario. In fact, of all 23 data sets used in this study, pandemic fatigue accounts
for 68% of total coronavirus cases on average. This indicates that COVID fatigue is the largest cause of the
worsening coronavirus situation in late 2020.

We incorporated NPIs into a hierarchical metapopulation model and considered two types of pandemic
fatigue: precaution and case fatigue. Using United States for example, we obtained fairly good fits of the
whole curve of positive cases between March and December 2020. We also found that the model could
predict the cases of several states in the next 15 days with good accuracy, and even though it overestimated
the cases in the next 30 days for some states, it was still able to predict the right timing of the upcoming
wave, providing valuable warnings for a long time ahead.
We found that the estimated reproduction number had a perfect negative correlation with the fraction of
individuals seeking to take NPIs. Although some states had different intercepts, they all had close slopes in
this correlation, meaning the variation in vigilant group had similar impact in each case. This finding
suggested that one effective control measure is to encourage people to take precaution measures. The
decline of early waves was caused by stronger precaution measures, and we found that the emergence of
larger follow-up waves originated from the decrease in vigilant group and decay in vigilance level, which
we interpreted as two signs of pandemic fatigue.
While other research focused on the fatigue of policy makers and health workers (19,20), our study
explored civilian-level COVID fatigue and suggested it is one of the major reasons behind the resurgence
of coronavirus. Although there has been significant decrease in COVID-19 cases since 2021 due to
effective preventive interventions such as vaccines, pandemic fatigue will only intensify in the near future
hence needs our attention to prevent potential resurgence.
However, there are some limitations to our model analysis. We assumed that the precaution strength only
decreases with time in the long-term, while there could be some temporary increase in the interim due to
stronger policies or higher productivity. For example, in many places personal protective equipment (PPE)
such as facemask, respirator and hand sanitizer were in extreme shortage during the early outbreak; but as
manufacturers continued to produce the equipment, more and more people gained access to PPE which
might result in a quick decrease in cases and a long period with the disease under control. This could
possibly be one major reason that our model fitted the cases in New York and New Jersey states with much
higher error than others.
Our model focused on the effect of NPIs in analysis of COVID-19, but didn't explore the impact of travel
restrictions. One of the major advantages of hierarchical metapopulation model is its contexts located in a
hierarchical structure with travelers to spread the disease from one to another, while mean-field assumption
is true within each subpopulation. This indicates that one possible strategy to control the spread of
pandemic influenza is to impose travel ban and keep the epidemic local. When most infected or susceptible
individuals got into the recovered state, the disease simply dies down. We merely used constant values for
both the number of expected infected travelers 𝑃𝑃0 and travel distance tendency 𝜉𝜉 due to high complexity,
however, there are likely to be better implementations of the model with higher efficiency or just more
computing power that might make it possible to study time-varying travel parameters.
Even though our model could fit the real cases well, we used only three states (susceptible, infected,
recovered) for the transmission model. There have been many studies using SEIR model or even more
compartments (21,22,11) and showed that their epidemic models can also have good fits. This suggests that
more compartments are worth trying if our model failed to fit more complicated curves of future cases.
In conclusion, our results show that COVID fatigue is a major reason behind the resurgence in coronavirus
cases. In order to prevent another outbreak of COVID-19 cases, we need to maintain vigilant and overcome
pandemic fatigue. This long-term war against SARS-CoV-2 is not over yet, we can never let our guard
down.

Methods

Transmission model and precaution with fatigue are the two main components of our model. We used SIR
model with a hierarchical structure as the transmission model, assuming that homogeneous mixing is true
withing each subpopulation, and individuals travel between contexts with a probability correlated with their
distance. We introduced a precaution strength that is only related to recent positive cases due to
underestimation of the disease, and gradually decays with time because of COVID fatigue. We studied
pandemic fatigue through caution and case fatigue, representing the decline in number of vigilant people
and individuals becoming numb to new confirmed cases. In order to test the predictive power of our model,
we partitioned the real cases into training set and test set, and ran 5000 trials to find the best fit on the
training data.
Transmission model
To consider the spatial spread of COVID-19, we used a stochastic metapopulation model with
subpopulations distributed in a hierarchical structure (18). Each subpopulation equally consists of 𝑛𝑛
individuals, while the branching ratio 𝑏𝑏 and total depth 𝑙𝑙 together decide the number of groups (𝑏𝑏 𝑙𝑙 ).
Therefore, the total population of this model is 𝑁𝑁 = 𝑏𝑏 𝑙𝑙 × 𝑛𝑛. Figure 1 (A) shows an example of the
hierarchical structure.

All individuals except for one start as susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the one initial infected
case is assigned to a random subpopulation. Within each local context, compartment model (SIR) with
transmission rate 𝛽𝛽 and recovery rate 𝛾𝛾 is adopted. At each timestep, each individual travels from context 𝑖𝑖
−

𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗

with probability 𝑝𝑝 and enters a new context 𝑗𝑗 with probability 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∝ 𝑒𝑒 𝜉𝜉 , where 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the ultra-metric
distance between contexts 𝑖𝑖 and 𝑗𝑗, while 𝜉𝜉 is a tunable parameter that controls the tendency of long-distance
traveling. Defined as the expected number of infected individuals leaving a single context over the mean
infectious period, 𝑃𝑃0 basically controls how many potential spreaders there are and it has been shown by
Watts et al. (18) that 𝑃𝑃0 ≈ 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝′𝑛𝑛/𝛾𝛾, where 𝜓𝜓′ is the expected normalized epidemic size for a compartment
model with reproduction number 𝑅𝑅0 . In our model we used 𝛽𝛽 = 0.65, 𝛾𝛾 = 0.2, 𝑏𝑏 = 6, 𝑙𝑙 = 5, 𝑛𝑛 = 100
which constitute a total of 777600 individuals for all data set. Through our experiments we found that 𝑏𝑏 and
𝑙𝑙 need to be large enough when fitting complicated spreading process of infectious disease and showed in
the results that our parameter settings enabled our model to simulate any scenario we encountered.
Precaution with fatigue
In order to incorporate the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and COVID fatigue into this model, we
considered a group of vigilant individuals that seek to take precaution measures based on recent confirmed
COVID-19 cases, and assumed there are two types of fatigue, of which the first one is precaution fatigue
denoting less vigilant people and the second is case fatigue meaning lower vigilance level to new cases. We
defined the vigilant group below
𝑣𝑣(𝑡𝑡) = 𝑓𝑓(𝑡𝑡) min ��𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡)

𝑘𝑘

∑𝑡𝑡𝜏𝜏=𝑡𝑡−(𝑚𝑚−1) 𝐼𝐼 (̇ 𝜏𝜏)
� , 1�
𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚

where 𝑓𝑓(𝑡𝑡) represents the maximal fraction of vigilant group at time 𝑡𝑡, 𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡)is the case-sensitive factor at
time 𝑡𝑡, 𝐼𝐼 (̇ 𝑡𝑡) is the new positive cases at time 𝑡𝑡 and 𝑘𝑘 controls how fast people react to new cases (sublinear,
linear or superlinear). Since interventions are usually adjusted regarding the epidemic situations over a
period, we used the average of new cases for 𝑚𝑚 time steps to manage the intervention strength, where 𝑚𝑚
represents the memory length. When there’s an outbreak, the surge in 𝐼𝐼 ̇(𝑡𝑡) will lead to an increase in 𝑣𝑣(𝑡𝑡),
i.e., more people taking NPIs which makes the disease harder to spread. As the epidemic eases people start
to let their guards down and this is usually when a second wave attacks. It's obvious that if 𝑓𝑓(𝑡𝑡) and 𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡)
decline, there will be less vigilant people and they will become less sensitive to positive cases, leading to
fierce resurgence of cases. Therefore, 𝑓𝑓(𝑡𝑡) corresponds to precaution fatigue while 𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡) shows case fatigue.

We used reverse sigmoid functions both for 𝑓𝑓(𝑡𝑡) and 𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡) to emulate the phenomenon where fatigue
permeates slowly
𝑓𝑓(𝑡𝑡) = 𝑓𝑓(0)
𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡) = 𝑐𝑐(0)

where 𝑙𝑙𝑓𝑓 and 𝑙𝑙𝑐𝑐 are the relative lower bounds of 𝑓𝑓(𝑡𝑡) and 𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡), 𝑢𝑢𝑓𝑓 , 𝑢𝑢𝑐𝑐 and 𝑠𝑠𝑓𝑓 , 𝑠𝑠𝑐𝑐 controls when and how fast
these functions decay. In our model, pandemic fatigue (the decline in 𝑓𝑓(𝑡𝑡) and 𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡)) is a major reason of
the recent surge in cases. We showed the curves of 𝑓𝑓(𝑡𝑡) and 𝑐𝑐(𝑡𝑡) for each data set in Figure S4 in
Supplementary Appendix.
Based on the paper by Eksin et al. (23), we assumed that the same fraction of both susceptible and infected
individuals belongs to the vigilant group and take NPIs, and all of them cannot infect or get infected from
others. Therefore, the dynamics become

Data sources

Since we used United States for an example in our modeling study, we fitted a stochastic transmission
dynamic model to multiple publicly available data sets of positive cases in 22 states and the whole US. The
data we used is from "The COVID Tracking Project" https://covidtracking.com/ and is open to public. The
reason that we only used data of 22 states instead of all 50 in the United States is due to the incompleteness
of the remaining data, considering we focused on the time period between March 4th, 2020 and December
22nd, 2020.

Data
The COVID-19 data sets we used were from "The COVID Tracking Project" (1), the population data we
used was from World Population Review (2), we used positive cases and death cases from this data set (3)
Loss function
For model fitting and prediction, we used a commonly used hyperparameter optimization algorithm
named Hyperopt (4) to find the optimal parameters. We defined a simple loss function as the relative
absolute error

where 𝑇 is the total length of data, 𝑌 is the actual number of cases at time 𝑡, 𝑌 is the predicted number of
cases at time 𝑡, 𝑌 represents the number of model cases at time 𝑡, 𝓅 denotes the population of the data set
and 𝑁 is the total number of individuals in the model. Since we fixed the hierarchy structure, during
optimization we fitted the normalized data (cases/population), after we found the optimal parameters we

adjusted the predicted cases by multiplying a constant .
Hyperparameter space
For the expected number of infected travelers 𝑃 and long-distance travel tendency 𝜉, we used a suitable
range to make sure the spreading speed and final epidemic size are both in a proper scope. It's worth
noting that we set the range of 𝜉 as [0ꞏ4, 0ꞏ5], with the upper bound a little lower than the theoretical
value

0ꞏ558 that assumes people travel to all distances with equal likelihood (4), which is nearly

impossible in real life. The lower bound of 𝜉 is to make sure there’s an outbreak.

Table S5
Loss and prediction error. It is worth noticing that fitting loss and fitting error are calculated in the same way, they
are different because we used 100 simulations for the fitting error and only 1 simulation when fitting to obtain the
results faster. The loss of prediction is the relative error on training data and error of prediction is for the test data.
