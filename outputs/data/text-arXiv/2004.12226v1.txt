Abstract—The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak is drastically shaping and reshaping many aspects of our
life, with a huge impact on our social life. In this era of lockdown
policies in most of the major cities around the world, we see a
huge increase in people and professionals’ engagement in social
media. Social media is playing an important role in news propagation as well as keeping people in contact. At the same time, this
source is both a blessing and a curse as the coronavirus infodemic
has become a major concern, and is already a topic that needs
special attention and further research. In this paper, we provide
a multilingual coronavirus (COVID-19) Instagram dataset that
we have been continuously collected since March 30, 2020. We
are making our dataset available to the research community at
https://github.com/kooshazarei/COVID-19-InstaPostIDs. We believe that this contribution will help the community to better
understand the dynamics behind this phenomenon in Instagram,
as one of the major social media. This dataset could also help
study the propagation of misinformation related to this outbreak.
Index Terms—Coronavirus; COVID-19; Instagram, Social Network Analysis; Dataset.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 11 March
2020.1 Since then the world has experienced almost 3 million
cases. To mitigate its spread, many government have therefore
imposed unprecedented social distancing measures that have
led to millions become housebound. This has resulted in a
flurry of research activity surrounding both understanding and
countering the outbreak [1].
As part of this, social media has become a vital tool
in disseminating public health information and maintaining
connectivity amongst people. Several recent studies have relied
on Twitter data to better understand this [2]–[5]. These have
primarily focused on health related (mis)information, but there
have also been studies into online hate [6]. Despite this, there
has been only limited exploration of other social modalities,
such as image content.
We argue this represents a limitation, particularly considering the importance of image-based content in the dissemination of news (and misinformation) [7], [8]. This paper
introduces a COVID-19 Instagram dataset, which we make
available for the research community. We have gathered data
between January 5 and March 30 2020 (§III). The dataset
covers 18.5K comments and 329K likes from 5.3K posts.
These posts have been distributed by 2.5K publishers. The data
1 https://tinyurl.com/WHOPandemicAnnouncement

predominantly covers English language posts, and we provide
a number of important features covering both the content and
the publisher (§IV). We hope that this dataset can help support
a number of use cases. Hence, we conclude the paper by
highlighting a number of potential uses related to COVID19 social media analysis (§V). Details of how to access the
data is presented in §VI.
II. R ELATED W ORK
Most related to this work is the set of COVID-19 social
media datasets recently released. To date, this predominantly
covered textual data (e.g. Twitter). To assist in this, Kazemi
et al. [9] provide a toolbox for processing textual data related
to COVID-19. In terms of data, the first efforts in this
direction was from authors in [2] which provide a large Twitter
dataset related to Coronavirus (by crawling major hashtags and
trusted accounts). Another similar study [3], provides an arabic
Twitter dataset with a similar data collection methodology.
Lopez et al. [4] provide another Twitter dataset including the
geolocated tweets. There are some further efforts on providing
similar datasets from twitter [10]–[12]. Sharma et al. [5] also
made a public dashboard2 available summarising data across
more than 5 million real-time tweets.
These Twitter datasets are being used for various use
cases. For example, Saire and Navarro [13] use the data
to show the epidemiological impact of COVID-19 on press
publications. Singh et al. [14] are also monitoring the flow of
(mis)information flow across 2.7M tweets, and correlating it
with infection rates to find that misinformation and myths are
discussed, but at lower volume than other conversations. To
the best of our knowledge, the only paper that has covered
Instagram is by Cinelli et al. [15], who analyse Twitter,
Instagram, YouTube, Reddit and Gab data about COVID-19.
We complement this by making a public Instagram dataset
available to the community. We redirect readers to [1] for a
comprehensive survey of ongoing data science research related
to COVID-19.
III. DATA C OLLECTION
We have collected public posts from Instagram by crawling
all posts associated with a set of COVID-19 hashtags presented
in Table I.
Methodology. To be able to collect Instagram public content
(in the shape of post), we use the official Instagram APIs
2 https://usc-melady.github.io/COVID-19-Tweet-Analysis/

[16]. In particular, to get posts that are tagged with specific
hashtags, the Instagram Hashtag Engine is used [17]. This API
returns public photos and videos that have been tagged with
particular hashtags. MongoDB is used as the core database and
data is stored as JSON records. The crawler is responsible for
gathering both posts and reactions. A reaction can be active
(comment) or passive (like). As it is infeasible to collect all
reactions, in this dataset, we define a limitat of 500 comments
and 500 likes per post. Our crawler is running on several
virtual machines in parallel 24/7. Note that we do not manually
filter any posts and therefore we gather all posts containing the
hashtags, regardless of the specific topics discussed within.
The complete architecture of our crawler is described in this
paper [18].
Release v1.0 (April 20, 2020). The first version of this data
collection process started on January 5, 2020 and continued
until March 30, 2020. The data gathering is still running as
the lockdown has not been finished in many countries around
the world (at the time of writing this paper). During this time
18.5K comments and 329K likes from 5.3K public posts have
been collected. These posts are distributed by 2.5K publishers.
Ethics. In line with Instagram policies as well as user privacy,
we only gather publicly available data that is obtainable from
Instagram.
IV. DATASET D ESCRIPTION
To provide context for potential users of our dataset, we next
brifely summarise the dataset and describe the characteristics
of the content.
Hashtags. Recall that we gather the data by querying certain
hashtags. Figure 2 presents the top hashtags tagged within
the posts. Figure 1 also presents a wordcloud of the hashtags
in our dataset. This naturally includes hashtags outside of
our seed set used for crawling. There are intuitive examples,
such as corona, covid19, covid 19, stayathome, quarantine,
love, covid, virus, and instagram. The are therefore the most
repeated hashtags that appear with #coronavirus. Note that this
means will might miss posts that mention these concepts in
other languages.

Fig. 2: Bar plot of the 25 most used hashtags.
Post Language. In order to identify the language of the post,
we use spaCy library [19] and we apply it on the text of
the caption. The language distribution is displayed in Table II.
The dataset is dominated by English language content, making
up almost 60% of posts. This is driven by our choice of an
English-language hashtag seed set used for data collection.
That said, we have broad coverage of other widely spoken
languages too, e.g. Spanish (9.9%). Notice that there is no
official metric to determine the post language. Therefore, we
highlight that this analysis could mis-classify certain posts,
such as those solely hashtags or emojis.

Features. To keep data organized, the dataset is divided
into four parts: (i) post content, (ii) publisher information,
(iii) comment metrics, and (iv) like features (Table III). Posts
contain key attributes such as a caption, list of hashtags,
image/video, number of likes, number of comments, location,
date, tagged list, etc. A post is published by a public account
(or public Instagram page) and in our dataset, it can be
individual, fan page, news agency, influencer, blogger, etc.
Each post receives reactions in the form of comment and like
that are issued by the audience/followers. The full feature list
is presented in Table III. Furthermore, Table IV presents Post
and Profile characteristics in detail.

1) Fake news, misinformation and rumors spreading:.
Several researcher have
started
to
inspect
COVID-19 misinformation. As an example, an
infodemic observatory have analyzed more than
100M public messages to understand the digital
response in online social media to COVID-19
outbreak.https://covid19obs.fbk.eu In another study,
Sharma et al. [5] made a public dashboard available
summarising data from real-time tweets in in
https://usc-melady.github.io/COVID-19-Tweet-Analysis/
with a focus to misinformation spread analysis. We
believe that our Instagram data could be used to
evaluate the flow of misinformation (e.g. memes) on
Instagram.
2) Bot Population and bot generated content: It is well
known that bot content plays a prominent role in social
media data [20]. These have the capacity of amplify
misinformation or even act against public health policies
(e.g. encourgaging a breakdown in social distancing).
We posit that the data could be used to explore the role
of bots in this dissemination.
3) Behavioral change analysis during the pandemic: The
social distancing measures are created an unprecedented
change to millions of people’s lives. Understanding the
behavioral consequences of this is vital for understanding things like adherence to social distancing policies
and mental health consequences.
4) Information sharing related Covid-19: Information flow
is vital during periods of emergency. We posit that the
dataset can be used to understand the flow of information, as well as people’s reactions to such information.

VI. DATASET ACCESS
The
presented
dataset
is
accessible
in
this
address
on
Github
platform:
https://github.com/kooshazarei/COVID-19-InstaPostIDs.
This is the first version of the dataset and we are still
collecting data. Hence, we hope to make further versions
available in the coming weeks and months. We publish this
dataset in agreement with Instagram’s Terms & Conditions
[21], and as it is not possible to release the post content and
reactions, we just distribute the post ID’s. These are known
as the shortcodes. Researchers can then simply retrieve post
content through IDs by the help of some open-source projects
such as Instaloader [22] that have been developed for such
purposes. For any further question, please contact Koosha
