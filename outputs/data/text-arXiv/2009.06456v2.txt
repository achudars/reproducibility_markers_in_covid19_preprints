Abstract— Scarcity of annotated images hampers the
building of automated solution for reliable COVID-19 diagnosis and evaluation from CT. To alleviate the burden of
data annotation, we herein present a label-free approach for
segmenting COVID-19 lesions in CT via pixel-level anomaly
modeling that mines out the relevant knowledge from normal CT lung scans. Our modeling is inspired by the observation that the parts of tracheae and vessels, which lay in
the high-intensity range where lesions belong to, exhibit
strong patterns. To facilitate the learning of such patterns at
a pixel level, we synthesize ‘lesions’ using a set of surprisingly simple operations and insert the synthesized ‘lesions’
into normal CT lung scans to form training pairs, from
which we learn a normalcy-converting network (NormNet)
that turns an ’abnormal’ image back to normal. Our experiments on two different datasets validate the effectiveness
of NormNet, which conspicuously outperforms a variety of
unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) methods.

HE world has been facing a global pandemic caused by a
novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) since December
2019 [1], [2]. According to the report from World Health
Organization, COVID-19 has infected over 20 millions people
including more than half a million deaths up to August
10 [3]. In clinics, real-time reverse-transcriptionpolymerasechainreaction (RT-PCR) is the golden standard to make a
definite diagnosis of COVID-19 infection [4]. However, due
to the high false-negative rate [5], [6] and the shortage of
equipment of RT-PCR, the radiological imaging techniques,
e.g., x-ray and computed tomography (CT) still play a key
role in COVID-19 diagnosis and evaluation [2], [7].
Compared to x-ray, CT screening is proved more effective
due to its high spatial resolution and the unique relationship
between CT density and lung air content [8]–[11]. For COVID19 evaluation, segmentation of the infection lesions from CT
scans is crucial for quantitative measurement and follow-up
assessment [12], [13]. As it is time-consuming for experts
to go through the 3D volumes slice by slice, automatic
segmentation is highly desirable in clinical practice [2], [14].

Recently, deep learning based methods have been proposed for
COVID-19 lesion screening [2] and some of them are proved
successful for COVID-19 segmentation [12]–[14].
Despite such success, they all rely on large-scale welllabeled datasets. However, obtaining such datasets is very
difficult due to two related concerns. On the one hand, labeling
a 3D CT volume is costly and time-consuming. Often it
needs experienced radiologists, who are busy fighting the
COVID-19 pandemic and hence lack time for lesion labeling.
On the other hand, the COVID-19 lesions not only have a
variety of complex appearances such as Ground-Glass Opacity
(GGO), reticulation, and consolidation [15], but also have high
variations in texture, size, and position. Those diversities raise
a greater demand for rich annotated datasets. Accordingly,
large-scale well-labeled COVID-19 datasets are scarce, which
limits the use of Artificial Intelligent (AI) to help fight against
COVID-19. As reported in Table I, most of the public COVID19 datasets focus on diagnosis which only have classification
information, while only a few of them provide semantic segmentation labels. While research attempts [16]–[18] have been
made to address the challenges, these works, nevertheless, still
need annotated images for training purpose. In this paper, we
present a label-free approach, requiring no lesion annotation.
Although it is very difficult to build a large well-labeled
COVID-19 dataset, collecting a large-scale normal CT volume
dataset is much easier. It is also interesting to notice that the
patterns of normal lungs are regular and easy to be modeled.
The thorax of a normal person consists of large areas of air and
a few tissues (such as tracheae and vessels [8]), which can be
clearly distinguished by CT intensity [8]. As shown in Fig. 1,
the air region is usually displayed as black background, with

its Hounsfield unit (HU) value around -1000 [8]. Meanwhile,
the tissue (with its HU > −500 [8]) has its intensity values
similar to those of lesions, but it exhibits a regular pattern,
which makes it amenable for modeling say by a deep network.
This fact motivates us to formulate lesion segmentation as a
pixel-level anomaly modeling problem. We hypothesize that
if all the normal signals are captured at a pixel level, then the
remaining abnormal pixels are localized automatically, which
are grouped together as lesions.
To facilitate pixel-level anomaly modeling, we propose to
synthesize ‘lesions’ and insert them into normal CT images,
forming pairs of normal and ‘abnormal’ images for training.
Surprisingly, such ‘lesion’ synthesis procedure constitutes a
few simple operations, such as random shape generation,
random noise generation within the shape and traditional
filtering. Using these training pairs, we train a deep imageto-image network such as 3D U-Net [31] that converts an
‘abnormal’ image into normal. We call our network as a
normalcy-converting network (NormNet). The NormNet essentially learns a decision boundary between normal tissues
(particularly the tissues in a high intensity range) and synthetic
‘lesions’. We validate the effectiveness of NormNet on two
different datasets. Empirically, it clearly outperforms various
competing label-free approaches and its performances are even
comparable to those of supervised method by some metrics.
It should be noted that our approach differs from a research
line called unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) [32]–[36],
which aims to detect the out-of-distribution (OOD) data by
memorizing and integrating anomaly-free training data and
has been successfully applied in many image-level holistic
classification scenarios. However, when applying the UAD
methods for pixel-level image segmentation, their performances are rather limited [35], which we will confirm in our
experiments. Further, our method differs from those methods
in the inpainting [37] task, whose images in both training and
testing sets are contaminated by the masks (noises) from the
same domain. Finally, our method is different from synthetic
data augmentation [38], which manually generates images
according to the labeled lesion area. In contrast, we do not
need any image with labeled COVID-19 lesions.
In summary, we make the following contributions:
• We propose the NormNet, a pixel-level anomaly mod-

eling network, to distinguish the COVID-19 lesion from
healthy tissues in the thorax area. This training procedure
only needs a large-scale healthy CT lung dataset, without
any labeled COVID-19 CT volume.
We design an effective strategy for generating synthetic
‘lesions’ using surprisingly simple operations such as
random shape, noise generation, and image filtering.
The experiments show that our NormNet achieves better
performances than various competing label-free methods
on two different COVID-19 datasets.
II. R ELATED W ORK

A. COVID-19 screening and segmentation for chest CT
Deep learning based methods for chest CT greatly help
COVID-19 diagnosis and evaluation [2], [7]. Wang et al. [39]
propose a weakly-supervised framework for COVID-19 classification at the beginning of the pandemic, which achieves high
performance. Wang et al. [40] exploit prior-attention residual learning for more discriminative COVID-19 diagnosis.
Ouyang et al. [41] solve the imbalanced problem of COVID19 diagnosis by a dual-sampling attention network. However,
it is more difficult for the COVID-19 segmentation task due to
the lack of well-labeled data [18], lesion diversities [15] and
noisy labels [17]. Researchers have made attempts to address
the above challenges. For example, to tackle the problem of
labeled data scarcity, Ma et al. [28] annotate 20 CT volumes
from coronacases [27] and radiopedia [26]. Fan et al. [18]
propose a semi-supervised framework called Inf-Net. Zhou et
al. [16] solve the same issue by fitting the dynamic change of
real patients data measured at different time points. However,
all of these models depend on data with semantic labels. In this
work, we propose an unsupervised anomaly modeling method
called NormNet, which achieves comparable performances,
but with no need of labeled data.
B. Anomaly detection
Anomaly detection or outlier detection is a lasting yet
active research area in machine learning [42], which is a key
technique to overcome the data bottleneck [43]. A natural
choice for handling this problem is one-class classification
methods, such as OC-SVM [44], SVDD [45], Deep SVDD
[46] and 1-NN. These methods detect anomaly by clustering
a discriminate hyper-lane surrounding the normal samples in
the embedding space.
However, these methods can only detect anomaly in imagelevel. In medical imaging analysis, it is also important to find
the abnormal area [43], [47]. Recently, CNN-based generative
models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) [48],
and Variational Auto-encoders (VAE) [49] are proved essential
for unsupervised anomaly segmentation [50]. These methods
first capture the normal distribution by learning a mapping
between the normal data and a low-dimensional latent space
by reconstruction loss. They assume that if this process is
only trained with normal distributions, a lesion area with
abnormal shape and context can not be correctly mapped and
reconstructed, resulting in high reconstruction error, which
helps to localize the lesion area. The f-AnoGAN method [50],

[51] learns the projection by solving an optimization problem,
while VAE [49] tackles the same problem by penalizing
the evidence lower bound (ELBO). Several extensions such
as context encoder [52], constrained VAE [53], adversarial
autoencoder [53], GMVAE [54], Bayesian VAE [55] and
anoVAEGAN [56] improve the accuracy of the projection.
Based on the pretrained projection, You et al. [54] restore
the lesion area by involving an optimization on the latent
manifold, while Zimmerer et al. [43] locate the anomaly with
a term derived from the Kullback-Leibler (KL)-divergence.
Despite the success of these methods for the classification
tasks [57], [58], their segmentation performances are insufficient [35]. The assumptions used by those reconstructionbased methods are shown to be problematic [34], [59]. Firstly,
the calibrated likelihoods of the decoder may not be precise
enough [60]. The out-of-distribution data have some possibilities to be successfully reconstructed [61], which raises falsenegatives. Furthermore, the reconstruction is far from perfect
[60], [62]. The decoder can not reconstruct all of the details
of normal data precisely, which may cause false positives. As
a result, these anomaly segmentation methods have limited
segmentation performance, as indicated in the brain tumor
segmentation task [35]. Moreover, specifically in lung CT, as
some of the tissues are very small and appear irregularly, their
information is easily lost during the down-sampling process of
the encoder [63], which causes more segmentation errors.
The design of our method is to alleviate such issues. Firstly,
we choose a 3D U-Net [31] as our encoder-decoder structure,
and use the skip connection of U-Net to alleviate the loss of
information. Next, to avoid inaccurate modeling, we generate
a segmentation map from the original healthy CT and compute
the loss based on it directly. At last, to encourage our NormNet
to learn a decision boundary for healthy signals, we use

synthetic lesions as anomalies.
III. M ETHOD
In this section, we firstly introduce the overall framework
of our NormNet. Then we illustrate how to generate diverse
‘lesions’ in the given lung mask. Finally, we clarify how to
post-process the lesion results predicted by our NormNet to
obtain the final lesion mask for an unseen test image.
A. Overall framework
Let {R1 , R2 , · · · , RT } be a set of T healthy lung CT
images. We clip the raw image Ri with an HU range of
[−800, 100] and scale the clipped image to [0, 1], obtaining
Ri0 . As shown in Fig. 2, our methods firstly use CNNbased lung segmentation method to obtain the lung masks
{M10 , M20 , · · · , MT0 } and the thorax areas {H10 , H20 , · · · , HT0 }
with Hi0 = Ri0
Mi0 , where
stands for pixel-wise multiplication. It is worth noting that because no segmentation
model can achieve 100% accuracy, and there are always some
edges caused by segmentation errors left in the thorax area
Hi0 , we introduce a simple pre-processing step (in Section IIIB) to remove erroneous edges and generate a new lung mask
Mi . Finally the thorax areas are updated to {H1 , H2 , · · · , HT }
with Hi = Hi0 Mi .
Then we use the synthetic ‘lesion’ generator described in
Section III-C to synthesize various ‘lesions’ B within the
lung masks Mi with diverse shapes G and textures, and
inject them into the thorax area Hi to form the input Ai .
Because the tissue patterns in the high-intensity range (say
HU≥ T with the threshold T = −500) in normal images are
rather distinguishable from that of lesions, we concentrate on

4

processing within this range and compute ground truth as
GTi = π(Hi ≥ τ )

(1 − G),

(1)

where π(.) is an indicator function that produces a binary
mask. Note that the value of τ in Hi is equivalent to the
HU threshold; for example, T = −500 means τ = 0.33. Our
NormNet is learned to predict the healthy part from Ai via
encouraging it to be close to GTi (aka minimizing Dice loss
and cross-entropy loss). In this procedure, our NormNet learns
to capture the context of healthy tissues quickly and precisely.
When our NormNet is applied to an unseen COVID-19 CT
volume, it recognizes the healthy part of the volume with
a high confidence and the lesion part of the volume with a
low confidence. The confidence scores thus can be used as
a decision boundary to predict the healthy parts and lesions.
Because our training process is random, we learn the 5 models
under the same setting to form an ensemble. A majority-vote
for healthy parts is conducted as the final prediction. As our
method is trained by the ground truth whose HU≥ T , a small
number of lesion pixels whose HU< T are not taken into
consideration and might get missed. So, we grow the localized
lesion areas to bring them back, following the post-processing
step in Section III-D.

with the radius of each ellipsoid randomly selected from
U [10, 32]; and (3) Generate a large size ellipsoid with a
probability of 0.2λ and with its radius ∼ U [32, 64].
• For each generated ellipsoid, deform it using elastic
transformation [64] with random parameters and rotate
it to align with random axes, yielding a blob C. Then
position this blob at a random center inside the lung Hi .
At this stage, we have a set of blobs {C1 , C2 , . . .}. Then
we merge connected blobs and obtain several non-adjacent
blobs {G1 , G2 , . . .} with varying shapes. For each blob Gj ,
we synthesize a patch of lesion Bj by the following steps.
2) Generating lesion-like textures: The texture pattern of
lesions varies; thus it is challenging to generate lesion-like
textures. Below we outline our attempt of doing so using a set
of simple operations. It should be noted that our method is far
from prefect; nevertheless, we find it is empirically effective.
We follow a series of three steps, namely noise generation, filtering, and scaling/clipping operations, to generate the
lesion-like textures.
• Noise generation. For each pixel denoted by x, generate
salt noise b1 (x)
b1 (x) =

B. Removing erroneous edges
As mentioned above, this step is to separate the wrong edges
caused by segmentation errors from lung mask Mi0 . For a pair
of inputs {Mi0 , Hi }, we select all the connected areas in thorax
area Hi with most of the pixels lying on the edges of the lung
segmentation mask Mi0 , and mark them as the wrong edges Ei .
To avoid injecting noise into those edges, we use the lung mask
without those edges, formulated as Mi = Mi0 − Ei . Note that
we only launch this process in the training phase, leveraging
the fact that no lesion occurs inside a healthy volume.
C. Synthetic ‘lesion’ generator
As shown in Fig. 3, the generator constitutes a set of simple
operations, following the two steps: (i) generating lesionlike shapes and (ii) generating lesion-like textures. Below, we
elaborate each step.
1) Generating lesion-like shapes: Multiple COVID-19 lesions may exist in a CT scan and they have various shapes.
To obtain multiple lesion-like shapes with a CT, we propose
the following pipeline. Below, U [a, b] denotes a uniform
probability within the range [a, b].
• For each lung mask Mi with a shape of size
Mi
as the
[32, 512, 512], compute a factor λ = max
j Mj
fraction of the lung mask Mi comparing to the one with
maximum volume. This factor controls the number of
ellipsoids being generated with a larger λ likely yielding
more ellipsoids.
• Create several ellipsoids as follows: (1) Sample a number Ns ∼ U [5λ, 10λ] and then generate Ns small-size
ellipsoids with the radius of each ellipsoid randomly
selected from U [3, 10]; (2) Sample a number Nm ∼
U [5λ, 10λ] and then generate Nm medium-size ellipsoids

where ⊗ is the standard image filtering operator. The

where µ0 ∼ U [0.4, 0.8] and meant (f (x)) is the mean
intensity of the image f (x) that passes the threshold t.
Now, we describe how to obtain the pixel-dependent probability function a(x), again using a series of noise generation,
filtering, and scaling operations.
• Noise generation. For each pixel x, independently sample
the uniform probability U [0, 1] to get a noise image
a1 (x) ∼ U [0, 1].
• Filtering. Filter the noise image a1 (x) to obtain a2 (x)
using a Gaussian filter g with a standard deviation σa .
a2 (x) = g(x; σa ) ⊗ a1 (x),
where the standard deviation σa ∼ U [2, 20].

Finally, we inject the synthetic lesions Bj into the various

lung area Hi . Mathematically, the image Ai with synthetic
‘lesions’ is generated by finding the maximum value of the
lung area Hi and the synthetic lesions Bj at each pixel point:
Ai = max(Hi , B1 , B2 , · · · ).

D. Post processing
A post processing procedure is designed to obtain the final
lesion prediction based on difference between the original CT
volume and predicted healthy areas. As illustrated in Fig. 4,
the final prediction is obtained with the following steps:
• Compute the lung mask (Fig. 4(b)) and predict the healthy
part by NormNet (Fig. 4(c));
• Compute the lesion region by subtracting the predicted
healthy part from lung mask to get Fig. 4(d). Considering
that only bright pixels ≥ τ are in the lung mask, the fullpixel raw lesion areas (Fig. 4(f)) is calculated, aiming to
‘recover’ less bright lesions;
• Mean filtering F with kernel size k is then applied to
Figs. 4(d) and 4(f) to smooth the lesion region and then
remove the background noise via thresholding, which
obtains the results in Fig. 4(e) and 4(g), respectively;

IV. E XPERIMENTS

Below we firstly provide a brief description of the various
CT lung datasets used in our experiments. Then we present
our experimental settings and the baseline approaches we implement and compare. Finally, we show our main experimental

6

results and an ablation study.
A. Datasets
One distinguishing feature of the paper lies in unleashing
the power embedded in existing datasets. Rather than using
a single dataset, we seamlessly integrate multiple CT lung
datasets for two different tasks of healthy lung modeling,
COVID-19 lesion segmentation, and general-purpose lung
segmentation into one working solution.
1) CT datasets for healthy lung modeling: LUNA16 [65] is
a grand-challenge on lung nodule analysis. The images are
collected from The Lung Image Database Consortium image
collection (LIDC-IDRI) [66], [67], [69], and each image is
labeled by 4 experienced radiologists. As half of the images
are healthy and clean except for those contain nodule areas,
we select 453 CT volumes from LUNA16 and remove the
slices with nodules to formulate our healthy lung CT dataset.
2) CT datasets for COVID-19 lesion segmentation : To measure the performance of our methods towards COVID-19 segmentation, we choose two public COVID-19 CT segmentation
datasets in the Table I with semantic labels. It is worth noting
that our method segments the COVID-19 lesions under the
unsupervised setting, and thus the labeled datasets are only
used for testing. All of the CT slices have been resized to
512 × 512.
• Coronacases: There are 10 public CT volumes in the [27]
uploaded from the patients diagnosed with COVID-19.
These volumes are firstly delineated by junior annotators1 , and then refined by two radiologists with 5 years
experience, and finally, all the annotations are verified and
refined by a senior radiologist with more than 10 years
experience in chest radiology diagnosis [28].
• Radiopedia: Another 8 axial volumetric CTs are released
from Radiopaedia [26] and have been evaluated by a
radiologist as positive and segmented [25].
3) CT datasets for general purpose lung segmentation :

To obtain the accurate lung area in the CT volume, we
choose nnU-Net [68] as our lung segmentation method, which
is proved to be state-of-the-art segmentation framework in
medical imaging analysis. We use two lung CT datasets with
semantic labels for the lung region:
• NSCLC left and right lung segmentation: This dataset
consists of lung volume segmentation collected on 402
CT scans from The Cancer Imaging Archive NSCLC
Radiomics [69]–[71].
• StructSeg lung organ segmentation: This dataset consists
of 50 lung cancer patient CT scans with lung organ
segmentation. The dataset served as a segmentation challenge during MICCAI 2019 [72].
• MSD Lung tumor segmentation This dataset consists of
63 labelled CT scans, which served as a segmentation
challenge during MICCAI 2018 [73]. The lung regions
are labeled by Ma et al. [28].
1 Ma et al. provide 20 well-labeled CT volumes, in addition to the 10
volumes of coronacases, the other 10 volumes have been clipped to [0 –
255] without any information about HU, which is not applicable based on
our methods.

We choose 2D U-Net as the backbone. The model is trained
by nnU-Net [68] in 5-fold cross-validation, which segments
the lung region very precisely with Dice scores larger than
0.98 in both Coronacases and Radiopedia datasets.
B. Experimental settings
1) Evaluation metrics: We use several metrics widely used
to measure the performance of segmentation models in medical imaging analysis, including precision score (PSC), sensitivity (SEN) and Dice coefficient (DSC), which are formulated
as follows:
tp
2tp
tp
; SEN =
; DSC =
,
P SC =
tp + f p
tp + f n
2tp + f n + f p

where tp, f p and f n refer to the true positive, false positive
and false negative respectively.
2) Pre-processing: All of the images in the training and
testing sets are segmented for the lung region at first. Then
we unify their spacing to 0.8 × 0.8 × 1mm3 , as well as
orientation. Next, all of the images are clipped with window
range [−800, 100] and normalized to [0, 1]. Finally, the lung
regions are centralized and padded to 512 × 512 with 0.
3) Training and inference details: We choose 3D U-Net [31]
as backbone for NormNet, implemented by MONAI2 . As all
of the volumes in both training and testing phases are well
aligned, no more augmentation is needed. The NormNet is
trained on a TITAN RTX GPU and optimized by the Adam
optimizer with default settings. We train our network for 3500
iterations with a batch size of 8, and set the learning rate
to 3e-4. For the testing phase, as the contexts of healthy
signals are precisely captured by our NormNet, these signals
are predicted with high probability. Therefore, we select those
pixels with probability > 0.95 as healthy parts in the COVID19 CT volume. For the mean filtering in the post processing,
we set kernel sizes f to 9, 7 and thresholds to 0.2, 0.15
for lesion parts with bright pixels (Fig. 4d) and full pixels
(Fig. 4f), respectively. We obtain these values according to the
hyperparameter search, which are fixed to all of two COVID19 datasets.
C. Baselines
We compare our methods with existing deep learning
based methods in medical imaging analysis for unsupervised
anomaly detection (UAD) methods to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. To eliminate the influence of irrelevant
factors, we use the images with only lung regions as training
and testing sets for all of the experiments (expect for VAE
Original). These encoder-decoder based methods are trained
with a learning rate of 3e-4 and a batch size of 16 for 6000
iterations. To obtain the best performance for each method,
we perform a greedy search up to two decimals to get the
threshold with best Dice score for each COVID-19 dataset.

• AE: An Autoencoder with a dense bottleneck z ∈ R
.
• VAE [49]: As the reconstruction is more difficult for lung
CT images, so we set α for KL loss as 1e-6 to make the
reconstruction easily.

• Context VAE [52]: Force the encoder to capture more
information by inpainting cropped input. We set crop size
to 32.
• Constrained VAE [53]: Map the reconstructed image to
the same point as the input in the latent space.
• GMVAE [54]: Replace the mono-modal prior of the VAE

part is marked as the detected abnormal area.
• f-AnoGAN [50]: To keep the training process of fAnogan stable, we resize the lung image to [64, 64] after
center crop.
In order to reveal the top-line for each dataset, we train nnUNet [68] in 5-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, to test the
performance of the supervised model when inferring unseen
datasets, we train nnU-Net on two COVID-19 datasets and test
on the left one, called nnU-Net-Unseen.
•

D. Segmentation results
Our NormNet firstly votes for the healthy tissues from the
CT volumes with COVID-19 lesions. To test the performance
of our NormNet, we collect all bright pixels with τ ≥ 0.33
of the CT volumes. As in Table II, our method successfully
distinguishes the COVID-19 lesion parts and healthy parts

with AUC larger than 85%. When we choose the prediction
threshold as 0.95, the high specificity ensures that most of
the lesions are treated as anomaly. Then, the post-processing
procedure grows the lesion area to contain more lesions with
less bright pixels (τ < 0.33). We also use mean filtering in
the post-processing to remove the isolated healthy pixels that
are segmented as anomaly, as shown in Fig. 5c. Therefore,
our method reaches the Dice scores of 68.7%, 59.4%3 and
69.7% (shown in Table III) in the two different COVID-19
datasets respectively, which are significantly ahead of other
unsupervised anomaly detection methods. The visual results
shown in Fig. 5 reveal that most of the COVID-19 lesions are
successfully (green area) segmented by our NormNet.

On the contrary, the other unsupervised anomaly detection
methods have limited power to segment COVID-19 lesion.
As shown in Fig. 6, due to the inaccurate reconstructions,
the reconstruction-based methods such as VAE [49] and fAnoGAN [50] can not reconstruct the tissues precisely. Such
a reconstruction error greatly affects the segmentation performance of COVID-19 lesions. On the other hand, the encoder
can not make sure to treat the COVID-19 lesion as anomaly,
and suppress the lesion in the reconstruction results. Thus
the KL-grad [43] and restoration [54] have less effect either.
These two serious shortcomings result in low COVID-19
3 we remove CT volume #6 from the Radiopedia dataset as it has only about
70 positive pixels in 42 slices.

1) Voting: To explore the effects of randomness in the
training process, we evaluate the performances of the five
models and their voting results with different number of
iterations. As shown in Table IV, the performances of the five
models oscillate as the iteration increases, while the NormNet
greatly alleviates this problem through the voting mechanism
of 5 models.
2) Modules of synthetic ‘lesion’ generator: The steps of
synthetic ‘lesion’ generator can be roughly divided into three

parts: Generate shapes (Gj in Section III-C.1), probability
maps (ai in (8)), and salt noises (Bi in (6)). To investigate the
influence of each part, we train a new NormNet without the
corresponding diversity. To eliminate the diversity of shapes,
we generate 5 ellipsoids with radius = 12 for any lung area
Hi without any deformation. For probability maps, we set
probability = 2. At last, we set σb = 2 and µ0 = 150 for
synthetic salt noises with the same texture. As shown in Table
V, the loss of diversities affects the accuracy of the decision
boundary and the segmentation performance. Especially, the
salt noises filtered and scaled by fixed parameters have limited
contexts, which are easily learned by the NormNet, resulting
in extremely inaccurate decision boundary. Thus, our various
synthetic ‘lesions’ can force the NormNet to learn a decision
boundary for healthy tissues, which can be further used to
segment COVID-19 lesions.

method. The red area means false positive while the blue area indicates
false negative.

3) Hyparameter analysis: The threshold of HU is important
in our method, since it filters the background noises while
trying to keep the pattern complexity at a level that can be
effectively managed by the network. On the one hand, if the
threshold is too high, our NormNet only segments healthy
pixels in a small-scale set, which causes more abnormal pixels
missing. On the other hand, if the threshold is too small,
some noisy pixels with complex contexts (as shown in Fig.
7) are segmented by the NormNet. It raises the difficulty
and turns the NormNet to capture the features of synthetic
‘lesions’ instead of healthy tissues, as we can not make sure
the contexts of synthetic ‘lesions’ are the same to COVID19 lesions, the NormNet overfits the synthetic ’lesions’ and
can not segment COVID-19 successfully. As in Table VI, the
performance drops rapidly when the HU threshold T = −700.

than τ are still missed (as shown in the right column of
Fig. 8). These small lesions also serve a difficult problem
for both supervised methods [17] and anomaly detection.
In future, we plan to extend our method to address the above
limitations and explore the possibility of applying the ‘lesion’
generator for segmentation in non-thoracic regions.

V. C ONCLUSIONS AND D ISCUSSIONS
In this paper, we propose the NormNet, a pixel-level
anomaly modeling network to turn an ‘abnormal’ volume
back to normal. A decision boundary for normal parts of
the NormNet is learned by segmenting healthy tissues from
the diverse synthetic ‘lesions’, which can be further used to
segment COVID-19 lesions, without training on any labeled
data. The experiments on two different COVID-19 datasets
validate the effectiveness of the NormNet.
Despite the improvement compared to existing unsupervised
anomaly detection methods, there is still a gap between our
methods and supervised methods such as nnU-Net [68]. After
exploring the failure predictions of our methods, we find that
they are divided into three categories:
1) Some anomalies such as pulmonary fibrosis (the first
row shown in Fig. 8) are treated as COVID-19 lesions.
2) Gaps between datasets: for example, most of the layer
thicknesses in Luna16 dataset are around 1mm. However, in Radiopedia dataset slices are padded together,
which generate different contexts. The unseen contexts
are treated as anomalies by our NormNet, which results
in the most of false-positives in Radiopedia dataset.
3) Our method is only sensitive to the pixels with values
larger than τ . Although most of lesions can be successfully detected, a small part of lesions with pixels smaller
