Abstract—We release our COVID-19 news dataset, containing
more than 10,000 links to news articles related to the Coronavirus
pandemic published in the Swiss media since early January 2020.
This collection can prove beneficial in mining and analysis of the
reaction of the Swiss media to the COVID-19 pandemic and
extracting insightful information for further research.
We hope this dataset helps researchers and the public deliver
results that will help analyse the pandemic and potentially lead
to a better understanding of the events.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic started in Switzerland on February 25th 2020, when the first infection was officially reported
in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino [1], [2]. Soon the
pandemic spread around the country on all cantons, and
Switzerland became one of the most infected countries on a
per-capita basis [3], [4].
The Swiss government started putting in place various
measures to control and suppress the pandemic. Gatherings
were limited and later totally banned, following by closure of
all except essential business, and finally closing land borders
with neighbouring countries [5].
These measures helped control the spread of the virus and
significantly decreased the number of active and daily new
cases in Switzerland. With the success confirmed, government
started gradually lifting the established restrictions from late
April [6]. Finally, the June 15th re-opening land borders with
the neighbouring countries marked the ”end” of the pandemic
in Switzerland, at least for the first wave [7].
Since the first recorded case of the COVID-19 virus in
Switzerland and far before as it was gaining attention around
the world, The Swiss media started covering the topic from
various aspects, including the everyday news about the state
of the country, the immediate effects, and longer-term consequences of the pandemic. Given the multi-lingual and multicultural nature of Switzerland, interesting analyses can be
accomplished to see how the media coverage of the pandemic
has been managed and what topics in respect to the pandemic
have been important to the Swiss media, and hopefully, by
proxy to the Swiss public.
In order to help the research community and the public
be able to analyse and seek answers to the above questions,

we at ELCA decided to release our COVID-19 news dataset,
containing more than 10,000 links to news articles related to
the Coronavirus pandemic published in the Swiss media since
early January 2020.
We hope this dataset helps researchers make insightful
analyses on the reaction of the Swiss public to the pandemic
and deliver results that help shape a better response in the
prospective future cases.
II. T HE DATA
We tried to cover the most popular Swiss newspapers and
news websites. Therefore, we chose a total of 10 news sources
in German, five in French, three in Italian, and also two
English-speaking Swiss news websites in order to make the
data more accessible to to researchers outside Switzerland.
Table I depicts the list of venues and some information about
them.

A. Selection of Relevant Articles
We backdated our data collection to late 2019, and started
scanning front pages of the selected news sources in consecutive days, extracting headlines of the articles. Initially, articles

with any of the following keywords in the title were deemed
”Coronavirus-related”:
• Coronavirus,
• Covid,
• Lockdown,
• Pandem* (To account for different spellings of the concept in different languages).
This inevitably leads to false negatives. In order to reduce
such false negatives, we read at a later stage the synopsis of the
article and searched for the keywords also in the body, yielding
more positive results. The distribution of the languages in the
dataset is depicted in Figure 1.
The first article we could find in the Swiss media has
been published on January 8th in the French-speaking news
portal 20 Minutes, titled ”A new Coronavirus appears in
China” [8]. We have made a web application to simplify exploring and browsing the data, and reading the collected news articles. The web application is available at
https://covidnewsdataset.herokuapp.com/.
S UMMARY
We explained in this article our Swiss COVID-19 dataset
and how it has been collected. We publish the dataset hereby
for public use, along with an online visualisation application
to help explore and look at the news articles of Swiss media
during the pandemic in Switzerland. We hope this dataset
proves useful in analysis of the pandemic era and the public
response to it in Switzerland.
