Containment measures implemented by some countries to suppress the spread of COVID-19 have
resulted in a slowdown of the epidemic characterized by time series of daily infections plateauing
over extended periods of time. We prove that such a dynamical pattern is compatible with critical
Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) dynamics. In traditional analyses of the critical SIR model,
the critical dynamical regime is started from a single infected node. The application of containment
measures to an ongoing epidemic, however, has the effect to make the system enter in its critical
regime with a number of infected individuals potentially large. We describe how such non-trivial
starting conditions affect the critical behavior of the SIR model. We perform a theoretical and
large-scale numerical investigation of the model. We show that the expected outbreak size is an
increasing function of the initial number of infected individuals, while the expected duration of the
outbreak is a non-monotonic function of the initial number of infected individuals. Also, we precisely
characterize the magnitude of the fluctuations associated with the size and duration of the outbreak
in critical SIR dynamics with non-trivial initial conditions. Far from heard immunity, fluctuations
are much larger than average values, thus indicating that predictions of plateauing time series may
be particularly challenging.

I.

INTRODUCTION

At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, world-wide
time series of the number of infected individuals have
displayed an exponential growth. Such a behavior is
well predicted by standard epidemic frameworks [1]. In
slightly later stages, however, time series have exhibited
non-trivial dynamical patterns. Many papers have attempted to model observed behaviors and to determine
the role of containment measures [2–17]. The common
and reasonable assumption is that containment measures
implemented in the attempt of mitigating the outbreak
have strongly influenced the unfolding of the epidemic.
Unfortunately, this a setting where modeling attempts
are particularly challenging. The effective implementation of containment measures imposed by authorities rely
on people’s personal judgements and adaptive behavior,
and while epidemic spreading is a well-studied branch
of mathematical biology [18], statistical physics [19] and
network science [20–26], the modelling of adaptive behavior is only at its infancy [27–29].
According to the data, in several countries, the slowdown of the epidemic spread is characterized by an almost flat time series of daily number of new infections.
Moreover, the time series of the number of removed individuals display power-law growth instead of an exponential growth as a function of time [12, 14, 16, 17]. Here,
we propose a theoretical interpretation of those features
as the signature of the system being in (or near) its critical regime. Criticality is a fundamental property characterizing the dynamics of biological and socio-technical
systems [30–32]. Our work consists of an in-depth investigation of a critical Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR)

dynamics starting from a non-trivial initial configuration
characterized by n0 initially infected individuals. We interpret the emergence of the critical regime as the result
of disease containment strategies, and the non-trivial initial condition as the configuration of the system when
spreading becomes critical. In the typical setting considered in statistical mechanics [33–35], a single seed is
generally used as the initial condition for critical SIR dynamics; the mapping of the critical SIR to the critical
standard branching process allows for a full characterization of the spreading dynamics [36, 37]. The realistic
assumption of having an initial number of infected individuals n0 > 1 introduces an additional scale in the
system affecting in a non-trivial manner the scaling properties of the SIR critical dynamics. While in other nonequilibrium systems a non-trivial initial condition may
lead to a change of the critical exponent values [38–40],
in the critical SIR, the introduction of a non-trivial initial condition does not change the critical exponents that
characterize the distribution of outbreak size and duration. However, it introduces lower exponential cutoffs in
the distributions. As a result, the expected size and duration of the outbreak, as well as their standard deviations,
have a non-trivial dependence on the initial condition n0 .
In this paper, we evaluate, by means of analytic arguments and large-scale simulations, the scaling of these
quantities as functions of the population size N .
The paper is structured as follows: in Section II, we
provide the theoretical interpretation of the plateau as a
critical SIR dynamics starting from n0 > 1 initial condition; in Section III, we perform a statistical mechanics investigation of the statistical properties of the critical SIR
dynamics with non-trivial initial conditions, supported

2
by extensive numerical simulations of the process; finally,
in Section IV, we provide concluding remarks. The Appendix describes the Gillespie algorithm used in this work
to simulate the critical SIR dynamics.

and the number of removed individuals remains vanishing. In the supercritical regime, i.e., λ > λc , the number
of infected and removed individuals displays an exponential increase. At criticality, i.e., λ = λc , the deterministic

THE THEORETICAL INTERPRETATION
OF THE PLATEAU

We consider the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR)
model on a well-mixed population [19–26]. At any point
in time, individuals can be found in three possible states:
susceptible, infected and removed. Susceptible individuals do not carry the disease but they can be infected; infected individuals carry the disease, and they can spread
it to susceptible individuals; removed individuals are either removed or deceased, and they do no participate in
the spreading dynamics. We indicate with λ the rate of
infection, i.e., the expected number of spreading events
occurring per unit of time. Without loss of generality, we
set the recovery rate equal to one.
We start our discussion by focusing on the deterministic treatment of the SIR model on a well-mixed population with infinite size. If we indicate with s, i and r the
fractions of susceptible, infected and removed individuals, respectively, we can write

If we start from an initial condition consisting of a fraction i(0) of infected individuals and a fraction r(0) = 0
of removed individuals, at the onset of the epidemic, i.e.,
t  1, we observe a different behavior depending on the
value of λ. In the non-critical regime, i.e., λ 6= λc , the
deterministic equations for i and r read

FIG. 1: a) Time series of the number of infected individuals
I(t) = i(t) N are plotted close to the critical point. I(t) correspond to the solution of the deterministic SIR equations.
The population size is N = 107 , and spreading is started
from n0 = 1 seed. Different curves correspond to different
values of λ = 1 + 2−q , with q = 2, 3, 4, . . . , 8, 9. b) Same
as in panel a, but for λ = 1. Different curves correspond to
different numbers of initially infected nodes n0 = 2q , with
q = 2, 3, 4, . . . , 8, 9. As λ approaches the critical value λc = 1
and n0 decreases toward one, we observe a plateauing of the
time series.

From the deterministic Eqs. (1), it is evident that

Therefore, according to the deterministic approach, for
small times we should expect that the number of removed

The former equation implies that the time series of
infected individuals i(t) has a peak at t = t? determined
by

(10)

The fraction of susceptible individuals at the peak of the
epidemic is given by s? = s(t? ) = 1/λ. By making the
further assumption that the epidemic starts from a fraction i(0) = 1 − s(0) of infected individuals and zero removed individuals r(0) = 0 in Eq. (8), we obtain

III. SIR CRITICAL DYNAMICS WITH
NON-TRIVIAL INITIAL CONDITION

From now on, we assume that the system is in the critical regime. We further assume that spreading dynamics
is started from n0 > 1 initial seeds. The two assumptions
serve to rationalize two main features of real time series.
First, time series are characterized by long temporal windows of almost flat behavior. This is a signature of criticality. Second, plateaus are observed only after initial
growths in the number of infected individuals, meaning
that the critical regime is reached only after that containment strategies have effectively changed the spreading dynamics of the disease. Whereas critical properties
of the SIR model are well understood for spreading processes initiated by n0 = 1 individual, we are not aware
of existing studies dealing with non-trivial initial conditions consisting of n0 > 1 seeds. How do the properties
of the critical dynamics change with n0 ? What is the behavior of the expected duration of the outbreak? What
about the expected size of the outbreak? What about
their fluctuations?

ln i is never achieved for λ > 1.
In the vicinity of the critical point, the time series
of the infected individuals is still well described by a
plateau. Developing the right-hand side of Eq. (13)

The above equation indicates that the conditions to have

from heard immunity, i.e., 1 − s(0)  1. In summary,
the near-critical state for λ ' 1 is a fragile state that can
be characterized by a very slow dynamics if containment
measures do not further decrease the infectivity λ below
one (see Figure 1).

FIG. 2: We show three examples of time series for the number of infected individuals I(t) (panels a, c and e) and the
corresponding number of removed individuals R(t) (panels b,
d and f) for a critical SIR dynamics with non-trivial initial
condition. The time series are obtained by simulating the
stochastic SIR dynamics at criticality (with λ = 1) on a wellmixed population with identical parameters: initial number
of infected individuals n0 = 128 and population size N = 107 .
The dashed lines indicate the corresponding deterministic predictions.

Please note that all the above questions cannot be answered with a purely deterministic approach. SIR outbreak sizes and durations obey probability distributions
that are well peaked around their expected value only if

4
the system is off criticality. However, the very fact that
the system is assumed to be in the critical regime implies
that fluctuations have a dominant role in the determination of the properties of the dynamical system. In Figure
2 for example, we display time series representative for
the critical regime of the dynamics. Ground-truth time
series are obtained by simulating the SIR stochastic dynamics (see Appendix A for details). They are compared
with the deterministic expectation value obtained by integrating Eqs. (1). We note that some realizations of the
process are more persistent and more pervasive in the
population than what predicted by the expected value.
From here on, we abandon the deterministic SIR equations and we embrace a stochastic approach. Critical SIR
dynamics starting from a single initial seed, i.e., n0 = 1,
is known to be characterized by extremely large fluctuations of the outbreak size and duration. These fluctuations can be quantified by leveraging the mapping between critical SIR in a well-mixed population and the
mean-field branching process. In the following sections,
we first review results valid for n0 = 1. Then, we focus
our attention on the non-trivial case n0 > 1.

A.

Critical dynamics with n0 = 1 initial seed

If the initial condition is such that only one node is
in the infected state while all other nodes are in the
susceptible state, the critical SIR model gives rise to
outbreaks that follow the statistics of a critical branching process [36, 37] corrected by some scaling functions
FT (N/NT? ) and FR (N/NR? ) that implement the effective
cutoff caused by finite-size effects [33, 34]. Here, N is the
size of the system; NT? and NR? are instead parameters
that determine when the cutoff takes place. Specifically,
the distribution P (T ) of the duration T of an outbreak
follows the law
P (T ) ∼ T −2 FT (N/NT? ),

(16)

while the size of the outbreak R follows the distribution
P (R) ∼ R−3/2 FR (N/NR? ).
NT?

(17)

NR?

The cutoff sizes
and
have been derived in
Refs. [33, 34]. They are given by
NT? = T 3 , NR? = R3/2 .

(18)

From the expressions for P (T ) and P (R) given by
Eqs. (16) and (17), respectively, and further assuming
a sharp cutoff, it is easy to deduce that the scaling with
the system size N of the average outbreak size hRi, the
average duration hT i, and the standard deviations σR
and σT [33, 34] obey
hRi ∼ N 1/3 , σR ∼ N 1/2 ,
hT i ∼ ln N, σT ∼ N 1/6 .

(19)

We observe that all the above quantities are subextensive, as they all grow sub-linearly with the system
size. The expected critical outbreak size hRi grows as
the system size to the power of 1/3. However, the standard deviation associated to the outbreak size, i.e., σR ,
grows with increasing system size much faster than hRi.
This fact indicates that it is very challenging to make
predictions if the dynamics is critical. Similarly, the outbreak duration is characterized by large fluctuations in
the large population limit. We note that the exponents
2 and 3/2 of the distribution P (T ) and P (R) are the
critical mean-field exponents. These exponents are universal and are observed for many critical spreading processes [41]. They characterize the critical SIR on network
topologies too as long as the underlying network has a homogeneous degree distribution. In power-law networks,
these exponents can deviate from their mean-field values
as investigated in Refs. [41, 42].
We have seen in Section II that the deterministic approach predicts a linear increase of the number of removed individuals with time for small time. However,
such a prediction is not accurate for the ground-truth
dynamics; accounting for stochastic effects correctly predicts a quadratic growth of the number of removed individuals in time when the epidemic starts with a single
initial seed. To this end, the number of removed individuals grows in time as a power law
z

R=t ,

(20)

where z is a dynamical critical exponent, and t is the
expectation value of the time necessary to observe R removed individuals. The value of the dynamical critical
exponent can be obtained in different ways [37]. Here, we
present the derivation of the value of the dynamical exponent based on Langevin-like equations for the dynamics.
Starting from an initial fraction of infected individuals
i(0) = n0 /N and a fraction r(0) = 0 of removed individuals we write
√
di
= (λs − 1)i + c iη(t),
dt
dr
= i,
(21)
dt
where η(t) is an uncorrelated white noise with E(η(t)) =
0 and E(η(t)η(t0 )) = δ(t − t0 ) and c is a constant. At
criticality, i.e., λ = λc = 1, thus, assuming t  1 and
i(0)  1, we have λs − 1 ' −i(0). We can therefore
write
√
di
= c iη(t),
dt
dr
= i.

We now perform a simple scaling analysis of this stochastic equations as usually done in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, e.g., Refs. [38, 43, 44]. If we rescale time

(27)
(28)

In summary, in the critical dynamical regime, if the
spreading is started from a single initial seed, we expect
that the average number of removed individuals grows
quadratically with time.
B.

Critical dynamics with n0 > 1 initial seeds

Critical SIR dynamics started from the non-trivial initial condition n0 > 1 differs from the critical SIR dynamics started from n0 = 1 seed. To include an explicit dependence on the parameter n0 in the scaling of Eq. (20),
we correct it by introducing the scaling function F (x),
where x = n0 /t(R). We impose that


F (u) ∼

1 if u  1
uβ if u  1

(30)

According to the deterministic SIR equations for t  1
and i(0)  1, the number of removed individuals grows
linearly in time with a slope i(0) = n0 /N . Thus, we
deduce that
β = 1.

(31)

This value is well supported by extensive numerical results (see Figure 3) which confirm that there is a crossover between linear and quadratic dependence of R on
t(R).
In the simulation of the SIR model, it is natural to
study the behavior of R as a function of t(R). However,
in real epidemic time series, the number of infected individuals is measured over constant time intervals. The
two ways of monitoring the evolution of the process, i.e.,
R versus t(R) rather than R(t) versus time t, may lead
to the observation of different scaling exponents. The

discrepancy is due to the stochastic nature of the spreading process. The phenomenon is apparent from the results of Figure 3: depending on the type of measurement
performed on the system, the power-law increase of the
number of removed individuals as a function of time can
be described by a continuous range of exponents ranging
from ξ = 1 to ξ ∼ 2.5. We can therefore write
R(t) ' n0 tξ h(t, N )

(32)

where ξ is a decreasing function of n0 , and h(t, N ) is a
modulating function expressing the deviation from the
pure power-law behavior. The ansatz of the above equation is compatible with the power-law scaling of the empirical time series of removed individuals as a function of
time observed in countries where containment measures
have been implemented extensively [12, 14, 16, 17].

C. Distribution of avalanche durations and sizes
for the critical SIR model initiated by n0 > 1 seeds

In this section we investigate the statistical properties
of the distribution of outbreak duration and size for the

6
critical SIR dynamics in a well mixed-population when
the initial condition is non-trivial, i.e., n0 > 1. Scaling
arguments suggest the following expression for the distribution P (T ) of the critical outbreak duration T
P (T ) ∼ n0 T

−2

FT (N/NT? , n0 /T ).

(33)

The above scaling function is a natural modification of
Eq. (16) by assuming that n0 scales like time. In particular, the distribution P (T ) is characterized by a lower cutoff depending on n0 . This fact is intuitive as an outbreak
with a larger number of initially infected individuals is
not expected to reach the absorbing state faster than an
outbreak started by a single seed (see Figure 4a). We
note that, in the critical SIR dynamics, the dependence
on n0 does not lead to a change of the critical exponent
values, as for example observed in other non-equilibrium
phase transitions [38–40]. In Figure 5a, we display the
function
wT (n0 , T ) = − ln

FT (N/NT? , n0 /T )
FT (N/NT? , 1/T )

(34)

and we demonstrate that the scaling function wT (n0 /T )
for n0  NT? can be approximated as
wT (n0 , T ) ' −

n0 − 1
.
T

(35)

Finally, we note that while the scaling behavior described
in Eq. (35) has strong numerical confirmation for T 
NT? for values of T ∼ NT? the scaling function wT (n0 , T )
signals a dependence of the cutoff on n0 (see Figure 5).
Scaling arguments suggest that the distribution P (R)
of critical outbreak size R should obey
P (R) ∼ n0 R

The scaling behavior, valid for n0  N 1/3 , can be justified by assuming that each of the n0 seeds generates
an independent outbreak obeying the statistics of the
critical branching process. A critical avalanche started
from a single infected individual has a duration T following the power-law distribution π(T ) ∼ T −2 [36, 37].
Thus, assuming independence among the n0 avalanches,
we can estimate the probability P (T ) as the probability
that among all n0 outbreaks the last outbreak to get extinguished is extinguished at time T . Therefore in the
infinite population limit we obtain
P (T ) ' n0 [1 − πc (T )]n0 −1 π(T ),

where the function FR (N/NR? , n0 , R) implements a lower
cutoff dependent exponentially on n0 (see Figure 4b).

FIG. 5: The function wT (n0 , T ) and wR (n0 , R) defined in
Eq. (34) (panel a) and Eq. (39) (panel b) are plotted for a

2q , with q = 2, 3, 4, . . . , 10, 11. The dashed lines correspond
to the scaling expressed in Eq. (35) and Eq. (40).

In Figure 5b, we show the function
wR (n0 , R) = − ln

This scaling function indicates that, for large values of
R, R scales like n20 . For small values of R, it is possible

7
to observe some corrections would be required to fully
describe the scaling. We notice that, in the first order in
n0 , the normalization constant of the distribution P (R)
is independent of n0 . A way to interpret the result is by
considering the infinite population limit approximating
the distribution P (R) as the convolution of the n0 sizes
of independent outbreak events. In this limit we have

in first approximation that Π(r) is a pure power law
Π(r) ∼ r−3/2 , it follows that the logarithm of the√generating function behaves, for small ω, as ln F(ω) ∼ ω. The
result, together with Eq. (41), indicates that R should
scale as n20 for n0  N 2/3 . For mor details on the infinite population limit we refer the reader to Ref. [45].

Statistical properties of the critical outbreak
started by n0 > 1 seeds
1.

General scenario

We performed large-scale simulations of the critical
SIR model to address fundamental questions regarding
the distributions of duration T and size R of outbreaks
started by a non-trivial initial condition n0 > 1. In Figure 6, we display the average values and the standard
deviations of both T and R for a large system composed
of N = 108 individuals. We display the moments of the
distributions as a function of the number of initial seeds
n0 . The main outcomes are as follows. The expected
size hRi is a growing function of n0 . The expected duration hT i is a non-monotonic function of n0 , displaying
a single peak. The standard deviations σT and σR also
display a peak as a function of n0 . The coefficient of variation σT /hT i and σR /hRi are monotonically decreasing
with n0 . We conclude that fluctuations are fundamental
to properly characterize the critical dynamical regime.
This statement is true for any value of n0 , albeit, in
relative terms, the most severe effect of fluctuations is
observed for n0 = 1. We note that as the initial number of infected individuals n0 increases, the expected size
of the outbreak displays a monotonic increase while the
expected duration of the outbreak displays a maximum.
In the following subsection, we will provide scaling laws
for these major statistical properties of the critical dynamics as a function of the number of initially infected
individuals.

Scaling analysis of hT i and σT

We make the ansatz that the average duration hT i can
be described by
hT i ' G(n0 |α, β, H, K),

(42)

where the function G(n0 |α, β, H, K) is given by
G(n0 |α, β, H, K) =

nα
0H
1 + nβ0 K

.

(43)

Here, α and β are, in the large population limit, independent of N . On the contrary, H and K are dependent
on the population size. By introducing the function
g(x|α, β) =

xα
,
1 + xβ

(44)

we observe that it is possible to rescale the curves obtained for different values of N by performing the transformation
H −1 K α/β G(n0 |α, β, H, K) = g(n0 K 1/β |α, β).

(45)

This expression allows us to perform a data collapse of
the data obtained for hT i at different values of n0 and
different population size N (see Figure 7a).
We observe that, if we start from a non-trivial initial
condition n0 , the expected duration of the outbreak hT i
reaches its maximum at

The scaling parameters H and K obey the scaling relation
with aH = 0.58 ± 0.08, bH = −2.0 ± 0.9, δK = −0.37 ±
0.04 and aK = 0.75 ± 0.06 (see Figure 9). We note that
the logarithmic scaling of H is expected from the known
scaling of hT i for the SIR critical model starting from a
single initial seed. The exponents α and β are given by

single initial seed. Moreover, the exponent α and β for
σT are given by
α = 0.50 ± 0.05, β = 1.0 ± 0.1.

instead fitted using the same ansatz as σT , i.e.,
σR ' G(n0 |α, β, H, K).

already took place. We have shown that a non-trivial
initial condition n0 > 1 introduces another typical scale
on the dynamics inducing a lower cutoff in the distributions of the duration and size of critical outbreaks. The
critical dynamics is characterized by very strong fluctuations, but the presence of a non-trivial initial condition mitigates the role of the fluctuations. In particular,
while for a single initial seed the standard deviation on
the outbreak size and duration is much larger than the
corresponding expectation values, the relative error diminishes as the size n0 of the initial seed set increases.
Moreover, numerical results indicate that, as the initial
number of infected individuals n0 increases, the expected
size of the outbreak increases while the expected duration
first increases and then decreases, displaying a maximum.
Using scaling arguments, and extensive numerical simulations we have deduced the scaling of the maximum duration and the corresponding number of initially infected
individuals.

CONCLUSIONS

Motivated by the current COVID-19 pandemic,
we have investigated the critical properties of the
Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) dynamics in wellmixed populations starting from non-trivial initial conditions consisting of n0 > 1 infected individuals. Although
the modeling framework oversimplifies the real-world scenario, the setting is realistic in two main respects. First,

Appendix A: Stochastic SIR dynamics on well
mixed populations

The critical SIR dynamics in a well-mixed population
of N individuals is simulated with the following implementation of the Gillespie algorithm [46]. We indicate
with S(t), I(t) and R(t) respectively the number of susceptible, infected and removed individuals as a function
of time t. We start from the initial condition of I(0) = n0 ,
S(0) = N − n0 and R(0) = 0. At each elementary step,
the algorithm proceeds as follows:
(i) Time increases by the amount ∆t
t → t + ∆t,

(A1)

where ∆t is given by
∆t =

− log(q)
.
λS(t)I(t) + I(t)

(A2)

with q ∼ Unif.(0,1), i.e., a random variate extracted
from the uniform distribution in the domain (0, 1).
(ii) With probability
p=

λS(t)I(t)
λS(t)I(t) + I(t)

(A3)

11
a susceptible individual becomes infected, i.e.,
S(t + ∆t) = S(t) − 1,
I(t + ∆t) = I(t) + 1.

(A4)

(iii) With probability 1 − p an infected individual is removed, i.e.,
I(t + ∆t) = I(t) − 1,
R(t + ∆t) = R(t) + 1.

(A5)

The critical dynamics is obtained by setting λ = 1. The
steps of the algorithms are iterated until the number of
infected individuals is zero. This happens at time T , i.e.,
the duration of the outbreak. The size of the outbreak is
given by R(T ).
