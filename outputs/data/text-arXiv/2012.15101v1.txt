Abstract
The rapid outbreaks of lethal viruses necessitate the development of novel antiviral
substance. Besides the conventional antiviral substances, biocompatible nanomaterials also
have significant potential in combating the virus at various stages of infection. Carbon
nanomaterials have an impressive record against viruses and can deal with many crucial
healthcare issues. In accordance with the published literature, biocompatible carbon
nanomaterials have a promising prospect as an antiviral substance. Subsequently, the antiviral
properties of different carbon nanomaterials namely fullerene, carbon nanotube, carbon dot
and graphene oxide have been reviewed.

Keywords: Fullerene; Carbon nanotube; Carbon dot; Graphene oxide; Antiviral; COVID-19.

The world is facing an unprecedented medical emergency since December 2019 owing to a
new strain of coronavirus which is named as severe acute respiratory-related coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2)1. Various detection strategies are being employed to refrain off the
transmission chain of the disease which is mainly based on immunological assays or using

amplification techniques. The methods involving immunological assays suffer from the
drawback of the requirement of complex production of antibodies and recombinant proteins
while amplification-based techniques require expensive instruments and skilled personnel2.
To overcome the inherent problems of the standard detection techniques many new
nanotechnology-based approaches have evolved3,4 incorporating carbon nanomaterials5.
However, mere detection is not enough to break the chain, the development of a new
generation of antiviral tools is urgently needed to combat this pandemic.
Antiviral substances can be categorised as virostatic and virucidal6. The working of virostatic
substances is based on a binding mechanism and they act in the early stages of infection by
reducing viral replication rate, while virucidal substances can deactivate the virus
permanently. These antiviral substances are of the order of nanometer and they interact well
with nanosized viruses via biochemical interaction. In this regard, carbon nanomaterials show
great potential to be used as an antiviral substance because of their novel physio-chemical
characteristic7.

The first carbon nanomaterial fullerene was discovered in 1985 by Prof Smalley’s group and
it is also the first candidate to be tested as the antiviral substance in 1993 by Sijbesma et al.8.
It was found that fullerenes fit well into the active sites of the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) and can block the encoded enzymes. Later on, several researchers have synthesised
different tailor-made fullerene derivatives to achieve higher inhibition of HIV-1 maturation9,
HIV-RT10 or HIV-1 protease11. In some cases, the solubility of antiviral substance is required
and interestingly it is possible to synthesise water-soluble fullerene while keeping their
antiviral activity intact12. Kornev et al.13 developed water-soluble polycarboxylic derivatives
of fullerene which showed pronounced antiviral activity against HIV and influenza A virus.
Carboxylic derivatives of fullerene also have been effective to inhibit Herpes Simplex Virus

and Cytomegalovirus14. Kataoka et al.15 synthesised proline-type fullerene to inhibit Hepatitis
C virus protease successfully. Falynskova et al.16 produced a tailor-made fullerene compound
fullerene-(tris-aminocaproic acid) hydrate to hinder the Respiratory Syncytial Virus
multiplication in HEp-2 cell, however application time is crucial for effective inhibition of
the virus. Fullerene derivatives are also able to inhibit the Zika Virus and Dengue viruses17.
Non-derivatized fullerene is also employed for efficient inhibition of viruses like simian
immunodeficiency virus and the Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV)18. Moreover,
fullerene can produce singlet oxygen (1O2) upon illumination by visible light19 (Fig 1). This
property of fullerene has been utilized by several researchers for the inactivation of
viruses20,21 even in water22 and can be used for the sanitization of indoor air23. Thus, fullerene
can be effectively employed to combat RNA type viruses.

Fig 1. A ground-state fullerene absorbs a photon, transitions to the short-lived (nsec) excited
singlet state that can undergo intersystem crossing to the long-lived (µsec) excited triplet
state. The triplet fullerene can relax to ground state by emitting phosphorescence, but can also
undergo energy transfer with ground state triplet oxygen (3O2) to form reactive singlet
oxygen (1O2, Type 2) or else can undergo an electron transfer reaction to form HO•,
superoxide and H2O2 (Type 1). These ROS (1O2 and HO•) can damage lipids, proteins and
nucleic acids leading to the destruction of all types of microbial cells, and efficiently kill
cancer cells and destroy tumors. (Reproduced with permission from Royal Society of

Another carbon allotrope, namely carbon nanotube (CNT) was first reported in 1952 25, but
after the description provided by Ijima in 1991,26 it gains worldwide attention. Krishnaraj et
al.27 theoretically studied the molecular interaction between CNT and HIV. Their results
revealed that CNT has a high binding affinity towards the proteins of HIV, demonstrating the
antiviral activity. Single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), both in pristine form and
decorated with metal (Pt, Pd, Ni, Cu, Rh, or Ru) nanoparticles were examined to study the
adsorption of hydrogen peroxide (as a representative of the ROS family) by Aasi et al.28
employing density functional theory. The results exhibited that hydrogen peroxide is weakly
physisorbed on pristine SWCNT while strong physisorption was found on metal decorated
SWCNTs. Moreover, metal decorated SWCNTs showed long shelf lives which make it a
potential candidate for designing the antiviral surfaces and personal protection equipment
(PPE). Banerjee et al.29 prepared porphyrin-conjugated multi-walled carbon nanotubes
(MWCNTs) by attaching protoporphyrin IX to acid-functionalized MWCNTs. Under the
illumination of visible light, the prepared material considerably suppressed the ability of
Influenza A virus to infect mammalian cells. Differently functionalized MWCNTs were
studied by Iannazzo et al.30 for their in-vitro anti-HIV activity. The results revealed that
hydrophilic functionality and water dispersibility of functionalized MWCNTs governed the
antiviral activity against HIV. Henceforth, it can be seen that CNT can be potentially used for
deactivation of RNA type viruses.
Carbon dots (CDs) were accidentally discovered by Xu et al.31 in 2004 and later in 2006 Sun
et al. produced stable photoluminescent carbon nanoparticles having different sizes and
named as “Carbon Quantum Dots” (CQDs)32. On the other hand graphene quantum dot
(GQD) was discovered in 2008 by Ponomarenko et al.33. There is a structural difference
between GQD and CD. CDs are generally quasi-spherical in shape and are smaller than 10
nm in size, while GQD has graphene lattice having a size of less than 100 nm34. Barras et

al.35 reported that functionalized CDs with boronic acid can restrict the entry of herpes
simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) at its early stage. Functionalized CDs with boronic acid also
have the potential to inhibit HIV-1 entry36. Du et al.37 examined inhibition characteristics of
CDs on RNA and DNA model type viruses. Pseudorabies virus (PRV) was considered as a
DNA model type virus and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)
was used as an RNA model type virus for this study. They found that CDs induces interferonα and inhibit virus replication for both RNA and DNA type viruses (Fig 2). Glycyrrhizic acid
was used to synthesis CD by Tong et al.38 and the prepared CDs depicted a broad spectrum of
antiviral activity against various viruses like PRRSV, pseudorabies virus (PRV) and porcine
epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Lin et al.39 derived CDs from curcumin (Cur-CQDs)
through one-step dry heating and found that the obtained CDs possessed strong antiviral
activity against enterovirus 71 (EV71) via scavenging free radicals and strong antioxidant
activity. To examine the antiviral property of curcumin derived CDs for inhibition of
coronavirus model type virus Ting et al.40 used PEDV. It was revealed that the curcumin
derived CDs inhibited the viral entry by changing the structure of virus surface proteins and
reduced the viral replication via stimulation of the production of interferon-stimulating genes
(ISGs). The effect of functionalization using boronic acid on seven types of CDs to inhibit
human coronavirus was studied by Łoczechin et al.41. The derived carbon nanostructures
depicted concentration-dependent virus inactivation at the viral replication step. Huang et
al.42 prepared benzoxazine monomer derived CDs and showed that the derived nanostructure
possessed broad-spectrum antiviral ability against life-threatening flaviviruses (Japanese
encephalitis, Zika, and dengue viruses) and non-enveloped viruses (porcine parvovirus and
adenovirus-associated virus). Norovirus can also be inhibited by surface passivated CDs as
reported by Dong et al.43. Ju et al.44 reported that CDs are even effective for the inhibition of
viral microRNA by regulating the proliferation and survival of virus-induced cancer cells.

GQD has also has been used for inhibition of virus. Lannazzo et al.45 synthesized watersoluble GQD by prolonged oxidation of multiwall carbon nanotube and used it for the
inhibition of HIV RT.

After the first demonstration of easy isolation of graphene by Geim and Novoselov, from
bulk graphite in 200447, graphene and its derivatives have been widely used in different
sectors of the medical industry (Fig 3). Sametband et al.48used graphene oxide (GO)
derivatives to inhibit HSV-1 via viral attachment blocking. The GO blocked HSV-1
infections at relatively low concentrations and the charge density was the major factor
affecting the inhibition of virus. Two typical enteric viruses, EV71 and Influenza A virus
subtype (H9N2), were used as target viruses by Song et al.49 for inhibition by GO and found
that GO could completely remove the target viruses by destruction and disinfection
properties. Yang et al.50 functionalised GO with β-cyclodextrin and used it as an antiviral
substance to inhibit RNA type respiratory syncytial virus.

His result showed that the

functionalised GO can inactivate the virus directly. The photocatalytic activity of GO51 has
also been explored by the researchers for the inhibition of viruses. Hu et al.52 prepared GO

functioned aptamer and used it for successful photocatalysis of viruses via energy transfer
under visible light illumination. Graphene-tungsten oxide composite thin films were
synthesized by Akhavan et al.53 which exhibited an outstanding photocatalytic performance
in photoinactivation of bacteriophage MS2 viruses in the presence of visible light.

In summary, SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the RNA virus family and has created a medical
emergency worldwide because of its deadly nature and rapid transmission rate. To combat the
present situation various carbon nanomaterials, like fullerene, CNT, CD, GQD and GO can
be employed as antiviral substances because of their capability of inhibiting RNA type

virus55, biocompatibility and low toxicity. Thus, it can be believed that these unique carbon
nanomaterials will pave the way to combat the fatal SARS-CoV-2 in near future.
