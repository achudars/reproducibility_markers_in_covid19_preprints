Abstract
One of the central tools to control the COVID-19 pandemics is the knowledge of its spreading
dynamics. Here we develop a fractal model capable of describe this dynamics, in term of daily
new cases, and provide quantitative criteria for some predictions. We propose a fractal dynamical
model using conformed derivative and fractal time scale. A Burr-XII shaped solution of the fractallike equation is obtained. The model is tested using data from several countries, showing that a
single function is able to describe very different shapes of the outbreak. The diverse behavior of
the outbreak on those countries is presented and discussed. Moreover, a criterion to determine the
existence of the pandemic peak and a expression to find the time to reach herd immunity are also
obtained.

INTRODUCTION

The worldwide pandemic provoked by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak have attracted the attention of the scientiﬁc community due to, among other features, its fast
spread. Its strong contamination capacity has created a fast growing population of people
enduring COVID-19, its related disease, and a non small peak of mortality. The temporal
evolution of contagion over diﬀerent countries and worldwide brings up a common dynamic
characteristic, in particular, its fast rise to reach a maximum followed by a slow decrease
(incidentally, very similar to other epidemic processes) suggesting some kind of relaxation
process, which we try to deal with, since relaxation is, essentially, a process where the parameters characterizing a system are altered, followed by a tendency to equilibrium values.
In Physics, clear examples are, among others, dielectric or mechanical relaxation. In other
ﬁelds (psychology, economy, etc.) there are also phenomena in which an analogy with "common" relaxation can be established. In relaxation, temporal behavior of parameters is of
medular methodological interest. That is why pandemics can be conceived as one in which
this behavior is also present. For this reason, we are interested, despite the existence of statistical or dynamical systems method, in the introduction of a phenomenological equation
containing parameters that reﬂect the system´s behavior, from which its dynamics emerges.
We are interested in studying the daily presented new cases, not the current cases by day.
This must be noted to avoid confusion in the interpretation, i.e. we study not the cumulative
number of infected patients reported in databases, but its derivative. This relaxation process
in this case is, for us, an scenario that, by analogy, will serve to model the dynamics of the
pandemics. This is not an ordinary process. Due to the concurrence of many factors that
make very complex its study, its description must turn out to non classical description. So,
we will consider that the dynamics of this pandemic is described by a "fractal" or internal
time [1]. The network formed by the people in its daily activity forms a complex ﬁeld of
links very diﬃcult, if not impossible, to describe. However, we can take a simpliﬁed model
where all the nodes belong to a small world network, but the time of transmission from one
node to other diﬀers for each link. So, in order to study this process let us assume that
spread occurs in "fractal time" or internal time [1, 2]. This is not a new tool in physics.
In refs. [3–5] this concept has been successfully introduced and here, we keep in mind the
possibility of a fractal-like kinetics [6], but generalizing as a nonlinear kinetic process. Here
2

we will follow to what we refer as a "relaxation-like" approach, to model the dynamics of
the pandemic and that justify the fractal time. By analogy with relaxation, an anomalous
relaxation, we build up a simple nonlinear equation with fractal-time. We also regain the
analytical results using a deformed derivative approach, using conformable derivative (CD)
[7]. In Ref. [8] one of the authors (J.W.) have shown intimate relation of this derivative
with complex systems and nonadditive statistical mechanics. This was done without resort
to details of any kind of speciﬁc entropy deﬁnition.
Our article is outlined as follows: In Section 2, we present the fractal model formulated
in terms of conformable derivatives, to develop the relevant expressions to adjust data of
COVID-19. In Section 3, we show the results and ﬁgures referring to the data ﬁtting along
with discussions. In section 4, we ﬁnally cast our general conclusions and possible paths for
further investigations.

2.

FRACTAL MODEL

Let us denote by F (t) the number of contagions up to time t.
The CD is deﬁned as [7]
f (x + ǫx1−α ) − f (x)
.
ǫ→0
ǫ

Dxα f (x) = lim

(1)

Note that the deformation is placed in the independent variable.
For diﬀerentiable functions, the CD can be written as
Dxα f = x1−α

df
.
dx

(2)

An important point to be noticed here is that the deformations aﬀect diﬀerent functional
spaces, depending on the problem under consideration. For the conformable derivative [8–
12], the deformations are put in the independent variable, which can be a space coordinate,
in the case of, e.g, mass position dependent problems, or even time or spacetime variables, for
temporal dependent parameter or relativistic problems. Since we are dealing with a complex
system, a search for a mathematical approach that could take into account some fractality
or hidden variables seems to be adequate. This idea is also based in the fact that we do
not have full information about the system under study. In this case, deformed derivatives
with fractal time seems to be a good option to deal with this kind of system. Deformed
3

derivatives, in the context of generalized statistical mechanics are present and connected
[8]. There, the authors have also shown that the q − def ormed derivative has also a dual
derivative and a q − exponential related function [13]. Here, in the case under study, the
deformation is considered for the solutions-space or dependent variable, that is, the number
F (t) of contagions up to time t. One should also consider that justiﬁcation for the use
of deformed derivatives ﬁnds its physical basis on the mapping into the fractal continuum
[8, 14–16]. That is, one considers a mapping from a fractal coarse grained (fractal porous)
space, which is essentially discontinuous in the embedding Euclidean space, to a continuous
one [9]. In our case the fractality lies in the temporal variable. Then the CD is with respect
to time.
A nonlinear relaxation model can be proposed here, again based on a generalization of
Brouers-Sotolongo fractal kinetic model (BSf) [3, 4, 17], but here represented by a nonlinear
equation written in terms of CD:
Dtα F =

1 q
F ,
τα

(3)

where τ is our "relaxation time" and q and α here are real parameters. We do not impose
any limit for the parameters. Equation (3) has as a well known solution a function with the
shape of Burr XII [18], with :

F = F0 [1 + (1 − q)

1
(tα − tα0 ) 1−q
.
1−q ]
α
τ αF0

(4)

The density (in a similar form of a PDF, but here it is not a PDF) is, then:

f (t) =
where C = 1 −

(1−q)tα

can be expressed as:
f (t) = A′ [C + B ′ tα ]−b ta−1

where the parameter are A′ =

(5)

F0q

τα

B ′ = (1 − q) τ α αF1 1−q , b =

a = α.

Or, in a simpler form for data adjustment purposes
f (t) = A[1 + Btα ]−b ta−1 ,
with A =

A′
,

B=

B′
.

(7)

This is very similar, though not equal, to the function proposed by Tsallis [19, 20] in an
ad hoc way. Here, however, a physical representation by the method of analogy is proposed
to describe the evolution of the pandemics. Though we have introduced A, B, C, b, and a
as parameters to simplify the ﬁtting, the true adjustment constants are, clearly, q, τ and α.
Note that we do not impose any restrictive values to the parameters.
There is no need to demand that the solution always converge. The equation to obtain
Burr XII has to impose restrictions but this is not the case. In Burr XII the function
was used as a probability distribution. But here the function describes a dynamic, which
can be explosive, as will be shown for the curves of Brazil and Mexico. Therefore, if we
consider inﬁnite population, a peak will never be reached unless the circumstances change
(treatments, vaccines, isolation, etc.). Our model does not impose ﬁniteness of the solution.
The possibility for a decay of the pandemic in a given region in this model requires the
fulﬁllment of the condition
a(1 − b) − 1 < 0,

(8)

lim f (t) = 0,

(9)

what expresses the property that
t→∞

what means that the function has a local maximum. If this condition is not accomplished,
the pandemic does not have a peak and, therefore, the number of cases increases forever in
this model.
In this case there is, apart from the change of propagation and development conditions,
the possibility for a given country that does not satisﬁes condition (8), to reach "herd
immunity", i.e., when the number of contagions has reached about 60% of population, in
which case we may calculate the time to reach such state using (4), assuming t0 = 0:
Thi = [(0.6P )1/(1−b) − 1)/B]1/a .

(10)

We will work with what we will call T1000 ahead and that seems to make more sense and
bring more information.

DATA FITTING

With eq. (7) let us ﬁt the data of the epidemic worldwide. The data was extracted from
Johns Hopkins University [21] and the website [22] to process the data for several countries.
5

We covered the infected cases taken at Jan 22 as day 1, up to June 13. The behavior of
new infected cases by day is shown in ﬁgure 1. The ﬁtting was made with gnuplot 5.2. As
it seems, the pandemic shows some sort of "plateau", so the present measures of prevention
are not able to eliminate the infection propagation in a short term, but it can be seen that
condition (8) is weakly fulﬁlled.

Figure 1. Worldwide infections from Jan, 22 to June 13 and fitting with eq. (7). The
behavior fits well with parameters in Table I. Condition (8) is satisfied.

In the particular case of Mexico the ﬁtting is shown in ﬁgure 2. In this case condition (8)
is not fulﬁlled. In terms of our model this means that the peak is not predictable within the
present dynamics. Something similar occurs with Brazil, as shown in ﬁgure 3. The data for
Brazil neither fulﬁll the condition (8). In this case there is neither the prevision of a peak
and we can say that the data for Mexico and Brazil reveals a dynamics where the peak seems
to be quite far if it exists. But there are some illustrative cases where the peak is reached.
Progression of the outbreak in Cuba and Iceland are shown in Figure 4 and 5 respectively.
Condition (8) is satisﬁed for both countries and we can see that the curve of infection rate
descends at a good speed after past the peak. Now let us take a look at United States data,
shown in Figure 6. The USA outbreak is characterized by a very fast growth until the peak

6

and, then, very slow decay of the infection rate is evident. As discussed above, the outbreak
will be controlled for almost inﬁnite time in this dynamics. There is also some intermediate
cases as Spain and Italy, shown in Figures 7 and 8. In this case the data exhibits the same
behavior as in USA, a fast initial growth and a very slow decay after the peak. However, the
outbreak is controlled in a ﬁnite amount of time. In Table I we present the relevant ﬁtting
parameters, including herd immunity time, Thi and T1000 , the time to reach a rate of 1000
infections daily. This, for countries that have not reached the epidemic peak, Mexico and
Brazil. We also include the population, P ; of each country.

Table I. Relevant fitting parameters for each country.

As can be seen from ﬁtting coeﬃcients, the exponent b drives the behavior of infections in
every country. Those countries that manage well the disease expansion have b values wide
larger than 1. Countries with b values close to one, as Italy and Spain, have managed the
pandemics but poorly and at high costs. The recovery in both countries will be long. The
same is valid for USA, that manage poorly the outbreak and its struggling with an even
longer recovery to normal life. Even worst scenario is taken place in Mexico and Brazil, with
very low values of b. Those countries are experiencing a big outbreak where even can get
herd immunity. This, however, implies very high values of infections and mortality for the
near future.
But let us brieﬂy comment about herd immunity. Those countries that have managed to
stop the outbreak, even with relative high mortality as Spain and Italy, will not reach the
herd immunity. As a matter of fact, This can not be calculated for those countries. Then,
we can see countries like Brazil where, if the way of deal with the outbreak do not change,
the herd immunity will be reached. Even when it seems desirable, the ability to reach the
herd immunity brings with it a high payload. That is, for a country like Brazil the herd
immunity would charge more than 100 million of infected people. That is, much the same
as if a non small war devastates the country. There is an alike scenario in Mexico, but the
diﬀerence here is that the value for Thi is so high that SARS-CoV-2 could even turn into
a seasonal virus, at least for some years. We can expect around the same mortality but
scattered over a few years.
13

A special observation deserves USA, where Thi tends to inﬁnity. Here we can expect a
continuous infection rate for a very long time. The outbreak is controlled but not enough
to eradicate the virus. Virus will not disappear in several years but maybe the healthcare
system could manage it. The virus will get endemic, and immunity will never be reached.
However the infections and mortality rate associated with it, can be, hypothetically, small
if compared with Mexico and Brazil. We can also compare the speed of the outbreak in
diﬀerent countries. As we already said in Table I we calculated T1000 for some countries.
However, it should be noticed that this time is not calculated from day 0, which is always
January 22, but for the approximated day when the outbreak began in the correspondent
country. By example, in Brazil there was no cases at January, 22 but the ﬁrst cases were
detected around March, 10. So both, data ﬁtting and T1000 , were calculated from March,
10.

CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS

In this work, for the ﬁrst time, we presented a model built using the method of analogy,
in this case with a nonlinear relaxation-like behavior. With this, a good ﬁtting with the observed behavior of the daily number of cases with time is obtained. The explicit expressions
obtained may be used as a tool to approximately forecast the development of the COVID-19
pandemic in diﬀerent countries and worldwide. In principle, this model can be used as a help
to elaborate or change actions. This model does not incorporate any particular property of
this pandemic, so we think it could be used to study pandemics with diﬀerent sources. With
the collected data of the pandemics at early times, using this model, it can be predicted the
possibility of a peak, indeﬁnite growth, time for herd immunity, etc.
What seems to be clear from the COVID-19 data, the ﬁtting and the values shown in
the Table I, is that SARS-CoV-2 is far from being controlled at world level. Even when
some countries appear to control the outbreak, the virus is still a menace for its health
system. Furthermore, in the nowadays interconnected world it is impossible for any country
to keep closed borders and pay attention to what happens only inside. All isolation measures
should be halted at some time and we can expect new outbreaks in countries like Spain or
Italy even after the current one could be controlled. The only way to control the spread of
SARS-CoV-2 seems to be the development of a vaccine that provides the so much desired
14

herd immunity. Indeed, the model made possible to make an approximate forecast of the
time to reach the herd immunity. This may be useful in the design of actions and policies
about the pandemic. We have introduced the T1000 , that gives information about the early
infection behavior in populous countries. A possible improvement of this model is the formal
inclusion of a formulation including the dual conformable derivative [12, 13]. This will be
published elsewhere.
