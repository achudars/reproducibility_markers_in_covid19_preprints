Abstract—Coronavirus or COVID-19, which has been declared pandemic by the World Health Organization, has incurred huge losses
to the lives of people throughout the world. Although, the scientists, researchers and doctors are working round the clock to develop a
vaccine for COVID-19, it may take a year or two to make a safe and effective vaccine available for the world. In current circumstances,
a solution must be developed to control or stop the spread of the virus. For this purpose, a novel technique based on call data record
analysis (CDRA)and contact tracing is proposed that can effectively control the coronavirus outbreak. A positive coronavirus patient
can be traced through CDRA and contact tracing. The technique can track the path traversed by the patient and collect the cell
numbers of all those people who have met with the patient. Keeping in tact the privacy of this group of people, who are contacted
through their cell numbers so that they can isolate themselves till the result of their coronavirus test arrives. If a test result of a person
comes positive among the group, then he/she must be isolated and same CDRA and contact tracing procedures are adopted for that
person. A COVID-19 patient is geo tagged and alerts are sent if any violation of isolation is done by the patient. Moreover, the general
public is informed in advance to avoid the path followed by the patients. This cost effective mechanism is not only capable to control the
coronavirus outbreak but also helps in isolating the patient in his/her house.

I NTRODUCTION

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease,
which is caused by a newly discovered coronavirus [1]. So
far, the disease has spread like a wildfire and almost reached
to the entire world by affecting millions of people [2]. The
most scary side of the disease is that, it is a novel virus
accompanied with unknown myths and realities [3]. Covid19 belongs to a family of ribonucleic acid (RNA), which is
basically a virus family named as coronaviridae [4]. To make
the curve of coronavirus outbreak flatten, the governments
have imposed lockdown in their countries, enforced border
shutdowns and travel restrictions. Consequently, many social and economic sectors are affected such as petroleum
and oil industry [5], agriculture [6], manufacturing industry
[7], education [8], finance industry [9], healthcare and pharmaceutical industry [10], tourism industry [11], real estate
and housing sector [12], sport sector [13], information technology and media industry [14]. Moreover, social distancing
and lockdown measures to control the spread of virus have
caused severe impacts on social life in terms of of domestic
violence, that includes emotional, physical and sexual abuse
[15].

A PREPRINT Oct, 2020.

With the emergence of coronavirus, researchers from all
over the world are actively engaged to find the drug or
vaccine and discover different ways to control its spread.
Since, there is no vaccine or drug available to cure this
deadly disease, therefore, the best solution is to control
the wide spread of the disease by social distancing and
isolation [16]. Currently, the main concern is to minimize
the coronavirus outbreak. In order to control the spread
of the virus, this research work proposes a novel solution
that can track, trace and terminate coronavirus disease by
using call data record analysis (CDRA), which is commonly
known as call detailed record. A call data record is a log file
maintained by the telephone or mobile operators. The log
file contains data such as, duration of calls made or received
at a particular time, source and destination numbers, call
type, international mobile equipment identity (IMEI), cell
site detail, and latitude and longitude of base transceiver
station (BTS) [17].
Almost all law enforcement agencies (LEA) use call data
record (CDR) for tracking, tracing and investigation of criminals [18]. This is one of the most widely used techniques to
cope with the criminals and have shown very promising
results [19]. LEAs use CDR analysis to track and trace the
entire criminal network and find out the hidden connections
between criminals. This paper proposes a technique that assists the governments to track and trace COVID-19 patients
with the help of CDRA in the same manner that is usually
done for criminals. The concern department make it sure to
keep the privacy of a patent in tact. The technique not only
identifies the suspected cases through call data record of a
patient but also it tracks the path followed by the COVID-19
patient.

Fig. 1. Block diagram of the proposed model

One of the main limitations of the CDRA is when a
suspect goes into the crowd without making a phone call.
In order to overcome this limitation contact tracing based on
exposure notification system is used in parallel to track the
path traversed made by the patient without call history [20].
The exposure notifications system (ENS), originally known
as the privacy-preserving contact tracing project, is a framework and specification developed by Apple and Google
to facilitate digital contact tracing during the COVID-19
pandemic [21]. Hence the proposed model is capable to
track and trace COVID-19 patients with and without call
history as shown in Figure 1.
Rest of the paper is organized as follow: Section 2
presents the CDMA framework. Section 3 discusses contact tracing framework. Section 4 presents the conclusive
remarks, potential outcomes of the proposed model, and
some future directions.

CDRA F RAMEWORK

In order to curb the spread of COVID-19, a model is required
that can immediately locate the coronavirus patients by
using the geo location. This type of location can be found
with the help of tower signals and call history of a patient.
If we track, control and isolate, the spread can be controlled
in a few weeks. Otherwise, if we ignore instruction at the
start, it will be an immense damage. This can be easily done
through the CDRA. Through CDRA, one can easily track
the location and call history of a patient and can reach all
possible suspects who met the patient. By doing so, one
can easily stop or minimize the coronavirus outbreak. In
addition, the potential possible carrier should be geo tagged
and tracked by sending alerts if he or she violates quarantine
or self-isolation. This will help the people to isolate themselves and not becoming the source of coronavirus spread.
Detailed flow diagram of the proposed model is shown in
Figure 2
A CDR provides metadata. Metadata is a set of data that
describes and gives information about other data. Such as
how a specific phone number and/or user is utilizing the
phone system. This metadata includes different information
about the call but more relevant information it contained is
summarized in Table 1.
CDRs can also include short messaging services (SMS)
messaging metadata and any other official communications
transmission. However, the contents of the messages/calls
are not revealed through the CDR, thus keeping the privacy

in tact. The call detail record simply shows that the calls or
messages took place, and measures basic call properties. Initially, one has to perform CDR analysis on all those people
who had recently traveled from abroad and could be source
for spreading coronavirus in other people or those whose
results are declared positive. If the patient is diagnosed with
coronavirus, the hospital authorities will inform the government authority to perform CDR analysis on the patient’s
active sim with the consent of patient. After CDRA of a
patient, the concern government team will contact people
with whom the patient might be interacted (these people
are known to be suspected people). Ambulance service will
go to suspected patients’ home and will get sample for
coronavirus. During the process, suspected people will be
guided to stay at their homes or remain isolated until final
result of the test is revealed. If the test comes positive, the
patient will be sent to a hospital. Similar procedure will be
repeated for all those people to whom the patient has been
interacted and their corona test was positive. The potential
outcomes of the proposed model are listed below:
•
•
•
•

tracking of COVID-19 patients,
monitoring of isolated patients,
tracking of suspected ones,
inform the mass about the safest path to use.

Case Study 1

In order to integrate the information and interpret the
outcome of the proposed model, one complete case study
based on fiction is discussed in this section. If the subject’s
corona test comes positive then the very first step is to
quarantine the subject and asked the mobile operator for
his/her CDR. CDRA starts just after getting the CDR from
the mobile operator. After receiving the CDR, it starts in the
format given in Table 2. The table contains the most relevant
attributes of the CDR.
CDR of the subject’s contained all the relevant information through which one can easily track and trace the patient
through his/her cellular contacts along with path followed
by that subject. From CDR, we can get the information
about the calls made and received by the patient along with
date and time. CDR contains the duration of all calls made
and received. CDR includes information about the BTS with
which the subject is connected. CDR also holds the latitude
and longitude of BTS when a call is being made or received.
Before starting the CDR analysis the very first step is to
remove the past irrelevant data. This can be easily done by
deleting all past entries and keeping the data of few couple
of weeks. Doing so, one can easily limit the CDR data in the
desired dates. This will help to analyze the small amount of
data efficiently and accurately. In order to clearly visualize
the data and extract hidden patterns from the CDR, it is
recommended to convert tabular data of CDR into graphical
one. Different tools are available to convert tabular data into
graphical one. One such tool is IBM I2 analyze. This tool
will convert the tabular data into graphical one as shown in
Figure 3.
Nodes in Figure 3 represent the calling parties. While
the frequency of calls are shown through the edges. Node
A represents the subject, while nodes B, C, D, E, F and G

are the one with whom the patient was in contact. From
Figure 3 one can easily interpret that the subject is frequently
in contact with party C, with a total of 80 outgoing calls
and 39 incoming calls. Patient is in least contact with party
G with only 4 outgoing calls and 1 incoming call. While
investigating a COVID-19 patient, Figure 3 depicts a vital
role to memorize the patient with whom he/she has met.
CDR analysis outcomes will help the patient to reduce the
chances to miss anyone with whom the patient has met. In
fact all the parties those were in contact with the patient
will be contacted. It will be confirmed whether they have
met the patient or not. Through CDR of a patient, one can
easily improve the accuracy of tracking and tracing the
suspect ones. After identifying the people who have met
with the patient will be sent into the quarantine. During the
process the suspected people will be guided to stay at their
homes or remain isolated until the final result of the test is
declared. If the test result is positive then the patient will
be sent to hospital. Similar procedure will be adapted to all
those people to whom the patient has been interacted. In
addition to this through CDRA one can easily track the path
followed by the patient using cell site detail and latitude
and longitude. With the help of cell site data and latitude
and longitude of cell site available in Table 2, one can easily
plot the map of the COVID-19 patient using Google map.
Figure 4 shows the Google map plot with the help of cell
site detail given in CDR. This map will be made available
to general public and alerts will be generated to avoid this
path.
After investigating patient A in the light of CDR graphical links. Let suppose patient A admits that during this
period he/she has met with C, D and E. Therefore node
C, D and E will be labeled as suspects as shown in Figure
5. The concerned government department will immediately
contact C, D and E and will ask them to quarantine themselves until and unless their corona tests come negative.
Suppose that after testing the suspect ones, only D comes
positive then this node will be labeled as patient and the
graph will be modified as shown in Figure 6.
Now the entire process will be repeated for node D
i.e., CDRA of node D as shown in Table 3. Its graphical
interpretation is shown in Figure 7.
Google map of the patient node D will be created with
the help of data available in CDR of node D as shown in
Figure 8. The map will be made public with an alert to avoid
the use of this path for couple of weeks.

After investigating node D, one can easily find out
the suspects in the light of CDR graph linkages and path
followed by the patient as shown in Figure 7, 8, respectively.
Similarly, the same cycle will be repeated to dig out the
suspected ones as shown in Figure 9. This process will keep
on repeating until the entire web of patients are traced. All
COVID-19 patients will be geo tagged in order to track their
quarantine and alerts will be generated if he or she violates
isolation.

C ONTACT T RACING F RAMEWORK

Since the proposed model is based on CDR, which only
works once a suspected person made a call and its log is
maintained and tracked. However, in a scenario where a
person who is infected, meet to another person without
having a phone call or go into the crowd, then the model
switches to exposure notifications framework. Exposure
notifications system (ENS) previously known as contact
tracing is a technique in which two nearby mobile devices
exchange random sequence of keys and a log is maintained
in a cloud storage to keep record of all the devices that have
been remained in physical contact previously. This framework is developed by the joint efforts of Google and Apple.
Most importantly this technique protect user’s privacy and
security.
3.1

How it Works?

People all around the world continuously working on developing apps based on exposure notification system to help
them in tracing the people that remained in contact with
infected patients of Covid-19. Once an individual selects
this model, a unique random key of 4 digits generates on
that mobile device. This key is continuously changed after
10 to 20 minutes so that to ensure it cannot be used to
recognize the location. A phone with ENS based app comes
into contact with another device embedded with same app,
both phones exchange these random keys with each other
through bluetooth low energy (BLE) as shown in Figure 10.
This not only ensures the privacy but also improves the
overall power consumption.
User’s phone periodically checks all the random keys
that have been maintained to identify a patient tested positive with COVID-19. If there is a match exists, user and concern government department receive exposure notification
on its phone. In this way one can overcome the limitation
of CDR when a person comes into the contact with another
without having a phone call.

3.2

User Privacy

Privacy always remains at first. In exposure notifications a
user may allow it anytime and can disallow with its own
consent. As discussed above, exposure notifications do not
track location of your device and only works based on BLE.
Exposure notification matching only occurs on the device
and this framework does share identity with other people,
Google, or Apple. Concerned authorities may ask for contact
details but only with the consent of user.
3.3

Case Study 2

In order to integrate the information and interpret the outcome of the proposed model, one complete case study based
on hypothesis is discussed below. Two people named A and
B go to a marketplace at the same time and place. They both
have contact tracing app installed. After the shopping, they
wait for 10 minutes in check out queue. During this time
interval their phones exchange random keys to each other
and store information. Thus they know each other that they
have remained in contact for a while as shown in Figure 11.
After few days, person A feels symptoms of COVID19 and consults a doctor. Unfortunately he is diagnosed
and tested positive for COVID-19. Person A opens up his
app and verifies his documentation provided by health care
provider. He simply taps the button and declares himself
COVID-19 patient as shown in Figure 12. This declaration
automatically uploads on storage cloud once Person A
declares himself COVID-19 patient. After that Person B
phone downloads beacons from all those people who have
been diagnosed with COVID-19. In this way Person B can
quarantine himself or can perform test for COVID-19. Later
if person B diagnoses with COVID-19 he will perform same
steps as person A to declare himself COVID-19 patient as
shown in Figure 13. Similarly, if C was in contact with
number of people without a phone call then the entire log
will be maintained in the same manners as shown in Figure
14.
Hence this model is capable to overcome the tracking limitation of CDR when call is not made. This paper
presents an efficient and robust framework to track COVID19 patients based on CDR and ENS. This model will help
the governments to track, trace and terminate coronavirus
cases by exploring the entire network of COVID-19 patients.
The capabilities of proposed model is summarized in Table

C ONCLUSION

Since there is no vaccine available to cure this pandemic
disease, therefore, the best solution is to minimize its spread.
This paper has proposed a novel model to control the wide
spread of coronavirus using CDRA and contact tracing. The
model proposed in this paper can help to track and trace
the COVID-19 patients. Through this analysis, one can easily
extract the information with whom the patient has remained
in contact. So with CDR analysis one can easily track the
COVID-19 patients and suspects. Through CDRA, we can
easily track the path followed by patients for the last couple
of weeks and alerts can be generated for general public to
avoid that path. The case study section has thoroughly discussed how to implement this model. One of the main limitations of CDRA is when a suspect goes into the crowd without making a phone call. In order to overcome this limitation
contact tracing based on ENS is used in parallel to track the
path traversed made by the patient without call history. The
information extracted with the help of this hybrid model can
easily minimize the wide spread of coronavirus disease. The
potential outcomes of the proposed model are tracking of
COVID-19 patients, monitoring of isolated patients, tracking
of suspected ones and inform the mass about the safest
path to use. It is therefore recommended that the proposed
model can be adopted by the government to control the
wide spread of coronavirus disease. In future, the authors
