Abstract
The origin and early spread of 2019-nCoV is studied by phylogenetic analysis using IC-PIC alignment-free method
based on DNA/RNA sequence information correlation (IC) and partial information correlation (PIC). The topology
of phylogenetic tree of Betacoronavirus is remarkably consistent with biologist’s systematics, classifies 2019-nCoV
as Sarbecovirus of Betacoronavirus and supports the assumption that these novel viruses are of bat origin with
pangolin as one of the possible intermediate hosts. The novel virus branch of phylogenetic tree shows
location-virus linkage. The placement of root of the early 2019-nCoV tree is studied carefully in Neighbor Joining
consensus algorithm by introducing different out-groups (Bat-related coronaviruses, Pangolin coronaviruses and
HIV viruses etc.) and comparing with UPGMA consensus trees.

Several oldest branches (lineages) of the

2019-nCoV tree are deduced that means the COVID-19 may begin to spread in several regions in the world before
its outbreak in Wuhan.

Introduction
Coronaviruses are single-stranded positive-sense enveloped RNA viruses that are distributed broadly among
humans, other mammals, and birds and that cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic diseases [1,2]. The
family Coronaviridae contains 4 genera, namely Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, and

Gammacoronavirus [3]. Six coronavirus species are known to cause human disease [4]. Among which HCoV-OC43,
HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are belong to the genus
Betacoronavirus [5-8]. The other two strains, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, are belong to the genus
Alphacoronavirus [4,5]. In the end of 2019, a pneumonia disease named COVID-19 that caused by 2019-nCoV
(SARS-CoV-2) outbreaks in Wuhan, China and then spread rapidly all over the world. People urgently seek for the
source of transmission and possible intermediate animal vectors. What kind of coronaviruses the SARS-CoV-2 is？
How did the spread of the COVID-19 among humans begin？ Both problems can be solved from the phylogenetic
analysis of the 2019 novel Coronaviruses and other related genomes.
About the first problem the alignment-based sequence analyses reveal many new discoveries [9-11].
Phylogenetic analyses of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein, spike proteins, and full-length
genomes found that the SARS-CoV-2 is most closely related to two bat SARS-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZXC21
and bat-SL-CoVZC45, and the SARS-CoV-2 is thought to belong to Sarbecovirus of Betacoronavirus [12–16]. It was
also found that the SARS-CoV-2 has the highest similarity to the bat coronavirus RaTG13 sampled from a
Rhinolophus affinis bat in Yunnan in 2013 [17, 18]. While bats may be the reservoir host for various coronaviruses,
recent works discovered that the genome of Malayan pangolin coronaviruses shows high similarity to 2019-nCoV
and therefore pangolins (Manis javanica) may be another intermediate host for coronaviruses. [19, 20]. However,
little is known about the second problem. Recently, this problem was warm regarded by researchers Forster et al.
[21] and Yu et al. [22] through phylogenetic network analysis.
About the calculation method used in phylogenetic analysis although the alignment-based approaches often
give high accuracy and may reveal the relationships among sequences, they meet huge challenges when the
recombination, shuffling, and rearrangement events frequently occur in the genome evolution. Simultaneously,
the whole-genome multiple alignments are very time-consuming and expensive in memory usage. However, to
address the limitations of alignment-based approaches the alignment-free genome comparison methods are
becoming attractive alternative [23]. Several approaches derived from information theory, with the emphasize of
base correlation property, have been proposed for sequence comparison [24-27]. The average mutual information
(AMI) profiles were used to group HIV-1 viruses. The base correlation method has been used to infer coronavirus
phylogeny and analysis Hepatitis E virus genotyping and subtyping [25, 26]. Previously, we proposed the IC-PIC
method, and studied the phylogeny of dsDNA viruses, papillomaviruses, parvoviruses in a wide range [27].
Recently, Randhawa et al. [28] and Gao et al.[29] using alignment-free method confirmed that the SARS-CoV-2

belongs to the Betacoronavirus and the genomic similarity to the sub-genus Sarbecovirus infers a possible bat
origin.
With the wide application of genome sequence data we eager to know what is the imprinting characterizing
the characteristics of a genome. We suggested that AMI and k-departed base correlation can be looked as the
signature of a given genome sequence[29]. The average mutual information is called information correlation (IC)
defined by

Dk  2  2 pi log 2 pi   pi ( k ) j log 2 pi ( k ) j
i

ij

and the k-departed base correlation is called partial information correlation (PIC) defined by

Fi ( k ) j  ( pi ( k ) j  pi p j )2
where pi means the probability of base i in the sequence and pi(k)j means the joint probability of base pair ij
departed by distance k (k=0,1,2,…).

In the following we shall study the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny by using IC-PIC

algorithm based on the above set of signatures of the genome sequence .

Materials and Methods
The SARS-CoV-2 genomes used in Figure 1 and Figure 2 to 6 were downloaded from the GISAID (https://gisaid.org)
platform on 2020 February 7 and 29 respectively. Sequences with NNs were discarded. Other sequences were
downloaded from the NCBI database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Note : although the GISAID database now
contains more than five thousands entries, to study the early spread of the SARS-CoV-2 we shall use only 136
genome sequences collected before Feb 29.
The genome sequence is converted into an IC-PIC matrix with 17 rows (representing 1 IC for given k and 16
PICs of different base correlation categories) and d columns (representing the distance k between base pair, k=0,1
to d-1). The only parameter in the algorithm is the range of d, which is denoted as K. K is determined from the

best-fit construction of tree. In general the deduced tree changes with K and attains stable at some large
value. In deducing consensus tree for Beta coronavirus in Fig 1 and for the 2019-nCoV in Fig 2 to 6 we take
K=50 and 100 respectively.
The work is carried out on IC-PIC web server [29]. After uploading input data in fasta format, setting the
parameter K-value and choosing the UPGMA or Neighbor-Joining (NJ) option, the server will run the program and
for each run of given d (d=1 to K stepping 1) deduce a phylogenetic tree. In the calculation the evolutionary

distance of any two genomes is calculated by Euclidean distance between their respective IC-PIC 17Xd matrices.
Then an unrooted UPGMA or NJ tree is generated. Finally, K phylogenetic trees are combined to generate a
consensus tree. All these trees were constructed by using NEIGHBOR and CONSENSE program in the PHYLIP
package [30]. The robustness of the tree topology was estimated by branch support. Note that the NJ tree
obtained by using NEIGHBOR algorithm is unrooted. The placement of the root is one of the most difficult parts of
estimating a tree. However, for gene trees with a known species tree, there is the out-group approach since the
out-group is known for sure or can be assumed appropriately in the present case. In constructing evolutionary
tree for Beta coronavirus we introduce Gamacoronaviruse as out-group. In constructing evolutionary tree for
2019-nCoV we assume several possible out-groups for comparison. Simultaneously, we construct the UPGMA tree
as a supplementary proof of the root of the tree in out-group approach. The biggest difference between NJ tree
and UPGMA tree is that the latter assumes a constant rate of evolution across the lineages i.e., a molecular clock;
because this is often violated in empirical datasets, this approach is usually considered sub-optimal. Another
problem is related to the accuracy in constructing UPGMA tree. Since in UPGMA algorithm we always select a pair
of sequences with the smallest distance to merge, when the difference of the distance of each pair of sequence is
very small and the measurement accuracy of the distance is not enough the wrong pairing in some clades may
occur.

Results
The whole-genome-based phylogenetic trees for Betacoronavirus and 2019-nCoV are deduced by use of IC-PIC
method and given in Fig 1 and Fig 2 to 6 respectively. To reconstruct the phylogenetic tree the sequence data of 40
Betacoronaviruses from five subgenus and 136 SARS-CoV-2 are used. The consensus tree is derived from 50 (K=50
for Fig 1) or 100 (K=100 for Fig 2 to 6) trees based on IC-PIC matric. The robustness of the tree topology was
estimated by branch support but the tree is not drawn to scale.
The phylogenetic tree of Betacoronavirus genus is shown in Fig. 1. From Fig 1 we found: 1) The tree topology
is remarkably consistent with biologist’s systematics that Betacoronavirus contains five subgenus, namely
Sarbecovirus, Hibecovirus, Nobecovirus, Embecovirus and Merbecovirus. Each of these subgenera forms its own
monophyletic clade in the figure. 2) SARS viruses form an early lineage in the subgenus Sarbecovirus. Besides, in
addition to SARS and SARS-like lineages Sarbecovirus includes four other clades, namely, the Bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and
bat-SL-CoVZC45 which jumps out of the clade of SARS-like-CoV, the Pangolin coronaviruses, the clade of RaTG13,

and the 2019-nCoVs. 3) Six Pangolin coronaviruses from Guangxi and from Guangdong form a monophyletic clade
that is different from the phylogenetic tree obtained by Lam et al [19]. 4) Twenty-three SARS-CoV-2 sequences
form a monophyletic group and locate closely with RaTG13. This clade is the newest lineage in Sarbecovirus
subgenus, indicating an independent evolutionary event of 2019-nCoVs in nature. To summarize, the tree topology
well agrees with alignment-based phylogenetic trees. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 belong to the subgenus of
Sarbecovirus and support the assumption that the novel viruses are of bat origin with pangolin as one of the
intermediate hosts.
The phylogenetic trees of 2019-nCoVs are given in Fig 2 to Fig 6. To describe the early spread Fig 2 to 5 are
depicted for 124 SARS-CoV-2 collected in GISAID before February 23, 2020. Then for comparison, in Fig 6 the data
are enlarged to 136 viruses that are collected up to February 29. Since the branching order of IC-PIC tree shows
location-virus linkage, the picture can describe the details of how the disease spreads from one place to another
in principle. Fig 2, Fig 4 and Fig 5 are NJ consensus trees drawn with different orders of input for 2019-nCoV
sequences and different out-groups, namely, with bat SARS-like coronaviruses, Pangolin coronaviruses or HIV
viruses as out-group respectively.
The phylogenetic analyses in Fig 2, Fig 4 and Fig 5 show that the roots of three evolutionary trees are located
in the same place, namely it includes five sequences in Korea (Accession ID : EPI-ISL-412869，412872，412871，
412870，407193)，three in Australia (EPI-ISL-408976, 407893, 408977) , one in Singapore (EPI-ISL-410535), one in
Italy (EPI-ISL-410546), and one in Germany (EPI-ISL-406862). The collection time of these 11 viruses in GISAID is
nearly same, from January 22 to January 31. To give further supplementary evidence on the location of root the
UPGMA tree is constructed and compared with NJ tree. Fig 3 is an example. By using the same order of input of
124 virus sequences as that in Fig 2, we found the root of UPGMA tree in Fig 3 is basically same as NJ tree.
However, there exist some errors. For example, two sequences USA/CA6 and Shenzhen/SZTH-001 mistakenly
enter the root region in Fig 3. This may be caused by the error of distance input in UPGMA algorithm.
Furthermore, to study the possible change of the root place as the virus data have been enlarged we construct
NJ consensus tree of 136 sequences. As given in the example in Fig 6, we found the root of the tree is still
distributed in three regions of Korea, Australia and Europe as in Fig 2. There are totally 16 virus genomes in root
region and the newly added ones are obviously the second generation of the roots in Fig 2.
We notice that the phylogenetic tree in Fig 2, Fig 4 and Fig 5 shows the nearly same topology although the
different out-groups have been used. In addition to the same root, there is a common top branch on three trees,

about 35 sequences representing Wuhan outbreak of COVID-19. Below it there are a branch of about 18
sequences composed mainly of USA COVID events, a branch of Japan COVID events and a complex network of
SARS-CoV-2 in south China, Hong Kong, Singapore and other cities. All these branches are derived from the root
of the phylogenetic tree. Finally, it is worth noting that although nearly half virus infection events (GISAID, before
February 2019) happened in Wuhan and China, none of them entered in the root region of the phylogenetic tree
( Figure 2 and Figure 4 to 6).

We know that the collection of GISAID only began in December 24, 2019. If more

early data are collected we will be able to obtain a more complete conclusion. However, in spite of the
incompleteness of the early GISAID data it is reasonable to assume that the novel virus has crept into humans
before its outbreak in Wuhan, begun to spread in root regions. As for why the same virus suddenly occurred and
spread rapidly in areas with different geographical locations, it is obviously related to the globalization of economy
and social interaction. Therefore, early effective prevention and control of epidemics must rely on international
cooperation.

Summary
The alignment-free IC-PIC method based on DNA/RNA sequence information correlation and partial information
correlation is an effective tool for the reconstruction of phylogenetic tree. We confirm current taxonomic
classification of the 2019-nCoV as Sarbecovirus sub-genus within Betacoronavirus through alignment-free
comparative genomics with IC-PIC method (Fig 1). The obtained IC-PIC tree supports the assumption that the
2019-nCoV is of bat origin with pangolin as one of the possible intermediate hosts. Moreover, the IC-PIC tree of
2019-nCoV (Fig 2 to 6) can give the details of the early spreading of diseases. Through the root placement in NJ
consensus trees of early viruses by introducing different out-groups and comparing with UPGMA trees several
oldest clades of the tree can be deduced that means the COVID-19 may begin to spread in these locations before
its outbreak in Wuhan. Moreover, this discovery provides a clue to searching for the origin of COVID-19. If there
are some mammals being intermediate host of the 2019-nCoV one should search for it first in the location of
these evolutionary oldest clades.
