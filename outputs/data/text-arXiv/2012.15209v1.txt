We have studied the dynamic evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic in Argentina. The marked
heterogeneity in population density and the very extensive geography of the country becomes a
challenge itself. Standard compartment models fail when they are implemented in the Argentina
case. We extended a previous successful model to describe the geographical spread of the AH1N1
influenza epidemic of 2009 in two essential ways: we added a stochastic local mobility mechanism, and we introduced a new compartment in order to take into account the isolation of infected
asymptomatic detected people. Two fundamental parameters drive the dynamics: the time elapsed
between contagious and isolation of infected individuals (α) and the ratio of people isolated over the
total infected ones (p). The evolution is more sensitive to the p−parameter. The model not only
reproduces the real data but also predicts the second wave before the former vanishes. This effect
is intrinsic of extensive countries with heterogeneous population density and interconnection.The
model presented here becomes a good predictor of the effects of public policies as, for instance, the
unavoidable vaccination campaigns starting at present in the world.

INTRODUCTION

The pandemic of 2020 has changed life in many respects. In the scientific community there have been an
increased interest in all the issues related to this phenomenon. More than 23500 articles published containing the word Covid19 this year account for this fact.
There are studies on the medical and biological aspects
of the virus, the mechanisms of contagion, the strategies
to avoid the spread of the disease, the recommendations
of health authorities to prevent infection as to keep a
respectable distance for others, the use of masks, washing hands profusely and frequently, sanitizing shoes and
utensils, and compulsory test and tracking techniques [1].
Total confinement has been applied since the 14th century [2], it is obviously effective because no personal contact means no infection spread, but this option is not
realizable in the modern societies for a long period of
time. A recent action that has proved useful is to detect
not only infected, but also asymptomatic people by random testing and isolate the ones that come out positive
[3].
When a new virus emerges, and there is no effective
treatment or vaccine, these non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) constitute the main response option for
mitigating the effects of the pandemic. Search - based on

observational data and mathematical models - has been
done to identify effective NPIs, one of them is quarantine, and its effectiveness increases when applied early in
the pandemic and in combination with other NPIs [4, 5].
Active search for infected people who are asymptomatic
or present mild symptoms and subsequent isolation was
not included in the above mentioned research, probably
because few countries had implemented it. However, for
SARS-Cov-2, a great proportion of infected people are
asymptomatic or present mild symptoms [6, 7], they are
not quarantined, still they remain infectious until they
are recovered [8]. More research is needed to further assess the effect of this kind of procedure Then, it becomes
necessary to model the spread of the pandemic in this situation and compare it with predictions without infected
asymptomatic people detection.
Compartmental models have been extended to include
quarantined individuals [9–12]. Although time dependent parameters have been used to simulate people’s mobility [13], most of the implementations do not include
the actual geographical spread, assuming in general homogeneous populations and equally probable interactions
among individuals. However, when modeling pandemics,
demographic heterogeneity, and people mobility could be
a key element to be considered. In particular, human mobility is strongly affected by governments’ policies and it

2
is almost imperative to include this feature in order to
render simulations closer to the real data.
We propose here a model in which the noisy interactions of human society and the inhomogeneities of geographical spread are taken into account. We use an
extension of a model proposed in Ref. [14] to predict the
influence of these measures of detection and subsequent
isolation. The original model has been extremely successful in predicting the behavior of Covid-19 in various countries, as different in all respects as Mexico, Finland, and
Iceland [15]. The dynamic works in two scales: On the
one side a micro or local one in which the disease spread
follow a (almost) standard compartmental evolution. It
contains the biology-related parameters of the disease.
On the other side, a macro or long range dynamics, which
describes the geographical interconnection in a given region or country. However, the implementation as in [15]
was surprisingly inaccurate for the Argentina case. To
understand this singular behavior we have to give more
versatility to the model by incorporating the influence of
detecting and isolating infected asymptomatic persons as
well as to account for local stochastic mobility.
In the next Section we describe the model in detail,
then we explain how it is applied to the Argentina case,
and then present some results from numerical calculations. Finally we conclude with some important remarks.

infectious (I), isolated in quarantine (Q), and deaths or
recovered while acquired immunity lasts (Z). After the
immunity period, people could be again susceptible to the
disease according to the survival parameter S. Incubation period (), infectiousness period (σ ) and immunity
period (ω) are parameters depending on the specific disease studied and host’s immune response. Two new parameters are added to the model: α - the time lapse from
infection to detection and isolation of infected individuals, and p - the proportion of infected people detected and
put in quarantine, either symptomatic or asymptomatic.
All time parameters are assumed to be constant and dimensionless by expressing them in units of a time scale
of one day.

THEORETICAL MODEL

The approach is based on a collection of SEIR models
acting in cells distributed along (and filling) the whole
geography of the country. The network is weighted by
the population density of each cell. Connections between cells are realized by the national ground and/or
air roads. This approach has the advantage that the parameters proper to the disease (only in the SEIR part of
the model) are separated from the ones related to spreading infections between people, which ultimately translate
into mobility quantities between cells.

Local dynamics: SEIQR stochastic model
(Mycrodinamics)

The SEIR model of Ref. [14] was converted into a
SEIQR stochastic model in order to analyse the influence of detection and isolation of infected people. This
was done by adding a quarantine compartment, Q. Fig.
1 shows a diagram of the five-compartmental model: susceptible individual (X), exposed yet not infectious (E),

FIG. 1. Compartment scheme of a SEIQR model. , α, σ
and ω are the latency, isolation, infectiousness and immunity
periods, p is the portion of infected people which is isolated
and S is the survival parameter.

Demography is added using a constant mortality rate
µ=1/L, where L is life expectancy. The total population
N = X + E + Y + Q + Z depends only on the survival
parameter S; at time zero X = N . In order to keep N
fixed, the birth rate is considered a constant (N µ) and
all the newborns are included in the susceptible compartment. Since we assume that the disease is spread due to
daily contacts, we consider that the dynamical evolution
of the model should be given in discrete steps of one day,
which is the time unit of all the delay parameters.
With all these assumptions, the discrete SEIQR model
could be written as discrete mathematical map with five
variables,

where Gt is the incidence function evaluated at time t.
Assuming a homogeneously mixed population within a
cell, the probability of getting infected is calculated using the Poisson probability distribution; then the incidence rate is given by: Gt = Xt (1 − e−βYt ), where β is
a transmission parameter that characterizes the intrinsic
behavior of the disease and it is a dimensionless constant
for a specific infection. We assume Gt = 0 for t < 1.
A model of this type is acting in each cell of the geographical region of interest. The described system of
equations is deterministic. However, since people move
not only to fixed places, following daily routine activities, but also may go to nearby unpredictable places,
random mobility within a cell should also be considered
[16], which we denote as local mobility. This is done by
adding a threshold parameter vL , between 0 and 1, that
accounts for people’s short distance mobility. Each day
t, in every geographical cell with coordinates (i; j), we
compare a random number (r, from uniform probability
distribution between 0 and 1) with this threshold parameter. If vL < r the systems keeps its normal evolution
but, if vL > r we regard that the mobility was low so
that the disease didn’t evolve; under this circumstance,
in this area, there are not new infected people during this
day.
Geographical disease spreading (Macrodynamics)

A realistic model of epidemics most include its geographical spread in big regions or counties with heterogeneous population densities. For this purpose, the map
of the country under study is divided in a two dimensional grid of squares of size of a few km2 . For each
cell of coordinates (i; j), the actual population density
ρ(i; j) is known. Within each cell population is normalized to N = 1, local dynamics is simulated by a SEIQR
stochastic model using the incidence function weighed by
its population density:
Gt (i, j) = Xt (i, j)ρ(i, j)(1 − e−βYt (i,j) ),

(7)

To consider the spread among first neighbor regions we
use a Metropolis Monte-Carlo algorithm. For each square
in the grid, if Yt (i, j) ≤ η and νn < r, there is propagation
of the disease to a neighbor cell. The value η is related to

the infectiousness of the disease and νn varies between 0
and 1 and accounts for the mobility between neighbors.
r is a random number given by a uniform distribution
between 0 and 1. To start the disease in a new cell of
coordinates (i, j+1), which is one first neighbor of the cell
(i, j), the initial conditions are given by Yt (i, j + 1) = η
and Xt (i, j + 1) = 1 − η. The disease can also be spread
randomly to distant regions because of people traveling
between connected cities. Another Metropolis MonteCarlo algorithm is used for long distance new infections,
either by road or by air. It is more likely that bigger cities
are infected first because they are more populated and
connected. Because of this, the long distance mobility
parameter νa is weighed by the normalized densities of
both, origin and destiny cells. In this case propagation
occurs between a cell already infected (Yt (i, j) ≤ η) and
a cell connected to the first one by air, trains or national
routes. If νa ρ(i, j)ρ(m, n) < r, (with r a random number
from a uniform probability distribution between 0 and 1)
the cell at the new coordinates (m,n) starts the disease
with initial conditions Yt (m, n) = η and Xt (m, n) = 1−η.

Finally, since people move in an essentially random
way it is possible to find people travelling to distant cities
or even isolated towns with lower population densities.
This is accounted for by the noise parameter KT representing the ”kinetic energy” of the system. In this case a
new Monte-Carlo algorithm is applied. For each cell with
coordinates (i, j) with ρ(i, j) > T , (with T a normalized
population density threshold), if e−1/KT < r, then the
disease will start at the cell (i, j) with initial conditions
Yt (m, n) = η and Xt (m, n) = 1 − η.

In this model β does not depend on ρ and/or on mobility of people as in traditional SEIR models. ρ is considered constant throughout the pandemic, and mobility parameters can be used to reflect measures applied
by different governments trying to control the pandemic.
Another advantage of this model is that since detected
individuals, and therefore reported, are clearly separated
from non-reported asymptomatic ones, the model traces
both groups, an important point in the case of SARSCoV-2 where there are so many asymptomatic people.

4
APPLICATION OF THE MODEL TO COVID-19
IN ARGENTINA

In order to apply these ideas to the case of Argentina
we have divided the country’s territory in a grid of around
67000 squares of 7 km × 7 km. The total population
inside of each parcel was assigned from the data provided
by the National Geographic Institute of Argentina (IGN).
The interconnection between cities by commercial flights
was canceled by public policies since the early days of
the pandemic. Consequently, only land connections are
possible. Therefore, we allow traveling (both, short and
large distances) across the network of roads and routes
also provided by the IGN.

model. The information to create the maps was provided by
the IGN. Each pixel corresponds to a 7 km x 7 km parcel

Fitting parameters to Argentina

It is important to remark that in this model the disease
parameters are well separated from those that account
for the social distancing and mobility. Since there is not
much information about latency, infectiousness and immune periods of COVID-19, and this values could vary
significantly from person to person, one can fit this values to the actual data within upper and lower thresholds
found in the literature [17].
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Argentina
was a person coming from abroad on March 3th, 2020.
And, in general, the disease evolution during the first
20 days was because of infected people coming from Europe and USA and not because of community spread.
On March 20th a strict lock-down started all around the

country and mobility was drastically reduced. Because
of this, disease parameters cannot be fitted straight from
Argentina data. In this sense we decided to use the same
parameters as in México, Iceland and Finland models
[15]:  = 1, σ = 14 and β = 0.91. ω was conservatively chosen as 140 days because the center for disease
control and prevention (CDC) states that there are no
reports of people being reinfected within 5 months of
first infection[17] . σ is set to the quarantine standard
time used in several countries (Argentina among them).
At present, there are scarcely any available studies in Argentina to sure how much infected people is detected and
put in quarantine (quantified in our model by the p− parameter). One particular study in urban slum dwellers of
Buenos Aires City suggests that only 10% of the actually
infected peoples was PCR tested and nearly 90% were
asymptomatic cases [18]. Patients are tested only when
presents two or more concurrent symptoms and, in the
case of a positive result, all of the close contacts are isolated independently of new tests. Since some studies suggest that most COVID-19 patients have mild symptoms
or are asymptomatic [19–21], we estimate that tested and
isolated cases in Argentina are between 10% and 20% of
the actual number of infected people, i.e. 0.1 ≤ p ≤ 0.2.
These values are similar in order of magnitude to those
found in Spain and France [6, 8]. To estimate α we use
the information provided by the Health Ministry of Argentina for each patient. From this data, we found that
80% of the people start the isolation between 3 and 7
days after they get infectious although mostly at 5 days.
Since this is a mean value model, we decided to use 5 as
a good estimation. Conservatively, we choose the values
p = 0.1 and α = 5 to study the evolution of the pandemic
in Argentina.
For simplicity, mobility parameters are regarded equal
νa =νl =νn =ν. Consequently they change on time in the
same way. Since mobility has drastically reduced during
the first stages of the pandemic, the noise was considered
very low taking a value KT = 0.1. We take four intervention times to account for the changes in the stringency of
the government measures. This intervention dates were
fitted with a delay of around 7-8 days with the real implementation dates because we noticed that this is, in
average, the time taken by a measure to impact in the
growth rate of the pandemic. The government measures
are described in Table I
The η parameter was fixed to 10−5 , which corresponds
to start the disease in a city with at least 10 infected
people.
Finally, considering a 2.7% case fatality rate, we set the
survival parameter to S = 0.9973 (fatality rate depends
on the amount of tested cases).

After a massive strike the pandemic evolution raised consistently.
The lock down started to be lifted.
Most restrictions were gradually lifted. The pandemic spread over all the country.

Comparison with reported data

In Fig. 3 we show the result of this model obtained
from adding the newly isolated people from all the cells
in the grid scaled by each region’s own population. This
plot is obtained by averaging 100 model runs. We should
keep in mind that most governments are not able to detect all the actual COVID-19 cases but a fraction p and
that only the confirmed and isolated people should be
compared with the data provided by official sources.
In order to understand Fig. 3, three points should be
kept in mind. First one is that the mobility parameter
from day 166 onward was fixed to 0.358. This means that
this prediction will be adequate as long as the people
keeps respecting social distancing measures. It should
be regarded that if all the mobility and group meeting
restrictions are lifted the evolution will be different. The
second topic to consider is the appearance of a second
pandemic wave. This wave is strongly related with the

immunity period which was fixed at 140 days. Since there
is not enough data available at this time it is possible that
this second wave appears a few weeks earlier or later.
Obviously, this dynamic will be dramatically different if
a campaign of massive vaccination occurs.
The third issue to notice is that, as it is expected, the
infected are 10 times higher than the isolated as it can
be observed by comparing figures (A) and (B) or (C) and
(D). At the current transmission rate, this implies that
by the end of 2021 the pandemic will have infected a
number of people equivalent to the country’s population.
If we compute fatalities as the 0.027% of the infected,
we can predict that there will be 116.000 deaths by the
beginning of 2022.
In order to study how the p and α parameters affect the
evolution of the pandemic, we analyzed different combinations of them and fixing the values of ν as in the Table
I. Firstly, we study the model by varying α. Figure 4
shows the curves obtained from 100 runs of the model
for p = 0.1 and different values of α. As it is clear from
the figure, the early discovery of a case reduces the height
and the width of the peak in (A) and (B) but not in a
significant way. This can be seen clearly in the curves
(E) and (F) were the accumulated isolated and infected
cases in 600 days are shown. The expected difference between early and late case discovery for p = 0.1 is around
8%, which is within the spread of the model. The value
taken by α could become more significant for bigger p
but, as we have seen before, the fraction of discovered
and isolated people is small in most countries.
Next we studied the variation of the fraction of isolated
people, p. The results can be seen in Figure 5. It is clear
from the figures (D) and (F) that the accumulated infected are smaller for smaller p.This result is reasonable
since the higher the fraction of discovered infected people, the smaller is the population that continues to infect
others reducing the spread of the pandemic. This shows
that the implementation of an efficient COVID-19 tracking and testing program could be of great significance to
control its evolution.
Figures 5 (C) and 5 (E) show the number of accumulated infected cases. In this case, as the number of discovered cases raises, the infected population decreases leaving a smaller pool of people with the virus to be found.

Therefore, once that more than 40 % of those infected
are discovered, a decrease in the number of isolated cases
is observed as a consequence of the reduction in the total
diseased population. It is interesting to notice that, for
the same parameters and mobility, we found that the total accumulated infected cases in 600 days is 57% smaller
for p = 0.6 than for p = 0.1. This would imply a reduction in the expected fatalities to less than 50.000.
We want to highlight the use of this new model to
accurately describe the geographical spread of the pandemic in the Argentinean territory. From all the figures
it can be clearly seen that, without any government measures as mobility reductions, effective infectious tracking
or vaccines, the disease is not expected to disappear by
itself. The model also predicts the appearance of a second wave before the end of the first one. This is a direct
consequence of the geographical extension of the territory
and the stochasticity of the model. When the pandemic
starts in a certain region of the country also diminishes
in another area at the same time (see figure 6). In this

way, the disease oscillates between different regions delayed in time. Consequently, it never completely stops
or vanishes. The ∼50-day elapsed between maxima are
very close to that actually seen in the official data. The
illness started mainly in the metropolitan area of Buenos
Aires (AMBA), which concentrates almost 33% of the
population of Argentina. After several months of evolution, the pandemic moved to other important urban areas
of the country as Córdoba, Santa Fe, Rı́o Negro, Mendoza, Chaco, etc., and started diminishing in the AMBA
region. The great mobility between these areas will eventually create a new peak in the AMBA region once the
immunity period is finished for most of its population.
This kind of geographic behaviour can also be seen in
countries like USA, Brazil and Mexico because they have
big territories with several important urban areas. As
an example, USA had its first cases peaks in the North
east states during April and then the pandemic moved to
south western states where the cases peaks where on July.
Because of this it never experienced an overall decrease

in the amount of cases as in most European countries
and, as a consequence, they are facing the second wave
in states like New York without reaching the end of the
first wave in other states.

CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have proposed a novel model to study
the influence of geographical and sociological conditions
on the spread of the virus SARS-Cov2, causing the Covid19 pandemic in Argentina.
We introduce two fundamental parameters: α, the
time elapsed between contagious and isolation of infected individuals, and p, the ratio of people isolated over
the total infected ones. The results show clearly that
the detection and consequent isolation of infected people are crucial to the dynamics of the virus propagation
(p−sensitivity) while the time lasted between infection
and isolation is not a relevant issue (α−insensitivity).
We also introduced local mobility into the model to account for random social behavior within each cell. This
allowed a better prediction of the pandemic evolution
and enabled the appearance of new features that were
actually observed in real data. For instance, the model
predicts new waves whose period depends mainly on the
immunity time parameter (ω). This feature was already
observed in European countries where the second wave
appeared and reinfection was observed. Moreover, the
model shows an interesting behavior in countries with a
wide geographic span and high mobility. The new daily
cases are expected to come from different regions at different moments as the pandemic evolves. This creates
unsynchronized oscillations of the daily case curves for
different areas and prevents the disease from being com-

pletely eradicated. In order to stop this kind of behavior,
a better control of the mobility between distant regions
should be adopted. Testing and quarantine policies already embraced in some countries could prevent the appearance of new infectious foci.
As final remarks, we want to emphasize the importance
of tracking and isolating infected people. In this sense,
countries as Iceland and South Korea have shown the
effectiveness of these methods to reduce the pandemic
spread [15, 22]. On the other hand, cultural habits and
social behavior have shown to be important factors as
well. The increase in the number of cases because of the
mobility growth was clearly demonstrated in the fitted
ν parameters. With this in mind, social distancing measures and case tracking are two key factors to contain the
pandemic evolution. Furthermore, as this model shows
robustness as a global predictor in a very extensive and
heterogeneously connected country like Argentina, we are
confident that it gives strong support to analyze vaccination strategies for the future mitigation of the disease.
