Abstract

Mass public quarantining, colloquially known as a lock-down, is a non-pharmaceutical intervention to
check spread of disease. This paper presents ESOP (Epidemiologically and Socio-economically Optimal
Policies)1 , a novel application of active machine learning techniques using Bayesian optimization, that
interacts with an epidemiological model to arrive at lock-down schedules that optimally balance public
health benefits and socio-economic downsides of reduced economic activity during lock-down periods. The
utility of ESOP is demonstrated using case studies with VIPER (Virus-Individual-Policy-EnviRonment),
a stochastic agent-based simulator that this paper also proposes. However, ESOP is flexible enough to
interact with arbitrary epidemiological simulators in a black-box manner, and produce schedules that
involve multiple phases of lock-downs.
Disclaimer: This paper makes no recommendation to individuals and its results should not be interpreted
by individuals to modulate personal behavior. The authors recommend that individuals continue to follow
guidelines offered by local governments with respect to lock-downs and social distancing, and those offered
by medical professionals with respect to personal hygiene and treatment.

Introduction

Infectious diseases that are contagious pose a threat to public safety once they attain pandemic status. Several
historical instances of such pandemics have taken a heavy toll on human lives. Prominent examples include
the H1N1 (Spanish flu) pandemic of 1918 (> 50 million fatalities), the H3N2 (HongKong flu) pandemic of
1968 (≈ 1 million fatalities), the HIV/AIDS pandemic (≈ 32 million fatalities) [Kimball and Bose, 2020], the
novel influenza-A H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic of 2009 (≈ 0.3 million fatalities) [Roos, 2012], and the ongoing
CoViD-19 pandemic (≈ 0.4 million fatalities as of writing this document) [WHO, 2020].
In such situations, and especially in the absence of vaccines and antiviral treatments, experts often
prescribe guidelines to public such as hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, as well as two kinds of nonpharmaceutical interventions, namely 1) mitigation policies such as human surveillance and contact tracing,
and 2) suppression policies such as social distancing or its more extreme form colloquially known as a lockdown [Aledort et al., 2007]. However, their benefits with respect to public health outcomes notwithstanding,
severe and extended applications of suppression policies such as lock-downs negatively impact livelihoods
and the economy. For instance, Scherbina [2020] estimates the cost of extensive suppression measures to the
US economy at $9 trillion, or about 43% of its annual GDP.
Peak et al. [2017] demonstrate the need for policy decisions to balance suppression and mitigation measures in terms of the epidemiological characteristics of the pandemic, pointing out that suppression measures

hold most benefit for fast-course diseases whereas effective mitigation measures may suffice for others at much
less socio-economic cost. This points to a need for techniques that can take the disease progression characteristics of a certain outbreak and suggest policies that optimally use suppression and mitigation techniques
to offer acceptable health outcomes as well as socio-economic risks within acceptable limits. In fact there is
an emerging area variously termed “economic epidemiology” or “epidemiological economics” Perrings et al.
[2014] that seeks to develop models that can address the interplay of disease and host behavior.

Related Works

Several works exist on modelling epidemic and pandemic progressions using differential equation-based models such as SIR or SEIR and using them to make predictions. Some examples include [Efimov and Ushirobira,
2020, Lyra et al., 2020, Sardar et al., 2020, Vyasarayani and Chatterjee, 2020]. Most of these studies utilize
differential equation-based models such as SIR and SEIR variants. This paper instead uses a stochastic
agent-based model called VIPER that is proposed in Sec 2. The reason behind this choice was to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques when working with epidemiological models that are not
described compactly using a few equations and thus, harder to analyze.
Micro-simulation studies using UK [Ferguson et al., 2020] and Indian [Singh and Adhikari, 2020] data
conclude that multiple short-term suppression rounds may offer acceptable health outcomes when a single
extended period of suppression is infeasible. However, these works do not offer ways to find either the optimal
moment to initiate suppression measures or their duration.
This is important since Morris et al. [2020], Patterson-Lomba [2020] show that the optimal initiation point
and duration of a suppression may depend substantially on the disease and social characteristics themselves
(for instance the disease incubation period and the basic reproduction number R0 ). This is understandable
since premature suppression would slow down the depletion of the pool of susceptible individuals leaving
room open for a second wave of infections whereas delayed suppression may cause the initial wave to be
widespread in itself. Scherbina [2020] additionally considers the economic impact of these measures and
suggests durations for lock-down periods and their associated economic costs in medical expenses as well as
lost value of statistical life.
Prior works offering actual policy advice fall into two categories: 1) those that offer only broad principles
on how to target interventions e.g. by identifying simple rules of thumb [Wallinga et al., 2010], and 2) those
that do offer actionable advice e.g. when to initiate suppression [Klepac et al., 2011, Morris et al., 2020,
Torre et al., 2019, Zhao and Feng, 2019]. However, the latter often do not take the socio-economic impact
of these measures into account and moreover, consider only simple theoretical models e.g. SIR that are not
very expressive.
A subclass of the latter approaches [for example, Bussell et al., 2019] advocate first fitting an approximate
model to the actual simulator (to make it simple enough to enable mathematical analyses) before applying
optimal control strategies. Such approximations may introduce unmodelled errors into the prediction pipeline
and adversely affect their outcome. ESOP instead directly models intervention outcomes in terms of the
simulator outputs.

Our Contributions

This paper presents ESOP (Epidemiologically and Socio-economically Optimal Policies), a system that uses
Bayesian optimization to automatically suggest suppression policies that optimally balance public health
and economic outcomes. ESOP interacts with epidemiological and economic models to automatically suggest policy decisions. The paper also presents VIPER (Virus-Individual-Policy-EnviRonment), an iterative,
stochastic agent-based model (ABM) with which case studies are conducted to showcase the utility of ESOP.
We note however, that ESOP can readily interact with other epidemiological models, e.g. those that incorporate stratification based on region and age e.g. INDSCI-SIM [Shekatkar et al., 2020], COVision [Nagori
et al., 2020], ABCS [Harsha et al., 2020] and IndiaSim [Megiddo et al., 2014]. Although machine learning techniques have been used in epidemiological forecasting [Lindström et al., 2015] and estimating model

VIPER: An Iterative Stochastic Agent-based Epidemiological
Model

VIPER (Virus-Individual-Policy-EnviRonment) models an in-silico population of individuals, supports compartments of the SEIR model [Keeling and Rohani, 2008], and allows travel and quarantining of individuals.
Being an ABM rather than an ODE-based model, VIPER can model disease progression within each individual separately and thus, quarantine or expire individuals based on their stage of the disease, something that
is difficult to do in ODE-based models. Stochastic ABMs allow diverse socio-medico-economic traits to be
modeled at the individual level but cannot be easily represented by a concise system of ODEs. Thus, works
such as [Morris et al., 2020] do not apply here.
Details of the VIPER model are described below and succinctly enumerated in Tab 1. VIPER consists
four sub-models, one each devoted to modelling individuals, the virus, environment parameters and policy
parameters.
Individual Model : an individual is characterized by their susceptibility to infection (SUS), resistance to
disease progression (RST), viral load (VLD), recovery load (RLD), current state (STA), quarantine status
(QRN) and location (X,Y). SUS, RST, VLD DLD, X and Y are real numbers between 0 and 1, whereas
QRN takes Boolean values. The state of an individual STA can be either S (susceptible), E (exposed), I
(infectious), R (recovered) or X (expired/deceased). Individuals are initialized with random values for RST,
SUS and their location within the 2-D box [0, 1]2 . Individuals progress from state S → E → I, can be
optionally quarantined while in state I, and then move to either state R or X.
Viral Model : the virus is characterized by its incubation period (INC), the base viral load in an individual
at the end of the incubation period (BVL), the disease progression rate (DPR), the viral load over which
an individual’s chances of getting expired start increasing (XTH) and the base removal probability of an
individual with viral load at XTH (BXP). BVL, DPR, XTH and BXP are real numbers between 0 and 1
whereas INC is a natural number.
Environment Model : the environmental factors are modeled using the typical contact radius between
individuals (BCR), the probability that a contact between an infectious and susceptible individual will lead
to a successful infection (BIP), the fraction of the population that travels at any time instant (BTR), the
3

maximum distance to which they travel (BTD), and the fraction of population that is infected with the virus
at start of the simulation (INI). All these values are represented as real numbers between 0 and 1.
Policy Model : the policy model comprises the viral load over which an individual’s chances of getting
quarantined start increasing (QTH) and the base quarantining probability of an individual with viral load
at QTH (BQP). Both are real numbers between 0 and 1. Additionally, the policy prescribes a lock-down
level which is a real number between 0 and 5. The lock-down level is specified at every time instant t of the
simulation. A lock-down level of l at a certain time instant causes BTD as well as BCR to go down by a
factor of exp(−l). Thus, at a high lock-down level, individuals are neither able to travel much, nor interact
with other individuals far off from their current location.
Modelling disease-progression dynamics in VIPER : The viral load (VLD) of an individual represents
the extent of infection within their system. At the end of the incubation period (INC), an exposed individual
always has a “base” viral load of BVL. The virus attempts to increase this viral load according to the disease
progression rate (DPR) whereas the individual resists this according to their resistance level (RST) by
converting viral load to recovery load (RLD). Disease progression in every infected individual is governed by
an SIR-like model with
d VLD(t)
= −RST · VLD(t) + DPR · (1 − VLD(t) − RLD(t))
dt
and

d RLD(t)
= RST · VLD(t)
dt
Thus, VIPER allows individuals to experience disease progression, as well as associated effects like quarantining or expiry, in a completely individualized manner, something that is readily possible in agent-based
models but much more difficult to express in terms of a compact set of differential equations.
An infected individual whose VLD falls below BVL moves on to state R, i.e. recovers. An individual
with VLD equal to QTH (resp. XTH) has a probability BQP (resp. BXP) of getting quarantined (resp.
expired). An individual with VLD greater than QTH has the following probability of getting quarantined
P [quarantine] = BQP + (1 − BQP) ·

VLD − QTH
,
1 − QTH

i.e. the probability of getting quarantined increases linearly to 1 as the individual’s VLD goes up. At every
time step t, a coin is tossed for all individuals with VLD greater than QTH which lands heads with this
particular probability. If the coin does indeed land heads, the individual is deemed quarantined. Note that
this allows VIPER to model asymptomatic transmission since it allows individuals with low VLD levels (esp.
below QTH) to avoid detection with high probability but makes it difficult for those in advanced stages of
the disease to avoid quarantine.
Similarly, an individual with VLD greater than XTH has the following probability of getting expired
P [expiry] = BXP + (1 − BXP) ·

VLD − XTH
.
1 − XTH

At every time step, a coin is similarly tossed to decide on whether an individual with VLD greater than XTH
gets expired or not. The lock-down level needs to be specified at every time instant t of the simulation. A
lock-down level of l(t) causes BTD as well as BCR at that time t to go down by a factor of exp(−l(t)). Thus,
at high lock-down levels, individuals are neither able to travel much, nor have contact with other individuals
far off from their current location. The lock-down level has no effect on the quarantining or expiry processes
described above which continue the same way irrespective of the lock-down level.

ESOP: Epidemiologically and Socio-economically Optimal Policies

ESOP encodes interventions as vectors and their health and socio-economic outcomes as functions, e.g., the
coordinates of a 2-D vector x = [x1 , x2 ] ∈ N2 may encode the starting point (x1 ) and duration (x2 ) of
a lock-down. Next, consider a function fepi : N2 → [0, 1] encoding health outcomes with fepi (x) equal to
the peak infection rate (the largest fraction of the total population infected at any point of time) if the
intervention x is applied. Similarly, let feco : N2 → [0, 1] encode economic outcomes with feco (x) being the
fraction of population that would face unemployment if lock-down were indeed to last x2 days. We stress that
the functions fepi , feco described here are examples and other measurable outcomes, e.g. cumulative death
rate, loss to GDP, can also be used. Predicted estimates for fepi would be obtained from epidemiological
simulators such as INDSCI-SIM or IndiaSim (we will use VIPER) and those for feco would be obtained from
economic models. Our goal is to balance health and economic outcomes by solving the following optimization
problem:
x∗ := arg min2 f (x) where f (x) = fepi (x) + feco (x)
x∈N

However, it is challenging to perform this optimization using standard descent techniques [Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004] since even obtaining values of the function f at specific query points (let alone gradients)
is expensive as it involves querying simulators such as VIPER. An acceptable solution in this case is Bayesian
optimization [Jones et al., 1998] which is an active machine learning technique used to optimize functions
which are expensive to evaluate and to which, moreover we do not have access to gradients.
Fig 1 presents a visual depiction of the key processes in Bayesian optimization. The technique adaptively
queries the function at only a few locations to quickly approximate the solution to the optimization problem.
The algorithm uses the current observations and Gaussian process regression [Rasmussen and Williams,
2006] to obtain a mean estimate fˆ(x) (dashed line in Fig 1) of the true function f (x) (bold line in Fig 1) as
well as an estimate σ(x) of the uncertainty in that estimate (the blue shaded region depicts fˆ(x) ± σ(x) in
Fig 1). Notice that uncertainty drops around observation points since (a good estimate of) the true function
value is known there.
Using these, an acquisition function is created. Fig 1(a) uses the simple LCB (lower confidence bound)
acquisition function defined as a(x) = fˆ(x) − σ(x). Other possibilities include EI (expected improvement)
and KG (knowledge gradient). The (estimated) function value at the point x̂query := arg min a(x) is now
queried. Using f (x̂query ), the mean and uncertainty estimates fˆ, σ are updated as shown in Fig 1(b) and the
process is repeated. At the end, the query point with the lowest function value is returned as the estimated
minimum. Note that ESOP can only query VIPER but does not have access to its internal attribute values.
Lack of space does not permit a detailed overview and we refer the reader to [Frazier, 2018] for an
excellent review. ESOP also employs multi-scale search and caching techniques to accelerate computations.
Bayesian optimization routines often enjoy provable convergence bounds which we briefly discuss in Sec 4.3.

Experimental Case Studies

We present case studies with VIPER simulating an in-silico population of 20000 individuals (ESOP scales to
larger populations too). The default attributes settings in VIPER are given in Tab 1. Any modifications to
these are mentioned below.

4.1

Choice of fepi and feco

A lock-down is represented as a 3-D vector x = (i, p, l) of its initiation point (i), period (p) and level (l). Our
N
objective is to minimize fepi + feco where fepi (x) is the peak of the E+I curve. We use feco (x) = 5l · p · 1000
l
to estimate job losses due to the lock-down assuming that a level-l lock-down forces an 50 percent of the
population of N = 20000 into unemployment each day for p days. Note that most natural definitions of
fepi and feco would conflict with each other since fepi would promote aggressive and sustained lock-downs
whereas feco would oppose them.
The notion of feco (·) used above is merely demonstrative and ESOP can instead use a more realistic
definition of feco that might be a non-linear function of x, by asking an economic simulator, just as it asks
values of fepi from an epidemiological simulator such as VIPER. Also, defining the objective as an additive
sum fepi + feco of the two functions is not necessary essential for ESOP to function and users may instead
β
α
prefer other formulations e.g. feco
· fepi
for some α, β > 0, etc.
All that ESOP requires is black-box access to values of the objective function, however it may be defined.
As Fig 3 indicates, ESOP is capable of optimizing highly non-linear functions as well. However, the algorithm
would naturally require more iterations if the objective becomes highly convoluted and sensitive to changes
in the input (see Sec 5 for a brief discussion).

4.2

Using ESOP to Find the Optimal Initiation Point of a Lock-down

Fig 2 considers a simple case where we have decided to impose a 30 time step lock down at level 5 but are
unsure when to initiate the lock down for optimal effect. The objective here is to minimize fepi alone and
feco is not considered since we have already decided the duration and intensity of the lock-down in this case
and hence resigned to a predictable economic outcome. For any initiation point i ∈ N, let fepi (i) be the
largest number of individuals in E and I states at any given point of time (the so called peak of the curve)
if a level 5 lock-down is initiated at t = i.
Fig 2(a) shows the daily count of individuals in various categories if no suppression is used. Note the
large number of non-quarantined yet infectious individuals (I-Q) who are responsible for disease spread. The
number of infected (E+I) individuals peaks at around 15500 at t = 58. For Fig 2(b), ESOP was asked to
suggest when to start a 30 day lock-down at level 5. It suggested starting at t = 33 which brings the peak
down to 8200 cases, a reduction of 47%. Figs 2(c), (d) show similar results but for a viral strain that has an
incubation of 10 days instead of 3 days.
The results show that the optimal initiation point depends significantly on disease characteristics, e.g.,
incubation period of the virus. Nevertheless, ESOP discovers a near-optimal solution, offering far superior
health outcomes compared to a no-lock-down scenario. Note that the number of non-quarantined infectious
individuals continues to rise (see Fig 2(b), (d) insets) even after imposition of lock-down due to the incubation
period of the disease.

4.3

Convergence Rate of ESOP

The topic of how fast do Bayesian optimization routines converge to the optimal solution is a subject of
intense study but one beyond the scope of this paper. Under appropriate assumptions, Bayesian optimization
routines, within T queries to the underlying function (e.g., as ESOP queries fepi via VIPER), are able to offer
a solution that is only T worse than the optimal solution. The sub-optimality T goes down with the number
of queries T at a rate T1α where α > 0 is a constant that depends on the problem setting and the kernel

Figure 4: Optimizing (multi-phase) lock-downs under constraints. See Sec 4.4 for details. ESOP
is able to shift from a containment strategy (e.g. in Fig 4(a)) to a mitigation strategy (e.g. in Fig 4(b))
depending on the constraints. When multiple spikes are inevitable due to constraints on the lock-down (e.g.
upper limits on the duration of the lock-downs), ESOP balances the heights of the spikes to ensure that
infections are evenly distributed among them.
used by the Bayesian optimization procedure (all experiments with ESOP use the Matern kernel). We refer
the reader to [Srinivas et al., 2010] for technical details of these convergence results.
Figs 3(a), (b) show that ESOP achieved the globally optimal initiation point for the two cases considered
in Fig 2 within just 12 and 4 calls to VIPER (see inset figures). To plot the orange curves in Fig 3, VIPER
was queried with all i ∈ [0, 100] to explicitly reveal the globally optimum. This was done so that we could
verify that ESOP does indeed reach the global optimum. However, ESOP itself requires far fewer, e.g. 12 or
4 calls to VIPER to reach the global minimum.

4.4

Using ESOP to Optimize (Multi-phase) Lock-downs under Constraints

Administrative and logistical considerations put constraints on lock-downs, e.g., on when a lock-down can
be initiated or, on how long it can last. Another constraint might be taking into account previously applied
lock-downs. We demonstrate how ESOP can be used to design lock-down schedules that are optimal among
those that satisfy a given set of constraints. Fig 4 considers finding the optimal initiation, period and level
of a lock-down, subject to constraints.
Single-phase Lock-downs under Constraints. For Fig 4(a), ESOP was asked to suggest a lock-down
(no constraints on duration etc). It suggested one at level 3.5 starting t = 3, lasting 69 steps, resulting in a
peak of 303 infections (much smaller than the peaks in Fig 2) and 1092 predicted cases of unemployment. We
note that feco prevents the lock-down from going on indefinitely. The suggested lock-down seems to adopt a
containment strategy, initiating a moderate-level suppression very early on to deplete the pool of infectious
individuals. Note that the pool of non-quarantined infectious individuals is indeed exhausted by the time
the suggested lock-down is over, preventing a second wave of infections. For Fig 4(b), ESOP was forced to

8

suggest a lock-down starting no earlier than t = 12 and lasting no longer than 40 days. Since infections are
already rampant by t = 12, ESOP instead adopts a mitigation strategy of starting a lock-down at t = 30
for 40 steps at level 3.5, causing a peak of 7353 infections and 560 cases of unemployment. Notice that the
lock-down is strategically delayed so that the second wave does not have a higher peak, thus balancing the
two peaks indeed as dictated by fepi .
Multi-phase Lock-downs. For Fig 4(c), ESOP was given a situation where an earlier lock-down (green
shading) had already taken place but was ineffective and left alone, would have caused a massive second
wave with a peak of 14384 (dotted orange curve). ESOP was asked to suggest a new lock-down that starts no
earlier than 10 days after the previous lock-down ended and lasting no longer than 40 days. ESOP suggested
a second lock-down starting at t = 56 lasting 35 steps at level 4 which brings the peak down to 8447 (a
reduction of 40%) and causing 560 additional cases of unemployment. Fig 4(d) considers a scenario where
the policy makes are still dissatisfied with the outcomes, and request a third lock-down starting no earlier
than 10 days after the second lock-down ended and lasting no longer than 40 days. ESOP suggests a third
milder lock-down at level 3.5 starting at t = 114 and lasting 25 days. This brings the peak to a much lower
number (6052 i.e. a further 28% reduction) and 350 additional cases of unemployment.

4.5

Can aggressive quarantining permit ESOP to offer less severe lock-downs?

Intuitively, if aggressive quarantining is applied, then it should be possible to avert an epidemic with milder
lock-downs. Fig 5 verifies this claim by considering at the situation in Fig 4(b) (i.e. starting a lock-down no
earlier than t = 12 days and lasting no longer than 40 days), but with varying quarantine aggressiveness. As
Tab 1 and Sec 2 explain, individuals with viral loads over a threshold QTH get quarantined with a certain
probability profile. Using greater screening and public awareness, this profile can be altered.
Fig 5(a) considers sluggish quarantining with QTH = 0.9 and BQP = 0.0 (the quarantining probability
profile is shown in Fig 5(a) as an inset). Almost no individuals get quarantined and despite its best efforts,
ESOP is only able to offer 11338 peak infections and 800 unemployment cases using a lock-down starting at
t = 32 (level 5, 40 steps). With stronger quarantining at QTH = 0.4 and BQP = 0.3, the situation improves
in Fig 5(b) where ESOP offers fewer infections (7930) and job losses (560) using a lock-down at a reduced
level of 3.5 (starting t = 30, 40 steps). With still stronger quarantining (QTH = 0.0, BQP = 0.0) in Fig 5(c),
ESOP offers a peak of 871 and 378 job losses using a lock-down lasting fewer (27) steps (starting t = 15, level
3.5). Fig 5(c) reports the outcomes with even stronger quarantining at QTH = 0.2 and BQP = 0.5 where
ESOP offers a peak of just 706 and 192 job losses using a lock-down lasting just 16 steps(level 3 starting
t = 12).

4.6

Variations in Demographics and Geographical Distribution of Population

We also consider location (X, Y), susceptibility (SUS) and resistance (RST) values (see Tab 1) which are
not set uniformly but fitted to statistical data for India.
Population Clusters. Instead of distributing individuals uniformly in the box [0, 1]2 , as we did earlier,
we now distribute 34% of the population into 4 Gaussian clusters with standard deviation 0.1 (to simulate
crowded urban areas). India does have a similar proportion of urban population [Bank, 2018]. We distribute
the rest 66% of the population uniformly (to simulate scattered non-urban population).
Fitted Demographic Data. Instead of distributing SUS and RST values uniformly in [0, 1] as we did
earlier, we now distribute these according to age and co-morbidity statistics for India. [Joshi, 2020, Table
1] reports that the four factors with highest risk score for CoViD-19 patients are age above 55 years, male
gender, hypertension, and diabetes. We collected age-stratified statistics for all these factors from respectively
[Home Affairs India, 2016, Detailed Tables], [Ramakrishnan et al., 2019, Table 1] and [Group, 2003, Table
2]. After assigning age, gender, and co-morbidity values to alll individuals so as to fit the Indian statistics,
individuals were assigned a point each for being male, over 55, and suffering from each of the two comorbidities. Thus, an individual could clock up a maximum of 4 points. An individual’s SUS value was then

decided as 0.1 + 0.2 × #points . Their RST value was set to RST = 1 − SUS. Fig 6(b) shows the resulting
distributions.
4.6.1

Results with Fitted Demographic Data and Population Clusters

Fig 7(a) is identical to Fig 4(b) (where ESOP was asked for a lock-down lasting no longer than 40 days
and starting no earlier than t = 12) except that Fig 7(a) also shows (using a dotted orange line) what the
infection curve would have been, had no lock-down been applied at all. Recall that with the lock-down
suggested by ESOP, we had a peak of 7353 infections and 560 cases of unemployment. Fig 7(b) presents
the situation where we use population clusters as well as fitted demographic data. The improvement with
ESOP’s new suggestion is extremely significant with a peak of just 1653 infections (more than 4× reduction)
and 480 cases of unemployment, that too, using a milder lock-down at level 3.0.
To ascertain whether this improvement was due to the demographic change or the population clusters,
Figs 7(c),(d) present ablation studies. In Fig 7(c), only the demographic distributions of RST and SUS are
fitted to Indian data but locations are kept uniformly distributed over the 2-D box [0, 1]2 as we were doing
earlier. In Fig 7(d), RST and SUS values are uniformly distributed over [0, 1] as we were doing earlier, but
34% of the population is clustered into “cities”.
It is clear that changing the location distribution of the individuals alone worsens the outcome (Fig 7(d)
reports a peak of 7657 that is higher than Fig 7(a)). This is to be expected since people are now crowded
into cities . However, changing the demographics of the population to match that of India greatly improves
the outcome (Fig 7(c) reports a peak of just 2083 and just 240 cases of unemployment). This is also to be
expected since India has an extremely favorable age structure. Since applying both changes together, as in
Fig 7(b), also presents a significant improvement over Fig 7(a), this seems to suggest that the demographic
advantages more than overcome the disadvantage due to crowding in cities.

Concluding Remarks

Incorporating age stratification and climate into VIPER and augmenting ESOP to suggest “personalized” ageand climate-specific policies would be interesting. It would also be interesting to develop epidemiological
models that simultaneously track multiple diseases with similar or confounding symptoms, such as CoViD-19
and ILI (Influenza-like illnesses) as it would allow policy models e.g. testing and quarantining models to
be checked for false positive and missed detection rates. Lastly, non-linear systems with negative feedback
loops such as epidemiological models, are known to exhibit chaotic behavior [Bolker, 1993, Eilersen et al.,
2020]. It is interesting how techniques like ESOP can be adapted to handle such systems.

5.1

Relevance to CoViD-19 and Future Prospects

Given the evolving nature of the current CoViD-19 pandemic, a technique like ESOP helps in optimally
designing multi-phase lock-downs, thus avoiding speculation and human error. As shown in Sec 4, whenever
multiple waves of infection are unavoidable due to constraints on lock-downs, ESOP offers lock-down schedules
that balance the peaks of these multiple outbreaks, ensuring no peak is too high. To maximize the impact of
methods such as ESOP, close interaction and collaboration is needed with experts in the epidemiological and
social sciences to better align ESOP with professional epidemiological forecasting and economic forecasting
models. ESOP’s interaction with these models is of a black-box nature which makes integration smoother
and simpler.
