The world evolution of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2
or simply COVID-19) led the World Health Organization to declare it a pandemic. The
disease appeared in China in December 2019, and it has spread fast around the world,
specially in european countries like Italy and Spain. The first reported case in Brazil
was recorded in February 26, and after that the number of cases growed fast. In order to
slow down the initial growth of the disease through the country, confirmed positive cases
were isolated to not transmit the disease. To better understand the early evolution of
COVID-19 in Brazil, we apply a Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR)
model to the analysis of data from the Brazilian Department of Health, obtained from
February 26, 2020 through March 25, 2020. Based on analyical and numerical results, as
well on the data, the basic reproduction number is estimated to R0 = 5.25. In addition,
we estimate that the ratio unidentified infectious individuals and confirmed cases at
the beginning of the epidemic is about 10, in agreement with previous studies. We also
estimated the epidemic doubling time to be 2.72 days.

1. Introduction
The evolution of epidemics is one of the most dangerous problems for a society.
The humanity faced severe pandemics during its evolution, like the Spanish flu in
1917, the Honk Kong flu (H3N2) of 1968 and the swine flu (H1N1) in 2009. Several
efforts were done since 70’s in order to understand the mathematical evolution and
spreading of diseases 1,2 .
Recently, in December, 2019, Wuhan city, the capital of Hubei province in China,
became the centre of an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause. By January
7, 2020, Chinese scientists had isolated a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), from these patients with virus-infected
pneumonia 3,4 , which was later designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
in February, 2020, by World Health Organization.

In order to better understand such new disease, a lot of papers and preprints were
published in the last months 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24 ,
analyzing various properties of the COVID-19, as well as modeling its evolution
in many countries. Our target in this work is to performe a data analysis of the evolution of COVID-19 in Brazil. We collected data from the Brazilian Department of
Health, and apply a Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) model
to analyze the COVID-19 dynamics.
This work is organized as follows. In Section II we present the SIQR model,
and define its parameters. In Section 3 we perform the data analysis and present
analytical and numerical results based on the SIQR model. Finally, we present a
discussion in Section IV. Some numerical details are presented in an Appendix.
2. Model
The model considered in this work is a variant of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered
(SIR) model 1,2 . In addition to the usual compartments Susceptible (S), Infected (I)
and Recovered (R), an extra compartment is considered, namely Quarantined (Q)
25,8,7 . N is the total number of individuals in the population, assumed constant
since we are studying the early phase of the epidemic. In this case, we have the
normalization condition at each time step, i.e., N (t) = S(t) + I(t) + Q(t) + R(t).
Notice that both I and Q individuals are infected, but as discussed in 7 this
separation is convenient because it models the fact that many governments (including the Brazilian one) are forcing individuals tested positive (confirmed cases) to
self-isolate from the community, and also because it distinguishes between the infectious people who do self-isolate, and/or those who do not (mostly likely because
they have not developed the symptoms of the disease and are not aware of actually
being infectious). Thus, the SIQR model may be described by the following rate
equations:
dS
dt
dI
dt
dQ
dt
dR
dt

= −β S I/N

(1)

= β S I/N − (α + η) I

(2)

= ηI −γQ

(3)

= γ Q + αI

(4)

In the above equations, β denotes the infection rate, α is a rate that quantifies
the recovering of asymptomatic individuals and η is the rate of detection of new
cases a . Finally, γ stands for the recovering of quarantined individuals.
a In

this case, an infected individual is positive tested and becomes a confirmed case. This individual
is isolated (quarantined).

Modeling the early evolution of the COVID-19 in Brazil: results from a Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) model

3. Results
Looking at the data 26 , the first case in Brazil was reported in February 26. Thus,
at the present moment a relatively small fraction of the Brazilian population has
been found positive for COVID-19, which means we are still in the early phase of
the epidemic where we have S/N ≈ 1. In this case Eq. (2) can be approximated to
dI
= [β − (α + η)] I ,
dt
that can be directed integrated to obtain
I(t) = I0 e[β−(α+η)] t ,

(5)

(6)

where I0 is the number of infectious individuals at the beginning of the outbreak.
Eq. (6) can be rewriten as I(t) = I0 e(α+η)(R0 −1) t , and one can obtain the expression
for the basic reproduction number R0 ,
R0 =

β
.
α+η

(7)

As it is well known, the basic reproduction number R0 is an indicator of the occurrence of an outbreak (if R0 > 1). We will see in the following that one can estimate
its value from the data.
As discussed in 8 , the number of individuals that have been confirmed positive
for COVID-19 and put in isolation does not correspond to I but to Q + R. One can
found a relevant analytical expression summing Eqs. (3) and (4),
d [Q + R](t)
= (α + η) I(t) .
dt
Substituting the result (6) in Eq. (8) and integrating over t, one obtains
α+η
I0 (e[β−(α+η)] t − 1) .
[Q + R](t) =
β − (α + η)

(8)

(9)

We fitted Eq. (9) to the the Brazilian COVID-19 data 26 from February 26,
2020 through March 25, 2020. The estimated values were (α + η) I0 = 0.482 and
β − (α + η) = 0.255 (see details in the Appendix). Based on data, we take I0 = 8
(see Appendix), which gives us α + η = 0.06 and β = 0.315. Considering those
estimates, we plot in Fig. 1 the temporal evolution of the number of cases together
with Eq. (9).
Based on the above-mentioned fitted values, one can estimate from Eq. (7)
R0 = 5.25, which is in line with previous estimates of R0 falling between 1.4 and
6.5 5,8,11,16,18 . In addition, one can estimate the epidemic doubling time, that
characterize the sequence of intervals at which the cumulative incidence doubles.
From the above result I(t) = I0 e(α+η)(R0 −1) t one can obtain the doubling time
as τ = ln 2/[(α + η) (R0 − 1)]. Based on the above estimated parameters, we have
τ = 2.72 days, which falls in the range 1.4 < τ < 3.0 estimated in China 19 .
As discussed in the Appendix, we estimate η = 0.03, α = 0.03 and γ = 0.04.
Considering those values, as well as the previous estimated values of β and I0 , we

plot in Fig. 2 the time evolution of the number of Infected (I), Quarantined (Q) and
total confirmed cases (Q+R), obtained by the numerical integration of the Eqs. (1)
to (4). For these curves, we considered N as the total brazilian population, N = 2.17
x 108 . One can see that the number of infected and nonconfirmed cases I grows
faster than the number of confirmed and isolated individuals Q. This unbalance is
observed in all the world, since there is a huge number of undocumented infection
cases for the COVID-19, as discussed in a recent work 5 .
For better quantify the unbalance among unidentified infectious individuals and
confirmed and isolated cases, one can discuss about the ratio I/Q. Taking the ratio
of Eqs. (3) and (2), and considering the approximated result for short times, Eq.
(5), one can obtain

(10)

Based on the estimated values of the parameters, Eq. (10) gives us I/Q ≈ 9.83, i.e.,
for each patient in quarantine approximately ten infectious individuals are present
in the population b . This is in agreement with a recent work that states that 86% of
all infections were undocumented in China 5 . Thus, there are still many unidentified
cases that do not appear in the official statistics.

b This

number of course depends on a precise estimate of the value of γ, but usually the recovered
rates are small, in the range 0.01 < γ < 0.05, which give us 8.83 < (I/Q) < 10.16.

confirmed cases are exhibited as well (squares). The parameters are I0 = 8, β = 0.315, η = α = 0.03
and γ = 0.04.

4. Discussion
The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Brazil is growing exponentially fast.
Based on the data, we considered a Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered
(SIQR) on a fully-connected population. Despite the simplicity of the model, we
can made estimates of the infection rate, the rate which individuals are isolated
from the population and some others, as well as the basic reproduction number and
the doubling time of the epidemics, based on the data available at the site of the
Brazilian Department of Health.
For the considered parameters, we observed that the number of quarantined
individuals grows fast (exponentially), stabilizes and after it decays to zero, as it is
standard in compartmental models. Based on the data, we can see that the number
of such isolated individuals grows until Day 90 from the beginning of the disesase
spreading (February 26, 2020). Thus, the model predicts that the maximum number
of isolated individuals will occur about May 25, 2020. This is in line with a recent
estimate 15 . This peak is associated with the isolation of about 20% of the brazilian
population.
This pessimistic estimate can be modified if the government imposes limitations
for the population, as was done in some countries like Italy, Spain and India. In order
to reduce the growing of the number of cases, social isolation was suggested in some
brazilian states, but it was only a suggestion by the local governments, i.e., there is
no mandatory quarantine. In a recent work 15 , the authors analyzed the potential
role of non-pharmaceutical interventions in UK and USA. They conclude that the
effectiveness of any one intervention in isolations likely to be limited, requiring
multiple interventions to be combined to have a substantial impact on transmission.

Other recent work 12 studied the role of people mobility in the diffusion of the
COVID-19 in China. They show that travel restrictions are useful in the early stage
of an outbreak when it is confined to a certain area that acts as a major source. In
the case of Brazil, the major sources are the cities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro,
and immediate actions of restrictions in mobility need to be adopted to control the
spread of COVID-19 27 .

Appendix A.
In this appendix we discuss about the estimates of the model’s parameters. Considering Eq. (9), we did a least squares fitting of the data considering a function
f (t) = (a/b) (eb t − 1). In comparison with Eq. (9), we have the identification
a = (α + η) I0 and b = β − (α + η). The fitting procedure gives us a = 0.482 ± 0.125
and b = 0.255 ± 0.012. Thus, we have (α + η) I0 = 0.482 and β − (α + η) = 0.255.
The time in our graphics were counted after the first confirmed case in Brazil, i.e.,
Day 1 was February 26, 2020. The number of confirmed cases kept almost constant
for some days, and start to grow faster since day 9 (March 5, 2020), where 8 cases
were confirmed. In this case, we take the number of initial cases as I0 = 8 for the
model’s purposes. Thus, from (α+η) I0 = 0.482 we obtained (α+η) = 0.060±0.002.
Considering this result, from β − (α + η) = 0.255 we obtained β = 0.315 ± 0.010.
As discussed in 8 , the parameter η is related to the time until patients are
tested positive and isolated, but also to the fraction of all infectious individuals
that are tested positive. These are mostly symptomatic patients, which we assume
are isolated soon after the incubation time is over and first symptoms appear. The
incubation time means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have
symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19
range from 1-14 days, most commonly around ≈ 5 days 28 . Letting δ denote the
fraction of infectious individuals entering Q, we obtain η = δ x 0.2.
It was reported that ≈ 50% of the population is asymptomatic 29 , but some
milder cases may also go unnoticed and not end in isolation. Considering the very
small quantity of tests made in brazilians, we assume that δ = 15% of infectious
individuals are tested after an average of 5 days. We thus set η = 0.15 x 0.2 = 0.03.
From the above obtained relation, (α + η) = 0.06, we have α = 0.03 (±0.003).
Finally, until March 25, 2020, the number of recovered individuals in Brazil is
very small, and it is hard to obtain an estimate of γ. In this case, for most results we
considered γ = 0.04, in line with Ref. 8 . Notice that the main result of the model,
the total number of confirmed cases Q + R, do not depend on γ, as we can see in
Eq. (9).
