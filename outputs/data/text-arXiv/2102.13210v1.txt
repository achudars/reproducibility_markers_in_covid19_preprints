Covid-19 is particularly mild with children, and its severity escalates with age. Several
theories have been proposed to explain these facts. In particular, it was proposed that
the lower expression of the viral receptor ACE2 in children protects them from severe
Covid. However, other works suggested an inverse relationship between ACE2
expression and disease severity. Here we try to reconcile seemingly contradicting
observations noting that ACE2 is not monotonically related with age but it reaches a
maximum at a young age that depends on the cell type and then decreases. This
pattern is consistent with most existing data from humans and rodents and it is
expected to be more marked for ACE2 cell protein than for mRNA because of the
increase with age of the protease TACE/ADAM17 that sheds ACE2 from the cell
membrane to the serum.
The negative relation between ACE2 level and Covid-19 severity at old age is not
paradoxical but it is consistent with a mathematical model of virus propagation that
predicts that higher viral receptor does not necessarily favour virus propagation and it
can even slow it down. More importantly, ACE2 is known to protect organs from
chronic and acute inflammation, which are worsened by low ACE2 levels. Here we
propose that ACE2 contributes essentially to reverse the inflammatory process by
downregulating the pro-inflammatory peptides of the angiotensin and bradykinin
system, and that failure to revert the inflammation triggered by SARS-COV-2 may
underlie both severe CoViD-19 infection and its many post-infection manifestations,
including the multi-inflammatory syndrome of children (MIS-C). Within this view, lower
severity in children despite lower ACE2 expression may be consistent with their higher
expression of the alternative angiotensin II receptor ATR2 and in general of the antiinflammatory arm of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) at young age.
Introduction
The Covid-19 pandemics (Zhou et al. 2020) has overcome the startling figure of two
million confirmed deaths (Dong et al. 2020), and excess death indicates that the real
number is substantially higher (Vestergaard et al. 2020; Weinberger et al. 2020).
However, in contrast with the high mortality of the elderlies, children predominantly
develop a mild form of Covid-19 and their mortality is very low, as part of a general
trend of increasing Covid-19 severity with age. Age-stratified mortality rates with
respect to detected cases increase very steeply with age, and even more steeply if we

consider that most infections are asymptomatic at young age and they tend to go
undetected. Fig.1 shows the approximately exponential increase with age of detected
cases, hospitalizations, ICU and deaths with respect to the number of seropositives
detected in population-wide antibody surveys in Spain at 10 of May 2020. One can see
that the increase with age is apparent at all levels of severity, except for a drop of ICU
at high age that unfortunately is probably explained by the saturation of the health
system during the first pandemic wave.

Fig.1 Covid-19 severity increases exponentially with age. Black: Cases detected through
positive PCR. Red: PCR-positive patients that required hospitalization. Green: PCRpositive patients in ICU. The drop at high age probably reflects the saturation of the
health system during the first wave of the pandemics. Black: Deceased patients with
positive PCR (the real toll estimated with excess deaths is unfortunately much higher).
Several theories have been proposed to explain why Covid-19 is so mild with children,
recently reviewed by Zimmerman and Curtis (2020). One group of theories postulates
different immune response in children. Cristiani et al. (2020) invoke the strength of the
innate immunity of children, which is further reinforced by the frequent infections and
the vaccines that they are exposed to, which enhance their trained immunity. Carsetti
et al. (2020) propose that the immune system of children responds better to new
pathogens. Also at the level of the adaptive immunity children might have an
advantage, since they present more often antibodies against common human
coronaviruses that can cross-react with SARS-COV-2 (Ng et al. 2020). However, despite
the immune response of children and adults to SARS-CoV-2 are markedly different,
with children expressing a different spectrum of immune molecules, Pierce et al.

(2020) argued that the greater severity of hospitalized adults compared to children
could not be attributed to their less efficient immune responses.
A second group of theories is based on factors that put aged adults at increased risk,
including co-morbidities and, above all, differences in the endothelial system, as
reported in a Nature news article (Cyranoski 2020). The uncompromised state of the
endothelial system of children may protect them from the most severe complications
of Covid-19 that originate from endothelial inflammation and dysfunction, as proposed
by Monagle group at Melbourne hospital and by other groups (Nature News 2020).
However, the theory that captured most attention is probably the one based on the
variation of the viral receptor ACE2 with age. It was recently observed that ACE2 mRNA
and serum protein is lower in children than in adults (Bunyavanich, Do and Vicencio
2020; Muus et al. 2020; Sharif-Askari et al. 2020, Pavel et al. 2020), and it was
proposed that lower receptor levels protect children from severe SARS-CoV-2
infection. Nevertheless, data on ACE2 expression across age are contradictory. Some
works found that ACE2 protein in cells is lower in children than in adults (Inde et al.
2020) and others reached the opposite conclusion (Zhang, Guo et al. 2020; OrtizBezara et al. 2020).
Here we go beyond the dichotomy between children and adults and propose an
alternative interpretation of the data, supported by observations that indicate that
ACE2 mRNA and protein expression start from zero during foetal life and reach a
maximum at young age (Muus et al. 2020; Inde et al. 2020), after which they decay
with age in adult rats and mice (Xie et al. 2006; Schouten et al. 2016; Yoon et al. 2016;
Booeshaghi and Pachter 2020) and in humans (Chen et al. 2020; Zhang, Guo et al.
2020), with strong inter-individual variation and cell-type dependent maximum age
(Ortiz-Bezara et al. 2020; Inde et al. 2020). ACE2 cell protein level behaves differently
from ACE2 mRNA, due to the shedding of ACE2 from the cell membrane to the serum
produced by the metalloprotease TACE/ADAM17 (Lambert et al. 2005). The increased
expression of ADAM17 through age (Dou et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2019) predicts
increasing ACE2 shedding and implies that the maximum expression is achieved at
earlier age for ACE2 protein than for ACE2 mRNA.
Whereas the comparison between children and adults supports a positive correlation
between ACE2 level and disease severity, the comparison between young and old
adults supports their negative correlation. That lower receptor level is not necessarily a
protective factor is predicted by a mathematical model according to which, in some
circumstances, viruses propagate in the infected organism more slowly with higher
receptor level (Ortega-Cejas et al. 2004; see Fig.4 for illustration). Most importantly,
low ACE2 levels expose the lungs to acute inflammation (Imai et al. 2005), andACE2 is
low in most common chronic pathologies including hypertension, angiocardiopathy,
type 2 diabetes, chronic renal failure, pulmonary diseases and liver diseases (Li et al.
2020; Pagliaro and Penna 2020). For these reasons, several authors proposed that the
severity of Covid-19 is exacerbated by the degradation of ACE2 by the virus (Sun et al.
2020; Gurwitz 2020; Verdecchia et al. 2020; Ciaglia et al. 2020; Offringa et al. 2020;

Annweiler et al. 2020 among others). In this paper, we propose that one of the main
functions of ACE2 consists in contributing to reverse the inflammatory state, and that
the degradation of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 is one of the main triggers of the acute
inflammation observed in severe Covid-19.
ACE2 in the context of the angiotensin and bradykinin systems
The Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor of SARS, SARS-CoV-2 and
other coronaviruses, plays a regulatory role in the RAS and in the Kallikrenin-kinin
system (KKS). These two systems are strongly coupled, since they share some of their
main functions (control of blood pressure, blood coagulation, control of inflammatory
processes, regulation of the immune system response after infection or traumatic
events) and two key enzymes, the carboxy-peptidases ACE and ACE2 that regulate the
signal peptides of both systems, the family of angiotensin for the RAS and bradykinin
for the KKS. Their receptors, which belong to the big family of G-protein coupled
receptors (GPCR), may act in a synergistic manner, forming complexes that mutually
enhance each other signalling through allosteric interactions (Quitterer and AbdAlla
2014). Thus, it can be considered that RAS and KKS form an integrated system.
In the RAS, ACE2 downregulates the pro-inflammatory and vasoconstrictor peptide
Angiotensin II (Ang-II, which we denote here as Ang1-8 to make more explicit that it
consists of the first 8 amino acids of the peptide Angiotensin I or Ang1-10) that
increases blood pressure, transforming it into the form Ang1-7 that mediates
vasodilator and anti-inflammatory effects through the Mas receptor. Moreover, ACE2
transforms Ang1-10, the precursor of Ang1-8, into the form Ang1-9 that is later
transformed into Ang1-7 by ACE. In the KKS, ACE2 degrades Des-Arg-Bradykinin and
Lys-Des-Arg-Bradykinin (BK1-8 and LysBK0-8), two peptides that signal through the
receptor BKR1 that is expressed upon inflammation. Bradykinin signalling produces
vasodilation, decreases blood pressure, increases vascular permeability and induces
capillary leakage. These actions can produce the edemas suffered by severe Covid-19
patients. Moreover, bradykinin enhances the inflammation by recruiting neutrophils
and leukocytes and by upregulating the protease TACE/ADAM17 that activates the
tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-) and removes ACE2 from the cell membrane. The
involvement of the KKS in Covid-19 cases has been discussed in recent publications
(Nicolau, Magalhães and Vale 2020; van de Veerdonk et al. 2020; Garvin et al. 2020;
Zwaveling et al. 2020). It is consistent with the observation that a fraction of Covid-19
patients present hypotension (66% of critical patients, Michard and Vieillard‑Baron
2020, and 8% of hospitalized patients compared with 39% with hypertension, Table 2
of Lala et al. 2020).
We represent in Fig.2 the reduced molecular network of the RAS and KKS.

Fig.2 Simplified representation of the Renin-Angiotensin system and the KallikreinBradykinin system, coupled through the peptidases ACE and ACE2 that act on both
families of peptides and through the allosteric interactions between the G-protein
coupled receptors of both families. Peptides of the angiotensin (Ang) and bradykinin
(BK) family are represented as rectangles, coloured arrows indicate their
transformations and circles indicate the peptidases that catalyse them (black arrows).
Membrane receptors are indicated as triangles and the boxes indicate the main effects
of their signalling. The colour code represents inflammatory effects (orange: proinflammatory; green: anti-inflammatory, blue: Neutral or not clear at present). Also
represented as ellipses are Vitamin D, which downregulates Renin and the downstream effectors NFkB and NOX, and Interferons and , both of which upregulate
ACE2 with anti-inflammatory effects, and , which downregulates ACE2.
The main functional role of ACE2 may consist in reversing the inflammation process
ACE2 counteracts high blood pressure in the RAS and low blood pressure in the KKS,
but it has anti-inflammatory effects in both systems. Interestingly, several studies have
shown that ACE2 knockout mice do not present significant hypertension or cardiac
anomalies (Crackower et al. 2002; Gurley et al. 2006; Alghamri et al. 2013), but they
show enhanced response to Ang1-8 stimulation (Alghamri et al. 2013) and they
develop lung edema after acute-inflammation (Imai et al. 2005). Edema is not the
mechanical consequence of increased blood pressure, which does not happen in ACE2
KO mice, but it may derive from increased vascular permeability due to high bradykinin
levels (van de Veerdonk et al. 2020). This is supported by the observation that
attenuation of pulmonary ACE2 activity impairs inactivation of the DABK/BK1R axis and
facilitates neutrophil infiltration (Sodhi et al. 2017). These observations connect ACE2
with the termination of the inflammatory process, as further discussed below.
A crucial link between ACE2 and the inflammatory process goes through the Tumor
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) converting enzyme (TACE), also known as ADAM17. This

metallo-protease sheds ACE2 from the cellular membrane to the serum (Lambert et al.
2005), from which it is rapidly eliminated through urine, and at the same time it
activates the cytokine TNF-, initiating a cascade process that, through the
transcription factor nuclear factor  B (NF-promotes the activation of the
inflammatory response. Importantly, ADAM17 is upregulated by the Ang1-8 receptor
ATR1 (Deshotels et al. 2014; Xu et al. 2017) and the bradykinin receptor BKR1 (Parekh
et al. 2020), both of which are downregulated by ACE2, which establishes two
dangerous positive loops that can enhance ACE2 degradation.
Here we summarize the main steps with which the RAS and the KKS participate in the
inflammation process
1) The infection activates the RAS, enhancing Ang1-8 production
2) High Ang1-8/ATR1 generates a positive feedback by upregulating ACE,
downregulating ACE2 (Koka et al. 2008), and upregulating AT1R/ADAM17 (Deshotels et
al. 2014), which sheds ACE2 from the cell membrane to the serum (Lambert et al.
2005) and activates the cytokine TNF-. This positive feedback loop leads to even
greater local Ang1-8 production.
3) At the same time, Ang1-8/ATR1 enhances the inflammation:
3a) Ang1-8/ATR1 activates the KKS, with different effects on the two receptors BKR1
and BKR2. Through IL1 and TNF-, ATR1 upregulates the BKR1 receptor of DABK,
whose level may increase through the decrease of ACE2, activating the DABK/BKR1
axis. Both ATR1 and BKR1 (Parekh et al. 2020) upregulate ADAM17-TACE, producing
another positive feedback loop. At the same time, the other bradykinin receptor BKR2
is sensitized by ATR1, with which it forms a dimer (Quitterer and AbdAlla 2014).
However, increased ACE downregulates the ligand BKR2, so the effect on BKR2
signalling is unclear. The net effect of the activation of the KKS is vasodilation,
increased capillary leakage and recruitment of neutrophils.
3b) Ang1-8/ATR1 upregulates the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) through
TGF-beta and Angiopoietin-2, thus amplifying capillary leakage. At the same time,
VEGF may be also activated by BKR2.
3c) Ang1-8/ATR1 and DABK/BKR1 recruit macrophages and neutrophils to the
infection.
4) At some point, ACE2 is upregulated and it contributes to reversing the inflammation
in multiple ways: ACE2 degrades Ang1-8 and Ang1-10, downregulating the Ang18/ATR1 axis, produces Ang1-7, upregulating the anti-inflammatory Ang1-7/Mas, and
degrades DABK, diminishing vascular leakage. Downregulation of ATR1 reduces the
VEGF, de-sensitives the BKR2 receptor, reduces the BKR1 receptors, reduces ADAM17TACE and, through it, reduces TNF-.
Consistent with this view, ACE2 is upregulated during inflammation (Hanafy et al.
2011), in part through interferon I stimulation (Ziegler et al. 2020). ACE2 upregulation

is also observed in a recent analysis of mRNA expression of bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid cells (Garvin et al. 2020) and lung cells (Wu et al. 2020) of Covid-19 patients.
However, the ACE2/ACE ratio is decreased in most chronic inflammatory diseases, and
it may contribute to these pathologies (Li et al. 2020; Pagliaro and Penna 2020). As
discussed below, we hypothesize that epigenetic mechanisms have a role in the
discrepancy between short term activation and chronic reduction of ACE2.
Severe Covid-19 as a failure of ACE2 to revert inflammation
As discussed above, ACE2 plays a key role in reverting the inflammatory process in the
context of the RAS and the KKS, and its downregulation favour endothelial damage,
capillary leakage and angioedema, as shown by Imai et al. (2005) and Kuba et al. (2005)
among others.
It has been shown that SARS-CoV (Haga et al. 2008) and SARS-CoV-2 degrade ACE2. We
hypothesize that the degradation of ACE2, especially in presence of low initial levels, or
the failure to upregulate ACE2 possibly due to low levels of Interferon (Bastard et al.
2020) may prevent the termination of the inflammatory process and perpetuate the
propagation of inflammation through the affected organs, leading to organ damage
and severe manifestations that can be life threatening.
In a transcriptomic study of lung tissue obtained from patients who died of Covid-19 in
China it was found that the viral load was low in all samples. According to the authors,
this “suggests that the patient deaths may be related to the host response rather than
an active fulminant infection.”
A retrospective study of almost 48,000 Covid-19 patients discharged from English
hospitals (and, accordingly, negative to the virus in their large majority) found rates of
hospital readmission and death 3.5 and 7.7 times greater, respectively, than in ageand comorbidities-matched controls, and higher rates of respiratory, diabetes and
cardiovascular events, evidencing elevated rates of multi-organ dysfunction in
individuals discharged from hospital (Ayoubkhani et al. 2021). Relative rates were
higher for persons below 70 years than for older ones, and for ethnic minorities than
for the White population. These observations indicate that many severe consequences
of Covid-19 arise from the immune-inflammatory response rather than being a direct
consequence of SARS-COV-2 infection.
Variation of ACE2 across age
Several studies based on RNA-seq experiments found that the mRNA of ACE2 is absent
in the early foetus and it is lower in children than adults (Bunyavanich, Do and Vicencio
2020; Muus et al. 2020; Sharif-Askari et al. 2020; Inde et al. 2020). A similar
observation applies to the ACE2 protein in serum (Pavel et al. 2020). Therefore, it was
proposed that the low expression of the virus receptor ACE2 hinders the propagation
of SARS-CoV-2 in children organs. However, several studies, including also some of
those cited above, indicate that the expression of ACE2 with age is not monotonic,
since ACE2 expression decreases at advanced age in several organs after reaching a

maximum. At the mRNA level, decrease of ACE2 mRNA at advanced age was observed
in mouse lung samples (Booeshaghi and Pachter 2020) and in an analysis of several
human tissues collected in the GTeX database (Chen et al. 2020). Single cell data of
human respiratory cells reported in Figure 3g of Muus et al. (2020) are also consistent
with decrease or stationarity of ACE2 mRNA after a maximum reached at 10-25 years
in multiciliated cells and 25-40 years in AT2 cells. A recent preprint (Inde et al. 2020)
also found a maximum of ACE2 mRNA in mouse lungs at few days after birth,
evidenced a minimum at approximately 10 days and an increase at least until 9-11
months, which in mice is middle age. For human data, the same preprint found a
maximum of ACE2 mRNA short after birth in the hearth and at about 10 years in the
testis (Fig. 6C and 6D of Inde et al.). Inde et al. also present data of ACE2 mRNA in
human lungs in their Fig. 3G, which does not show the existence of a maximum but
cannot rule it out due to the sparsity of data at advanced age.
Concerning ACE2 protein in cells, which is the relevant molecular species for virus
propagation, western blot analysis of rat lungs (Xie et al. 2006) and mouse aorta (Yoon
et al. 2016) indicate that ACE2 membrane protein levels decrease with age in adult
rodents. These studies did not include juvenile animals and examined three age
classes: 2 (3 for rats), 12 and 24 months, corresponding to young adults, middle age
and old. In mouse thoracic aorta, the whole anti-inflammatory arm of the RAS to which
ACE2 belongs decreases with age, while the pro-inflammatory arm of the RAS increase
with age (Yoon et al. 2016). In humans, a study found that children below 10 years
have on the average higher ACE2 protein in AT2 lung cells than adults, although these
values vary considerably from cell to cell and from individual to individual (Ortiz-Bezara
et al. 2020). However, this comparison depended on the discretization of ACE2
expression with an arbitrary threshold of more than 1% of positive cells, and it
included adults with asthma that downregulates ACE2, whose exclusion would have
raised the p-value. Moreover, other cell types did not confirm the same trend as AT2
lung cells. Zhang, Guo et al. (2020) found that ACE2 positive cells in lung biopsy
samples from 26 children and 24 adults were significantly decreased in patients older
than 50 with respect to children. This reduction was observed in bronchial cells but it
was not significant in pulmonary alveolar cells, and it was also observed at the mRNA
level. The study by Inde et al. (2020) also found extreme intra- and inter-individual
heterogeneity, but it reached the opposite conclusion that ACE2 protein in human lung
epithelial cells increases with age; however, also this conclusion was reached
measuring the percentage of cells that express ACE2 above a threshold. Inde et al. also
plot ACE2 intensities versus the donor age in their figures 1C and 1G, but these figures
do not suggest a clear increase of ACE2 with age. Furthermore, they did not observe
increase of ACE2 with age in AT2 cells, which are the cell type with maximum ACE2
expression in the lungs (Li et al. 2020).
We conclude that most existing data are consistent with a decrease across age of ACE2
mRNA and protein levels in rodents and several human cell types. Accordingly, we plot
in Fig.3A a model in which ACE2 expression starts in the last stage of foetal life,
reaches a maximum at young age and then decreases at old age, with data inspired on

the data of Muus et al. in multiciliated cells. The position of the maximum depends on
the cell type and it is influenced by the strong inter- and intra-individual variability
evidenced by several studies (Ortiz-Bezara et al. 2020; Inde et al. 2020).

Fig.3. A: Proposed behavior of ACE2 with age at the three levels of mRNA, protein in
the cellular membrane and protein in serum. B: The severity of pediatric cases of Covi19 in China decreases with age (Dong et al. 2020); C: The same data, rescaled to take
into account undetected cases, and put in the context of severe Covid-19 cases of
children and adults from Fig.1.
For understanding the relation between ACE2 mRNA and protein expression it is
necessary to consider the expression of the metalloprotease ADAM17/TACE. This
enzyme sheds ACE2 from the cell membrane to the serum (Lambert et al. 2005; Xu et
al. 2017), from which it is rapidly lost through urine. The expression of ADAM17
increases with age (Dou et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2019), consistent with the increase with
age of Ang1-8 and its receptor ATR1 (Yoon et al. 2016) that upregulates ADAM17
(Deshotels et al. 2014) together with the bradykinin receptor BKR1 (Parekh et al.
2020).
As a result of mRNA expression and shedding through ADAM17, the stationary
concentration of ACE2 cell protein is proportional to the ratio ACE2mRNA/ADAM17.
We plot this function in Fig.3A, where we assume that ADAM17 decrease is inversely
proportional to the square root of age. One can see that the maximum of ACE2 cell
protein is reached at earlier age than the maximum of ACE2 mRNA, as the
consequence of the increase of ADAM17 with age. ACE2 cell protein decreases in rats
and mice from 3 to 12 months (Xie et al. 2006; Yoon et al. 2016) while ACE2 mRNA
increases in mice of the same age (Inde et al. 2020). Although this comparison involves
different species (rats versus mice) or different cell types (aorta versus lungs), it is

consistent with the above prediction. ACE2 protein in the serum is proportional to the
product of the cell protein times the shedding rate, i.e. it is proportional to ACE2
mRNA averaged over the different cell types. We depict in Fig.3A the proposed
behaviour of ACE2 versus age at the levels of mRNA, cell protein and serum protein.
Covid-19 severity across age presents a minimum
A paediatric study in China (Dong et al. 2020) observed that the severity of Covid-19 in
children (not including the MIS-C syndrome) decreases with age: the proportion of
severe and critical paediatric cases was 10.6%, 7.3%, 4.2%, 4.1%, and 3.0% for the age
groups <1, 1-5, 6-10, 11-15 and 16-18 years, respectively (Fig.3B). This decrease of
severity from young children to teen agers is consistent with the drop in the
hospitalization rate in Spain from the age class 0-10 to 10-20 that one can see in Fig.1.
Covid-19 severity increase with age in adults (Fig 1), therefore severity versus age has a
minimum (Fig.3C). Suggestively, the shape of this curve appears inversely related to
the ACE2 protein level across age (Fig.3A), although the position of the maximum of
ACE2 depends on the cell type. Another recent paper analysed similar data but
proposed a direct instead of inverse relationship between Covid-19 severity and ACE2
expression (Inde et al. 2020). However, most existing data suggest that ACE2
expression decreases at high age, although this point is still debated, and the increase
of severity with age is a very clear property of Covid-19.
Comorbidities support a negative relation between ACE2 and Covid-19 severity
As discussed in more detail in a preprint (Bastolla 2020), this inverse relationship
between ACE2 levels and Covid-19 severity might rationalize not only the influence of
age and sex but also most of the other known risk factors of Covid-19 examined in the
OpenSAFELY study (Williamson et al. 2020), including diabetes, hypertension, obesity,
vitamin D deficit (that may explain at least part of the risk factors connected with
ethnicity) and perhaps even the curious protecting effect of smoke that increases ACE2
expression (Sharif-Askari et al. 2020).
Besides being low in most chronic inflammatory diseases (Li et a. 2020; Pagliaro and
Penna 2020), the ACE2/ACE cell protein was found to be lower than control in broncho
alveolar lavage (BAL) samples from 14 pediatric patients with acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) (Wösten-van Asperen et al. 2013) and in mice with ARDS, in which
the ACE2/ACE ratio decreased with age (Schouten et al. 2016). The decrease of
ACE2/ACE with age was not observed in human patients with ARDS (Schouten et al.
2019), but this observation was based on only one measure per patient that might
have been obscured by the complex time course of the disease.
Effect of receptor level on viral propagation
The theory according to which lower ACE2 level may protect from severe disease is
based on the premise that lower receptor level hinders the propagation of the virus.
But is this assumption warranted? Mathematical models of virus propagation, tested
with experiments with bacteriophages, suggest that there is an optimal receptor

density at which the virus propagates fastest, with viral velocity declining both for
lower and for higher receptor density (Ortega-Cejas et al. 2004; see Fig. 4); and a
mathematical model of the dependence of Covid-19 mortality on receptor density
fitted to both Covid-19 and SARS 2003 data of lethality across age and sex suggests
that both viruses propagates in a regime in which increasing receptor density slows
down their propagation (Bastolla 2020). Thus, the inverse relation between ACE2
expression and Covid-19 severity is not implausible.

Fig.4 Mathematical model of the velocity of viral propagation in an organ as a function
of the receptor density (adapted from the formulas presented in Ortega-Cejas et al.
2004 tested with experiments on bacteriophage propagation).
The ATR2 receptor
The proposed inverse relationship between ACE2 expression and Covid-19 severity has
an exception in children, who experience mild Covid-19 but express less ACE2 than
adults. However, children express more than adults the Ang1-8 receptor ATR2, which
competes with ATR1 and counteracts its inflammatory effect (Millan et al. 1991; Sechi
et al. 1992; Shanmugam et al. 1996; Kaschina and Unger 2003; Kaschina, Namsolleck
and Unger 2017; Yoon et al. 2006). The decrease of ATR2 with age has been recently
disputed (Gao et al. 2012), but most works support it, and they also concluded that the
receptor binding activity of ATR2, which is most relevant in this context, decreases
with age. Both ATR1 and ATR2 are GPCR, and they can form complexes between
themselves and with other receptors, including BKR2, underscoring complex regulatory
interactions and downregulation of ATR1 by ATR2 (Inuzuka et al. 2016).
We propose that the high level of the ATR2 receptor in children may compensate the
low ACE2 level for responding to increased levels of Ang1-8, in particular by defusing
the positive loops that amplify Ang1-8. Ang1-8 bound to the pro-inflammatory
receptor ATR1 upregulates ACE and downregulates ACE2 at the mRNA level (Koka et al.
2008) and upregulates ADAM17 that sheds ACE2 from cells (Deshotels et al. 2014),

thereby increasing its production rate by ACE and reducing its degradation by ACE2.
These regulatory loops require activation of ATR1, and they are hindered by high
expression of the alternative receptor ATR2. As the level of ATR2 decreases with age,
the positive feedback loops become stronger and may contribute to the increase of
Ang1-8 and in general the pro-inflammatory arm of the RAS across age (Yoon et al.
2016).
The role of interferons
It has been recently shown that type-I interferons (IFN-I) upregulate ACE2 expression
(Ziegler et al. 2020). Interestingly, IFN- are used as anti-inflammatory therapy in
multiple sclerosis (Kieseier 2011), supporting their anti-inflammatory role. We
conjecture that the upregulation of ACE2 by IFN-I may contribute to stop the
inflammatory cascade. This conjecture is consistent with the recent finding that autoantibodies against IFN- are associated with more severe forms of Covid-19 (Bastard
et al. 2020) and that impaired type-I IFN response (Hadjadj et al- 2020) and genetic
variants that hinder interferon activation (Zhang et al. 2020) are associated with severe
Covid cases. Moreover, mutations of the IFN-I receptor have been found to be risk
factors of severe Covid-19 through genome wide association studies (GWAS) analysis
(Pairo-Castineira et al. 2020). Finally, SARS-COV-2 infection is characterized by low
levels of IFN-I (Blanco-Melo et al. 2020), partly because the virus dysregulates IFN-I
(Konno et al. 2020). Therefore, we suggest that IFN downregulation cooperates with
ACE2 dysregulation by SARS_COV-2 in preventing the arrest of the inflammatory
process in severe Covid-19 cases. However, interferon therapy did not provide any
reduction of mortality or hospitalization in the Solidarity clinical trial (WHO Solidarity
Trial Consortium 2020).
Epigenetic enhancement of the inflammatory process
An increasing amount of evidence indicates that inflammation related genes in
general, and ACE2 in particular, are subject to epigenetic control through chromatin
modifications. Transcriptional memory provides faster and enhanced transcription
upon repeated stimulations, and it is a common hallmark of interferon-stimulated
genes, mediated by histone variants such as H3.3 and histone modifications that
favour transcription (Kamada et al. 2018) and by de-methylation of CpG islands at
active promoters, associated with sustained stimulation by the proinflammatory
cytokine TNF-α (Zhao et al. 2020).
The ACE2 gene has been shown to be subject to transcriptional memory through CpG
island demethylation that increases through age (Corley and Ndhlovu, 2020), and ACE2
transcription in samples of patients with comorbidities associated with severe COVID19 was correlated with the expression of genes related to histone modifications, such
as HAT1 (type B histone acetyltransferase involved in the acetylation of newly
synthesized histones), HDAC2 (histone deacetylase involved in transcriptional
repression) and KDM5B (histone demethylase involved in transcriptional repression)
(Pinto et al. 2020). Genome-wide CRISPR screens identified several chromatin

modifiers that facilitate SARS-COV-2 infection (Wei et al. 2020), likely by upregulating
ACE2: the gene HMGB1 encoding a DNA binding protein that regulates chromatin, the
SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complex that regulates chromatin accessibility and
gene expression, the histone demethylase KDM6A, the histone methyltransferase
KMT2D and the lysyl hydroxylase JMJD6, while the histone H3.3 chaperone complex
HUCA hindered viral infection, suggesting an anti-viral role for deposition of the
histone variant H3.3.
The transcriptional memory of the ACE2 gene has been interpreted by Pruimboom et
al. (2020) as evidence of a positive correlation between ACE2 expression and Covid-19
severity. However, it is important to note that the transcriptional memory also acts on
pro-inflammatory genes (Kamada et al. 2018; Zhao et al. 2020). The reported decrease
of the ACE2/ACE ratio in chronic inflammatory diseases associated with severe Covid19 (Li et al. 2020; Pagliaro and Penna 2020) suggests that the pro-inflammatory side
prevails in this balance, with the final result to decrease the ACE2/ACE ratio through
the transcriptional downregulation of ACE2 (Koka et al. 2008), which is also consistent
with the decrease of the ACE2/ACE ratio observed in ARDS (Wösten-van Asperen et al.
2013; Schouten et al. 2016) and with the theory of inflammaging, which postulate that
the increase through age of inflammatory processes contributes to the
phenomenology of aging and senescence (Franceschi et al. 2007; Minciullo et al. 2016).
Future work should address the complex regulation of ACE2 and other inflammatory
and anti-inflammatory genes from a system perspective, considering multiple level of
regulation (epigenetic, transcriptional, post-translational).
Therapeutic perspectives
Our hypothesis supports several candidate drugs that might alleviate severe
complications of CoViD-19 and even its post infection consequences (MIS-C and long
Covid-19) by inhibiting the processes that prevent the reversion of the inflammatory
state. Luckily for several of these drugs clinical trials are already on-going.
1) human recombinant ACE2. It can have a double protective effect. On one hand, it
can alleviate the inflammatory process, and in the other one it can sequester the virus
and difficult its entry in the cells (Batlle et al. 2020). A recent case report presents very
promising results, and clinical trials are ongoing (Zoufaly et al. 2020).
2) Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) that block the ATR1 receptor, downregulating
the inflammatory process and preventing the positive feedback loop of Ang1-8
through upregulation of ACE and downregulation of ACE2. They are often discussed
together with ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) that reduce the formation of Ang1-8. However,
ACE has anti-inflammatory effect on the KKS, where it downregulates bradykinin, so
that one of the known adverse effects of ACE-I is the upregulation of KKS eventually
leading to edema. Moreover, Ang1-8 can be also formed through other peptidases.
The possible therapeutic role of ARB and ACE-I was suggested by several groups
already at the time of SARS 2003 (Sun et al. 2020; Gurwitz 2020; Verdecchia et al.

2020; Ciaglia et al. 2020; Offringa et al. 2020; Annweiler et al. 2020). Although there
was the concern that, by upregulating ACE2, ARB and ACE-I might favour the virus,
meta-analysis of several clinical studies suggested that they are associated with lower
mortality of COVID-19 in patients with hypertension (odds ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.38–
0.84], Guo, Zhu and Hong 2020). The clinical trials NCT04312009 and NCT04311177 are
ongoing to test possible protective effects, although caution is necessary if blood
pressure becomes too low, which is a frequent consequence of severe Covid-19
(Michard and Vieillard‑Baron 2020, Lala et al. 2020), probably through the activation of
the bradykinin axis.
3) Drugs that enhance the ATR2 receptor. Their effect may be in principle similar to
ARB.
4) The product of ACE2, Ang1-7, which exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic
effects (Chappell MC and Zayadneh 2017) through the receptor Mas. However, its
mechanism of action is still not fully known, it is rapidly degraded by ACE, and it has a
moderate affinity for ATR1, thus it might produce effects contrary to the intentions;
5) IFN-I that upregulate ACE2. Although interferon may promote inflammation, IFN-β
(type I) is used as anti-inflammatory drug to treat multiple sclerosis (Kieseier 2011).
However, the Solidarity clinical trial did not observe any reduction of Covid-19
mortality upon IFN-I treatment (WHO Solidarity Trial Consortium 2020).
6) Other drugs that upregulate ACE2
7) Inhibitors of IL-1 and TNFalpha, which are successfully used to treat KD and MIS-C,
might also be useful to treat Covid-19 for preventing excessive activation of the KKS.
8) Vitamin D, which exerts a protective role by downregulating ATR1 and ADAM17, and
in this way limits the inflammatory process and protects ACE2 from excessive
shedding. A retrospective study of almost 5 million people found an association
between vitamin D deficiency and Covid-19 severity (Israel et al. 2020), and a clinical
study with 76 patients found that a high dose of Calcifediol, a metabolite of vitamin D,
significantly reduced the ICU treatment for hospitalized Covid-19 patients (EntrenasCastillo et al. 2020).
Of course, experimental verifications of the above hypothesis are necessary, and
clinical trials are urgently needed to test these therapeutic indications.
Conclusions
As reviewed above by us and elsewhere by many other authors, the peptidase ACE2,
besides being the cellular receptor of SARS-COV-2 and other coronavirus, exerts a
central regulatory role in inflammatory processes by downregulating the main proinflammatory peptides of the Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the Kinin kallikrein
system (KKS) (Fig.2). These two highly integrated signalling systems, whose receptors
act synergistically and strengthen each other, activate the inflammatory response,
activate cytokines starting from a central controller of inflammation such as TNF-,

which is activate by the same protease TACE/ADAM17 that degrades ACE2, and recruit
macrophages and neutrophils. We propose that the main role of ACE2 consists in
terminating this inflammatory process. Failure to do so, because of ACE2 degradation
or failure to activate it, may exacerbate the inflammatory response leading to organ
damage, including edema, and it may be responsible of the most severe consequences
of Covid-19 even after the infection has been resolved, as it happens in the Multiinflammatory syndrome of children (MIS-C).
Because of the central role of ACE2 both for SARS-COV-2 propagation and for
controlling the inflammatory process, and because of the very marked increase of
Covid-19 with age (Fig.1), a strong effort has been dedicated to elucidate how ACE2
expression change with age. However, these works have produced conflicting results,
that have been interpreted either as support of the theory that the receptor
expression favours SARS-COV-2 infection or as support of the opposite theory that high
ACE2 expression favours milder disease because of its anti-inflammatory role.
We have shown that these contrasting results on ACE2 expression across age can be
reconciled going beyond the dichotomy between adults and children and recognizing
that ACE2 expression does not change monotonically with age but it starts in late
foetal life, reaches a maximum at a young age that depends on the cell type and
exhibits strong inter-individual and inter-cellular variation, and decreases at advanced
age. At the protein level, this decrease starts before and it is more accentuated than at
the mRNA level, due to the increase with age of the activity of the protease
TACE/ADAM17 that sheds ACE2 from the cell membrane to the serum. This proposed
behaviour, represented in Fig.3A, is consistent with essentially all existing data on the
ACE2 expression across age in rodents and humans, except some of the figures of the
preprint by Inde et al. (2020).
The complexity and the intricacies of ACE2 regulation will require future approaches
that integrate multiple regulatory levels, from chromatin remodelling that plays a key
role in transcriptional memory to regulation through transcription factors and posttranslational regulation through ADAM17 and other proteases that degrade ACE2. This
is an important subject, since the decrease of ACE2 with age, and the simultaneous
increase of the pro-inflammatory components of the RAS may play an important role
in the theory of inflammaging, which postulate that the increase through age of
inflammatory processes contributes to the phenomenology of aging and senescence
(Franceschi et al. 2007; Minciullo et al. 2016).
The proposed decrease of ACE2 across age, and the observed decrease of the
ACE2/ACE ratio in chronic inflammatory diseases often associated with severe Covid19 (Li et al.2020; Pagliaro and Penna 2020) support a negative relationship between
Covid-19 severity and ACE2 expression (Fig.3B). This is not as paradoxical as it seems,
since a mathematical model of virus propagation across cells predicts that an increase
of the receptor level does not necessarily accelerate viral propagation and it may even
slow it down (Ortega-Cejas et al. 2004; see Fig.4 for illustration).

The exception to this proposed negative relationship is constituted by children, who
express less ACE2 than adults and experience much milder disease. However, in
children the RAS is much less dis-balanced towards the pro-inflammatory side than in
adults. In particular children express more than adults the alternative angiotensin
receptor ATR2, that exerts an anti-inflammatory role by downregulating the proinflammatory receptor ATR1, competing with it for angiotensin II binding, and reducing
the positive feedbacks that downregulate ACE2 and enhance its degradation by
ADAM17.
Of course, experimental work is needed for supporting the hypothesis presented in
this review, but we hope that they may help rationalizing apparently conflicting
observations.
