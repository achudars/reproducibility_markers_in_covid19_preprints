Abstract: To combat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the world has vaccination,
plasma therapy, herd immunity, and epidemiological interventions as few possible options. The COVID19 vaccine development is underway and it may take a significant amount of time to develop the vaccine
and after development, it will take time to vaccinate the entire population, and plasma therapy has some
limitations. Herd immunity can be a plausible option to fight COVID-19 for small countries. But for a
country with huge population like India, herd immunity is not a plausible option, because to acquire herd
immunity approximately 67% of the population has to be recovered from COVID-19 infection, which
will put an extra burden on medical system of the country and will result in a huge loss of human life.
Thus epidemiological interventions (complete lockdown, partial lockdown, quarantine, isolation, social
distancing, etc.) are some suitable strategies in India to slow down the COVID-19 spread until the vaccine
development. Government of India (GOI) and different state governments have made many efforts to
mitigate the COVID-19 spread under various scenarios through the intervention and public awareness. In
this work, we have suggested the SIR model with intervention, which incorporates the epidemiological
interventions in the classical SIR model. To model the effect of the interventions, we have introduced as
the intervention parameter. is a cumulative quantity which covers all type of intervention. We have also
discussed the supervised machine learning approach to estimate the transmission rate
for the SIR
model with intervention from the prevalence of COVID-19 data in India and some states of India. To
validate our model, we present a comparison between the actual and model-predicted number of COVID19 cases. In most cases, we find the predicted numbers of cases are very much close to the actual number
of cases, but there is some mismatch between the predicted and actual number of cases due to irregular
imposed intervention, uneven demographic distribution, personal behavior, and individual negligence.
Using our model, we also present predicted numbers of active and recovered COVID-19 cases till Sept
30, 2020, for the entire India and some states of India and also estimate the 95% and 99% confidence
interval for the predicted cases.

1. Introduction
A disease that quickly spreads within a short period to a large population in a certain region is called an
epidemic. Epidemics occur because of several internal and external factors such as a genetic change in the
pathogen reservoir, a change in the ecology, or the entering the developing pathogen in a host population.
An epidemic may be restricted to one particular place or spread to other places in a short period. An
epidemic is termed as pandemic if it spreads to several countries and affects a large number of people
globally [1]. Today, the world has become small with the availability of faster transportation. People can
move from one place to another place in a short time.

In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, the capital
city of China’s Hubei province [2]. COVID-19 is characterized as an infectious disease and it occurs due
to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [3] and it spreads among people
through close contact with infected individuals generally via small droplets produced by sneezing,
coughing, or talking. COVID-19 can also spread through the infected surface if someone touches the
infected surface and touches his/her nose, mouth, or eyes. World Health Organization (WHO) declared
the COVID-19 outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30,
2020, and on March 11, 2020, declared as a pandemic of infectious disease [4]. On July 07, 2020, the
WHO [5] acknowledged that the evidence emerging of the airborne spread of the COVID-19 in the air
under certain conditions.
In India, the first case of COVID-19, who had returned from Wuhan, China, was reported
positive on January 30, 2020, in Kerala [6]. Following that two more cases were reported in Kerala on
Feb 02, 2020, and Feb 03, 2020. Approximately a month later on March 02, 2020, new cases of COVID19 were reported. Gradually the disease spread in India and became an epidemic. To fight with the
COVID-19 emergency, India has Vaccination, Herd Immunity, Plasma Therapy, and Epidemiological
Interventions as few possible options.
Although the COVID-19 vaccine development is underway and it may take a significant amount
of time to develop the vaccine [7]. Currently, the University of Oxford, Jhonson & Jhonson, National
Institute of Virology (India), Cansino Biologics Inc. (China) are some organizations working to develop
the vaccine. Even after the development of the vaccine, the production and dissemination of vaccines is a
very challenging task. In India, with an approximate current population of 135 crores, if we vaccinate 10
lakh people per day it will take more than three years to vaccinate the whole population of India.
Producing ten lakh vaccines per day and then vaccinating the same number of people is a mammoth task.
Herd immunity or community immunity is an idea from epidemiology. Herd immunity gained
more attention for COVID-19 after a remark from England’s Prime Minister Borris Jhonson. In herd
immunity, a large fraction of the population has acquired immunity against the virus. The fraction of the
immune population depends on the value of the reproduction ratio [8]. In various researches [9, 10, 11] it
has been found that for COVID-19 an approximately 67% of the population is required to be immune
against the disease to gain herd immunity. There are two possible ways to gain herd immunity either after
recovery from infection or through vaccination. Presently in the absence of the vaccine, we have the only
option of immunity after recovery. Herd immunity can be a plausible option to fight COVID for small
countries. But for India, Herd immunity is not a very promising alternative. With a 2-3% fatality rate and
herd immunity requirement of 67%, India will face huge human life loss during the course of acquiring
herd immunity.
Convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) is also being considered as a treatment of COVID-19. In the
CPT, blood plasma from a recently recovered patient is transfused in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19
neutralizing antibodies are present in the donor’s plasma increases the recipient’s immune response
against the disease. As suggested by ICMR this therapy is being used as last resort on the compassionate
ground by hospitals in severe COVID-19 cases. The Indian government and state governments have
started collecting plasma for the treatment. Finding a suitable donor is a challenging task. Moreover, CPT
is being used for severe patients so it is not a very viable treatment option.
So from the above discussion, vaccination is the most effective way to win over COVID-19. Till
date there is no vaccine for COVID-19, prevention is the only cure we have. To control the spread of
COVID-19, some recommended preventive measures are hand washing, maintaining physical social

distance, wearing a face mask in public places, and personal protective equipment (PPE) [12]. The
monitoring and self-isolation/quarantined are also recommended for people who feel some symptoms
with COVID-19. The worldwide countries have responded by implementing travel restrictions,
lockdowns, and school/college and facility closures.
In the absence of the COVID-19 vaccine, the preventive measures, effective treatments, and
interventions such as lockdown are a key part of handling the COVID-19, which will help to reduce the
new COVID-19 infected cases and delay the peak that is the turning point of COVID-19 cases. This is
known as flattening the curve. The interventions reduce the new infected COVID-19 cases which help the
healthcare services to better manage the same volume of the patients [13].
India has declared COVID-19 outbreak as an epidemic in some states and union territories, and as
per the preventive measures, many commercial institutions and the educational institutions have been shut
down. A 14-hour voluntary public curfew at the instance of the honorable prime minister of India has
declared on March 22, 2020. Further to control the COVID-19 outbreak, on March 24, 2020, the
honorable prime minister announced a first complete lockdown nationwide for 21 days up to April 14,
2020 [14]. On April 14, 2020, the honorable prime minister extended the ongoing nationwide complete
lockdown till May 03, 2020. Further, on May 01, 2020, the government of India extended nationwide
complete lockdown till May 17, 2020. All the districts of states divided into three zones: green, red, and
orange zones based on present and past active COVID-19 cases and some relaxations applied according
to the zones [15]. On May 17, 2020, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), India further
extended lockdown till May 31 [16]. After then the lockdown restrictions were started to lift with some
conditions, which is termed as unlocking. The first phase of unlocking, “unlock 1.0” was announced from
June 1, 2020, to June 30, 2020, and further “unlock 2.0” declared from July 01, 2020, to July 31, 2020,
with more ease of restrictions [17]. In the unlock phase, the services are resumed in a phased manner that
is the partial lockdown.
These nationwide lockdown and partial lockdown have slowed the transmission rate of COVID19 and so delay the peak of the infectious disease, resulting in the less number of COVID-19 cases in
India. Complete lockdown, partial lockdowns, or other types of intervention restrictions were as
aggressive for containing the spread and building necessary healthcare infrastructure in India. The
government of India got time to building special COVID-19 hospital and emergency investment in health
care, fiscal stimulus, investment in the vaccine, and drug. But, due to nationwide lockdowns, the Indian
economy has been severely affected. The maximum impact of this intervention is expected to be on daily
wage workers and those below the poverty line.
In the context of India, India is the second most populous country in the world. As per the India
census 2011 data, 68.84 % of India’s population lives in rural areas while 31.16 % stay in urban areas. In
northeast India, the population density is low in comparison to other states of India. Most of the
population residing in rural areas is more isolated and maintained the physical social distance in the
comparison of urban areas. The villages in the rural areas are separated by a few kilometers and the rural
area markets are not as crowded as compared to urban areas. This helps to maintain the physical social
distance in the rural area. During the lockdown period, due to the unavailability of work, migrant laborers
started to return to their native places. The maximum of these migrant workers belongs to rural areas. To
reduce the risk of spread COVID-19 in rural areas governments decided to impose mandatory 14 days
quarantine at a public facility that helped to restrict the disease.
The epidemiological interventions are key measures to curb the COVID-19 spread and reduce
new COVID-19 cases. COVID-19 transmission occurs through close contact with infected individuals. A

susceptible person can come near a COVID-19 infected person at the workplace, school/college,
household, market, crowded place, or in the community. The chance of getting infection depends on the
spatial distance between the contacts. Individual personal behavior (social distancing, frequent hand
sanitization, and wearing a mask, etc.) also plays a key role to control the COVID-19 spread. Personal
rather than government preventive actions are more important to save individuals form infection. In the
case of COVID-19 infection, self-isolation, maintaining physical social distancing, and seeking medical
advice are very helpful as the symptom appears.
Epidemiological models are very helpful to understand the spread dynamics of an epidemic.
These models for infectious disease are used to predict the spread rate of the disease, the duration of the
disease, and the peak of the infectious disease. These models can be used for short term and long term
predictions for the infectious disease that may be used in decision making to optimize possible controls
from the infectious disease. This in turn helps to public health intervention. In literature, several
mathematical models for infectious diseases have been introduced. These models categorized into
collective models and network models [18] as two main groups. Logistic models [19], generalized growth
models [20], Richards’s models [21], sub epidemics wave models [22], Susceptible-Infected-Recovered
(SIR) model [23], and Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) models belong in the group of
collective models. The SIR model is a compartmental model where the whole population considered a
closed population and this closed population is divided into three compartments that are susceptible,
infected, and recovered. Some infected persons with diseases are introduced to the population. These
infected persons infect some other persons who are susceptible during their sickness at an average rate ,
which is known as the basic reproduction number.
Recently, some works have been reported in the literature using the SIR model to predict the
COVID-19 outbreak. Among these works, Sourish Das [24] has estimated the basic reproduction number
for the SIR model using statistical machine learning approaches and make the prediction of COVID19 for India. Ndiaye et al. [25] have analyzed the COVID-19 by the SIR model and machine learning
techniques for forecasting the spread of COVID-19 in the world. Further, a comparative prediction of
COVID-19 confirmed cases with deterministic and stochastic SIR models and machine learning
approaches has been studied by Ndiaye et al. [26]. Liu et al. [27] have studied and predicted the COVID19 cumulative number of cases in China where the early reported cases are used. Chen et al. [28]
introduced the time-dependent SIR model for COVID-19 with the assumption that the transmission rate
and recovery rate ) varying with time and estimated these parameters by ridge regression. To
determine the COVID-19 transmission rate, a time-dependent state-space SIR model has been proposed
by Deo et al. [29] proposed which incorporate the intervention for prediction of COVID-19 in India. In
literature, some other works have been reported to incorporate the impact of interventions [7, 30, 31].
In this work, we introduce the impact of the intervention in the SIR model and suggested a model
named, the SIR model with intervention to study the COVID-19 spread in India. And, also discussed a
machine learning approach to estimate the transmission rate ) for the SIR model with the intervention
from the prevalence reported COVID-19 cases in India. We determined the intervention value
with fitting the model predicted COVID-19 cases with actual reported COVID-19 cases. The impact of
different levels of interventions is demonstrated in our work. We also present a prediction of COVID-19
active and recovered cases for entire India and some states of India.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2, describes the basic SIR model. The
proposed SIR model with intervention is presented in section 3. The linear regression method is explained
in section 4 and further, the estimation of the transmission rate is defined in section 5. In section 6, we

introduce the COVID-19 dataset and demography of India. In section 7, we present our analysis and
prediction of the COVID-19 progression in India. Finally, the conclusion has made in section 8.
2. SIR Model
The SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) is a compartmental model in epidemiology, introduced by
Kermack and McKendrick [23]. It is a mathematical model which tells how an infectious disease spreads
through a population during a period. In this model, the whole population size
of country or location
is considered as constant and divided into three compartments with labels Susceptible
, Infectious ,
and Recovered
that varies with the time . The natural death and birth that is the demography are
not considered in the SIR model, because the period of the infectious disease is much shorter than the
human lifetime. The people who belong in the population may progress between different compartments,
shown in Fig. 1 and corresponding changes occur in terms of two parameters and .

Fig. 1: SIR model diagram
The SIR model is described in the following set of differential equations as [23]:

{
where:
: Number of individuals susceptible but not yet to infected with an infectious disease at time
: Number of infected individuals at time and can spread the infectious disease to susceptible
individuals
: Number of recovered (or deceased) individuals at time and assumed to be immune for life
: Transmission rate through the exposure of the infectious disease
:
Rate of recovering from the infectious disease, and ⁄ is the mean period during which an
infected individual can pass it on
From the Eq. (1), it can be seen that

which implies that

.

Each susceptible individual contacts people per day with a fraction ⁄ which are infectious, and
⁄ move out of the susceptible compartment and goes into the infectious compartment. The
parameter is the rate of recovery and

⁄
recovered compartment.
is the basic reproduction number and it denotes the expected number of
new infectious from a single infected person in a population where all subjects are susceptible. If
,
one infected person infects an average of one person that is the spread of infectious disease is stable, and
means a single infected person infects an average of two people. If
this indicates one
infected person infects on average less than one person and spread of infectious disease is expected to
stop, and if
this means an infected person infects on average more than one person spread of
disease is increasing in the absence of an intervention. It is demonstrated in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2: Demonstration of

and infectious disease spread [32]

The SIR model tries to predict the total number of infected persons or duration for infectious diseases that
are spread from human to human. It is generally run with ordinary differential equations, which is a
deterministic model and it can be also used with a stochastic (random) context.
⁄ is a challenging
In the SIR model, the determination of the basic reproduction number
task for COVID-19 infectious disease. The recovery rate for the COVID-19 infectious disease is
considered as on average 14 days [7, 24]. In our study, we have considered the value of ⁄
. To
determine the value of , we have estimated the transmission rate
, which is described in section 5.

Here, we demonstrate the SIR model for a sample population size 1
with initially five
infected persons with the disease. At time

Let the transmission rate

reproduction number
. The SIR model graph with infected, recovered, and susceptible cases is
shown in Fig. 3.

Initially, susceptible cases (Fig. 3) decrease slowly that may be the incubation period of infectious
disease. It decreases rapidly after 14 days, which shows that the susceptible persons move out from the
susceptible compartment and goes into the infectious compartment. The infected persons are shown by
the red curve (Fig. 3). Initially, five people exposed in the closed population and with
, and it
infected more than
persons per day in 48 days, which is the peak for the infectious disease. The
infected persons start recovered from the disease, shown in the green curve (Fig. 3) that is moving out
from the infectious compartment to the recovered compartment. After around 42 days the number of
recovered people increases as compared to infected people.
3. SIR Model with intervention
As we discussed the classical SIR model in section 2, which is based on the assumption that the whole
population is closed and does not consider any intervention such as complete lockdown, partial lockdown,
isolation, quarantine, and social distancing, etc. In the scenario of the traditional SIR model where no
interventions are assumed, infected individuals can infect other people with the transmission rate and
COVID-19 infection disease will survive for a longer period and eventually die out as most of the
population either have recovered or removed. But in reality, this intervention affects the transmission rate
for COVID-19 spread. Suppose in the closed population, if
person being infected with the
COVID-19 and immediately these
infected persons tested positive and have been isolated
themselves/quarantined from the entire population, then no other person will get the infection from these
5 persons and infection disease may die out. To incorporate this intervention in the SIR model, we
introduced the factor
with transmission rate where is the value of the intervention. is a
cumulative quantity which covers all type of intervention. The SIR model with the intervention factor can
be defined as:

{
The value of intervention lie in the interval [ ], where
denotes there is no intervention and
denotes there is a complete intervention. Other levels of intervention
. For
, the SIR
model with intervention reproduces the classical SIR model. For the case,
means there is a
complete intervention, the factor
becomes zero, this implies that
and no further
new infected cases will occur. The infected person will be recovering and infection will die soon.
The SIR model with intervention for a sample population size 1
with initially five COVID-19
⁄
infected persons is demonstrated in Fig. 4. Let
and

When
, the SIR model with intervention reduces to the classical SIR model as discussed in
section 2, with the same parameters, and also shown in Fig. 4(a). In the case of complete intervention
, the factor
, and from Eq. (2) we obtained
, which is also experimentally
demonstrated in Fig. 4(e) that is the susceptible cases become constant which is
. No progress from the
susceptible compartment to the infectious compartment and infected person will recover and move out to
the recovered compartment, which is shown in Fig. 4(f), where five infected persons recovered in around
25 days and no new infected persons reported. Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 4(c) represents the SIR model with
intervention
and
. For
, the maximum number of newly infected cases is
on
a single day, which is peak value that is the turning point, which occurred at
days and disease will
die out in
days. However, for
, the maximum number of infected cases is
on a single day,
which is peak value for this case, which occurred at
days and disease will die out in 262 days. As
we take the large intervention value, suppose
, shown in Fig. 4(d), the infectious disease will die
out in
days and the maximum number of infected per day is which the initial infected value at the
time
. In this case with the considered parameters, it can be observed that as the intervention
value
], the number of infected cases per day decreases and peak value also take more days and
disease die out takes time. However, when intervention value
, the infectious diseases die out
soon and newly infected cases per day also decrease. The small level of intervention slowed the growth of

the COVID-19 pandemic and flatting the curve and more level of an intervention force to restrict and
pandemic soon die out. The objective of epidemiologists to helping the government’s policymakers to
minimize the new COVID-19 cases and associated mortality, delay the pandemic peak that will help to
manage the health care and effort of the economy at the manageable level to wait for vaccine and
manufacturing at large scale. For this how many levels of intervention should manageable.
4. Linear regression
Linear regression is a linear approach to find the relationship between one dependent variable or response
variable and one independent variable or predictor variable. And, the multiple linear regressions are an
approach, which find the linear relationship between one dependent variable and more than one
independent variable [33]. Linear regression is widely used in many fields to describe possible
relationships between variables. It also used in the in the field of machine learning as one of the
supervised machine learning algorithms. The relationships between the variables are defined using linear
predictor functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the training data. For an
independent variable
and a dependent variable
whose relationship is a straight line, the linear
regression model is defined as [33];

where
is known as intercept, and
is known as slope, are two unknown regression coefficients in the
linear regression. is a random error with mean zero and variance . The estimation of
and
should be in a straight line, which are the best fit to the considering data. For pairs of observation
, the linear regression model is defined as [33];

To make the linear regression algorithm more accurate, the minimization of the sum of least square error
between the predicted and actual value is described as:
∑
5. Estimation of transmission rate

∑
using linear regression from prevalence COVID-19 data

For the COVID-19 projection, transmission rate
is a difficult task to determine directly which
perfectly fit for the SIR model with intervention. In literature, some works have been reported to
measures the parameters from the early data with the inverse problem in epidemiology [34, 35, 36].
To estimate transmission rate
, we have considered prevalence reported COVID-19 infected
cases from India. In the deterministic case, the differential equation
where
and
cases during the time of course and
(1), it is written as:

is written as

days. Here
is the cumulative sum of infected active
are the infected active persons per day. From the differential Eq.

After simplifying, it can be written as:
(

)

With prevalence COVID-19 data, we have determined the linear equation, where time/days are
independent variable and are the dependent variables, using linear regression to estimate the value of
transmission rate
for the COVID-19 prediction. The sklearn, package of Python is used for estimating
value using a linear model and 10 cross-validations are utilized to obtain optimal value of .
6. COVID-19 data and demographics of India
6.1 COVID-19 Data
In this study, we obtained the COVID-19 data from COVID-19India.org [37] reported between June 05,
2020, and July 25, 2020. The number of confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases for states wise and
India are publicly available at COVID-19India [37]. It is a crowd-sourced open database for COVID-19
available online: https://api.covid19india.org/documentation/csv/
6.2 Demographics of India
India is the second most populous country in the world and it occupies 2.41% of the world land area and
accommodates 17.7 % World’s population. As per the India census 2011, India’s population is 121 crore.
Of 121 crore Indians, 68.84 % of India’s population lives in rural areas while 31.16 % stays in urban
areas, which are tabulated in Table 1 and also depicted in Fig. 5. India's population density as per the
census 2011 is 382 per square kilometer. Bihar is the most densely populated state (1102 persons/ km2)
followed by West Bengal (1029 persons/ km2) and Kerala (859 persons/ km2). Among India’s cities,
Mumbai is the largest populous metropolitan city in India, in 2018 and it accommodates 22.1 million
people, followed by Delhi with 28 million people and Kolkata.

7. Validation and prediction of COVID-19 active and recovered cases
In this section, we demonstrate the experiments using the proposed model i.e. the SIR model with
intervention on COVID-19 data. We have estimated the transmission rate
from the prevalence of
COVID-19 data. We also have validated as well as predicted the population of the infected and recovered
population in our model for some of the most affected states of India. The experimental results being
performed by using Python with panda [40], which is discussed in the following subsections:
7.1 Transmission rate (

estimation from prevalence data

To find a more accurate value the transmission rate
for the SIR model with intervention is a
challenging task for the COVID-19. In this study, we have estimated the value of from the prevalence
reported COVID-19 cases in India for the duration of June 05, 2020, to July 25, 2020. Using Eq. (7), we
have calculated the for 50 days and then calculated the using the linear regression and machine
learning approaches. The sklearn, package of Python is used with a linear model and 10 cross-validations
to obtain the optimal value of . The estimated value of transmission rate ( for India from June 05,
2020, to July 25, 2020, is shown in Fig. 6. Using this approach, the value of transmission rate
is
estimated for India is 0.1738. The predicted values of the transmission rate ( for some states of India
are shown in Table 2.

7.2 Validation and Prediction of COVID-19 active and recovered cases
In our analysis, simulations are carried out on COVID-19 data with taking active infected and recovered
(including death cases) cases on July 25, 2020, as the initial value. Here we validated COVID-19 cases
from June 05, 2020, to July 25, 2020, and further predict the COVID-19 cases from July 25, 2020, to Sept
30, 2020. And, also find the confidence interval [41] for the predicted COVID-19 cases. For the
simulations, we have used the estimated values of the transmission rate
for India and some states of
India. Since, on average it takes
days to recover from COVID-19 infection, so we have taken recovery
⁄ in our experiments. In the coming subsections, our experimental results are discussed.
rate
7.2.1 India
For India, we find the transmission rate
and determine the optimal value of intervention
to
fit the SIR model with intervention on COVID-19 prevalence data from June 05, 2020, to July 25, 2020,
shown in Table 2. Fig. 7(a) shows the validation graph for actual and predicted active cases and Fig. 7(b)
shows the validation of actual and predicted recovered COVID-19 cases from earlier COVID-19 cases.
Predicted value by the SIR model with intervention is near the actual COVID-19 values for COVID-19
active cases and recovered cases. Due to diversity in India, different types of interventions have been
implemented during the unlock phase of lockdown. In some states are still imposing full or partial
lockdown and also depend on peoples living in the urban and rural areas. As 68.84% of the total
population lives in the rural area (Table 1 and Fig. 5) which is generally isolated and mostly depends on
the agriculture profession. Further, with the same parameters, predicted the number of infected and
recovered cases for India till Sept 30, 2020, shown in Fig. 8 and depicted in Table 3. As per the present
scenario, India will witness 28.5 lakhs COVID-19 active cases and 72.2 lakhs recovered cases till Sept 30,
2020. Also estimate the 95% and 99% confidence interval for the predicted and recovered COVID-19
cases, depicted in Table 3. The estimated 95% and 99% confidence interval for the predicted COVID-19
active cases are [1145915, 1466626] and [1095527, 1517014] respectively till Sept 30, 2020.

7.2.2

Uttar Pradesh

Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state in India with a density of 828 people per square kilometer and
77.73% of the populations are residing in the rural area according to census 2011, depicted in Table 1.
This makes controlling the COVID-19 outbreak in Uttar Pradesh is a challenging task. The estimated
transmission rate
for Uttar Pradesh is 0.1908 and we find the optimal intervention value
with fitting the actual COVID-19 cases from June 05, 2020, to July 25, 2020, shown in Table 2. Fig. 9(a)
and Fig. 9(b) shows the validation of predicted and actual cases of COVID-19 active cases and recovered
cases respectively, and it also shows that actual and predicted cases are in close agreement. Uttar
Pradesh's government also initiated to spread awareness about COVID-19 among the people through
posters and banners. Also during India’s unlock phase, Uttar Pradesh government initiated the weekend
(Saturday and Sunday) lockdown from July 11, 2020, to check the COVID-19 spread [42] as the complete
lockdown affect the economy of the state. Further, we predict till Sept 30, 2020, of COVID-19 active and
recovered cases with assuming the same parameters used in the validation, represented in Fig. 10 and in
Table 3 along with 95% and 99% confidence interval estimation. On Sept 30, 2020, the number of
COVID-19 active cases will be about
lakhs, and recovered cases will be around 4.60 lakhs in Uttar
Pradesh. Table 3, shows that 95% and 99% confidence interval for the predicted COVID-19 active cases
are [73132, 99827] and [68938, 104021] respectively for Uttar Pradesh till Sept 30, 2020.

7.2.3 Maharashtra
Maharashtra is the second most populous state in India with a population density of 365 people per square
kilometer and 45.22% of population is residing in the urban area according to census 2011. Maharashtra
accounts for nearly one-third of the total COVID-19 cases in India with about 40% of all deaths [43].
Mumbai in Maharashtra is the largest metropolis and the most populous city, also worst-affected with
COVID-19 city in India. Because of rising COVID-19 cases, during India’s unlocking phase, the
Maharashtra government has extended the lockdown with some relaxation in the entire state till Aug 31,
2020 [44, 45]. In the case of Maharashtra, we estimated the transmission rate
, and with
fitting the actual COVID-19 cases from June 05, 2020, to July 25, 2020, we determine the intervention
value
, shown in Table 2. The validation of actual and predicted cases using the SIR model
with intervention for active COVID-19 and recovered cases is shown in Fig. 11(a) and Fig. 11(b)
respectively. The actual and predicted results are almost similar but for recovered cases, the actual and
predicted case shows a slight high variation. Here, the predicted recovered cases also include the deceased
case whereas the actual recovered cases considered only recovered cases. A further prediction is made

until Sept 30, 2020, with the same parameters which are shown in Fig. 12 and Table 3. The confidence
intervals for active and recovered cases are estimated and shown in Table 3. On Sept 30, 2020, COVID19 active and recovered cases will be less than 6.84 lakhs and 18.9 lakhs respectively in Maharashtra. The
estimated 95% and 99% confidence interval for predicted COVID-19 active cases are [311399, 384900]
and [299851, 396448] respectively.

7.2.4 Tamil Nadu
Tamil Nadu is the sixth most populous state in India and 48.4% of people are living in the urban areas
which are more crowded than the rural area, and managing the social distance is difficult in comparison to
the rural population. Chennai, the capital city of Tamil Nadu is the fourth largest populous metropolitan
in India. Tamil Nadu has recorded the second-highest number of cases in India and Chennai city being the
worst affected [37]. More than half of the confirmed cases in Tamil Nadu are from Chennai. To curb the
COVID-19 spread, the Tamil Nadu government has extended the lockdown with some relaxation in the
entire state till Aug 31, 2020 [46]. For Tamil Nadu, we estimated the transmission rate
from
the prevalence COVID-19 cases from June 25, 2020, to July 25, 2020, and determined the intervention

value
to fit the SIR model with intervention, and depicted in Table 2. Fig. 13(a) and Fig.
13(b) show the validation graph of predicted and actual cases for active cases and recovered cases. Till
July 17, 2020, the actual cases are more than the predicted cases. With the same parameter setting, we did
the prediction for Tamil Nadu, shown in Fig. 14 and depicted in Table 3. At the current rate of growth,
Tamil Nadu will witness 2.06 lakhs active COVID-19 cases and 6.9 lakh recovered cases till Sept 30,
2020. The estimated confidence intervals for predicted active and recovered cases at level 95% and 99%
are also tabulated in Table 3.

7.2.5 West Bengal
West Bengal is the fourth most populous state in India with a population density of 1029 per square
kilometer (Table 1) and Kolkata is the third most populous city in India. 68.13 % of people of West
Bengal are residing in rural areas that are less crowded compared to the urban area. To combat the
COVID-19, the West Bengal government has implemented the complete lockdown in July 2020 and
selected day’s complete lockdown in August 2020 with some relaxation in the entire state [47, 48]. We

estimate the transmission rate
for West Bengal from prevalence data from June 05, 2020, to
July 25, 2020, and determine the intervention value
with fitting the actual cases by the SIR
model with intervention, display in Table 2. The validation of actual and predicted cases using the SIR
model with intervention for active COVID-19 and recovered cases are shown in Fig. 15(a) and Fig. 15(b)
respectively. Prediction for West Bengal is shown in Fig. 16 and depicted in Table 3 with the same
parameters. At the current rate of growth, West Bengal will witness 1.54 lakh active COVID-19 cases and
3.47 lakh recovered cases till Sept 30, 2020. For predicted active and recovered COVID-19 cases, the
confidence interval is also estimated, shown in Table 3. The estimated 95% and 99% confidence interval
for predicted COVID-19 active cases are [55267, 73253] and [52441, 76079] respectively.

7.2.6 Telangana
In Telangana, 61.12% of people are residing in the rural area and population density is 312 per square
kilometer (Table 1). From the prevalence COVID-19 data from June 05, 2020, to July 25, 2020, we
estimate the transmission rate
and further determine the intervention value
with fitting the SIR model with intervention with the actual COVID-19 cases, shown in Table 2. Fig.
17(a) and Fig. 17(b) represent the validation graph of the predicted and actual COVID-19 cases. The
predicted and actual cases show that variation because of different interventions implemented during the
period. With the same parameter discussed above, the prediction has made till Sept 30, 2020, shown in
Fig. 18 and represented in Table 3. With the present growth scenario, Telangana will witness 2.44 lakhs
COVID-19 active cases and 4.15 lakhs recovered cases till Sept 30, 2020. We have also estimated
confidence intervals for predicted active and recovered cases at level 95% and 99% for Telangana, which
are shown in Table 3.

7.2.7

Gujarat

In Gujarat, 57.4 % population is residing in rural areas with a population density of 308 people per square
kilometer (Table 1 and Fig. 5). The rural area is more separated in comparison to the urban area and also
population density is low. To combating from the COVID-19, isolation is a key approach and also
depends on people's behavior. For Gujarat, we estimated the transmission rate
and
determined the intervention value
with fitting the predicted COVID-19 cases by the SIR model
with intervention with the actual COVID-19 cases from the prevalence COVID-19 data during June 05,
2020, to July 25, 2020, and shown in Table 2. Fig. 19(a) and Fig. 19(b) represent the validation graph of
the predicted and actual COVID-19 cases for active and recovered cases respectively from prevalence
data. With the same parameter discussed above, the prediction has made till Sept 30, 2020, shown in Fig.
20 and also depicted in Table 3. Gujarat will have about 44656 COVID-19 active cases and 1.61 lakhs
recovered cases till Sept 30, 2020, if the current situation prevails. Also estimated 95% and 99%,
confidence interval for predicted active and recovered cases for Gujarat, depicted in Table 3. The
estimated 95% and 99% confidence interval for predicted COVID-19 active cases are [23118, 27475] and
[22434, 28160] respectively.

7.2.8

Bihar

According to the 2011 India census (Table 1), Bihar is the third most populous and most densely
populated state of India with 1,106 persons per square kilometer. 88.71 % population of Bihar is residing
in the rural area and it is the second lowest urbanized state in India. The major proportion of the
population in Bihar resides in the villages which is more isolated. Bihar is under complete lockdown since
Mar 2020 with some relaxation [49]. Bihar has the largest population of migrant laborers in India. During
the national lockdown, a lot of migrant workers returned their homes in Bihar as a result of the shutdown
of the industry and losing their jobs. In this situation, the Bihar government made the compulsory
quarantine to returning migrants. Under the complete lockdown scenario, we estimate the transmission
rate
and determine the intervention value
with fitting the predicted COVID-19
cases by the SIR model with intervention with the actual COVID-19 cases from the prevalence COVID19 data during June 05, 2020, to July 25, 2020, shown in Table 2. Due to completer lockdown, the
intervention value is more for Bihar. Fig. 21(a) and Fig. 21(b) show the validation graph of the predicted
and actual COVID-19 cases for active and recovered cases respectively from prevalence data. There is
variation is the predicted and actual value which depends on the intervention imposed by the government
and individual behaviors. With the same parameter discussed above, the prediction has made till Sept 30,
2020, shown in Fig. 22 and also depicted in Table 3. If the present COVID-19 situation remains
unchanged, Bihar will witness about 1.01 lakhs COVID-19 active cases and 2.23 lakhs recovered cases
till Sept 30, 2020. Also estimated 95% and 99% confidence intervals for predicted active and recovered
cases for Bihar are depicted in Table 3. The confidence interval are [34885, 46840] and [33006, 48719]
for predicted active cases and [75843, 102196] and [71702, 106336] for the recovered cases at 95% and
99% level respectively.

7.2.9 Arunachal Pradesh
Arunachal Pradesh is a northeast state, where nearly 77% population are living in the rural area and
population density is about 17 people per square kilometer, second lowest population density state,
according to India census 2011 (Table 1). It is mostly isolated as being the more residing in the rural area
and population density is less. For Arunachal Pradesh, we estimate the transmission rate
and
determine the intervention value
with fitting the predicted COVID-19 cases by SIR model
with intervention with the actual COVID-19 cases from the prevalence COVID-19 data during June 05,
2020, to July 25, 2020, depicted in Table 2. Fig. 23(a) and Fig. 23(b) show the validation graph of the
predicted and actual COVID-19 cases for active and recovered cases respectively from prevalence data.
Predicted recovered cases show more than the actual cases. With the same parameter discussed above, the
prediction has made till Sept 30, 2020, shown in Fig. 24 and also depicted in Table 3. In the present
COVID-19 growth scenario, Arunachal Pradesh will witness not more than 23425 COVID-19 active
cases and 32083 recovered cases till Sept 30, 2020. Also estimated 95% and 99% confidence interval for
predicted active and recovered cases for Arunachal Pradesh depicted in Table 3. The estimated 95% and
99% confidence interval for predicted COVID-19 active cases are [5017, 7910] and [4562, 8364]
respectively.

7.2.10 Assam
As per the 2011 census, nearly 86% population of Assam is living in the rural area and the population
density of Assam is 397 people per square kilometer (Table 1). Assam government imposed the complete
lockdown in Guwahati from June 28, 2020, July 12, 2020, due to the rapid increase in the number of
COVID-19 cases in the city [50]. The government also enforced weekend lockdown from June 27, 2020,
in all towns. Guwahati city has been worse affected by COVID-19. We estimated the transmission rate
and determine the intervention value
with fitting the predicted COVID-19
cases by SIR model with intervention with the actual COVID-19 cases from the prevalence COVID-19
data during June 05, 2020, to July 25, 2020. Fig. 25(a) and Fig. 25(b) show the validation graph of the
predicted and actual COVID-19 cases for active and recovered cases respectively from prevalence data.
In our prediction till Sept 30, 2020, shown in Fig. 26 and also depicted in Table 3. Our model predicts
near about 72292 COVID-19 active cases and 1.62 lakhs recovered cases till Sept 30, 2020, in Assam.

8. Conclusion
At present, the COVID-19 outbreak is a potential threat due to its rapid spread behavior. It is more
threatening in India because the health facilities in India are low and India is a very densely populated
country. Among vaccination, herd immunity, plasma therapy, and epidemiological interventions to
combat with COVID-19, India has the only epidemiological interventions as the best possible option until
the vaccine become available. Keeping this in mind, we incorporate the intervention in the classical SIR
model and suggested the SIR model with intervention in this work. The supervised machine learning
approach to estimate the transmission rate
for the SIR model with intervention from the prevalence of
COVID-19 data in India and some states of India is also discussed. The work is implemented in Python

and the prediction of COVID-19 active and recovered cases with validation with the optimal value of
intervention for entire India and some states of India till Sept 30, 2020, have been made. We conclude our
analysis in the following points.
 The imposed intervention is implemented to flatting the curve for COVID-19 spread in India.
 The epidemiological intervention especially isolation and social distancing, and other preventive
measures are very effective to combat COVID-19 until the vaccine becomes available.
 There is a need for acceleration in tracing, testing, quarantining, isolating, and treating infected
persons with medical advice at the early stage of COVID-19 infected especially in the rural areas.
This will increase the value of which will reduce the effective transmission rate
resulting in a reduced infected population.
 The predicted COVID-19 active and recovered cases till Sept 30, 2020, for entire India and states:
Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Telangana, Gujarat, Bihar, Arunachal
Pradesh, and Assam are depicted in Table 3.
 Estimated the confidence intervals at level 95% and 99% for the predicted active and recovered
COVID-19 cases till Sept 30, 2020, depicted in Table 3.
