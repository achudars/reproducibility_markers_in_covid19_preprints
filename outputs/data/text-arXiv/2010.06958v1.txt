Abstract:
We study the spread of Covid-19 across neighbourhoods of cities in the developing world and find
that small numbers of neighbourhoods account for a majority of cases (𝑘-index~0.7). We also find
that the countrywide distribution of cases across states/provinces in these nations also displays
similar inequality, indicating self-similarity across scales. Neighbourhoods with slums are found
to contain the highest density of cases across all cities under consideration, revealing that slums
constitute the most at-risk urban locations in this epidemic. We present a stochastic network model
to study the spread of a respiratory epidemic through physically proximate and accidental daily
human contacts in a city, and simulate outcomes for a city with two kinds of neighbourhoods slum and non-slum. The model reproduces observed empirical outcomes for a broad set of
parameter values - reflecting the potential validity of these findings for epidemic spread in general,
especially across cities of the developing world. We also find that distribution of cases becomes
less unequal as the epidemic runs its course, and that both peak and cumulative caseloads are worse
for slum neighbourhoods than non-slums at the end of an epidemic. Large slums in the developing
world therefore contain the most vulnerable populations in an outbreak, and the continuing growth
of metropolises in Asia and Africa presents significant challenges for future respiratory outbreaks
from perspectives of public health and socioeconomic equity.

1. Introduction:
In the wake of the novel coronavirus Covid-19 pandemic that is currently sweeping the planet,
there is increasing concern over the impact on large urban slums in the developing world. This
concern primarily stems from the nature of dwelling arrangements in developing cities, where
large proportions of the population live in densely populated slums and shantytowns [1].
Broadly, slums are defined as “communities characterized by insecure residential status, poor
structural quality of housing, overcrowding, and inadequate access to safe water, sanitation, and
other infrastructure” [2]. This definition emphasizes the fact that slums house the poorest and
most vulnerable populations in cities. UN-Habitat estimated that over a third of the urban
population lived in slums in 2012-13, with significant geographical heterogeneity – the
proportion was 62% for sub-Saharan Africa and 35% for southern Asia, and 25% for Latin
America [1]. The sheer scale of slums is further exacerbated by the density of population in such
settlements. Table 1 presents some statistics on the density of living in some of the largest
metropolises of the developing world and shows that these cities have high average population
densities (and high slum populations), but individual slum neighbourhoods even within these
cities often show population densities an order of magnitude higher, suggesting significant intracity heterogeneity in densities of living.

Table 1: Densities of living in developing world metropolises and their slum neighbourhoods.

It is important to remember that the high population densities in developing cities are being
attained without building vertically (unlike cities like New York City, Seoul, or Tokyo), with
typical living conditions in slums described as small single room shacks (~10 𝑚2 ) with around 5
people living in them, situated adjacent to one another, and with up to 10 families sharing a
water tap and a pit latrine [3]. High population density achieved under such conditions therefore
creates an environment rife for epidemic spread through air or water. Our specific concern
relates to the spread of disease through such urban slums, which represent a critical feature of
urbanization in developing nations [1], especially in the context of infectious disease outbreaks

like Covid-19 where viral transmission is aided by increased population density, manifested as
more frequent person-to-person contact, crowded housing, and unsanitary environments [4, 5].
In this work, we use Covid-19 caseload data at a sub-city level (ward or neighbourhood or local
government level) to empirically characterize the spread of the epidemic across urban
neighbourhoods in six developing world metropolises, specifically to understand the nature of
infectious spread at fine-grained levels in contexts where slums are a salient feature of the urban
landscape. Based on this characterization, we explore the differential impacts of Covid-19 across
slum and non-slum neighbourhoods in these cities. In order to explore whether the observed
epidemy outcomes could be representative of other similar epidemics in developing urban
contexts, we create a network model to propagate the stochastic dynamics of the spread of
infection through an urban system (city) and estimate the differential impacts on slum and nonslum populations. Finally, we discuss the results obtained in the context of cities in the
developing world.

2. Evidence on impact of Covid-19 on cities and slums:
We focus our attention on six specific cities (Table 1) because they are amongst the primate
cities of the global south; are severely impacted by Covid-19; and have made available data at
the required level of local granularity to enable this fine-grained analysis. However, even for
many of these cities, data at the sub-city level is not released regularly and is only available
occasionally. We discuss all sources of data and constraints in Appendix 1. Table 2 provides
greater detail on the sub-city units we consider for the analysis.

We first study the distribution of cumulative caseloads across sub-city units (we will refer to
these sub-city units generally as neighbourhoods) for each of the six cities and find that cases
show an unequal distribution across neighbourhoods, with a high proportion of cases contained

in a small proportion of neighbourhoods - the top 20% of neighbourhoods, in terms of Covid-19
caseloads, account for 31% of cases in Mumbai, 69% in Cape Town, 58% in Rio de Janeiro,
50% in Dhaka, 65% in Lagos, and 55% in Manila respectively (Fig. 1, black). The emergence of
such a relationship across neighbourhoods in all cities under consideration - given the underlying
heterogeneity in terms of numbers of sub-city units, population scale of units, and total caseload
- suggests that the outcome is robust and representative of real underlying dynamics of infectious
spread. We characterize the unequal nature of this spread across neighbourhoods using the 𝑘index, which is a measure of inequality that generalizes Pareto’s 80-20 rule – that is, given the
cumulative distribution of an attribute (such as Covid-19 caseload) across a set of entities (such
as neighbourhoods), the 𝑘-index has the property that (1 − 𝑘𝑓 ) proportion of entities contain 𝑘𝑓
proportion of the attribute [6]. We find that, apart from Mumbai (𝑘𝑓 = 0.57), all other cities have
much higher 𝑘𝑓 ~ 0.70 (𝑘𝑓 for Cape Town, Rio de Janeiro, Dhaka, Lagos, and Manila are
0.75, 0.70, 0.68, 0.74, 0.70 respectively), meaning that ~30% of the neighbourhoods in these
cities account for ~70% of reportedcases. We also study the time evolution of the distribution of
cases in these cities, considering two points in time that are around a month apart (subject to data
availability as highlighted in Appendix 1), and find that the 𝑘-index of the distribution appears to
decrease over time for most cities (Mumbai, Cape Town, and Lagos), while it remains consistent
for Rio de Janeiro and Dhaka, and marginally increases for Manila (Fig. 1, red).

(May 30), Cape Town (May 20), Rio de Janeiro (June 16), Dhaka (June 3), Lagos (April 7), and Manila
(June 8). The 𝑘-index appears to decline over time.

When we explore the distribution of Covid-19 caseload across states or provinces within the
countries containing these six cities, we again find that 𝑘𝑓 ~0.70, which is very similar to the 𝑘index observed for caseload distribution within these cities. The distribution of cases across the
states of India, states of Brazil, states of Nigeria, provinces of South Africa, and districts of
Bangladesh yield 𝑘-indices of 0.77, 0.65, 0.75, 0.70, and 0.76 respectively (we were unable to
find province level data for Philippines). Therefore, the distribution of caseload across
states/provinces in nations mirrors the distribution across neighbourhoods in cities, indicating
self-similar behaviour across scales.
Given this unequal distribution, we now explore the characteristics of neighbourhoods that have
the highest caseloads. Our current understanding of Covid-19 suggests that physical proximity is
an important determinant of local spread. Therefore, we study caseloads across neighbourhoods
in all six cities, with a focus on differential impacts of Covid-19 on high density neighbourhoods
with slums, and other neighbourhoods. In order to do this, we first map large slum settlements in
these cities to the appropriate sub-city unit; it is important to note that given the high levels of

slum population in these cities (and, generally, in cities across the developing world) almost all
neighbourhoods have pockets of slums, so we label as ‘neighbourhoods with slums’ those subcity units which show a high concentration of slums as revealed by slum mapping exercises
(detailed in Appendix 2). The resulting list of neighbourhoods with slums across the 6 cities is:
11 out of 23 wards in Mumbai (G-North - containing the Dharavi slum, G-South, F-South, L, N,
H-East, M-East, M-West, K-East, K-West, P-North); 8 out of 58 suburbs/townships in Cape
Town (Khayelitsha, Mitchells Plain, Gugulethu, Delft, Philippi, Nyanga, Langa, Mfuleni); 41 out
of 163 bairros in Rio de Janeiro (Rocinha, Jacarezihno, Mare, Cidade de Deus, Complexo do
Alemao, Mangueira, Penha, Acari, Tijuca, Costa Barros, Ramos, Benfica, Pavuna, Encantado,

Coelho, Magalhaes Bastos, Realengo, Bangu, Jacarepagua, Andarai, Bras de Pina, Honorio
Gurgel, Engenho Novo, Turiacu, Padre Miguel, Coelho Neto, Engenho de Dentro); 12 out of 41
thanas in Dhaka (Mirpur, Gulshan - containing the Korail slum, Mohammadpur, Jatrabari,
Lalbagh, Sutrapur, Chak Bazar, Gendaria, Hazaribagh, Kotwali, Kamrangir Char, Shyampur); 5
out of 16 LGAs in Lagos (Agege, Ajeromi-Ifelodun, Mushin, Somolu, Lagos Island, and Lagos
Mainland - containing the floating Makoko slum); and 2 out of 17 districts in Manila (Tondo and
San Andres).
We find, in line with expectations, that average population densities of neighbourhoods with
slums are much higher than other neighbourhoods (Fig. 2a, neighbourhoods with slums – red,
other neighbourhoods - blue). When we assess the distribution of cases across neighbourhood
types, taking into account density of living, we find that caseload per capita, represented by
caseload per million population (Fig. 2b), and caseload per unit area (𝑘𝑚2 ) (Fig. 2c) are
systematically higher in neighbourhoods with slums than in non-slum neighbourhoods across
cities.

Figure 2. Distribution of Covid-19 cases across neighbourhoods with slums and other neighbourhoods.
Red columns: Neighbourhoods with slums. Blue columns: Non-slum neighbourhoods. a: Population
density of slum and non-slum neighbourhoods shows that slum neighbourhoods have higher densities, on
average, across all cities. b: Covid-19 cases per million population across slum and non-slum
neighbourhoods. Slum neighbourhoods are more affected in all cities, except Rio de Janeiro. c: Covid-19
cases per 𝑘𝑚2 across slum and non-slum neighbourhoods. In all cities, slum neighbourhoods show much
higher spatial density of cases than non-slum neighbourhoods.

The only exception here is Rio de Janeiro, where we find that neighbourhoods with slums have a
lower caseload per capita than non-slum neighbourhoods; this should however be seen in light of
the many concerns have been raised about testing and measurement of Covid-19 cases in Brazil’s
favelas [7, 8, 9].
Overall, this finding suggests that density of living in neighbourhoods is a critical mediator of the
dynamics of infectious spread in a city, and that the urban poor in slums are starkly worse off in
terms of epidemy outcomes. Given this empirical context, we attempt to model these differential
impacts by simulating the spread of a typical respiratory epidemic in a network representing a
city-system composed of slum and non-slum neighbourhoods, and test whether the observed
intra-city epidemic outcomes from Covid-19 are representative more generally of respiratory
epidemic spread in cities with slums.

3. Model definition and specifications:
We model a network of a city consisting of 𝑁 nodes, with each node representing an agent in the
city, and 𝐻 neighbourhoods amongst which agents are distributed. While we lack empirical data
on the structure of real networks of physical proximity in cities of the developing world, there is
a growing body of work indicating that highly connected nodes or ‘super-spreaders’ are

disproportionately important in the transmission of even influenza like illnesses [10, 11, 12].
Therefore, we propose to explore the dynamics of transmission on a scale-free Barabási-Albert
(BA) network [13]. The Barabási-Albert (BA) network with 𝑁 nodes is generated by attaching
new nodes with 𝑚 neighbours, such that the links of a new node show preferential attachment for
existing nodes with high degree. We also test the robustness of model outcomes for sensitivity to
network type in Appendix 3.
Our interest is in studying differential impacts across slum and non-slum neighbourhoods
described by a wide variation in population density, and we simulate such density differences as
differences in the average degree of nodes in each neighbourhood of the network. That is, we
model connectedness of a neighbourhood as the average degree of nodes in a neighbourhood.
We construct neighbourhoods in the network by ordering all 𝑁 agents based on node degree and
then allotting each of them in order to the 𝐻 neighbourhoods in the city system, such that the first
neighbourhood is filled with the first set of ordered 𝑁/𝐻 agents, followed by the second
neighbourhood and so on, until the final neighbourhood is filled with the last set of 𝑁/𝐻 agents.
Creating neighbourhoods in this way ensures that average degree of nodes across
neighbourhoods shows significant heterogeneity. It also means that nodes in neighbourhoods
with higher average degree are connected to many nodes both within and outside of their
neighbourhoods – this is meaningfully representative of the urban poor in cities of the
developing world, who live in densely populated slums and have high interconnectedness
(unavoidable physical proximity) within the slum, but work largely in other non-slum
neighbourhoods, including as essential services workers such as sanitation and health workers.
This algorithm also means that neighbourhoods with high average degree correspond only to
high-density slum neighbourhoods, and not high-density neighbourhoods in general – for
instance, neighbourhoods that well-off and where high densities are obtained by building
vertically are represented in our model as neighbourhoods with lower average node degree
(lower connectedness), which is a more likely representation of their daily contact networks. We
also vary the algorithm to populate neighbourhoods, while still ensuring reasonable
heterogeneity in average degree of neighbourhoods, and find that model outcomes are robust to
these changes (Appendix 3).

We use the three compartment Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model as the basis for an
agent’s progression through the duration of the epidemic [14]. Agents start out in the Susceptible
(𝑆) compartment until the time they are infected, at which point they fall into the Infected (𝐼)
compartment. After spending a specified duration of time being infected, when they spread the
infection in the network, they move to the Recovered (𝑅) compartment, at which time they are
immune - neither infective nor susceptible to the infection again. At 𝑡 = 0 days, we have one
random node that is infected (𝐼), while the remaining 𝑁 − 1 nodes are susceptible (𝑆).
At each time step 𝑡, the dynamics of infectious spread in the network are modelled as follows:
First, each infected (𝐼) agent spreads the disease to each of its susceptible (𝑆) neighbours in the
network with transmission probability 𝑝. Given a node 𝑖 with 𝑘 neighbours (or a contact rate of
𝑘), the average daily infections caused by this node, or its daily transmission rate (𝛽𝑖 ), is the
product of the transmission probability and the contact rate of the node, 𝛽𝑖 = 𝑝𝑘. Second, each
infected agent moves into the recovered (𝑅) compartment if it has spent 1/𝛾 days in the infected
(𝐼) compartment. 𝛾 is defined to be the recovery rate and remains constant through the dynamics.
We propagate these dynamics over a period of 𝑡 = 𝑇𝑓 days and study the distribution of cases
across the 𝐻 neighbourhoods over time, as well as the current and cumulative caseloads across
neighbourhoods over time. Table 3 provides the complete set of parameter values and initial
conditions for the simulations.

We also propagate model dynamics for a range of parameter values: population (𝑁),

mechanisms for populating neighbourhoods. The results are presented in Appendix 3.

4. Results:
The evolution of cumulative fraction of caseload across neighbourhoods clearly shows that the
rate of case growth increases with population density (Fig. 3a). This is in keeping with the
empirical finding that once epidemy dynamics are underway and the infection has reached higher
density neighbourhoods, caseload per capita is higher in high density neighbourhoods. For
instance, at day 10 of the dynamics, the densest neighbourhood in our network (with average
node degree, 𝑘 = 421) has a cumulative caseload of 4.7% (as a fraction of its population), while
the lowest density neighbourhood (with average node degree, 𝑘 = 50) is at 0.5%, and all other
neighbourhoods with densities in between these extremes show caseloads between 0.5% and
4.7% (Fig. 3a). The corresponding caseloads on days 20 and 30 are 66% and 96% for the densest

To explore these dynamics analytically, consider a neighbourhood with 𝑁ℎ nodes, each with
degree 𝑘. Given 𝑝 and 𝑘, at 𝑡 = 0, the average daily transmission rate is 𝛽 = 𝑝𝑘. At the end of a
time interval 𝑡, let 𝑓𝑆 (𝑡) be the fraction of population still susceptible and 𝑓𝐼 (𝑡) the fraction that
has ever been infected until 𝑡, such that 𝑓𝑆 (𝑡) = 1 − 𝑓𝐼 (𝑡). 𝑓𝐼 (𝑡) is given by (Eq. 1):

𝑎𝑡 𝑡 = 0

𝑓𝐼 (𝑡) = 𝑓𝐼 (𝑡 − 1) + (𝛽𝑓𝐼 (𝑡 − 1)(1 − 𝑓𝐼 (𝑡 − 1)),

)) (1 − 𝑓𝐼 (𝑡

− 1)), 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑡 ≥ 1/𝛾

The effective transmission rate of the epidemic in the neighbourhood, 𝑅𝑒 (𝑡), is the average
number of people infected by an individual in the neighbourhood at time 𝑡:
𝑅𝑒 (𝑡) =

𝑝𝑓𝑆 (𝑡−1)𝑘
𝛾

= 𝛽𝑓𝑆 (𝑡 − 1)/𝛾

(2)

Using this simple construct, we consider two neighbourhoods – a slum with average degree 𝑘1
and a non-slum with average degree 𝑘2 (𝑘2 < 𝑘1 ) - with probability of transmission 𝑝 and a
single node infected at 𝑡 = 0. The evolution of 𝑅𝑒 (𝑡) shows that the slum has a much higher
effective transmission rate in the early part of the dynamics due to higher 𝑘 (Fig. 3b). This results
in sharp increase in caseloads in this period, causing a simultaneous sharp decline in 𝑅𝑒 (𝑡) due
to the coevolution of susceptible and infected populations. The non-slum neighbourhood has a
lower effective transmission rate to begin with and shows a more gradual increase in cases. The
overall effect is that higher density results in higher caseloads per capita in the slum as against
the non-slum (Fig. 3b), which offers a possible explanation for the empirical observations from
developing world cities where case density increases with neighbourhood population density
(Figs. 2b and 2c).
We also study the distribution of cases across neighbourhoods and find that, just as observed
empirically, there is an unequal distribution of caseload across neighbourhoods during the
dynamics (Fig. 4a). However, as the epidemic runs its course, the inequality in distribution
progressively reduces – Fig. 4a plots the distribution of caseloads at different points in time and
we see that inequality in distribution of cases is greatest at 𝑡 = 10 when 𝑘𝑓 = 0.62, following
which there is continuous reduction in inequality until 𝑡 = 50 when 𝑘𝑓 = 0.51, at which point
the epidemic has ended. For the epidemic to end, it infects as much of the population as is
required for the effective transmission rate to summarily decline below 1; therefore, even as

dense slum neighbourhoods see their caseloads rise steeper and peak earlier (Fig. 4b), thus
yielding higher inequality in case distribution, lower density non-slums are not immune to the
epidemy and will see delayed but increasing caseloads resulting in declining inequality in the
distribution towards the end of the epidemic (Figs. 3a, 3b, and 4a). Our empirical findings from
Mumbai, Cape Town, and Lagos conform with this modelled outcome, though Rio de Janeiro,
Dhaka and Manila do not (Fig. 1).

across neighbourhoods over time. Distribution of cases is more unequal earlier in the epidemic and become
less unequal as epidemic progresses b: Simulation of current caseloads across neighbourhoods over time.
Higher density neighbourhoods show earlier and sharper peaks in active cases compared to lower density
neighbourhoods. Dashed black line: Line of equality (𝑦 = 𝑥).

Our model suggests that both in terms of cumulative caseload outcomes at the end of the epidemic
(Fig. 3a), as well as (higher and earlier) peak caseloads during the epidemic (Fig. 4b), slum
neighbourhoods are much worse off than non-slums in an epidemic. We find that the nature of
outcomes described here are robust to a wide range of change changes in model parameters such
as population of the city system (𝑁), probability of transmission (𝑝), and number of
neighbourhoods (𝐻), as well as changes in network structure and mechanism of populating
neighbourhoods (Appendix 3).
In summary, our modelled outcomes are in broad agreement with the empirical observations,
suggesting that the nature of these outcomes is more generally reflective of epidemic spread in
cities with slums.

5. Conclusion:
We study the evolution of the Covid-19 epidemic across neighbourhoods within a city, for a set
of metropolises in the developing world. We find an unequal distribution of cases, with a small
number of the most densely populated neighbourhoods containing a significant proportion of
total caseload across all cities, as illustrated by a 𝑘-index ~0.70 across these cities. This finding
appears to hold across scales, with national case distribution across these states/provinces also
displaying similar inequality in case distribution. We also find that neighbourhoods with the
highest case densities – both in terms of population and area - contain the largest slums in these
cities, and that consequently the urban poor in slums are at the highest risk in this epidemic.
Using a simple network model, we simulate the emergence of differential outcomes for slums
and non-slums in a city. Model outcomes replicate both unequal distribution of cases as well as
higher case densities in high-density neighbourhoods, suggesting that these outcomes are
reflective of outbreaks in general for cities with slums. In addition, simulations also predict that
as the epidemic progresses, distribution of cases across neighbourhoods becomes less unequal,
and that both peak caseloads and cumulative caseloads are worse for slum neighbourhoods vis-àvis non-slum neighbourhoods in cities.
Urban slums reflect increased demographic growth, migration, population densities, and poverty,
which are the main processes found to be linked with prevalence of infectious diseases [15].
There is evidence to suggest that slum populations scale super-linearly with city size [16],
meaning that larger cities have more than proportionally larger slums. It is anticipated that there
will be over 40 megacities in the world by 2030 and most will be located in the developing world
[17]. The evolution of larger slums and higher population densities will mean that slums will
continue to at the forefront of epidemics, both in terms of public health and socioeconomic
outcomes.
In the immediate or near term, health departments in developing countries must prepare specific
guidelines for physical distancing in high density settlements that are clearly communicated and
can be implemented by slum dwellers, so that their exposure risks are minimized [18]. However,
the long-term solution to this lies in ensuring that slum settlements, which often house a large
proportion of the urban population, are provided with functioning environmental infrastructure
for piped running water and private sanitation, waste management, and electricity, in addition to

basic health infrastructure such as primary healthcare facilities [19, 20, 21]. Creating cleaner,
more sanitary environments will make it possible to more systematically counter the easy spread
of infections.
