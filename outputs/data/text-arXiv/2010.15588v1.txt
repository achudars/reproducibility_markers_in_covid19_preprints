Taking into account their strategic roles in public health and researchers can use the data from this
study to identify the action scenario for decision-making in the combat of (SARS-CoV-2) COVID 19 in
Phase 3 and Phase 4 corresponding to the indigenous language speaking population in Mexico
The importance of data analysis is that it allows identifying cases (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 in Mexico
is concentrated daily and knowing the impact on the population and allows preparing action scenarios
to make public health policy decisions to combat SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 in the indigenous language
speaking population in Mexico

Data Description
The source of information on the number of registered cases of (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 at 1 August 2020 for
Mexico comes from the website https://datos.gob.mx/busca/dataset/informacion-referente-a-casos-covid19-en-mexico by the Ministry of Health, with the participation of the National Council for Science and
Technology (CONACYT), the Center for Research in Geospatial Information Sciences (CENTROGEO), the
National Laboratory for Geo-Intelligence (GEOINT), the Data Laboratory of the National Laboratory for
Geointelligence (DataLab), where the registry of COVID-19 cases (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 is concentrated, and
is the official means of communication and information on the epidemic in the Popoluca from the Soteapan
Area in Mexico.
The information of the cases (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 in Mexico is concentrated on a daily basis since April 19,
2020, communication and official information on the epidemic in Mexico, the data are presented at the
municipal, state and national levels, with a daily registry of patients, according to age, sex, comorbidities, for
the condition of (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 according to the following characteristics: a) Positive, b) Negatives,
c) Suspects. Likewise, it presents information regarding the identification of an outpatient and / or
hospitalized patient, attending to their medical development, identifying: a) Recovered, b) Deaths and c)
Assets. The data processing corresponds to the records on the epidemic (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 at 1 August
2020. The treatment of the information is carried out through the application software for data mining and
visual programming Orange Data Mining version 3.26.0. Orange Data Mining is a machine learning and data
mining suite for data analysis through Python scripting and visual programming. [1]
According to (WHO, 2020) the (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 disease pattern presents 4 scenarios identified from
the confirmation of Laboratory Diagnosis: a) Not Infected or b) Infected, in this finally, the following categories
are observed, taking into account age and specific comorbidities in each case: a) Mild Infection, b) Moderate
Infection, c) Severe Infection and d) Critical Infection.
Depending on the category observed in Patients who have a Confirmation of Infected, as in the case of a) or
b) it can assume the character of Outpatient, so the strategy is isolation or "quarantine" at home, where the
result It is hoped that he will recover. Regarding the Patients who have a Confirmation of Infected, in
categories c) and d) they assume the character of Hospitalized Patient, with a probability of requiring care in
Intensive Care Units and requiring Intubation, and where it is hoped to save as many patients as possible.

The importance of the research is that it allows identifying the action scenario for making public health policy
decisions to combat CO(SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19, since they consider the following states of process in medical
treatment, in order to carry out the Estimate of Scenarios for Medical Care of the (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19
under the following premises of hospital care:
1. A patient with a positive (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 laboratory diagnosis can be considered: a) Outpatient,
or b) Hospitalized.
2. If the (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 Positive patient is Hospitalized, the following should be considered: a)
Enter the Intensive Care Unit or b) Do not enter the Intensive Care Unit.
3. If the (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 Positive patient is Hospitalized and Entered into the Intensive Care Unit,
the following should be considered: a) The patient requires intubation or b) The patient does NOT require
intubation.

Methods
The information is presented in raw in CVS format, the Ministry of Health of Mexico. The data processing
corresponds to the records on the epidemic (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 at 1 August 2020. The treatment of the
information is carried out through the application software for data mining Orange version 3.26.0, in which
the algorithm for the analysis of information are developed and it is filtered to present the current scenario
in Mexico of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID 19). In this way, the algorithm that is presented allows us to project the
requirements for the use of installed infrastructure in the face of the growing requirement for patient care
Positive (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19, allowing the identification of scenarios at the national, state and municipal
levels. The construction of the algorithm is based on the following definitions.
Definition 1: Total Patients to consider in Model (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19.- It is the number of total patients
according to the confirmatory laboratory result or not of (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19).
Be:
TP SARS-CoV-2 i j = Total patients according to (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 confirmatory laboratory result

Definition 4: Positive Patients for (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 i j.- It is the number of patients with laboratory
results with positive confirmation for (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 i j .
It has:
P + SARS-CoV-2 i j = Patient with a positive (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 result in the State, Municipality
Definition 5.- Medical Treatment Strategy for a patient with positive laboratory confirmation for (SARS-CoV2) COVID-19 i j .- It is the Action Plan in Medical Treatment for a patient with positive laboratory confirmation
for SARS-CoV-2 in attention to your degree of infection and comorbidities present that is channeled to
determine the Physician.
According to the Strategy of Medical Care required for Patients with a Positive SARS-CoV-2 Result, according
to their degree of identified infection, they have the following.
Be:
ET P + SARS-CoV-2 i j = Medical Treatment Strategy P + SARS-CoV-2 i j
The medical treatment for a patient with a positive laboratory result for (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19, based on
the Medical Treatment Strategy (ETM P + SARS-CoV-2 ij), based on his degree of infection and present
comorbidities, poses two action scenarios : i) Outpatient (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 patient or ii) Hospitalized
(SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 patient.
Be:
i) Outpatient COVID19 patient.
P + SARS-CoV-2 i j Outpatient = Positive (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 with Outpatient mode in the State,
Municipality
ii) COVID19 Patient Hospitalized.
P + SARS-CoV-2 i j Hospitalized = Positive (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 with modality Hospitalized in the State,
Municipality
where:
Depending on the degree of infection (I1, I2 or I3), the Hospitalized (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 Patient may
require: i) Access to the Intensive Care Area without Intubation or ii) Access to the Intensive Care Area with
Intubation.
