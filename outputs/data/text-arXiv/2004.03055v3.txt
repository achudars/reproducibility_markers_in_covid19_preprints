We use aggregated data from Facebook to show that COVID-19 is more likely to spread
between regions with stronger social network connections. Areas with more social ties
to two early COVID-19 “hotspots” (Westchester County, NY, in the U.S. and Lodi
province in Italy) generally had more confirmed COVID-19 cases by the end of March.
These relationships hold after controlling for geographic distance to the hotspots as well
as the population density and demographics of the regions. As the pandemic progressed
in the U.S., a county’s social proximity to recent COVID-19 cases and deaths predicts
future outbreaks over and above physical proximity and demographics. In part due to
its broad coverage, social connectedness data provides additional predictive power to
measures based on smartphone location or online search data. These results suggest
that data from online social networks can be useful to epidemiologists and others hoping
to forecast the spread of communicable diseases such as COVID-19.

To forecast the geographic spread of communicable diseases such as COVID-19, it is valuable to know which individuals are likely to physically interact (Piontti et al., 2018). In
particular, since social ties shape patterns of physical interaction, observing the strength
of social connections between cities and regions can be useful for determining a locality’s
risk of future disease outbreaks. Yet, the geographic structure of social networks is usually
difficult to measure on a national or global scale. In this paper, we overcome this challenge
by using aggregated data from Facebook to measure social connections between regions. We
then show that these connectedness measures can help forcecast the geographic spread of
communicable diseases such as COVID-19.

We construct a measure of the social connectedness between U.S. counties and between
Italian provinces. This Social Connectedness Index captures the probability that Facebook
users in a pair of these regions are Facebook friends with each other (Bailey et al., 2018b).
We hypothesize that regions connected through many friendship links are likely to have
more physical interactions between their residents, providing opportunities for the spread
of communicable diseases. Indeed, our measure has been shown to be predictive of travel
patterns across Europe (Bailey et al., 2020d) and within urban areas (Bailey et al., 2020a),
suggesting it contains important information about real-world interactions. Most directly,
Coven et al. (2020) use our Social Connectedness Index to show that counties with higher
levels of social connectedness to New York City were more likely to be destinations for those
fleeing the city during the pandemic, providing direct evidence for our propopsed mechanism.
After introducing our Social Connectedness Index, we show that regions with stronger
social ties to early COVID-19 “hotspots” — Westchester County, NY, in the U.S., and Lodi
province in Italy — had more documented COVID-19 cases per resident as of March 30,
2020. These relationships are robust to controlling for the geographic distance to these
early hotspots, as well as demographic characteristics of the regions. Social connectedness
to Westchester has more predictive power for forecasting county-level COVID-19 cases than
social connectedness to any other county outside the New York-Newark CSA. These case
studies provide initial evidence that social connectedness might serve as a valuable predictive
measure in addition to physical distance and other inputs to current epidemiological models.
We then exploit the changing geography of the pandemic in the U.S. to conduct a
more systematic in-sample analysis. We construct regional measures of COVID-19 exposure
through social connections (“social proximity to cases”) and physical distance (“physical
proximity to cases”). We find that changes in a county’s social proximity to cases in one
time period are strongly correlated with the county’s subsequent growth in own local cases.
Even after controlling for physical proximity to cases and other regional demographics, a
doubling in social proximity to cases in one two-week period corresponds to a 24.9% increase
in own cases in the next two-week period. These results are unlikely to be explained by differential testing between regions, as an increase in social proximity to deaths in one period
also corresponds to an increase in actual deaths in the next period.
To mimic a real-world epidemiological use case, we also conduct a simple out-of-sample
prediction exercise. We find that models that include our measure of social proximity to
cases are better able to predict a region’s future case growth than alternative models that
rely only on geographic distance and other demographics. We also compare the predictive
value of social proximity to cases to measures from Google searches related to COVID19 symptoms and the smartphone-based Location Exposure Index (LEX) introduced by

Couture et al. (2020). In counties with both LEX and Google search data, social proximity
to cases provides only small additional predictive value — perhaps not surprisingly, given
that the real-world movement of people captured by the LEX is precisely the mechanism we
conjecture explains the predictive power of social proximity to cases. However, when using
the best available model to make predictions for all U.S. counties (for many of which no LEX
data or Google search information is available), models that include social proximity to cases
sizably improve accuracy. This highlights one important advantage of social connectedness
data: its broad coverage and global availability.
Our use of the Social Connectedness Index to forecast COVID-19 spread adds to an active
body of research that studies how aspects of social media and internet-usage patterns can
be used for tracking and preventing disease (for an overview, see Aiello et al., 2020). One
strand of this literature uses the content of individuals’ internet searches or social media
posts; most famously, Google Flu Trends used search queries related to influenza for early
outbreak detection (Ginsberg et al., 2009). Other researchers have also used content from
Twitter posts (Rodrı́guez-Martı́nez and Garzón-Alfonso, 2018; Jahanbin and Rahmanian,
2020), Facebook likes (Gittelman et al., 2015), Wikipedia searches (Generous et al., 2014),
and Instagram posts (Correia et al., 2016) to predict public health outcomes. A second
strand of research, which has received much attention during the COVID-19 pandemic,
uses geolocation data to track individuals’ movement patterns. These data have been used
to explore the determinants and effects of social distancing behavior (for an overview, see
Giuliano and Rasul, 2020), as well as forecast disease spread (e.g., Jia et al., 2020; Bengtsson
et al., 2015; Wesolowski et al., 2012, 2015; Peixoto et al., 2020). A third strand of that work
uses crowdsourced information, including surveys, to monitor disease symptoms and detect
outbreaks (see Facebook Symptom Survey; Smolinski et al., 2015; Paolotti et al., 2014).
In comparison to this literature, our stable network-based measure is less likely to suffer
from changes in internet behavior or seasonality, both of which have hampered Google Flu
Trends (Olson et al., 2013). In addition, our measures do not require individuals to have
experienced symptoms, which potentially allows us to identify at-risk localities before disease
transmission.1 Finally, because our measures are based only on aggregated connections
(instead of individual movement), they are easily accessible to researchers and consistently
available for a large number of granular geographies around the world. For example, the
Social Connectedness Index is available at the NUTS3 level in Europe, the GADM2 level in
the Indian Subcontinent and Canada, and the GADM1 level throughout much of the rest
1

However, this suggests that our data might partner well with these measures. For example, if one can
detect an early outbreak using surveys, they could then predict (and potentially prevent) the next outbreak
using information on social connectedness.

of the world.2 The index not only measures connections within countries, but also between
countries, which may be otherwise challenging with mobility data from different cellphone
providers (and important for tracking the international spread of communicable diseases).
More generally, our results add to a literature that has applied aspects of network theory
to build spatial epidemiological models (for overviews, see Keeling and Eames, 2005; Keeling
and Rohani, 2011; Danon et al., 2011). Works in this literature move beyond the basic assumption that individuals within a population are “fully mixed,” or equally likely to interact;
instead, they better represent the dynamics of real-world connections (e.g., Newman, 2002;
Klovdahl, 1985; Klovdahl et al., 1994; Mossong et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2020). While some
of these studies parameterize models with information on local networks, we are unaware of
any that introduce a measure with comparably high levels of coverage and granularity. Our
hope is that our unique measure of social connectedness can help parameterize future epidemiological work. In addition, we hope that the Social Connectedness Index can advance
the literature on the determinants and effects of urban and regional social networks (see
Bailey et al., 2020a; Kim et al., 2017; Büchel and Ehrlich, 2020; Mossay and Picard, 2011;
Brueckner and Largey, 2008; Glaeser et al., 1992).
It is important to note that our objective in this paper is not to incorporate social
connectedness into a state-of-the-art epidemiological model. Instead, we provide a unique
measure to assess regions’ outbreak risk, answering the call of Avery et al. (2020), among
others, who highlight an “urgent need” for “creative and entrepreneurial methods” of interpreting and sharing data to model coronavirus spread. To that end, the data used
in this paper, as well as similar data for a number of other geographies, are available at
https://data.humdata.org/dataset/social-connectedness-index. We encourage interested researchers to use them.

Data Description

To measure the intensity of social connectedness between locations, we use a de-identified
and aggregated snapshot of all active Facebook users and their friendship networks from
March 2020.3 As of the end of 2019, Facebook had nearly 2.5 billion monthly active users
around the world: 248 million in the U.S. and Canada, 394 million in Europe, 1.04 billion in
Asia-Pacific, and 817 million in the rest of the world (Facebook, 2020). The data therefore
2

Interested researchers may also access U.S. ZCTA-level data by emailing sci data@fb.com.
We use the data from March 2020, since this this allows our analyses to correspond most closely to a
real-time forecasting exercise. The publicly available Social Connectedness Index data is based on a snapshot
from August 2020. Since the SCI is extremely stable over time, results do not change across the various data
sets.

has extremely wide coverage, and provides a unique opportunity to map the geographic
structure of social networks around the world. Locations are assigned to users based on their
information and activity on Facebook, including their public profile information, and device
and connection information. Establishing a connection on Facebook requires the consent
of both individuals, and there is an upper limit of 5,000 on the number of connections a
person can have. As a result, Facebook connections are generally more likely to be between
real-world acquaintances than links on many other social networking platforms.
Our measure of the social connectedness between two locations i and j is the Social
Connectedness Index (SCI) introduced by Bailey et al. (2018b):
Social Connectednessi,j =

F B Connectionsi,j
.
F B U sersi ∗ F B U sersj

(1)

Here, F B Connectionsi,j is the total number of Facebook friendship links between Facebook
users living in location i and Facebook users living in location j. F B U sersi and F B U sersj
are the number of active users in each location. Social Connectednessi,j thus measures the
relative probability of a Facebook friendship link between a given Facebook user in location
i and a given Facebook user in location j: if this measure is twice as large, a given Facebook
user in region i is twice as likely to be friends with a given Facebook user in region j.
In previous work, we have shown that this measure predicts a large number of important
economic and social interactions. For example, social connectedness as measured through
Facebook friendship links is strongly related to patterns of sub-national and international
trade (Bailey et al., 2020b), patent citations (Bailey et al., 2018b), and investment decisions
(Kuchler et al., 2020).4 More generally, we have found that information on individuals’
Facebook friendship links can help understand their product adoption decisions and their
housing and mortgage choices (Bailey et al., 2018a, 2019a,b).
Data on COVID-19 cases in the U.S. by county come from Johns Hopkins University
Center for Systems Science and Engineering. Data on COVID-19 cases for each Italian
province come from the Italian Dipartimeno della Protezione Civile. Because differential
testing across regions may introduce bias in case-based results, we will also use information
on COVID-19 related deaths from each source in Section 3.

A growing body of research also uses this measure to study issues related to COVID-19. For example,
Bailey et al. (2020c) use the SCI, along with individual-level data from Facebook, to show that social
network exposure to COVID-19 cases shapes individuals’ social distancing behaviors. Holtz et al. (2020)
use SCI data to document spillover effects in state-level COVID-19 health policies. Charoenwong et al.
(2020) and Makridis and Wang (2020) work with the SCI to study other behavioral effects of exposure to
COVID-19 through friends.

Early Hotspot Analysis

In this section, we explore how the domestic spread of confirmed COVID-19 cases is related
to the social connectedness to two early COVID-19 “hotspots”: Westchester County, NY,
in the U.S., and Lodi Province in Italy. Westchester County includes New Rochelle, a
community that had the first major confirmed COVID-19 outbreak in the eastern United
States (Chappell, 2020). By March 20th, the county had over 9,300 cases, second only to
nearby New York City. Additionally, a number of articles reported that wealthy residents
from Westchester and the New York area had fled to other parts of the U.S. (Tully and Stowe,
2020), providing a vector that could potentially spread the disease. Indeed, geneticists and
epidemiologists later found that travel from New York seeded much of the first wave of U.S.
COVID-19 outbreaks (Carey and Glanz, 2020). Social connections to Westchester may thus
provide particularly important information for tracking early COVID-19 spread, especially
given that Coven et al. (2020) find that social connectedness to New York City predicted
travel patterns from the city early in the pandemic. Lodi is an Italian province of around
230,000 inhabitants in the heavily impacted region of Lombardy. It contains Codogno,
where the earliest cases of COVID-19 in Italy were detected, and was at the center of Italy’s
outbreak (Horowitz et al., 2020).
Panel (a) of Figure 1 shows a heatmap of the social connectedness of Westchester County,
NY, to other U.S. counties; darker colors correspond to stronger social ties. Panel (b) shows
the distribution of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 residents across U.S. counties on March 30,
2020, with darker colors corresponding to higher COVID-19 prevalence. These maps show
a number of similarities. Perhaps most notably, coastal regions and urban centers appear
to have both high levels of connectedness to Westchester and larger numbers of COVID-19
cases per resident. But a number of more subtle patterns also emerge. Both measures are
high in the communities along the Florida coast (in particular along the southeastern coast,
near Miami), in western and central Colorado (in particular in areas with ski resorts), and
in the upper Northeast. These areas are all popular vacation destinations and second home
locations for many well-heeled residents of Westchester. Indeed, the governors of Florida and
Rhode Island publicly lamented the number of New York area residents fleeing to their states
and spreading COVID-19 (Mower, 2020; Carlisle, 2020). By contrast, many areas that are
geographically closer but less socially connected to Westchester, such as counties in western
Pennsylvania and West Virginia, had fewer confirmed COVID-19 cases on March 30. There
are also a number of patterns of COVID-19 prevalence that connectedness to Westchester
alone cannot explain. Areas around King County, WA (Seattle), for example, have relatively
low connectedness to Westchester, but were an independent early hotspot of COVID-19.

Note: Panel (a) shows the social connectedness to Westchester for U.S. counties. Panel (b) shows the
number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 10,000 residents by U.S. county on March 30, 2020. Panels (c)
and (d) show binscatter plots with counties more than 50 miles from Westchester as the unit of observation.
To generate the plot in Panel (c), we group log(SCI) into 100 equal-sized bins and plot the average against
the corresponding average case density. Panel (d) is constructed in a similar manner. However, we first
regress log(SCI) and cases per 10,000 residents on a set of control variables and plot the residualized values
on each axis. Red lines show quadratic fit regressions. The controls for Panel (d) are 100 dummies for the
percentile of the county’s geographic distance to Westchester; population density; median household income;
and dummies for the six National Center for Health Statistics Urban-Rural county classifications.

The two bottom panels of Figure 1 explore the relationship between COVID-19 prevalence and social ties to Westchester more formally. Panel (c) shows a binscatter plot of
social connectedness to Westchester County and the number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000
residents. We exclude those counties within 50 miles of Westchester County: while those
areas have strong social links to Westchester, they are also close enough geographically such
that their populations might interact physically with Westchester residents even in the absence of social links (e.g., in supermarkets and houses of worship). There is a strong positive
relationship between social ties to Westchester and COVID-19 prevalence. Quantitatively,
a doubling of a county’s social connectedness to Westchester is associated with an increase
of about 0.88 COVID-19 cases per 10,000 residents. The R-squared of this relationship is
0.093, suggesting that, in a statistical sense, 9.3% of the cross-county variation in COVID-19
cases can be explained by counties’ social connectedness to Westchester.
One concern with interpreting these initial correlations is that they might be primarily
picking up other factors that affect the spread of COVID-19, and that are correlated with
social connectedness to Westchester. Specifically, even after dropping counties within 50
miles of Westchester, the correlations might be primarily picking up geographic distance to
Westchester (which is related to the number of friendship links to Westchester). As a result,
including social connectedness might not improve predictive power for models that already
control for some of these other variables. In Panel (d), we therefore present a binscatter
plot of the relationship between social connectedness to Westchester County and COVID19 cases that controls for a number of these possible confounding variables (in addition
to excluding nearby counties). Most importantly, we non-parametrically control for the
geographic distance between each county and Westchester County by including 100 dummies
for percentiles of that distance. We also control for median income, population density, and a
classification of how urban/rural a county is. Even conditional on these other factors, Panel
(d) shows a strong positive relationship between COVID-19 cases as of March 30, 2020 and
social connectedness to Westchester County. With these controls, a doubling of a county’s
social connectedness to Westchester is associated with an increase of about 0.80 COVID-19
cases per 10,000 residents. The total R-squared of the statistical relationship is 0.190, while
the incremental R-squared from controlling for social connectedness to Westchester is 0.037.
Another potential concern stems from the fact that the underlying social network and
the site of the initial hotspot are nonrandom. This may confound our interpretation if,
for example, counties with ties to Westchester were also destinations for European travelers seeding the virus in the United States. To contextualize the effect of connections to
Westchester in particular, we next run “placebo” regressions, identical to the one shown for
Westchester in panel (d) of Figure 1, for every U.S. county with a population over 50,000.

Figure 2: Incremental R2 from Adding Connections to Individual U.S. Counties
(a) Excluding Counties within 50 Miles

(b) Excluding Counties within 150 Miles

Note: Panels show results from regressions to predict COVID-19 cases per 10k people by county on March
30, 2020. The incremental R2 is the increase in R2 from adding log(SCI) and log(SCI)2 to a particular
U.S. county, over and above a set of baseline control variables: 100 dummies for percentiles of distance
to the county under investigation; population density; median household income; and dummies for the six
National Center of Health Statistics Urban-Rural county classifications. The graphs show the distributions
over the incremental R2 s for adding social connectedness to each county with a population over 50,000 in
turn. Each regression in panels (a) and (b) excludes counties within 50 and 150 miles of the county of
interest, respectively. In each panel the 10 largest incremental R2 are labeled.

Figure 2 shows the incremental R-squared from adding social connectedness in each of these
regressions. Panel (a) excludes counties within 50 miles of the chosen county, as in Figure
1. Westchester’s 0.037 incremental R-squared is second only to New York City, and each
top 10 county is in the New York-Newark Combined Statistical Area (CSA).5 That connections to each of these counties matters so strongly suggests that, although Westchester
contained the earliest discovered COVID-19 outbreak in the eastern U.S., community spread
may have already been present in many neighboring counties. Panel (b) shows results for
regressions excluding counties within 150 miles of the chosen county. Doing so will exclude
New York City and Westchester cases from every regression for a New York-Newark CSA
county.6 Counties within the CSA remain as 9 of the top 10, including the top 3: New
York City, Fairfield, and Westchester.7 These findings highlight that social connections to
other counties that may have similar demographics to Westchester, but that did not have
an early COVID-19 outbreak, do not help with forecasting COVID-19 spread. In turn, this

Although New York City contains multiple counties, early NYC COVID-19 data was not disaggregated.
As such, we combine the counties in this section. NYC is disaggregated in all analyses in Section 3.

The maximum distance from any county in the CSA to New York City and Westchester is 91 miles and
104 miles, respectively.

Anecdotally, Williamson and Hussey (2020) linked Fairfield to COVID-19 spread early in the pandemic.

suggests our previous results are not due to omitted variables whereby counties with links
to Westchester are more susceptible to COVID-19 outbreaks for some other reason.
It is important to highlight that the purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate the predictive power of social connectedness measured via online social networks for COVID-19
prevalence. The control variables highlight that the Social Connectedness Index has such
predictive power over and above a number of variables on which data is already easily available, and that may partially proxy for social connections in models of communicable disease
spread. We will benchmark this predictive power against other measures, such as smartphone
location pings and Google searches for COVID-19 symptoms, in Section 3.
Figure 3 explores the analogous relationships for Lodi province in Italy.8 The provinces
with highest COVID-19 case densities and connectedness to Lodi are in the surrounding Lombardy region, as well as the nearby Piemonte and Veneto regions. There are also relatively
high levels of both connectedness to Lodi and COVID-19 cases in Rimini, a popular tourist
destination along the Adriatic sea. A number of provinces in southern Italy send workers
and students to the industrial Lombardy region, and therefore have strong social ties to that
region. While some of these areas have seen a number of COVID-19 cases, they are not
disproportionally larger, perhaps reflecting the efforts of Italian authorities to restrict the
movement of individuals (Kington, 2020). Panels (c) and (d) repeat the binscatter exercises
from Figure 1 (there are fewer data points in Figure 3 than there are in Figure 1, since there
are fewer Italian provinces than U.S. counties). We exclude provinces within 50 kilometers
of Lodi. In Panel (d) we control for geographic distance using 20 dummies for quantiles of
distance from each province to Lodi, as well as GDP per inhabitant and population density.
As before, we find that the Social Connectedness Index appears to have predictive power
above these other measures that might commonly be used to proxy for social interactions.
Quantitatively, the estimates from Panel (d) suggest that a doubling of the SCI corresponds
to an increase of 16.6 COVID-19 cases per 10,000 residents. The incremental R-squared of
including social connectedness to Lodi over the other control variables is 0.057.9
Taken together these case studies illustrate the potential usefulness of our measure of
8

Because Italian provinces on the island of Sardinia do not align with European NUTS3 regions (the
level at which we measure social connectedness), we include Sardinia as a single observation in our analysis.
9
In Appendix A, we conduct an additional exercise to mimic a potential real-world use case in which
U.S. public health officials might have seeked to predict disease spread from the initial Westchester outbreak.
Since, by March 10, there was not yet enough documented domestic COVID-19 spread to parameterize a
forcecasting model based on U.S. data, these officials might have looked to Italy to understand how social
connections to early hotspots translate into subsequent case growth. To replicate such an analysis, we train
a model using Italian provinces and their conntectedness to Lodi to predict Italian COVID-19 cases as of
March 10. We then use that model to forecast U.S. COVID-19 cases as of March 30 based on counties’ social
connectedness to Westchester as the initial hotspot. We find that including social connectedness as a model
input in this exercise improves out-of-sample predictions of COVID-19 cases across U.S. counties.

series of case growth from March through November, as well as additional predictive measures
from smartphone locations and Google searches, to explore this potential in more detail.

Time Series Analysis

In this section, we exploit the changing geography of the pandemic in the U.S. to more
systematically investigate the predictive value of the Social Connectedness Index for forecasting the spread of COVID-19. We construct two primary time-varying metrics: “Social
Proximity to Cases”, a county-level measure of exposure to COVID-19 cases through social
networks, and “Physical Proximity to Cases”, a county-level measure of exposure through
physical proximity. While the two measures will be related (because individuals generally
have stronger social ties to those who are geographically nearby, as documented in Bailey
et al., 2018b), the examples in the previous section illustrate that some geographically distant places — such as Westchester and the east coast of Florida — can have strong social
ties. To benchmark the predictive power of social connectedness, we also construct measures
using data from smartphone locations and Google symptom searches.
Key Variable Construction. We construct our measure of social proximity to cases as:
Social P roximity to Casesi,t =

X
j

Social Connectednessi,j
. (2)
Cases P er 10kj,t ∗ P
h Social Connectednessi,h

Cases P er 10kj,t is the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 10,000 residents in county
j as of time t. The sums j and h are over all counties. Analogously, we construct a measure
of a county’s physical proximity to cases as:
P hysical P roximity to Casesi,t =

X
j

Cases P er 10kj,t ∗

1
.
1 + Distancei,j

(3)

Here, Distancei,j is the physical distance between counties i and j measured in miles. We
create a further related exposure measure using smartphone location data. Specifically,
Couture et al. (2020) create a Location Exposure Index (LEX) that measures, among smartphones that pinged in a given county i today, the share that pinged in each county j at least
once during the previous 14 days. We use these matricies to construct:
LEX P roximity to Casesi,t =

X
j

LEXi,j,t
Cases P er 10kj,t ∗ P
.
h LEXi,h,t

(4)

We also use data from Google LLC on searches related to COVID-19 symptoms. The
data include a county by week normalized (within county) probability that a user will make
a symptom-related search. For each county and two-week period, we define the change in
searches related to a symptom as the percent change in this probability between the second
week of the period and the second week of the previous period. We use searches related to
fever, cough, and fatigue. We provide additional details in Appendix D. Finally, to explore
whether it is the specific bilateral patterns of connectedness or a county’s overall level of
connectedness that is most relevant for predicting the spread of COVID-19, we include
controls for the share of a county’s Facebook connections that are within 50 and 150 miles.10
Empirical Specification. We first study the relationship between observed case growth
and “lagged” (i.e., in past time periods) growth in our measures. We hypothesize that if
social connectedness is an important predictor of the path of COVID-19 spread, a lagged
measure of social proximity to new cases will have a positive relationship with new case
counts in the next period. For each county i and time period t, our baseline specification is:
log(∆ Cases per 10k + 1)i,t = β1 ∗ log(∆Cases per 10k + 1)i,t−1
+ β2 ∗ log(∆Cases per 10k + 1)i,t−2
+ β3 ∗ log(∆Social P roximity to Cases)i,t−1
+ β4 ∗ log(∆Social P roximity to Cases)i,t−2
+ β5 ∗ Share F riends within 50mii
+ β6 ∗ Share F riends within 150mii
+ β7 ∗ log(∆P hysical P roximity to Cases)i,t−1
+ β8 ∗ log(∆P hysical P roximity to Cases)i,t−2
+ Xi,t + i,t

(5)

Here, t is defined as one of the eight two-week time periods between March 30 and November 2, 2020. For each time period t, prior two-week periods are denoted t − 2 and t − 1
(for example, March 3 - 16 and March 16 - 30 for the first period starting March 30).
We always include two lags of own case growth, and explore the effects of lagged changes
of social and physical proximity to cases. In some specifications we will add controls for
log(∆LEX P roximity to Cases + 1)i,t , lagged by one and two time periods, and for the
percent change in Google searches related to fever, cough, and fatigue for this period or
10

With the underlying assumption that Facebook usage rates (as a share of the true population)
are roughly equal across counties, we construct these controlsPusing the Social Connectedness Index as
Share W ithin K M Ii = [SCIi,j ∗ P opj ∗ 1(Distancei,j < K)]/[ h SCIi,h ∗ P oph ], for county i.

lagged by one period. Xi,t are a set of time-specific fixed effects, including percentiles of
population density and median household income. In our strictest specification, we also add
time × state fixed effects. To rule out differential testing across regions driving our results,
we also conduct a similar exercise replacing COVID-19 cases with COVID-19-related deaths.
For these analyses, we use four-week time periods, beginning with April 28 - May 25, with
our exposure measures lagged by four and eight weeks.
Regression Analysis. Panel A of Table 1 shows that past growth in social proximity
to COVID-19 cases in one period has a strong positive relationship with actual growth in
cases in the subsequent period. In columns 1 and 2, we document this relationship without
controlling for physical distance to cases (column 2 adds state × time fixed effects to the
specification in column 1, to control for time-varying state-level differences in public health
measures). In contrast, columns 3 and 4 show that there is no systematic relationship
between the share of a county’s friends that are within 50 and 150 miles and COVID19 cases. This suggests that it is the specific bilateral patterns of social connections that
correlate with disease spread, not simply that counties with more “open” networks experience
worse outbreaks in every period. Columns 5 and 6 show that physical proximity to cases
is also strongly correlated with subsequent case growth, a relationship which may confound
the one in columns 1 and 2. To address this, columns 7 and 8 include both the physical
proximity and social proximity measures. While the coefficient on social proximity to cases
declines somewhat — suggesting some of the relationship is due to physical proximity —
the relationship remains highly statistically and economically significant. In our strictest
specification, which includes state × period fixed effects, a doubling of social proximity to
cases in one period corresponds to a 24.9% increase in cases per capita in the next period.
Panel B of Table 1 presents the same specifications, using COVID-19 deaths (instead of
COVID-19 cases) as the dependent variable. The relationships are very similar, suggesting
that our results are not driven by differential testing across counties that might have been
correlated with social proximity to cases.
In Appendix B we conduct two additional regression exercises. First, we run regression
5 separately for each time period, allowing us to study how the relationship between social
connections and new COVID-19 cases changes over the course of the pandemic. Table A2
shows that, in every two-week period from March 30 to November 2, a one-period lagged
measure of social proximity to cases was a statistically significant predictor of actual case
growth. In Table A3, we add additional measures from smartphone locations and symptom
searches to our regression framework. We find that changes in Google symptom searches
— both in the current period and in the previous period — and lagged LEX proximity to

Note: Table shows results from regression 5. In Panel A, each observation is a county × two-week period
(between March 30 and November 2, 2020). The dependent variable is log of one plus the number of new
COVID-19 cases per 10,000 residents. In Panel B, each observation is a county × four-week period (between
April 28 and November 2, 2020). The dependent variable is log of one plus the number of new COVID-19
deaths per 10,000 residents. Columns 1 and 2 include log of growth in social proximity to cases (deaths)
lagged by one and two periods (two and four weeks in Panel A, four and eight weeks in Panel B). Columns
5 and 6 include analogous measures of physical proximity to cases (deaths). Columns 3 and 4 also control
for the share of a county’s Facebook connections that are within 50 and 150 miles. Columns 7 and 8 include
all measures. All columns include controls for one and two period lagged changes in cases (deaths), as
well as time-specific fixed effects for percentiles of county population density and median household income.
Columns 2, 4, 6, and 8 include additional time × state fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the
time × state level. Significance levels: *(p<0.10), **(p<0.05), ***(p<0.01).

cases are strongly correlated with present case growth. However, even in the presence of
each of these other predictors, changes in the social proximity to cases remains a significant
predictor of subsequent case growth in sample. We next benchmark the predictive power of
social connectedness to these measures using an out-of-sample prediction exercise.
Out-of-Sample Prediction Analysis. Building on our previous results, we next conduct
a simple out-of-sample prediction exercise. During a pandemic, local policymakers might
want to determine their localities’ risks for an outbreak in real time to inform public health
measures. With this case in mind, we build a series of simple models that use available data
at time t to predict case growth in counties at time t + 1. We test the added predictive
value of social proximity to cases by building separate models that include and exclude this
measure, as well as other possible predictors. Because we do not use the “test” data to
train the models, a reduction in prediction error would be reflective of a true improvement
in real-world predictions of COVID-19 cases that could have been achieved from using social
connectedness data (as opposed to the increase in in-sample R2 in our previous analyses).
Table 2 shows the results of this prediction exercise. The results in all columns are
generated using a random forest, an ensemble prediction algorithm commonly used in data
science applications. The algorithm allows us to find non-linear relationships between variables, without overfitting, by aggregating mean predictions from a number of regression trees
generated over sample subsets of both observations and input variables.11 In most settings,
random forest out-of-sample predictions outperform those of linear models.
Columns 1-3 describe the prediction error from a simple model that includes the measures
from columns 7 and 8 in Panel A of Table 1.12 Column 1 excludes the two lagged measures of
social proximity to cases and column 2 includes them. Columns 1 and 2 show the root mean
squared error (RMSE) from a model trained using data from all periods before the period of
interest, then tested on that next period; each prediction period is shown as a separate row.
The RMSE for both models generally decreases as the training sample gets larger, ending at
0.667 and 0.652 log new cases per 10,000 residents. Column 3 shows the difference in RMSE
between the two models, with negative numbers indicating an improvement in out-of-sample
fit from including social proximity to cases. In every row, the RMSE is lower when including
social proximity to cases, suggesting it does significantly improve predictions.
In columns 4-9 we add information on Google symptom searches and mobility based
on smartphone locations. Doing so allows us to benchmark the predictive value of social
11

In our analysis we use 500 trees. For more information on random forests, see Breiman (2001).
Here, we use non-binned measures of population density and median household income. Because random
forests are able to identify non-linear relationships between input and outcome measures, we no longer need
to split the measures into percentiles to allow for non-linear relationships.

Note: Table shows results from county-level predictions of COVID-19 case growth. The predicted outcome
is log of one plus the number of new COVID-19 cases per 10,000 residents. All columns show root mean
squared errors (RMSEs) from a random forest model trained on data from all periods prior to the period of
interest. The model inputs in column 1 are population density; median household income; and log of growth
in physical proximity to cases and actual cases, lagged by two and four weeks (one and two time periods).
Columns 4 and 7 include information on one and two period lagged measures of LEX proximity to cases, and
one period lagged percent changes in Google searches related to fever, cough, and fatigue. Column 4 includes
predictions for 3,136 counties using, for each county, a model that utilizes the most available information
possible. Column 7 limits to the 1,976 counties for which we have both Google symptom search and LEX
data. Columns 2, 5, and 8 add lagged measures of social proximity to cases to columns 1, 4, and 7. Columns
3, 6, and 9 show the change in RMSE from adding social proximity to cases.

proximity to cases over and above these other predictors. Columns 4-6 include predictions
for all counties included in the COVID-19 case data. We make a prediction for each county
using the “best” model (in terms of model features) based on data availability. For example,
for a county with LEX and Google data, we will predict cases using a model trained with LEX
and Google data. For a county with only LEX data, we will predict using a model trained
without Google data, and so on.13 Column 6 shows that, once again, RMSE decreases in
every period after including social proximity to cases, highlighting its incremental predictive
value over and above other measures one might have used.
In columns 7-9 we limit to the 1,976 counties which have both LEX and Google symptom
search data. Column 9 shows that in 10 of 14 periods, predictions using social connectedness
do outperform the comparison model. However, the differences are generally small, suggesting that when limiting to only counties with LEX and Google data, social proximity to cases
may provide only a small degree of additional predictive value. This is perhaps unsurprising:
our proposed mechanism by which social connectedness helps forecast COVID-19 spread is
through predicting in-person interactions, which are more directly measured in LEX data.14
Tthe fact that social connectedness consistently improves predictions in the full set of U.S.
counties (columns 4-6) highlights an important availability advantage of the data. While the
LEX and Google data are limited to counties with a sufficient number of devices or searches
in a period, the relatively stable nature of social connectedness over time (combined with
Facebook’s large user base) allows the SCI to be available in more counties, and potentially
also at finer levels, such as zip codes.15 Furthermore, Facebook’s global reach allows for SCI
measures within and between most parts of the world. We are unaware of smartphone location
data that can similarly measure, for example, connections between GADM1 regions in Africa,
NUTS3 regions in Europe, and U.S. counties — and information on these connections may
aid in forecasting the global spread of communicable diseases.
13
This requires training four models: (1) baseline; (2) baseline + LEX; (3) baseline + Google; and (4)
baseline + LEX + Google. We train each model on every county that has the necessary non-missing data.
For example, a county with LEX and Google data will be used to train all four models.
14
In Appendix C we repeat this exercise using COVID-19 related deaths. We find similar results. Baseline
models that include social proximity to deaths have smaller prediction errors than models that exclude the
measure. Social proximity to deaths does not appear to add sizable predictive value to LEX and Google
measures when limiting to counties with both sets of data; however, when using the “best available” model
in any county, social proximity to deaths does sizably improve predictions.
15
The SCI data used for this paper include 3,141 counties, the Google data include 2,572 counties, and
the LEX data include 2,018 counties.

Conclusion

In the context of threats from communicable diseases such as COVID-19, a region’s ability
to determine optimal public health responses depends on its ability to forecast the risk of
an outbreak (Reich et al., 2019). A primary determinant of this risk is the likelihood of
physical interactions between the region’s residents and residents of other areas with severe
outbreaks. Information on the geography of social connections, which shape patterns of
physical interactions, are therefore crucially important for public health officials. In this
paper, we use de-identified and aggregated data from Facebook to measure social connections
between regions, and find those connections to be an important predictor of outbreaks during
the COVID-19 pandemic. We show that areas that are more connected to early pandemic
hotspots in the U.S. and Italy had, on average, higher case counts by March 30, 2020,
even after controlling for physical distance and other demographics. Furthermore, due to
its broad geographic coverage, social connectedness data improves out-of-sample predictions
of COVID-19 spread during the U.S. pandemic beyond smartphone location and Google
symptom search data.
The methodologies we use should not be interpreted as an attempt to create a stateof-the-art epidemiological model. However, our results strongly suggest that our measure
of social connectedness may prove useful in future epidemiological work. In particular, its
high-degree of availability — in terms of both geographic coverage and granularity — allow
social connectedness to provide predictive power over and above other available measures.

Out-of-Sample Hotspot Analysis

In this section, we conduct a simple prediction exercise to test the value of social connectedness in forecasting how a disease will propagate from a hotspot early in a pandemic. To do
so, we train a model using an Italian hotspot and test it using a subsequent U.S. hotspot.
On March 10, 2020, New York state created a “containment area” around New Rochelle,
a community in Westchester County that had the first major COVID-19 outbreak in the
eastern United States. At this time, U.S. local officials around the country were likely
worried about the extent of their own regions’ exposures to COVID-19. Yet, in the absence
of existing data on domestic COVID-19 spread in the U.S., it may have been difficult to
calibrate a local forecasting model. One potential solution would have been to train a model
using information from the Italian outbreak — which by mid-March had been spreading for
some time — to predict COVID-19 spread in the U.S.
We mimic this use case by first training linear regression and random forest models using
data from Italy. Specifically, for each Italian province, we predict the number COVID19 cases per 10,000 people on March 10 using population density, a measure of income,
and distance and social connectedness to the Lodi hotspot. We exclude provinces within
80 km (50 miles) of Lodi. We train versions of these models with and without including
social connectedness to Lodi as a predictor. In each model, we normalize every measure by
subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This normalization, which is
common in machine learning prediction applications, ensures that our predictive measures
are scaled similarly in the U.S. and Italian settings. In our prediction exercise we use, for
each U.S. county, the Italy-trained models to predict the number of COVID-19 cases per
10,000 people on March 30 (i.e., 20 days in the future) with and without data on social
connectedness to Westchester.
Table A1 shows that our predictions improve when adding social connectedness to the
hotspots as a model input. Row (1) shows that the RMSE drops from 0.99 to 0.97 (in
standard deviations from the mean cases per 10,000 residents) for the linear regression model
and from 1.04 to 1.01 for the random forest model. Row (2) compares the rank of counties’
predictions with the true rank. For both models the rank-rank correlations increase when
including social connectedness to the hotspot as a predictor.

Note: Table shows results from county-level predictions of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 residents. Columns
1-3 and 4-6 show results from linear regression and random forest models, respectively. The models are
trained using information from Italy on March 10 and tested using information from the U.S. on March 30.
All measures are normalized by subtracting the mean then dividing by the standard deviation. Row (1) shows
the prediction root mean squared errors (RMSEs) and row (2) shows prediction rank-rank correlation with
the truth. The model inputs in columns 1 and 4 are log(distance) to the hotspot (Lodi in Italy, Westchester
in the U.S.), population density, and household income / (GDP per inhabitant). Columns 2 and 5 add
log(SCI) to the hotspots. Columns 3 and 6 show the change in each measure from adding log(SCI).

B

Additional Time Series Regressions

Table A2 shows the results from running the regression in Table 1’s column 8 separately
for every two-week period betwen March 30 and November 2. In every period, a two week
lagged measure of social proximity to cases was a statistically significant predictor of actual
case growth. The magnitudes of the coefficients suggest a doubling in social proximity to
cases in one two-week period corresponds to between a 10.9% and 66.4% increase in actual
cases in the next period, after controlling for physical proximity to cases and other controls.
Table A3 shows the results from adding additional predictive measures to Table 1.
Columns 1 and 2 are the same as columns 7 and 8 in Table 1. Columns 3 and 4 show
that a “nowcast” of changes in Google symptom search trends is strongly correlated with
changes in case growth. Columns 5 and 6 show that this relationship persists, though somewhat less strongly, for a one-period lagged measure of changes in symptom searches. The
latter measure, unlike the former, could be used to predict future case growth. Columns
7 and 8 show that the change in LEX proximity to cases in one period also has a strong
positive relationship with actual case growth in the next. Even in the presence of each of
these other measures, social proximity to cases remains a significant predictor of future case
growth.

Note: Table shows results from regression 5. Each observation is a county × two-week period (between
March 30 and November 2, 2020). The dependent variable is log of one plus the number of new COVID-19
cases per 10,000 residents. Columns 1 and 2 are the same as columns 7 and 8 in Table 1. Columns 3 and
4 add the percent growth in Google searches related to fever, cough, and fatigue from the week prior to
the period to the second week of the period. Columns 5 and 6 includes analogous measures lagged by one
period. Columns 7 and 8 add LEX-based proximity to cases. Standard errors are clustered at the time ×
state level. Significance levels: *(p<0.10), **(p<0.05), ***(p<0.01).

Out-Of-Sample Prediction: COVID-19 Deaths

Table A4 show the prediction error from a simple out-of-sample forecasting exercise analogous
to that in Table 2, but for COVID-19 deaths instead of COVID-19 cases. Columns 1-3 use

the variables in columns 7 and 8 of Table 1, Panel B as predictors. The model presented in
column 2 includes the two lagged measures of social proximity to COVID-19 deaths, while
the model presented in column 1 does not include them. The RMSE is lower in every period
in the model that includes social proximity to deaths as a predictor. Columns 4-6 include
predictions for all counties included in the COVID-19 case data. We make a prediction using
the “best” model available (in terms of number of model features), as described in Section
3. Column 6 shows that the RMSE decreases again in every period when including social
proximity to deaths as a predictor. Columns 7-9 limit to counties with Google and LEX
data. Similar to our findings for county-level COVID-19 cases, social connectedness does
not appear to provide substantial additional predictive value in this particular setting.

Note: Table shows results from county-level predictions of COVID-19 deaths. The predicted outcome is
log of one plus the number of new COVID-19 deaths per 10,000 residents. All columns show root mean
squared errors (RMSEs) from a random forest model trained on data from all periods prior to the period
of interest. The model inputs in column 1 are population density; median household income; and log of
growth in physical proximity to deaths and actual deaths, lagged by four and eight weeks (one and two time
periods). Columns 4 and 7 include information on one and two period lagged measures of LEX proximity
to deaths, and one period lagged percent changes in Google searches related to fever, cough, and fatigue.
Column 4 includes predictions for 3,156 counties using, for each county, a model that utilizes the most
available information possible. Column 7 limits to 1,976 counties for which we have both Google symptom
search and LEX data. Columns 2, 5, and 8 add lagged measures of social proximity to deaths to columns 1,
4, and 7. Columns 3, 6, and 9 show the change in RMSE from adding social proximity to deaths.

Additional Details on Google Symptom Search Data

In Section 3, Appendix B, and Appendix C we use data on Google searches related to
COVID-19 symptoms from Google LLC. The data include a county by week normalized
(within county) probability a user will make a symptom-related search. These measures
come in a daily series and a weekly series. If a given symptom in a given county does not
meet certain Google quality or privacy thresholds at the daily level, it will be provided at

the weekly level. If it cannot meet these thresholds at the weekly level, it is not provided.
If a county/symptom is provided for a period at the daily level, it is not also provided at
the weekly level. To create a time series at the county/weekly level, we therefore average
non-missing daily measures by week. We use searches related to three common COVID-19
symptoms: fever, cough, and fatigue.
To aggregate our measure to the bi-weekly periods used in Section 3, Appendix B, and
Appendix C we define the change in searches related to a symptom as the percent change in
the probability between the second week of the period and the second week of the previous
period. For example, for the period March 31 - April 13, the percent change is from March
23 - March 29 to April 6 - 12. In our prediction exercise presented in Table 2, we use a
one-period lagged version of this measure. Some counties are missing data for particular
weeks. So that our final sample has a complete time series for every included county, we
exclude counties with missing data in more than half the periods in our sample and impute
zero change in any remaining missing periods. 97 percent of counties included are missing
fewer than 1 in 4 periods and 77 percent are missing fewer than 1 in 20 periods.
