Article’s Lead
This paper studies conspiracy and debunking narratives about COVID-19 origination on a major Chinese
social media platform, Weibo, from January to April 2020. Popular conspiracies about COVID-19 on
Weibo, including that the virus is human-synthesized or a bioweapon, differ substantially from those in
the US. They attribute more responsibility to the US than to China, especially following Sino-US
confrontations. Compared to conspiracy posts, debunking posts are associated with lower user
participation but higher mobilization. Debunking narratives can be more engaging when they come from
women and influencers and cite scientists. Our findings suggest that conspiracy narratives can carry
highly cultural and political orientations. Correction efforts should consider political motives and identify
important stakeholders to reconstruct international dialogues toward intercultural understanding.

●

Content. What conspiracy narratives on the origination of COVID-19 are prevalent on Chinese
social media over different outbreak phases? How are they similar or different from conspiracy
narratives popular in the US? According to these conspiracies, which countries/entities are to
blame for the origination of the COVID-19 pandemic?

engaging users?

ESSAY SUMMARY
●

●

●
●

We use the largest to date COVID-19 Weibo corpus to understand the prevalent conspiracy and
counteractive narratives regarding COVID-19 origination, over different phases during the
pandemic, from January 1 to April 30, 2020.
Popular conspiracies about COVID-19 on Weibo differ substantially from those in the US.
Conspiracies about COVID-19 as human-synthesized or a bioweapon are prevalent on Weibo,
especially following Sino-US confrontations.
Most conspiracy posts on Weibo faulted the US for COVID-19 origination, whereas most
debunking posts sought to absolve China from responsibility.
Debunking conspiracies can be more engaging when they come from women and influencers
and cite scientific sources.

Argument & Implications
COVID-19 has garnered a massive amount of conspiracy narratives on social media since January 2020.
Conspiracy refers to “an effort to explain some event or practice by reference to the machinations of
powerful people, who attempt to conceal their role” (Sunstein & Vermeule, 2009, p.205). In the COVID19 context, conspiracy centers around virus origination (i.e., who created and spread it). Such misbelief
can erode institutional trust, dampen international relations, generate xenophobia, or decrease
preventive health behaviors (Swire-Thompson & Lazer, 2020). Conspiracy narratives have been
examined in the US (Pew, 2020a, 2020b) and in Europe (Georgiou et al., 2020). For example, prominent
narratives promote conspiracy ideation that the US government created the virus, the virus is a Chinese
bioweapon (Jamieson & Albarracin, 2020), 5G spreads COVID-19 (Ahmed et al., 2020), or Bill Gates was
behind the virus for vaccination programs (Georgiou et al., 2020). So far, no study has examined the
evolution of conspiracy narratives in China. Understanding variations of conspiracy narratives across
different sociopolitical contexts is imperative in correcting such misinformation and is pivotal in building
effective transnational cooperation to mitigate the pandemic.
This study focuses on the Chinese social media context, which, against a backdrop of escalating Sino-US
conflicts, has fostered various COVID-19 conspiracies that present a different picture from that of the US
and the globe. We examined social media posts that propagate and debunk COVID-19 conspiracies. This
paper defines conspiracy posts as those that spread conspiracies about the origination of COVID-19. This
paper defines debunking posts to broadly include any posts that disapprove, disagree and refute such
conspiracies, either with or without providing evidence (see Appendix G for examples of conspiracy
posts and debunking posts). The debunking posts are classified by their content and not restricted to
any particular type of user or source. Overall, this study has three important real-world implications.
The first implication suggests political parties, media, and public agencies to avoid purposefully or
inadvertently propagating conspiracy narratives, as they not only misdirect the public's attention during
a public health crisis but can also breed long term harm such as declining trust towards governments
and authorities (Freeman et al., 2020). As our findings suggest, conspiracy narratives were a direct
response to the deteriorating Sino-US relationship, and in turn, debilitated the relationship even further,
creating a precarious downward spiral. Conspiracies either covertly or overtly endorsed by the two
countries’ political figures have exacerbated the problem and devastated international collaborations
for global pandemic responses.
Further, pandemic and conspiracy narratives carry highly contextualized cultural and political
assumptions and nuances (Ding & Zhang, 2010; Jovančević & Milićević, 2020). As we show, prominent
conspiracies about COVID-19 origination center on either human synthesization or biological weapons
on Weibo. By contrast, popular conspiracies concerning 5G, Dr. Fauci, and Bill Gates in the US and
elsewhere are seldom mentioned on Weibo. Underlying different conspiratorial arguments are different
cultural and political orientations toward technologies and the governments. For example, the Chinese
nationalism portraying the US as the political and economic threat is a warrant fueling the bioweapon
conspiracy. Correcting such conspiracies thus requires further addressing constructed nationalism. A

2

practical implication is that efforts on mitigating conspiracy narratives need to work on increasing
intercultural and international dialogues to identify common interests and values, and to dispel
unfounded claims and misunderstandings. In this regard, we suggest government agencies, media, and
educators to work on developing more constructive and unbiased narratives of the pandemic and its
global responses.
The second implication informs governmental policy on fighting against the susceptibility to conspiracy
beliefs. Just as most conspiracy posts on Weibo faulted the US for COVID-19 origination, most debunking
posts sought to absolve China from responsibility. The finding suggests that people may selectively
endorse and share debunking messages that support their own group, resulting in an ideologically
narrow flow of debunking messages to their followers (Shin & Thorson, 2017). Against the backdrop of
increasing Sino-US tension, it is challenging to engage the public when debunking certain conspiracy
narratives consistent with one’s political or national identity. Communication strategies thus need to
facilitate dissolving echo chambers around certain conspiracy narratives that politicize health issues (Del
Vicario et al., 2016). For example, inoculation could be an effective strategy to reduce the public’s
susceptibility to conspiracy beliefs (Roozenbeek & van der Linden, 2019). By giving small doses of
conspiracy narratives and explicitly warning the public about how specific political motives (e.g.,
partisanship, international conflict) fuel each conspiracy narrative, we could help the public become
more sophisticated at processing various information on social media.
A final implication of this study concerns platform design about creating effective debunking strategies
to counteract conspiracy posts. We showed that users were less engaged (i.e., retweet, like, comment)
in debunking posts than conspiracy posts, which echoes previous work that false information diffuses
significantly faster, farther, and more broadly than true information on social media (Vosoughi, Roy, &
Aral, 2018). Fighting conspiracy is a difficult battle, but our study highlighted that influencers and
verified organizational users with a larger following could help draw more user participation to
debunking posts. Influencers and organizational users can be considered as critical seeds for
disseminating debunking information through online social networks (Rubin, 2017). Social media
platforms and public agencies may consider actively enlisting their help in the debunking process.
In sum, we propose the following practical recommendations:
● Political parties, media, and public agencies should avoid citing nationalistic and politically
motivated conspiracy narratives and make an effort to dispel conspiracy thinking through
increased international dialogues.
● Public communication efforts can consider employing inoculation and media literacy education
to decrease susceptibility to conspiratorial thinking.
● Social media platforms need to encourage trusted influencers, organizations, and scientists to
disseminate debunking information.

Findings
Finding 1: Popular conspiracies about the origination of COVID-19 on Chinese social media differ
remarkably from those in the US. Conspiracies about COVID-19 as human-synthesized and bioweapon
are prevalent on Weibo and these posts attribute more responsibility to the US than to China.
Figure 1 shows the number of posts that attribute responsibility to the US, China and other entities for
each origination type, and responsibility attribution comparing conspiracy posts vs debunking posts. We
found that conspiracy origination types that dominate the Chinese social media differ from those in the
US and around the globe. In the US or around the globe, conspiracy about 5G, Dr. Fauci, and Bill Gates
are prevalent (Pew, 2020a; Goodman & Carmichael, 2020). These conspiracies, however, constitute a
small proportion of conspiracies on Weibo (4.95%). Prevalent conspiracies on Weibo focus on whether
COVID-19 is deliberately made by country actors in labs or as bioweapons.
Comparing responsibility attribution between debunking posts versus conspiracy posts, we found that
people are more likely to debunk conspiracies that blame China while propagating conspiracies that
blame the US more frequently (χ2= 564.29, p<0.01). Responsibility attribution to US and China also
substantially differ between conspiracies that talk about the natural/unknown origin of COVID-19 versus
those that talk about the deliberative formation of COVID-19. For conspiracy posts that believe that the
origin of COVID-19 is natural/unknown, responsibility is attributed more frequently to China (31.07%)
compared to origination types that believe COVID-19 is deliberately synthesized by human (15.36%) and
used as bioweapons (4.20%).

Figure 1. Number of Conspiracy and Debunking Posts of COVID-19 Origination, by Origination Type and
Responsibility Attribution
Finding 2: Conspiracies that blame the US as the culprit of COVID-19 surged following Sino-US conflicts.
Conspiracy and debunking narratives as well as responsibility attribution evolved over time with an
interesting pattern. Conspiracy posts surged when the US announced sanctioning policies on China such
as President Trump tweeted about the China Virus, imposed green card ban, and proposed the 5G
cleaning plan on Huawei. While conspiracy posts surged during Sino-US conflicting times, debunking
posts surged when China's cases surged around mid-February due to changes in diagnosis testing and
when Trump said he would stop using the term China Virus on March 24th, 2020 (Top Panel). This
pattern of how Weibo posts evolve with Sino-US conflicts also persists in terms of responsibility
attribution of COVID-19. We found that posts that attribute responsibility to the US for creating COVID19 virus surged during Sino-US conflicting times (Bottom Panel).
These findings on how conspiracies and responsibility attribution evolved with Sino-US conflicts
underscore pandemic as a catalyzer for geopolitical conflicts, nationalism, and misinformation. Our
findings echo with the recent literature that stressed that nationalism might harm the equal distribution
5

of COVID-19 vaccines between the Global North and the Global South (Rutschman, 2020). As scholars in
psychology explained, the mechanism of “identity-protective cognition” might facilitate the spread of
science misperception (Kahan, 2017), as demonstrated by our empirical evidence that conspiracy
theories and blaming went hand in hand with Sino-US conflicts. Moreover, the pandemic is reshaping
the power structures and international systems between China and U.S., intensifying the Sino-US
competition and rivalry (Basu, 2020; Fiona et al., 2020). Escalated narratives focusing on the politics of
blaming have grown between China and the U.S. from political speeches to media coverage (Jaworsky
and Qiaona, 2020). Science communication has become politicized (Hart, Chinn & Soroka, 2020) and
ideological (Wolfe, 2018). As science communication intertwines with political communication
(Scheufele, 2014), it is vital to develop mutual understanding and meaningful dialogues between world
powers to share responsibility for coping with pandemics and fighting against misinformation.

Figure 2. Evolution of Conspiracy and Debunking Narratives, and Responsibility Attribution
Finding 3: Men are more likely to propagate and debunk conspiracy posts than women; Influencers and
organizational users are overrepresented in the debunking posts than they are in the overall Weibo
population.

6

We found that the users who propagate conspiracy and who debunk conspiracy are similar in profile.
Ordinary users, men, and users with followers between 100-1000 constitute the majority who post
conspiracy as well as debunking posts. However, compared with the user profile of the overall Weibo
population, a few notable trends emerge.
Among the users propagating conspiracy posts, organizational users are overrepresented (5.19%) than
they are in the overall Weibo population (1.46%), while influencers are slightly underrepresented
(7.96%) than they are in the overall Weibo population (8.59%). Among the users debunking conspiracy
posts, organizational users are again overrepresented (8.51%) than they are in the overall Weibo
population, while influencers are overrepresented (10.48%) than they are in the overall Weibo
population (8.59%). Men are disproportionately more likely than women to post conspiracy (χ2=108.52,
p<0.01) and debunking posts (χ2 =52.57, p<0.01), compared to the gender composition in the overall
Weibo population.

Figure 3. Conspiracy propagation and debunking behaviors by user type1

Finding 4: Debunking posts have less user engagement than conspiracy posts; However, debunking can
be more engaging when it comes from women, influencers and cites scientists.
In the baseline models with only user attributes and post type (conspiracy vs debunking posts), we
found that, compared to conspiracy posts, debunking posts are associated with 10.06% (p=0.07)
decrease in user participation (i.e., retweets, likes, comments), but 11.96% percent (p<0.01) increase in
user mobilization (i.e., number of @ and hashtags to mobilize others). Although debunking posts are
associated with lower participation, we found that the association is moderated by several factors.
Within debunking posts, those posted by men received 36.87% less participation than those posted by
women [Panel A, right bars], while the same engagement gap for conspiracy posts between men and
women was 13.93% [Panel A, left bars]. Within debunking posts, a 10 percent increase in the number of
1

Note: The data of “the number of followers” for the general Weibo population is not available.
7

followers is associated with 4.08 percent increase in participation [Panel B, blue line], while for
conspiracy posts, a 10 percent increase in the number of followers is associated with 3.05 percent
increase in participation [Panel B, red line]. For debunking posts, citing scientists as sources is associated
with a higher level of mobilization (20.93%, p=0.02) than those without citing sources [Panel C, right
bars]. However, for conspiracy posts, citing scientists is associated with 3.92 percent lower mobilization
than those without sources [Panel C, left bars].

Figure 4. How User Gender (A), Number of Followers (B) and Source Cited (C) Moderate the Associations
between Debunking Posts and User Participation and Mobilization2
Our finding that debunking posts by women received more participation than those posted by men
responds to a growing body of literature that examines gender differences in public engagement with
social media content. For instance, Jia et al. (2018) showed that female online video uploaders were
more popular than most male uploaders. The gender differences in how debunking messages were
engaged might be due to the language differences women and men use in persuasion (Falk and Mills,
1996). Taking a close reading of the post content by women users that received many reposts, we found
that these women used storytelling such as sharing about how COVID-19 has influenced their lives as
oversea students. They also used more soft and tentative languages to discuss the COVID-19 origination
such as asking for people’s mutual understanding about COVID-19 issues, suggesting people to not eat
wild animals rather than using hard propaganda languages to attribute responsibility with assertion,
which could backfire on audience acceptance about the message senders (Huang, 2018). Through
revealing the nuance of these moderators (such as gender), our study provides fruitful future research
directions such as investigating how debunking strategies could be matched with specific senders to
increase public engagement with science.

A 95% confidence interval for the marginal effect of the interaction terms on our dependent variables from the
OLS regression are plotted. We took the log form for our dependent variables “participation” and “mobilization”
accounting for their skewed distributions. We took the log form for our independent variable the number of
followers. For panel B, when log (Number of followers)=0, the intercept of participation for conspiracy posts is 0.53 and the intercept of participation for debunking posts is -0.65. For details on the full regression results, please

Methods
We performed content analyses and regression analyses to examine conspiracy narratives and user
engagement. COVID-19 related social media posts were retrieved from Weibo (the Chinese Twitter),
with 560 million monthly active users at the end of 2019 (Sina Weibo, 2020). However, Weibo does not
provide application programming interface (API) access to the independent researchers, and limits
keyword search output to 50 pages (around 1000 posts). To bypass these limitations, we utilized a large
Weibo user pool with 250 million users (with bots filtered out) (Shen et al., 2020; Hu, Huang, Chen &
Mao, 2020), which accounts for 48.1% of all monthly active Weibo users in 2019 (Sina Weibo, 2020).
This user pool was originally built in 2018 and started from a 5 million active Weibo users list collected in
our previous studies unrelated to COVID-19 (Li, Cho, Qin & Chen, 2020; Zhang, Nekmat & Chen, 2020),
along with a snowball sampling process3.

Using a snowball sampling method, we then retrieved the initial 5 million users’ followers and followees (second
degree users), the followers and followees of the second-degree users (third degree users) and so on until no new
users appear. This snowball process resulted in a pool of 250 million users (with bots filtered out) (Shen et al.,
2020).
10

Figure 5. Weibo data collection and content analysis procedure
From the user pool, we retrieved COVID-19 related posts using a comprehensive list of 179 keywords
(for a complete list, see Hu, Huang, Chen & Mao, 2020). After removing duplicates, we obtained a main
corpus of 40,893,953 COVID-19 related Weibo posts between December 1, 2019 (the date of the first
known COVID-19 case) and April 30, 2020. Drawing from academic, government and news resources4,
we found 35 COVID-19 conspiracy theories (e.g., “5G spreads virus”, “China utilizes COVID-19 to paralyze
the Western economy”). We summarized keyword combinations for each specific conspiracy narrative
(see Appendix A) via close observation of their relevant posts on Weibo, along with several rounds of
back-and-forth discussions. These keyword combinations were adopted to filter the COVID-19 corpus,
yielding 153,472 posts from Jan 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020. We removed duplicate posts and reposts as

We drew from 1) earlier research on COVID-19 conspiracies (Leng et al., 2020; Imhoff & Lamberty, 2020), 2)
Chinese fact-checking websites (e.g., Tencent Jiaozhen), 3) news website (e.g., BBC), and 4) government websites
(e.g., Embassy of People’s Republic of China in Germany).

practiced by other studies (Shen et al., 2020; González-Ibánez et al., 2011), because (1) we focus on the
narrative of the person who initiated the conspiracy and (2) we study the number of retweets of a post
as a dependent variable. The final dataset contained 6,735 unique original Weibo posts (original posts
are posts that start threads, not reposts or comments) about COVID-19 conspiracies dated from Jan 1,
2020 to April 30, 2020. These 6735 original posts reached a large audience, generating 31,421 reposts,
260,355 likes, and 38,075 comments.
We developed a comprehensive coding scheme to manually annotate each post based on four
dimensions: post types, origination types, responsibility attribution, and sources cited (See Appendix B
for coding scheme). Post types focus on distinguishing posts that propagate conspiracies vs
disapprove/refute conspiracies. Origination types concern the various theories on the origination of
COVID-19 such as whether the source of COVID-19 is unknown or made by human actors. Responsibility
attribution concerns the country or entities who are pointed out in a post as responsible for causing the
COVID-19 pandemic. Sources cited concerns the type of sources cited in a post such as from
government, scientists, media and so on. Six Chinese native speakers were trained and coded the posts
independently and satisfied inter-coder reliabilities were achieved (see Appendix C).
To examine the relationship between post type, origination types, responsibility attribution, and sources
cited, we first calculated the frequency of each category (See Appendix C). To examine the association
between post type and user engagement, two regression models were conducted. In the models, our
two dependent variables are post participation including like number, repost number and comment
number and post mobilization including number of @ and hashtags in a post. In our baseline model, our
independent variables include post type (conspiracy or debunking), user gender, user type, geolocation
(Hubei or outside Hubei), emotional factors (i.e., emotion score, emotion polarity, and emotion types)
were calculated based on previous practices (Zhang et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2016), and length of a post
(See Appendix D). In the full model, we added hand-coded variables such as origination types,
responsibility attribution, source cited in addition to baseline variables. To examine what debunking
strategies might be associated with variation in user engagement, our full model also included the
interaction of debunking and source cited, debunking and origination types, debunking and user
attributes (See Appendix E).
We discussed the limitations of our study in Appendix H about whether censorship could influence our
findings, disclaimer on causality, and generalizability of our findings to other media systems.

B. Coding scheme with definitions and operationalizations
The table below introduced the definition and attributes for our four content analysis variables: post
types, origination types, responsibility attribution, and sources cited. Post types include: 1) conspiracy
posts, 2) debunking posts that correct conspiracy narratives, and 3) irrelevant to conspiracies or
debunking: others posts which contain conspiracy keywords but are not specifically about COVID-19
origination (e.g. conspiracy or debunking posts about local government corruption). Origination types
concern the various theories on the origination of COVID-19, including: (1) COVID-19 came from nature
or some unknown origin (nature/unknown origin); (2) COVID-19 was entirely developed by humans
(human synthesis), (3) COVID-19 was the result of modifying the genes of one or more natural organisms
(lab-edited), (4) COVID-19 was developed as a biological weapon (bioweapon), (5) COVID-19 is caused by
5G (5G), (6) Smoking e-cigarettes caused COVID-19 (e-cigarette), (7) Genetically modified crops caused
COVID-19 (GMO), and (8) Others. Responsibility attribution concerns the country or entities who are
responsible for causing the COVID-19 pandemic as pointed out in a post, including: (1) China, (2) The
United States, (3) Japan, (4) Serbia, (5) other European countries, (6) Bill Gates, (7) other countries (outside
of the above-mentioned countries), and (8) no clear responsibility attribution. Sources cited include: (1)
government sources (documents, officials, organizations) (2) scientific scholars, (3) celebrities, (4)
ordinary people, (5) foreign media, (6) Chinese media, (7) industry/companies, (8) non-governmental
organizations, (9) others (outside of the above categories), and (10) no sources. For origination type,
responsibility attribution and sources cited, coders were allowed to select multiple categories
simultaneously.

C. Descriptive table for each hand-coded conspiracy related variables
The coding scheme was iteratively developed and pilot-tested with 100 randomly sampled Weibo posts
from the final dataset. Six Chinese native speakers were trained and coded the posts independently.
Intercoder-reliability was satisfactory, with Krippendorff's alpha for post type, origination types,
responsibility attribution, and source cited at 0.834, 0.786, 0.804, 0.826, respectively. The table below
provides the descriptive results of coding of each variable.

D. Regression table output for the baseline model described in Finding 4
Associations of Debunking to User Participation and Mobilization - Baseline Model

21

Note: we transformed our two dependent variables into the log format before we ran this model. For variable Hubei,
we coded it 1 if the province field a user filled in is Hubei Province, and 0 otherwise. Conspiracy posts are the
reference group for the variable “Debunking posts”.

E. Regression table output for Figure 4
Associations of Debunking to User Participation and Mobilization - Full Model

22

Note: we transformed our two dependent variables into the log format before we ran this model. For Other
conspiracy types, we merged 5G and GMO into this category. For China responsibility only, we coded it 1 if a post
assigned responsibility to China but not to any other entities, and 0 otherwise. For US responsibility only, we coded
it 1 if a post assigned responsibility to US but not to any other entities, and 0 otherwise. For variable Scientists and
Non-scientist sources, both came from a factor variable that has three levels: the reference level is no source is

23

cited in a post, the second level is a post cited scientists/scholars, and the third level is a post cited other nonscientist sources.

F. Distribution of Individual Narratives
We examined the individual narratives of each conspiracy related post by looking into the distribution of the
combination of our two main hand-labelled variables: origination type and responsibility attribution since these
two elements constitute the main part of a post’s content. From the table below, we can see that individual
narratives mainly consist of responsibility attribution to US and China when discussing the origination of COVID-19.
There is not much variation in individual narratives.

G. Examples of conspiracy posts and debunking posts
The table below provides examples (in Chinese and in English translation) for conspiracy posts and
debunking posts. In this paper, we define conspiracy posts as those that spread conspiracies about the
origination of COVID-19. We define debunking posts to broadly include any posts that disapprove,
disagree and refute such conspiracies, either with or without providing evidence. The first example of
debunking post refutes conspiracy with evidence by stating that people from other countries also got
COVID-19. The second and the third example under debunking posts refute conspiracy without using
evidence. As we can see that the post authors denounced the conspiracy by saying it is totally nonsense.
We did not fact check to verify whether the evidence used in these debunking posts are true.
We also provide the Weibo screenshots of conspiracy posts and debunking posts (in Chinese and in English)
after the table.

right? ? ? ! ! ! ! Is it possible that they imported
infected cases into China, thus affecting the rise of
Wuhan? @Zhong Nanshan @Lu Jian @Chinese

3. “The new coronavirus is a dehumanizing
laboratory mischief, which is definitely not caused
by wild animals, but a typical laboratory human
intervention. The wicked enemy, trying to kill us, is
notorious about the rise of China, and is frantically
studying the novel coronavirus against the Chinese.
After comparison, the enemy's conspiracy is rather
obvious. Coronavirus and SARS virus are very
similar in form and structure. In fact, they are the
same. They are all interventions, expansions, and
mutations based on SARS as the virus matrix. It is
not difficult to find that SARS and coronavirus are
both bad creations from the same laboratory, and
they are dehumanizing and humble experiments!
The Chinese people must keep their eyes open,
recognize the true nature of imperialism, reveal the
enemy's conspiracy and tricks, and wage a tit-fortat struggle against the frenzied enemy.”

H. Limitation of this Study

This study has several limitations. First, Weibo posts were collected retrospectively on May 16, 2020 and
thus our dataset does not contain deleted or censored posts. However, this potential exclusion should
29

not interfere with our conclusions as a previous study found that only 0.17% of all Weibo posts on
COVID-19 were censored, and these censored posts were generally about the government’s missteps in
COVID-19 response, not about COVID-19 origination (Fu & Zhu, 2020). Second, our study is exploratory
in nature. Findings on associations between debunking strategies and user engagement and patterns of
conspiracy and responsibility attribution evolution with Sino-US conflicts should not be interpreted as
causal. Finally, as our findings demonstrate, conspiracies prevalent on Chinese social media might differ
significantly from those of other countries or other media systems. It will be fruitful for future research
to examine major conspiracy theories emerged during COVID-19 in other countries to compare how
conspiracy narratives might differ among various media systems. It will also be interesting to examine
responsibility attribution by US users on Twitter. In fact, some research has shown that over 78%
American blamed China for its role in spreading COVID-19 (Pew, 2020b).
