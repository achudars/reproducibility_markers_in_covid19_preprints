Abstract
The explosion of disinformation related to
the COVID-19 pandemic has overloaded factcheckers and media worldwide. To help tackle
this, we developed computational methods
to support COVID-19 disinformation debunking and social impacts research. This paper presents: 1) the currently largest available
manually annotated COVID-19 disinformation category dataset; and 2) a classificationaware neural topic model (CANTM) that combines classification and topic modelling under a variational autoencoder framework. We
demonstrate that CANTM efficiently improves
classification performance with low resources,
and is scalable. In addition, the classificationaware topics help researchers and end-users to
better understand the classification results.

Introduction

COVID-19 is not just a global disease pandemic,
but has also led to an ‘infodemic’1 (WHO, 2020)
and a ‘disinfodemic’2 (Posetti and Bontcheva,
2020). The increased volume (Brennen et al., 2020)
of COVID-19 related disinformation has already
caused public mistrust (Clare and Christie, 2020)
and even real-life damage to health and 5G masts.3
Consequently fact-checkers and media worldwide are having to triage carefully their limited resources in order to uncover and debunk quickly and
effectively the most damaging kinds of COVID-19
disinformation. For example, Brennen et al. (2020)
found that most disinformation in the early stage of
the pandemic made false claims related to actions
and statements by public authorities.

Guided by these needs, we developed an automatic COVID-19 disinformation classifier and
made this available for testing and use by professionals at AFP and First Draft. 4
The challenges of this task are that: 1) there is
no sufficiently large existing dataset annotated with
COVID-19 disinformation categories, which can
be used to train and test machine learning models.
2) Due to the time-consuming nature of manual
fact-checking and disinformation categorisation,
manual corpus annotation is expensive and slow to
create. Therefore the classifier should robustly handle training with low resources. 3) COVID-19 disinformation classification is a fast-moving research
area, thus the model should provide suggestions
to researchers about relevant categories. 4) The
classifier and decisions should be self-explanatory,
enabling journalists to understand the rationale for
the auto-assigned category.
To address the first challenge, we created a new
COVID-19 disinformation classification dataset.
The corpus contains disinformation (e.g. false information or misleading tweets) debunked by the
CoronaVirusFacts Alliance led by the International
Fact-checking Network (IFCN) and has been manually annotated with the categories defined in the
most recent social science research on COVID-19
disinformation (Brennen et al., 2020).
For the remaining challenges, we propose a Classification Aware Neural Topic Model (CANTM)
which combines the benefits of BERT (Devlin
et al., 2019) with a Variational Autoencoder
(VAE)(Kingma and Welling, 2013; Rezende et al.,
2014) based document model (Miao et al., 2016)
to provide:

the classifier directly on the original feature
representation, the classifier is trained based
on generated latent variables from the VAE
(Kingma et al., 2014). In this case the classifier has never seen the ‘real’ training data
during the training, thus reducing the chance
of over-fitting. Our experiment shows that
combining BERT with the VAE framework
improves the classification results on a small
dataset, and is also scalable to larger datasets.
2. Ability to discover the hidden topics related
to the pre-defined classes – the success of
the VAE as a topic model5 has already been
proven in previous research (Miao et al.,
2016, 2017; Card et al., 2018). We further
adapt the VAE-based topic modelling to be
classification-aware, by proposing a stacked
VAE and introducing the classification information directly in the latent topic generation.
3. The classifier is self-explaining6 – in CANTM
the same latent variable (topic) is used in both
the classifier and topic modelling. The topic
can be seen as an explanation of the classification model. We further introduce ‘classassociated topics’ that directly map the topic
words to classifier classes. This enables the
inspection of topics related to a class, thus providing a ‘global’ explanation of the classifier.
The main contributions of this paper are: 1) A
new COVID-19 disinformation corpus with manually annotated categories. 2) A BERT language
model with a VAE topic modelling framework,
which shows a performance improvement (over
using BERT alone) in a low resource classifier
training setting. 3) The CANTM model, which
takes classification information into account for
topic generation. 4) The use of topic modelling
to introduce ‘class-associated’ topics as a global
explanation of the classifier. The corpus and source
code of this work will be open-source, and the web
service and API will be publicly available.

COVID-19 Disinformation Category

The corpus was created in three stages. Firstly,
we collected COVID-19 related debunks of disinformation until 13th April, 2020 published on the

Some researchers distinguish ‘document model’ from
‘topic model’ (Miao et al., 2017; Korshunova et al., 2019). For
simplicity, we consider both as a topic model.

IFCN Poynter website7 . The data has the following
fields derived from the published html tags:
• ‘Claim’:
claim of the disinformation,
rephrased by the IFCN fact-checker;
• ‘Explanation’: the explanation of why this is
a false claim as provided by the fact checkers;
• Source link’: link to original page of the debunk, as published on the fact-checking organisation’s website;
• ‘Date’: date of publication on IFC Poynter
website.
Due to the language restrictions of our human annotators, we could only focus on debunks in English. Thus we applied a language detector8 over
the source of the debunk and filtered out all nonEnglish debunks automatically. In total, 1,480 debunked claims remained.

The next stage involved manual annotation,
where an adapted version of Label Studio9 was
used as a web-based annotation tool. The claim,
explanation and source link were all provided to
the annotators, who assigned to each text the most
relevant one of 10 COVID-19 disinformation categories (see Table 1) and indicated their confidence
(from 0-9) in their decision. Originally, these categories were proposed in a recent social science
analysis of a small sample of 225 debunks(Brennen
et al., 2020). We adopted them unchanged, except
for widening their ‘Public preparedness’ category
to become ‘Public Reaction’ and to include also
disinformation about public protests and other civil
disobedience which are a more recent phenomenon.
In addition, we added a new category ‘Cannot determine (None)’ to enable annotators to flag cases
of COVID-19 disinformation that did not fit any of
the other categories.

We recruited 27 volunteers for the annotation,
and randomly split the data into batches of 20 debunks. In the first round, all annotators worked on
unique batches. In the second round, annotators
received randomised debunks from the first round,
which were then used to measure inter-annotator
agreement (IAA) on COVID-19 disinformation
classification.
The exercise produced 2,192 classified debunks
(see Table 2). Amongst these, 424 samples were
double- or multiple-annotated, from which we calculate the IAA. At this stage, vanilla Cohen’s
Kappa (Cohen, 1960) was only 0.46.
To increase the data quality and provide a good
training sample for our ML model, we applied a
cleaning step to filter the annotations. We first measured annotator quality by observing agreement
change when removing an (anonymous) annotator. This annotator quality was scored based on the
magnitude of score variance. Based on this, we
then removed annotations from the two annotators
with the lowest scores.
We also measured the impact of the annotator
confidence score on the annotation agreement and
the amount of filtered data, and set a confidence
threshold for each annotator, based on the quality
check from the first round (for most annotators,
this threshold was 6). Any annotation below this
threshold was filtered out.
Finally, 1,293 debunks remained with at least
one reliable classification, and IAA was boosted
to 0.7336 (in percentage) and Cohen’s Kappa to
0.7040.

The final dataset was produced by merging the
multiple-annotated debunks on the basis of: 1) majority agreement between the annotators where possible; 2) confidence score – if there is no majority
agreement, we use the highest confidence score.

in each category. The category distribution is consistent with that found in Brennen et al. (2020).

Model

In this section, we review some related work, using
this to explain the motivation for our model. Then
we describe our CANTM model in Section 3.2.
Other related work is reviewed in Section 5.
3.1

Background and Preliminaries

Miao et al. (2016) introduce a generative neural
variational document model (NVDM) that models
the document (x) likelihood p(x) using a variational autoencoder (VAE), which can be described
as:
log p(x) = ELBO + DKL (q(z|x)||p(z|x))
ELBO = Eq(z|x) [log p(x|z)] − DKL (q(z|x)||p(z))
(1)
Where p(z) is the prior distribution of latent variable z. q(z|x) is the inference network (encoder)
used to approximate the posterior distributions
p(z|x). p(x|z) is the generation network (decoder)
to reconstruct the document based on latent variable (topics) z ∼ q(z|x) sampled from the inference network.
According to Equation 1, maximising the ELBO
(evidence lower bound) is equivalent to maximising
the p(x) and minimising the difference between
q(z|x) and p(z|x). Therefore, maximising ELBO
will be the objective function in the NVDM or VAE
framework, or negative ELBO for gradient descent
optimisation. The latent variable z then can be
treated as the latent topics of the document.
NVDM is an unsupervised model, hence we
have no control on the topic generation. In order to
uncover the topics related to the target y (e.g. category, sentiment or coherence) in which we are interested, we can consider several previous approaches.
The Topic Coherence Regularization (NTR) (Ding
et al., 2018) applies the topic coherence as additional loss (i.e. loss L = −ELBO + C) to regularise the model to generate more coherent topics.
SCHOLAR (Card et al., 2018) directly inserts the
target information into the encoder (i.e. q(z|x, y)),
making the latent variable also dependent on the
target. However, when target information is missing at application time, SCHOLAR treats the target

input as a missing feature (i.e. all zero vector) or all
possible combinations. Hence the latent variable
becomes less dependent on the target.
Inspired by the stacked VAE of Kingma et al.
(2014), we combined ideas from NTR and
SCHOLAR. We stacked a classifier-regularised
VAE (M1) and a classifier-aware VAE (M2) enabling the provision of robust latent topic information even at testing time without label information.
3.2

Classifier Aware Neural Topic Model
(CANTM)

The training sample D = (x, xbow , y) is a triple of
the BERT word-pieces sequence representation of
the document (x), a bag-of-words representation of
the document (xbow ) and its associate target label
y.
The general architecture of our model is illustrated in Figure 1. CANTM is a stacked VAE containing 6 sub-modules:
1. M1 encoder (or M1 inference network) q(z|x)
2. M1 decoder (or M1 generation network)
p(xbow |z)
3. M1 Classifier ŷ = f (z)
4. M1 Classifier decoder p(x|ŷ)
5. M2 encoder (or M2 inference network)
q(zs |x, ŷ)
6. M2 decoder (or M2 generation network)
p(xbow |ŷ, zs ) and p(ŷ|zs )
Sub-modules 1 and 2 implement a VAE similar to
NVDM. The modification over original NVDM is
that instead of bag-of-words (xbow ) input and output to the model, our input is a BERT word-pieces
sequence representation of the original document
(x). The reason for this modification is that x can
be seen as a grammar-enriched xbow , and we could
capture better semantic representation in the hidden
layers (e.g. though pre-trained BERT) and benefit the classification and topic generation. Also,
q(z|x) is an approximation of p(z|xbow ), and they
do not have to follow the same condition (Kingma
and Welling, 2013), as our model is still under the
VAE framework. Sub-modules 5 and 6 implement
another VAE that models the joint probability of
document xbow and label ŷ. Note that the label
in M2 is a classifier prediction, hence this label
information will always be available for M2 VAE.
To apply CANTM to unlabelled test data, we fix
the M1 weights that are pre-trained with labelled
data, and only train the M2 model. In Sections

3.2.1 to 3.2.5, we will describe the detail of each
sub-module.
3.2.1 M1 Encoder
The M1 encoder is illustrated in the yellow part of
Figure 1. During the encoding process, the input x
is first transformed into a BERT-enriched representation h using a pre-trained BERT model. We use
the CLS token output from BERT as h. Then linear transformations l1 (h) and l2 (h) transform the h
into parameters of variational distribution that are
used to sample latent variable z. The variational
distribution is a Gaussian distribution (N (µ, σ))
The M1 Encoder is represented in Equation 2
q(z|x) = N (µ, σ)
µ = l1 (h), σ = l2 (h)

(2)

h = BERT (x)
Following previous approaches (Rezende et al.,
2014; Kingma and Welling, 2013; Miao et al.,
2016), a re-parameterisation trick is applied to allow back-propagation to go though the random
node.
z =µ+σ

,  ∼ N (0, 1)

(3)

where  is random noise sampled from a 0 mean
and variance 1 Gaussian distribution. In the decoding process (next section), the document is reconstructed from latent variable z, hence z can be
considered as the document topic.
3.2.2 M1 Decoder
The decoding process (red part in Figure 1) is to
reconstruct xbow from latent variable z. This is
modelled by a fully connected feed-forward (FC)
layer with softmax activation (sigmoid activation
normalised by softmax function. For the rest of the
paper we will describe this as softmax activation for
simplicity). The likelihood of the reconstruction
p(xbow |z) can be calculated by
p(xbow |z) = sof tmax(zR + b)

Where R ∈ R|z|×|V | , and |V | is the vocabulary
size. R is a learnable weight for mapping between
topics and words. The topic words for each topic
can be extracted according to this weight. is the
dot product.
3.2.3 M1 Classifier and Classifier Decoder
The classifier ŷ = sof tmax(F C(z)) is a softmax
activated FC layer. It is based on the same latent
variable z from the M1 encoder. Since the M1 VAE
and classifier are jointly trained based on z, it can
be seen as a ‘class regularized topic’ and also serve

as a ‘global explanation’ of the classifier. Furthermore, ŷ itself can be seen as a compressed topic of
z, or ‘class-associated topic’. The document can
be reconstructed by ŷ in the same way as the M1
decoder, and the likelihood of p(xbow |ŷ) is given
by:
p(xbow |ŷ) = sof tmax(ŷRct + b)

3.2.4

M2 Encoder

The encoding process of M2 (blue part in Figure
1) is similar to M1, but instead of only encoding x,
M2 encodes both the document and predicted label
from the M1 classifier q(zs |x, ŷ). In the M2 encoder process, we first concatenate (⊕) the BERT
representation h and predicted label ŷ, then merge
them through a leaky rectifier (LRelu)(Maas et al.,
2013) activated FC layer. We refer to this as
nonLin in the remainder of the paper.
m = nonLin(h ⊕ ŷ)

3.2.5

M2 Decoder

The decoding process of M2 p(xbow , ŷ|zs ) is divided into two decoding steps (p(xbow |ŷ, zs ) and
p(ŷ|zs )) by Bayes Chain Rule.
The step p(ŷ|zs ) can be considered as M2
classifier, calculated by softmax FC layer, the
likelihood function is modelled as p(ŷ|zs ) =
sof tmax(F C(zs )) ŷ. The M2 classifier will
not be used for classification in this work, only for
the loss calculation (see Section 3.2.6).
In step p(xbow |ŷ, zs ), we first merge ŷ and zs
using nonLin layer t = nonLin(ŷ ⊕ zs ) where
t is a ‘classification aware topic’. Then xbow is
reconstructed using a softmax layer. The likelihood
function is:
p(x|ŷ, zs ) = sof tmax(tRs + b)

Loss Function

= LRelu(F C(h ⊕ ŷ))
As for the M1 encoder, a linear transformation
then maps the merged feature m to the parameters
of the variational distribution represented by the
latent variable of M2 model zs . The variational
distribution is a Gaussian N (µs , σs ):
q(zs |x, ŷ) = N (µs , σs )
µs = l3 (m), σs = l4 (m)

The objective of CANTM is to: 1) maximise ELBOxbow for M1 VAE; 2) maximise
ELBOxbow,ŷ for M2 VAE; 3) minimise crossentropy loss Lcls for M1 classifier and 4) maximise the log likelihood of M1 class decoder
log[p(xbow |ŷ)]. Hence the loss function10 for

The COVID-19 evaluation results are shown
in Table 13. BERT as a strong baseline outperforms SCHOLAR in accuracy by more than
10% and almost 18% F-1 measure. This is expected, because BERT is a discriminative model
pre-trained on large corpora and with a much more
complex model structure than SCHOLAR. Our
model CANTM shows almost 5% increase in accuracy and more than 1% F-1 further improvement over BERT. Training on latent variables with
multi-task loss is thus an efficient way to train
on a small dataset even with a pre-trained embedding/language model.
In the topic modelling task, using BERT in
NVDM has better topic coherence than the vanilla
NVDM, but also increases the perplexity. LDA
has high perplexity in the COVID-19 experiment,
which may be because of the relatively small
dataset and short document length (average 19
words after pre-processing and vocabulary filtering), but LDA still has relatively better topic coherence than both NVDM versions. CANTM has
the best perplexity performance, while SCHOLAR
has the best coherence score. It is very difficult

performance; in Section 4.3 we will discuss the
lack of correlation between topic interpretability
and topic coherence.

IMDB Sentiment Experiment

The IMDB sentiment corpus contains 50,000
movie reviews annotated with positive and negative sentiment. The number of positive and negative labels is balanced in this corpus (25,000 positive, 25,000 negative, average document length
is 282 words). We use the original train-test split
for evaluation, and report the results on the test
set only. All settings including vocabulary size
and pre-processing steps exactly follow Card et al.
(2018). Hence the NVDM, LDA and SCHOLAR
results are as reported in Card et al. (2018).
The IMDB results are shown in Table 5.
The classification results are consistent with the

Table 6: Topic words of the best and worst coherence
topics NPMI score in parentheses

Table 14 shows the topics from CANTM and
SCHOLAR with the best and worst NPMI scores.
We found there is no strong correlation between
coherence score and topic interpretability in supervised topic models.17 The SCHOLAR topics
are included here to demonstrate this is not just the
case in CANTM. With knowledge of the predefined
classes (see Table 1), the lowest coherence topic
(Row 2, CANTM 0.04) in Table 14 can be easily interpreted as a mixture of the topics ‘General
Medical advice’ and ‘Prominent actors’, while the
highest two topics (CANTM 0.50 and SCHOLAR
0.58) are more general words appearing in the text.

Table 7 shows the CANTM-generated IMDB
topics. We select two topics, based on the best

a sentiment-labelled data set, we can clearly see
that the topics generated here are the sentiment

negative sentiment. Row 2 shows the topics related
to positive sentiment in animation movies. Again,
the lowest coherence CANTM topic is still highly
interpretable.

4.3.1 Class-Associated Topics
In Section 3.2.3 we discussed the Class-Associated
Topics, which can be used to visualise the word
distribution in the training data associated with the
pre-defined classes. Table 8 shows an example
of topic words of class-associated topics. As the
topics are guided by the classifier, the topic words
are strongly associated with the pre-defined classes,
and can be used to discover concepts related to
the classes. For example, temperature (topic word
‘hot’ in GenMedAdv) is one of the most connected
concepts to GenMedAdv. In addition, this feature
could be potentially used to check the biases of the
trained classifier.

CANTM with Unlabelled COVID-19
Disinformation
To test the CANTM with unlabelled data, we collected further 4587 COVID-19 debunks (until 26th
May 2020) from IFCN (the same collection as described in Section 2). In the training, we reuse
the pre-trained M1 model (with labelled data), and
only train M2 model with −ELBOxbow,ŷ loss. Table 9 shows the example classification-aware topics
trained with newly collected data. We can clearly
see these topics are still classification-related even
without labels. (Row 1: virus transmission; Row
2:Public authority; Row 3:Medical advice and Row
4:Conspiracies)

Further Related Work

In addition to the work cited in the previous sections, the following research is related to our approach: VAE based topic/document modelling
e.g. Mnih and Gregor (2014) trained a VAE based
document model using the REINFORCE algorithm

(Williams, 1992); Miao et al. (2017) introduce
Gaussian Softmax distribution, Gaussian Stick
Breaking distribution and Recurrent Stick Breaking
process for topic distribution construction. Srivastava and Sutton (2017) proposed a ProdLDA that
applies a Laplace approximation to re-parameterise
Dirichlet distribution in VAE. Zhu et al. (2018) apply a Biterm Topic Model (Cheng et al., 2014; Yan
et al., 2013) into the VAE framework for short text
topic modelling. Topic models with additional
information (e.g. author, label etc.): example
work includes Supervised LDA(Mcauliffe and Blei,
2008), Labeled LDA (Ramage et al., 2009), Sparse
Additive Generative Model (Eisenstein et al., 2011),
Structural Topic Models (Roberts et al., 2014), Author Topic Model (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004), Time
topic model (Wang and McCallum, 2006) and
topic model conditional on any arbitrary Features
(Mimno and McCallum, 2008; Korshunova et al.,
2019). NVDM in text classification: Zeng et al.
(2018); Gururangan et al. (2019), apply NVDM
as additional topics feature in text classification.
Compare to these approaches, CANTM is an asymmetric (different encoder input and decoder output)
VAE that directly use VAE latent variable as classification feature without external features, hence
we can use latent topics as classifier explanation.

Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced the COVID-19 disinformation corpus, which has 10 manually annotated categories of debunked COVID-19 disinformation. After quality control and a filtering process, the inter-annotator agreement average
Cohen’s Kappa is 0.70. We also present a new
classification-aware topic model, that combines the
BERT language model with the VAE document
model framework and demonstrate improved classification accuracy over a vanilla BERT model. In
addition, the classification-aware topics provide
class related topics, which are: a) an efficient way
to discover the class of (pre-defined) related topics,
and b) a proxy explanation of classifier decisions.

Where p(z) = p(zs ) = N (0, I) is a zero mean diagonal multivariate Gaussian prior, hence the
DKL (q(z|x)||p(z)) and DKL (q(zs |x, ŷ)||p(zs )) will be
p(z) = p(zs ) = N (0, I)
DKL (q(z|x)||p(z)) = 0.5(σ 2 + µ2 − log(σ 2 ) − 1)
DKL (q(zs |x, ŷ)||p(zs )) = 0.5(σs2 + µ2s − log(σs2 ) − 1)

Appendix D – Experimental Details

The bag-of-words pre-processing step is the same as (Card et al., 2018): All characters are transformed to
lower case; stopwords18 , punctuation, all tokens less than 3 characters and all tokens that include numbers
are removed.
The pre-processing step for BERT representation is different from bag-of-words pre-processing. For
the COVID-19 corpus, all characters are lowercased, and tokenised by the BERT tokeniser from Huggingface19 (Wolf et al., 2019) Library. The IMDB corpus has a longer average document length, and some of
the documents are longer than the pre-trained BERT length limitation (510 + CLS and SEP). Therefore,
we only keep the first 510 tokens.
The ADAM optimiser parameters are default from the Pytorch Library: Learning Rate = 0.001,
betas=(0.9, 0.999). The number of training epochs are 200 as in Card et al. (2018), with early stopping
when no training loss (classification loss for CANTM) decrease after 4 epochs.

Appendix E – Additional Experiment Results

To ensure fair comparison between CANTM with the BERT classifier, we first compared: 1) BERT with
additional hidden layer that matches the dimension of latent variables (denoted BERT in the result); 2)
BERT without additional hidden layer, i.e. applying BERT [CLS] token output directly for classification
(denoted BERTraw in the result). The COVID corpus results are shown in Table 11; the BERT with
additional hidden layer has better performance in both accuracy and F-measure. Therefore, we report the
BERT result in the paper.

Table 13: COVID-19 disinformation results, n/a stands for not applicable for the model

standard deviations. Except for the None class, standard deviations for CANTM are below 10. From the
results, the most difficult class to classify is ‘None’. This class represents anything that the annotators
could not decide on, and therefore it could be anything that does not belong to the other 9 classes. In
future work, we might need a better algorithm to handle this problem.
Table 13 shows the results of the COVID-19 performance with different baselines. The scores reported
are the same as Table 4 in the paper, but standard deviation is added (standard deviation here is the average
standard deviation from all classes). According to the results, CANTM not only improves the accuracy
and F1 measure over the BERT baseline, but also improves standard deviation.
Table 14 shows the topics of the best and worst NPMI scores from CANTM and the baselines. We
already discussed the fact that topic interpretability is not strongly associated with the NMPI score in
supervised topic models (CANTM and SCHOLAR) in the paper. However, we found additionally that
the NPMI score may have a better connection to the topic interpretability with the unsupervised topic
modelling (LDA and NVDM). The best NMPI LDA topic (LDA0.149) can be interpreted as a mixed topic
of Russian public authority and medical advice. However, the lowest NMPI LDA topic (LDA0.013) is
difficult to interpret.
