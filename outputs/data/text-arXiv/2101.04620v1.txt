Abstract—The COVID-19 pandemic has, worldwide and
up to December 2020, caused over 1.7 million deaths,
and put the world’s most advanced healthcare systems
under heavy stress. In many countries, drastic restriction measures adopted by political authorities, such as
national lockdowns, have not prevented the outbreak of
new pandemic’s waves. In this article, we propose an integrated detection-estimation-forecasting framework that,
using publicly available data published by the national
authorities, is designed to: (i) learn relevant features of
the epidemic (e.g., the infection rate); (ii) detect as quickly
as possible the onset (or the termination) of an exponential
growth of the contagion; and (iii) reliably forecast the
epidemic evolution. The proposed solution is validated by
analyzing the COVID-19 second and third waves in the
USA.

I. I NTRODUCTION
HE new strain of Coronavirus, commonly referred to as COVID-19, has caused, as of December 2020, more than 1.7 million deaths worldwide. The first cases of COVID-19 were found
in early December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, in
the province of Hubei in China. Since then, an
exponential number of infections and deaths have
been registered in most countries, thus convincing
the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare
the new COVID-19 a pandemic on 11th March 2020.
Many governments, hampered by the lack of an

effective cure and a vaccine, decided to undertake
extraordinary social measures, such as travel bans,
closure of schools, universities, shops, factories
and even national lockdowns, causing disruptive
changes in social behavior, global mobility patterns,
and the economies, see e.g. [1]. These measures
resulted in effectively reducing the infection rate
and slowing the spread of the pandemic, thereby
bringing the number of cases under control and
relieving the pressure on the intensive care units.
However, because of the premature relaxation of
these measures, new waves of COVID-19 cases
are rampant in many countries around the world.
Despite the experience of the first wave, many governments have failed to detect these new exponential
growth patterns early, and, consequently, either have
acted too late or have applied light and ineffective countermeasures. This suggests that it is of
paramount importance to develop advanced models
and algorithms that are able to detect the onset of an
exponential growth phase as quickly as possible, and
to forecast the incipient evolution of the infection in
order to provide local and governmental authorities
with enhanced real-time decision support.
Leveraging our knowledge in quickest detection
techniques [2], [3], adaptive Bayesian filtering and
target tracking [4], [5], [6], we propose a framework
that, based on data provided on a daily basis by
authorities (e.g., number of infected and recovered),
is able to i) learn relevant features of the epidemic,
e.g., the infection rate, ii) detect as quickly as
possible the passages from (or back to) a controlled
regime, i.e., a phase during which the number of
new cases is under control, to (from) a critical one,
i.e., characterized by an exponential growth in the
number of infected, and iii) reliably forecast the
epidemic evolution. We exploit recently developed
tools for quickest detection of COVID-19 pandemic
onset, learning of its peculiar features, and forecasting its evolution.

2

The method recently presented in [7] and [8]
is an enhanced version of the celebrated Page’s
CUSUM test [2], [3], specifically tailored to nonstationary pandemic data. This method, called mean
agnostic sequential test (MAST), is able to detect
the onset of an exponential epidemic growth by
properly trading-off the delay in intervention and
the risk of incorrectly declaring an outbreak. The
MAST, properly adjusted (inverting the role of the
two alternative hypotheses), is also able to detect
the termination of a pandemic wave as well. As for
the learning and forecasting tasks, epidemiological
compartmental models, such as the SIR and SEIR
models, are used to describe the epidemic evolution.
Model parameters, such as infection and recovery
rates, are considered time-varying, and are learnt
(or estimated) together with the posterior probability
distributions of the main epidemiological quantities,
e.g., the numbers of infected and recovered individuals; see details in [9].
In [9], we have shown that the temporal evolution
of the outbreak can be reliably forecast as long as
the evolution of model parameters is predictable
from the measured quantities, such as the number of infected and recovered. We have observed
that restrictive measures push the infection rate to
decrease, resulting in a decrease in the new daily
positives, and the ending of an epidemic wave.
On the other hand, when restrictive measures are
relaxed, the infection rate tends to increase causing
the onset of a new pandemic wave. Key to the
accuracy of the forecast is to know which recent
data apply to it; that is, we need the change-points
between controlled and critical regimes. For this
reason, we combine the quickest detection approach
with the Bayesian forecast to develop an integrated
detection-forecast framework. In particular, detecting the beginning, and the termination, of a pandemic wave through MAST enables a more reliable
infection rate estimation to be adopted in accurate
forecast of pandemic evolution up to several weeks
after the detection. The comprehensive set of tools
provided by the proposed framework might assist
the authorities in evaluating the implementation of
pandemic countermeasures. The effectiveness of the
proposed framework is assessed by detecting the
onsets and terminations of the second and third
waves of COVID-19 in the USA, starting from
May 1, 2020, and forecasting the evolution of the
contagion up to December 13, 2020.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the most used compartmental models for epidemiological modeling. Section III
describes the proposed framework that includes the
adaptive Bayesian learning of the model parameters of epidemic evolution, the quickest detection
of an exponential growth, and the forecasting of
the contagion. Concluding remarks are provided in
Section V.
II. E PIDEMIOLOGICAL M ODELING
Compartmental epidemiological models constitute the most well known and widespread methods to model disease transmission dynamics. These
methods assume that a given population is partitioned into a predefined number of compartments
(population subgroups), where each compartment
represents an epidemic state that an individual can
occupy. The SIR model [10] accounts for three
compartments, specifically, susceptible (S), infected
(I), and recovered (R) individuals. A susceptible
individual can contract the virus at a fixed constant
“infection” rate, denoting the rate at which the
individual comes in contact with an infected individual. If infected, an individual develops the disease
and is transitioned to the infected compartment.
Finally, an infected individual recovers or passes
away at a constant “recovery” rate, thereby moving
to the recovered compartment. Recovered people are
considered permanently immune.
Over the years, more complex extensions of the
SIR model have become available in the literature.
For example, the SEIR model assumes that a susceptible individual who comes in contact with an
infected individual does not develop the disease
symptoms immediately, but only after an incubation
period of a certain duration (in the COVID-19 case,
this duration ranges from 3 to 15 days, with a
median value of 5.2 days). Therefore, susceptible
individuals go through an exposed (E) compartment
before developing evident disease symptoms, and,
eventually, move to the infected compartment. In the
SEIRQ model [11], a further compartment is added
for individuals who have contracted the virus and
are quarantined (Q). The SIR-X model [12] takes
into account restrictive measures, such as closure
of schools and shops, or complete lockdown, by
removing susceptible individuals from the disease
spreading process. The majority of epidemiological
models described above assume that the disease

outbreak/ending and forecast its evolution. The daily pandemic data (e.g., daily number of infected and recovered) are pre-processed to
reduce their variability. Data are then used by the quickest detection process [7], [8] to evaluate the growth rate and the MAST statistic.
Simultaneously, the data are utilized in the Bayesian learning process [9] to update and predict the epidemiological model states and
parameters. If the MAST statistic exceeds the threshold, an onset (termination) of a pandemic wave is declared. Accordingly, the MAST
statistic is reset and properly adjusted to be able to detect, from the next day, a following termination (onset), and the infection rate strategy
is chosen to reliably forecast the epidemic evolution [9].

spreads inside a unique population, e.g., city, region, country. Metapopulation models [13], [14]
go beyond compartmental models by adding a further spatial dimension and considering a network
of spatially separated subpopulations among which
individuals can move freely, and come in contact
with each other.
Most of the aforementioned compartmental models describe the flow dynamics from one compartment to another by means of a set of stochastic
differential equations. In most cases, the main model
parameters are fixed and do not vary with time. In
our proposed framework, described in the following
sections, we assume that relevant epidemiological
model parameters are time-varying to better capture
the effects of mobility and possible restrictive measures. These parameters are then estimated online
along with the epidemiological model states.
III. L EARNING , DETECTION AND FORECAST
This section describes the proposed decisiondirected forecasting framework (see Fig. 1) designed
to learn the relevant characteristics of the epidemic,
detect the passages from a controlled to a critical
regime (and vice-versa), and forecast the epidemic
evolution.
A. Bayesian learning of epidemic evolution
The approach we adopt to learn and track the epidemic evolution, recently proposed in [9], is based
on the discretization of the continuous stochastic
differential equations that describe a compartmental
epidemiological model, and on the assumption that

most model parameters, such as infection and recovery rates, are time-varying. These model parameters
take their values on pre-specified and rich finite
sets, and their time-evolution can be described by a
properly designed Markovian model.
We want to track the evolution of 𝑁 epidemiological model states, e.g., the numbers of infected and
recovered people, as well as 𝑀 model parameters,
e.g., the infection and recovery rates, based on the
daily (possibly partial) observation of the states.
These observations are affected by a certain level
of randomness, unavoidable in real-world measurements, modeled as superimposed “noise”. The lower
branch of Fig. 1 shows a high-level block diagram of the Bayesian sequential learning algorithm
that takes as input daily pandemic data, such as
the number of infected and recovered individuals,
properly filtered to mitigate the effects of gross
errors, missing values, and delays in the reported
data. Then, it computes, the posterior probability
density functions (pdfs) of the 𝑀 model parameters,
as well as the pdfs of the 𝑁 model states. This
is achieved by applying the basic principles of
Bayesian sequential estimation, which involves a
prediction step and an update step. During the prediction step, the predicted pdfs of the 𝑀 parameters
and of the 𝑁 states are calculated according to the
dynamic model defined by the set of discrete-time
stochastic difference equations. During the update
step, the new observation is processed and used to
recalculate improved versions of the posterior pdfs
of model states and parameters. Finally, estimates of

threshold, which is selected to trade-off the decision
delay, i.e., the average time elapsed from the actual
change of regime to the detection, and the so-called
risk, i.e., the reciprocal of the mean time between
two consecutive false alarms; a false alarm is here
defined as a threshold crossing when no change
has occurred. The risk plays the role of the false
alarm probability in the classical detection theory.
The results on the performance of MAST, presented
in [7], [8], show that the decision delay required
to reveal the onset of an exponential phase is in
the order of a few days, with a risk that scales
exponentially with the delay. In [7], an analysis of

a concrete example of the application to Italian
and US data using the discrete-time stochastic SIR
model is also provided. The same implementation,
enhanced by the information provided by MAST,
will be used for the data analysis of the second
and third waves of COVID-19 in the USA, in
Section IV.

The proposed epidemic change detection and
forecasting algorithm is applied to the COVID-19
dataset from the USA in order to recognize the
beginning and the termination of the second and
third waves, and infer the progression of the pandemic. As described earlier, Bayesian learning uses
the number of infected individuals and the number
of recovered individuals (which encompasses both
hospital releases plus deaths), while the quickest
detection, implemented through the MAST, uses the
number of daily new positive individuals. These
numbers, along with many others, are provided daily
by the authorities, and have been collected and made
publicly available by the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) since the beginning of the COVID-19
emergency [15]. Fig. 2 shows the 21-day average
of numbers of infected, recovered, and daily new
positives from March 1 to December 13, 2020.
There are clearly three identifiable waves, each
characterized by rapid growth in the number of daily
new positives; these regions of exponential growth
are highlighted with a darker background for clarity.
Actually, the third wave is likely to be a delayed
second wave in different geographic regions of the
U.S., as a state-by-state analysis seems to imply.
The MAST statistic used for the onset detection
of the second wave is calculated from May 1, and
is shown in solid magenta in Fig. 3. The threshold
is obtained from the analysis in [7], and is set
assuming a risk level of 10−4 , which corresponds
to accepting, on average, a false detection every 27
years. The onset of the second wave is declared on
June 22, the day on which the statistic crosses the
threshold for the first time. On this day, the MAST
statistic used to detect termination of the second
wave is also initiated, shown in solid dark yellow in
Fig. 3, leading to a termination detection on August
12. Likewise, the onset of the third wave is declared
on September 29, and it is still ongoing.
While the MAST statistic is computed for detection purposes, the Bayesian learning algorithm
continuously estimates the epidemiological model’s
states and parameters. As an example, Fig. 4 shows

mimics a scenario in which no countermeasures are
taken to slow down the infection rate. Forecast “B”,
instead, mimics a scenario in which restrictions are
applied to limit the epidemic. Therefore, if, on the
day of forecasting, the infection rate is increasing,
one assumes that it keeps increasing for 15 days
with the same estimated slope, then decreases for 30
days with the opposite slope (to model the rightward
skew in infection distribution), and finally maintains
the attained value for the remaining period; this is
illustrated with a dashed green line in Fig. 4. On
the other hand, if, on the day of forecasting, the
infection rate is decreasing, it keeps decreasing for
15 days and then maintains the realized value for the
remaining period, as in forecast scenario A. Unlike
[9], the estimated slope of the infection rate on a
given day is here computed by averaging the slopes
since the day MAST declares a change (either of
the onset or the termination of a pandemic wave).
If the slope is not coherent with the declared regime
(that is, positive slope under critical regime and negative slope under controlled regime) because of the
random fluctuation in the infection rate estimation,
then the slope used in the forecast is set to zero.
Other strategies can be investigated for improving
the forecast reliability; however, such investigations
are delegated to future work.
The evolution of the epidemic in terms of the
number of infected individuals in these two cases,
i.e., forecast scenario A and forecast scenario B, is
shown in Fig. 5 with a dashed red line and a dashed
green line, respectively, and compared with the true
number of infected individuals, i.e., the blue solid
line. Both the forecasts are close to the actual evolution of the number of infected, particularly in the
following 2-3 months. Forecast B clearly foresees
a lower number of infected compared to forecast
A, since it is assumed that countermeasures to the
spreading of the virus will take place after 15 days
from the detection of the onset. A more rigorous
evaluation of the proposed Bayesian learning and
forecast algorithm is provided in Fig. 6, that shows
the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for both
strategies and for three different forecast horizons
𝐾, i.e., 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Apart from the time
interval of roughly between July 19 and August 13,
the MAPE is below 5% for both forecast scenarios
A and B and for horizons of 2 and 4 weeks, and
below 10% for a horizon of 8 weeks. Between
July 19 and August 13, the MAPE increases —

7

still below 5% and 15% for horizons of 2 and 4
weeks, respectively — as effect of the reduction of
the infection rate that follows its peak reached on
August 2 (see Fig. 4). Indeed, independently of the
forecast scenario, one still assumes — without any
further knowledge — that the infection rate keeps
increasing for 15 days, and the closer one gets to
August 2, the more the forecasted infection rate
deviates from the actual one.
V. C ONCLUSION
Leveraging known concepts from the fields of signal processing and communication, such as quickest detection theory, target tracking and adaptive
Bayesian learning, we have proposed an integrated
detection-estimation-forecasting framework, which
is able to reliably detect the onset and termination
of pandemic waves, as well as to track the epidemiological evolution. A pandemic wave onset (termination) is determined by an infection rate increase
(decrease), also referred to as critical (controlled)
regime. The detection of such regimes and the
ability to track relevant epidemiological factors are
crucial to determine an infection rate evolution scenario for reliable epidemic forecasting performance.
On the other hand, an erroneous scenario modeling can imply a significant degradation in forecast
performance. Experimental validation on COVID19 data from the USA has shown that the proposed
framework is able to reliably detect two consecutive
exponential outbreaks on June 23 and October 23.
Furthermore, the proposed methodology is able to
forecast the epidemic evolution in a temporal horizon from 2 to 8 weeks in two different scenarios,
with and without restrictions,while maintaining a
mean absolute percentage error between 5% to 10%.
