Abstract
Currently, there are about 14 ongoing clinical studies on low dose radiotherapy (LDRT) for
COVID-19 pneumonia. One of the underlying assumptions is that irradiation of 0.5–1.5 Gy is
effective at ameliorating viral pneumonia. Its rationale, however, relies on early human case series
or animal studies mostly obtained in the pre-antibiotic era, where rigorous statistical analyses were
not performed. It therefore remains unclear whether those early data support such assumptions.
With standard statistical survival models, and based on a systematic literature review, we reanalyzed fourteen radiobiological animal datasets published in 1925-1973 in which animals
received mostly fractionated doses of radiation before or after bacterial/viral inoculation, and
assessing various health endpoints (mortality, pneumonia morbidity). In most datasets absorbed
doses did not exceed 7 Gy. Various different model systems (rabbits, guinea pigs, dogs, cats, mice)
and types of challenging infection (bacterial, viral) are considered. For seven studies that evaluated
post-inoculation radiation exposure (more relevant to LDRT for COVID-19 pneumonia) the results
are heterogeneous, with two studies showing a significant increase (p<0.001) and another showing
a significant decrease (p<0.001) in mortality associated with radiation exposure. Among the
remaining four studies, mortality risk was non-significantly increased (p>0.3) in two studies and
non-significantly decreased in two others (p>0.05). For pre-inoculation exposure the results are
also heterogeneous, with six (of eight) datasets showing a significant increase (p<0.01) in mortality
risk associated with radiation exposure and the other two showing a significant decrease (p<0.05)
in mortality (and in one case pneumonitis morbidity) risk. Collectively, these data do not provide
clear support for reductions in morbidity or mortality associated with post-infection radiation
exposure. For pre-infection radiation exposure the inconsistency of direction of effect makes this

body of data difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, one must be cautious about adducing evidence
from the published reports of these old animal datasets.

Introduction
Low dose radiotherapy (LDRT) for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia was
proposed in early April 2020 [1, 2]. At least 14 clinical studies are currently ongoing in 7 countries
[3]. The rationale for clinical benefit, in other words the effectiveness of irradiation at the level of
0.5–1.5 Gy in treating viral pneumonia, largely relies on early human case studies or animal studies
mostly obtained in the pre-antibiotic era, when a number of attempts were made to treat various
non-cancer diseases with ionizing radiation, including virally- or bacterially-associated
pneumonia. An influential paper underlying a number of proposals made for use of LDRT to treat
COVID-19 pneumonia [1, 2] was Calabrese and Dhawan in 2013 [4] who reviewed 17 papers (all
published before 1945) describing about 15 mostly relatively small case series, describing
outcomes from low dose radiotherapy with X-rays (LDRT) for pneumonia. Their sampling
framework and doses used are unknown, and therefore they are subject to ascertainment bias and
are effectively uninterpretable. Calabrese and Dhawan [4] also identified four radiobiological
animal studies of post-inoculation LDRT, all from experiments done in the 1940s, namely Fried
[5] using a guinea pig model, Lieberman et al. [6] using a canine model, Baylin et al [7] using a
cat model, and Dubin et al. [8] using a murine model, the first two of these for bacterially-induced
pneumonia and the last two for virally-induced pneumonia. However, Calabrese and Dhawan [4]
did not consider four other radiobiological studies relating to post-inoculation RT, nor results of
eight others relating to pre-inoculation RT, and did not attempt any statistical reanalysis of these
old data.
The aim of the present paper is to look at the totality of published radiobiological data
relating to radiation exposure before or after inoculation with a viral or bacterial agent likely to
result in pneumonia. Because of the age of the data being considered there are shortcomings in the

4

original statistical analysis that was performed – indeed in all but a few cases [9, 10] there was no
formal statistical analysis in the original reports. It is the purpose of this paper to report reanalysis
of the data abstracted from the original publications so far as that is achievable, using standard
statistical survival models in order to assess modification of pneumonia morbidity or mortality risk
by radiation exposure before or after inoculation.

Methods
We aimed to capture all radiobiological datasets relating to moderate or LDRT whether given
before or after viral or bacterial inoculation leading to pneumonia. We searched literature by means
of a PubMed search (using terms ((radiation OR radiotherapy) AND pneumonia AND viral AND
animal) OR ((radiation OR radiotherapy) AND pneumonia AND bacterial AND animal))
conducted on 2020-8-8, which returned 184 articles. We also searched for citations of the articles
of Fried [5], Lieberman et al. [6], Baylin et al [7], Dubin et al. [8], and an authoritative
contemporary review (of 1951) by Taliaferro and Taliaferro [11] on the same date. We did not
restrict by date or language of the publication. We selected from these searches all relevant articles
with information on radiobiological animal experiments in which there was any type of ionizing
radiation exposure with determination of mortality or morbidity from bacterially- or virallyinduced pneumonia. The datasets used are listed in Table 1. It should be noted that the datasets we
used include three of the four cited by Calabrese and Dhawan [4], but did not include the paper of
Fried [5] which we judged did not contain any quantitatively useful information. In Appendix A
we provide details of the process used to abstract data from the publications that we identified as
being potentially informative. The data was abstracted independently three times by MPL, WZ
and RvD. We convert the given free-in-air dose in legacy units radiation absorbed dose (rad),

5

roentgen (R) or rep in all studies to absorbed dose in Gray (Gy) via the scaling 1 R/rep =0.00877
Gy. 1 rad = 0.01 Gy [12].

Statistical methods
Details of the statistical models fitted are given in Table 1, and some further details on adjustments
used are also given in the summary Table 2. Mortality and morbidity risks in the radiobiological
cohorts of Murphy and Sturm [13], Lieberman et al. [6] and Dubin et al. [8] were assessed using
a Cox proportional hazards models [14], with time after radiation exposure, if that followed the
inoculation, or time after bacterial or viral inoculation, if that followed the radiation exposure, as
timescale, in which the relative risk (RR) (=hazard ratio) of death for animal i at time a after
inoculation was given by a linear model in dose:

RRi [a, Di | α ]= [1 + α Di ]

(1)

or alternatively using a log-linear model in dose:

RRi [a, Di | α ] = exp[α Di ]

(2)

where Di is the total dose (in Gy), α is the excess relative risk coefficient (ERR) per unit dose
(Gy). For the dataset of Murphy and Sturm [13] the only usable information available is the fact
of irradiation of the mice (yes or no), so that the model fitted is of the form:
(3)

RRi [a,1exposurei | α ] = exp[α1exposurei = yes ]

For most of the other datasets a linear logistic model is fitted to the data (generally on number of
animals that died in each group):

Pi [a, Di | α 0 , α1 ] = exp[α 0 ][1 + α1 Di ] / [1 + exp[α 0 ][1 + α1 Di ]]

(4)

In some cases the more standard loglinear logistic model is fitted to the data (generally on number
of animals that died in each group):
6

Pi [a, Di | α 0 , α1 ] = exp[α 0 + α1 Di ] / [1 + exp[α 0 + α1 Di ]]

(5)

For the data of Fried [15], numbering only 7 animals and using as outcome improvement in
pneumonia in relation to unirradiated controls, an exact logistic model was used [16], as non-exact
methods did not converge. It is well known that the excess odds ratio (EOR) approximates to the
excess relative risk [17]. All confidence intervals (CIs) and two-sided p-values are profile-partiallikelihood based [18]. In the murine dataset of Dubin et al. [8] in various subgroups risks were
assessed in relation to radiation dose administered after inoculation or dose before inoculation. In
the murine dataset of Quilligan et al [19] pre-inoculation dose was given to all animals. There is
some uncertainty associated with the number of mice in the first of the control groups in this
dataset, so a range is employed, spanning the plausible range of 6-10 mice, with 8 as the central
estimate (Table 2). The model was stratified by the three experiments reported in the data of Dubin
et al. [8] and by the three groups used by Lieberman et al. [6]. Tables B3 and B8 and Figure 1 and
2 show the risks in relation to dose for these two datasets. In various other datasets adjustment was
made for various other covariates, as detailed in Tables B1-B15. In the fits to the pneumonia
intensity data of Baylin et al. [7] we used either loglinear logistic regression (as described above)
comparing each pneumonia intensity group and those with greater intensity vs every group with
reduced intensity and because of the small number of animals (22) we also employed exact logistic
methods [16]; we also used ordinal regression with log-linear link [20] fitting to all the ordered
intensity groups. In fits of the days of infection data of Baylin et al. [7] we used a linear regression
model, estimating the CIs via the bias-corrected advanced method [21]. All models were fitted via
Epicure [22], R [23] or LogXact [16]. Two-sided levels of statistical significance are reported in
all cases, with a conventional threshold for type I error of 2-sided p<0.05 used to assign statistical
significance. All statistical analyses were independently performed by MPL and WZ to check for
7

concordance. All datasets and analysis files are available in online supporting information
(Appendix C).

Results
We present results of analyses of risk in relation to whether radiation exposure occurred after
inoculation or before inoculation. The results are given in summary form in Table 2, which also
provides summary details of the models used and assumptions made in fitting, and in more detail
in Appendix B Tables B1-B15.
Irradiation after inoculation
Table 2 (and Table B1) demonstrates that there is a highly significant (p<0.001) increased risk of
death associated with X-ray exposure after inoculation with Pneumococcus in the murine data of
Murphy and Sturm [13], with RR = 3.67 (95% CI 1.84, 7.61). Table 2 (and Table B2) shows that
there are weak indications (0.05 < p <0.1) of decreased risk of pneumonia with post-inoculation
dose in the dataset of Fried [15], whether for all guinea pigs or restricting to the six guinea pigs
receiving Staphylococcus aureus inoculation. There is a highly significant decreasing trend
(p<0.001) of mortality with post-inoculation dose in the dataset of Lieberman et al. [6] with EOR
per Gy = -0.23 (95% CI -0.24, -0.16) (Table 2, Table B3), as also shown by Figure 1. However,
Table B3 shows that this is largely driven by a single group, group 3, as also shown by Figure 2.
The three groups in the study of Lieberman et al [6], were treated with slightly different X-ray

8

energies, 80 kVp, 135 kVp and 200 kVp, respectively, and mean doses also slightly differed, 0.947
Gy, 1.639 Gy and 2.027 Gy, respectively (Table B3).
There are few indications of trend of degree of pneumonia infection with dose in the feline
data of Baylin et al. [7], whether using logistic, exact logistic or ordinal models (Table 2, Table
B4). However, Table B5 indicates that there is a significant decreasing trend of days of acute
infection with dose in this dataset, with days of infection / Gy changing by -2.56 (95% CI -4.59, 0.33) (p=0.015), i.e., duration of infection decreasing with dose, as also shown by Figure 3.
There is a highly significant increasing trend (p<0.001) of mortality risk with dose after
endemic coccobacillus infection in the rat data of Bond et al. [24], whether adjusting for likelihood
of infection or not (Table 2, Table B6), with EOR per Gy = 0.81 (95% CI 0.72, 0.91), as also
shown by Figure 4.
Radiation administration before and after inoculation
There is no significant trend (p>0.4) with post-inoculation dose in the data of Dubin et al. [8],
whether using linear or log-linear models, which is confirmed also by Figure 1 (Table B7).
However, there is a borderline significant decreasing trend (p=0.029) of mortality with preinoculation dose in this dataset, with EOR/Gy = -0.62 (95% CI -0.90, -0.09) (Table 2, Table B7)
again confirmed by Figure 1.
Irradiation before inoculation
There is a non-significant positive trend with pre-inoculation dose (p>0.4) in the murine data of
Tanner and McConchie [25] (Table 2, Table B8, Figure 5); results did not appreciably vary with
the type of model used (linear logistic, log-linear logistic) or whether or not adjustment was made
for the virus concentration (Table B8).

9

In the murine data of Beutler and Gezon [26] there are highly significant (all p<0.005)
increasing trends of mortality with post-inoculation dose, whether in relation to mouse-adapted or
egg-adapted PR8 influenza A virus and irrespective of the type of statistical model (linear logistic,
loglinear logistic) used; for example with a linear logistic model the EOR per Gy is 0.16 (95% CI
0.06, 0.30) (Table 2, Table B9), and as also shown in Figure 6. The morbidity trends exhibit more
heterogeneity, so that for the mouse-adapted virus the trends are generally negative, so that for
example with a linear logistic model the EOR per Gy is -0.17 (95% CI -0.18, -0.15) (Table B9);
however, for the egg-adapted virus the trends are generally positive with dose, so that for example
with a linear logistic model the EOR per Gy is 0.41 (95% CI 0.14, 0.85) (Table B9), as also shown
in Figure 6.
In the Swiss mice data of Hale and Stoner [27] there is no overall trend (p>0.2) of mortality
with radiation dose given before inoculation with type III pneumococcus. However, if attention is
restricted to the animals that received inoculation there is a highly significant increasing trend with
dose (p<0.001), so that the EOR per Gy is 1.40 (95% CI 0.39, 5.47) (Table 2, Table B10). The
same researchers went on to study a wider range of infective agents in the same strain of mice, and
observed a generally highly significant (p<0.005) increase in mortality risk associated with
radiation before inoculation with influenza virus, pneumococcus type III bacterial infection or
Trichinella spiralis larval infection [28], whether adjusted or not for type of first immunizing
infection, so that for example without such adjustment and excluding the Trichinella spiralis
challenge infections the EOR/Gy = 1.40 (95% CI 0.39, 5.47) (Table B11, Table 2).
There is a highly significant (p<0.001) increase in mortality risk in the C57BL mouse data
of Quilligan et al [19] associated with post-influenza-inoculation radiation dose with EOR/Gy

10

ranging from 3.73 (95% CI 0.42, 85.85) to 4.75 (95% CI 0.56, 108.10) depending on how many
mice are assumed to be in the first control group (Table B12, Table 2).
Pneumonitis morbidity and mortality were significantly decreased (p<0.001) after 3.5 Gy
whole body air dose exposure in adult male albino CF-1 mice in the data of Berlin [9], so that for
pneumonitis morbidity the EOR/Gy = -0.24 (95% CI -0.28, -0.17) and for pneumonitis mortality
the EOR/Gy = -0.21 (95% CI -0.26, -0.14) (Table B13, Table 2). In contrast Table 2 (see also
Table B14) and Figure 7 show reanalysis of slightly later data of Berlin and Cochran [10], which
exhibits slightly heterogeneous results, with one set of experiments (given in Table III of Berlin
and Cochran [10]) indicating a highly significant increase (p=0.009) in influenza mortality,
whether or not adjusted for mode of administration of virus, but a different experimental set
(reported in Table II of the paper) showing no significant effect (p>0.1) of radiation exposure on
influenza morbidity or mortality. These experiments use a similar murine system, also given 3.5
Gy whole body air-dose exposure, as in the earlier paper of Berlin [9]. Lundgren et al [29] used a
novel type of radiation exposure, aerosolized 144CeO2, which delivers localized β dose to the lungs
of C57BL/6J mice. There was a small but highly significant increase in mortality risk associated
with radiation exposure, with EOR/Gy = 0.008 (95% CI 0.002, 0.019, p=0.002) (Table 2, Table
B15).

Discussion
We have re-analyzed fourteen radiobiological animal datasets, dating from the mid 1920s to the
early 1970s, in which bacterial or viral agents were administered to induce pneumonia in animals
that were also exposed to varying fractionated doses of radiation before or after inoculation. The
statistical analysis in the original papers was limited, indeed in all but two cases [9, 10] there was

11

no formal statistical analysis in the publications. We therefore judged it necessary to statistically
reanalyze the data from the original publications with standard statistical models.
For the seven studies that evaluated post-inoculation radiation exposure (which is more
relevant to LDRT for COVID-19 pneumonia) the results are heterogeneous, with two studies, those
of Murphy and Sturm [13] and Bond et al [24], showing a significant increase (p<0.001) in
mortality associated with radiation exposure, and another, that of Lieberman et al [6], showing a
significant decrease (p<0.001) in mortality associated with radiation exposure. Among the
remaining four studies, mortality risk was non-significantly increased in two studies, those of
Baylin et al [7] and Tanner and McConchie [25] (p=0.358, p=0.469, respectively), and nonsignificantly decreased in two others, those of Fried [15] and Dubin et al [8] (p=0.075, p=0.451,
respectively). Risks were only elevated in the third of the three groups studied by Lieberman et al
[6]; the groups were treated with slightly different X-ray energies, and mean doses also slightly
differed (see Results and Table B3). It is possible that these variations in mean dose and radiation
energy may have some bearing on the differences observed (Table B3). For pre-inoculation
exposure the results are also heterogeneous, with six (of eight) datasets showing significant
increase in mortality risk associated with radiation exposure, namely those of Beutler and Gezon
[26], Hale and Stoner [27], Hale and Stoner [28], Berlin and Cochran [10], Quilligan et al [19] and
Lundgren et al [29] (p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.009, p<0.001, p=0.002, respectively), and
the other two, those of Dubin et al [8], and Berlin [9] showing a significant decrease in mortality
(and in one case pneumonitis morbidity) risk (p=0.029, p<0.001, respectively). There was no clear
systematic explanation for the heterogeneity in direction of effects, but reasons could include the
different model systems (rabbits, dogs, cats, mice) being used, also possibly because of the various
types of challenging infection, which included both bacterial agents (Pneumococcus types I, III,

12

Staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus, Coccobacillus) and viral ones (swine influenza, feline,
Thylers mouse encephalitis, influenza type A, CAM A-prime influenza, influenza A/PR8, and
influenza A0) (see Table 1). It is possible that the range of doses used, and the variable degree of
fractionation employed may also be factors, although there does not appear to be an obvious pattern
linking these to the direction or strength of effect, as shown by Tables 1 and 2. More recently,
Hasegawa et al [30] showed that irradiation before influenza vaccination and a succeeding lethal
challenge influenza inoculation exacerbates mortality from influenza, but that vaccination prior to
irradiation confers protection against a subsequent challenge influenza inoculation. Dadachova et
al [31] reported that targeted radionuclide immunotherapy induces Streptococcus pneumoniae
killing in vivo, thereby alleviating bacterial pneumonia. As can be inferred, both these publications
[30, 31] address somewhat different questions to those of this paper.
The major strength of the present analysis is that we use standard statistical models to assess
the totality of published radiobiological data on LDRT given either before or after virally- or
bacterially-induced pneumonia. Moreover, unlike the review of Calabrese and Dhawan [4] we
have undertaken a systematic review of the literature. The data we used was independently
abstracted from the published reports by three of the authors. A significant weakness is the
heterogeneity in the study designs, both the animal model systems and the infective agents used,
alluded to above. There is some uncertainty as to precisely what experimental procedures were
followed in some of these old datasets and one cannot be sure that the experimenters in these
studies were blinded to the exposure status of the animals. This is exemplified by the study of
Lieberman et al [6], where in the third group, most recovered animals received irradiation at 3
days after bacterial inoculation, which exceeded the average lifetime of 2.1 days in control
(infected but not irradiated) animals: this would suggest an experimental selection bias. It is also

13

not always clear what the disease endpoints were, as for example in the data of Bond et al [24].
Last, about a third (5/14) of the radiobiological datasets we analyzed here dealt exclusively with
bacterial pneumonia, which is less relevant to discussion of LDRT for COVID-19 pneumonia, due
to a significant difference in the pathogenesis of bacterial and viral pneumonia. Reliant as we were
on electronic publication databases (in particular PubMed, ISI Thompson) it is possible that our
literature search could have missed some relevant older datasets, given the incompleteness in
coverage of publications 80 or more years previously.
Altogether, early radiobiology data do not suggest that there are strong variations in mortality
or morbidity following radiation exposure after bacterial or viral inoculation. In particular, the
heterogeneity in the results of our statistical analysis suggest that these early datasets do not serve
as strong supportive evidence that LDRT of infected individuals reduces mortality. Although there
are stronger indications of modifications of risk by radiation exposure before inoculation, the
inconsistency of direction of effect makes this body of data difficult to interpret and has little
relevance to LDRT for COVID-19 pneumonia.
Rödel et al [32] reviewed some of the human epidemiological and radiobiological literature
on LDRT. While acknowledging limitations in understanding the possible mechanism, Rödel et al
[32] suggested that LDRT may stimulate anti-viral immunity via the modulating effects of type I
interferons in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Rödel et al [32] concluded that LDRT
with a single dose of 0.5 Gy to the lungs warranted clinical investigation, while acknowledging
the need for strict monitoring and disease phase-adapted treatment based on lung function tests
and clinical markers (e.g. IL-6 and D-dimer in serum). Schaue and McBride [33] echoed some of
the concerns of Rödel et al [32] on the importance of correctly timing the use of LDRT in treatment
of SARS-CoV-2, but were much more cautious, and suggested that, for example, it was unlikely

14

that LDRT would effectively counter the virally-induced cytokine storm that is a feature of the
more severe forms of infection. Schaue and McBride [33] and even more forcefully Kirsch et al
[34] suggested that the known deleterious adverse late health effects of 0.5-1.5 Gy administered
to the lungs via increased risk of cancer and circulatory disease [35, 36] must be weighed against
the uncertain therapeutic benefits of LDRT. Kirsch et al concluded that “based on the available
data, the potential risks of such LDRT trials outweigh the potential benefits” and recommended
that “further preclinical work is needed to demonstrate efficacy of radiotherapy to provide
scientific justification for a clinical trial in patients with COVID-19” [34].
Collectively, these animal data do not provide clear support for reductions in morbidity or
mortality associated with post-infection radiation exposure. For pre-infection radiation exposure,
the inconsistency of direction of effect makes this body of data difficult to interpret. Nevertheless,
one must be cautious about adducing evidence from the published reports of these old animal
datasets.

Appendix A. Description of data extraction
In this appendix we outline the steps taken to transcribe data from the 14 papers relating to
radiobiological animal experiments produced by our literature search.

Experiments with irradiation after inoculation
Murphy and Sturm [13]
Data was transcribed from all three columns of text Figure 2 (p.252) into a table, giving
information on group number, animal number, X-ray exposure status, heat exposure status, amount
of serum, amount of culture, days survival. The days survival entry requires somewhat
approximately translating the length of the given horizontal bars into survival length. This item
was rounded to whole numbers (integers). There was information on 75 individual rabbits in this
data.

Fried [15]
Data was transcribed from Table II (p.437) for experiment no 7 into a table, giving information on
animal number, injection status, Radiation dose (Gy – converting 1 r = 0.00877 Gy), radiation time
post injection, killed hours after injection, improvement (vs unirradiated controls) (coded as + or
-), no improvement (vs unirradiated controls) (coded as + or -), doubtful improvement (vs
unirradiated controls) (coded as + or -) and worsening (vs unirradiated controls) (coded as + or -).

Lieberman et al [6]
Data was transcribed from Tables 1-3 (pp.97-98) into a table giving dog number, group number,
blood culture (coding “….” = -1, “+”=1, “++”=2, “+++”=3, “++++”=4, “0”=0) pneumonia type

26

(“I”=1,”III”=3), radiation energy (keV)(from table title), radiation 1st day (Gy converting 1 r =
0.00877 Gy), radiation 2nd day (Gy converting 1 r = 0.00877 Gy), radiation 3rd day (Gy converting
1 r = 0.00877 Gy), radiation total (Gy converting 1 r = 0.00877 Gy), radiation total excluding day
of death (Gy converting 1 r = 0.00877 Gy), death day, dead (coding 1=dead, 0=no death). For
those animals that are indicated as having recovered (animal 519 in Table 2, animals 316, 383,
385, 481, 588 in Table 3) a large value (9999) was used as the end of follow-up time (Death day),
with death coded as 0 for these 6 animals, so that the records for these animals only contribute to
the denominator in the Cox model fit.

Baylin et al [7]
We constructed a table from Table 1 (p.474) with group number, cat number, area treated, degree
of pneumonia, 24 h dose (Gy, calculated as 1 r = 0.00877 Gy) post-symptoms, 48 h dose (Gy,
calculated as 1 r = 0.00877 Gy), 72 h dose (Gy, calculated as 1 r = 0.00877 Gy) post-symptoms,
length of days in acute phase. It should be noted that in cats treated 24 h after onset of symptoms
(Group II), when 100 r is given twice (cats 14, 16) that means 100 r (0.877 Gy) is given at 24 h
and again at 48 h, so there were two separate entries in these columns. Likewise for cats treated 48
h after onset of symptoms (Group III) when 100 r (0.877 Gy) is given twice (cats 21, 22) then 100
r (0.877 Gy) is given at 48 h and again at 72 h after onset of symptoms.

Tanner and McConchie [25]
We constructed a table from Tables II and III (p.102) with numbers of LD-50 doses, radiation dose
(Gy, calculated as 1 r = 0.00877 Gy), radiation portal, virus dilution, radiation start day, radiation
end day, radiation spacing (days between fractions), number of mice, number died. It should be

27

noted that the mice are irradiated daily, so for example in the 1st two groups mice receive 50 r
(0.439 Gy) or 100 r (0.877 Gy) daily on days 1 through 6 after inoculation, so that cumulative
doses of 300 r (2.631 Gy) or 600 r (5.262 Gy) are given to these groups and similarly for all other
entries in Table II and Table III.

Bond et al [24]
We used a combination of the data in Table 1 (p.28) and Table 2 (p.29) to create a table with fields
for experiment number, series, sex, age start weeks (minimum), age start weeks (maximum),
infection status [coded as likely unexposed to infection, probably exposed to infection, highly
probably exposed to infection – so that Experiments 1 and 2 were both coded as probably exposed
to infection, and all except the last group of Experiment 3 were coded as highly probably exposed
to infection, the last group of Experiment 3 being coded as likely unexposed to infection],
minimum radiation dose (in Gy, using 1 r =0.00877 Gy), maximum radiation dose (in Gy, using 1
r =0.00877 Gy), deaths infected, deaths total, survived infected, survived total. These numbers
were used to compute entries for numbers of deaths among infected and uninfected animals, which
formed the basis of the analysis. The radiation dose used was the mean of the minimum and
maximum doses.

Experiments with irradiation before and after inoculation
Dubin et al [8]
Data was transcribed on the experiment number, group number, mice per group, mouse number,
dose (Gy, calculated as 1 r = 0.00877 Gy) 24 h post-inoculation, dose (Gy, calculated as 1 r =
0.00877 Gy) 48 h post-inoculation, dose (Gy, calculated as 1 r = 0.00877 Gy) 72 h post-

28

inoculation, dose (Gy, calculated as 1 r = 0.00877 Gy), 48 h pre-inoculation dose (Gy, calculated
as 1 r = 0.00877 Gy), start follow-up day (identically = 0), end follow-up day, death at end of
follow-up (0=no, 1=yes). This is reconstructed from Table 1 (p.479). For example the first row of
Table 1 suggests that there are 25 mice untreated (0 Gy), with cumulative mouse deaths of 2, 9,
13, 21, 22, 22, 22, 22 at 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 days, implying there are 3 mice surviving to at least
day 11 without dying, two mice dying at day 3, 7 mice dying on day 4, 4 mice dying on day 5, 8
mice on day 6, and a single mouse on day 7. We accordingly reconstructed individual animal
records for all 25 mice in this group, as shown in this Table. We continued in this way for all
elements of this Table. All information about doses at various times before or after inoculation
came from the text description above each row in the Table. There was information on 252
individual mice in this data.

Experiments with irradiation before inoculation
Beutler and Gezon [26]
From Table II (p.232) we constructed a Table for mortality from mouse-adapted virus with records
containing for each group of animals the experiment number, the suspension group, the negative
log viral dilution, the group number (an arbitrary number, which we took to start at 1 for the first
group, increasing by 1 for each successive group), the radiation dose (Gy, using 1 r = 0.00877 Gy),
the number of mice that died and the number exposed.
Likewise we constructed a similar table for morbidity from mouse-adapted virus, based on
Table III (p.233) with records containing for each group of animals the experiment number, the
suspension group, the negative log viral dilution, the group number (an arbitrary number, which
we took to start at 1 for the first group, increasing by 1 for each successive group), the radiation

29

dose (Gy, using 1 r = 0.00877 Gy), the number of mice with morbidity and the number in each
treatment group.
From Table V (p.237) we constructed a Table for mortality from egg-adapted virus with
records containing for each group of animals the experiment number, the negative log viral
dilution, the group number (an arbitrary number, which we took to start at 1 for the first group,
increasing by 1 for each successive group), the radiation dose (Gy, using 1 r = 0.00877 Gy), the
number of mice that died and the number in each treatment group.
Likewise from Table VI (p.237) we constructed a Table for morbidity from egg-adapted
virus with records containing for each group of animals the experiment number, the negative log
viral dilution, the group number (an arbitrary number, which we took to start at 1 for the first
group, increasing by 1 for each successive group), the radiation dose (Gy, using 1 r = 0.00877 Gy),
the number of mice with morbidity and the number in each treatment group.

Hale and Stoner [27]
From Table 1 (p.327) we produced a table with group number, number of mice, passively
immunized (yes, no), radiation dose (Gy, using 1 rep =0.00877 Gy), pneumococcus injected intraabdominally (yes, no), and number of deaths.

Hale and Stoner [28]
From Table I, II, III, V we produced a table with experiment (table), group, no of mice, 1st
immunizing infection type, radiation dosage (Gy, calculated as 1 rep = 0.00877 Gy), type of 2nd
challenge infection, days from first injection to second, deaths.

30

Quilligan et al [19]
We constructed a table from the text describing two series of experiments on p.509. “Another
experiment with small numbers was carried out in which the animals were exposed to the 110
r/day dose for 15 days. At this time, these animals, together with a control group, were given live
PR8 virus by the intraperitoneal route. Twelve days later, both groups of animals were challenged
with the same virus by the intranasal route. Seven of the eight irradiated animals died, whereas
there were no deaths in the nonirradiated vaccinated animals. A second experiment carried out in
the same way showed 4/6 deaths in the vaccinated irradiated group and 1/10 deaths in the
vaccinated nonirradiated group.” The numbers in the first control group are not given, but
presumably about 8 animals were used, our central estimate. As sensitivity analysis we also
assumed there to be either 6 or 10 animals in this first control group. Roentgen (r) are converted
to Gy via 1 r = 0.00877 Gy.

Berlin [9]
A table was constructed from Table I (p.865). The first table contained details on experiment,
radiation dose (Gy, calculated as 1 R = 0.00877 Gy), number with pneumonitis morbidity,
morbidity number at risk, number with pneumonitis mortality, and mortality number at risk.

Berlin and Cochran [10]
Separate tables were constructed from Table II (p.346) and Table III (p.347). The first table
contained data on dilution of virus inoculum, dose of X ray (Gy, calculated as 1 R = 0.00877 Gy),
number of mice, X-ray deaths, influenza morbidity, influenza mortality, mean survival time days.

31

The second table contained data on experiment number, route of viral exposure (intra-nasal, air),
days between X-ray and inoculation, number of sham exposure influenza deaths, number of sham
exposed mice, X-irradiated influenza deaths, number of X-irradiated mice, sham exposed days to
death, sham exposed days to death standard error (SE), X-ray exposed days to death, and X-ray
exposed days to death SE.

Lundgren et al [29]
We used Table I (p.240) to construct a table with weeks post

144

CeO2 inhalation, absorbed dose

(Gy, calculated as 1 rad = 0.01 Gy), SD dose (Gy, calculated as 1 rad = 0.01 Gy), mortality in
irradiated mice, number of irradiated mice, mortality in control mice, and numbers of control mice.
