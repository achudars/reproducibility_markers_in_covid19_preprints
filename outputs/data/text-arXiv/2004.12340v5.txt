Abstract
During the epidemics of COVID-19, the whole world is experiencing a serious crisis on public
health and economy. Understanding the human mobility during the pandemic helps one to design
intervention strategies and resilience measures. The widely used Bike Sharing System (BSS) can
characterize the activities of urban dwellers over time & space in big cities but is rarely reported in
epidemiological research. In this paper, we present a human mobility analyzing framework based
on BSS data, which examines the spatiotemporal characteristics of share bike users, detects the
key time nodes of different pandemic stages, and demonstrats the evolution of human mobility due
to the onset of the COVID-19 threat and administrative restrictions. We assessed the net impact
of the pandemic by using the result of co-location analysis between share bike usage and POIs
(Point Of Interest). Our results show the pandemic reduced the overall bike usage by 64.8%, then
an average increase (15.9%) in share bike usage appeared afterwards, suggesting that productive
and residential activities have partially recovered but far from the ordinary days. These findings
could be a reference for epidemiological researches and inform policymaking in the context of the
current COVID-19 outbreak and other epidemic events at city-scale.

Introduction

COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-COV-2,
which has now triggered a global pandemic1 . According to a situation report of WHO2 , the worldwide
total confirmed cases have reached 2,471,136 including 84,287 that of China as of 22 April 2020.
COVID-19 pandemic inflicts a huge impact on public health and most economic sectors, from the
beginning of Chinese New Year holiday till May 2020. Under the threat of the pandemic, productive
and social activities of residents were inevitably influenced [2, 25]. Measuring the changes in human
mobility dynamics is essential for transmission prediction, control measure design, and post-pandemic
recovery.
Current COVID-19-related epidemiological studies mainly focus on transmission dynamics [17, 22]
and preventive measures [3, 8, 24], from a local or global perspective [19, 29]. Nevertheless, few
studies investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics quantitatively during the pandemic. Ferguson et al.
[12] studied two main strategies of non-pharmaceutical interventions in infectious disease prevention:
suppression, case of China and South Korea, with enormous social and economic costs which may
cause secondary disasters on health and well-being in short and longer-term; mitigation, case of Great

Britain and the United States, may not be able to protect residents at risk from severe diseases and
resulting in high mortality. Fang et al. [11] provided a causal interpretation of the impact of city
lockdown on human mobility and the spread of COVID-19 in China. Mollalo et al. [19] developed
nationwide geographic modeling of COVID-19 and investigated the county-level variations of COVID19 incidence across the United States. With the help of the mobile internet user data from Baidu
Mobility platform, Mu et al. [20] examined the interplay between disease spread of COVID-19 and
inter- & intra-city mobility in 319 Chinese cities. However, few studies focus on the dynamics of
human mobility at a local scale during a long-term pandemic.
Geospatial big data have great potential to improve disease surveillance and disaster response
[13, 14, 15, 30]. In this paper, we focus on the spatiotemporal changes in human mobility under
the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic at city-scale. Even though online surveys and mobile phone
positioning data could be referential [5, 26, 27], one can hardly distinguish purposive movements from
random wandering/indoor movements in these data. Moreover, they do not cover all the population
especially those who care about their privacy and are thus not willing to offer their precise location [18].
In addition, after the outbreak of COVID-19, social distancing and home quarantine, were imposed
for pandemics prevention. Also, there was a suspension of buses and taxis for a short time after the
outbreak, because they form a public enclosed space. These strict control measures inevitably narrowed
the options of public transit. For the above reasons, the wide-spread Bike Sharing System (BSS) in
China became an alternative to fulfill people’s need in short-distance transportation and it became a
data source to analyze human mobility at city-scale during the pandemic period.
Thanks to the rapid development of GIS- and IoT-based system, the 3rd-generation BSS (a.k.a freefloating/dockless BSS) emerges in China in 2015. Compared to its predecessors, the 3rd-generation
BSS (from now on referred to as BSS) is no longer constrained by docking stations. They are often
spread along roads and cover most of the urban residents. In the city of Beijing, for example, the
number of share bikes reached its peak in 2017 and the municipal government began removing excess
bike supply afterwards3 . After two years of rapid development and regulation, the demand and supply
of BSS reached a balance in 2019, which made it a stable data source.
BSS records contain OD (origin-destination) information and timestamps from anonymous users,
offering a promising alternative data source revealing the spatial and temporal information of outdoor
activities of residents. According to Daxue Consulting4 , in Beijing, 93% of travels less than 5 km are
quicker done by bike and public transport than by car. Chen et al. [7] stated that approximately half of
the population in Beijing were registered as dockless bike share members in 2017, suggesting that this
large user base and the easy access to share bikes have made BSS data suitable for characterization of
human mobility. Du et al. [9] studied the travel patterns of BSS in Nanjing via limited questionnaires.
Xu et al. [28] characterized the temporal flow and spatial distribution of share bikes in Singapore.
Kaggle organized a competition of predicting share bike demands5 based on limited entries. There are
also studies focusing on BSS rebalancing strategies [1, 6, 21]. However, the use of BSS data in the
studies of pandemic response is still at its early stages.
To address the lack of understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of city-scale human mobility
influenced by COVID-19 pandemic, we put up the following objectives:
1. Determining the pandemic period and measuring period-wise changes in human mobility;
2. Assessing the net pandemic impact and the rehabilitation progress.
We achieved these objectives by constructing a human mobility analyzing framework. It managed
to demonstrate spatiotemporal patterns intuitively and computationally.
• The intuitional part helps one to understand quickly the situation by showing the timeline,
different phases of the whole pandemic, and basic statistics of POI categories revealing roughly
the severity of the pandemic.
• The computational part gives a more quantitative vision. We first divided the study period (i.e.,
Jan, 2020 to Mar, 2020) into several pandemic periods via a k-segmentation approach, which inferred the epidemic stages based on temporal characteristics of human mobility from BSS dataset.

Afterward, we assessed the net impact of the COVID-19 pandemic via a DID (Difference-InDifferences) model with the long-time-sequenced BSS data dating from 2019. Among numerous
candidate explanatory variables, we removed the effect of the Chinese New Year and weather
factor and quantified the impact of the epidemic on human mobility. Finally, in different pandemic periods, we implemented a co-location analysis between the share bike usage and different
types of POIs, which demonstrated the evolution of mobility due to the onset of the COVID-19
threat and assessed the rehabilitation progress corresponding to different urban functions.
The main novelty of our work is: quantifying and assessing the net impact of COVID-19 pandemic
on general cities (outside the outbreak zone) from spatiotemporal perspective via the human mobility
extracted from long-time-sequenced share bikes records. As far as we know, no previous study has
investigated the impact of epidemics based on BSS data. The results are at city-level, which could
provide fine-scaled references for policymaking and epidemiological researches.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 & 3 describe the study area and research
methods. Section 4 reports the spatiotemporal characteristics of the share bike usage and shows DID
results. Section 5 presents a co-location analysis with POIs, which quantifies the pandemic influence
and degree of rehabilitation towards different urban functions. Section 6 concludes with some remarks
and Section 7 states the outline of our future research.

Study Area

This study was conducted in the city of Beijing, the capital of China. As shown in Figure 1, Beijing is
located at the North China Plain, occupying an area of 16,411 km2 (39.4°-41.6°N, 115.7°-117.4°E). In
2019, the municipal population of Beijing has reached 21.53 million. The cumulative total COVID-19
confirmed cases in Beijing has reached 418 by 05 Mar, 20206 . As a metropolis with a huge population
of immigrants, Beijing has taken measures in response to the outbreak, such as holiday extension,
executive orders like “stay at home” and “working from home”. Under this circumstance, the human
mobility was influenced, showing spatiotemporal patterns different from ordinary days.

2.2

Data Sets

Four data sets were used in our study: BSS records, Points Of Interest (POIs), confirmed COVID-19
cases, and weather records.
1. BSS records
This OD dataset came from 1.02 million share bikes belonging to 4 main BSS operators (Mobike,
DiDi Bike, Hellobike, and Ofo) in Beijing. The records date from Mar, 2019 to Mar, 2020 (66.8
GB) and cover 1.5 million uses per day contributed by 11 million users, which account for half of
the total population of Beijing. They were created when users locked/unlocked their share bikes,
excluding that of rebalancing operations. This exclusion guarantees that the records come purely
from users. Moreover, the BSS data is anonymous, which does not cause privacy concerns. It
should be noted that the BSS records in certain districts (Chaoyang, Fengtai and Shijingshan)
are not available due to different policies of local governments.
2. Points Of Interest (POIs)
POIs of Beijing are collected from AutoNavi API provided by Gaode Maps7 , one of the most
popular web mapping platforms in China. Each entry has a unique POI ID object id, an
address including longitude/latitude information, and a three-level category large category,
mid category and sub category. Among hundreds of categories, we chose seven mid ones: residential area (RA), high-tech company (HC), other company (OC), subway station (SS), shopping
plaza (SP), supermarket (SM) and tertiary hospitals (TH)8 , as HC and OC reflect productive
activities, SP, SM, TH reflects social activities, and RA, SS reflect both activities.

3. Confirmed COVID-19 Cases
The cumulative daily counts of clinically diagnosed cases in each district from 20 Jan, to 05 Mar,
2020 were collected from the daily update on the COVID-19 outbreak dashboard provided by
Foreign Affairs Office of the People’s Government of Beijing Municipality9 . We picked out a total
of 87 infected residential areas (see Figure 1). According to the timeline [17] of the outbreak, we
visualized the evolution of the overall pandemic situation of Beijing in Figure 2.
4. Weather data
Weather data came from China Meteorological Data Service Center10 , containing daily weather
information such as temperature, wind speed, and precipitation, dating from 01 Jan, to 05 Mar
of 2019 and 2020.

Tools and Methodology

3.1

Tools

To deal with large-scale spatial queries on the huge BSS dataset (66.8 GB), we need to apply parallel
computing all along this study:
1. HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)11 : a distributed file system which is suitable for parallel
computing.
2. Spark12 : a parallel analytic engine for big data, and can invoke SQL to process temporal queries
in BSS data, performing denoising and statistical analysis.
3. GeoSpark [16]: a GIS-based engine based on Spark, capable of performing spatial analysis and
visualization of geo-based data.
Python is our primary programming language, and cartographic visualization is done by ESRI
ArcGIS 10.713 . All computation in this paper was run on a computer cluster consisting of 7 machines
with Intel®Xeon®, CPU E5-2640 v2 @2.00 GHz, 8 cores, 61.7 GB RAM, 20 MB cache.

3.2

Methodology

This study aims at analyzing quantitatively the impacts of COVID-19 on Beijing from spatiotemporal
perspective via the human mobility extracted from long-time-sequenced BSS data. Figure 3 shows the
workflow of human mobility analyzing framework. In the Preprocessing block, BSS data and other
data sets were stored in a spatial database and denoised before use. Certain POI types were clustered
using DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm [10], as they
may be located close to each other, causing duplicate patterns in further analysis.
In the Analysis block, there are mainly five tasks:
1. Statistical charts: a first-step visualization of the statistics of share bike data;
2. Phase segmentation: using k-segmentation approach to divide the whole study period into logical
phases, i.e., pandemic phases;
3. Co-location analysis: measuring share bike usage near different POIs in different phases;
4. Heatmap: visualization of the share bike data in the aspect of space + time;
5. DID (Difference-In-Differences): quantitative analysis of the share bike data.

3.3

Data Preprocessing

Our raw datasets need preprossessing to fit further analysis. We first removed the outliers, e.g. bikes
“in the water”, temperature of 999 ℃... We also had to deal with the duplicate positions. HC, and
OC are of high spatial density because multiple companies may co-locate in the same/adjacent office
building. To avoid repeated counting of POI-bike co-located pairs, we used POI clusters for these three
categories instead. We clustered nearby POIs using DBSCAN algorithm, which has three merits:
• No need to specify the number of clusters;
• Allowing clusters of all forms and sizes;
• Dealing with noise and outliers.

Figure 3: Workflow of the human mobility analyzing framework. After clustering and denoising the raw
data, the main process walks into two branches, spatial analysis and statistical analysis with the help
of parallel computing tools. Spatial analysis contains a first-step co-location analysis, giving results to
ArcGIS for visualization and to DID for quantitative analysis. The branch of statistical analysis also
runs with the visual + numerical logic: statistical charts for visualization and phase segmentation for
quantitative analysis. We then combine the results of the two branches and reach the final conclusion.
We configured the DBSCAN parameter as follows: ε = 100 m, the maximum distance between two
samples and min samples = 10, the number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered
as a core point of a cluster.
Among the seven chosen POI categories, RA is the only “area of interest” (not “point of interest”).
The records of RA contain not only their geometric centers but also their contours which is a key
factor of further results. To solve such problem and unify the input of the whole procedure, we used
the buffer zones of POIs to replace the original POIs in the co-location analysis.

3.4

Co-location Analysis

Co-location analysis depicts the co-location patterns of share bike usage with adjacent urban functions.
We proceeded share bike data and POIs with GeoSpark, which performs spatial queries via parallel
computing on Spark. Among numerous spatial queries, we utilized spatial join(geom1, geom2),
which queries if object geom1 is inside geom2 and distance join(geom1, geom2, dist) which queries
if the distance of geom1 and geom2 is less than dist. As these queries are partition-independent except
for the points near the borders of partitions, the parallel portion is high if the data are well indexed.

3.5

Phase Classification

Generally, the evolution of an epidemic can be empirically divided into several stages according to the
timeline of the outbreak. Apart from empirical division, we segmented the study period (two months)
in a more logical way with a phase classification strategy based on temporal characteristics of human
mobility from BSS dataset. In machine learning tasks, one often aims at minimizing the predefined

6

loss function to perform the best classification such that elements within the same cluster are similar,
and elements across clusters are different. Likewise, we tried to segment the study period into phases
with the most resembling patterns using k-segmentation.
Definition 1 (k-segmentation). Let X = {x1 , x2 , . . . , xN } be a time series of length N . Given k ∈ N,
k < N and index set T = {n0 , . . . , nk } with n0 = 0, nk = N and ∀i, ni < ni+1 , a k-segmentation of
X is the set of time series Xi = {xni +1 , . . . , xni+1 } where 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1.
Pk
To evaluate a k-segmentation, we use σ = i=1 σi as the loss function where σi is the standard
deviation of division Xi . The goal is to find the best T to minimize σ, i.e., arg minT σ(T). This
problem can be solved at the complexity level of O(N 2 k) [23]. In case k and N are small, the optimum
can be found via exhaustive search.

3.6

Difference-In-Differences (DID)

Usually, it is difficult to find and quantify all the factors of a certain event. DID is a techinique
which tries to mimic an experimental research design using observational study data by constructing a
“treatment group” and a “control group”, under the assumption of “common trend” (the two groups
will follow the same trend if no treatment is done) [4]. The treatment (effect) can be extracted because
all the effect of common factors are included in the “common trend”. We applied DID to distinguish
the impact of epidemic effect from other effects, e.g., the effect of Chinese New Year. Table 1 shows
the configuration of the DID analysis. Assume we have a “virtual pandemic” just after Chinese New
Year of 2019, we set T and D as binary variables, with T indicating whether the year is 2020, and
D indicating whether the study period is during the pandemic. The “real” pandemic is present only
when T = 1 and D = 1.

Table 1: DID configuration.
By including BSS dataset of 2019 as a control, the DID regression function is as follows:
log(Ut ) = α + β1 · Before2020 ,t + β2 · During2020 ,t + θt + εt

(1)

where t is the date, Ut is the share bike usage on date t. Before2020 ,t and During2020 ,t are dummy
variables. Before2020 ,t = 1 if t is 4 to 11 days before the outbreak of pandemic. This term is set to
verify the common trend assumption in DID analysis. During2020 ,t = 1 when t is during the pandemic
or in mitigation period (corresponding to T × D in Table 1). α is a constant term, β1 , β2 are fitted
coefficients, θt is the date fixed effects (weather, temperature, weekday/weekend, Chinese New Year,
etc.), and εt is the residual term. The effect of holiday and pandemic can be evaluated by β1 and β2 .

Results
Temporal Characteristics of Share Bike Usage

We chose several time points from WHO statements14 as shown in Table 2. These important dates
could track the virus transmission in Beijing:
As the outbreak of COVID-19 coincided with the Chinese New Year holiday 2020, we used the
Chinese New Year holiday of 2019 as a comparison to assess the influence of this period on share bike
usage. It is worth noticing that the Chinese New Year holiday of 2019 and 2020 are not equal-length,
because that of 2020 was extended by executive orders. We compared the share bike usage on rush
hours (8:00-09:00) during 64 days from 01 Jan to 02 Mar, 2019 and 01 Jan to 01 Mar, 2020 respectively
(data of 29 Feb and 01 Mar, 2020 were brought backward by one day due to the leap year 2020). We
chose rush hours because this time interval corresponds to the highest bike usage frequency of the day

and it reflects productive activities. Figure 4 illustrates temporal evolution of share bike usage during
the selected periods of 2019 and 2020 (POI-wise graphs are in Figure 9 of Appendix B).
As shown in Figure 4, share bike usage sharply dropped when the Chinese New Year holiday started.
During these periods, schools and workplaces were closed. In 2020, the overall closure was forced to
be extended to mitigate the pandemic.
The share bike usage on rush hours exhibits a periodicity in productive activities: high on weekdays
and low on weekends, which fits our general knowledge. However, this pattern does not match the
week of 10 Feb, 2020 when the government declared the partial restart of certain productive and social
activities. This anomaly suggests that the activities were not resumed at least until 17 Feb, one week
after the partial restart, corresponding to the fact that the impact of the pandemic was lasting till the
end of our study period.
Remark: In this paper, we assume that share bike usage follows normal distribution, whose 95%
confidence interval is [x̄ − 2σ, x̄ + 2σ], and data are presented in the form x̄ ± 2σ.
Table 3 gives a statistical view of aggregated bike usages during different time-intervals. The upper
part shows that on the rush hours of ordinary days, the share bike usage in 2020 is of the same order
of magnitude as that of 2019, suggesting that share bike demand follows common trends. However,
the lower part shows the case of the Chinese New Year holiday, where the overall share bike usage
dropped to less than 40% compared with the same period in 2019, suggesting more companies stopped
working due to the Chinese New Year holiday in 2020.
However, the dates in Table 2 may not be a proper segmemtation, as there is no noticeable share
bike usage change after 10 Feb. We obtained a time series by computing the share bike usage within 100
m of each POI every day from 02 Jan to 02 Mar, 2020. Then we segmented the time series into three
phases in accordance with k-segmentation (Definition 1 in Section 3.5). We found the best-classified

We also noticed a minor difference between the share bikes around HC,OC and that of others.
This difference can be explained by the lag between the end of work and the start of vacation. Social
and productive activities were not resumed until 24 Feb, two weeks after the official declaration of the

Spatiotemporal Evolution of Share Bike Usage

In this section, we first demonstrated the spatiotemporal change in share bike usage during the pandemic. Furthermore, a comparison of share bikes usage between 2019 and 2020 was conducted to show
the influence of the pandemic roughly in different phases. To evaluate its net impact, we applied DID
method to remove the influence of other factors, e.g., Chinese New Year, weather and common trend
of BSS data.
4.2.1

Evolution in 2020

Figure 5 shows the evolution of BSS activities during a 4-day interval from 21 Jan to 2 Mar. The trend
of human mobility are consistent with Figure 4.
Before 21 Jan, 2020, share bike activities were spread throughout the city limits, with a significant
concentration in the downtown area (up to 500-1000 records/hour). This pattern indicates the spatial
distribution of human mobility before the COVID-19 outbreak.
After the outbreak, there was a dramatic drop in mobility since 25 Jan, which was also the beginning
of the Chinese New Year holiday. Figure 5(b)-5(e) ranging from 25 Jan to 06 Feb are dominated by low
intensity, indicating non-essential trips has dropped significantly due to combined effects of holidays
and the epidemic. This situation continued until 09 Feb, when the spread of COVID-19 slowed down
and productive and social activities were allowed to restart partially.
Figure 5(f)-5(k) show a gradual increase in the mobility from 10 Feb to 01 Mar, 2020. However,
the human mobility only restored around 30% of the pre-pandemic level. It is worth noticing that
only slight differences could be observed between the weekdays and the weekends before 17 Feb and
the weekday-weekend oscillation reappeared afterward. There was a higher demand for share bikes on
workdays in downtown area than the outbreak phase. However, this high-demand shrank on weekends,
implying the residents were more inclined to reduce the risk of increased exposure by going outside
under the threat of COVID-19.

green to red.
4.2.2

Comparison between 2019 and 2020

However, both the Chinese New Year holiday shutdown and pandemic can result in the mobility
decrease. Hence, we compared the share bike usage between 2020 and that of 2019 in the same period.
This procedure roughly removed the impact of the Chinese New Year holiday and reflected the influence
of the pandemic in the whole study area.
Figure 6 delineates the sum of aggregated share bike usage in phase a, b, c of 2020 (row 1), the
share bike usage in the corresponding period of 2019 (row 2), and the difference of the former two
results (row 3). Figure 6(d) summarizes the average share bike usage intensity during the same time
interval as phase a in 2019, showing similar spatial patterns as in 2020.
The significant discrepancies in share bike usage between 2019 and 2020 during phase b and phase
c are considered the consequence of the pandemic of COVID-19. According to Figure 6(e), the human
mobility decreased due to Chinese New Year in 2019 and high intensity remained in certain areas.
However, the human mobility was in a state of complete suppression in 2020. The difference map in
Figure 6(h) suggests that under the impact of COVID-19, trips were reduced for safety purposes.
Figure 6(f) indicates that the mobility would instantly return to pre-festival levels or more widespread as a result of the influx of migrant employees after the holiday in 2019. According to Figure 6(c),
the rehabilitation was in progress, but much slower during the epidemic mitigated period. The remarkable difference inferred from Figure 6(i) verifies this sustained impact.

Estimation of Pandemic Impact via DID Analysis

We applied DID (Difference-In-Differences) technique to quantify the impact of the pandemic by removing the influence of the Chinese New Year, weather factors, and the common trend of share bike
use. We combined phase b and c in our DID model because the pandemic lasted at least to the end
of our study period.
Equation (1) in Section 3.6 was applied to fit the share bike usage and weather data in 62 days from
01 Jan of 2019 and 2020, respectively. We use the year 2020 as the treatment group and 2019 as the
control group (no pandemic). Before2020 ,t = 1 if t is between Jan 1 to Jan 10, 2020. During2020 ,t = 1
if t is in phase b or c. The date range for Before2020 ,t = 1 is set to be unequal to phase a to avoid
multi-collinearity problem. Otherwise, as the two variables cover all the study period, Before2020 ,t =
1 − After2020 ,t , they are linearly dependent, which cripples DID analysis.
Table 5 shows the regression result of Equation (1). We ignored the constant term α in the whole
analysis because we are more interested in the change of the share bike usage which reflects the human
mobility of citizens. |β1 | is small enough, suggesting that the effects of Chinese New Year and that of
the share bike usage trend are well absorbed by θ. β2 is negative and statistically significant, suggesting
that the pandemic reduced the human mobility when compared to 2019. We estimated the percentage
of share bike usage decrease due to the net impact of the pandemic via 1 − exp(β2 ) (see Appendix A).

Table 5: The net effects of COVID-19 on share bike usage obtained via DID, with all the value of
During2020 (β2 ) at 5% significance level. The result is in the form of x̄(σ)
According to Table 5, we found the coefficient β2 for all the POI categories to be -1.044, which implied
that the pandemic reduces the overall bike usage by 64.8%. This percentage is slightly lower than
69.49% estimated for Wuhan (the outbreak zone), as reported by Fang et al. [11]. Mu et al. [20]
estimated the intra-city mobility reduction in Beijing between 56.5% and 65.2%, which is consistent
with our result (64.8%).
The same analysis was conducted with the seven POI categories. With all β2 values at a 5%
significance level, we considered the COVID-19 has a negative impact on mobility close/belonging
to these types of urban functional areas. The main reason could be attributed to the quarantine
restrictions. The estimated mobility reduction due to the pandemic of SS (77.91%), HC (74.21%), and
SP (73.58%) are higher than that of other categories.

5

Co-location Analysis between Share Bike Usage and POIs

To further explain the difference in the estimated mobility reduction of various urban functions above,
we consequently studied the relationships between the locations of different types of POIs and adjacent
share bike usage with co-location analysis.

5.1

Mapping POIs with Share Bikes

Figure 7-8 take 16 Jan, 15 Feb, and 02 Mar as the profiles of phase a, b, c, showing the position
of our selected POI categories and the share bike usage in different pandemic phases. We selected SS
and RA as typical POI categories for the following reasons:
• Share bikes fulfill the trip of “first/last 1 km to/from subways” in ordinary days.
• However, during the pandemic, the flow of public transit was strictly limited and people were
afraid of being infected, which may cause a drastical decrease in subway usage.
• Moreover, to suppress disease transmission, intervention strategies including work restriction,
home quarantine, and facility closure were imposed and kept people staying at home, resulting
in mobility gathering around residential areas.

Figure 8: Share bikes and residential areas (RAs).
As shown in Figure 7, SS were always surrounded by massive share bikes. Although a drastic
decrease in share bike usage can be observed during the quarantine period, some share bike usage
remained around subway stations, which is consistent with Table 6. According to figures corresponding
to 02 Mar, the mobility started to recover after the pandemic was mitigated. As can be seen in Figure 8,
the infected RAs (IRAs) were mostly situated in the city center on 16 Jan. On 15 Feb, the share bike
usage around these IRAs was limited. On 02 Mar, share bike usage has recovered nearly uniformly in
the whole city, including IRAs and their surrounding areas.
To confirm the above observation, we performed a categorized co-location analysis with POIs as
follows.

5.2

Estimating Pandemic Imapct and Rehabilitation Progress with Categorized Co-location Analysis

As different POI categories may co-locate with each other, e.g. RA and SM. To distinguish the type
of share bike usage, we study the critical time slots, i.e., the main share bike use of each POI category.
For instance, we selected 8:00-10:00 as the critical time slot for HC and OC.
Table 6 shows the share bike usage per day of around each POI category with displacement of less
than 100 m during its critical time slot, where the first three rows are cluster-based co-location, and
the rest are point-based co-location. Ua , Ub , Uc stand for the share bike usage during phase a, b, c.
Two associated ratios measure the extent to which the COVID-19 epidemic has led: Ub /Ua quantifies
the decline in share bike usage during the Chinese New Year, which coincides with the quarantine
period; Uc /Ua reflects the recovery progress (% of pre-pandemic).

Table 6: Bike usage in phase a, b, c around the chosen POIs, shown in the form of x̄ ± 2σ (see
abbreviations in Section 2.2).
Ub /Ua shows that the bike usage of all categories decreased to one quarter of that before the
pandemic, and HC dropped the most in both values (from 4.06 to 0.42) and proportion (10.4%).
One possible explanation is that the staff in HC suit best “work from home”. During this period,
the intensive intra-city public traffic (e.g., buses) was restricted to avoid contact infection, and share
bikes is almost the only approach to fulfill short-term travel demand under this situation. Ub /Ua of

13

SM (25.2%), TH (24.7%) and RA (24.2%) are higher than that in other categories. One possible
explanation is: for residents, the need for essential goods (e.g., food, medicine) cannot be reduced,
even though outdoor activities were voluntarily reduced during the quarantine.
Uc /Ua shows that after the partial restart of productive and social activities, the bike usage of all
categories has recovered to some extent but far from the situation of usual time. The average increase
of the seven chosen categories is 15.9% compared to phase b. Partial restart led to a slight increase
in the daily average share bike usage near HC and OC. Uc /Ua being 28.6% for HC and 30.4% for OC
suggests that there is still a long way from full recovery. During the mitigation period, SM has the
highest recovery level, with the Uc /Ua up to 46.1%, because it served as the main subsistence suppliers.
In conclusion, HC and OC were greatly impacted because the beginning of the pandemic coincides
with the Chinese New Year and people stopped working. SS was influenced to the same degree due to
travel limitations and the fear of COVID-19.
Even if people had already stored sufficient supplies (usually the food storage for one week or
longer) to prepare for the Chinese New Year, they were running out of storage and had to procure
their necessities. Thus, RA, SM were less impacted after one week of strict quarantine. SP was more
influenced than RA and SM because the goods provided by SP are mainly not necessities. TH has the
smallest Uc /Ua − Ub /Ua value among the POIs, suggesting THs were providing continuous services to
the public during the pandemic.
In Figure 1, we noticed that being the center of Beijing, Dongcheng and Xicheng district contained
most of the IRAs, and the confirmed time lies between 05 and 12 Feb. We carried out the same analysis
on the sub-categories of RAs to assess the impact of confirmed cases, with results in Table 7. The
IRAs and surrounding RAs (SRA, the RAs surrounding IRAs) are surprisingly not the most affected
category, implying that residents were indifferently in panic, and limited their travel purpose to their
basic needs. According to the ratio Uc /Ua , the share bike usage of IRAs (39.9%) and their SRAs
(39.0%) have recovered roughly to the same level compared to other RAs (39.0%) from the pandemic.

Conclusion

The wide-spread BSS is an alternative data source for characterizing the spatial and temporal details of
the human mobility. This paper introduces a human mobility analyzing framework aiming at extracting
and analyzing the impact of the pandemic on the human mobility and the rehabilitation process at
city-scale. The results reveal the period-wise spatiotemporal characteristics and co-location patterns
of human mobility presented by share bike usage before & during the pandemic in Beijing, China.
Based on our analysis, we make the following conclusions:
1. Apart from the timeline of the outbreak, we identified two key time nodes: 23 Jan and 24 Feb,
and segmented the study period (two months) into three pandemic phases: phase a before the
pandemic, phase b during pandemic, phase c when pandemic mitigated.
2. We used DID model to assess quantitatively the net impact of the pandemic on various aspects
of daily life. The simple but effective configuration (we considered only pandemic weather, and
holidays) suggests the effect of the pandemic is important enough to overwhelm other candidate
factors. After removing the factors of the Chinese New Year holiday and weather, our results
confirmed that the activities of residents were hugely affected by the COVID-19, reflected in the
drastic decrease of share bike usage by 64.8%. Reductions in mobility close to Subway Station
(77.91%), High-tech Company (74.21%), and Shopping Plaza (73.58%) are higher than other
POI categories, which could be attributed to quarantine restrictions and “work from home”.
14

Residential areas, supermarkets, tertiary hospitals were less impacted as people have basic food
supplies and health care needs.
3. As the pandemic mitigated, an increase in human mobility was observed since 24 Feb. The
rehabilitation progress was assessed by a category-wise co-location analysis. The average increase
of share bike usage among the seven chosen POIs categories is 15.9%, suggesting that the mobility
belonging to these types of functional areas has recovered to some extent but far from the situation
of usual time after the partial restart. The increase of 18.2% for High-tech Company and 17.6%
for Ordinary Company are higher than other categories.
4. In addition, our results imply that the infected Residential Areas and other Residential Areas
are not the most affected POI categories, and these two categories have recovered roughly to the
same level (about 39.0%) from the pandemic.
The present case study was implemented in Beijing, a typical metropolis affected by COVID-19
other than the epidemic center. As the situation develops globally, our results could be a generalized reference to epidemiological research and policymaking in the context of the current COVID-19
outbreak and be helpful for pandemic emergency response in the future.

Future Work

Since the municipal government implemented multiple interventions simultaneously or in a short timeframe to control the outbreak, the effect of individual strategies could not be evaluated. The multidimensional principal component analysis might be helpful in extracting the modes contributed by
each preventive measure.
Also, our current work has extracted the features of mobility from BSS and POI. Another possible
extension is to build a dynamic model based on the features predicting the share bike usage and
potential social event/reaction of the public during the pandemic or emergencies.

Calculation of Net Pandemic Effect

From Equation 1, in the pandemic phase, Before 2020 = 0, During 2020 = 1, we have
U = exp(α + θt + t ) · exp(β2 )
Let exp(α + θt + t ) = C, we have U = C · exp(β2 ). The proportion of share bike usage reduction
done by pandemic effect is
C −U
= 1 − exp(β2 )
