Abstract
As the major target of many vaccines and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV2, the spike (S) protein is observed to mutate over time. In this paper, we present statistical
approaches to tackle some challenges associated with the analysis of S-protein data. We build a
Bayesian hierarchical model to study the temporal and spatial evolution of S-protein sequences,
after grouping the sequences into representative clusters. We then apply sampling methods to
investigate possible changes to the S-protein’s 3-D structure as a result of commonly observed
mutations. While the increasing spread of D614G variants has been noted in other research,
our results also show that the co-occurring mutations of D614G together with S477N or A222V
may spread even more rapidly, as quantified by our model estimates.

Introduction

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a strain of novel coronavirus
that caused the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has quickly spread across
the world and has been characterized as a global pandemic (Zhou et al., 2020a; Wu et al., 2020).
As of December 19, 2020, there have been over 74 million probable or confirmed cases of COVID19, and the illness has been associated with 1.66 million deaths around the world (WHO, 2020a).
The development of vaccines and antibody-based therapeutic agents has been initiated since the
beginning of the pandemic and several have moved into phase III trials (Krammer, 2020; WHO,
2020b). Results concerning the long-term immunogenicity and efficacy of these vaccine candidates
are a subject of continued research. Meanwhile, the virus has been found to mutate in humanto-human transmissions over time, and these changes can potentially alter the efficacy of these
interventions. Therefore, it is also of vital importance to identify and study mutations with possible
fitness advantages and increased infectiousness.
SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus, and RNA viruses are known to have high mutation
rates and genetic diversity compared to DNA viruses (Duffy, 2018; Lauring and Andino, 2010).
Their ability to evolve underlies why they can adapt to novel hosts and develop resistance to either

vaccine or infection-induced immunity. Often, the most consequential mutations in terms of viral
functions and resistance to neutralizing antibodies are those that alter the surface proteins of the
virus. For instance, the mutation A82V in the Ebola virus glycoprotein was confirmed to have
enhanced infectivity and increased the severity of the EVD epidemic (Diehl et al., 2016). Further,
co-occurring mutations of A143V and R148K in the influenza H7N9 surface protein led to a 10-fold
reduction in its sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies (Ning et al., 2019). As a result, mutations in
the SARS-CoV-2 genome are being continuously monitored over time, and a major public repository
for sequenced genomes is GISAID (https://gisaid.org). In addition to collecting viral genome
data, GISAID also provides tools for visualizing the spread of various mutations, organized into
phylogenetic clusters (also known as clades) over space and time.
Four structural proteins – spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) – are
the building blocks for the SARS-CoV-2 virus particle (Phan, 2020). Out of these four proteins, the
S-protein plays the most critical role in attachment and entry into host cells, through its binding
with the human ACE2 receptor (Wan et al., 2020). For this reason, the S-protein is the major
target of many vaccines and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (Amanat and Krammer,
2020). In the event of infection, these antibodies can disrupt the spike protein’s ability to bind with
the ACE2 receptor, thereby blocking its entry into host cells. The analyses in this paper focus on
mutations in the amino acid sequence of the S-protein due to its particular importance.
Among all currently known S-protein sequence variants resulting from mutations in the underlying genome, D614G has been the most extensively studied due to its relatively early emergence
and subsequent prevalence. The notation “D614G” means that the amino acid D (aspartic acid) in
position 614 of the original (or reference) sequence has mutated to G (glycine), where the letters
are used to denote the 20 different amino acid types. A rapid increase in D614G was observed in
many regions after its initial appearance, which suggested fitness advantages and the hypothesis
that variants with D614G are likely more infectious (Korber et al., 2020). This was later corroborated by experimental evidence that D614G, either by itself or in conjunction with other mutations,
is significantly more infectious than the reference S-protein sequence (Li et al., 2020). Overall, the
continued evolution of the virus has resulted in thousands of distinct S-protein sequence variants
recorded in GISAID, although many of these only differ by a few mutated sequence positions. While
clinical or laboratory experiments can test the infectivity of specific mutations, it is challenging to
analyze large numbers of sequence variants.
Computational researchers have thus used clustering as a means to gain interpretable insight
into the effect of S-protein mutations across different geographical regions. Temporal changes in
the prevalence of S-protein mutations have also been studied in related research. For instance,
Chen et al. (2020b) clustered mutations occurring in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the
S-protein and studied binding affinity changes for each cluster. Based on common amino acid
mutations, Toyoshima et al. (2020) classified 28 countries into three clusters and studied correlations between fatality rate and S-protein D614G variants. In addition, the hypotheses of monotonic trends for D614G and various other mutations have been tested using isotonic regression
by Korber et al. (2020) and in the COVID-19 pipelines of the Los Alamos National Laboratory
(https://cov.lanl.gov). However, to the best of our knowledge, few authors have built comprehensive statistical models for the evolution of S-protein mutant clusters (i.e., groups of closely
related sequence variants) over space and time. Such models can have an important practical value
in providing forecasts and early warnings for countries where S-protein sequence variants with potential fitness advantages or higher infectiousness are actively being transmitted. To that end, this
paper presents one such Bayesian hierarchical model for multinomial time series that can help tackle
this problem.

The 3-D structure of a protein corresponding to its amino acid sequence is a crucial part of the
puzzle for understanding how the protein functions; thus, of particular interest here is the 3-D structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein and its mutated variants. Often, sequence mutations associated
with changes in viral infectivity can be attributed to changes in protein structure (Schaefer and
Rost, 2012). The first 3-D structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein was released in mid-February
2020 (Wrapp et al., 2020), and since then many other S-protein structures have been added to the
publicly available Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Bernstein et al., 1977). However, laboratory experiments to determine protein structure are laborious and costly, and ultimately some prove to be
intractable. For this reason, the structural impacts of common S-protein mutations are not yet welldocumented in the PDB, and computational methods are needed to predict their impact. Different
tools for 3-D protein structures have been used for this purpose thus far, including protein-protein
binding affinity prediction (Chen et al., 2020b), comparative modeling with known PDB structures
(Sedova et al., 2020), and Monte Carlo sampling of protein segments (Wong, 2020). In this paper we
follow the illustrative analysis in Wong (2020), applying similar statistical sampling approaches to
assess the potential local structural changes to the S-protein for common mutations in the current
mutant clusters considered.
Overall then, our goal in this paper to illustrate statistical ideas for tackling the aforementioned
challenges associated with the analysis of S-protein data, both their sequence and structure aspects.
Specifically based on presently available data, we study temporal and spatial changes in the mutations of S-protein sequences and their structural impact, with the aim to better understand the
ongoing evolution of the disease. Our contribution can be summarized in three parts. First, we
develop a Bayesian hierarchical model to study the evolution of mutant clusters. Second, we apply
sampling methods to analyze the local structural changes of the most frequently occurring protein
sequence mutations in these clusters. Third, we discuss our findings and relate them to other recent
work reported in the literature.

Data description and exploratory analysis
Sequence dataset

The S-protein sequence dataset for SARS-CoV-2 was obtained from GISAID on Oct 14th, 2020,
with the number of sequences totaling 98,699 after incomplete sequences were removed. The full
S-protein, based on the first discovered reference sequence, is 1273 amino acids long. Out of all complete sequences, 3,205 of them are unique, indicating that viral evolution has resulted in substantial
genetic diversity. Our analysis of complete sequences shows that D614G is the most frequent mutation, appearing in 86.5% of recorded sequences, followed by S477N (6.3%), A222V (3.6%), L18F
(1.9%), and L5F (0.99%), R21I (0.98%), and D936Y (0.74%). Many of these mutations are also
mentioned in the recent literature where mutation analysis was considered (Korber et al., 2020;
Chen et al., 2020a; Hodcroft et al., 2020). The sequences from GISAID are indexed by country and
date of deposition, which allows us to conveniently group them for subsequent analysis. Sequences
are separately deposited by local laboratories, therefore sequence counts vary widely by country
and may not be well-correlated with actual case counts. Due to this concern, we instead focus on
the relative prevalence, i.e., proportions of counts, throughout this paper.
To analyze the large numbers of sequence variants, we first implemented hierarchical clustering
to group the unique sequences according to their similarities. The distance matrix for hierarchical
clusters was based on the number of pairwise mismatched letters and the Ward-D linkage criterion,
which creates groups such that variance is minimized within clusters (Ward, 1963). For our illus3

trative analysis, we chose to use a total of five clusters, which aims to achieve a balance between
separability of the different clusters and interpretability of the results. Table 1 shows the most
common mutations in each cluster and their frequencies, where it can be seen that these clusters
all have identifiable patterns. For example, D614G is dominant in cluster I and present in 89% of
sequences within that cluster, while cluster II has the lowest frequency of mutations, indicating that
it is composed of sequences with a high level of similarity to the original reference sequence. In clusters III, IV, and V, D614G frequently occurred together with L5F, S477N, A222V respectively, and
these paired mutations are observed in almost all sequences within those clusters, evidencing a high
probability for the co-occurrence of some common mutations. Evidence for these co-occurrences
can also be seen in Table 2, which displays the top three unique sequences in each cluster (as ranked
by frequency within that cluster) and their specific mutation positions.

Table 1: Relative frequencies of the most common mutations present in each cluster. The top 9
mutations in descending order and their corresponding relative frequencies are shown in the columns
for each of clusters I–V. For example, the D614G mutation is present in 89% of the sequences
belonging to cluster I.
We selected 9 countries from the GISAID database to study based on the larger numbers of
sequences deposited, which are United States (US), Canada (CA), United Kingdom (UK), Netherlands (NL), France (FR), Spain (SP), China (CN), India (IN), and Australia (AU). The pie charts
in Figure 1 show the composition of clusters for each country for sequences accumulated since the
outbreak. Countries with distinctly different compositions are China and Australia, where China
has the majority of its sequences from cluster II, and Australia has cluster IV as its major cluster.
Cluster I is the largest cluster for the rest of the countries, followed by cluster II, while cluster V
has a noticeable presence in Europe, especially the UK.
The composition of clusters also changes over time, and as examples we show the temporal trend
of the daily cluster counts (upper panels) and proportions (lower panels) for the United States (US)
and the United Kingdom (UK) in Figure 2. The graphs show a major difference between the US and
UK composition trends over time: cluster I in the UK peaked around May to July and cluster V saw
a surge since late August or early September, while cluster I remains dominant in the US. Similarly,
most European countries have cluster V surging during this period, which suggests the most common
mutations in cluster V, D614G and A222V, might be related to the rise of infections across Europe
during the late summer and early autumn of 2020 (Dong et al., 2020). In addition to this, the
majority of countries have cluster II proportions decreasing over time in direct correspondence to
the emergence of cluster I infections over time. It can be seen that the GISAID sequence counts in
the upper panels of Figure 2 vary widely over time and do not necessarily correspond well with the

Structure dataset

The 3-D structure data for the S-protein were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Bernstein et al., 1977). The first laboratory-determined of a standalone 3-D structure of the SARS-CoV-2
S-protein was contributed in mid-February 2020 by a team of scientists at UT Austin using cyro-EM
techniques (Wrapp et al., 2020), with PDB accession code 6VSB. Since then, many other groups
around the world have contributed to the effort of studying different aspects of the S-protein using
laboratory techniques. As of Oct 14th, 2020, there were 108 3-D structures publicly available in the
PDB associated with the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein: 40 of these considered the S-protein in isolation,
under different conformational states and sequence variants; 11 of these studied the structure of Sprotein when bound together with ACE2; the remaining 57 studied the structure of S-protein when
interacting with different potential antibodies. Of the 68 structures containing the S-protein bound
together with ACE2 or an antibody, 32 of these focused on a specific region of the S-protein, known
as the receptor binding domain (RBD), primarily to decipher the binding behaviour of the S-protein
to these molecules. Otherwise, for the majority of the structures (76 out of 108), experimenters
attempted to determine the structure for the full S-protein.
Together, the PDB reflects the current state of knowledge for the S-protein structure, including
the attempts made to assess possible neutralizing antibodies in the development of therapeutic
interventions. Overall, 3-D structure determination has not kept pace with genome sequencing:
among all the amino acid mutations listed in Table 1, only D614G has been studied in the laboratory.
Thus, we cannot leverage the PDB to ascertain the potential changes in the 3-D structure of the
S-protein as a result of those mutations. Even in the best consensus 3-D structure for the reference

Methods and models
Bayesian hierarchical model for mutant clusters of sequences

In this section we present a Bayesian hierarchical model for the observed sequence counts, by day
and country, in each of the five clusters identified via our exploratory analysis. In motivating the
model, we recall that the number of deposited GISAID sequences varies widely over time and by
country. Thus, it is sensible to focus inference on the fraction of sequences belonging to each cluster
(i.e., cluster proportions) in each country, as in compositional data analysis (Aitchison, 1982).
Also, while LOESS identified some temporal trends for these cluster proportions in each country, it
cannot be used for prediction or for comparing the overall growth rates of different clusters. Thus,
our model contains the following key features. First, it provides estimates of the cluster proportions
for each country on any given day. Second, it assumes a growth rate parameter for each cluster that
is common across all countries, through which differences in prevalence among the S-protein mutant
clusters can be quantified. Third, the temporal evolution of the cluster proportions is allowed to be
dependent across countries via correlated errors.
Denote the observed sequence counts by the vectors yit = (yit1 , . . . , yit5 ), where yitc is the
number of sequences observed in GISAID for country i = 1, . . . , K on day t ≥ 1 belonging to

where nit = 5c=1 yitc is the total number of GISAID sequences recorded for country i on day t, and
pit = (pit1 , . . . , pit5 ) is the vectorP
of probabilities representing the true underlying cluster proportions
for country i on day t such that 5c=1 pitc = 1. Thus the model assumes that the observed sequences
represent a random sample from the population of infected individuals in a country, with a reporting
delay uniformly at random over the commonly assumed 14 day incubation period for the virus (Lauer
et al., 2020). The sampling fraction (i.e., number of reported GISAID sequences out of the number
of infected individuals in the country) may vary over time, and this setup permits inference on pit in
a manner that accommodates that sampling variability. Prior to Jan 20th, 2020 (i.e., when t < 14
in the model), we simply
take the multinomial probability to be the average of the days modeled
P
thus far, namely 1t tj=1 pij .
We apply a log-ratio transformation on the cluster proportions, as commonly used in compositional data analysis (Aitchison, 1999). Treating cluster I as the baseline, we define

p̃it = p̃i,t−1 + α + it for t > 1

(1)

where α = (α2 , α3 , α4 , α5 ) is a vector of growth rate parameters for clusters II to V, and it =
(it2 , it3 , it4 , it5 ) represents a random noise vector with mean zero that governs daily fluctuations.
Note that when it = 0, equation (1) implies
pi,t−1,c exp(αc )
∝ pi,t−1,c exp(αc )
pitc = P5
c=1 pi,t−1,c exp(αc )
for c = 1, . . . , 5 with α1 defined to be 0, so that exp(α) can be interpreted as the multiplicative daily
growth rates of clusters II to V relative to cluster I, with the proportions normalized to sum to 1,
similar to a model recently used to study the prevalence of different flu strains (Huddleston et al.,
2020). The α are assumed to be the same for all countries, to reflect the intrinsic fitness of each
mutant cluster. Define 1:K,t,c = (1tc , . . . , Ktc ), namely the random noise vector on day t across
all K countries for cluster c, where c ∈ {2, 3, 4, 5}. Then we let 1:K,t,c ∼ NK (0, Σ) independently
for each day and cluster, where NK denotes a K-variate Normal distribution and Σ is a covariance
matrix. This formulation allows for spatial dependence in the sense that the noise term can be
correlated among countries; intuitively, if a certain cluster experiences faster than expected growth
in one country for a period of time, nearby or geographically linked countries may experience similar
changes. In practice, we could set Σ to be of block diagonal form, for example, with each block as
countries within the same continent, assuming correlations between different continents are likely
negligible. Overall, our model setup follows the general structure of Gaussian dynamic models for
multinomial time series described in Cargnoni et al. (1997).
We complete the model specification with the choice of priors. During the early outbreak period
from Dec 24th, 2019 to Jan 6th, 2020, a total of 40 sequences worldwide were deposited in GISAID,
with two that we would now classify to be in cluster I and 38 in cluster II. Thus we set a Dirichlet
prior for the cluster proportions in the model for the starting date of the model (Jan 7th, 2020),
pi1 ∼ Dirichlet(3, 39, 1, 1, 1) independently for all i = 1, . . . K countries, obtained by adding the
cluster I and II observations as pseudocounts to a uniform Dirichlet distribution. Weakly informative
Cauchy priors with scale 0.5 are assigned to the each unique diagonal (variance) element of Σ. A
weakly informative LKJ correlation distribution with shape parameter 2 is assigned as the prior for
the correlation matrices corresponding to the blocks of Σ. Finally, uniform priors are assigned for
α.
To obtain the samples for the posterior distribution of the parameters, Markov chain Monte
Carlo sampling for the model was carried out via Stan (Carpenter et al., 2017). Four parallel chains
were run, with 5000 iterations each and the first half discarded as burn-in.

3.2

Sampling methods for local protein structure analysis

Certain mutant clusters may have a higher prevalence than others, as identified via the estimates
for α. A natural follow-up question is to ask whether these differences might be related to changes
in the 3-D structure of the S-protein as a result of the common mutations shown in Table 2.
To compare two 3-D protein structures, it is standard practice to compute the root-mean-square
deviation (RMSD) between its corresponding backbone atoms; the four backbone atoms (N, Cα , C,
O) are common to all amino acids, so this RMSD calculation can be applied even when amino acid
mutations are present and provides a simple metric for assessing structural changes. However, as
9

described in section 2.2, currently the PDB lacks laboratory-determined structures for all but the
D614G mutation, and thus modeling approaches are needed.
A protein structure is represented by the arrangement of its atoms in 3-D space, which is known
as a conformation. Letting x denote a conformation and H a given scalar energy (or potential)
function, a statistics-based approach to the problem is to draw samples from the Boltzmann distribution
π(x) ∝ exp {−H(x)/T } ,

(2)

where T is the effective temperature. According to the energy landscape theory (Onuchic et al.,
1997), a protein structure tends to be most stable around the lowest energy conformation. While
nature’s ‘true’ energy function is not known, various energy approximations H have been developed
to mimic this property for use in computational protein structure prediction (Zhang et al., 2007b).
Thus in this context, the goal is to draw samples from equation (2) corresponding to the amino acid
sequence before and after mutation, to assess possible structure differences among the low-energy
conformations sampled.
We focus here on local structural impacts, that is, possible changes to the protein structure
in the segment of amino acids near the mutation position. To do so, we treat the PDB structure
in Zhou et al. (2020b) (with accession code 6XM0, and visualized in Figure 3) as the reference
consensus 3-D structure for the S-protein corresponding to the reference sequence. Then we may
sample conformations for specific segments of amino acids while holding the rest of the structure
fixed at the coordinates in this reference 3-D structure. Segment lengths of up to approximately 15
amino acids has been recognized to be a rough upper bound where current sampling methods can
perform adequately (Webb and Sali, 2017). For an individual mutation occurring at position j, we
thus sample conformations for the length 15 segment of amino acids from positions j − 7 to j + 7.
These length 15 segments for each individual mutation listed in Table 2 are highlighted in green in
Figure 3.
Since proteins are composed of a linear sequence of amino acids, a sequential sampling approach
can effectively exploit that property, by incrementally adding one amino acid at a time to construct
approximate samples from equation (2). The idea of devising sequential sampling algorithms as a
way to stochastically search for realistic low-energy conformations was originally proposed in Zhang
et al. (2007a) and tested on lattice representations of proteins. Subsequently, extensions of the
method applicable to real protein structures have been developed, including distance-guided chain
growth (DisGro, Tang et al., 2014) and sequential Monte Carlo (SMC, Wong et al., 2018). The
implementations of these two algorithms also use slightly different approximations for the energy
function H, and together can provide a more complete picture of the energy landscape. Thus
we apply these algorithms to sample conformations for the segments shown in Figure 3, on both
the reference sequence and the mutated sequence. Then following Wong (2020), we may compute
the probability distribution of RMSDs between pairs of sampled conformations, as a way to assess
potential differences in the low-energy conformational space as a result of the mutation. Specifically
for the D614G mutation, we can use its known structure in the PDB to validate the results of these
sampling methods.

that the daily growth rate parameters of clusters II to V relative to cluster I, estimated via their
posterior means, are -0.05 (-0.07, -0.03), 0.00 (-0.01, 0.02), 0.02 (-0.01, 0.04), 0.03 (0.00, 0.05),
with 95% credible intervals in brackets. These estimates show that during the study period, the
sequences from clusters IV and V tend to have higher growth relative to clusters I, II, and III,
of which mutant cluster II clearly has the weakest growth, as seen via its posterior interval that
does not overlap the others. Referring to the mutation positions in Table 2, this indicates that
sequences with amino acid D in position 614 (as in the reference sequence) will tend to decrease
in prevalence over time in the presence of the other mutant clusters. In addition, cluster I, which
is mostly characterized by the lone D614G mutation, may have a growth disadvantage if clusters
IV or V are also spreading in the country. The clusters with the strongest growth (IV and V) are
primarily composed of variants with the co-occurrence of D614G with S477N or A222V.

Table 3: Posterior means and 95% credible intervals (represented by the 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles)
for the parameters in the Bayesian hierarchical model. α represents the daily growth rate parameters
for clusters II to V relative to cluster I. σC is the random noise standard deviation for countries
within continent C, and p·,1 represents the initial proportions on Jan 7th, 2020 for all countries.
ΣC for each continent together forms the diagonal block matrix Σ that represents the covariance
matrix for the random noise vector.
The covariance matrix Σ for the random noise vector is set up in block diagonal form: each block
represents countries within the same continent and parameterized as ΣC = diag(σC )×ΩC ×diag(σC ),
where σC is the standard deviation of the daily noise term for countries within continent C, and
ΩC is the corresponding correlation matrix. Specifically, we defined four continents: North America
(NA) as (US, CA); Europe (EU) as (UK, NL, FR, SP); Asia (AS) as (CN, IN); and Australia (AU)
as its own continent. The posterior means for σEU and σAS are relatively larger than σNA and

σAU , indicating that overall cluster growth trends are somewhat more predictable in North America
and Australia than Europe or Asia. On the other hand, spatial dependence in the noise terms
in general is low for countries studied, with no estimated correlations exceeding 0.4. That said,
based on the posterior means, European countries still have relatively larger spatial correlations
in their daily fluctuations, e.g., UK and Netherlands have a correlation of 0.33, UK and France
have a correlation of 0.28, and Netherlands and Spain have a correlation of 0.22. The estimates
show these European countries may experience more similar day-to-day changes, while countries in
North America and Asia do not, as the correlation appears to be negligible between US and Canada
(-0.087) and between China and India (-0.045), both of which are close to 0. The relatively low
correlations between countries suggest that zero noise correlation between continents (i.e., block
diagonal Σ) is a reasonable simplifying assumption.
Figure 4 shows the posterior means and 95% credible intervals for the inferred cluster proportions
in the different countries on each day t from Jan 7th, 2020 to Oct 14th, 2020. The posterior means
of p·,1 indicate that on Jan 7th, 2020, cluster I accounts for around 10% and cluster II accounts
for around 90% of sequences. Nonetheless these initial proportions are quite uncertain due to the
limited number of early cases, as seen in the wide credible intervals on the plot. The credible
intervals narrow as we reach periods where a larger number of sequences are deposited. Overall, we
see growth for cluster I accelerates during January to June but appears to rapidly fall off in July for
many countries, while maintaining a substantive presence in the US, India and Australia. Cluster
II clearly diminishes over time worldwide, and cluster III is fairly small but stable for all countries.
Cluster IV estimates show small fluctuations for most countries except Australia, where it expands
to over 90% from July to August and may remain as the dominant cluster. Cluster V is estimated
to first appear in August and thereafter shows a rapid growth in all European countries.
Our Bayesian hierarchical model also allows prediction of changes in cluster proportions for
countries with missing or very sparse GISAID sequence data. Canada, Spain and China only
have deposited sequences up to August, while France only has sequence data deposited until midSeptember; our model is nonetheless able to provide the point and interval estimates for their
cluster proportions over the entire period. As suggested in Figure 4, both Canada and China
are projected to have cluster I gradually decrease together with a possible rise in cluster V; the
expanding credible intervals reflect the increasing uncertainty associated with the increasing number
of days with missing data. Meanwhile, the main clusters present in France by mid-October might
be IV or V (or their combination), while Spain is projected to be dominated by cluster V much like
the rest of Europe.
To ensure that our results are robust, we performed a sensitivity analysis on the posterior
parameters given different sets of priors, with a special focus on the sensitivity of α and pi1 . We
created the following three scenarios to compare with our base scenario prior choices in Section 3.1,
and the results are shown in Table 4. In scenario 1, we set the cluster proportions on the starting
date as pi1 ∼ Dirichlet(2.5, 38.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5), obtained by adding the pseudocounts to Dirichlet
parameters corresponding to the Jeffreys prior, that is, Dirichlet(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5). In scenario
2, we set the priors for each growth parameter αc ∼ N (0, 1) independently for c = 2, . . . , 5, instead
of the uniform priors in our base scenario. In scenario 3, we combined both changes to the priors
made in scenario 1 and 2. Compared with the main results in Table 3, all three scenarios in Table 4
show comparable posterior means and 95% credible intervals with the base scenario, which indicates
our posterior parameters are fairly stable and robust to the different choices of priors.

Local structural impacts of common mutations

For each of the nine segments identified in Figure 3, we ran the SMC and DiSGro algorithms to
sample conformations for the reference sequence and the mutated sequence. The specific segments,
including the starting and ending positions, are shown in the first three columns of Table 5. Note
that each of the segments considered contains a single mutation, for example, the length 15 segment
923-937 sampled for A930V does not overlap with 929-943 for D936Y since they occur in different
clusters. For DiSGro (Tang et al., 2014), we used the program from the authors to generate 100000
conformations and kept the 5000 with the lowest energies as the representatives. For SMC (Wong
et al., 2018), we ran the algorithm with 60000 particles as in Wong (2020), and also kept the 5000
with the lowest energies as the representatives.

Table 5: Results for the lowest energy conformations sampled by the SMC and DiSGro algorithms on
the reference and mutated sequence segments. The RMSDR columns calculate the RMSD between
the reference 3-D structure and the lowest energy conformation sampled for the reference sequence,
thus measuring the accuracies of the algorithms for reconstructing each of these segments of the
S-protein. The RMSDRM columns calculate the RMSD between the lowest energy conformations
sampled for the reference sequence and mutated sequence, thus measuring the extent to which the
location of the energy mode may have shifted in 3-D space as a result of mutation.

14

To summarize the distributions of these sampled low-energy conformations in 3-D space, we
used a similar metric as in Wong (2020), by computing all pairwise RMSDs between conformations.
(1)
(5000)
For each individual segment, let xR , . . . , xR
denote the 5000 conformations sampled for the
(1)
(5000)
reference sequence, and xM , . . . , xM
denote the 5000 conformations sampled for the mutated
sequence. Then we computed three sets of RMSDs, defined via
n
o
.
(k)
(l)
dRR = RMSD(xR , xR ) for k, l ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 5000} such that k 6= l,
n
o
.
(k)
(l)
dM M = RMSD(xM , xM ) for k, l ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 5000} such that k 6= l,
n
o
.
(k)
(l)
and dRM = RMSD(xR , xM ) for all k, l ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 5000}.
Thus the set dRR approximately represents the distribution obtained by repeatedly sampling two
random low-energy conformations from the reference sequence and computing the RMSD between
those conformations; an analogous interpretation applies to dM M for the mutated sequence. Meanwhile, dRM considers pairwise RMSDs between one random conformation from the reference sequence and one random conformation from the mutated sequence. Visual differences between the
histograms of dRR and dRM (or dM M and dRM ) would thus suggest that the low-energy conformations for the reference and mutated sequences lie in distinct regions of 3-D space.
Plots for dRR , dRM , and dM M for each of the nine segments are shown in the panels of Figure
5, normalized to be probability densities and smoothed via kernel density estimation (Botev et al.,
2010), labeled as Reference/Reference, Reference/Mutated, and Mutated/Mutated respectively.
These RMSD distributions are largely indistinguishable for most segments, suggesting that there is
little discernible impact to the local conformational space of the protein as a result of the mutation,
regardless of which sampling algorithm is used. Three of the nine panels do have some visible
differences between these RMSD distributions when sampled via the SMC algorithm: D574Y,
A930V, and D936Y. In each case, the Reference/Mutated probability density visually appears as a
compromise between the Reference/Reference and Mutated/Mutated densities, which is sensible.
In addition to the overall RMSD distributions, we may also specifically examine the lowest energy
conformation, as is often done in protein structure prediction applications. First, we considered
conformations sampled for the reference sequences, where the true structure is known from the
PDB. For both DiSGro and SMC methods, we computed the RMSD between the true structure
and the lowest energy conformation sampled by the algorithm. These results are shown in the
RMSDR columns of Table 5, which may be interpreted as the prediction accuracy if the algorithms
are tasked with reconstructing the 3-D structure for each of these segments. Overall, these results
show reasonable accuracies, with the segments 567–581 and 470–484 being the most difficult to
predict correctly for both algorithms. Second, we considered conformations sampled for the mutated
sequences, again taking the lowest energy conformation sampled by both algorithms. Here, the
true structures are unknown (except for D614G) so prediction accuracy cannot be assessed in
general. Thus, in the RMSDRM columns of Table 5, we instead compute the RMSD between
the lowest energy sampled conformations for the reference and mutated sequences, as a way to
quantify whether location of the mode of the energy distribution (as approximated by the samples)
has shifted significantly after mutation. Here, both algorithms agree in predicting that mutations
D614G, A222V, H655Y, P272L, and A930V result in relatively small local 3-D structural changes
(RMSD < 2) in the lowest energy conformation, while larger local structural changes are predicted
by one or both algorithms for D574Y, S477N, T632N, and D936Y.
For D614G, we may validate the sampling results as this mutation has been studied in the
laboratory with a determined 3-D structure in the PDB (accession code 6XS6, Yurkovetskiy et al.,
15

2020). The actual RMSD between the reference structure (6XM0) and 6XS6 computed over the
positions 607-620 corresponding to the sampled segment is 0.38 (coordinates for position 621 are
missing in 6XS6); in contrast, the RMSD when computed over the larger structural unit from
positions 531 to 620 is 2.61. This result indicates that the local structural change as a result
of the D614G mutation is indeed quite small, which is in agreement with the predictions of the
sampling algorithms. The D614G mutation does however lead to more substantive global changes
to the S-protein structure, which would be very difficult to predict computationally; general protein
structure prediction remains a highly challenging problem, despite recent progress (Kryshtafovych
et al., 2019).

Discussion

In this paper, we presented statistical approaches to tackle the challenges associated with the
analysis of S-protein sequence and structure data. First, to better understand the evolution of
S-protein sequences, we grouped the S-protein sequences into hierarchical clusters, and studied the
spatial and temporal trend of these mutant clusters using a Bayesian hierarchical model. Second,
we used sampling algorithms to investigate the possible changes in the local 3-D structure of the
S-protein in the segments where the most frequent mutations occurred.
Based on our model estimates, we found that on average the reference sequence and its closelyrelated variants will diminish, while variants with the co-occurring mutations of D614G together
with S477N or A222V tend to increase most strongly in prevalence over time. Our estimates of
trend not only examined individual mutations as was analyzed in Korber et al. (2020), but also
captured the prevalence of some co-occurring mutations that have so far received limited attention
in the literature. Nonetheless, our findings on the reference sequence do align with Korber et al.
(2020), where the authors showed that a transition of position 614 from D to G occurred in many
regions around the world with varying levels of statistical significance. Our estimates of S477N and
A222V are in agreement with the trends observed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory, and
A222V in particular is also consistent with Hodcroft et al. (2020) where the authors reported its
presence in the majority of sequences in Europe by the fall of 2020. In addition, we found spatial
dependence in COVID-19 transmission across country boundaries to be low in general, but higher
within Europe. This could be related to their relatively loose travel policies within EU members
during COVID-19 (European Commission, 2020). Finally, a useful feature of our Bayesian approach
is the ability to make projections of cluster proportions in countries where data is scarce or missing.
The result of the sequence analysis suggests potential fitness advantages or higher infectiousness
for the co-occurring mutations D614G + S477N and D614G + A222V. In reality, while higher
infectiousness may fully explain their growth in prevalence, other epidemiological factors may also
play a role, for example, the characteristics of the infected population and the founder effect (Korber
et al., 2020). Although Li et al. (2020) confirmed that D614G combined with other mutations (e.g.,
L5F, V341I, K458R, etc.) are more infectious than the reference sequence, the infectivities of
D614G + S477N or D614G + A222V have not yet been mentioned and examined. Therefore,
further experimental evidence is needed to confirm the increased infectivity of these co-occurrent
mutations.
Having identified differences in the relative growth rates of the five mutant clusters considered,
we examined whether the most common sequence mutations in these clusters were associated with
changes in the 3-D structure of the protein near the mutation location. Based on two different
sampling algorithms, we conclude that evidence for large local structure changes is generally weak.
This computational result is consistent with the ground truth in the PDB for the one mutation

(D614G) that has been studied in the laboratory thus far. For the mutations S477N and T632N
which are associated with cluster IV, both algorithms agree that a shift in the local 3-D conformation
with lowest energy might be possible (with change in RMSD greater than ∼3). Since protein
structure determination experiments cannot keep pace with genome sequencing, we anticipate that
computational approaches will continue to play an important role in understanding the possible
structural impact of mutations.
Overall, S-protein sequence and structure datasets are a rich source of information that further
research efforts can leverage for better understanding COVID-19, and we list some examples. First,
the sequence data could be expanded to include other data sources; the sequences used in this
paper were collected from GISAID only where the sequence deposition rates from some countries
is low. Second, the sequence data could be combined with data on COVID-19 testing and case
counts to estimate the actual prevalence of mutant clusters in different countries, in addition to
their proportions. Third, many laboratories have separately contributed S-protein structures to
the PDB and these could be further analyzed to quantify uncertainties associated with structure
determination efforts.
