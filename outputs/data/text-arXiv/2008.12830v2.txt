Spike (S) glycoproteins mediate the coronavirus entry into the host cell. The S1 subunit of
S-proteins contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that is able to recognize different host
receptors, highlighting its remarkable capacity to adapt to their hosts along the viral evolution.
While RBD in spike proteins is determinant for the virus-receptor interaction, the active residues lie
at the receptor-binding motif (RBM), a region located in RBD that plays a fundamental role binding
the outer surface of their receptors. Here, we address the hypothesis that SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 strains able to use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) proteins have adapted their
RBM along the viral evolution to explore specific conformational topology driven by the residues
YGF to infect host cells. We also speculate that this YGF-based mechanism can act as a protein
signature located at the RBM to distinguish coronaviruses able to use ACE2 as a cell entry receptor.

INTRODUCTION

Viruses are the most numerous type of biological entity
on Earth and the identification of novel viruses continues to enlarge the known viral biosphere [1, 2]. This
collection of all viruses presents enormous morphological
and genomic diversity as a result of continuous exchange
of genetic material with the host cells [3, 4]. Moreover,
this well succeeded long-term virus-host interaction indicates that viruses are more than simple genomic parasites in all cellular life forms [5]. A number of evidences
has led to the proposal that viruses play an astonishing role as agents of evolution because of their capacity
in propagating between biomes [6] and in gene transfer
between species [7–10]. For this purpose, viruses have
developed large number of genome replication and protein expression strategies to benefit from the host translational machinary over time [11].
Despite all of such enormous diversity in gene sequence, it is not possible to achieve huge number of highly
distinct protein structures mainly because of stereochemical constraints on the possible protein folds [12]. In
fact, it has been observed common secondary structures
throughout different virus families while the sequences
are not fully conserved [12, 13]. This may result in evolutionary efficiency once viruses can exploit already well
designed motifs from similar cellular functions [11].
Currently, the world population is confronting a new
coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a highly infectious disease to humans. This disease is caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and
is affecting human health worldwide. Coronaviruses
(CoVs) belong to the large and diverse family Coronaviridae, within the order Nidovirales and suborder

Cornidovirineae [14]. Their subfamily Orthocoronavirinae contains four genera based on phylogeny and termed
as α, β, γ, and δ-coronavirus.
SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the β-coronavirus genus as
well as SARS-CoV, middle east respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and hCoV-HKU1, to cite a
few [15]. Other important representative human viruses
as hCoV-NL63 and hCoV-229E belong to α-coronavirus.
Phylogenetic relationships among the known members of
this subfamily indicate that α and β-coronavirus infect
mammals, while γ and δ-coronavirus infect both mammalians and avians.
Members of Coronaviridae family are enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses and render
the largest genomes among all known RNA viruses [16–
19]. The +ssRNA genomes undergo rapid mutational
changes [20], leading to faster adaptation to new hosts,
though they also contain conserved sequence motifs as
observed, for example, in multiple alignments do CoV
strains [13, 21, 22].
Coronaviruses attach to host cell surface receptors via
their spike (S) glycoproteins, located on the viral envelope, to mediate the entry into the host cell. Each
monomer of trimeric S-protein comprises two subunits
S1 and S2, responsible for the viral attachment and for
the membrane fusion, respectively [23–25]. The S1 coronavirus subunit contains the receptor-binding domain
(RBD) that is able to recognize different host receptors,
highlighting its remarkable capacity to adapt to their
hosts along the viral evolution. Thus, it is not unexpected to observe in this domain high sequence divergence even for the same coronavirus identified in different host species. In contrast, the S2 subunit presents the
most conserved region in the S-protein.
The binding of RBD spike proteins to the receptor on
the host cell is the first step in virus infection. This initial step is followed by an entry mechanism of enveloped
viruses into target cells. Usually, most viruses enter cells

2
through endocytotic pathways with the fusion occurring
in the endosomes, although a direct entry into cells can
occur by fusion of their envelopes with the cell membrane
[26].
A number of CoVs utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the entry receptor into cells, exemplified by β-genus human respiratory SARS-CoV, SARSCoV-2, and α-genus hCoV-NL63 [15, 27–29]. In particular, SARS-CoV, as well as SARS-CoV-2, enter the
cell via endocytosis induced by RBD complexed with human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor [30–34]. In contrast, the
β-genus MERS-CoV and its genetically related bat CoVHKU4 utilize dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) as the viral
receptor [35]. Other viral receptor is aminopeptidase N
(APN), recognized for example by the α-genus hCoV229E [36].
The human coronaviruses hCoV-HKU1, hCoV-229E,
hCoV-NL63, and hCoV-OC43, cause mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infections [37], while SARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2 cause severe respiratory diseases,
with SARS-CoV-2 being far more lethal than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV strains vary enormously in infectivity, which
can be connected to their binding affinities to hACE2
[38]. This binding affinity, in turn, can be correlated
with disease severity in humans [39].
While RBD in spike proteins is determinant for the
virus-receptor interaction, the active residues lie at the
receptor-binding motif (RBM), which is part of RBD
and plays a fundamental role binding the outer surface
of their receptors [27, 28, 38, 40, 41]. The importance
of the RBM is further explored here in relation to its
structural topology. Thus, instead of only analysing
specific residues that make contacts with ACE2 after
binding, we go a step further and track the molecular
origin that drives the viral attachment to this cell receptor. This investigation has revealed a highly conserved amino acid residue sequence Tyr-Gly-Phe (YGF)
in coronavirus variants that employ this receptor. Consequently, we hypothesize that the short sequence YGF
is vital for RBD-ACE2 interaction because of the formation of a hydrophobic pocket proper to the receptor specificity [40, 42–44]. Moreover, we recognize that a similar
binding mechanism is characteristic of the interaction between ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain proteins and
ubiquitin. In this vein, we conclude that is plausible that
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains able to use ACE2
proteins have adapted their RBM along the viral evolution to explore such a mechanism to infect host cells.

A.

The conserved XGF loop in UBA-ubiquitin
interaction

Amino acid sequences of type XGF, where the residue
X is frequently the residue Met, form a highly conserved loop characteristic of ubiquitin-associated (UBA)
domain that occurs in a variety of proteins. The UBA domain is a conserved motif through eukaryotic evolution

and is found in many proteins related to the ubiquitin
metabolism and in particular, associated with ubiquitinmediated proteolysis [45, 46]. The MGF loop in the UBA
domain is typical of a hydrophobic pocket that is critical
for recognition and binding affinity to ubiquitin through
a hydrophobic surface patch located in the vicinity of
this loop [47–54]. UBA domains are ubiquitin receptors
whose binding is a fundamental step for diverse regulatory functions.
NMR analyses of UBA-ubiquitin interactions identify
hydrophobic surface patches formed by the conserved
MGF sequence as the main determinants for the proteinprotein interaction. A number of alignments of UBA
domains has revealed mutations in the MGF sequence,
mainly M→L, M→Q, and F→Y, but these mutations
still maintain the overall hydrophobic characteristic for
the main set of residues located at the interface on these
UBA domains [55, 56].

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Spike receptor-binding motifs in human CoVs

Here, we investigate the occurrence and importance of
the specific amino acid residue sequence YGF for SARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains able to use ACE2 proteins
as receptors. It is displayed in Fig 1a the interface of
SARS-CoV RBD spike-protein (magenta and green color)
complexed with hACE2 (blue color) to gain insight about
the importance of this type of conformational mechanism
in creating a shape complementarity between receptor
and ligand. The RBM is in magenta color, with the yellow color displaying the YGFY sequence in that pocket,
which establishes the proper relative position for favorable binding to surface-exposed hACE2 residues. The
YGFY sequence seems strongly conserved in SARS-CoV
spike RBD, more precisely located at residues 481-484 in
the receptor binding motif. Noteworthy, this sequence
seems to be unique because even the shorter YGF sequence does not occur in this region, neither in the RBD.
As a consequence of this hydrophobic pocket, amino acid
residues responsible for binding interaction are located
close to this conformational structure as, for example,
the residues N479 and T487 (Fig 2a). These residues
have been identified to be essential for SARS-CoV spike
RBD/ACE2 binding [39, 41, 57]. The residue N479 in
SARS-CoV is located near K31 of hACE2 which in turn
makes a salt bridge with E35, a residue buried in that
hydrophobic environment. The residue T487 is located
close to K353 on hACE2, and in turn makes a salt bridge
with D38, also buried in that pocket. Other important
residues for this attachment are Y442, L472, and D480
[40].
Figure 3a displays the residues of SARS-CoV RBM
in direct contact with hACE2 as determined by
the hydrophobic-hydrophilic properties of the interface
residues as predicted by the CSU program [58]. This

of residues that are located near the YGF sequence and

by YGFQ as a result of sequence alignments shown in
Fig 4. The single-point mutation Y484→Q498 replaces a
hydrophobic residue in SARS-CoV by a hydrophilic one
in SARS-CoV-2.
Figure 4 compares residue sequences of human SARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains aligned with RBM of
SARS-CoV Tor2, an epidemic strain isolated from humans during the SARS epidemic in 2002-2003. The human Tor2 strain has high affinity for hACE2 [38]. We
highlight in this figure in medium purple color the hydrophobic sequence YGFY typical of SARS-CoV, occur-

ring at positions 481-484 in the spike protein. The corresponding mutated sequence occurs now at positions 495498 in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
The important residues for the interface interaction
found in SARS-CoV are mutated in SARS-CoV-2.
The sequence alignments show the mapping,
Y442→L455, L472→F486, N479→Q493, D480→S494,
and T487→N501. These mutations do not present
a drastic change in their hydrophobic character [59],
thus preserving the overall receptor-binding topological
structure for these viruses. In particular, residues L455

5
and Q493 in SARS-CoV-2 preserve the noted favourable
interactions with the residues E35 and K31 in hACE2
[60] (Fig 2b). Interestingly, a new GF sequence appears
in the RBM of SARS-CoV-2 strains as a consequence of
the mutation L472→F486, producing a small hydrophobic surface, but does not seem to disrupt the proposed
topological formation mechanism for ACE2 binding. No
other GF sequence appears in their RBD.
Figure 3b displays the SARS-CoV-2 RBM residues in
direct contact with hACE2 as predicted by the CSU program, showing again the importance of residues close to
the hydrophobic pocket. Details of protein-protein binding interfaces can be quite different among strains, likely
related to their infectivity degree. It has been noted that
mutations in RBM residue T487 in SARS-CoV have an
important role in the human-to-human and animal-tohuman transmission of SARS-CoV [36, 38, 57].
Now, we investigate the relevance of the hydrophobic
pocket driven by the YGFY sequence in promoting the
stability of SARS-CoV spike receptor binding domain
complexed with hACE2. To this end, we conducted a
series of mutations to estimate the change in binding
affinity ∆∆G using the MutaBind2 method [61].
Initially, we investigate the influence of N479 mutation by the residues E, K, Q, R, and S on the complexation. The mutations N479E, N479K, N479Q, N479R,
and N479S have been observed, respectively in pangolin
strains (see Fig. 6), bat and palm civet strains (see Fig.
5 and 6), human SARS-CoV-2 (see Fig. 4), bat and palm
civet strains (see Fig. 5 and 6), and bat strains (see Fig.
5). The calculation of ∆∆G for these mutations does
not indicate any appreciable effect on SARS-CoV spike
RBD/hACE2 binding affinity due to its small variation,
as displayed in Table I. Therefore, we may conclude that
N479 does not enhance the binding affinity of spike RBD
to hACE2, and could as well be replaced by any of the
above residues, preserving the hydrophilic character [59]
and conformational stability.
Specific mutations were also performed to investigate
the importance of the residues forming the hydrophobic
surface patch for the complexation stability. Residues
Y481 and F483 are conserved through all SARS-CoV
strains we have analysed in this work, while G482 and
Y484 are mutated in some strains (bats and pangolins).
Therefore, we mutated G482 and F484 by plausible
residues, i.e., the ones that occur in other strains to evaluated the changes in the binding affinity. To perform
this double mutation, we fixed G482D, a mutation observed in bat strains, followed by Y484F, Y484N, and
Y484T, observed in bats; Y484H, observed in pangolins;
and Y484Q, observed in human SARS-CoV-2. The freeenergy changes for these double mutations strongly indicate the desestabilization of human SARS-CoV complexed with hACE2 (Table I). It is interesting to note
that G482D together with Y484Q decreases the binding
affinity in human SARS-CoV because they decrease the
hydrophobicity of the initial YGFY pocket. Table I also
displays the changes in binding affinity for single muta-

tions of Y484, a highy connected residue with hACE2
(see Fig. 3).
Next, we mutated N479 followed by mutations at sites
482 and 484 to analyse the consequences on the binding affinity of this triple mutation by disrupting the hydrophobic surface patch. Again, we fixed, for example,
the mutations N479E and G482D. The impacts of this set
of mutations can be seen in Table I. What was considered
to be a neutral mutation, N479E shows high destabilizing effect in the new conformational environment. Similar destabilizing effects on the human SARS-CoV spike
RBD complexed with hACE2 are obtained for the important residue T487 when one mutates the residues forming

the hydrophobic pocket (data not shown).
Now, we repeat the above procedure to investigate
the role of residues YGFQ for human SARS-CoV-2
RBD/hACE2 binding affinity. The mutation Q498Y does
not alter the binding affinity for the complexation because the predicted ∆∆G is about 0.16 kcal/mol. We also
analysed the impact of double mutations in the YGFQ
sequence on the stability of the complexation, see Table
I. To this end, we fixed, for example G496D and replaced
Q498 by the residues F, H, N, and T that appear in
strains of other species. The predicted changes in binding affinity by mutations indicate destabilization of new
complexations.

B.

Spike receptor-binding motifs in bats

It is known that not all SARS-CoV strains isolated
from bat hosts have exploited ACE2 as a cellular attachment. Therefore, the set of amino acid sequences
displayed in Fig 5 may exemplify the successful relation between virus evolution and the binding mechanism.
This set highlights in medium purple color the preserved
amino acid residues in the sequence YGFY, characteristics of human SARS-CoV. For comparison, we also display CoV strains with mutations in that SARS-CoV pattern to explore the relation between the hypothesized
mechanism and the cell receptor recognition.
It has been demonstrated that LYRa11 [28], Rs3367
[63], Rs4874 [64], WIV1, and WIV16 [28, 65], have the capacity to use ACE2 for cell entry as well RaTG13, in line

with our hypothesis. Also, the near single-point mutation
Y→F in the next six strains Rs7327, Rs9401, YN2018B,
RsSHC014, Rs4084, and Rs4231, does not interfere, as
expected, in the attachment mechanism. This conclusion
is supported by cell entry studies for Rs7327 [28, 64],
Rs9401, RsSHC014, Rs4084, and Rs4231 [64], because
they are in a group that is likely to use the ACE2 receptor. This mutation replaces a hydrophobic residue by
another one with higher hydrophobicity, reinforcing the
conformational topology for binding with the receptor.
This single-point mutation Y→F in human SARS-CoV
produced a neutral effect in the binding hACE2 (Table
I).
We identified in the next group constituted
by BtKY72,
BB9904/BGR/2008,
and BM4831/BGR/2008, respectively the mutations Y487T,
Y488T, and Y485T, decreasing the initial hydrophobicity of the expected pocket in these strains. It seems
unlikely that this mutation and amino acid residue
deletions associated to Tor2 RBM sequence affect
the YGF-based attachment mechanism for BtKY72
and BB9904/BGR/2008. Unfortunately, there is no
available experimental data concerning their receptors.
It is important to remark that the residue F492 in
BM48-31/BGR/2008 produces another hydrophobic
sequence IGF at residues 490-492 (Fig 5). We speculate that this double occurrence may disrupt the
aforementioned mechanism because of indications that
BM48-31/BGR/2008 does not interact, at least with
human ACE2 [28]. No other GF sequence occurs in the
RBD of these strains.

Figure 6. Sequence alignment of palm civet CoVs and pangolin PCoVs restricted to RBM residues of SARS-CoV Tor2. The
residues of YGFY pattern are in medium purple color. Last line includes the SARS-CoV-2 sequence for comparison.

Next CoV strains in Fig 5 do not contain such specific YGF sequences of residues in the RBM neither
in their RBD. We find the two-letter sequence GF in
Rf1/2004, but it is located in RBD and with GF surrounded by hydrophilic residues. Although we have considered only part of the sequences that better align with
RBM of Tor2, it has been demonstrated that the spikes of
HuB2013, HKU3, CoVZC45, CoVZXC21, Rf1, Rf4092,
and Shaanxi2011 do not use hACE2, a result that is not
just a consequence of deletions at the RBD [28]. Further support has been presented against HKU3 in using
hACE2 [66]. It seems unlikely that Rm1/2004 infects
hACE2 because its unfavourable binding free energy [67].
Another result concludes that Rp3 is unable of infect
hACE2 or even bat ACE2 [68].
We have placed together the alignments involving
Tor2, RaTG13, and SARS-CoV-2 at the end of Fig 5
for further comparison. The whole genome of RaTG13
shares 96% amino acid sequence identity with SARSCoV-2, and it is considered the most closely related
genome to this CoV [69]. Considering its spike protein, and RBM, RaTG13 shares respectively 97% and
76% amino acid identity with SARS-CoV-2. For comparison, RaTG13 shares 79%, 77%, and 53% identity,
respectively, for the whole genome, spike protein, and
RBM with SARS-CoV Tor2. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 is
mostly similar to RaTG13 than SARS-CoV strains in all
regions.

for the collected data, but with a single-point mutation
Y→H for pangolin hosts PCoV. It is worth to observe
that even the shorter two-letter GF sequence is not found
in the RBD of these strains, which could promote another
hydrophobic pocket.
We have included SARS-CoV-2 on the last line of
Fig 6 for a direct comparison. PCoV GX-P2V shares
79%, 77%, and 50% amino acid identity with Tor2, respectively for whole genome, spike protein, and RBM
aligned with Tor2. In relation to SARS-CoV-2, PCoV
GX-P2V shares 85%, 92%, and 75% amino acid identity,
respectively for whole genome, spike protein, and RBM.
It is believed that human SARS-CoV passed from palm
civets to humans in the 2002-2003 epidemic because their
genome sequences are highly similar [38, 57, 70]. The
amino acid alignments show an almost identical RBM
between human SARS-CoV, represented by Tor2 strain,
and collected data from palm civet strains. This identification also includes the YGF-based mechanism able to
use ACE2 proteins. Nevertheless, these alignments display high similarity between pangolins and SARS-CoV2, which also support previous conclusions on pangolins
being the probable origin of SARS-CoV-2 [69, 71]. However, based on our data related to host receptor binding
and their RBM and S-protein alignments, we can not discard bat RaTG13-like strain as also the possible origin
of SARS-CoV-2.

Spike receptor-binding motifs in palm civets
and pangolins

To explore further the role of YGF-based attachment
mechanism, we exhibit comparative residue sequences for
civet and pangolins, again aligned with RBM of SARSCoV Tor2 (Fig 6). This figure shows that the pattern
YGFY characteristic of human SARS-CoV is maintained

SARS-CoV and hCoV-NL63: only functionally
related

Although there is no many available experimental data
identifying the viral receptor-binding protein for CoVs,
it is well established that human SARS-CoV and hCoVNL63 both employ ACE2 as the cell receptor to infect host cells [72, 73]. Interestingly, SARS-CoV and
hCoV-NL63 domains do not present high sequence sim-

8
ilarity. For example, their spike-S1 subunities share
only 10% in similarity. Other features separate SARSCoV and hCoV-NL63 [74]. SARS-CoVs are classified as
β-coronavirus with subgenus sarbecovirus, while hCoVNL63 is in genus α-coronavirus and subgenus setracovirus. Although hCoV-NL63 also enters the cell via endocytosis, its functional receptor requires heparan sulfate
proteoglycans for the initial attachment, representing an
important extra factor for ACE2 to act as a functional
receptor [33, 74]. Moreover, the spike-S1 glycoprotein
of SARS-CoV binds more efficiently ACE2 than the corresponding spike-S1 of NL63 (NL63-S) [75]. This may
be linked to the fact that SARS-CoV and NL63-S contact ACE2 differently, a conclusion based upon the experimental results that NL63-S does not bind to ACE2
through a single and large domain [73, 76]. Actually,
different RBD regions have been identified within NL63S. One of these regions was positioned at residues 476616 and comprising three discontinuous RBM regions,
RBM1 (residues 497-501), RBM2 (residues 530-540), and
RBM3 (residues 575-594) [77–79]. A slightly different
RBD has been identified for this CoV [76]. It would be
located at residues 482-602, also with three discontinuous RBM regions, which surround a shallow cavity at
hCoV-NL63-ACE2 binding interface. Curiously, its spike
protein alignment with Tor2 does not show the expected
residue pattern in the corresponding RBM of Tor2 nor
in the aforementioned RBD regions of NL63-S. This may
help to explain the unusual pathway of binding to ACE2
for this CoV.

METHODS

We performed single and multiple residue mutations
to estimate the importance of the conserved residues in
human SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBM forming the
hydrophobic pocket in establishing specific interactions
with hACE2. Mutations may affect the spike receptorbinding complexed with hACE2 either leading to higher,
lower or even neutral binding affinity. Thus, we apply the
fast and accurate MutaBind2 method [61] to estimate
the binding free-energy change ∆∆G = ∆Gmut − ∆Gwt
upon mutation to predict its functional effects. This
method compares free-energy changes between mutated
and wild-type three-dimensional conformations. The
binding free-energy change upon single mutation was
also evaluated with the predictor BeAtMuSiC [80] based
on a set of statistical potentials extracted from experimental mutational data. This computational method
predicted very similar effects on the complexation (data

not shown) as described in Table I.
Bioinformatic tools
We have also used the bioinformatic tools BLAST and
ClustalW for sequence alignment and analysis of CoV
strains, and Jalview to examine and edit various sequence
alignments. Figures showing the conformational complexations were prepared using PyMol. The list of GenBank accession codes for the spike proteins analysed in
this work is available in supplementary Table S1.

CONCLUSION

We have analysed a number of CoV strains to support
the hypothesis that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains
share a common evolutionary mechanism for the initial
attachment to ACE2. Moreover, we speculate that the
YGF-based mechanism can act as a protein signature to
distinguish CoVs able to use ACE2 as a cell entry receptor whenever this residue sequence is located at the
CoV RBM region. For example, bat-SL-CoV ZC45 and
ZXC21 are closely related sequences to SARS-CoV-2 with
overall genome identity of ∼ 89% and can be promptly
put under suspicious in their ACE2 binding affinity because the lack of such signature. Of course, as exemplified
by hCoV-NL63, we can not discard that another mechanism can act helping such ACE2 binding. It must be
accentuated that the occurrence of other XGF sequences,
mainly with X being a hydrophobic residue, in the RBM,
or even in the RBD region, can disrupt the proposed
topological mechanism for ACE2 binding. This because
it might introduce hydrophobic loops promoting a new
ligand-substrate recognition.
