Abstract
This research was done during the DOMath program at Duke University from May
18 to July 10, 2020. At the time, Duke and other universities across the country
were wrestling with the question of how to safely welcome students back to campus
in the Fall. Because of this, our project focused on using mathematical models to
evaluate strategies to suppress the spread of the virus on campus, specifically in dorms
and in classrooms. For dorms, we show that giving students single rooms rather than
double rooms can substantially reduce virus spread. For classrooms, we show that
moving classes with size above some cutoff online can make the basic reproduction
number R0 < 1, preventing a wide spread epidemic. The cutoff will depend on the
contagiousness of the disease in classrooms.

Introduction

As most readers know, the COVID-19 pandemic began in China in December 2019, then
slowly spread around the world. Among its impacts on the US are changes to the education
system. After Spring Break 2020, many colleges sent students home and switched to remote
learning. During the summer, the big question became what to do in the fall. Colleges
across the US have moved classes online, restricted the number of students on campus, and
have modified semester schedules to run from mid-August to Thanksgiving with no breaks.
To further control the spread of the virus on campus, they have made dining halls take-out
only and reconfigured public spaces to encourage social distancing. In addition, there will
be daily symptom reporting, increased testing, as well as quarantine and contact tracing for
infected individuals.
In this paper we will consider two methods to suppress the spread of the virus. In Section
2, we ask the question: How much would spread be reduced if all students in dorms have
single rooms? This is a significant issue for Duke because undergraduates are required to live
on campus three of their four years, so at any time more than 80% live in dorms. By using
a generalization of the household model [1], we show that the reduction can be substantial.
In Section 3, we turn our attention to classrooms and ask a two part question inspired by
Gressman and Peck [2], who analyzed a complex stochastic agent based model to determine
1

the impact of having large classes be online-only. The first part is: How does the distribution
of class sizes affect virus spread? To approach this question, we considered two scenarios
for a college that has 1000 students, each taking 3 classes. In Scenario 1, all classes have
size 30. In Scenario 2, 1/4 of the classes have size 60, and 3/4 have size 20. By calculating
the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix that governs the spread in the second case, we show
that the basic reproduction number R0 is 48% larger in scenario 2 due to increased spread
in larger classes.
Knowing that larger classes promote virus spread, it is natural to move classes above a
certain threshold online. Thus, the second question we ask in Section 3 is: Where should
the threshold be for moving classes online? To address this question, we consider a scenario
where 2405 students take three classes each and there is one class of each size from 10 through
120. This is not a very realistic situation but it does allow us to investigate a wide range of
cutoffs. We find that the threshold for moving classes online to reduce the basic reproduction
number R0 = 1 and hence stop the spread of the epidemic depends on the basic infection
probability p in the model. For the values we investigate, the threshold can be as large as
70 or as small as 30.

Household model and college dorms

The question that motivates this section is: To what extent would the spread of COVID-19 on
the Duke campus be reduced if all students had single rooms? To answer this question, we will
use results that have been developed for the household model. See [1] and references therein.
The household model improves slightly on a homogeneous mixing model by partitioning the
population into multiple households with the probability of infecting an individual being
larger for individuals in the same household.
We will review the necessary theory on the household model in Section 2.1. In Section 2.2,
we examine the case where all students have single rooms by viewing dorms as households
and applying the household model. In Section 2.3, where we examine double rooms, we still
view dorms as households, but generalize our approach on computing the dynamics within
a household.

2.1

Household model

Let the population of size N = mn be split into m households of size n. For simplicity, we
consider the case of fixed infection time. Let pH be the probability an individual i infects
individual j who is another member of the same house. Let pG be the probability of infecting
individual j who is not in the same house as individual i. H is used to denote household,
and G is used to denote global.
Step 1: Connect each pair of individuals in the same house with probability pH .
P
Let πk be the probability an individual
belongs
to
a
cluster
of
size
k.
Let
µ
=
k kπk be the
P∞
k
mean cluster size, and let GH (z) = k=1 πk z be the generating function of the cluster size.
Step 2: Make long distance connections between individuals in different households with
probability pG .
2

The number of long distance infections caused by one person is Y1 ≈ Poisson(N pG ) if N is
large. The generating function of Y1 is Gν (z) = exp(N pG (z − 1)).
From step 1 and 2, we see that
R0 = µN pG .
To compute the generating function, we recall that if X, Y ≥ 0 are independent with generating functions φX and φY , then X + Y has generating function φX φY . This implies
that the generating function of the number of individuals infected by a cluster of size k is
exp(N pG (z − 1))k and hence that the number of individuals infected by the cluster of a
randomly chosen individual is
∞
X

πk exp(N pG (z − 1))k = GH (Gν (z)).

k=0

A well-known result for branching processes implies that the probability of a large epidemic
is the solution of
1 − ζ = GH (Gν (ζ)).
(1)
When we apply the household model to our dorm models by viewing a dorm as a household, GH will vary between models since the choice of single or double rooms results in a
slightly altered local spread within a dorm. On the other hand, since the global spread of
the infection is unaffected by room size, Gν will be the same for the two dorm scenarios.

2.2

Single Rooms

In adapting the household model to the spread of infection in a college dorm, pH will instead
be written as pD , since we are concerned with a dorm rather than a household. Similarly,
GH will instead be written as G1D , with the superscript 1 indicating single rooms.
We first compute R0 . Consider m dorms with n single rooms, where population size
N = mn. If n is large, e.g., 120 is the size of a typical freshman dorm at Duke, then the
total number of individuals infected in one dorm as a result of one infected is the total
progeny of a branching process. The branching process will have the offspring distribution
Poisson(λ1 ), where λ1 = npD . We assume npD < 1 so that the mean of the total progeny is
µ1 = 1 + λ1 + λ21 + · · · =

1
,
1 − λ1

(2)

Each individual infected in the dorm infects an average of npG individuals outside the dorm
so the basic reproduction number is
R0 = µ1 N pG =

N pG
.
1 − npD

(3)

Now, we solve for G1D . Breaking things down according to the number of individuals
directly infected by the first individual, the generating function of the size of the epidemic
within the dorm caused by one infected is

where G1b (z) = exp(npD (z − 1)), the generating function of the spread of the infection within
the dorm. One method for solving (4) is through iteration. We start with h0 (z) = z, which
corresponds to 1 individual in generation 0, and then iterate
h` (z) = z exp(λ1 (h`−1 (z) − 1)).

(5)

h` (z) is the generating function of the number of individuals infected in the first ` generations
of the process, so h` (z) ↓ h(z), a solution of the recursion.
In the case of single rooms, an explicit solution for G1D can be found by taking the
derivative of equation (4) to get the differential equation

G1D (z) = G1D (z)/z + λ1 zG1D (z)G1D (z),
with the boundary condition G1D (1) = 1. It is well known that the solution to the differential
equation is
G1D (z) = −W (zW −1 (−λ1 ))/λ1 ,
(6)
where W is the Lambert W function which is defined by W −1 (z) = zez .

Figure 1: Generating function G1D (z) for npD = .1, .3, .5, .7, .9. Solved by iteration with
Equation (6). z represents the initial proportion of students within the dorm that were
infected.

By (1), the probability of a large epidemic is the largest solution of
1 − ζ = G1D (exp(−N pG ζ)).
This can be further simplified. Plugging in G1D yields
1 − ζ = −W (e−N pG ζ (−λ1 e−λ1 ))/λ1 = −W (e−(N pG +λ1 )ζ eλ1 (ζ−1) (−λ1 ))/λ1 .
4

(7)

Multiplying through by −λ1 , then applying W −1 to both sides gives
λ1 (ζ − 1)eλ1 (ζ−1) = e−(N pG +λ1 )ζ eλ1 (ζ−1) (−λ1 ).
Recalling that λ1 = npD and simplifying, we obtain
(1 − ζ) = e−(N pG +npD )ζ ,
which is the survival probability for a branching process with a Poisson(R0 = N pG + npD )
distribution. We do not have an intuitive understanding of why this is true.

2.3

Double Rooms

Suppose now that we have m1 dorms with n1 double rooms, so that N = 2m1 n1 . For the
sake of comparison, we let the number of people in a dorm be the same, regardless of whether
they have only single rooms or only double rooms, i.e., n = 2n1 . Let pL be the probability
of infecting your roommate, and pD be the probability of infecting an individual within your
dorm. To find the analogue of G1b in this scenario, we think of a generation as having a first
step where the ancestor splits into two with probability pL , stays 1 with probability 1 − pL
and then a second step in which long range connections are formed within the dorm. The
offspring distribution is now a mixture of two Poissons:
pL Poisson(2 · 2n1 pD ) + (1 − pL )Poisson(2n1 pD ).
The mean number of infections in one generation, λ2 , will be the sum of the means of the
two Poisson distributions so λ2 = (1 + pL )2n1 pD .
Imitating calculations in Section 2.2, if λ2 < 1, the mean of the total progeny of the
branching process is
1
,
(8)
µ2 = 1 + λ2 + λ22 + · · · =
1 − λ2
and the basic reproduction number is
R 0 = µ2 N p G =

N pG
.
1 − (1 + pL )2n1 pD

(9)

To compute G2D , the analogue of G1D for the double room scenario, we note that the generating
function of the number of infections in one generation is
G2b (z) = pL exp(2n1 pD (z − 1))2 + (1 − pL ) exp(2n1 pD (z − 1)),
so G2D satisfies

G2D (z) = zG2b (G2D (z)).

(10)

G2D can then be solved with the iteration method described in Section 2.2.
Having computed G2D we can compute the probability of a large epidemic as in the
previous case by numerically solving
1 − ζ = G2D (exp(−N pG ζ)).

iteration. When pL = .7 and λ2 > .5882, there is a large epidemic within the dorm. The
graph of G2D (z) increased with z, regardless of the value of 2n1 pD . As 2n1 pD increased, the
value of G2D (z) at respective values of z slightly decreased.

A comparison of the epidemic probabilities ζ for double-room and single-room dorms is
given in Figure 3. Note that in the double-room situation when 2n1 pD = 0.7 or 0.9, there
is a positive probability of a large epidemic within a single dorm, so the curves are positive
when N pG = 0. When 2n1 pD = 0.3 or 0.5, pG needs to exceed a positive threshold for there
to be an epidemic in a university with double-room dorms, but those thresholds are higher
when there are only single-room dorm.

Spread of infection in college classes

This section addresses two questions. The first asks how different class size distributions
affect pandemic spread. The second asks whether taking classes above a certain size online
can prevent outbreaks.
To address these questions, we consider some simplified models in which each student
takes three classes. The situation can be described by a graph in which there are n students
and m classes with sizes ci 1 ≤ i ≤ m, and there is an edge from each student to the three
classes they are enrolled in. Each classroom is assumed to be homogeneously mixing. To
formulate the dynamics, we say that the three class members that correspond to one student
are their alter egos.
An individual that is infected in class i at time, adds his two alter egos (his presence
in other classes) to the infected population at time 1/2 and then infections at time 1 are
produced. None of the infecteds from time 1/2 are present at time 1.

3.1

Equal class sizes reduce spread

To show that class sizes impact spread, we compare two scenarios for a college with 1000
that each take three classes.
Scenario 1. 100 classes of size 30. An individual infected in class 1 at time 0 will produce a
Poisson(29p) number of new infected individuals in class 1 at time 1. His two alter egos are
equally likely to be in classes 2-100, and each alter ego will produce Poisson(29p) infecteds
in whichever class they are in. So if mi,j is the mean number of infecteds in class j at time
1 from a single infected person in class i, then
mi,i = 29p

mi,j =

2
· 29p when j 6= i
99

From this we see that an infected at time 0 produces an average of 3 · 29p infecteds at time
1 so
R0 = 87p.
(12)
Scenario 2. 25 classes of size 60 (1 ≤ i ≤ 25) and 75 of size 20 (26 ≤ i ≤ 100). Let m(i, j)
be the expected number of infections in class j caused by one infected student in i. ci and
cj represent that sizes of class i and j respectively. In this scenario, the probability that an
individual in class i has an alter ego in a different class j is 2cj /(3000 − ci ), where ci is the
size of class i. The 2 comes from 2 alter egos. Thus, we have
(

60 i ≤ 25
ci =
,
mi,j =
cj
2 · 3000−ci · (cj − 1)p i 6= j
20 i ≥ 26
Since the eigenvector x associated with the maximum eigenvalue will have xi = a for 1 ≤
i ≤ 25 and xi = b for 26 ≤ i ≤ 100, the eigenvalue problem for the 100 × 100 matrix can be
reduced to the eigenvalue problem for the 2 × 2 matrix with entries

Solving a quadratic shows that this matrix has eigenvalues 129.380p and 25.288p. Thus,
R0 = 129.38p.

(13)

This value is 48% larger than the R0 for scenario 1, and suggests that larger classes increase
virus transmission.

3.2

Stochastic model for scenarios 1 and 2

For a more detailed look at the two scenarios, we turn to a stochastic model. As in the
previous section the model takes place in discrete time. Each time step is roughly one
class meeting, so that two time steps are roughly equivalent to a week in real time. An
infected person in a class infects each other individual with probability p − 0.01 and has
a 0.5 probability of entering quarantine. Using (12) we see that R0 = 2(0.87) = 1.74 in
scenario 1. (13) implies that R0 = 2(1.2938) = 2.5876. R0 = 2.5 is a commonly used value
for an uncontrolled COVID-19 epidemic. Figures 4 and 5 confirm that Scenario 2 is worse
than Scenario 1.

Figure 4: A typical realization of the epidemic when all classes have size 30. The left panel
gives the current number of infections. The right the cumulative number. In this situation, it
takes roughly 11 weeks for the epidemic to reach its peak. By week 15, almost all individuals
on campus have been infected

The next figure compares the equal class size and 60–20 scenarios. In both scenarios,
the outbreak generally grows out of control within a few weeks and infects the majority of
students. In Scenario 2, the outbreaks tend to develop faster, have a higher peak, and vary
less in size and dynamics. Scenario 2 also produces a higher probability a large outbreak will
occur from one individual, and larger final epidemic sizes. Thus, it is clear that the presence
of larger classes, even if average class size remains the same, increases the risks for students
on campus.

scenario. The left panel gives the result for scenario 1, the right for scenario 2. The top line
is the 75th percentile, the next line is the median, the one parallel to the axis is the 25th
percentile. Note that, in Scenario 1, the probability of no community infection is 0.243, and
the probability of no major outbreak (no more than 20 total infected) is 0.432. For Scenario
2, the probabilities are 0.203 and 0.309 respectively.

is the same data shown in Figure 5.

3.3

Moving Classes Online

In this section, we consider the effects of moving classes above a given size online. To do so,
we consider a university with 111 classes, one each of sizes ranging from 10, 11... 120. The
total class size is 10 + 11 + ... + 120 = 7215 and there are 7215/3 = 2405 students. To begin,
we first consider when all classes are in person.
Following the calculations for scenario 2 in Section 3.1, we see that the average number
fo people infected in classroom j by an infected individual in classroom i is

Similar to the previous scenarios in this section, we find the largest eigenvalue of the above
matrix to determine R0 . Although we were unable to find the eigenvalue analytically, we
used Python to determine that
R0 = 251.5p.
When p = 0.01, R0 = 2.515.
We now look at the situation where the university moves all of its classes of size > k.
Viruses can’t spread through online classes, we have
mi,j = 0 when cj > k.
The other values of m(i, j) remain unchanged. The change in R0 depending on k and various
p can be seen in Figure 7, which makes clear that establishing a cutoff can sharply reduce
virus spread through classes. Although Gressman and Peck suggested a cutoff of 30 based
on their stochastic simulations for spread in universities [2], our results in Figure 7 suggest
that the optimal cutoff depends largely on p. For sufficiently small p, even cutoffs as high as
70 can be effective.

Figure 7: Basic reproduction number of COVID-19 after moving classes of size > k online
for varying values of p. Establishing a sufficiently small cutoff for moving classes online can
make R0 ≤ 1, preventing an outbreak for a large range of p. What is considered sufficiently
small depends greatly on p.
