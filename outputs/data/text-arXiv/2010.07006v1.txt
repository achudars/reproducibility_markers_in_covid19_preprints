Abstract
A method of transitional automorphic mapping of the genome on itself (TAMGI) is aimed at combining detection
and reconstruction of periodic motifs in the genomic RNA/DNA sequences. The periodic motifs (whether tandem or
sparse) are assumed to be randomly modified by point mutations and indels during molecular evolution and present
in the genomes in a hidden form. TAMGI is robust with respect to patched phasing of periodic motifs induced by
indels. We developed and tested the relevant theory and statistical criteria for TAMGI applications. The applications
of TAMGI are illustrated by the study of hidden periodic motifs in the genomes of the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (the latter coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 being responsible for
the COVID-19 pandemia) packaged within filament-like helical capsid. Such ribonucleocapsid is transported into
spherical membrane envelope with incorporated spike glycoproteins. Two other examples concern the genomes of
viruses with icosahedral capsids, satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV) and bacteriophage ϕX174. A part of the
quasi-periodic motifs in these viral genomes was evolved due to weakly specific cooperative interaction between
genomic ssRNA/ssDNA and nucleocapsid proteins. The symmetry of the capsids leads to the natural selection of
specific quasi-periodic motifs in the related genomic sequences. Generally, TAMGI provides a convenient tool for
the study of numerous molecular mechanisms with participation of both quasi-periodic motifs and complete repeats,
the genome organization, contextual analysis of cis/trans regulatory elements, data mining, and correlations in the
genomic sequences.

1 Introduction
A variety of genetic molecular mechanisms is based on the specific molecular interactions between biomolecules. In
many cases they are related to (quasi-)periodic motifs in underlying genomic sequences. In particular, the satellite
DNA composed of tandem repeats plays an important role in the structural organization of the chromosomes of the
higher organisms, whereas the short tandem repeats in human genomes are widely used in the medical diagnostics
and forensic [1–5]. Similar short tandem repeats were found also in some prokaryotic genomes [6]. However, in the
majority of cases the quasi-repeating patterns are present in the genomes in a hidden form due to random point
mutations and indels occurred during molecular evolution. The hidden repeating patterns can be tandem or sparse.
The most known examples are the patterns with the period p = 3 in the protein-coding regions [7] and the patterns
with the period p = 10.5 bp related to the pitch of B-form dsDNA (see, e.g., [8, 9] and references therein).
The methods available for statistical detection of hidden repeating patterns in genomic sequences are
numerous and comprise discrete Fourier transform (DFT) [10–14], discrete double Fourier transform (DDFT) [15–
17], wavelet transform [18, 19], Ramanujan transform [20], correlation functions [21–23], and information theory
[24, 25] (for a review and further references see, e.g., [26, 27]). These methods reveal the presence of hidden
repeating patterns, while explicit reconstruction of the underlying motifs is commonly performed separately.
Typically, quasi-repeating patterns are searched for explicitly by defining the lengths of repeats within a chosen
interval and by defining a chosen permissible number of mismatches [28–31]. The statistical significance of the
lengths and composition of found repeats can be assessed by the comparison with the counterpart characteristics in
the random sequences with the same nucleotide composition [32, 33]. By using such detection technique, the
periodic phasing of repeats is not obligatory and found repeats may often be considered as scattered rather than
phased. The patched phasing of hidden repeats induced by indels hampers additionally the explicit reconstruction of
repeats.
In this paper we present a method of transitional automorphic mapping of the genome on itself (TAMGI)
combining detection and reconstruction of hidden repeating patterns, retaining phasing of repeats, and robust with
respect to indels. The method of TAMGI was sketched briefly in [34] when applying to the study of
ribonucleocapsid assembly/packaging signals in the genomes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In this publication we develop the extended theory and derive the
relevant statistical criteria for analysis of the output set of patterns in TAMGI. To illustrate the applications, we
chose the genomes of the coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 packaged within the helical capsid as well as
the genomes of two viruses with the icosahedral capsids, satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV) and bacteriophage
ϕX174 studied previously [34, 35] by different methods. Such choices allow us to cross-check the features detected
by TAMGI and other methods.

2 Theory and Algorithm
2.1 Transitional Genome Mapping
The main idea behind the method of TAMGI is simple; if repeating motifs (whether tandem or sparse) are separated
by a space s, they can be mapped onto each other by the step s. The method is robust with respect to indels because
such mapping retains phasing of repeats within relatively long phased stretches separated by indels. The algorithm
for TAMGI is defined as follows. Let a nucleotide N m be positioned at a site m of the genomic sequence. The N m -th

3

nucleotide will be retained if it has at least one neighbor N m-s or N m+s of the same type and be replaced by void
otherwise (denoted traditionally by hyphen). All neighbors of the same type N m-s or N m+s should also be retained.
The resulting sequence after TAMGI is composed of the nucleotides of four types (A, C, G, T) and the hyphens "-"
denoting voids. Further analysis is reduced to the enumeration of all complete words of length k (k-mers) composed
only of nucleotides (voids within the complete words are prohibited) and surrounded by the voids "-" at 5'- and 3'ends, -N k -. By definition, the complete words are non-overlapping. At the next stage, the mismatches with hyphens
to the complete words can be studied.
To avoid end effects and to ensure homogeneity of the mapping, the linear genomes will always be
circularized,

if 1 ≤ m ≤ M ;
 N m,α ,
N mc ,α = 
 N m − M ,α , if M + 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 M − 1,

(1)

where N m,α denotes the nucleotide of the type α ∈ (A, C, G, T) positioned at the site m and M is the genome length.
Choosing circularized mapping is natural and convenient for the study of quasi-repeating motifs. The theory and
simulations show that for even M the step M/2 should be considered apart from the other steps. Therefore, the range
of steps can be chosen from 1 to

 [ M / 2] for odd M ;
L=
 M/ 2 − 1 for even M ,

(2)

where the brackets denote the integer part of the quotient. Formally, the action of TAMGI with the step s on the
genome can be presented in an operator form,

Γs = R̂s Γ .

(3)

Repeating operation with s fixed yields the same result,

Rˆ s Rˆ s Γ = Rˆ s Γ = Γs .

(4)

Eq. (4) means that TAMGI can be considered as a projection because

Rˆ s2 = Rˆ s . TAMGI operations with different

steps do not commute with each other,

Rˆ s1 Rˆ s2 ≠ Rˆ s2 Rˆ s1 .

(5)

2.2 Normalization of Nucleotide Frequencies after TAMGI
The frequencies of nucleotides after TAMGI with the step s,

ϕ α, s = N α, s / M ; ϕ total , s = ∑ ϕ α, s ,

(6)

α

should be properly normalized to assess their statistical significance. The normalization ought to be performed
against the counterpart characteristics in the random sequences of the same nucleotide composition. Below, we will
always imply that the length of the genome satisfies the condition M >> 1. The frequencies for the combinations

4

(non-N α )(N α ) k (non-N α ) (here it is implied that any neighboring nucleotides are separated by the step s) can be
assessed in the random sequences as

p k , α = (1 − ϕ α ) 2 ϕ kα ; k = 1, 2, ... ,

(7)

where ϕ α is the frequency of nucleotides of the type α in the genome. Then, the frequency of the nucleotides of the
type α after application of TAMGI, Φ α , is expressed through the frequencies defined by Eq. (7) as follows,
∞

∑ kp
k =2

k, α

= Φ α = ϕ 2α ( 2 − ϕ α ) ,

(8)

while the total frequency of nucleotides after TAMGI is obtained by summation over Φ α ,

Φ total = ∑ Φ α .

(9)

α

The variances for the frequencies defined by Eqs. (8) and (9) are determined for the random sequences by the
binomial distribution,
2
σ 2 ( Φ α ) = Φ α (1 − Φ α ) / M ; σ total
= ∑ σ2 ( Φ α ) .

(10)

α

This means that the total frequency defined by Eq. (6) can be presented in terms of a normalized deviation,

κ s = (ϕ total , s − Φ total ) / σ total ,

(11)

(for notations, see Eqs. (6) and (8)–(10)). As can be proved (see also below), the deviations (11) in the random
sequences are governed by the Gaussian statistics and the deviations for the different steps s are approximately
independent. For quasi-periodic motifs with a period p, the deviations (11) should reveal approximately equidistant
peaks at the steps s = p, 2p, ... A part of statistically significant deviations may be associated with correlations
between nucleotides.

2.3 Distribution of k-mers after TAMGI
The frequency of words of length k, -N k - (where N means nucleotide of any type), in the random sequences can be
assessed as,
k
p k = (1 − Φ total ) 2 Φ total
; k = 1, 2, ... ,

(12)

where Φ total is defined by Eqs. (8) and (9). Let there be n k, s words of length k after TAMGI with the step s. Then,
the empirical probability to detect a word longer than k' can be determined as,
k

k

k =k ′

k =1

max
max
~
P~rs ( k ≥ k ′) = ∑ nk , s / ∑ nk , s .

(13)

5

The summation in Eq. (13) is performed up to the maximum detected length. The frequency of words with lengths
exceeding k' in the random sequences is given by
∞

k′
Φ ( k ≥ k ′) = ∑ pk = (1 − Φ total ) Φ total
.

(14)

k =k ′

The probability to find a word with a length exceeding k' in the complete pool of words can be calculated as
k ′ −1
Pr( k ≥ k ′) = Φ ( k ≥ k ′) / Φ ( k ≥ 1) = Φ total
.

(15)

The empirical probability for the natural genomic sequences (13) should be compared with the predictions for the
random sequences expressed by Eq. (15). The difference between natural and theoretical distributions can be
statistically assessed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov criterion.
The probability density corresponding to probability (15) is defined as
k −1
k
p( k ) = Φ total
− Φ total
; k = 1, 2, ... .

(16)

Then, the mean length of words and its variance in the random sequences after TAMGI are given by
∞

< k > = ∑ kp ( k ) = 1 /(1 − Φ total ) ,

(17)

σ 2 ( k ) = < k 2 > − < k > 2 = Φ total /(1 − Φ total ) 2 .

(18)

k =1

The mean number of all words in the random sequences after TAMGI can be assessed as

n words = M Φ ( k ≥ 1) = M Φ total (1 − Φ total ) = M Φ total / < k > .
The maximum length of words within the interval of steps

(19)

∆s = s2 − s1 + 1 in the random sequences can be

estimated using Bonferroni approximation as
k′

max, ∆s
M ( s2 − s1 + 1) (1 − Φ total ) Φ total
= Ν thr .

(20)

A typical threshold for the statistical significance is Ν thr = 0.05, whereas the lower boundary for the maximum
length corresponds to Ν thr ≅ 1 .

2.4 Tests
The theoretical predictions for TAMGI of random sequences were tested by reshuffling the genomic sequence for
SARS-CoV (M = 29751, N A = 8481, N G = 6187, N T = 9143, N C = 5940). The frequencies averaged over 10,000
random realizations were in complete agreement with the theoretical results (8)–(10). The spectrum for normalized
deviations (11) is shown in Fig. 1A and is homogeneous for the circularized genome. As expected, the normalized
deviations (11) are governed by Gaussian statistics (see Fig. 1B). The distribution of k-mer lengths after TAMGI for
an arbitrarily chosen step s = 7437 is shown in Fig. 1C, while Fig. 1D shows the distribution of k-mer lengths for the

6

steps 1–500. Both in Figs. 1C and 1D the deviations for distributions of word lengths for particular random
realization from theoretical probability defined by Eq. (15) appeared to be insignificant by Kolmogorov-Smirnov
criterion. As expected from Eq. (20), the maximum length detected for the set associated with the interval 1–500
appeared to be longer in comparison with that for a particular step. Thus, the tests prove that suggested
characteristics can be used for the study of real genomes.

3 Results
For illustration of TAMGI applications, we chose motifs in viral genomes evolved due to specific interactions
between genomic RNA/DNA during packaging into protein capsid [36, 37]. As the main information in viral

7

genomes is related to the coding for different proteins needed for virus proliferation, the signals corresponding to
genome packaging are evolved using the redundancy of the genetic code. The detection and reconstruction of such
motifs are especially challenging because the specificity of molecular interactions is rather weak, while the point
mutations and indels induced mainly during replication stage are frequent. Helical, icosahedral or prolate capsids of
viruses possess a certain symmetry which can serve as a guiding thread to search for segment regularities and
distribution of motifs in the viral genomes [34, 35].

3.1 Quasi-periodic Motifs in the Genomes of the Coronaviruses SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2
At the middle of October 2020, the number of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) cases exceeded 37.5 millions,
while the number of deaths over all world exceeded 1 million (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). The
pandemia is still continuing and the second wave of diseases is pending in many countries. The development of
efficient medications and vaccines against the coronaviruses needs the knowledge of main molecular mechanisms in
the virus life cycle and virus-host interaction [38, 39]. The long (about 30,000 nt) non-segmented plus-sense singlestranded RNA genome of the coronaviruses is packaged within a filament-like helical nucleocapsid, while the whole
ribonucleocapsid is packaged within a membrane envelope with spike glycoproteins in a mode resembling the
outlines of the flower petals [40–44]. The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 caused the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemia
and appeared to be much more virulent than its relative SARS-CoV. The cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM)
have revealed that the ribonucleocapsid of SARS-CoV is helical with an outer diameter of 16 nm and an inner
diameter of 4 nm [42]. The turn of the nucleocapsid is composed of two octamers polymerized from dimeric N
proteins [43]. The pitch for the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid is 14 nm. The packaging of the SARS-CoV ssRNA
genome near internal surface of helical nucleocapsid with such parameters should correspond to 54–56 nt per helical
turn (or 6.75–7 nt per N protein) [34, 42]. The counterpart cryo-EM data for SARS-CoV-2 are yet absent. The
bioinformatic analysis may elucidate similarities between structural characteristics of the nucleocapsids for two
coronaviruses. The whole ribonucleocapsid structure of coronaviruses remains invariant under transition by one
helical turn. Due to the transitional symmetry of a helix, weakly specific cooperative interaction between ssRNA
and nucleocapsid proteins should lead to the natural selection of specific quasi-periodic motifs in the related
genomic sequences [34]. In this section we will show how these features can be established with TAMGI method.
We took for comparative analysis and illustration one genomic sequence for SARS-CoV (GenBank
accession: NC_004718; M = 29751, N A = 8481, N G = 6187, N T = 9143, N C = 5940) as a reference and the genomic
sequence for one of isolates of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank accession: MT371038; M = 29719, N A = 8873, N G = 5834,
N T = 9554, N C = 5458). The general overviews for the corresponding normalized deviations defined by Eq. (11) for
TAMGI steps from 1 up to [M/2] are shown in Figs. 2A and 2B. About two-thirds of the genome for both viruses
code for replicase proteins. The large-scale segmentation related to such coding mode is clearly seen in Figs. 2A and
2B. The pronounced peaks corresponding to quasi-periodic motifs with period p ≈ 54 are shown in the inserts. The
deviation for the step s = 54 appeared to be the highest for TAMGI data for SARS-CoV, whereas the deviation for
the step s = 54 is a bit lower than the highest deviation for s = 9 for TAMGI data for SARS-CoV-2. The deviations
for the multiples of the step s = 54 are also significant and indicate its quasi-periodic nature.

the genome of SARS-CoV-2 (shown by crosses) and its comparison with the counterpart distribution for a random reshuffled
sequence (shown by circles).

The distributions of k-mer lengths after TAMGI with the step s = 54 are shown in Figs. 2C and 2D and
compared with the counterpart distributions for particular random realizations. The corresponding distributions of kmer lengths after TAMGI with the steps within the interval s = 1–500 are shown in Figs. 2E and 2F and also
compared with the counterpart distributions for particular random realizations. The deviations between all natural
and random distributions were highly statistically significant by Kolmogorov-Smirnov criterion (Pr < 10-5).
The sequences after TAMGI with the step s = 54 and the lists of the words, -N k -, with k ≥ 12 for TAMGI
with the steps within interval s = 1–500 are explicitly reproduced in Supplements S1–S4. As is seen from the list of
motifs in Supplement S3, a part of the longest words for SARS-CoV was generated by poly-A signal positioned at
3'-end of the genome and corresponding to transcription termination. The counterpart signal was not reproduced in
the version of the genomic sequence for SARS-CoV-2. We retained, however, poly-A signal to illustrate the ability
of TAMGI to detect such signals as well. The comparison of repertoires of words with the lengths k ≥ 6 reveals their
partial divergence between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2; however, such words appeared to be closely conserved
for different isolates of SARS-CoV-2 despite the load from point mutations and indels [34]. The choice of the most
conserved motifs at the step s = 54 and the epitopes in N proteins responsible for the interaction between ssRNA and
N proteins provides the promising therapeutic targets for the development of an antiviral vaccine [45–47] (see also
[34] for discussion and further references).

3.2 Quasi-periodic Motifs in the Genome of the Satellite Tobacco Mosaic Virus (STMV)
The two next examples concern the viruses with icosahedral capsids. In the virus world, more than a half of viruses
belong to such species [36, 37]. The icosahedral symmetry comprises 15 axes of the second order, 10 axes of the
third order, and 6 axes of the fifth order. The total number of operations for the icosahedral symmetry is 60. The
correspondence should be searched between the (generally multiple) elements of icosahedral symmetry and the
character of large-scale quasi-periodic segmentation induced by weakly specific cooperative interactions between
genomic RNA/DNA and capsid proteins.
STMV, a small icosahedral plant virus with linear positive-strand ssRNA genome, may be considered as
one of the smallest reproducing species in nature (for a review and further references see [48, 49]). Its
reproducibility needs both a host cell and a host virus (tobacco mosaic virus in this case). The icosahedral capsid
consisting of 60 identical subunits with genomic ssRNA inside was resolved on 1.4 Å scale [50]. The visible RNA
revealed 30 double-helical segments, each about 9 bp in length, packaged along the edges of capsid icosahedron [50,
51]. The corresponding quasi-periodic segmentation on 30 segments with the period p ≈ 35.3 nt was clearly
pronounced in the DFT-DDFT spectra for genomic sequences [35].

∆s = 1

and

0.05 in Eq. (20).

The genomic sequence of STMV is of length M = 1058 (GenBank accession: M25782). About a half of the
genome contains two overlapping ORF, the longer of which codes for coat protein, whereas the other half contains
UTR. The overview of TAMGI deviations for the genome of STMV is shown in Fig. 3A. A significant deviation for
s = 38 which can be associated with the period p ≈ 35.3 nt appeared to be biased. The approximately equidistant
peaks at s = 75 and 110 were biased as well. Only a significant deviation at the step s = 69 can be associated with
the doubled period p ≈ 35.3 nt. The capsid assembly is presumed to be performed hierarchically via 5-fold
intermediate [52]. As genomic ssRNA participates actively in virion assembly [53], a similar mechanism may be
suggested for RNA packaging. The peaks that can be associated with 5-fold segmentation are shown in Fig. 3A (s =
211 and 427). The distribution of k-mers after TAMGI with the step s = 211 is presented in Fig. 3B, whereas the

11

complete distribution of k-mers after TAMGI with the steps from 1 to 528 is shown in Fig. 3C. The deviations
between these distributions and the counterpart distributions for random sequences were found to be statistically
insignificant by Kolmogorov-Smirnov criterion. The sequence after TAMGI with s = 211 in GenBank format and
the list of words with lengths k ≥ 9 are reproduced explicitly in Supplements S5 and S6, respectively. The plot for
the maximum length of words at the step s is shown in Fig. 3D. The insert to Fig. 3D reveals short-range (up to s =
10–20) correlations for such steps; the shorter the step s, the longer the maximum length of word. Note also the
correlations between significant deviation for the step s = 38 shown in Fig. 3A and the long maximum lengths for s

Fig. 3D.

3.3 Quasi-periodic Motifs in the Genome of the Bacteriophage ϕX174
The bacteriophage ϕX174 belonging to Microviridae family presents an example of icosahedral viruses with ssDNA
genome packaging (for a review see, e.g., [54]). The capsid of the mature virus is composed of 60 copies each of the
coat protein F, the spike protein G, the DNA-binding protein J, and 12 copies of the pilot protein H [55]. The
proteins H and J are associated with the inner capsid surface; the proteins H are beneath the centers of pentamers
formed by the spike proteins G. There is one-to-one association between J and F proteins. The interactions with J
proteins tether ssDNA to the inner capsid surface.
The circular genome of ϕX174 is of length M = 5386 and encodes 11 genes (GenBank accession:
NC_001422). DFT-DDFT analysis of this genome revealed a large-scale segmentation compatible with the
icosahedral symmetry [35]. The general overview for TAMGI deviations determined for the ϕX174 genome is
shown in Fig. 4A. The highest deviation for TAMGI corresponds to s = 180 marked in the insert and can be
associated with the segmentation on 30 segments compatible with icosahedral symmetry. The deviation for the
approximately doubled step s = 357 was also significant, indicating a quasi-periodic nature of such segmentation.
Another series of peaked deviations corresponds to the step s = 30 associated with 180-segmentation. The
commensurability of the steps s = 30 and 180 indicates the hierarchical nature of the genome packaging. Note that
both modes of segmentation on 30 and 180 segments were highly significant by DDFT analysis [35]. The deviation
at the step s = 90 associated with segmentation on 60 segments, though not prominent, was also significant. The
high deviation for s = 1828 can be associated with 3-fold segmentation.
The distributions of k-mers for the step s = 180 and for the steps from 1 to 2692 are presented in Figs. 4B
and 4C in comparison with the counterpart distributions for the deviations for particular random realization. Though
the differences between two distributions are poorly seen on the logarithmic scale, they are significant by the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov criterion (Pr < 10-4). The plot for the maximum k-mer lengths at the step s is shown in Fig. 4D
and again revealed short-range correlations seen in the insert. The clustering of maximum lengths around the steps
associated with the characteristic segmentation modes compatible with icosahedral packaging is marked explicitly in
Fig. 4D. The sequence after TAMGI with the step s = 180 in GenBank format and the list of words with lengths k ≥
11 for the steps from 1 to 2692 are presented in Supplements S7 and S8. Generally, the results of analysis by
TAMGI and DFT-DDFT appeared to be concordant for the ϕX174 genome. The motifs found by TAMGI can be
useful for the experimental study of the genome packaging.

4 Discussion and Conclusions
The common paradigm for the cooperative specific interaction between genomic RNA/DNA and proteins is based
on the consensus motifs in genomic sequences recognized by protein epitopes. The length of consensus motifs is
implied to be approximately fixed, though, generally, the motifs may be variable and clustered into particular
groups. TAMGI indicates the possibility of the other scenario for the molecular evolution of motifs. In the molecular
mechanisms related to quasi-periodic motifs, the evolvement of motifs may start from approximately phased
nucleotides of particular type followed by subsequent generation of the longer and longer motifs with a distribution
resembling that of defined by Eq. (15). TAMGI reconstructs the longer motifs from the shorter ones. The abundance

13

of primary phased nucleotides facilitates the generation of the longer motifs in comparison with counterpart motifs
in the random sequences. The longest motifs may serve as a seed of a particular molecular mechanism or play multifunctional role similar to cis/trans regulatory elements. The contextual analysis of the known cis/trans elements with
TAMGI may elucidate the mechanisms of their evolving and be useful for data mining.
The extension of TAMGI on the mapping of complementary stretches is non-trivial. Such analysis is
important, e.g., for the predictions of secondary structures of ssRNA viruses within the icosahedral capsids [56–58].
The geometrical constraints imposed by capsid and the interaction between RNA and capsid proteins make such
secondary structure different from free structure in solution. A possible extension of TAMGI for this problem can be
achieved by using two windows of equal lengths w with centers separated by step s. To exclude the overlapping of
windows, the inequality s > w should be fulfilled. The fragment within one of windows should, first, be mapped
onto its complementary counterpart and, then, such complementary fragment can be mapped onto the fragment in
the second window by the rules similar to TAMGI. Such complementary mapping retains the mutually
complementary nucleotides within windows. Varying s-w parameters provides a set of two-parameter
complementary mappings.
The pool of k-mer motifs reconstructed by TAMGI needs additional analysis. The overlapping shorter
motifs can be used for the putative assembly of the longer motifs. Nevertheless, even relatively short motifs with k ≥
6 for the step s = 54 appeared to be stably reproduced in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates [34]. This means that
the characteristic quasi-repeating motifs can be used, e.g., for subtyping of viruses or for the assessment of
evolutionary divergence between species. The inhomogeneity of motif distribution over the genome and the regions
with the highest and the lowest content of motifs may indicate their involvement into molecular mechanisms.
The short-range correlations of 10–20 nt shown in the inserts to Figs. 3D and 4D facilitate the molecular
recognition of long motifs. The near-by positioning of the perfect and mismatch motifs enlarges effectively the
recognition region. The proteins bound to such region may consecutively kinetically re-jump from mismatch to
perfect motifs.
To sum up, TAMGI method developed in this article is quite general and can be applied to the combined
detection/reconstruction of quasi-periodic motifs in the genomic RNA/DNA sequences. The method provides
insight into mechanisms of evolving specific motifs in the genomic sequences. Its scope of applications comprises
numerous molecular mechanisms with participation of both quasi-periodic motifs and complete repeats. The method
can also be applied to the study of correlations in the genomic sequences.
