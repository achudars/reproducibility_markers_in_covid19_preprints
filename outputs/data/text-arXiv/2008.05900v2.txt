Abstract
The outbreak of the COVID-19 leads to a burst of information in major online
social networks (OSNs). Facing this constantly changing situation, OSNs have
become an essential platform for people expressing opinions and seeking up-tothe-minute information. Thus, discussions on OSNs may become a reflection
of reality. This paper aims to figure out the distinctive characteristics of the
Greater Region (GR) through conducting a data-driven exploratory study of Twitter COVID-19 information in the GR and related countries using machine learning
and representation learning methods. We find that tweets volume and COVID-19
cases in GR and related countries are correlated, but this correlation only exists
in a particular period of the pandemic. Moreover, we plot the changing of topics
in each country and region from 2020-01-22 to 2020-06-05, figuring out the main
differences between GR and related countries.

situation, OSNs have become an essential platform for people to seek up-to-theminute and local information. Moreover, due to physical isolation and social distancing, people spend much more time on OSNs — engaging in expressing opinions, encouraging others, openly lambasting mismanagement, and voicing vitriol,
etc. Discussions on OSNs can be a reflection of reality, and topics about the pandemic mirror the public concerns in real-time. A growing number of research
links OSNs activities to COVID-19. Existing literature has already demonstrated
that posts about the pendemic on OSNs can be a leading indicator of COVID-19
daily cases [2, 3], related discussions on OSNs can be categorised into multiple
specific topics [4, 5, 6, 7], and OSNs may help to design more efficient pandemic
models for social behaviour and thus the government can implement more responsive communication strategies [1, 8, 9]. However, there are three main problems
within the existing researches. First, researches with geographic data are based on
coarse-grained processing of the location information [2, 10]. Second, the existing
topic modelling studies mostly focus on different topics in a relatively long period
(weeks or months) [6, 1] and general characteristics of user concerns, which cannot provide a precise representation of how topics change on a daily basis. Third,
shared information on OSNs over the global or nations [11, 2, 10] are too general
in terms of geographic dividing.
When analysing the COVID-19 information on Twitter by geographic locations, it cannot be ignored that the movement of population shapes the spatiotemporal patterns of the pandemic [12]. Population mobility plays an important
role in the spread of COVID-19. In other words, in terms of regions with highly
frequent and mobile cross-border commuters, researches only concerning political
sovereign states are biased.
To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of the ‘relational city’. Relational
city is defined as a region that “constituted through globally critical flows of capital, goods, and ideas, and whose economies are dedicated to intermediary services such as offshore banking, container- and bulk-shipping, and regional reexportation” [13]. in a nutshell, relational city is a specific set of cities that exhibit
spatial transformations due to the influence of advanced capitalism, and it can be
transnational. To be more specific, these cities tend to be located in cross-border
regions, influenced by different linguistic, cultural, and political systems, and rely
heavily on exchange economy, with a large number of cross-border workers. The
high mobility of cross-border workers brings high risks of virus spreading. Studies have shown that lockdown in relational cities is likely to have more severe
impact on economy than in cities of traditional concept [14]. However, up to the
present time, there is no data-driven analysis of OSNs COVID-19 information
2

about any relational city yet. The Greater Region (GR), a typical relational city
with Luxembourg at its centre and adjacent regions of Belgium, Germany and
France (i.e., Wallonia, Saarland, Lorraine, Rhineland-Palatinate and the Germanspeaking Community of Belgium) is chosen as the representative in our case study.
We define the countries mentioned above as the related countries of GR.
GR has the highest number of cross-border commuters in Europe, approximately 250, 000 per day.1 This makes GR a particular and outstanding example:
virus spreads due to its high mobility, as the whole business model in GR requires
a large number of cross-border workers to sustain. With the implementation of a
set of policies including border closures and the progression of the pandemic, GR
is affected in economy, daily life, travel, and other aspects.
This study focuses on two dimensions, tweet volume (see Section 4) and tweet
text (see Section 5) to analyse Twitter information in GR and related countries
about COVID-19. The following two main questions are addressed in the corresponding section.
RQ1 Whether there is a strong correlation between tweet volume and COVID-19
daily cases in GR and related countries, and, if so, whether tweet volume
can help predict COVID-19 daily cases?
RQ2 Whether there are distinctive characteristics of these region and countries’
topics about COVID-19 on Twitter, and whether GR, as a relational city,
embodies any characteristics in the topics?
We collected 51, 966, 639 tweets from Twitter, which are posted by 15, 551, 266
Twitter users all over the world from 2020/01/22 to 2020/06/05. Among them are
1, 643, 308 posts posted by 41, 690 users in GR and its related countries. To investigate RQ1, basic reproductive rate R0 and effective reproductive rate R(t) in
epidemiology [15] are introduced to slice the pandemic periods, and correlations
between tweet volume and daily cases in each period are calculated by Pearson
Correlations (PC). A novel topic modelling method combing Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) [16] and the Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) topic modelling method [17] is introduced, and a supervised
Support Vector Machine (SVM) [18] for classifying topics into given categories
is trained to study RQ2.
The main contributions in this paper are threefold.

(I) We screen a novel Twitter dataset of 2020/01/022 to 2020-06-05 which contains data from users with locations labelled in GR, and related countries
including Luxembourg, France, Germany and Belgium, and the COVID-19
related tweets from Chen et al’s dataset [19]. This dataset will be shared
with the public to advance related research.
(II) Spatio-temporal analysis is carried out to showcase how the COVID-19
daily cases are correlated with tweet volume in a long period. We find that
tweet volume and COVID-19 daily cases in GR and related countries are
correlated, and tweet volume can help predict COVID-19 daily cases, but
this strong correlation only exists during the early period of the pandemic.
(III) We find that GR, as a relational city, has distinctive characteristics in the
topics. Users in GR show more concerns in anti-contagion and treatment
measures before COVID-19 reaches its peak, and have a higher level of
interest in policy and daily life before R(t) < 1 than the related countries.
This study sheds light on how the Twitter users in GR and related countries react differently over time through an interdisciplinary approach. It may, therefore,
help to understand changes in public concerns on Twitter during the pandemic,
and in particular, the distinctive characteristics of topics in GR, a relational city
with high mobility.
2. Related Work
Some existing results have already shown that social media conversations can
be a leading predictor of a new pandemic cases [2, 20, 3], and in many countries
tweets increase in volume before the number of confirmed cases increases. Studies
have shown that anti-contagion policies can significantly and substantially reduce
the spread of COVID-19 [21, 22, 23], and the effect of policies on the mitigation
of spread varies, influenced by factors including culture, demographic information, socio-economic status and national health systems, where changes in public
knowledge may affect the impact of the policies. If the public adjusts their behaviour in response to information from sources that are not policy-related, it may
change the spread of COVID-19 [21].
Researches of public behaviour patterns of the pandemic have been conducted
based on data from smart devices [8], search index [24, 25], and COVID-19 related conversations on Twitter. Bento et al. [9] mention that, there is a spike in
searches for basic information about Covid-19 when the first case was announced
in each state in the United States, but the first case report does not trigger discussions about policy and daily life. Topic modelling, an unsupervised approach
4

that detects latent semantic structure [4] is widely used. Cinelli et al. [1] extract
topics with word embedding on a global scale, making the conclusion that social
media may help to design more efficient epidemic models for social behaviour
and to implement more timesaving communication strategies. The LDA model is
used by Medford et al. [5] and Ordun et al. [6] to analyse the topics in the early
period of the pandemic. Sharma, et al. [7] use character embedding [26] and Term
Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) word distribution with manual
inspection for topic modelling. However, LDA, a bag-of-words approach, which
is widely used to identify latent subject information in a large-scale document
collection or corpus, has some drawbacks: it needs large corpus to train, ignores
contextual information and performs mediocrely in handling short texts [27]. As
a result, these studies extract the topic over certain time periods, and the time
granules are too coarse to accurately reflect the trend of the topics.
3. Data Description
In this section, we briefly describe how we screened COVID-19 tweets from
Chen et al.’s dataset [19] to build our dataset of GR and the related countries,
and how we obtained information on COVID-19 daily cases for these region and
countries.
3.1. Twitter data collection
Twitter, one of the most prominent online social media platform, has been used
extensively during the pandemic. In this study, 51, 966, 639 tweets posted by more
than 15 million Twitter users from 2020/01/22 to 2020/06/05 are hydrated from
Chen et al.’s dataset [19] via the Twitter Streaming API. This COVID-19 twitter dataset collects tweets with specific keywords including ‘COVID-19’, ‘coronavirus’, ‘lockdown’, etc. Attribute with * in Table 1 is contained in the dataset.
To comply with Twitter’s Terms of Service, they only publicly released the tweet
ids of the collected tweets. To compose our dataset, we first hydrated raw data via
the API based on the tweet ids they provided, which included tweet id, full text,
user id and user-defined location information.
Secondly, as the user location information we collected so far is user-defined,
nether accurately revealing a true location nor machine-parseable, we processed
the fuzzy location context into real location information by leveraging geocod-

ing APIs, Geopy2 and ArcGis Geocoding3 . In more detail, user-defined locations
in many cases, detailed country locations are not included, usually just a city or
an abbreviation of a state. If user-defined locations are matched directly based
on characters, users who fill in this kind of context will be ignored. Geopy, a
Python client for geocoding services and ArcGIS Geocoding, a geographic information services system, geocode a fuzzy string into a complete address of a fixed
format including state and country. For example, ‘Moselle’ in Table 1 would be
geocoded as ‘Moselle, Lorraine, France’. Once the location information has been
geocoded, users located in the GR, Luxembourg, France, Germany, and Belgium
are screened by character matching. Table 1 gives an example in the final dataset,
and Table 2 shows the summary of the collected tweet data of GR, Luxembourg,
France, Germany, Belgium and the global. Figure 1 contains two heatmaps of user
location in GR and the related countries for a better understanding of this study.
3.2. COVID-19 data collection
The dataset published by the European Center for Disease Prevention and
Control4 allows us to obtain COVID-19 data including daily cases, deaths and
locations for the country we selected. As there is no official COVID-19 data published for GR, which is composed of Luxembourg, Wallonia in Belgium, Saarland

and Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany and Lorraine in France, we add up all the
data for the cities and regions mentioned above from the datasets5 published by
corresponding countries as the final GR data when counting daily cases and deaths
in the GR. It should be noted that as the number of daily new cases in France is
not available at the regional level, and deaths, hospitalisations, departures data
have been published only since March 18, 2020, data for Lorraine is counted as
zero until March 18, 2020, and the sum of hospitalisations, hospital departures
and deaths is considered as the total number of cases on that particular day.
4. Correlation between COVID-19 daily cases and tweet volume
To explore the correlation between tweet volume and COVID-19 daily cases
in GR and the related countries, we introduce basic reproductive rate R0 and effec5

tive reproductive rate R(t) in epidemiology to slice the periods of the pandemic,
and a spatio-temporal analysis of the correlation between tweet volume and daily
cases in each period is conducted by Pearson Correlations (P C).
4.1. R(t)-based time division
R0 is the expected number of cases arising directly from a single case in a
population where all individuals are susceptible to infection [15] and R(t) represents the average number of new infections caused by an infected person at time
t. If R(t) > 1, the number of cases will increase, e.g. at the beginning of an
epidemic. When R(t) = 1, the disease is endemic, and when R(t) < 1, the
number of cases will decrease. For the calculation of real-time R(t), we use a
Bayesian approach [28] with Gaussian noise to calculate the time-varying R(t)
based on daily new cases, which is also the official method for calculating R(t) in
Luxembourg.6 In this case, while the study of calculating R0 of COVID-19 is still
ongoing, we use the R0 estimated by WHO7 which 1.4 ≤ R0 ≤ 2.5. The results
of time-varying R(t) for GR, Luxembourg, Belgium, France, and Germany are
shown in Figure 3.
The relationship between R0 and the R(t) indicates the spreading ability of the
virus. When R(t) > max(R0 ), it indicates that the virus is spreading at a higher
rate than natural transmission, and the number of cases is about to reach a peak.
When min(R0 ) ≤ Rt ≤ max(R0 ), the virus spreads with the basic reproductive
rate R0 , which implies that the effectiveness of the containment measures is not
yet reflected in R(t). In short, the virus is still spreading freely at its natural
transmission. When 1 ≤ Rt < min(R0 ), it means that the virus is spreading at
a rate lower than R0 , the transmission is impeded, and the containment measures
are in effect. When Rt < 1, the virus spreads slowly, and can eventually die out.
Here, we divide the pandemic into four periods based on the above analysis,
which are: Pre-peak period (if R(t) peaks for the first time on day t0 and begins
to decrease, with R(t) < 2.5 on day t1 , (t1 ≥ t0 ), then the pre-peak period is the
30-day period before t1 ). Free-contagious period (1.4 ≤ Rt ≤ 2.5); Measures
period (1 ≤ R(t) < 1.4); Decay period (R(t) < 1). It should be noted that
the second wave of the pandemic did not begin at the time when this study was
conducted, so this division of intervals only applies to this time period, i.e., from
2020-01-22 to 2020-06-05. The precise time duration of these pandemic periods
for each country and region is summarised in Table 3.

The exact numbers of days of each pandemic period are shown in Figure 4 for
the region and countries. The Free-contagious period in Luxembourg and GR is
particularly shorter (4 & 6 days) compared to other countries (24-20 days). Being
a relational city characterised by high mobility, it may be relatively difficult to
control the pandemic. The reason why GR and Luxembourg, has a shorter Freecontagious period instead, will be discussed in Section 5 in terms of the public
concerns that reflected by tweet text.

Figure 4: Total days for each pandemic period

4.2. Research question RQ1
To answer RQ1, we test the following hypotheses:
H1 There is a strong correlation between tweet volume and COVID-19 daily
cases in GR and related countries.
H2 Tweet volume can help predict COVID-19 daily cases.
We calculate the correlation between tweet volume and COVID-19 daily cases
by P C, where a P C with a large absolute value means greater relation strength.
The results are shown in Figure 5. A lag refers to the tweets occurring after the
cases; a Lag = -5 days means that we match the daily cases with the tweet volume
from five days earlier, in other words, a 5-days lead.
Pre-peak period. As shown from Table 5, there is a clear trend of strong correlation (P C > 0.8, p < 0.05) with lags during the Pre-peak period, reaching
its’ maximum at -5 or -6 days, indicating that a correlation exists between tweet
volume and COVID-19 daily cases and tweet volume can help predict COVID-19
daily cases in this period. This is highly consistent to the conclusions presented
in the existing studies [2, 20, 3, 29].
Free-contagious period. There is no clear trend of correlation with lags except the
value of Luxembourg, indicating that tweet volume cannot help predict the daily
cases in the Free-contagious period. The period only lasted for 4 days in Luxembourg, which is too small to make P C a reflection of the correlation. However,
the P C values show a highly negative correlation between tweet volume and daily
cases. This indicates that there is a short downward trend in the discussion of the
pandemic after it reached its peak, even though the number of cases continued
11

to rise rapidly. This result validates the conclusion of Smith et al. [30] from our
dataset, who noted that public concerns of disease decline sharply after the peak
even though the infection rates remain high. In other words, the public concerns
of the pandemic decline after the Pre-peak period.
Measures period. There is a clear trend of correlation with lags, tweet volume
begins to level off, with a 0 or 1-day-lag moderate correlation (0.8 > P C >
0.3, p < 0.05) to the daily cases. Tweet volume cannot help predict daily cases
here because it fluctuates with the number of cases on the current or previous
day. It is worth noting that Pearson’s coefficient is sensitive to outliers and is not
robust. With too few dates included, a single outlier can change the direction of
the coefficients. This period existed for only 8 days in Luxembourg, resulting in
an anomaly value (P C = −0.903). It is assumed here that fluctuating changes
in tweet volume during this period are influenced by local news and policies, and
further discussion will take place in Section 5.
Decay period. The correlations between tweet volume and daily cases occur in
two ways. One is weakly correlated, the other reveals a correlation, but the trend
of correlation with lags is insignificant. Both ways demonstrate that it is not possible to estimate daily cases with the help of tweet volume during this period.
In summary, with the Spatio-temporal analysis of the correlation between
tweet volume and COVID-19 daily cases during the four periods of the pandemic,
we reject the hypothesis that there is a strong correlation between tweet volume
and COVID-19 daily cases in GR and related countries (H1) and tweet volume can
help predict COVID-19 daily cases (H2). More accurately, H1 and H2 can only
be confirmed during the Pre-peak period. In this period, regardless of the time at
which R(t) peaks, there is a 5-6 day lead between tweet volume and COVID-19
daily cases. Moreover, before the pandemic strikes, there is a high level of tweet
volume regarding the pandemic. On the particularity of GR, we find that the Freecontagious period in GR and Luxembourg are exceedingly shorter (6 and 4 days,
respectively), during the Measures period.
5. Topic Modelling and Classification of Tweets
In the previous section, we conduct an overarching preliminary analysis of
tweet volume, but without the in-depth discussion of tweet text. In this section,
we build a workflow to analyse tweet text as shown in Figure 6. This workflow includes tweet text pre-possessing, topical modelling, and classification of
the generated topics, each part is described in details below. We perform topical
modelling on the tweet text to extract the main topics discussed every day in each

region and country, and then train a classifier to distinguish these topics into 7
categories in order to observe and analyse the changes in the topics discussed in
each region and country during different periods of the pandemic. In parallel, we
observe and investigate whether there are distinctive characteristic of these region
and countries’ topics about COVID-19 on Twitter, and focus on the differences
that exist in the GR.

5.1. Text prepossessing and topic modelling
Text prepossessing. Prior to topical modelling, the tweets data needs to be preprocessed. All text are lower-cased, while URLs that mention usernames and ‘RT’
are removed as well. Besides, punctuation and numbers are filtered out, typos
are corrected by Symspell8 and stop words are removed. Then since the tweets
are collected based on the keyword search, we removed keywords such as ‘coronavirus’, ‘koronavirus’, ‘corona’, ‘covid-19’, ‘covid’ from the text to avoid bias.
Finally, Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is used for tagging the part-of-speech,
stemming and tokenization. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are selected.
Topic modelling. Aiming to identify the latent topics of the tweets posted by
the public in GR and related countries, we adopt the general structure of contextual topic embedding method (CTE)9 to extract daily topics and get a more
accurate picture of topic trends. CTE mainly consists of two components, LDA
and BERT, to extract different information from sentences to embedding. LDA,

14

a bag-of-words approach which is widely used to identify latent subject information in a large-scale archives or corpus has its drawback: it needs large corpus to
train, ignores contextual information and performs mediocrely in handling short
texts [27].
BERT utilises bidirectional transformers for pre-training on a large unlabelled
text corpus, taking both left and right context into account simultaneously, which
compensates for the shortcoming of LDA. Also, BERT is a method available for
sentence embedding, thus we concatenate the generated tokens of each tweet text
as input sentences for BERT to obtain sentence embedding vectors. CTE combines the sentence embedding vector generated by BERT with the probabilistic
topic assignment vector generated by LDA with a hyper-parameter γ. After obtaining the concatenated vector in high-dimensional space, CTE uses an autoencoder to learn a low-dimensional latent space representation of the concatenated
vector with more condensed information. Then k-means [31] is implemented for
clustering, and the number of clusters k, that is, the number of topics, reserved as a
hyper-parameter. We extract the word frequency in each cluster, sort and then take
the top ten as the representative topics of that cluster. In terms of visualisation,
Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) [32] is used for lowdimensional latent space degradation, which is the state-of-the-art visualisation
and dimension reduction algorithm.
The CTE rather than a single LDA model is chosen as our topical modelling
approach due to the fact that LDA is designed for monolingual contents and lacks
the structure necessary to generate effective multilingual topics [33]. GR, as a
relational city, are multilingualism. CTE includes BERT, a sentence embedding
model that can handle multi-language, can tackle this problem. Two adjustments
are therefore made to the original CTE. For one, we adopt the BERT-based multilingual model as the pre-trained model in BERT10 . In addition, some words appear
less frequent than in English which is predominantly spoken and are easily overlooked in LDA. Thus, we adopt the TF-IDF model to determine word relevance
in the documents [34]. We further feed the generated corpus by TF-IDF to LDA,
instead of simple bag-of-words corpus.
Average coherence score [35, 36] and average silhouette score [37] are utilised
as the metrics of CTE. We calculated an average coherence score by calculating
the topic coherence for each topic individually and averaging them. The hyperparameters are tuned to obtain the best results. The value of k is chosen from

5.2. Topic classification
After getting 4,763 topics from topic modelling, we then randomly selected
2,435 topics and classified manually into the following 7 categories:
16

1. ‘Wuhan & China’: Topics about Wuhan and China.
2. ‘Measures’: Topics about basic information including symptoms, anti-contagion
and treatment measures of COVID-19.
3. ‘Local news’: Topics about local COVID-19 news, including daily new
cases, deaths, etc.
4. ‘International news’: Topics about international COVID-19 news
5. ‘Policy and daily life’: Topics about COVID-19 related policies encompass
lockdown, closure of borders, limits on public gatherings and the impact of
the policies on daily life.
6. ‘Racism’: Topics about racism.
7. ‘Other’: Other topics.
The division of these 7 categories is based on the classification of COVID19 related Twitter topics analysis in existing studies [38, 5], and is determined
empirically on the basis of common knowledge and the status quo.
These manually classified topics are used to train a Support Vector Machine
(SVM) [18] for supervised classification. The reasons for training a classifier
instead of manually labelling all the topics are, on the one hand, the classifion of
all the topics manually is time-consuming, and, on the other hand, the classifier
can be used in further studies.
Words of each topic are converted to word frequency vectors with TfidfVectorizer11 and country are encoded with Label Encoder12 . The feature vector is
consisted by these two elements. Since our manually labelled dataset is imbalance in classification, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique [39] is utilised
for oversampling imbalanced the dataset and mitigate imbalances. The dataset is
split, 80% of which is the training dataset and 20% the test dataset. Grid search
with 10-fold cross-validation is deployed on training dataset to find the optimal
hyper-parameter, and the final SVM model is obtained with the entire training set
Table 5 shows the precision, recall, F1 score, support and Macro-average F-Score
of the trained classifier for each topic category. Then, the obtained SVM model
classifies the rest of topics. Table 6 shows the number of topics of each category
for each country and region.
The categories with higher percentages are topics of Wuhan & China and policy and daily life. In general, the number of topics about policy and daily life

is much higher in Luxembourg (56.6%) than in other countries (ave = 33.0%).
France, on the other hand, shows a high level of interest in local news (30.2%),
compared with other countries (9.4%). In terms of the overall data of GR, however, it does not show particular differences compared with other countries. Note
that as there may be cases where the cluster for a topic contains no more than two
tweets, we treat such topics as the invalid topic and remove them. This leads to a
different total number of topics in each country. Next, we introduce dates to plot
the changes in categories over time.

5.3. Research question RQ2
In this section, we aim to answer RQ2, i.e., whether there are distinctive characteristics of these region and countries’ topics about COVID-19 on Twitter, and
whether GR, as a relational city, embodies any characteristics in the topics.
Figure 8 reveals that in France, Germany and Belgium, the appearance of the
first case trigger only a small amount of discussions about the protective measures, and related discussions do not start to increase until OD. In other words,
the public concerns in these region and countries do not really heed the protective
measures until OD, when the virus is already spreading. This finding is at odds
with the conclusion of Bento et al. [9] that the announcements of the first case
have the greatest impact on the public concerns for searching basic information
about COVID-19 and its symptoms.
Moreover, the report of first case does not stimulate discussions about policies
and daily life as well, and discussions about it do not emerge frequently until OD.
This may be explained by the existence of a large interval between the date of
the first case and OD (27.3 days on average) in France, Germany, and Belgium.
During this interval, sporadic cases may not attract enough public concerns, and
the public’s concerns is still focused on China-related news.
The situation is different in GR, a relational city, and in Luxembourg, its centre. Figure 8 shows that the public in Luxembourg and GR start to have discussions about measures 1 − 2 days before the first case appears. Furthermore, during
the Pre-peak period, the CR of measures is much higher in GR (3.41%) and Luxembourg (7.62%) than in France (1.90%), Belgium (1.84%) and Germany (0.0%).
It should be noted that discussions of measures are not totally non-existent in Germany, but the tweet volume may be too small to be recognised as separate topics
during the topic modelling process. By comparing the topics discussed in other
countries of the same time, this may be explained by the late occurrence of the
first case in Luxembourg and GR, where the other three countries have already
passed OD, the outbreak in other countries may have attracted public concerns in
GR and Luxembourg. Concurrently, the results indicate that GR exhibits a high
level of interest in policy and daily life with 47.1% of total tweet volume during
the Free-contagious and the Measures period, while for Luxembourg, this rate is
66.1%. Figure 10(a) shows boxplots of the distribution of the CR on policy and
daily life during the Free-contagious and the Measures period. This shows that
the public is more responsive to policies as a region that relies on foreign labour
and has high mobility than Belgium, France and Germany.
The reason why Free-contagious is a period more transient in Luxembourg
and GR compared with other regions is still unclear, but part of the reason may
20

Figure 9: Word cloud of Luxembourg Tweets from 2020-01-22 to 2020-03-01

stem from the fact that the public concerns to the virus itself during Pre-peak
period led to better responsiveness to the anti-contagion policies in these region
and countries.
Interestingly, in Luxembourg, the discussion about policies and daily life persisted before the first case is announced and increased immediately after then. A
word cloud of the topics from 22 January to 1 March (date of the first case) of
Luxembourg is depicted in Figure 9, this shows that the topics are mainly travelrelated. This may be explained by the fact that the proportion of foreign residents
in the Luxembourg region is 47.4%13 , and residents are more concerned about
travel-related policies in Luxembourg and other countries.
In addition, Figure 10(b) illustrates that the Free-contagious and Measures
periods coincided with the France municipal election, and thus the public concerns
in local news among French is higher. In the end, during the Decay period, while
there is a downward trend (p < 0.05) in the total daily tweet volume, there is a
upward trend (p < 0.05) in the CR of policy and daily life, except in Luxembourg,
where the rate is consistently high.
6. Conclusion and Discussion
In this paper, we studied the information related to COVID-19 on Twitter, introduced the concept of relational city and chose the Greater Region and its related

country for our exploratory study. Our analysis has focused on two dimensions of
pandemic information on Twitter, i.e., tweet volume and tweet text.
Based on the Spatio-temporal analysis of the correlation between tweet volume and COVID-19 cases during the four periods of the pandemic, our answer to
RQ1 is that tweet volume and COVID-19 cases in GR and related countries are
correlated, but this strong correlation only exists during the Pre-peak period of
the pandemic. Regardless of the time at which R(t) peaks, there is a 5-6 day lead
between tweet volume and COVID-19 cases.
For the occurrence of this lead, we are tempted to consider whether this lead
hinges on the incubation period of COVID-19. Although the current research on
the incubation period of COVID-19 is inconclusive, several studies have suggested
that the incubation period of COVID-19 is on average 5-6 days [40, 41, 42]. In
this regard, we speculate that the 5-6 day lead may be related to the lag between
infection and the onset of symptoms to be detectable and confirmed.
For RQ2, we found significant differences in the topics about COVID-19 concerned by Twitter users from different regions. While initially, the main topic is
about China, the analysed region and countries reacted differently on the topic
after the first case emerged. In France, Germany, and Belgium, the first case did
not attract much attention to anti-contagious and treatment measures, policies and
local news, until a complete outbreak. Whileas GR, as a relational city with a
large number of cross-border workers, has shown high interest in policies since
the first case, even if no lockdown policy has been implemented at that time. At
the same time, Luxembourg, which has a foreign resident population of 47.4%,
has shown a great concern for policies including travel from the beginning of the
pandemic, which is not found in the other analysed countries.
22

We speculate that the reason for this can be explained by the fact that in these
countries there was not an immediate outbreak of the pandemic after the first
case, but rather after an interval of an average of 27.3 days. Thus, there may be an
underestimation of the severity of the pandemic by the public in these countries
during the Pre-peak period. We tentatively suggest that a possible explanation for
this phenomenon is optimism bias, which makes people believe their exposure risk
to disease is low [43]. During a pandemic, people often exhibit an optimism bias,
a cognitive bias that causes someone to believe that they will be less likely to get
involved in negative events [44]. Here, we offer a speculative interpretation that
even though these countries have shown sustained and long-term concern about
COVID-19 occurring in China on Twitter, optimism bias emerged when COVID19 appeared, causing the public to ignore the emergence of the cases and to pay
little attention on anti-contagious measures and government policies [45]. Further
analysis of this issue will be undertaken in future studies.
Our results in the current paper can be used to understand topics being discussed on Twitter, and the differences exhibited in GR, the relational city, when
facing the pandemic. At the same time, we make a speculative conclusion of the
ideal point of time to conduct the pandemic precaution advocacy which help to
provide policy support.
There are still some limitations of our study. First, in our dataset, we did not
detect misleading information posted by bots, which can lead to a possible bias in
topical modelling and classification.
For our initial exploration of topic categories, we chose SVM to build a baseline method for topic classification. We will utilise other state-of-the-art text classification methods to refine the classification in further study. Second, our case
study has some statistical limitations. Data from more countries will be included
in future studies to ensure the statistical significance of the conclusions.
Third, more research can be performed based on our dataset. For example,
in future, we will conduct sentiment analysis on the tweets of different categories
at each pandemic period to find out the changing in the public’s sentiment about
the pandemic and how it differs between GR and other countries. And for RQ2,
multi-class sentiment analysis with BERT will be conducted to figure out whether
and to what extent people are optimistic or pessimistic about being affected by
a pandemic during the Pre-peak period. Finally, during the writing of this article, the second wave of COVID-19 emerges in Luxembourg and other studied
countries. In a future study, we will conduct a comparative study focusing on the
regions that have the second wave. Sentiment analysis and text classification with
the state-of-the-art method will be deployed to investigate whether OSNs informa23

tion impact public attitude and behaviour. We will attempt to identify topics that
may help to predict the second wave, such as laxity or resistance to policies and
anti-infection measures. Such timely indicators are potentially useful for making
appropriate policy adjustments to avoid a new pandemic outbreak.
