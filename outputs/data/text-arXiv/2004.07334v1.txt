Abstract
This report provides a visual examination of Covid-19 case and death
data. In particular, it shows that country specific differences can too a
large extend be explained by two easily interpreted parameters. Namely,
the delay between reported cases and deaths and the fraction of cases
observed. Furthermore, this allows to lower bound the actual total number
of people already infected.

Introduction

The unfolding COVID-19 pandemic requires timely and finessed actions. Policy
makers around the globe are hard pressed to balance mitigation measures such
as social distancing and economic interests. While initial studies [3] predicted
millions of potential deaths never findings hint at a much more modest outcome
[8, 4]. Especially the case fatality rate (CFR) and the number of unobserved
infections are crucial to judge the state of the pandemic as well as the effectiveness of its mitigation. Yet, there estimates are plagued with high uncertainties
as exemplified in the quick revisions even from the same institution [3, 4]
Most studies are based on elaborate epidemic modeling either using stochastic or deterministic transmission dynamics. Especially, the susceptible-infectedrecovered (SIR) model [10] forms a basic building block and has been extended in
several directions in order to understand the dynamics of the ongoing Covid-19
pandemic [9, 2, 7, 13]. In this context, it has not only been compared with more
phenomenological growth models [12], e.g. logistic growth, but also been used
to quantify the effectiveness of quarantine and social distancing [9, 2]. E.g. social distancing, can be easily included by replacing the infection rate parameter
with a function allowing it to change over time. [2] assumes one or several (soft)
step functions where the infection rate drops in response to different measures
after these had been implemented.
Such detailed modeling is required in order to capture and forecast temporal
dynamics of the epidemic spreading. Yet, substantial care is needed as to which
parameters can be learned from the data and which cannot. Indeed, I show here
that SIR type models – and others exhibiting similarly flexible growth dynamics – are non-identified with respect to the CFR and the fraction of observed

infections. Instead, a direct visual exploration of the data leads to valuable
insights in this regard. In particular, much of the variability relating reported
case and death counts can be explained by two easily interpreted parameters.
Furthermore, based on three simple assumptions a lower bound on the number
of actual infections, including observed and unobserved cases, can be obtained.
In turn, confirming recent estimates without the need of complex and maybe
questionable modeling choices.

Data exploration

Covid-19 data are published by several sources, most notably the John Hopkins university and the European Center for Decease Prevention and Control
(ECDC). Here, data from ECDC as available from https://opendata.ecdc.
europa.eu/covid19/casedistribution/csv are used.
Figure 1 shows the total cumulative case and death counts of selected countries. These countries are among the eight most effected countries in terms of
absolute and relative deaths1 . In the following, I will focus on relative counts as
these are arguably more meaningful when comparing different countries – which
could differ widely in terms of population size.
Assumption 1. Death counts are more reliable than case counts.
By Assumption 1 analysis will start from relative cumulative death counts dt
in the following2 . Furthermore, in order to facilitate country comparisons, dates
are shifted relative to the first day that relative death counts exceed a threshold
θ of 1, 2, 4 or 8 deaths per million inhabitants respectively, i.e. t = 0 is defined
such that dt ≥ θ for t ≥ 0 and dt < θ for t < 0. Figure 2 shows the resulting
time course of relative case and death counts. Aligning dates in this fashion

quality.

shows that several countries exhibit similar time courses, e.g. Belgium and
Spain or China and South Korea. As shown in the supplementary Figure S1 the
remaining country specific differences can be explained by differences in growth
rates. Re-scaling time according to the estimated doubling time indeed leads
to a data collapse as complete as often observed in physical systems exhibiting
scaling laws [11].
Here, these differences in the precise temporal dynamics of epidemic growth
are not required. Instead, the relation between relative death and case counts
is considered. While relative death counts exhibit similar time courses the corresponding relative case counts ct are more variable when aligned in the same
fashion, i.e. relative to the first day that dt exceeds a given threshold. As
I will argue now, most of this variability can be explained with two readily
interpretable parameters.
Assumption 2. There is a well defined country specific delay between reported
cases and deaths.

Figure 3:
Estimated CFR cfrτ for Germany (left) and Italy (right) using
different delays of τ = 0, . . . , 11 days. Note that in each case, there exists a
characteristic delay such that estimates are almost constant over time. Further
note that estimates for all delays will eventually converge to the same final value
when enough data are available.
Figure 2 suggests that relative case counts are not aligned as some countries,
e.g. Germany, systematically lead the counts reported in other countries, e.g.
Italy. Such a difference could mean that individuals survive longer, e.g. due
to differences in medical care, until they eventually. It could also just reflect
reporting delays due to bureaucratic reasons. In any case, it is clearly the case
that individuals die not immediately, but some days after they had been tested
positive previously.

2.1

Case fatality rate

This delay also needs to be taken into account when estimating the case fatality
rate (CFR). Commonly the CFR is defined as cfr = dctt . Not surprisingly this
estimate is highly variable and changes systematically over time, especially at
the beginning of an epidemic. The observation captured in Assumption 2 also
explains the surprisingly low CFRs initially announced in Austria and Germany
where reported death counts are simply some days older compared to other
countries!
Thus, taking into account that individuals that had been tested positive will
usually not die on the same day but after some delay τ (if at all), I define
cfrτ =

dt
,
ct−τ

(1)

i.e. comparing current death with previous case counts.
Figure 3 shows the CFRs estimated for Germany and Italy in this fashion,
i.e. for different delays τ . The estimate using τ = 0 rises over time simply
reflecting that due to the reporting delay death counts have not yet caught
up with the exponentially growing case counts. Interestingly, for each country
there exists a characteristic delay at which the estimated CFRs are essentially
4

constant. Thus, reflecting the hypothesized delay between reported cases and
deaths.
This delay can either be estimated by visual inspection or by fitting a linear
model on each delay and picking the one with minimal absolute slope3 . Figure 3
shows the delays τ and corresponding CFRs cfrτ , i.e. the median CFR value
at this delay, estimated for each country in this fashion. In order to fully relate
the observed case with death counts an additional, and stronger, assumption is
needed.
Assumption 3. The true case fatality rate is the same for all countries.
While Assumption 3 ignores medical, demographic and other differences between countries, I believe it unlikely that the CFR is very different across different countries. In the end, its the same type of virus spreading in all countries.
This suggests that differences in estimated CFRs simply reflect differences in
the ability of countries to actually observe all infected individuals, i.e. due to
more or less effective tracking and testing procedures. To illustrate this effect,
a true CFR of 1% is assumed in the following. This is consistent with current
knowledge and had also been used in other studies [4]. Just from the estimated
values any CFR below the minimum of all estimates (about 2% found for Austria and South Korea) and above 0.1% (which would imply an observed fraction
above one for Belgium) is compatible with the data.
Figure 4 shows the country specific estimates of reporting delay, CFR and
fraction of observed cases (assuming a true CFR of 1%) obtained in this fashion.
In turn, Figure 5 shows the implied relative case counts when shifted by the
estimated delays and scaled to reflect the unobserved fraction of cases for each
country. Notably, these implied counts all align nearly as good as the death
counts in Figure 2 (right panel) even though the initial threshold was based
on the deaths counts alone. The supplementary Figure S2 shows that this
holds also when re-scaling time according to the growth rate of deaths. Overall,
the collapse of implied case dynamics convincingly illustrates that the relation
between case and death counts is fully and reliably captured by two parameters
– compatible with three reasonable assumptions.

Discussion

In reality, an additional delay between an infection and its corresponding positive test result can be assumed. Therefore, the fraction of observed cases will
be even lower than obtained by the analysis above. Unfortunately, assuming a
sufficiently flexible model for the growth of the actual cases already the CFR
and the fraction of observed cases, let alone an additional delay, are not jointly
identifiable.

3.1

Epidemic modeling

The basic SIR model [10], assumes that an infection unfolds when susceptible
(S) individuals become infected (I) – which in turn infect further susceptible
individuals. Finally, infected individuals recover (R) (or die) and are no longer

where N ≡ St + It + Rt is constant over time. Model parameters are

In this model, the average time of infection is γ −1 giving rise to a basic reproduction number of R0 = βγ −1 .
SIR models and extensions are widely used in epidemic modeling. The have
also been applied to the understand the dynamics of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic [9, 2, 7, 13]. In particular, models including the possibility of unobserved
cases or including a reporting delay have been developed. Within the SIR framework, both effects can be included in several ways, most easily by assuming that
observed cumulative infections are simply a fraction α ∈ [0, 1] of previous total infections It + Rt , i.e. α(It−τ + Rt−τ ). A more elaborate attempt instead
considers more detailed dynamics of the form

after an additional delay. In general, the infection rates βI , βO , βU could be
different for initial infections and observed vs unobserved cases4 .
In addition, mitigation measures, e.g. social distancing, can be easily included by assuming that β’s are functions of time. E.g. [2] assumes one or
several (soft) step functions where β drops after measures have been implemented. Unfortunately, as we show now a model including a time-varying β as
well as unobserved cases is not identifiable. For simplicity, consider the above
model with βI = βO = βU =: β. Then, new infections arise with intensity
β SNt (It + Ot + Ut ) which in turn translate into observed cases with intensity

to the much smaller change in St0 . Indeed, Figure 6 shows the dynamics of

β 0 (t) is approximated by the best-fitting logistic sigmoid of the form β1 + (β2 −
β1 )σ( t−τ
T ). Note that the number of observed cases is identical, just shifted
by τ , whereas the final fraction of susceptible individuals is vastly different.
Indeed, in the first case the epidemic is stopped by group immunity whereas
in the second case effective mitigation measures are imposed. Correspondingly,
police implications would be vastly different in the two situations even though
they are observationally indistinguishable.

3.2

Implications

Instead of detailed modeling of epidemic dynamics, which is further complicated
due policy actions requiring flexible models with delicately chosen parameters,
the present analysis is based on visual inspection of the reported data. Overall,
relative case and deaths counts (observed for country c) seem to be related as
5 Giving

rise to an R0 of 3.

follows:
dct = cfr · act−τ c
cct = αc · at
where acr denotes the actual infections a fraction αc ∈ [0, 1] is observed. A
suitable reporting delay τ c can be estimated by visual inspection of the data, but
again the fraction of observed cases αc and CFR cfr are not jointly identifiable
if there exist sets of parameters such that a0t−τ = αat , as is the case for dynamic
SIR type models. In the end, any epidemic modeling implicitly or explicitly
chooses a parametric form for the latent growth process at and will not be
identified if sufficiently flexible. Yet, assumption three of a constant CFR across
all countries allows to derive
1. a range of values consistent among all countries,
2. as well as recover the corresponding fraction of observed cases in each
country.
Thereby, assuming a reasonable true CFR value, i.e. from the model implied
range 0.1% to 2% which is also consistent with current knowledge, and using the
estimated delay, the actual case numbers can be reconstructed. Figure 7 shows
the resulting actual relative infection counts across several countries. Note that
despite the simplicity of this analysis, the estimated numbers compare favorable
[4]. Indeed, I would rather trust these even more as they do not rely on complex
modeling assumptions but follow from visual inspection of the data.
Overall, I have illustrated that much of the variability between observed
case and deaths counts between different countries can be explained by two
parameters. Namely, the reporting delay τ and the fraction of observed cases.
Especially the reporting delay exhibits crucial differences between countries and
needs to be taken into account when comparing data and planning actions. In
particular, containment is challenging when long incubation times are involved
[1] but a combination of case tracing and isolation policies could be effective
[5, 6]. Thus, detailed epidemic modeling is certainly needed in order to judge
the effectiveness of current mitigation measures across different countries [4, 2].
On the other hand, important parameters need to fixed based on additional
knowledge as they cannot be identified within sufficiently flexible models. In
the end, data analysis and detailed modeling alone only gets us only that far and
more extensive testing is urgently needed to obtain reliable knowledge about the
current progression of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Data collapse by re-scaling time

Aligning the data as in Figure 2 still shows country-specific differences in the
temporal course of epidemic spreading. Much of this difference can be attributed
to the speed at which the epidemic spreads in different countries. Estimating the

local growth rate of deaths d log

and country specific delays into account an almost complete data collapse for
the cases is obtained. Not that as in the main text, data are aligned according
to relative death counts only. Furthermore, the temporal re-scaling is based
on the estimated growth rate from the death counts as well. Yet, shifting and
scaling case data according to the estimated country specific delay and fraction
of observed cases leads to an almost complete data collapse as well.

NY Times style figures

As individual countries can be hard to identify in Figures 2 and 5, the NY Times
featured panel views where each country is highlighted above a background of
all countries. Here, I provide similar figures for relative death and case counts
using a threshold of two deaths per million inhabitants.

Uncertainty estimates from SIR model

Note that an SIR model already includes a natural delay between infections
and recovery (or death). Indeed, the total number of cases is given by Ct =
It + Rt while the cumulative death toll is obtained as cfrRt , i.e. modeling that
a fraction of individuals does not recover but dies instead. Assuming that only
a fraction α of cases is observed, the model is estimated with the following

Thus, observed daily changes are related to the model implement changes via an
over-dispersed Poisson aka negative binomial distribution. Figure S5 shows the
6
resulting estimates assuming βt = β1 + (β2 − β1 )σ( t−τ
T ) and cfr = 1% . The SIR
model assuming a single change point in the infectivity, via the logistic sigmoid
sigma(·) in βt reflecting the implementation of social distancing is clearly able to
capture the epidemic dynamics. Yet, parameter uncertainties, especially about
the reporting delay can be large7 .
Bayesian estimates have been carried out using Stan (full code available
from my https://github.com/bertschi/Covid repository) and using weakly
informative broad normal or student-t prior distributions on all parameters.

6 Due

to the non-identifiability derived in the main text either α or cfr needs to be fixed.
high uncertainty could also reflect that an SIR dynamics is misspecified in that it
corresponds to an exponential delay distribution. Such additional model assumptions need to
be carefully chosen in order to obtain meaningful parameter estimates.
