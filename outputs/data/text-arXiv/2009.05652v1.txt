Abstract
Cryptocurrency history begins in 2008 as a means of payment proposal. However, cryptocurrencies evolved into complex, high yield speculative assets. Contrary to traditional financial instruments, they are not (mostly) traded in organized, law-abiding venues, but on online
platforms, where anonymity reigns. This paper examines the long term memory in return and
volatility, using high frequency time series of eleven important coins. Our study covers the preCovid-19 and the subsequent pandemia period. We use a recently developed method, based on
the wavelet transform, which provides more robust estimators of the Hurst exponent. We detect
that, during the peak of Covid-19 pandemic (around March 2020), the long memory of returns
was only mildly affected. However, volatility suffered a temporary impact in its long range
correlation structure. Our results could be of interest for both academics and practitioners.

Introduction

Cryptocurrencies have become one of the most traded financial assets in the last decade. In order to
put their importance into perspective, two of the most important stock exchanges in the world, the
New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, report an average of $30 billions and $85 billions in daily
volume, respectively. Over the last six months, daily transactions of cryptocurrencies varied between
$5 bilions and $31 billions, depending on the day. As a consequence, cryptocurrencies have been
receiving increasing interest from both academics and practitioners. As a new object of study, it
poses several challenges. One of them is to examine the statistical properties of the price generating
process. According to the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), the price of any speculative asset
must convey all available information [23]. In particular, the weak version of the EMH states that
the current price includes all the information contained in the series of past prices. As a consequence
of the non-arbitrage possibility, price returns time series should follow a random process with no
memory. In particular, it is excluded the possibility of long-term memory, as it could allow for
profitable trading strategies.
The EMH, specially regarding the presence of long-term memory has been subject to debate
since the work by Mandelbrot [35]. It has been extensively studied in developed and emerging stock

rates [41, 48, 51], among other financial time series.
Studies related to cryptocurrencies are much more recent. Specially on these days it is relevant
to investigate how markets react to such a global event as Covid-19 pandemic.
Early papers studying the informational efficiency of Bitcoin time series [49, 42] find that the
returns (and some power transformations) had been informational inefficiency, but the also report a
trend toward a more efficient behavior. Shortly after these papers, [8] confirms the diminishing memory in daily returns, along with a highly persistent component in daily volatility. Such persistence
justifies the use of GARCH-type models in volatility, as proposed by [32, 33].
One-time-only events such as a hughe price crash or a pandemic, could alter the stochastic
process governing returns and volatilities. In this line, [15] finds that before the big price crash of
2013, Bitcoin volatility was asymmetric1 in the opposite way of the traditional assets, whereas this
asymmetry is not found after the price crash. Similarly, a global event such as Covid-19 pandemic,
could have non-trivial effects on volatility and returns. Consequently, it begins to be an area of
interest for researchers. For example, [19] reports significant growth in both returns and volumes
traded in large cryptocurrencies, and [26] affirms that levels of Covid-19 caused a rise in Bitcoin
prices.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) [50], Covid-19 pandemic originates in the
People’s Republic of China. On December 31st, WHO’s country office gathers information issued by
the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reporting cases of ‘viral pneumonia’. At the beginning,
the virus seemed to be circumscribed to that region. On January 24th. France informed of some
cases from people who had been in the Wuhan region, constituting the first confirmed cases in
Europe. However, infections and deaths associated to Covid-19 remained at relatively very low
levels during January and February. As displayed in Figure 1, daily number of infected and dead
people in Europe rocketed in March, and showed a diminishing trend by the end of that month.
Europe has been the first region (after the inception in China) to suffer the pandemic, with its most
deadly effect concentrated in a short time frame. Consequently, we would like to investigate if such
a sudden public health problem has had an impact on the cryptocurrency market.
In this line, the aim of this paper is to study the long memory profiles of returns and volatilities
of eleven cryptocurrencies, during a period spanning before and after the inception of the pandemic
event. We contribute to the literature in multiple ways: (i) we propose a new method that has not
been applied before to compute the Hurst exponent in cryptocurrencies time series; (ii) we study a
set of the eleven most important cryptoassets at high frequency; (iii) we discuss the effect of Covid-19
pandemic on returns and volatilities.
This remaining of the article is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the methodology used
in the paper; Section 3 describes the data used and discusses the empirical findings; and Section 4
concludes.

Methods

Harold Edwin Hurst was a British engineer, whose name is intrinsically connected to the study of
long range dependence in time series. His original method was presented in a series of papers in
the 1950s [28, 29, 30, 31]. Although it was originally formulated for the resolution of an specific
hydrological problem, it turned out to have more universal applications in the field of time series
analysis. The Hurst exponent describes the persistent or anti-persistent character of a time series,
arising from its long-range memory.
The presence of long-range memory is compatible with the fractional Brownian motion model
postulated in [37, 38]. It was precisely Benoit Mandelbrot [36] who proposed in the early 1970s the
1 Assymetry in volatility means that the reaction of volatility to unexpected positive and negative changes is not
the same.

use of the fractional Brownian motion model in economics [35]. In a series of papers Mandelbrot and
coworkers propose a generalization of the standard Brownian motion, which allows for the presence
of long memory [37, 38, 39].
Undoubtedly, finding an accurate measure of long range dependence is a desirable goal in time
series analysis. The original R/S method developed by Hurst, has some drawbacks, as it is biased towards finding spurious long memory. This situation triggered the development of alternative
methods (e.g. aggregated variance approach [14], Higuchi method [27], Detrended Fluctuation Analysis [44], etc.) to find better estimators for long-range dependence. The review conducted in [46]
provides a comprehensive guide for the proper use of the different methods according to the signal
characteristics.
Previous works acknowledges that, for an arbitrary artificial time series, the wavelet method does
not only find a more accurate H value than the R/S method, but also that it is not necessary to
assess a priori the series stationarity [46]. Consequently, in this work we use a wavelet-based method
to estimate the Hurst exponent.
The continuous wavelet transform allows to decompose the time series in the time-frequency
domain, and is defined as:


Z ∞
s−b
1
f (s)ψ
ds for a > 0
(1)
Wψ f (a, b) = √
a
a −∞
where a is the scale parameter, b is the shift parameter and ψ is the mother wavelet. Hereinafter,
we will refer to this equation as Wa,b .
If the time series has H−self-affinity, i.e. if the time series satisfies a power law of the kind
X(ct) ≈ cH X(t), the variance of the wavelet transform (Eq. (1)) will be asymptotically affected by
a scale parameter:
V ar(a) = E(Wa,b )2 − (E(Wa,b ))2 ≈ aβ
(2)
where β ∈ [−1, 3]. [34] find a relationship between H and β for self-affine series. Consequently, the
Hurst exponent is defined as:
• H=

β+1
2 ,

with β ∈ [−1, 1), if the signal is a fGn,

• H=

β−1
2 ,

with β ∈ [1, 3], if the signal is a fBm,

where fBm stands for fractional Brownian motion, and fGn for fractional Gaussian noise.
The wavelet method used in this paper is a modification of the AWC method developed in [47],
who propose the following steps:
1. Apply the wavelet transform of the data in the wavelet domain, Wa,b ;
2. Compute, for a fixed scale, a, the average wavelet coefficients;
3. Draw the log-log plot of coefficients vs. scale a.
The key improvement presented in [4] consists in the use of more robust estimators for the
computation of the coefficients required in step 2, compared to the estimators used in [47].
Based on Eq. (1), it is proposed to estimate the coefficients of the variance of the time series
using two estimators. The first one is the well-known unbiased variance estimator Vd
ar, which given
a set of data x1 , . . . , xm is defined as:
m

Vd
ar(x) =

1 X
(xi − x̄)2
m − 1 i=1

4

(3)

The second one is the median absolute deviation (MAD), which is a more robust estimator of the
variance (see [40]):
M AD(Wa,b ) = M ed(|Wa,b − M ed(Wa,b )|)
(4)
where M ed(·) is the median operator. This improved method will be referred, hereinafter, as AWCMAD. In [4] AWC-MAD was benchmarked against the classical R/S method and competing alternatives for averaging wavelet coefficients. In all cases AWC-MAD estimations of the Hurst exponent
were closer to the theoretical Hurst exponent in synthetic series with 32768 datapoints. Subsequently,
[5, 6, 7] compare R/S and AWC-MAD methods for climate time series as well as for synthetic time
series.
Considering that the main goal of this paper is to study long range dependence in the cryptocurrency market, with shorter time series, we benchmark theoretical and estimated Hurst exponent on
fBm and fGn sinthetic series with 1435 datapoints. We generate rolling windows of 500 observations,
moving forward one observation in each window. The algorithm to generate the artificial series was
proposed by [1], and implemented in MatLab with the function wfbm.m, using Daubechies wavelet
of order 10. Results displayed in Table 1. The first column is the theoretical Hurst exponent value,
and the other columns display the mean and standard deviation of the estimations computed on all
the rolling windows with the AWC-MAD.

Data and empirical results

Cryptocurrencies are traded in online platforms that are not compelled to abide by national financial
regulations. Thus, a careful selection of a reliable data source is crucial for the validity of results.
Following [2] and [9], we downloaded data from [21]. We use high frequency (every two hour)
price data of eleven important cryptocurrencies in terms of to traded volume. The period under
examination goes from 14/11/2019 to 08/06/2020, for a total of 2496 observations. We studied
two-hour returns and volatility. Considering that there are several ways of capturing volatility in
financial markets, we selected two widely used proxies [24, 3, 20]. Additionally, in order to take into
account the dynamic character of the market, we compute the Hurst exponents by means of rolling
windows. Each rolling window cointains 360 datapoints (30 trading days). Each window moves one
observation forward, and deletes the first observation. Data covers the period that lies before and
after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Namely, we compute the following measures from the
price time series:
• Logarithmic or continuously compounded return:
Rt = log(Pt ) − log(Pt−1 )
where Pt and Pt−1 are two consecutive closing prices every two hours.

5

(5)

• Max-Min volatility:

V oltM inM ax = log(Ptmax ) − log(Ptmin )

(6)

where Ptmax and Ptmin the maximum and minimum prices observed in a two-hour period.
• Absolute return volatility:
V oltAbs = abs(log(Pt ) − log(Pt−1 ))

(7)

We obtained important results regarding long memory in returns and in volatility. With respect
to returns, as can be appreciated in Figure 2, the effect of Covid-19 on the Hurst exponent is mild.
The average Hurst exponent around 0.5, which is similar to previous findings for time series at low
and high frequency sampling [8, 12]. Table 2 displays the mean Hurst exponent of each return time
series, for all windows, windows before 03/03/2020, windows during two weeks in March when there
was a peak in the pandemic, and windows after 18/03/2020. We observe that between March 3rd.
and March 18th. the Hurst exponents are greater than in the preceding period, but they recover
previous levels soon after this date.
A different picture is obtained when we analyze volatility. There has been a striking effect of
Covid-19 on the long-term memory of volatility. This paper uses two proxies for volatility. The
first one, is the Max-Min volatility, and the dynamic evolution of its Hurst exponent is displayed
in Figure 3. Considering that this way of measuring volatility uses the highest and lowest price
of a given cryptocurrency within a two-hour period, it is suitable to capture extreme events. In
Table 3 we observe that the period that goes from November to the early March exhibits very
highly persistence (Hurst exponent greater than 0.69). On the contrary, between March 3rd. and
March 18th. the Hurst exponents drop suddendly, reflecting an antipersistent time series. This
situation could reflect a moment of market panic, where large positive returns are followed by large
negative returns and vice versa. We should recall that during these days stocks markets around the
world were in free fall (for example, the German DAX index plunged by 26%). Cryptocurrencies,
as alternative assets, were subject to speculative moves, and those large swings in volatilities could
reflect the uncertainty around the true value and feasibility of cryptocurrencies as a safe haven amid
the pandemic. After March 18th. the Hurst values reversed to values above 0.7, returning volatility
into a highly persisting process.
Absolute returns have been proposed to measure financial time series volatility. Similar to MaxMin volatility, absolute returns also exhibit a persistent behavior during the period before March.
However, and at odds with the previous proxy, absolute returns increased in their persistence during
the upheaval of the Covid-19 crisis (See Figure 4 and Table 4).
These two apparently contradictory findings could be reconciled as follows. First, there is undoubtedly a strong Covid-19 effect on volatility, as both proxies reflect strong changes in their Hurst
exponents. Second, Max-Min and absolute returns measure different aspects of volatility. The former is more sensible to extreme events, considers only the positive side of volatility, and measures
the range of prices during a given hour. The latter, conversely, considers both positive and negative
changes as single absolute returns, being less sensitive to extreme events. Analyzing both results
jointly, we can conclude that hours with large price swings were followed by hours with smaller price
swings during the worst days of the pandemic. However, two-hour returns were more persistent
during the same period. After March 18th. extreme events (as measured by Max-Min volatility)
became again to be highly persistent, along with a persistence (albeit to a lesser extent) of absolute
returns.

Conclusions

This paper’s contribution is twofold. On the one hand, it applies a new, improved, wavelet-based
method to compute the Hurst exponent. On the other hand, it provides an analysis of high frequency

return and volatility of eleven cryptocurrencies during Covid-19 pandemic. We find that, even though
the ongoing pandemic has produced only a mild effect on the long-range memory of cryptocurrency
returns, it imprinted a strong transitory effect on volatility. We use two alternative measures of
return volatility: Max-Min and absolute returns. Both proxies reflect a significant change in their
long memory profile. Regarding Max-Min, we observe a momentary swap, from a highly persistent
process to an antipersistent one. Differently, absolute returns time series suffer a reinforcement
in their persistent behavior during the upheaval of the pandemic. The divergent reaction of both
volatility measures could be explained by the sensibility of the Max-Min measure to more extreme
events, as it only measures positive changes (V oltM inM ax = log(Ptmax ) − log(Ptmin )). The Hurst
exponent of both volatility proxies return to levels previous to the Covid-19 pandemic, after March
18th. Thus, we conclude that this one-time-only event has had only a transitory effect on the long
memory profile of returns and volatilities.
