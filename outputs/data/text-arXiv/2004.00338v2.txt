Abstract.
In this study, the problem of automatically classifying pulmonary diseases,
including the recently emerged COVID-19, from X-Ray images, is considered.
While the spread of COVID-19 is increased, new, automatic, and reliable
methods for accurate detection are essential to reduce the exposure of the medical
experts to the outbreak. X-Ray imaging, although limited to specific
visualizations, may be helpful for the diagnosis. Deep Learning has proven to be
a remarkable method to extract massive high-dimensional features from medical
images. Specifically, in this paper, the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural
Network called Mobile Net is employed and trained from scratch to investigate
the importance of the extracted features for the classification task. A large-scale
dataset of 3905 X-Ray images, corresponding to 6 diseases is utilized for training
MobileNet v2, which has been proven to achieve remarkable results in related
tasks. The results suggest that training CNNs from scratch may reveal vital
biomarkers related but not limited to the COVID-19 disease, while an overall
classification accuracy of the seven classes reaches 87.66%. Besides, this method
achieves 99.18% accuracy, 97.36% Sensitivity, and 99.42% Specificity in the
detection of COVID-19.

Introduction

The Coronavirus (COVID-19) is perhaps the greatest challenge of mankind in
the 21st century. The development of the disease, its transmission, and the increased
mortality in a number of countries, make it imperative to develop treatment, but also to
protect health care and society from the transmission of the disease.
Therefore, remote control of the disease, including diagnosis, early quarantine,
and follow-up, is imperative. Artificial intelligence can contribute to the above
perspectives. Recent studies claim to achieve remarkable results regarding the
automatic detection of the disease from thoracic X-Ray scans [1-3]. Although the
research is limited due to the absence of large scale image data, the first results are
encouraging and necessitate further investigation and research.
Although the diagnosis is increasingly becoming a rapid process, the financial issues
arising from the cost of diagnostic tests concern both states and patients, especially in
countries with private health systems, or restricted access health systems due to
prohibitive prices.
During the last months, there has been an increase in publicly available patient data,
including X-Ray images. Possible patterns and knowledge mined from the X-Ray scans
may constitute a possible pipeline for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
Τhe development of deep learning applications over the last five years enable the
researchers to perform a rapid and deep analysis on the X-Ray scans. Deep Learning is
a combination of Machine Learning methods mainly focused on the automatic feature
extraction and classification from images, while its applications are broadly met in

3

medical image detection, segmentation, and classification tasks. Machine learning and
Deep Learning have become established disciplines in applying artificial intelligence
to mine, analyze, and recognize patterns from data. Reclaiming the advances of those
fields to the benefit of clinical decision making and computer-aided systems is
increasingly becoming nontrivial, as new data emerge [4].
Deep Learning is a learning method wherein deep Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN) are utilized for automatic mass feature extraction, achieved by the process called
convolution [5]. Each layer involves a transformation of the data into a higher and more
abstract level. Higher layers (i.e., deep layers) of portrayal enhance parts of the
information that are significant for segregation and smother unimportant attributes. Due
to the unlimited parameters mined during this process, several methods have been
proposed to achieve dimensionality reduction, such as Pooling [5].
Motivated by the recent and relative research, in this study, we focus on
circumventing two vital issues arisen in the detection of COVID-19 from X-Ray scans.
The first issue is related to the methodology of the experimental setups. In essence, the
researches have demonstrated that the detection of COVID-19 is achievable, but this
conclusion derives from an analysis based on incomplete data. Τhe models proposed
are powerful in classifying images between only three classes (viral and bacterial
pneumonia, COVID-19, normal). This, unfortunately, does not in demonstrated the
existence of a clear fingerprint of the Coronavirus in the X-Ray images, firstly due to
the insignificant database size, and secondly due to the fact that the fingerprints of other
pulmonary diseases have not been compared. The second issue is related to the flaws
of Deep Learning and is often referred to as the issue of interpretability [6]. In short,
the algorithm is not transparent, thereby a radiologist cannot supervise and know which
factors or indices the model was based on to predict.
To further evaluate the methodology of Deep Learning, we perform an experiment
utilizing six of the most common pulmonary diseases, including the COVID-19. In this
way, the capabilities of the method in distinguishing between the various diseases is
evaluated. Besides, the dataset of the particular experiment is significant, including
approximately 450 cases of COVID-19. To contribute to the latter referred issue (i.e.,
the interpretability), we perform three different experiments altering the mining
methods to inspect the variance of the extracted features. Specifically, the state-of-theart CNN called Mobile Net (v2) is employed to extract features from the images in three
different ways, as follows: a) training from scratch, b) feature extraction via transfer
learning (or of-the-self-features), and c) hybrid feature extraction via fine-tuning. Those
methods are explained in Section 2.2.
Due to the absence of a complete X-Ray dataset containing not only common
pneumonia or other diseases, but also cases of diagnosed COVID-19, the final dataset
of this experiment is a combination of X-Rays corresponding to common pulmonary
diseases recorded during the last years and confirmed COVID-19 cases recorded the
last months.
The results of the present research further enhance the research to date. In particular,
it is highlighted that with the strategy of training from scratch, the CNN succeeds in
mining significant image features, discovered solely in the particular X-Ray images.
Based on these characteristics (features), 88% accuracy in classification of the relative

4

diseases and ~ 99% accuracy in diagnosis of COVID is achieved. This may prove that
these features are Biomarkers and need further analysis, as they may be gene or other
signatures.

Methods
2.1

2.1.1

Dataset of the study
COVID-19 X-Ray images

For the creation of the dataset, the research focused on obtaining X-Rays
corresponding to confirmed cases infected by the virus SARS-COV-2. Through
extensive research, a collection of 455 well-visualized, confirmed pathological X-Ray
images was created. The final collection includes selected X-Rays from a Github
repository created by Dr. Cohen [7], and publically available medical image
repositories, such as the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), Radiopaedia,
and the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM). The latter
association released a publically available COVID-19 dataset [8], which was also
incorporated.
2.1.2 Common Bacterial and Viral Pneumonia X-Ray images
To train and evaluate the classification method in more complex conditions, a
collection of conventional bacterial and viral pneumonia X-Ray scans was added to the
dataset. This collection is available on the Internet by Kermany et al. [9]. A selection
of 910 related X-Ray images was incorporated into the dataset.
2.1.3 Pulmonary diseases detected from X-Ray scans
It is impossible to investigate the performance of any classification method in
detecting the COVID-19 disease unless other pulmonary diseases are incorporated. For
this reason, the final dataset includes selected X-Ray scans corresponding to other
pulmonary abnormalities.
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) X-Ray dataset was exploited, which
is referred to as NIH dataset for the particular experiment, and comprises 112.120
frontal-view X-ray images of 30.805 unique patients with the text-mined fourteen
disease image labels [10].
Those images are extracted from the clinical PACS database at the National
Institutes of Health Clinical Center in America. The corresponding diseases were mined
from the associated radiological reports using natural language processing. The labels
contain fourteen common thoracic pathologies include Atelectasis, Consolidation,
Infiltration, Pneumothorax, Edema, Emphysema, Fibrosis, Effusion, Pneumonia,

5

Pleural thickening, Cardiomegaly, Nodule, Mass and Hernia. This dataset is
significantly more representative of the real patient population distributions and
realistic clinical diagnosis challenges, than any previous chest X-Ray datasets. The
dataset comes with annotated metadata info, consisting of several risk associated
factors.
A significant limitation of this dataset is the labeling policy, which may raise
some concerns. More specifically, the medical reports were analyzed by an automatic
text-mining model, which assigned the corresponding labels according to its textmining procedure. However, as the authors claim, "there would be some erroneous
labels, but the Natural Language Processing (NLP) labeling accuracy is estimated to be
>90%" [10].
For the particular experiment, the following disease cases were selected: a)
Pulmonary Edema, b) Pleural effusion, c) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, d)
Pulmonary fibrosis. The selection was based on the significance and frequency of those
diseases. Analytically, 293 images representing the Pulmonary Edema, 311 images
representing the Pleural Effusion, 315 images representing the Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and 280 images representing the Pulmonary Fibrosis were
randomly chosen from the collection.
2.1.4 Image Pre-Processing and Data Augmentation
The X-Ray images were rescaled to a size of 200x200. For the images of different
pixel ratios, and to avoid distortion, black background of 200x200 pixels was added to
achieve a complete transformation. Low contrast images or images containing parts of
the whole thoracic X-Ray scan were excluded.
During the training process, slight augmentations were applied to the images. Data
augmentation is mandatory to generate the necessary diversity aiding to the
generalization capabilities of the CNNs [11]. Specifically, the images are randomly
rotated by a maximum of 10o and randomly shifted horizontally or vertically by a
maximum of 20 pixels towards any direction. In this way, the CNN learns to be robust
to position and orientation variance.
2.1.5 Data Limitations
The present collection of data faces some limitations, which have to be mentioned.
Firstly, a relatively small sample of COVID-19-infected cases is incorporated. Besides,
this sample may derive from patient cases with severe symptoms, the analysis of which
was mandatory. Cases with slight symptoms are missing from the current public
collections, which is due to the policy of protecting people (and society) who have mild
symptoms of the disease, and are immediately quarantined without further examination.
Secondly, the pneumonia incidence samples are older recorded samples and do not
represent pneumonia images from patients with suspected Coronavirus symptoms,
while the clinical conditions are missing.

6

Thirdly, further data related to demographic characteristics and other potential
predisposing or risk factors are not available, and this impedes a holistic approach and
examination beyond the medical image.
2.2

Learning Strategies for Feature Extraction

There are currently major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical
image classification, by extracting features, as follows: a) training the CNN from
scratch, b) employing a pre-trained CNN, which is called Transfer Learning [12], and
c) a hybrid method, which also a Transfer Learning method, and adopts the former
strategies by tuning the trainability of specific layers of the CNN; this method is called
Fine-Tuning [13].
The first strategy may be adopted either by developing a novel CNN architecture, or
by employing the architecture of a successful CNN. In this study, we employ a stateof-the-art CNN architecture, to follow each of the strategies.
The second and the third strategy are means of Transfer Learning. Transfer learning
is a machine learning method wherein a model developed for a specific task is reused
for another task. There are two categories to perform the Transfer Learning, i.e. the ofthe-self feature extraction and Fine-Tuning.
The off-the-self strategy is an approach utilizing the weights of the Convolutional
layers, which are defined from the source task (the initial training of another domain)
without re-training the network [14]. Extracting such features is usually fast and this
approach requires only the addition of a classifier to perform the classification of those
features with respect to their significance in the particular task.
The Fine-Tuning strategy involves utilizing a network initialized with pre-trained
weights and partially re-training it on the target task. In the context of deep learning,
fine-tuning a deep network is a common strategy to learn both task-specific deep
features, and retain the methodology to extract global features met in every image, such
as shapes. Usually, the Fine-Tuning strategy allows more trainable weights at the top
of the network (i.e., the final steps), due to the fact that those convolutional layers
extract more abstract and high-level information, compared to the first layers wherein
local features are learned. In the particular experiment, we gradually allow more layers
to be trainable, by defining 6 experimental cases, referred to as Fine-Tuning (e.g., 11),
where the number in the parenthesis corresponds to the number of trainable
convolutional blocks.
2.3
2.3.1

Method for the extraction of possibly significant biomarkers
The state-of-the-art CNN called Mobile Net

For the classification task, the state-of-the-art CNN called Mobile Net [15] was
employed. Mobile Net has been recently utilized for the same classification task by
Apostolopoulos [13]. In their work, the authors demonstrated the superiority of Mobile
Net in reducing the False Negatives for the detection of COVID-19, compared to other

7

famous CNNs. Besides, this CNN introduces a fewer number of parameters compared
to other CNNs, which makes it appropriate for swift training.
The MobileNet [15] model is based on depthwise separable convolutions [16],
which is a form of convolutions transforming a conventional convolution into a
depthwise convolution [16] and a 1x1 convolution, which is commonly known
pointwise convolution [16]. This procedure reduces the number of parameters
drastically.
To the top of the Mobile Net v2, a Global Average Pooling [17] layer was added,
which drastically reduces the issue of overfitting [18]. The extracted image features are
inserted into a Neural Network of 2500 nodes to distinguish between the irrelevant and
the significant ones. To further aid to the overfitting reduction, the weights of each
feature are normalized utilizing a Batch Normalization layer [19], while we
independently zero out the 50% of the outputs of neurons at random, via a Dropout
layer [20]. An overview of the method is illustrated in Figure 1.
The intention of the particular study is not only to achieve a high classification
accuracy but to achieve this by training the CNN from scratch. This strategy is
preferable to transfer learning to evaluate the significance of the features extracted from
the precise images, while not depending on features already learned by the pre-trained
model, the initial training of which was performed utilizing non-medical images.
Based on the results, the extracted features may be evaluated to conclude that they
may constitute real biomarkers related to various diseases.

2.4

Experiment Setup

We performed a set of three different experiments employing the same CNN
(Mobile Net v2) but altering the learning strategy. The following strategies are
evaluated: a) Transfer Learning with of-the-self features, b) Transfer Learning with
Fine-Tuning, and c) Training from scratch, which, in this experiment, is a latent form
of the Transfer Learning, since we only borrow the architecture of the Mobile Net and
not the learned parameters. The experiments were performed utilizing a single GPU

8

setup (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Super) using the Keras library [21] and
TensorFlow [22] as backend.
The training and evaluation procedure was performed with 10-fold-crossvalidation. During this procedure, the dataset is randomly split to ten folds, nine of
which are utilized for training the model, and the remaining fold is hidden and used to
test the performance and the confidence of the predictions after the training. This
process is repeated in a way that every fold is utilized as the test set. This increases the
computational cost but enhances the significance of the result. The final accuracy is
obtained by calculating the mean accuracy derived from each testing fold.

2.5

Metrics

The metrics, based upon which the evaluation of the performance is made, are the
overall 7-class accuracy, and the accuracy corresponding to the 2-class classification
(COVID-19 vs. non-COVID-19).
Besides, to focus on the performance of COVID-19 detection, the following values
are recorded: a) Correctly predicted COVID-19 cases (True Positives), b) Correctly
predicted non-COVID-19 cases (True Negatives), c) Incorrectly predicted COVID-19
cases (False Positives), and d) Incorrectly predicted non- COVID-19 cases (False
Negatives). Based on those values, the Sensitivity and Specificity of the test are
calculated by the following equations:
𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦 =

𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠
(1)
𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠 + 𝐹𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒 𝑁𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠

𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 =

𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒 𝑁𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠
(2)
𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒 𝑁𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠 + 𝐹𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠

For the particular experiments and given that there is a class imbalance issue, the
most reliable metric is that of the 7-class accuracy, while given that this accuracy is
high, the second most vital metric is that of Specificity. This is due to the importance
of correctly identifying the actual non-COVID-19 cases (True Negatives).

Results

In this section, the results for the different experiment setups are presented. Based
on those results, the optimal strategy is selected, and assumptions are made regarding
its effectiveness.
3.1. Results of the Of-the-Self-features strategy
In Table 1, the accuracy, sensitivity, and Specificity of the first strategy are given.
The reader should recall that the 2-class accuracy refers to the case where the labels are

9

"COVID-19" and "Non-COVID-19". Besides, the sensitivity and the Specificity refer
to the 2-class measurement.

Due to the class imbalance, the metric of Specificity was approaching 100% and was
not mentioned in Table 1, as it is not a meaningful measurement when reaching those
values. The same issue is valid for the 2-class accuracy but was mentioned in Table 1
for comparisons. The confusion matrix for each class is presented in Table 2.

Based on the results, it is confirmed that the particular strategy is not effective
in extracting useful features to distinguish possible underlying information from the XRays related to the COVID-19 disease. Besides, a bias towards the non-COVID-19
cases is observed in Table 3, which makes the strategy not appropriate for the particular
task.

3.2. Results of the Fine-Tuning strategy
In Table 4, the accuracy, the Sensitivity, and the Specificity of the second strategy
are given. The reader should recall that several adjustments for fine-tuning are tested in
the particular section, which are discussed in Section 2.2. The number defining each
experimental case, refers to the number of blocks made trainable during the experiment,
e.g., "Fine-Tuning 3" corresponds to 3 trainable blocks starting from the top of the
CNN. The reader should also recall that the values for the accuracy are the mean values
of the accuracies obtained at each fold from the 10-fold-cross-validation procedure.

As it is observed in Table 4, the strategy of fine-tuning obtains different results. This
is explained by the fact that we gradually allow more layers to be trainable, thus
approaching close to the strategy of training from scratch, which obtains the best
results, as it is presented in Section 3.3. Hence, the confusion matrixes are not provided
due to insignificance and limitations of space.
3.3. Results of the Training-from-scratch strategy
In Table 5, the accuracy, Sensitivity, and Specificity of the specific strategy are
presented.

In Table 5, it is observed that training from scratch outperforms the other strategies
in terms of every metric, obtaining a remarkable 2-class accuracy of 99.18% and a high
7-class accuracy of 86.66%. The reader should recall that 2-class accuracy refers to the
effectiveness of distinguishing the COVID-19 cases from every other case, including

11

both abnormal and normal cases. In Table 6, the confusion matrix for the 7-class task
is presented.

Several outcomes are to be highlighted in Table 6. Firstly, out of 455 COVID-19
cases, 443 cases were correctly identified, while only 2 cases were mistakenly classified
as normal. Secondly, out of the 1341 normal cases, only 1 case was mistakenly
identified. For the rest of the pulmonary abnormalities, there is a diversity, which may
derive from the fact that the different pathogens embody seals that are difficult to
distinguish from the X-Rays and confuse the CNN.
The confusion matrix corresponding to the COVID-19 class vs. all the classes is
presented in Table 7.

Discussion

The particular research focuses on discovering possible biomarkers from X-Ray
images. These biomarkers may be significantly related to the COVID-19 disease.
While Deep Learning extracts a massive amount of high-dimensional features
from images, it is possible that some of those features behave as actual biomarkers. The
reader may be confused by the difference between a feature and a biomarker. Therefore
we briefly describe the difference between them. A feature is a specific characteristic

12

of an image, either well-defined in the literature or yet to be defined as to its importance.
With Deep Learning, it is possible to extract millions of related features. The extracted
features' importance to the specific task is questionable. The majority of those features
may be irrelevant to the desired outcome, or the desired subject of study and are rejected
by the automatic classification performed after the convolutional layers of a CNN. The
biomarkers are quantitative markers of confirmed significance and are not limited to
the image features [23]. Generally, the ability of Deep Learning for biomarker
extraction is questionable due to the issue of the interpretability.
This study suggests that it may be possible to discover new reliable biomarkers from
X-Ray images due to the fact that a high classification accuracy was achieved. Since
the CNNs and the Neural Networks lay on the evaluation of millions of parameters to
classify the significant features, some of those features may actually be biomarkers
leading to a reliable result. This horizon in to be investigated in future research, possibly
exploring other approaches, such as Radiomics [24].
Οne factor that underpins the conclusion mentioned above is the comparison
between the various image feature mining strategies. In particular, it is demonstrated
that those strategies do not mine the same features. This can be easily interpreted, since
with strategies of Transfer Learning with of-the-self-features and Transfer Learning
with fine-tuning, the ability of the CNN to extract significant features depends on
factors related to the initial training. The initial training was mandatory to be performed
on images of a completely different nature due to the absence of large-scale data.
However, despite the fact that the latter strategies have excellent performances in other
medical image classification tasks [12], [25], in the particular experiment, they were
underperforming. This may suggest that with the training from scratch, essential
features related to the pulmonary abnormalities have been mined, which may constitute
relevant Biomarkers.
In future studies, some issues of the present study can be circumvented. A more indepth analysis, in particular, requires much more patient data, particularly those
suffering from COVID-19.
A more promising approach for future studies would concentrate on identifying
patients infected by COVID-19, but showing mild symptoms, although those symptoms
may not be visualized correctly on x-rays, or may not be visualized at all.
It is of vital importance to establish models capable of distinguishing between a more
significant number of pulmonary diseases, possibly including that of SARS. Also,
despite the fact that the appropriate treatment is not determined solely from an X-Ray
image [26], an initial screening of the cases would be useful, not in the type of
treatment, but in the timely application of quarantine measures in the positive samples,
until a complete examination and specific treatment or follow-up procedure are
followed.

Conclusion

The contribution of this work is two-fold. Firstly, low-cost, rapid, and automatic
detection of the COVID-19 disease was achieved, utilizing a significantly large sample

13

of several pulmonary infections. Secondly, the study suggests that future research
should be conducted to investigate the possible behavior of the extracted feature as
Biomarkers since there is sufficient evidence, based on the particular results. Besides,
the advantage of automatic detection of COVID-19 from either medical image lies in
the reduction of exposure of nursing and medical staff to the outbreak.
