Abstract
On the basis of a compartment model, the epidemic curve is investigated when the net
rate λ of change of the number of infected individuals I is given by an ellipse in the λ-I
plane which is supported in [Iℓ , Ih ]. With a ≡ (Ih − Iℓ )/(Ih + Iℓ ), it is shown that (1) when
a < 1 or Iℓ > 0, oscillation of the infection curve is self-organized and the period of the
oscillation
is in proportion to the ratio of the difference (Ih − Iℓ ) and the geometric mean
√
Ih Iℓ of Ih and Iℓ , (2) when a = 1, the infection curve shows a critical behavior where it
decays obeying a power law function with exponent −2 in the long time limit after a peak,
and (3) when a > 1, the infection curve decays exponentially in the long time limit after a
peak. The present result indicates that the pandemic can be controlled by a measure which
makes Iℓ < 0.

1 Introduction
Since the first outbreak in China in November 2019, COVID-19 has been spreading in all continents including Antarctica. According to a recent analysis of infection status of 186 countries
1

[1, 2], the time dependence of the daily confirmed new cases in more than 80 countries show
oscillations whose periods range from one to five months depending on the country. The period
of the oscillation is much shorter than that of Spanish flu in 1918∼1919 which is the result of
the mutation of virus, and it is an open question why the infection curve of COVID-19 shows
oscillation in some countries.
There have been several compartmental models which explain epidemic oscillations [3, 4,
5]. The simplest idea to explain the oscillation is to introduce a sinusoidal time dependence of
parameters of the model. Recently, Greer et al [6] introduced a dynamical model with timevarying births and deaths which shows oscillations of epidemics.
Since the infection curve of COVID-19 shows different features depending on the country,
the infection curve must have a strong relation to the government policy, and the conventional
approach may not be appropriate to COVID-19. In fact, different measures have been employed
in each country by its government and citizens have been restricting the social contact among
them, both of which depend on the infection status. Therefore, parameters including transmission coefficient of the virus can be considered to be a function of the infection status, and the
non-linear effects due to this dependence must be clarified.
In this paper, I introduce a compartment model in which the net rate λ of change of the
number of infected individuals I is a function of I and the function is given by an ellipse
in the λ-I plane which is supported in [Iℓ , Ih ]. Here, Ih is the upper limit of the number of
infected individuals above which the government does not allow, and Iℓ is the lowest value
below which the government will lift measures. I show that an oscillatory infection curve can
be self-organized when Iℓ > 0 and that the period is determined by the ratio of the difference
√
Ih − Iℓ and the geometric mean Ih Iℓ of Ih and Iℓ . I also show that when Iℓ = 0 the infection
curve in the long time limit after a single peak decays following a power law function with
exponent -2 and when Iℓ < 0 it decays exponentially in the long time limit.

2 Model country
In most of compartmental models for epidemics, the number of infected individuals I(t) is
assumed to obey
dI(t)
= λI(t).
dt

(1)

The net rate of change λ of the number of infected individuals is written generally as
λ=β

S
− γ − α.
N

(2)

Here, β and γ are the transmission rate of virus from an infected individual to a susceptible
individual and a per capta rate for becoming a recovered non-infectious (including dead) individual (R), respectively, and S and N are the number of susceptible individuals and the total
population. In Eq. (2), α is a model-dependent parameter representing different effect of epidemics. In the SIR model [8], it is assumed that no effects other than transmission and recovery
are considered and thus α = 0 is assumed. The SEIR model [9] introduces a compartment of
exposed individuals (E), and if one sets α = (dE/dt)/I, the basic equation of the SEIR model
reduces to Eq. (1).
The SIQR model [10, 11] separates quarantined patients (Q) as a compartment in the population and α in Eq. (1) is given by the quarantine rate q ≡ ∆Q(t)/I(t) where ∆Q(t) is the
daily confirmed new cases [7]. In the application of the SIQR model to COVID-19, it has been
shown that
∆Q(t) ∝ I(t − τ ),

(3)

where τ is a typical value of the waiting time between the infection and quarantine of an infected
individual. Therefore, the number of the daily confirmed new cases can be assumed to obey
Eq. (1) with the redefined time t − τ . Since ∆Q(t) is treated as an explicit variable instead of
I(t), the SIQR model is relevant to COVID-19.
3

In this paper, I focus on the time evolution of I(t) governed by Eq. (1) for COVID-19. The
transmission coefficient is determined by characteristics of the virus and by government policies
for lockdown measure and vaccination and by people’s attitude for social distancing. Medical
treatment of infected individuals affects γ and the government policy on PCR test changes the
quarantine rate. The government policies are determined according to the infection status and
therefore the rate of change is considered to be a function of I(t) in Eq. (1).
Here, I consider a model country in which λ depends on I through
λ
λ0

∆

= 1.

(4)

This implies that when I becomes large, some policies are employed to reduce λ to the negative
area so that I(t) begins to decline and when I becomes small enough, then some measures are
lifted and λ becomes positive again. In fact, the plots of λ(t) against I(t) in many countries
show similar loops [2]. Note that λ = 0 corresponds to either a maximum or a minimum of the
number of infected individuals.
Figure 1 shows this dependence, namely Ih ≡ I0 + ∆ and Iℓ ≡ I0 −∆ are the maximum and
minimum of the number of infected individuals set by the policy in the country. When Iℓ < 0,
λ in the region I < 0 is not relevant since no infected individuals exist in this region.

The infection curves are shown for a = 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1 in Fig. 2(a) and for a = 1, 2, 4, 6 in Fig.

with a single peak when a ≥ 1.
Characteristics of the infection curve are in order:
(1) When a < 1, the infection curve shows a self-organized oscillation which can be characterized as follows:

4 Discussion
I have shown that oscillation of the infection curve can be self-organized in the epidemic model
described by an ordinary differential equation which exploits the net rate of change Eq. (4)

depending on the number of infected individuals. All countries employ their own policy which
depends on the infection status of the country and the relation Eq. (4) represents general trend
of the policy. Namely, when the number of infected individuals approaches the maximum
number acceptable in a country, a strong measure is introduced to make the net rate of change λ
negative, and the measure will be lifted when the number of infected individuals is considered
to be small enough, which makes λ > 0. Therefore, the policy with Iℓ > 0 itself is considered
to be the origin of the oscillation of the infection curve and the policy with Iℓ < 0 seems to
have succeeded in controlling the pandemic [2]. As an example, I show in Fig. 4(a) the time
dependence of daily confirmed new cases in Japan from April 5, 2020 to February 11, 2021
which consists of three waves. Using λ determined by fitting the data by piece-wise quadratic
functions as shown by the solid curve [2], I show the correlation between λ and ∆Q in Fig.
4(b).
Some of oscillations in biological systems such as the prey and predator system have been

8

explained by the Lotka-Volterra model [12, 13], which is essentially a coupled logistic equation
and it is reducible to a second order non-linear differential equation for one variable. Since the
present model is based on a first order non-linear differential equation, the origin of oscillatory
solution of the present model is different from that of the Lotka-Volterra model.
Several important implications of the present results are:
(1) In order to control the outbreak, a policy is needed to make a > 1 or Iℓ < 0 and λ < 0.
Since λ is determined by β, S, γ and α(or q), this can be achieved by the lockdown measure to
reduce β, by the vaccination to reducing S and by the quarantine measure to increase q.
(2) The worst policy is Iℓ > 0. In this case, oscillation continues until λ becomes negative due
to the herd immunity by vaccination and/or infection of a significant fraction of the population.
(3) In order to make λ negative, it has been rigorously shown that increasing the quarantine rate
q is more efficient than reducing the transmission coefficient β by the lockdown measure [14].
This result indicates that the pandemic can be controlled only by keeping measures of λ < 0 till
I = 0.
(4) It should be remarked that the change in the infectivity of the virus due to mutation can
be included in λ(I) in the present model. Namely effects due to new variants of SARS-CoV-2
found in UK, in South Africa or in Brazil can be included by moving the state to a new λ vs I
relation.
In this study, I assumed that I0 is fixed and the dependence of λ on I is symmetric. It is easy
to generalize the present formalism to the case of non-symmetric dependence of λ on I.
