Abstract
As COVID-19 quickly became one of the most concerned global crisis, the demand
for data in academic research is also increasing. Currently, there are several open access
Twitter datasets, but none of them is dedicated to the institutional and news media Twitter
data collection. To fill this blank, we retrieved data from 69 institutional/news media Twitter
accounts, 17 of them were related to government and international organizations, 52 of them
were news media across North America, Europe and Asia. We believe our open access data
can provide researchers more availability to conduct social science research.

Introduction
COVID-19 was announced as pandemic by WHO on 11 Mar [1], being the only
pandemic in the past 10 years (the last one was 2009 swing flu), it was first detected as an
unknown pneumonia in Wuhan (Hubei, China). On April 1st, 2020, John Hopkins University
Coronavirus Resource Center [2], reported that the ongoing epidemic has infected 938,373
people, the death toll has already reached 47,272, given the highly contagious nature of the
virus as well as the significant mortality rate, numerous governments have announced
national lockdown. The impact of COVID-19 on world economy and politics is
unprecedented in modern time.
On the past Ebola epidemic crisis, scholars found the importance of using Twitter
data to do social science research [3], [4], many of them use this microblog data as social
1

indicators to analyze the effect of epidemic outbreak on public concerns [5], health
information needs and health seeking behavior [6], and public response to policy makers [7]
etc. Current open access COVID-19 Twitter data were mainly collected by keywords, such as
coronavirus, Covid-19 etc [8], [9], none of the them is dedicated to government/news media
tweet collection. Given that our retrieval targets are policy makers and news source, we
believe our dataset can provide scholars more valuable data to conduct social science
research in related fields, such as crisis communication, public relation etc.

Data collection strategy
We used Twitter REST API to retrieve twitter data from March 12, 2020, there are 8
collection categories: “gov tweet” (governments, international organizations etc.), “US news
tweet”, “UK news tweet”, “Spain news tweet”, “Germany news tweet”, “France news tweet”,
“China news tweet” and “Additional news tweet” (news source added later), each of them
contains various collection target (twitter account name, details see next section).
At the first time we collected the most recent 3200 tweets of every collection target
before March 12, 2020, we didn’t set a time limit, which implies that the date of the first
tweet from each of the sources may vary and even be relatively old. We update our dataset
every week (last update on April 2, 2020), after removing duplicated data by matching tweet
id, we get the clean version data.
On the other hand, due to the data collection strategy we made, there may be tweets
both related and unrelated to COVID-19, which opens up new possibilities for academic
analysis.

Data Availability
The dataset is available on Github at the following address:
https://github.com/narcisoyu/Institional-and-news-media-tweet-dataset-for-COVID-19social-science-research. Our data was collected in compliance with Twitter’s official
developer agreement and policy [10]. The dataset will be updated weekly, interested
researchers will need to agree upon the terms of usage dictated by the chosen license.
Following Twitter official policies, we released and stored only tweet ids, as far as we
