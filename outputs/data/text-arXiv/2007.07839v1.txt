Abstract
The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic
policy uncertainty in the US and the UK. The impact of the increase in COVID-19 cases and
deaths in the country, and the increase in the number of cases and deaths outside the country
may vary. To examine this, the study employs bootstrap ARDL cointegration approach from
March 8, 2020 to May 24, 2020. According to the bootstrap ARDL results, a long-run
equilibrium relationship is confirmed for five out of the 10 models. The long-term coefficients
obtained from the ARDL models suggest that an increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths
outside of the UK and the US has a significant effect on economic policy uncertainty. The US
is more affected by the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. The UK, on the other hand,
is more negatively affected by the increase in the number of COVID-19 deaths outside the
country than the increase in the number of cases. Moreover, another important finding from the
study demonstrates that COVID-19 is a factor of great uncertainty for both countries in the
short-term.

Introduction
The outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has become the focal point of the
world. Although the ultimate impact of the pandemic is not yet fully known, it is a problem
beyond important issues such as wars, natural disasters, environmental pollution and absence.
The COVID-19 virus emerged in Wuhan, China towards the end of 2019, spreading rapidly
from person to person and surrounded the world. By May 25, 2020, although China seems to
have overcome COVID-19, the number of cases and deaths continues to increase in countries
such as the US, Brazil, the UK and Spain. The Chinese government has managed to prevent the
spread of the pandemic by implementing quarantine in Wuhan, and temporarily stopping
production activities in most sectors. Similarly, many countries have started to take measures
with the same practices. However, the lockdowns and quarantines are not economically
sustainable and for this reason the measures have started to be stretched gradually.
The COVID-19 is a multi-faceted global crisis that simultaneously interrupts supply, demand
and productivity. It has launched a de-globalization process, forcing countries to close their
borders, resulting in the restriction of the flow of capital, goods and services between countries,
and shot down of business and production, albeit temporarily (Barua, 2020). As the number of
COVID-19 deaths and cases increases, uncertainty, panic, fear and anxiety continue to spread
in countries. A major uncertainty is associated with COVID-19 cases and deaths. In addition,
the global economic practices and related policy reactions of the pandemic are also uncertain
(Barro et al. 2020). While some countries can effectively treat reported cases, it is uncertain
where, when and how new cases will occur (Mckibbin and Fernando, 2020), how long COVID19 will last, whether there will be vaccine against the pandemic, how long will governments
maintain current incentives to address COVID-19 induced economic problems, and what the
social, economic and political implications of this virus will be in the future. It remains unclear
whether the economic recovery or stagnation process will be L-, V or U-shaped in many

2

countries after the virus. The pandemic has triggered many more health, social and economic
uncertainty. COVID-19 has a negative impact on many sectors including finance, banking,
travel, health, service, transportation and infrastructure. The continuity of production and
consumption activities in these sectors has been deteriorated due to the virus. Investors stop
their investments and withdraw new investment decisions in countries where the virus creates
economic uncertainty. In order to protect the citizens of the countries, the social and economic
activities against the countries where the virus spreads rapidly are suspended, albeit for a short
time. Although the COVID-19 started in China, as of May 2020, the US became the epicenter
of the virus. These two countries make up almost 40% of the world's gross domestic product.
For the past fifty years, China and the US have not faced a combined supply and demand shock
simultaneously. The potential effects of the COVID-19 crisis are much larger than any other
seen in history (Fernandes, 2020). For all these reasons, the world is in a period of great
uncertainty that has never been seen before.
This study attempts to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on economic policy uncertainty (EPU)
in the UK and the US. These two countries are selected due to the availability of daily EPU
data. The study focuses on two research questions. I) Does the COVID-19 pandemic affect
economic policy uncertainty more negatively in the US or the UK? II) Is the number of cases
and deaths in the country or outside the country affecting the EPU more? The answer to these
two questions has been sought through empirical analysis.
The rest of the study is structured as follows. Section 2 provides basic information on COVID19 and economic uncertainty in the UK and the US. Section 3 introduces the data set, models
and methods used in the study. Section 4 summarizes and discusses the empirical findings, and
the last section concludes the study.

The COVID-19 and Economic Policy Uncertainty in the US and the UK
The COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to increase around the world. On May 25, the number
of COVID-19 cases exceeded 5,3 million. At the same time, 342,894 people lost their lives due
to the pandemic. The COVID-19 mortality rate is approximately 6.4% worldwide. In other
words, 6 out of 100 cases die from the virus. The number of COVID-19 deaths and cases in the
US is 97,720 and 1,6 million people, respectively. The US accounts for 28% of the worldwide
deaths and 30% of the cases caused by COVID-19. Although the US has the highest COVID19 cases and deaths in the world, considering the mortality rates, the situation is not that bad.
On May 25, the mortality rate from COVID-19 was 6% in the US, while it was 14% in the UK.
On the same date, the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the UK were 259,559 and
36,793, respectively. In terms of infected patients, the virus was transmitted to 0.49% of the US
population and 0.38% of the UK population. Neither country has been able to produce any
permanent solutions to reduce the spread of the pandemic. In the UK, Prime Minister Boris
Johnson was infected with the virus and remained in intensive care for three days. Horton
(2020) stated that the UK is following an astonishingly haphazard approach to managing the
COVID-19 crisis. There are similar problems in the US. The International Monetary Fund
(2020) foresees that the economies of the US and the UK will contract by 5.9% and 6.5% in
2020. Governments' failure to tackle COVID-19 continues to adversely affect economies.
According to Baker et al. (2020a), a year-on-year contraction in the US economy will be around
11%-20% in the last quarter of 2020. The authors stated that half of this contraction in the output
of the US would be due to COVID-19 induced uncertainty. Moreover, Baker et al (2020b)
predicted that the GDP growth of the US will decrease by 7% in the second quarter of 2020.
Similarly, Dietrich et al. (2020) stated that US households expect a 6% decrease in output within
the 12 months following March 2020 and also documented that the uncertainty in output loss
is quite large. Ludvigson et al. (2020) also argued that the US industrial production will

4

decrease by 12.75% and service sector employment by 17% over a period of ten months, and
the COVID-19 induced macroeconomic uncertainty will last for five months. As stated in the
above studies, in order to eliminate the negative effects of increasing uncertainty on the
economy, the FED tried to revive the falling aggregate demand by cutting interest rates.
In addition to the China-US trade wars, the Brexit process and the conflicts in the middle east,
uncertainty spiked as a result of the rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus (Leduc and Liu, 2020).
The COVID-19 pandemic caused a large increase in uncertainty, similar to the 1929 Great
Depression rather than the 2008 global crisis (Baker et al. (2020a). Empirically, uncertainty
causes significant declines in production, consumption and investment activities, and the peak
of this negative situation appears exactly one year later (Basu and Bundick, 2017). In the
COVID-19 era, economic policy uncertainty has increased significantly in the UK and the US.

Fig. 1 EPU in the US and the UK from 1 January 2001 to 25 May 2020.
Fig. 1. illustrates the time path of EPU in the US and the UK over a 20-year period. The US has
been experiencing the highest economic uncertainty of the last 20 years. In 2003, when the US
and the UK invaded Iraq and then the Iraq disarmament crisis occurred, the economic
uncertainty of the UK is high. In 2016, when the UK EPU reached the highest point, the British
5

government held a referendum to exit the European Union. The UK officially left the European
Union on January 31, 2020. The Brexit process is expected to fully end on December 31, 2020.
Recently, besides Brexit, the COVID-19 pandemic has also caused an increase in EPU. Since
the virus appeared, the value of EPU in the UK has risen 15 times to over 1,000.

Fig. 2 EPU, COVID-19 cases in the US, the UK and outside the countries.
Fig. 2 shows the EPU and COVID-19 cases in the US and the UK, and COVID-19 cases outside
of the countries. In the figure, the left vertical axes indicate the COVID-19 statistics, and the
right vertical axes indicate the EPU statistics. Accordingly, the EPU values, which were around
200 in the first week of March in both countries, increased to 700 and 1300 in the US and UK
towards the end of March, respectively. Moreover, EPU reached high levels in both countries
in April and May.
Data Set, Model and Methodology
In this study, we investigated the effect of COVID-19 on EPU in the US and the UK covering
the period of March 7, 2020 to May 24, 2020. To this end, we used four different models as
follows:
lnEPUUS t =β0 +β1 lncasesUS t +ut (lnEPUUK t =β0 +β1 lncasesUK t +ut )

(1)

lnEPUUS t =δ0 +δ1 lncasesOUS t +et (lnEPUUK t =δ0 +δ1 lncasesOUK t +et )

(2)

6

lnEPUUS t =μ0 +μ1 lndeathsUS t +vt (lnEPUUK t =μ0 +μ1 lndeathsUK t +vt )

(3)

lnEPUUS t =τ0 +τ1 lndeathsOUS t +zt (lnEPUUK t =τ0 +τ1 lndeathsOUK t +zt )

(4)

where β0 , δ0 , μ0 , and τ0 are the constant terms, β1 , δ1 , μ1 , and τ1 are the long-term coefficients,
ut , et , vt , and zt are the independent and identically distributed error terms, EPUUS (EPUUK )
refers to daily economic policy uncertainty in the US (the UK), casesUS (casesUK ) represents
the number of COVID-19 cases in the US (the UK), deathsUS (deathsUK ) denotes the number
of COVID-19 deaths in the US (the UK), casesOUS (casesOUK ) illustrates the number of COVID19 cases outside the relevant country, and deathsOUS (deathsOUK ) indicates the number of
COVID-19 deaths outside the relevant country. The EPU index is calculated with the frequency
of use of the terms about economics, policy and uncertainty in daily newspaper articles. The
data of COVID-19 deaths and cases were obtained from European Centre for Disease
Prevention

and

Control

(2020),

and

the

EPU

data

were

collected

from

https://www.policyuncertainty.com/index.html developed by Baker et al. (2016). Before
performing the analysis, all variables were converted into logarithmic form.
We used the bootstrap autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach in order to examine
short- and long-term relationships between variables. In this approach, in addition to the
conventional bounds testing procedure, a new test developed by McNown et al. (2018) and
critical values are obtained with the bootstrap resampling method. For the bootstrap ARDL
approach, in the first step, the following unrestricted error correction model (UECM) proposed
by Pesaran et al. (2001) can be estimated as follows:
n

m

∆𝑙𝑛EPUt = β0 + ∑ α1 ∆𝑙𝑛EPUt-i + ∑ α2 ∆lncasest-i +μ1 𝑙𝑛EPUt-1 +μ2 lncasest-1 + ut
i=1

(5)

i=0

where ∆ is the difference operator, β0 is the constant term, n and m are indices of lags, lnEPUt
is the dependent variable, lncasest is the independent variable, μ1 and μ2 are the long term
coefficients, α1 and α2 are the short term coefficients, and ut is the i.i.d. error term. This equation
7

represents the first stage of the conventional ARDL bounds test that widely used by researchers
because it allows analysis of variables that have different order of integration. In this approach,
Pesaran et al. (2001) proposed two tests for the analysis of cointegration. From these tests, the
overall F-test is applied to both independent and depended variables, while the t-test (tdependent) is applied only to the dependent variable.
Pesaran et al. (2001) stated that degenerate cases occur in two ways depending on whether the
dependent variable or independent variables are found to be statistically insignificant in the
error correction model (Degenerate case I: The test statistics of the overall F-test and tdependent test are significant, while the independent variable is stationary at level. Degenerate
case II: The overall F-test is significant but t-dependent test is insignificant). In the degenerate
cases, there is no cointegration between the variables in the model. On the other hand, in the
conventional ARDL approach, there are two conditions for the identification of cointegration.
First, the null hypothesis of no cointegration must be rejected with the overall F- and the tdependent tests. As the second condition, the dependent variable must be I (1). Pesaran et al.
(2001) excluded the degenerate case I, assuming the dependent variable I (1). However, this
exclusion and a test based only on the overall F statistic can cause biased results. Therefore,
McNown et al. (2018) proposed an additional test applied only to the level values of the
independent variables. Thus, the significance of the dependent variable and independent
variables in the error correction term can be tested separately. Moreover, the authors derived
critical values using the bootstrap method. The bootstrap test improves the estimation in terms
of size and power properties. Furthermore, the bootstrap method maintains its strong size and
properties even when all variables are I(0) (McNown et al., 2018). This method also eliminates
the inconclusive inferences about the existence of cointegration and degenerate cases (Goh et
al. 2020), and the requirement of the dependent variable to be I(1). The bootstrap ARDL
approach is unique because it is not sensitive to the integration properties of the variables

8

(Nawaz et al. 2019). Furthermore, this approach provides bootstrapped critical values for
overall F, t-dependent and F-independent tests. The null and alternative hypotheses for three
test statistics can be written as follows:
•

For overall F-test statistic, H0:μ1 =μ2 =0, Halternative:μ1 ≠μ2 ≠0

•

For t-dependent test statistic, H0:μ1 =0, Halternative:μ1 ≠0

•

For F-independent test statistic, H0:μ2 =0, Halternative: μ2 ≠0

The null hypotheses are rejected if the test statistics of the overall F and F-independent tests are
greater than the bootstrap critical values. For the t-dependent test, the null hypothesis is rejected
when the test statistic is less than the relevant critical value. If the null hypothesis is rejected
with all three test statistics, then the exact cointegration relationship is confirmed. After
confirming cointegration, short- and long-term coefficients are estimated simultaneously.
Empirical Results and Discussion
In the first stage of the analysis, we investigated the stationarity properties of the variables to
ensure that none of the variables are integrated at I(2). The bootstrap ARDL test can be used
without knowing the stability properties of the series. However, the critical values considered
in this approach are derived by the assumption that the variables are stationary at the level or
first difference. If any variable is second difference stationary, the bootstrap ARDL approach
cannot be applied. In order to determine if this condition is met, we used conventional
Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) (Dickey and Fuller, 1981) and Phillips -Perron (PP) (Phillips
and Perron, 1988) unit root tests. The results of the unit root tests are given in Table 1.

According to the results shown in Table 1, six of the 10 variables are stationary at the level,
while the other four variables contain unit roots. Moreover, none of the variables are stationary
at the second difference [I(2)]. Because the variables have a different order of integration and
the dependent variables are level stationary, we performed the bootstrap ARDL approach to
investigate cointegration between the variables. The results of this approach are shown in Table
2.

We used the bootstrap ARDL approach for eight different models. These models were analyzed
based on COVID-19 cases and deaths (inside and outside the country). For the bootstrap ARDL
models, the optimal lag lengths are selected based on the Schwarz-Bayesian criterion. The
results of the bootstrap ARDL test show that there exists a long run relationship between the
variables in 5 out of eight models. In the five models, the null hypothesis of no cointegration is
rejected by both F-tests and the t-test. Interestingly, in the UK, both the number of cases and
deaths within the country do not affect the EPU. In the US, only COVID-19 deaths that occur
within the country do not affect EPU. For both countries, COVID-19 cases and deaths outside
the relevant country affect its EPU. At the last stage of the analysis, we estimated the long- and
short-term coefficients based on the ARDL model. These coefficients are reported in Table 3.

The five models pass all the diagnostic tests for autocorrelation, stability, non-normality,
specification and heteroscedasticity (see Table 1A and Fig. 1A in the Appendix). For the US,
both domestic and international COVID-19 cases increase the EPU in the long-term. Moreover,
the increasing number of COVID-19 deaths in the country raises uncertainty. The uncertainty11

enhancing effect of COVID-19 cases outside of the US is greater than the increase in the number
of deaths. In the short term, COVID-19 also creates enormous uncertainty for the US economy.
When the results are analyzed for the UK, it is seen that the increase in COVID-19 cases and
deaths outside of the UK have a positive impact on its EPU. Unlike the US, COVID-19 deaths
have a greater impact on increasing EPU in the UK. Keeping other things constant, COVID-19
has a significant effect on EPU for both countries.
To our knowledge, only one study to date has examined the effect of COVID-19 on EPU.
Albulescu (2020) investigated the impact of COVID-19 on the EPU in the US covering the
period of 21 January 2020 to 13 March 2020, and found that global COVID-19 cases and the
death ratio have no effect on the US EPU. However, investigating the situation outside China,
he determined that the increase in the number of cases and death ratio have a positive influence
on EPU in the US. Differently, we examined the effects of COVID-19 deaths and cases on the
EPU in the US and the UK. We also analyzed the effects of total COVID-19 deaths and cases
outside the US and the UK on EPU. When Albulescu (2020) conducted the study, there were
only 2,126 cases and 48 deaths in the US on March 13. To date, the situation in COVID-19 is
quite different in both the US and the UK. The US is the country with the highest number of
cases and deaths in the world. The UK ranks 5th in terms of number of COVID-19 cases.
Nevertheless, despite differences, our empirical results support the findings of Albulescu (2020)
who reported that COVID-19 contributes to uncertainty.
Conclusion
The rapid increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths put pressure on financial markets and real
economies. In many countries, production and consumption activities in various sectors are
decreasing due to stay at home and quarantine measures that are taken to prevent the spread of
the pandemic. It remains unclear when the COVID-19 will stop, whether a second wave will
be experienced again and what its economic effects will be. This also causes an increase in
12

economic policy uncertainty. To this context, the study has analyzed the effect of COVID-19
on EPU in the US and the UK, comparatively. For that purpose, we perform a bootstrap ARDL
approach.
There are three main findings of the study. First, the COVID-19 pandemic increases
economic policy uncertainty in both the US and the UK. Second, the short-term adverse effect
of the pandemic on uncertainty is much more than the long-term. Third, in terms of economic
uncertainty, the UK is more sensitive to COVID-19 deaths than cases. On the contrary, the US
is more affected by the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. The results of the study
indicate that the relationship between the pandemic and uncertainty may vary depending on the
COVID-19 criterion, the country studied and the situation of COVID-19 in and out of the
country.
