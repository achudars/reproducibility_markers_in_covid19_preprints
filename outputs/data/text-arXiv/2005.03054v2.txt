Abstract
In this work, we simulate the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics in a population modeled as a network of groups wherein infection can propagate both via intra-group and
via inter-group interactions. Our results emphasize the importance of diminishing
the inter-group infections in the effort of substantial flattening and delaying of the
epi(demiologic) curve with concomitant mitigation of disastrous economy and social
consequences. To exemplify with a limiting case, splitting a population into m (say,
5 or 10) noninteracting groups while keeping intra-group interaction unchanged yields
a stretched epidemiological curve having the maximum number of daily infections reduced and postponed in time by the same factor m (5 or 10). More generally, our study
suggests a practical approach to fight against SARS-CoV-2 virus spread based on population splitting into groups and minimizing intermingling between them. This strategy

1

can be pursued by large-scale infrastructure reorganization of activity at different levels
in big logistic units (e.g., large productive networks, factories, enterprises, warehouses,
schools, (seasonal) harvest work). Importantly, unlike total lockdwon strategy, the
proposed approach prevents economic ruin and keeps social life at a more bearable
level than distancing everyone from anyone. Last but not least, the declaration, for the
first time in Europe, that COVID-19 epidemic ended in the two million people Slovenia
may be taken as confirming the advantage of the strategy proposed in this paper.

Introduction

Neither natural immunization nor vaccination or pharmacologic intervention can currently
help in fighting the COVID-19 global pandemic. 1 Most frequently, to prevent disastrous
sanitary consequences, governments across the world responded by imposing, e.g., social
(=physical) distancing, wearing face masks, lockdown regulations, and rigid sanitary moves
aiming at reducing the infection rate (“flattening the epidemiological curve”). Still, politics
cannot push strict restrictions indefinitely, and “how much is too much?” is a question of
time which unavoidably arises sooner or later. Fighting COVID-19 should not ruin economy. 2 This is certainly what a draconian lockdown across the world over months would
do. Parenthetically, catastrophic economic consequences inherently make healthcare system
itself also collapsing.
In this vein, mathematical modeling may make a notable contribution in providing politics
with reasonable suggestions to slowing down epidemic propagation and reducing medical
burden while mitigating economy and social crisis. A series of mathematical COVID-19
simulations have recently appeared. 3–10 Most of them are based on deterministic continuoustime epidemiological models, which consider age-independent epidemiological classes of, e.g.,
susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), and recovered (R) individuals, 11–16 whose numbers
2

S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t) evolve in time (t) according to a system of (deterministic) ordinary
differential equations.
Open access sources already available 17–19 enable one to easily perform various numerical simulations by means of such models. Unfortunately the various SIR-inspired flavors
need (too many) input parameters difficult to validate, 20 and this would rather mask than
enlighten the main idea which the present work aims at conveying. Therefore, to better emphasize this idea, instead of a SIR-based approach (which would pose no special problem),
in this paper we prefer to adopt the simpler logistic growth framework. The logistic model is
particularly appealing in view of its simplicity and versatility demonstrated in approaching a
broad variety of real systems with very different nature, 21–28 including population dynamics
of epidemic states. 29–32 Prior to this study, results based on the logistic model were presented
for COVID-19 time evolution in China and USA. 33
Fighting against the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus while allowing economic and social
activity to continue to a reasonable extent represents a major challenge for the present era.
Extended lockdown does not represent an acceptable response to this challenge. From this
perspective, we believe that the results reported below obtained by extending the conventional logistic model may provide useful suggestions on how to sidestep the ongoing difficulty
of living under pandemic conditions.
While the implementation of the presently proposed strategy via population splitting
into smaller groups and reducing intermingling certainly requires considerable effort and
fantasy in infrastructure reorganization, it offers the perspective of flattening and delaying
the epidemiological curve by obviating wrecking of economy and maintaining social life to a
level more bearable than total lockdown.

Methods

The results reported below were obtained by means of the logistic model 21–28 extended (see
equation (16)) to allow treatment of infection propagation in a network consisting of groups
in interaction. To fix the ideas and to make the paper self-contained, in Section 3.1 we will
first review the main aspects related to the logistic model applied to an isolated group using
a terminology adapted to the specific subject under consideration. The extension of the
logistic model to groups in interaction will be presented in Section 3.2.

Results and Discussion

Logistic Growth in an Isolated Group

Uninhibited infected population n growths in time t according to the Malthus law 34
d
ne = κne
dt

(1)

The intrinsic population-independent rate κ entering equation (1) is expressed in terms of
the probability β of infection per encounter with an infected individual multiplied by the
number N of encounters per unit time (day)

κ = βN

(2)

This yields an unlimited exponential time growth (n0 ≡ n (t = 0))
ne (t) = n0 eκt

(3)

depicted by the dark green J-shaped curve of Figure 1a.
In a real situation, the exponential growth will gradually slow down and eventually

4

level off. Infections become more and more unlikely because, in a given environment, the
increase in the number of infected diminishes the number of individuals that can be infected.
Rephrasing, the effective growth rate decreases with increasing population density: κ → κ̃ =
f (n)κ < κ. By assuming a linear decrease of f with n, one arrives at the logistic model 21–26

Plotted as a function of time (Figure 1a), equation (5) yields an exponential J-shaped curve
only at early times which switches to an S-shaped (sigmoid) curve as the population increases
and saturates to the maximum (plateau) value N, which defines the so-called carrying capacity of a given environment. The parenthesis entering the right hand side of equation (5),
which acts as Darwin’s “struggle for existence” and suppresses the exponential growth, is

Figure 1: Logistic growth is characterized by a cumulative number of infected cases n(t)
following an S-shaped (sigmoid) curve (panel a) exhibiting an acceleration stage (close to a
J-shaped exponential growth), which switches to a deceleration stage beyond the half-time
T50 and attains p(= 95, 99, see equation (12)) percent of the plateau value N. Saturation
occurs because the effective infection rate κ̃ is time dependent and gradually decreases to
zero (panel b). The epi(demiologic) curve ṅ(t) ≡ dn/dt (daily number of new cases) exhibits
a peak located at t = T50 whose shape is controlled by the infection rate κ (panel c). Time
on the x-axis is expressed in units of the characteristic time Tc = κ−1 .

At t = T50 , there is a substantial infection slowing with respect to the exponential
growth. There, the instantaneous infection rate κ̃ is reduced by 50% as compared to that of
the uninhibited growth κ (equation (4) and Figure 1b).
Saturation occurs within a few characteristic times Tc ≡ κ−1 beyond the half-time T50
(Figure 1a). The moment (“day”) Tp when the number Np of infected amounts to p percent

(15)

Large values of κ, amounting to a sharp and high peak in Figure 1c, may cause healthcare
systems collapses.
Diminishing the value of κ is of paramount practical importance for a twofold reason:
(i) It renders the peak broader and smaller (Figure 1c). Keeping the daily number of infected cases at a manageable level (“flattening of the curve”) is essential for not overwhelming
the healthcare system beyond its capacity to treat the sick.
(ii) Small values of κ yield large values of T50 (cf. equation (10)). This means postponement of infection explosion and hence gaining time for a better sanitary and logistic
preparation to tackle an upcoming problem: preventing shortage of intensive care unit beds
and gaining time for securing and/or producing critical emergency equipment (e.g., masks,
ventilators, artificial lungs, personal protective equipment, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machines, ventilators or other devices) needed to reduce mortality rate.

3.2

Modeling Infection in Interacting Groups

The above considerations referred to a closed population in which members are neither added
nor lost from the group. Neither “imported” nor “exported” infections were included. Let us
now focus on a network consisting of groups of individuals {nj } = {n1 , n2 , . . . , nm } wherein

7

infections can proliferate both by infections within the same group (intra-group infection
rates κj ≡ κjj ) and because individuals of one group j can infect or can be infected by
individuals of other groups p 6= j (inter-group/intermingling infection rates κpj and κjp ,
respectively). Figure 2 schematically depicts the case of two groups.

Figure 2: Schematic representation of a network consisting of two groups 1 and 2 wherein
epidemic can spread (panel b) both through intra-group infections (infection rates κ1 and
κ2 ) and through inter-group infections (infection rates κ12 and κ21 ). Limiting cases wherein
the network is split into two groups that are completely separated among themselves (κ12 =
κ21 = 0, panel a) or perfectly intermingled (κ1,2 = κ12 = κ21 = κ, panel c).

Although solving equation (16) in general poses no special numerical problem (some
examples are presented in Figure 4 and Figure 5 of Section 3.4), to better emphasize the
strategy we aim at conveying, let us first focus on the case of identical groups

3.3

Analysis of Two Limiting Cases of Practical Importance

The results of Section 3.2 allow us to compare how infection propagates in a network (“larger
group”) of individuals split into several (m) smaller (sub)groups (chosen identical for simplicity) which do not interact with each other against the case of a fictitious splitting, wherein
(from the point of view of infection) interactions between members of a given group and
between members belonging to different groups are identical (perfect intermingling). Noteworthy, whether the groups are completely separated of each other (label s) or perfectly
intermingled (label i), the total initial population n0T = mn0 is taken to be the same in both
cases (cf. equation (17))
ns0T = ni0T

(29)

The former case, corresponding to separated groups (label i), is characterized by a vanishing inter-group infection rate ( κ′ ≡ 0). Applied to this case, equations (26), (27) and
(28) yield

At the opposite extreme of perfectly intermingled groups, inter-group interactions are as
strong as intra-group interactions (κ′ = κ). Based on equations (26), (27) and (28) we then
get

(31)

The above results show that the epidemiological curve can be substantially flattened if
a larger group is split into several smaller groups separated from each other. By starting
from the same number of infections (equation (29)), splitting into groups separated from one
another yields a reduction of the infection rate and of the maximum daily cases by a factor

Equally pleasantly, splitting leads in addition to a time postponement of the infection

(35)

The results presented in Figure 3 depict these findings for the particular case of a larger
group split into two smaller groups (m = 2). They also schematically visualize how and why
group splitting can relieve the healthcare system. To avoid misunderstandings, one should
note that the value m = 2 in Figure 3 was chosen just for more clarity. Splitting into more
than two noninteracting groups (i.e., making m as large as possible) is highly desirable.

flattening and delaying the epidemiological curve by a factor m = 2 by splitting into m = 2
groups can prevent overloading the healthcare system capacity. Time on the x-axis is expressed in units of the characteristic time Tc = κ−1 .
11

Before ending this part, we want to emphasize that, however important, flattening and
delaying the epidemiological curve by a factor m achieved by group splitting (cf. Figure 3 and
equations (32), (33), and (34)) is not the whole issue. Extremely importantly, the presently
proposed group splitting approach does not assume any intra-group (like social distancing
and wearing masks) restrictions: economy and social life within individual groups separated
of each other can continue.

3.4

Additional Results

As anticipated in Section 3.2, the logistic model extended as expressed by equation (16) can
be used to quantify the impact of mutual infections in networks of interacting groups more
general than the particular situations examined in Section 3.3. To briefly illustrate this fact,
two examples are presented in Figures 4 and 5.
Figure 4 depicts the case two groups whose populations differ by a factor of four. As
visible there, in spite of the equal infection rates, infection of the smaller group 2 (dashed
lines) is stronger enhanced by the inter-group interaction than in the larger group 1 (solid
lines).
Figure 5 presents the case two groups merely differing from each other by the different
numbers of initially infected individuals (n01 /N = 0.001 versus n02 /N = 0.1). Comparison
of the various panels of Figure 5 reveals that inter-group infection yields an infection rapidly
“exported” from the initially more infected group to that which was initially less infected.
Intermingling (Figure 5g) quickly wipes out any difference between a initially weaker (or
non)infected group and an initially strongly infected group.

Conclusion

In closing, the results presented above indicate that splitting of a large group into smaller
groups and reducing intermingling appears to be an appealing strategy for substantially

the inter-group interaction than in the larger group 1 (solid lines). Time on the x-axis is
expressed in units of the characteristic time Tc = κ−1 .
reducing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus while still allowing social life to a more bearable
level than distancing everyone from anyone and economy go on, albeit slower.
One can expect that (A) it is easier to impose and maintain longer-term regulations on
splitting a given population into (say, 5 – 10) groups weakly interacting among themselves
than (B) enforcing severe containment measures to all individuals in order to diminish the
probability β of infection per encounter and the number N of daily encounters yielding
a reduction by the same factor (5–10) of the infection rate κ (cf. equation (2)). The big
difference is that with option (A) social life and economy within individual groups go on
without intra-group restrictions, while option (B) means attaining the same epidemiological
curve with both social life and economy paralyzed.
Devising and implementing an adequate restructuring of large logistic units (large productive networks, factories, enterprises, warehouses, etc) allowing, if/when necessary, society
to rapidly switch back and forth between separated groups and intermingled groups can certainly be challenging but may be a long-term strategic goal worth to be pursued when faced
with these COVID-19 pandemic times or other similar difficulties that cannot be ruled out
