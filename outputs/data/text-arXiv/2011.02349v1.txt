Abstract. In this study, we analyze the effectiveness of measures aimed at
finding and isolating infected individuals to contain epidemics like COVID19, as the suppression induced over the effective reproduction number. We
develop a mathematical model to compute the relative suppression of the effective reproduction number of an epidemic that such measures produce. This
outcome is expressed as a function of a small set of parameters that describe
the main features of the epidemic and summarize the effectiveness of the isolation measures. In particular, we focus on the impact when a fraction of the
population uses a mobile application for epidemic control. Finally, we apply
the model to COVID-19, providing several computations as examples, and a
link to a public repository to run custom calculations. These computations
display in a quantitative manner the importance of recognizing infected individuals from symptoms and contact-tracing information, and isolating them
as early as possible. The computations also assess the impact of each variable
on the suppression of the epidemic.

1. Introduction
1.1. Main concepts and goals. This study aims to develop a probabilistic model
to predict the effectiveness of containing an epidemic such as COVID-19 with measures aimed at finding and isolating infected individuals. More precisely, we are
interested in modeling such “isolation measures,” by which we mean finding and
isolating infected people via their symptoms and contact tracing, to predict the
impact of these measures on the effective reproduction number of the epidemic.
Special attention is dedicated to the case in which contact-tracing is achieved, for
a part of the population, through a mobile application.
Studies such as [FWK+ 20] have underlined the role of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission in the COVID-19 outbreak, and the consequent importance of
using a mobile application for efficient contact-tracing. This insight has also led to
the development of models to quantitatively assess the impact of a contact-tracing
app on the epidemic, primarily through agent-based approaches [PDg20].
In this paper, we propose an analytical approach to answer the following questions: How is the effective number Rt of an epidemic impacted when isolation

measures are in place versus when they are not, and what are the main factors contributing to the suppression of Rt ? We take the effective reproduction number in
the absence of isolation measures, denoted by Rt0 , as an input of our model, which
is thus independent of any underlying epidemic model. Moreover, our approach
is parametric in that we concentrate the quantitative description of the isolation
measures into relatively few, comprehensible parameters that comprise the input
of the model. These parameters include the share of the population using an app,
the share of people who self-isolate upon testing positive, and more.
Previous studies concerning the impact on the epidemic of isolating infected
individuals include [MKD00], which proposes a generative stochastic model of SIRtype, and [FRAF04], which uses an analytical method more similar to our own.
The starting point of our analysis is the effective reproduction number Rt0 in
the absence of isolation measures,1 that we consider as given. When speaking
about modeling “isolation measures,” we refer to policies focused on finding and
selectively isolating infected individuals. We do not refer to generalized actions like
imposing a lockdown, whose impact on the epidemic is considered already known
and encompassed in Rt0 .
Rt0 is defined, for any absolute time t, as the expected number of cases generated
by a random individual who was infected at time t during their lifetime. This
quantity can be written as an integral
Z
Rt0 =
βt0 (τ )dτ ,
[0,+∞)

βt0

is the infectiousness distribution, a function describing the expected numwhere
ber of cases generated by an individual who was infected at time t, per unit of
relative time (in units of days), i.e., time elapsed from the time of infection of the
individual [FRAF04]. So, for example, the number
Z
βt0 (τ )dτ
[1,3)

is the expected number of people infected between 24 and 72 hours from the source’s
moment of infection. Note that the normalization βt0 /Rt0 is the PDF of the generation time, the time taken by an individual infected at t to infect a different
individual. (This will be clarified in §2)
In this study, we set up a model to analyze changes in the reproduction number
when the population is subject to isolation measures, including the support of an
app for individuals who have tested positive, and depending on some parameters
of simple interpretation. We denote by
Z
Rt =
βt (τ )dτ
[0,+∞)

the effective reproduction number in presence of isolation measures, and we compute Rt as a function of Rt0 , other epidemiological data such as the symptom onset
distribution, and some parameters describing the isolation measures, such as the
probability that an infected, symptomatic individual gets a test, or the probability
that a recipient of the infection gets notified when its source receives a positive test.

For the development of the model in the following sections, we do not assume any
particular form for βt0 and Rt0 , except that βt0 peaks around its average, which is
necessary for some approximations.
The final goal of the model we propose is to understand the most important
leverages that may facilitate optimization to better direct efforts of decision-makers,
scientists, and developers. Such factors include app efficiencies, timeliness of notifications, app adoption in the population, and others.
1.2. The assumptions of the model and outline of the paper. The model
developed in §2 is the translation into mathematical terms of the following assumptions, that describe an idealized schema in which infected individuals acknowledge
their illness and take measures to avoid infecting others.
• An infected individual who shows symptoms is immediately notified that
they should take a test (which does not discount the possibility that they
acknowledge this necessity independent of such external input). This process does not always necessarily occur, but does so with a probability ss .
• Given a source-recipient pair, when the source tests positive, the recipient
is immediately notified to take a test, with probability sc .
• In either scenario, after an infected individual is notified to take a test,
they take a test which will return a positive result after a time from the
notification, which is distributed according to a given distribution ∆A→T
(possibly reaching +∞ to account for the case in which the individual is
never tested or never receives the positive outcome).
• Immediately upon receiving the positive outcome of the test, an average
infected individual will self-isolate with probability ξ. Put differently, the
number of individuals they infect from this moment is reduced by a factor
1 − ξ compared to the scenario in which they do not take any isolation
measures.
Note that in our model we are only considering forward contact tracing, i.e.,
recipients are notified of the positive result of their source, but not vice-versa.
Doing otherwise would significantly complicate the discussion. This is probably
the main limitation of the model, which may thus underestimate the effectiveness
of the isolation measures: While backward contact tracing is in general less effective
when timeliness in isolating infected individuals is key, it must be noted that its
effect may be significant for epidemics for which super-spreaders, i.e. individuals
that infect a large number of people, have a major impact on the contagion. Such
individuals may be identified more easily thanks to backward tracing. A treatment
of backward tracing in the context of a generative model is covered in [MKD00,
§3.1].
Subsequently, in §3 we consider a more complex model. Instead, we assume that
the population is split into two groups, depending on whether or not they use a
mobile application for epidemic control. The parameters ss and sc are different,
depending on whether they refer to an individual who uses the app.
Finally, in §4, we apply these models by computing the suppression of Rt for
specific choices of the input parameters, particularly to assess the importance of
such parameters. As for the input parameters that describe the epidemic, we use
data relative to COVID-19. All these data are taken for a single source, [FWK+ 20].

4

It should be noted that these quantities are still preliminary, have quite large uncertainties, and are not necessarily the most up-to-date. However, we stress that
these data are only used as inputs in all our computations, which can be easily reproduced and extended by using the code available in the open repository [MM20].
It would be immediate to redo the computations with different inputs, to reflect
any new understandings the scientific community should gain on COVID-19. In
addition to this, in §4.2.3 we briefly check the robustness of our results with respect
to changes in some epidemic data, namely the share of infected individuals that are
asymptomatic and the generation time distribution.
By using the model in §4 to compute the suppression of Rt , we can recognize
how isolation measures, particularly app-mediated isolation measures, can play
an important role in suppressing epidemics. However, our results show how the
efficiency in recognizing infected individuals from symptoms and contact-tracing
information, the credibility of notifications, the timeliness in testing and isolating
suspected cases (as Fig. 2 epitomizes), and a high app adoption rate (Fig. 9) are
all key to reaching satisfactory epidemic suppression levels.
2. The mathematical model in the homogeneous population setting
In this section, we develop the core mathematical model of the paper. We do so
with a simplified scenario in which the same isolation measures apply to the entire
population, thus eliminating the need to distinguish between those who do and who
do not use an app.
2.1. Notations and conventions. We consider random variables on the sample
space of all infected individuals, describing (absolute) times at which certain events
happen: tI (time of infection), tS (time of symptom onset), tA (time of infection
notification), tT (time of positive test). These variables can take +∞ as a value to
express the likelihood that an event never takes place (this is useful when writing
relations between them).
As we want to relate these variables to the reproduction number Rt , which
measures the average number of people infected by an individual infected at a given
time t, it is logical that all these variables refer to the relative time of the average
individual infected at t: so we have, for example, the relative time of symptom
onset, which is the [0, +∞]-valued random variable
τtS = (tS − tI )|tI =t = tS |tI =t − t .
We can assume that this variable is independent of the contagion time t. Hence,
we denote it by τ S . Analogously, we have the random variables τtA (relative time
of notification for an individual infected at t), τtT (relative time of positive test for
an individual infected at t).
In this section we need to understand how to describe the random variables τ S ,
A
τt , τtT , and their relation to the reproduction number
Z
Rt =
βt (τ )dτ ,
[0,+∞)

based on the assumptions of §1.2. The finite parts of these random variables are
described using improper CDFs, denoted by F S , FtA , and FtT respectively, whose
limit for τ → +∞ (representing the probability that each time is less than infinite) may be less than 1. So, for example, FtT (τ ) denotes the probability that an

EFFECTIVENESS OF ISOLATION MEASURES TO CONTAIN EPIDEMICS

5

individual infected at t tests positive within a time τ from the time of infection.
limτ →+∞ FtT (τ ) is the probability that the same individual eventually tests positive. When we speak of expected values of these random variables, we always mean
the expected values of their finite parts.
Further auxiliary variables are introduced later on.
2.2. The suppression model for Rt . Recall from §1.2 how we assume that selfisolation works: If an infected individual tests positive, then they immediately
self-isolate, resulting in a reduction, on average, of the number of people they
subsequently infect by a multiplicative factor 1 − ξ, which we assume given.2
We can then determine a relation between the “default” reproduction number
density βt0 , its correction βt as a result of the isolation measures, and the distribution of the relative time τtT at which individuals infected at t receive a positive test
result. This relation holds for any t greater or equal to the time t0 at which the
isolation measures are enacted.
For simplicity, let’s assume for a moment that receiving a positive test and
infecting someone at a given relative time τ are independent events. By τ , an
individual who was infected at t has already received a test with probability P (τtT <
τ ) = FtT (τ ). In such a case, the number of people they infect per unit time is
(1 − ξ)βt0 (τ ). Alternatively, if the individual has not received a test by τ (which
happens with probability 1 − FtT (τ )), they do not self-isolate, and the average
number of people they infect per unit time is just βt0 (τ ). In summary, we have, for
any τ ∈ [0, +∞),

βt (τ ) = FtT (τ )(1 − ξ)βt0 (τ )+ 1 − FtT (τ ) βt0 (τ )
(1)
= βt0 (τ ) 1 − ξ FtT (τ ) .
This is Eq. 6 in [FRAF04]. To illustrate further, suppose that all infected individuals test positive at a relative time τT , i.e. FtT (τ ) is a Heaviside function with step
at τT : then we have βt (τ ) = βt0 (τ ) for τ < τT and βt (τ ) = (1 − ξ) βt0 (τ ) for τ ≥ τT .
However, the above result relies on the assumption of independence between
testing positive and the number of people who the individual infects. In practice,
this is not an adequate reflection of what occurs. For example, with COVID-19, it is
known [MKZC20] that a significant proportion of the infected population is asymptomatic. This population is less contagious than the others [FWK+ 20], and, given
the lack of symptoms, has a lower probability of self-isolating. To overcome this
factor, we introduce a new random variable G, which has a finite range {g1 , ..., gn }
that describes the severity of symptoms of an infected individual. It is assumed
to be independent of the time τ S of symptom onset, but it is related to the number of infected people and the probability of the individual recognizing their own
symptoms. Then, to write a relation between FtT and Rt , we restrict the relevant
random variables to each possible value of G: for any g = g1 , ..., gN we denote by
T
Ft,g
(τ )

2Equivalently, this hypothesis could be viewed as the assumption that an individual who
tests positive either self-isolates completely, without infecting anyone else from that moment, or,
alternatively, does nothing, with the first circumstance happening with probability ξ.

6

the probability that an individual infected at time t and with severity g has tested
positive by τ . Similarly, we denote by
Z
Rt,g =
βt,g (τ )dτ
[0,+∞)

the average number of people infected by an individual infected at t and with
0
severity g, and by Rt,g
the analogous quantity in absence of isolation measures.
Assuming now that for a given g the number of people infected and the event of
being tested are independent, we write

where pg = P (G = g) is the probability that an infected individual has symptoms
with severity g.3
Observe that our “suppression equation” (2) implies that the input Rt0 can be
safely disregarded, as the ratio Rt /Rt0 depends on the infectiousness only through
the PDF βt0 /Rt0 . The same applies to all variables introduced in this section, which
is why in every calculation of §4, we take Rt0 as equal to 1.
Also, in §4 we always take G to assume the values 0 and 1 only, to describe
asymptomatic versus symptomatic infected individuals. However, this formalism
allows for a greater diversification of Rt0 , according to the severity of the illness.
We end this subsection with an example of an application of (2) in a simplified
scenario. Suppose that G only takes the values 0 and 1, describing asymptomatic
and symptomatic infected individuals, and that each constitutes half of the population. Suppose also that ξ = 1, and that asymptomatic individuals are never
tested, so that Ft,0(τ ) = 0, while symptomatic individuals are tested immediately
after infection, so that Ft,1 (τ ) = θ(τ ), where θ is the Heaviside function. Then, we
0
0
have Rt,0 = Rt,0
and Rt,1 = 0, so that Rt = Rt,0
/2. Had we used Eq. 1 instead, we
0
would have ended up with Rt = Rt /2, which does not take into account the fact
that isolating symptomatic individuals has a greater impact on the reduction of Rt
than isolating the same proportion of randomly chosen individuals.
2.3. First considerations on the variables τ S , τtA , and τtT . The distribution
of the time τ S of symptom onset is independent of the isolation policy and is
considered as given throughout the paper, although its specific shape is irrelevant
in this section.4
The description of τtA is addressed in the next subsection. Here, we only consider
its relation with τtT : Having assumed that the time between notification and testing
positive is described by a given random variable ∆A→T , which is independent from
τtA and for simplicity constant in absolute time, we have
τtT = τtA + ∆A→T .

t,g
Often, in the literature (e.g. in [FWK+ 20]) a different convention is used, according to which the
components sum to Rt . To switch to the latter convention, each Rt,g should be divided by the
respective probability pg .
4In §4 we take F S to be a log-normal distribution, following the literature.

where F A→T is the improper CDF of ∆A→T .
2.4. Describing τtA . In this subsection, we consider the random variable τtA and
study the relations with it that formalize the assumptions of §1.2, namely:
• When an infected individual shows symptoms, they receive an immediate
notification to get tested, with probability ssg depending on the severity g
of symptoms.5
• Immediately after the source of the infection tests positive, each recipient
is notified of the risk, with probability sc .
We introduce two new random variables to the sample space of individuals infected at a given time t, describing the receiving of a notification for either cause:
• We denote by τgA,s the time from infection at which an individual with
severity g is notified because of symptoms. We assume that this happens
with probability ssg at the time τ S of the symptom onset, so its improper
CDF is simply
(5)

FgA,s = ssg F S .
Note that there is no dependency on the absolute time t.
• We denote by τtA,c the time from infection at which an individual infected
at t receives a notification resulting from the positive test of the source of
infection. Below, we see how to describe this.

A
The relation between these new variables and τt,g
is
A
τt,g
= min(τgA,s , τtA,c ) ,

which in terms of improper CDFs gives
(6)

A
Ft,g
= FgA,s + FtA,c − FgA,s FtA,c .

Describing τtA,c requires the introduction of additional random variables, defined
now on the sample space of source-recipient pairs (I1 , I2 ) such that the infection
time of I1 is t:
(1) The generation time τtC , i.e. the time since t at which I1 infects I2 . Its
(proper) PDF is the normalization of βt :
pC
t (τ ) =

1
βt (τ ) .
Rt

(2) The time τ̃tT at which I1 tests positive. This is the single-individual random variable τtT brought to the sample space of source-recipient pairs via
application to the source. Later, we detail why this specification is needed.
For now, we emphasize that the CDF F̃tT of this random variable may be
different from FtT .
5ss would be equal to 0 for asymptomatic individuals.
g

(3) The contact notification time τtN , the time since t at which I2 is informed
of the contact with I1 . We assume that this coincides with max(τ̃tT , τtC ),
except that its improper CDF is multiplied by a factor sct (possibly depending on the time t of I1 ’s infection), representing the probability that I2 is
notified about the contact with the I1 at any time, given that I1 tested
positive. Thus, the improper CDF of τtN reads
(7)

FtN (τ ) = sct P (τ̃tT ≤ τ ∧ τtC ≤ τ ) .
Note also that, at this point, we cannot present an exact relation using only
the CDFs of the involved random variables, as these are not independent.
Testing positive influences the individual’s probability of infecting others.

Care is needed when we consider single-individual random variables evaluated
on the source of a source-recipient pair, such as τ̃tT . Take, for example, the random
variable G. The probability that the recipient has severity g is again pg , because
each individual determines a unique source-recipient couple in which they are the
recipient. On the other hand, the probability that the source has severity g may be
different from pg . The more contagious individuals appear more often as sources
in source-recipient pairs, and the severity g is related to the number of people
they infect (which is why we have separated Rt as the weighted average of the
components Rt,g ). Using conditional probabilities, we can show that the probability
that the source in a source-recipient pair (with source infected at t) has severity g
is given by
(8)

p̃t,g = pg

Rt,g
.
Rt

Similarly, we can consider the other single-individual random variables and apply
them to the sources of source-recipient pairs. We denote with a tilde the CDFs of
the random variables obtained in this way. So, for example, we have
X
T
F̃tT (τ ) =
p̃t,g Ft,g
(τ )
g

for the probability that, given a source-recipient pair whose source was infected at
t, the source was tested within time τ from the infection. Note that here we used
T
T
the fact that F̃t,g
(τ ) = Ft,g
(τ ), due to our assumption in §2.2 that, given a value g
of severity, the number of infected people is independent from e.g. the fact of them
being tested or not.
Finally, we need the relation between the notification time τtN as seen by the
source I1 and the one τtA,c
as seen by the recipient I2 . This is given, in terms of
0
their CDFs, by averaging the latter over the times t0 at which I2 can be infected
A,c
by I1 (whose infection time t is instead fixed), and therefore, by integrating Ft+τ
0
0
(also shifted by τ to the right, to account for the difference in infection times of
the source and the recipient) with τ 0 measured by the CDF FtC . Thus, we have the
integral equation
Z
A,c
0
C 0
(9)
FtN (τ ) =
Ft+τ
0 (τ − τ )dFt (τ ) .
[0,+∞)

We have now a relation between τ S , τtA , τtT , but this involves different absolute
times t and cannot be solved explicitly. In the following subsection, we approximate

EFFECTIVENESS OF ISOLATION MEASURES TO CONTAIN EPIDEMICS

9

Eq. 9, which is the only step at which different absolute times are related, to be
able to write τtA in terms of τ S and τtT0 for some t0 < t.
Having analyzed the relations that determine the time evolution of the system,
we conclude by discussing the initial conditions. We suppose that the isolation
measures start at a given absolute time t0 . For simplicity, we assume this means
that all individuals infected at t < t0 will never take a test (even after t0 ) and never
self-isolate. As a consequence, the effective reproduction number is Rt0 for t < t0 ,
while it gets reduced as explained in §2.2 for t ≥ t0 . Therefore, individuals infected
at t = t0 can only be notified of the need to take a test through symptoms, so that
is constrained by (9) evaluated at t0 ≤ t < t0 .
F0A,c = 0. For t0 > t0 , FtA,c
0
Studying the existence and uniqueness of solutions of this system is beyond this
paper’s scope. We limit ourselves to producing from it an algorithm to generate
approximate solutions.
2.5. Approximating the time evolution. Now, we approximate equations (7)
and (9) to get some closed formulae, manageable for a numerical solution. First,
believing that individuals who test positive self-isolate efficiently enough (i.e. ξ is
close to one), we can assume that the probability that τ̃tT is smaller than τtC is
negligible, so that Eq. (7) is replaced by
FtN ' sct F̃tT .
Second, as τtC has a peaked PDF βt /Rt , we can approximate it in Eq. (9) with a
random variable concentrated in its average E(τtC ). Putting this all together, the
time evolution is now approximately described by
(10)

A,c
C
sct F̃tT (τ ) ' Ft+E(τ
C ) (τ − E(τt )) .
t

In practice, this approximation produces a simple iterative algorithm to construct
all the distributions. Having computed them up to an absolute time t, we can
P
compute Rt,g , F̃tT , then use this formula to get F̃tA,c
= g p̃t,g FtA,c
0
0 ,g and all the
other distributions at subsequent times t0 > t. Numerically, we can find the t00 such
that t0 = t00 + E(τtC00 ), and then compute
FtA,c
(τ ) ' sct00 FtT00 (τ + E(τtC00 )) .
0
Alternatively, this approximation can be seen as producing a discrete-time generative model, but where the generation time evolves with absolute time, and compute
the relevant metrics only at times t0 , t1 = t0 + E(τtC0 ), and so forth. This is indeed
what we do in §4.
3. The extended model including the use of an app for epidemic
suppression
So far, we have operated under the hypothesis that the ability to inform infected
people that their source has been infected can be described by a single parameter
sc . Now, let’s suppose that the population is divided into people who use an app
for epidemic control and people who do not. This forces us to complicate the model
of §2 because, when we analyze the distribution of the notification time τtA,c for
people with the app, we need to apply different weights to the cases in which the
source of the contagion has the app or does not. We also leave open the possibility
that people using the app may have a different probability ss of requiring a test
because of their symptoms.

3.1. Parameters and random variables in the two-component model. A
share papp
of the infected population, perhaps depending on the absolute time t,
t
uses an app that may do the following:
• It gives the users clear instructions on how to behave when they have symptoms indicative of the disease, assuming that this can increase the probability that an infected individual asks the health authorities to be tested
because of their symptoms.
• It notifies the users when they have had contact with an infected individual
who also uses the app, assuming that this can increase the probability that
an infected individual asks the health authorities to be tested because of
contact with an infected person.
app
We then distinguish sst,g into ss,app
and ss,no
, describing the probability that
g

an infected individual, respectively with or without the app, is notified of the need
to be tested given that they have symptoms with severity g. Note that

so that this distinction does not complicate the model, and is made only for adding
clarity in the computations.
The increased complexity of this situation lies in the fact that scg now has to be

recipient pair, the positive testing of the source causes a notification to the recipient,
respectively in the cases that both the source and the recipient have the app, and
that at least one of them does not have the app. Note that there is no relation
between sc,app and sc,no app and the general sct as simple as Eq. (11).
We also distinguish each random variable between people with the app and
people without it. For example, the time of notification due to contact now reads
τtA,c,app for people with the app and τtA,c,no app for people without it. The relation
between their improper CDFs is
A,c,no app
FtA,c = papp
FtA,c,app + (1 − papp

We have analogous formulae for τtT and τtA,s , while there is no need to make a
distinction for τ S .
Likewise, we have to separate Rt into two components Rtapp and Rtno app , namely,
the average number of people infected by someone infected at t and if the source
has or does not have the app, respectively:
no app
Rt = papp
Rtapp + (1 − papp
.

Analogous relations hold when restricted to individuals whose illness has a given
severity g.
Given a source-recipient pair in which the source was infected at time t, we
denote by p̃app
the probability that the source has the app. As with Eq. (8), this
t
is not the same as papp
t , as the average number of recipients is different when the
source does or does not have the app, but we have
p̃app
= papp
Rtapp /Rt .
t
t
When averaging the cases in which that the source has or does not have the app,
we use the coefficient p̃app
(with t equal to the time of infection of the source) in

pair tests positive has improper CDF given by

It is reasonable to assume that having or not having the app is independent of
symptom severity, so that, for example, the fraction of individuals infected at time
t using the app and with severity g is papp
t pg , and the analogous fraction regarding

3.2. The mathematical relations between the random variables. Now, we
can write the new relations between the random variables. Eq. (5) is replaced by
FgA,s,app = ss,app
FS ,
g

app S
FgA,s,no app = ss,no
F .
g

The relations (4), (6) immediately extend to each component.
The description of τ A,c,app and τ A,c,no app requires us to consider random variables on source-recipient pairs. We need to distinguish the notification time random variable τ N introduced in 2.4 in four random variables τ N,x,y with x, y ∈
{app, no app}, defined as the times at which the source notifies the recipient of
being infected, given that each individual does or does not have the app. The improper CDFs of these random variable are denoted accordingly. So, for example,
FtN,app,no app (τ ) is the probability that a source with the app, infected at t, notifies
a recipient without the app within a time τ from t. The general distribution is
recovered by weighting the probabilities that the source and the recipient do or do
not have the app:
FtN

=

N,app,no app
p̃app

t (1 − pt )Ft
app app N,no app,app

+(1 − p̃t )pt Ft
+ (1 − p̃app
.
t )(1 − pt )Ft

The same discussion applies to the contagion time τtC , even though, in the computations, we can use the aggregate distribution FtC only.
The case in which the recipient does not have the app is straightforward. It does
not require us to distinguish between the source having or not having the app:
app
FtN,x,no app (τ ) = sc,no
P (τtT,x ≤ τ ∧ τtC,x ≤ τ ) .
t

(12)

for any x ∈ {app, no app}. When the recipient has the app, we have a different
probability of notifications depending on whether or not the source also has it
FtN,app,app (τ )
N,no app,app

(τ )

(13)

= sc,app
P (τtT,app ≤ τ ∧ τtC,app ≤ τ ) ,

Eq. (9) now reads

3.3. Approximating the time evolution in the two-component model. As
with §2.5, we need to make some approximations to have closed formulae that can
be used in calculations. We neglect the possibility that a source infects other people
after testing positive, and we approximate Eq. (14) by taking in the integral the
contagion time τtC seen by the source as concentrated in its average E(τtC ).

4. Scenarios and results
In this section, we use the models introduced in §2 and §3 to numerically compute
the suppression of Rt due to isolation measures in certain scenarios.
The results reported here, as well as new custom calculations, can be obtained
by cloning the public Python repository [MM20].
4.1. General considerations. Some inputs of the algorithm developed are parameters or distributions describing the features of the epidemic under consideration. In this section, we focus on COVID-19, and we make the following assumptions, taking all the data from [FWK+ 20]:
• The incubation period τ S is distributed according to a log-normal distribution:
F S (τ ) = FN0,1 ((log(τ ) − µ)σ)
where FN0,1 denotes the CDF of the standard normal distribution. The
parameters µ = 1.64 and σ = 0.36 used here are taken from the same paper
(Table 1), and they imply that the mean incubation period is ' 5.5 days.
• The infectiousness distribution βt0 is assumed to depend on the absolute
time t only via a global factor, so that
βt0 (τ ) = Rt0 ρ0 (τ ) ,
where ρ0 (which also represents the default generation time distribution)
integrates to 1. It is described by a Weibull distribution with mean 5.00
and variance 3.61:
k  τ k−1 −(τ /λ)k
ρ0 (τ ) =
e
λ λ
with k = 2.855, λ = 5.611.
• We simplify the severity of symptoms by considering only two levels of
severity: g = sym and g = asy, respectively for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. We take asymptomatic individuals as 40%, and we

13

assume that they account for 5% of Rt . In formulae, this means that the
input parameters of our model are
psym = 0.6 ,
0
0 0
βt,sym
= 0.95
0.6 Rt ρ ,

pasy = 0.4 ,
0
0 0
βt,asy
= 0.05
0.4 Rt ρ .

All these assumptions hold throughout the whole section except for §4.2.3, where
we check how the results change using different epidemic data. The other parameters of the model, describing the isolation measures, are selected later.
As Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) describing the effectiveness of the isolation measures, we look at the reduction of Rt compared to the value Rt0 it would
take in the absence of measures. We call effectiveness of the isolation measures the
relative suppression of Rt0 :
(15)

Efft := 1 −

Rt
.
Rt0

Thus, Efft = 0 indicates that there is no effect on Rt0 , while Efft = 1 describes a
complete suppression of the contagion. As we noticed earlier in §2.2, the relative
suppression of Rt depends only on Rt0 via the shape function ρ0 , which we are now
considering fixed in absolute time, and the same for symptomatic and asymptomatic
individuals. Hence, attempts to model a realistic profile for Rt0 are irrelevant to our
computations, as any choice of Rt0 leads to the same Efft . Thus, we take
Rt0 = 1 .
Another KPI is the probability that an individual infected at a certain time t is
eventually found to be positive, namely the limit
FtT (∞) := lim FtT (τ ) .
τ →+∞

In the remainder of this section, we report the results of some selected calculations, considering both the “homogeneous” scenario of §2 and, in greater detail,
the scenario of §3, in which an app for epidemic control is used. First, we study
how the above KPIs evolve in time for certain input parameter choices. Then, we
focus on the limits for t → +∞ of these KPIs, i.e., their “stable” values after a
sufficient number of iterations, to study how these vary when we change certain
input parameters, leaving the others fixed.

4.2. Suppression of Rt with homogeneous isolation measures. First, we
perform some calculations in the setting of §2, where the isolation measures are
“homogeneous” within the whole population. We recall the parameters that describe this situation, some of which remain fixed in all the calculations:

Note that assuming that ∆A→T is a constant random variable means that we are
modeling that all individuals notified of the risk test positive, and take the same
time to do so. Although unrealistic, this assumption makes little difference to the
results. It is made here for simplicity, although it can be changed by using a more
realistic ∆A→T , when this datum is available.
4.2.1. Time evolution with isolation due to both symptoms and contact-tracing. We
now choose the following parameters, describing an optimistic situation, with reasonable efficiencies in spotting infected individuals:
Parameter value
sssym
0.5
sc
0.7
ξ
0.9
∆A→T

The results are shown in Fig. 1. Note that there is an immediate drop in Rt
at t = 0, as half of the symptomatic individuals are notified as soon as they show
some symptoms, and they then infect a reduced number of people. Subsequently,
Rt continues to decrease due to contact-tracing, quickly approaching its limit value
R∞ .
4.2.2. Dependency on testing timeliness. We now focus on the limit value Eff∞ ,
investigating its dependency on the time ∆A→T from a notification to the positive
result of the test (recall that we are assuming that ∆A→T is a constant random
variable).
Like in §4.2.1, the other parameters are fixed as follows:
Parameter value
sssym
0.5
sc
0.7
ξ
0.9
The result is plotted in Fig. 2. The effectiveness of the isolation measures improves dramatically with the ability to test (and then isolate) infected individuals
as soon as possible after their notification of possible infection.
4.2.3. Dependency on the epidemic data used. In this subsection we briefly explore
what happens if we change some of the data describing the epidemic, that were

introduced in §4.1 and used elsewhere in this section. This is done to see how Eff∞
depends on these data. The other parameters, describing the isolation measures,
are fixed as usual:

First, we let the fraction psym of symptomatic individuals vary, along with their

The value of Eff∞ for a few choices of psym and κ is plotted in Fig. 3, where it is
apparent how the result is robust with respect to changes in these input data.

Figure 3. Eff∞ for some values of psym and κ.
Second, we fix psym = 0.6 and κ = 0.95 as usual, and we modify instead the
density ρ0 of the default generation time, by replacing it with
1
ρ0f (τ ) = ρ0 (τ /f )
f
for f > 0. Note that this implies that the expected value of the default generation
time (denoted here by τ 0,C ) is multiplied by f :
E(τ 0,C ) = f (5 days) .
Fig. 4 depicts the relation between E(τ 0,C ) and Eff∞ , as f varies. As expected,
the isolation measures become more effective as the time taken by the infection to
be transmitted increases.

4.3. Suppression of Rt in the case of app usage. Now, we focus on applying
the model of §3 to study how Rt is suppressed when a fraction of the population
uses an app for epidemic control.
In this case, we summarize the input parameters in the following table, fixing
some of them to the given values for the rest of the section (unless explicitly mentioned).

4.3.1. Time evolution in an optimistic scenario. We start with an optimistic scenario, where the app is effective at recognizing infected individuals from symptoms
and contact-tracing information. The internal predictive models that estimate the
probability of an individual being infected have high efficiencies (a situation likely
bound to the possibility of training the predictive models on real data, in practice).
The app is adopted by a large fraction (60%) of the population, and is trusted, so
that most of the people notified take a test and self-isolate. The app also helps a
notified individual to get tested more quickly.6

6Studies such as [LGW+ 20] report that the time from symptom onset to testing through the
“conventional” channels (health care system) is in the order of several days. An app is expected to
have substantial chances to improve this performance, being a prompt-instrument by construction
(for example, when compared with the friction of calling a doctor, inserting symptom descriptions
into the app is likely easier), so that

As we start from Rt0 = 1, we reach a limit value of R∞ ' 0.79 for an effectiveness
of 0.21. The time evolution of Rt , along with the other main quantities of interest,
is shown in Fig. 5.

Figure 5. KPIs evolution in the optimistic scenario.

4.3.2. Time evolution in a pessimistic scenario. We now run an analogous computation in a “pessimistic” scenario. The app can only recognize infected individuals
from contact-tracing information, and not from symptoms (ss,app
sym consequently defaults to the no-app value). In addition, we assume a low efficiency sc,app = 0.5,
perhaps due to poor predictive models. Also, only 70% of those testing positive
self-isolate.

Even with a high app adoption rate (60% of the population), the effectiveness
drops dramatically. We get R∞ ' 0.95 and Eff∞ ' 0.05. Most notably, the app
does not change things much with respect to “standard” isolation measures. The
time evolution of Rt , along with the other main quantities of interest, is shown in
Fig. 6.

4.3.3. Time evolution in the case of gradual adoption of the app. Now, we study
the evolution of Rt in a scenario whereby the fraction papp

As shown in Fig. 7, Rt decreases until stabilizing again to the same value obtained
in §4.3.1, although it takes more time to do so. The limit values of the KPIs are
not changed by a gradual adoption of the app, compared with a prompt adoption.

4.3.7. Comments on the results. The examples provided in this section describe
how using an app for epidemic control is effective at suppressing Rt if it can spot
infected individuals quickly and efficiently. It performs better when utilizing both

EFFECTIVENESS OF ISOLATION MEASURES TO CONTAIN EPIDEMICS

25

symptom and contact-tracing information, when partnered by a healthcare system
with quick testing capabilities, and when adopted by a large proportion of the
population.
Being efficient at recognizing infected individuals means that the app should be
effective at spotting infections, maximizing the fraction of true-positives. To be
trusted by its users, it should also reduce the fraction of false-positives.
Any realistic scenario has lower bounds to the efficiencies in recognizing infected
individuals, coming from the “standard” measures used by healthcare systems to
find infected individuals. Past studies like [BMS+ 20][LGW+ 20] suggest that these
alternative measures may be less efficient (fewer truly infected individuals are recognized) and slower when compared to an app (usually, several days elapse between
symptom onset, the first medical visit, and the test outcome). We modeled these
lower-bound-efficiencies through the labeled “no app” parameters that have been
left to reasonably low values (20%).
