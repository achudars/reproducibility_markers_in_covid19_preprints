Abstract. The allocation of venture capital is one of the primary factors
determining who takes products to market, which startups succeed or
fail, and as such who gets to participate in the shaping of our collective
economy. While gender diversity contributes to startup success, most
funding is allocated to male-only entrepreneurial teams. In the wake of
COVID-19, 2020 is seeing a notable decline in funding to female and
mixed-gender teams, giving raise to an urgent need to study and correct
the longstanding gender bias in startup funding allocation.
We conduct an in-depth data analysis of over 48,000 companies on Crunchbase, comparing funding allocation based on the gender composition of
founding teams. Detailed findings across diverse industries and geographies are presented. Further, we construct machine learning models to
predict whether startups will reach an equity round, revealing the surprising finding that the CEO’s gender is the primary determining factor
for attaining funding. Policy implications for this pressing issue are discussed.
Keywords: gender bias · venture capital · diversity · entrepreneurship.

As gender equality continues to make strides across a wide range of industries
from STEM to medicine, there is a critical sphere where bias persists: Compared
to their male counterparts, women have little access to startup funds, restricting
them from engaging in our economy at this critical level. According to Pitchbook,
in 2019, female founders raised just 2.7% of the total venture capital funding
invested and mixed gender founding teams received 12.9% [1].
The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is having severe consequences for female entrepreneurs. Compared with 2019, the first quarter of 2020
saw a decline in the proportion of deals made with female and mixed-gender
teams and funding allocated to female teams. In the third quarter of 2020, funding given to female-only teams dropped to 1.8% with mixed-gender teams receiving just 11.1% [1]. There is an urgent need for understanding the nature of
this persistent bias and uncovering effective solutions for systemic change.
In the United States, only 10-15% of startups are founded by women [2]. Yet,
the number of women starting companies is not the primary issue, the far more

2

important problem is their lack of access to capital [3]. The funding gap between
male and female founders is particularly high at the early stage of a venture, with
an analysis of California and Massachusetts startups revealing that female-led
ventures are 63% less likely than male-led ones to obtain VC funding [4].
While it is generally well-known in the venture community that men have an
easier time raising funds, much remains unclear. In order to ascertain effective
solutions, it is necessary to gain insight into the nature of the problem. For instance, does having a woman on a founding team increase or decrease fundraising
outcomes? What role does the gender of the CEO play compared to the gender
of other founders? If funding is successfully raised, how does gender impact the
amount raised? How much does gender matter in different geographic regions
and across industries?
We perform an in-depth data analysis of over 48,000 companies on Crunchbase. Our analysis suggests the presence of bias against women across geographies and industries, which extends not only to female-only but also to mixedgender teams with female CEOs. We also construct machine-learning models
(Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosted Trees,
and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)) to predict whether a founding team will
reach a priced funding round.1 Our findings show the CEO’s2 gender to be the
most important founder characteristic for predicting fundraising success, beating critical features including whether the founders attended top universities and
the number of prior exits. We discuss the implications of these findings to the
utilization of machine learning models in venture capital allocation, and make
recommendations for systemic change.

Background

Gender plays a key role across the lifetime of an entrepreneurial journey: Women
are less likely to become entrepreneurs than men [5] and less likely to get external
funding once a new venture is founded [6]. The funding gap between male and
female founders is higher at the early stage of the venture than at later stages [7].
Women are 65% less likely to get funded at early stages and 35% less likely to
be funded at later stages, when strong signals of growth are available [4].
Consequently, women-owned businesses rely heavily on internal funding (ex.
personal finances) rather than funding from others, both debt and equity, to finance their firms [7]. Even though the number of women-owned firms is increasing rapidly [8], they are still left behind compared to their male counterparts in
receiving external founding.
Previous work provides valuable insight into the role of gender in the allocation of Venture Capital funds. However, the data used in previous studies,
such as those above, tends to be geographically limited (focusing on individual
countries, often the US), or consisting of only several hundred instances. Many

Raising a priced round is a major milestone that offers startups the means to succeed.
In startups, the role of CEO is most often taken by one of the founders. This is
nearly ubiquitous at early stages.

questions remain to be answered: How wide is the gender gap in the allocation
of venture capital funding across geographic regions and industries? Does gender
diversity help or hinder fundraising outcomes? Does the gender of the CEO play
a special role compared to other founders?
In order gain a broader understanding into the nature and prevalence of
gender bias in VC, we perform the most comprehensive analysis to date on the
impact of gender on startup funding across geographies and industry verticals,
utilizing both statistical methods and machine learning techniques. We are careful to account for the potential influence of the pipeline problem, whereby fewer
women seeking to engage in entrepreneurship.3 The data analysis helps inform
our policy recommendations, and we hope that it will support future research
on resolving gender bias in startup funding allocation.

Methodology

We rely on Crunchbase data to attain a data set of over 48,000 companies along
with founder information. We consider four gender compositions: founding teams
consisting entirely of male founders (male-only), founding teams consisting entirely of female founders (female-only), teams with at least one female and at
least one male founder led by a male CEO (mixed male-led), and teams with
at least one female and at least one male founder led by a female CEO (mixed
female-led). Companies with these gender and leadership compositions are subsequently compared, with emphasis on funding raised across a variety of industries
and geographies. We then construct machine learning models to ascertain the
importance of the team’s gender composition and the leader’s gender in funding
outcomes.
2.1

Data Collection

The data was obtained from Crunchbase, which prides itself for being “the leading destination for company insights from early-stage startups to the Fortune
1000.”4 Crunchbase provides two majors types of data: Information on companies and data on individuals in leadership positions. We separately retrieved
both types of data as they include some non-overlapping features. For instance,
gender information is only available as a founder attribute and is absent from
the company description.
Our final dataset is an integration of the company and founder data. We first
downloaded data of 224,000 companies and 175,000 founders with attributes of
interest to our analysis. We then combined the two datasets by matching the

The pipeline problem is often perceived as the primary cause of the gender gap in
startup funding allocation, suggesting that the gap would be eliminated if women
were as interested as men in pursuing entrepreneurship. We devise and apply analysis
methods that shed light into these issues in a manner that cannot be reduced to the
pipeline problem.

Company’s Website attribute in both the founders and companies dataset to
produce a new dataset of 63,462 data points. The combined dataset contains all
the attributes of the companies and all the aggregated attributes of the founders
dataset. We dropped all rows with missing values in the key attributed (headquarter region, total funding raised, and industry) and obtained a final dataset
of 48,676 entries. 58.14% of the companies are led by multi-member founding
teams. It is worth noting that companies ranked higher by Crunchbase tend to
have fewer missing values.
While not all founders are present in the founders dataset, founders names
are present in the company dataset as comma separated attributes. Whenever
a founder’s gender is missing from the founder data set, we rely on a machinelearning model for gender classification based on names.5
Another important aspect is identifying who is leading the startup. We define
the leader as either the CEO, or the sole founder for one person founding teams.
In order to determine leadership, we inspect the job titles of all of the founders
found on Crunchbase that have the company as their primary organization. We
set if the company is male or female led based on the gender of the identified
founder. Female-only and male-only companies are respectively female and male
led.
We reclassified the industries attribute values by reducing over one hundred
industries down to thirty by combining closely related industries, from amongst
which twenty industries with over 300 companies each were selected. We then
picked the first industry that each company provides as its primary industry.
The company’s headquarter region was used to identify its location.

Attribute Statistics

Before delving into extensive analysis, we share some basic statistics about the
data. As shown in Figure 1, overall founder gender distribution of the 48,676
companies in our dataset consists of 7.13% female-only companies, 80.22% maleonly companies, 3.26% mixed female-led companies, and 9.39% mixed male-led
companies (see Figure 1)

Our analysis includes 20 industries, each consisting of at least 300 companies
(See Figure 3 for the list of industries). We omit locations with fewer than
1,500 companies, resulting in three major geographic regions, consisted of North
America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Since 64.01% of companies are located in
North America, we also include a detailed analysis focusing on companies based
in the top four US startup hubs: Silicon Valley Bay Area, Greater New York
Area, Greater Los Angeles Area, and Greater Boston Area. Lastly, 94.84% of
the startups in our data were founded on or after the year 2000. Please see the
Appendix for additional information about the data set.

Data Analysis

In this section, we analyse the funding allocated to founding teams with different gender compositions. Results are reported across diverse industries and
geographic regions.
3.1

Analysis by industry

We begin with an analysis of funding allocation by industry across the 20 most
dominant industries identified in our data. As shown in Figure 3, there are far
more male-only companies than female-only and mixed-gender companies across
all industries. The industries Data, Commerce and Apps have the largest number of companies while Gaming, Agriculture and Farming and Administrative
Services have the fewest. In all but 5 out the 20 industries, the next biggest
category is male-led, mixed-gender groups.

6

Fig. 3. Number of companies for each gender composition type by industry.
All 20 industries are dominated by male-only teams.

As shown in Figure 4, male-only and male-led mixed-gender teams receive
the great majority of funding. In particular, male-only teams receive significantly 31 times more funding than female-only teams (statistic=11.0715, P <
0.0001). Male-only teams also get significantly 47 times more funding than
mixed-gender female-led teams (statistic=5.8197, P < 0.0001). Similarly, mixedgender male-led teams also receive significantly 8.5 times more funding than
mixed-gender female-led (statistic=3.5987, P < 0.0001) and female only teams
(statistic=4.2129, P < 0.0001).
Male-only teams receive more funding in 19 of the 20 industries. In 18 of the
20 industries, there is a significant difference between the amount raised by maleonly teams compared with female-only teams, the exceptions being agriculture &
farming and biotechnology, where the difference is not significant. On the other
hand, the difference between male-only and male-led is often insignificant, with
a significant difference found in only 4 of the 20 industries.
For example, in the Data industry, male-only teams get significantly more
funding than mixed female-led teams (statistic=6.0181, P < 0.0001), and female only teams (statistic=4.6942, P < 0.0001), and insignificantly more than
mixed male-led teams (statistic=0.6319, P = 0.5276). Similarly, in Commerce,
male-only teams get significantly more funding than mixed female-led teams
(statistic=3.4581, P = 0.0005) and female only teams (statistic=3.7047, P =
0.0002) and significantly more than mixed male-led teams (statistic=2.6360,

more funding than any other group type.

P = 0.0084). Of the industries studies, Food is the only one where male-only
teams did not raise the largest amount of total funding, however, the difference between male-only and mixed male-led teams was not significant (statistic=0.9567, P = 0.3427).
3.2

Average funding by industry

The pipeline problem, the fact that fewer women engage in entrepreneurship, is
often perceived as the primary factor in the discrepancy in funding allocation.
In order to gain insight into the nature of the issue beyond the pipeline problem,
we consider the average funding allocated to teams that have successfully raised
funds, comparing the amounts raised against the gender of the founding teams.
This analysis helps gain insight while offering an accessible demonstration of a
potential gender gap to lay audiences.
As shown on Figure 5, male-only founding teams and male led founding teams
lead in average funding, receiving the highest amount of average funding across
most industries (18 out 20). In 11 of the 20 industries, mixed-gender male-led

8

composition across industries. Values in hundreds of millions of USD. Of the 20
industries, average funding is highest for mixed-gender male-led teams in 11 industries
and for male-only teams in 7 industries.

team achieve the highest average funding, compared with 7 industries where
male-only teams raise the most average funding. In industries including Food
and Administrative Services there is a substantial gap between average funding
given to mixed male-led led teams and male-only, with the mixed teams raising
a greater amount of funding.
Of the twenty industries, there are only two industries (Energy and Education) where female-led teams receive more average funding. Notably, there
are no industries where female-only teams raise the greatest amount of average
funding. Unlike total funding, this persistent gap in average funding to startups that successfully raise funds cannot be explained by low numbers of women
entrepreneurs.
Comparing companies led by women, we find that in 9 of the 20 industries
female-only teams receive more average funding than mixed-gender female-led
startups.
3.3

Analysis by geography

Considering average funding allocation, shown in Figure 6, we see the same raking by average funding allocation across all continents, with female-only teams

Fig. 6. Average funding allocation to founding teams with different gender
composition across dominant continents. Values in hundreds of millions of USD.
All continents under consideration reveal the same raking, with male-led mixed-gender
teams receiving the highest average funding, followed by male-only teams, then femaleled mixed-gender teams, and finally female-only teams receiving the lowest amount of
average funding.

receiving the lowest average funding, followed by female-led mixed-gender teams,
then male-only teams, and finally mixed-gender male-led teams receiving the
highest amount of average capital.
Analyzing startup hubs in the United States, shown in 7, we discover that
in Silicon Valley and New York male-only teams receive the highest average
funding, narrowing beating mixed-gender male-led teams. LA and Boston follow
the global trend of giving mixed-gender male-led teams the highest amounts of
average funding, followed by male-only teams. In Silicon Valley, New York, and
LA, female-only teams receive the least amount of average funding, followed by
mixed female-led teams. However, in Boston, female-only teams receive more
average funding than mixed-gender female-led teams.
In summary, companies with male CEOs receive greater funding across all
continents and US startup hubs compared with companies with female CEOs.
Mixed-gender teams perform well with respect to fundraising, often better than
male-only teams, when they are led by male-CEOs.
When comparing total funding for different gender composition teams across
continents (see Figure 8), we find that mixed-gender teams receive the great
majority of funding in the three continents considered. Europe appears to be exhibiting the greatest preference for male-only teams, where such groups receive
significantly over 65.5 times more funding than female-only companies (statistic=6.5061, P < 0.0001). European male-only teams raise significantly 92.9 more

groups (statistic=2.0306, P = 0.0427). Male-only companies in Europe raise nonsignificantly 6 times more total funding than mixed-gender teams led by men
(statistic=0.6232, P = 0.5327).
In Asia-Pacific, male-only companies receive significantly over 37 times more
funding than female-only companies (statistic=5.1950, P < 0.0001). Male-only
teams raise insignificantly over 43 times more than mixed-gender female led
teams (statistic=1.0063, P = 0.3157). Comparing mixed gender teams, those
led by men raise insignificantly 12 times more funding than female-led groups
(statistic=1.8761, P = 0.0611). Finally, male only teams raise 3.5 time more
than male-led mixed-gender teams, not statistically significant (statistic=1.6322,
P = 0.1032).
When looking at total funding for different gender composition teams across
US startup hubs (see Figure 9), similar to the continental analysis, male only
teams receive the great majority of funding for the four major hubs. Silicon
Valley exhibits some of the greatest preference for male founders, with male-only
companies receiving significantly over 27 times more funding than female-only
companies (statistic=2.9081, P < 0.0038) and significantly over 35 times more
than mixed-gender female-led companies (statistic=2.7921, P < 0.0054).
In Los Angeles Area, male-only companies significantly receive over 23 times
more funding than female-only companies (statistic=3.3092, P < 0.0010). Comparing male-only to mixed female-led companies, male-only raised insignificantly
over 30 times more (statistic=1.0888, P = 0.2787). New York gives male-only
companies over 21 times more funding than female-only companies

12

C. Cassion et al.

(statistic=6.8847, P < 0.0001) and over 37 times more than mixed-gender femaleled companies (statistic=3.4533, P = 0.0006), both results being significant.
Finally, analysis of Boston area shows that male-only companies receive
about 16 times more funding than female-only companies (statistic=1.8629,
P < 0.0639) and about 41 times more than mixed-gender female-led companies
(statistic=1.4243, P < 0.1599), however here the results were not significant.

Predictive Models

Venture capitalists’ primary aim is to identify startups that will become successful in the future. As such, machine learning models have been playing an
increasingly important role in the venture capital space (see, for example, [9],
[10] and [11]).6 While predictive models can be used at any stage of investment, the problem is particularly challenging for early stage startups, prior to
the availability of qualitative data on company performance. Prediction for later
stage startups benefit from information on factors such as revenue and growth,
making prediction significantly more accurate. On the other hand, early stage
investments, which are often pre-revenue and precede product market fit, rely
primarily on founder characteristics.
One of primary risks with the utilization of machine learning models from an
ethical perspective is the perpetuation and even amplification of existing biases.
For instance, in the context of credit markets, Black and Hispanic borrowers are
disproportionately less likely to gain from the introduction of machine learning
[12].
How much gender bias is present in startup data? To what degree does the
utilization of machine learning models stands to perpetuate, or even amplify, gender bias in venture capital? We explore this direction by creating several machine
learning models based on founder characteristics, the dominant characteristics
available for early stage investments. We then analyze feature importance to
ascertain how much the predictions rely on the gender composition of founding
teams and the gender of the CEOs. Note that our exploration differs significantly from prior work in predictive modeling for startup success, since we are
interested specifically in the importance of gender for attaining a priced funding
round. By contrast, most work in the field aims to predict startup success by incorporating information about the startup itself, including quantitative success
indicators such as total funding raised and number of employees.
4.1

Feature Selection

In order to ascertain investor behaviour prior to having clear success indicators available, we focus exclusively on founder characteristics7. However, it is

Further, many venture capital firms built their own custom models which they do
not make public in order to maintain a competitive advantage.
As mention above, while a gender gap exits at all startup stages, investors are most
reluctant to invest in women in the early stages, where female ventures are 65% less
likely to receive funding [4]

Investors Embrace Gender Diversity, Not Female CEOs

13

essential to avoid including features that would be heavily altered by the target
variable. For instance, social media presence stands to alter for founders who
successfully raised funding. Similarly, information regarding investments made
by the founders is heavily influenced by their entrepreneurial success, and are as
such also omitted.
Training Features To build the model, we first extract a set of features related
to the founders from the aggregated dataset discussed in Methodology. The
following features have been selected:
– Male Led: Boolean variable that is True if the CEO or sole founder is Male,
False otherwise
– Gender Composition: If the founding team is male-only, female-only,
mixed male-led, or mixed female-led
– Total Previously Founded Organizations: Total number of companies
previously founded by members of the founding team
– Average Previously Founded Organizations: The average number of
companies previously founded by the founders
– Has Previously Founded Organizations: Boolean variable indicating
True if any of the founders previously founded an organization
– Total Number of Exits: Total number of exit events in which the founders
participated
– Average Number of Exits: Average number of exit events for the company founders
– Has Exits: Boolean variable indicating True if any of the founders had
previously founded a company that had an exit event
– Total Number of Founders: Number of founders of the company
– Multiple Founders: Boolean variable set to True if the founding team
consists of two or more founders
– Same Alma Mater: Boolean variable indicating True if all of the founders
went to the same university, False otherwise
– % from Top School: Percentage of founders that went to a top 100 school
[13]
– Top School Attended: Boolean variable set to True if any of the founders
went to a top 100 school[13]
Target Feature The goal of these experiments is to determine if a startup
reached an equity funding round based on its founders. An equity round is when
a startup sells shares of the startup in exchange for a large investment (generally
well over a million). Equity rounds are important to the life cycle of startups
largely because they provide a significant monetary influx into the company and
represents a vote of confidence from the Venture Capital community, which helps
with subsequent rounds.
We separate the dataset into two funding stage groups, pre-equity rounds and
post-equity rounds. We define pre-equity rounds as those whose latest funding

14

C. Cassion et al.

stage is an Angel Round, Pre-Seed, Seed Round, or Convertible Note. We define
post-equity rounds as those that whose latest funding stage is Series A, Series
B or beyond, or Corporate Rounds. Using that, we construct models to predict
whether a founding team has reached a priced round.

Model Analysis

Using hyperparameter grid-search to obtain the best model of each type, we
constructed the following models: (1) Decision Tree (DT), (2) Random Forest,
(3) Logistic Regression (LR), (4) Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT), and (5) Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), for each of the worldwide and US data. MLP had the
highest accuracy on worldwide data, at 63.73%. Similar results were found for
US data with MLP giving the highest accuracy of 63.61%. Figure 1 and Figure
4 summarize the results for worldwide and US data, respectively. All models
performed comparably, with worldwide accuracies varying by only 0.86%.

Early stage predictions are known to be highly challenging. It is essential to
emphasize that no information about the companies has been provided beyond
founder features, in order to ascertain the impact of gender on early stage investing. It is unlikely that much higher accuracy is possible without incorporating
features beyond the scope of founder characteristics.

attended top schools. Table 4 and Table 3 detail the feature importance for the
Decision Tree and Random Forest models.8 The results show that whether a
company is led by a male CEO is by far the most important feature in the decision tree model, and also the top feature in the random forest model for both
the worldwide and US-only datasets.

Table 4. Predictive model feature importance on US data. According to both
the decision tree and random forest models, the most important feature for reaching a
priced round in the US is whether the company consists of only male founders.

For the Gradient Boosted Tree (GBT) model on US data, the top 5 features
are ranked as follows: whether the founding team is male-only (14.46%), number
of founders (13.04%), percent of founders from top schools (12.03%), number of
exits (11.46%), and if all the founders have graduated from the same university
(10.07%). For the worldwide GBT model, where GBT achieved the second lowest
accuracy of the models created, the top feature is the number of founders.
In summary, feature importance analysis for the tree-based models indicates
that in most instances, for both worldwide and US-only datasets, gender is key

We report feature importance for the interpretable tree-based models, emphasizing
that all models obtained comparable accuracy. Importance analysis for other models

to fundraising success. We find that the main indicator of whether a startup will
reach a priced funding round centers on gender, either the gender of the CEO
or whether the team consists entirely of male founders.

Conclusions and Recommendations

Our analysis suggests the presence of a pervasive and substantial bias against
female-led startups across geographies and industries. Looking at average funding, where only startups that have raised funds are considered, lets us eliminate
the pipeline problem as a a primary explanation for discrepancies in funding
allocation. The analysis reveals that, across all but 2 of the 20 industries considered, male-led teams received the highest average funding. Across all three
continents in our analysis, North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, the highest
average funding went to mixed-gender teams led by male CEOs. In all three
continents, the least average funding went to female-only teams, followed by
female-led mixed-gender teams.
Among US startup hubs, Silicon Valley and New York gave the highest average funding to male-only teams, while LA and Boston gave greatest average
support to mixed-gender teams led by male CEOs. As in the continental analysis,
female-only teams receive the lowest average funding, following by mixed-gender
teams with female CEOS.
Our ML-based analysis reveals gender characteristics to be of highest importance amongst founder features for reaching a prices round, in particular,
more important that traditionally prized characteristics pertaining to whether
the founders have attended top universities or had prior exits. Worldwide analysis reveals the gender of the CEO to the most important feature. On US data,
machine learning modelling shows that the most important characteristic tends
to be whether all founders are male.
In summary, we find that across all geographic regions and the great majority
of industries, companies a male CEO have much better funding outcomes those
with female CEO. The gender of the CEO appears to be the most important
factor in fundraising. With no exceptions across geographies and industries, our
results show that startups led by male CEOs raise more money than startups
raised by female CEOs, irrespective of the gender of the rest of the founding
team. On the other hand, having women as founders but not CEOs improves
funding results in some (but not all) cases, sometimes by a substantial margin.
Across all geographies (but not all industries), female-led companies achieve
better funding outcomes when they include a male co-founder.

particular, gender composition was found to be more important than characteristics that are known to be prized by venture capitalists, such as the number of
prior exits or the founder’s alma mater. This surprising finding not only reveals
the primary role of gender in venture capital allocation, but also warns of potential pitfalls when applying machine learning models to investment decisions.
Machine learning models in other spheres, such as credit markets, have already been shown to inflate biases [12]. We recommend exercising caution when
building machine learning models for startup success prediction, in order to reduce the impact of gender on the resultant decision making. Most importantly,
features directly capturing the gender of the founders should be omitted.9
Further, we observe that features such as prior exits, while not directly capturing bias, may play an important role in perpetuating it. With longstanding
low access to startup funding, women have much lower chances of having had
previous exits.

Discussion and policy implications

One of the most important findings of this analysis is the critical role of a CEO’s
gender for fundraising outcomes, even in mixed-gender teams. This is notable
because in startups, particularly at early stages, division of labour amongst
founder is a less clear cut than in mature companies. Thus, it unlikely that
a mixed-gender company’s performances in terms of investor returns will be
impacted on the basis of whether a male or female co-founder is designated as
the CEO.
Yet, fundraising is often handled by the CEO, making the founder identified
as such the primary link between the startup and any potential investors. Even
when other founders are present, the CEO is expected to lead the discussion
on behalf of their startup. Consequently, any bias against women, implicit or
otherwise, is likely to manifest most strongly if the CEO is female.
The critical role of the CEO in funding outcomes may thus be reduced to
differences in how investors treat men and women. Prior research points to desperate treatment of men and women during startup pitches. In a study on interactions at TechCrunch Disrupt in New York City, investors asked men to
expand on how the plan to reach success, whereas women were asked to defend themselves against failure [14], which hindered women’s ability to raise
funds. Notably, both male and female investors exhibited this bias against female founders.10 Further research is needed to elucidate the impact of implicit

Gender information has been incorporated into previous ML models for startup
success, see, for example [11].
There is a prevalent notion that the key to eradicating gender bias in startup investing lies in increasing the number of female investors. This view is oversimplified
and potentially misleading. Both men and women are highly prone to bias against
women [15]. While increasing gender diversity amongst investors is important for
a variety of reasons, tackling gender bias against female founders calls for more
comprehensive solutions.

gender bias on fundraising outcomes and uncover the reasons behind ubiquitous
lower propensity towards investing in female CEOs across the globe.
Our findings show that across all continents considered and some US startups hub mixed-gender are given higher average funding, when they are male-led.
This likely stems from the inherent advantage of mixed gender teams. Gender
balanced teams perform better than male-dominated teams in terms of sales and
profits [16], and gender diverse executives teams are 21% more likely to yield
higher financial returns [17]. The venture capital firm First Round reported that
their investments in companies with at least one female founder were meaningfully outperforming their investments in all-male teams [18]. In fact, their
investment in companies with a female founder performed 63% better than their
investments with all-male founding teams [18].
The benefit of a gender diversity helps mixed-gender teams raise funding,
but only when they are led by a male CEO. The consistently lower funding
allocation, both in total and on average, to mixed-gender teams when they are
led by women CEOs points to the severity of gender bias in startup capital
allocation.
In recent years, a number of Venture Capital firms emerged with the mandate
to invest in teams with at least one female founder. However, these investment
firms tend to be (1) late stage, and (2) utilize a “follow” investment strategy,
investing only after another VC firm makes a substantial investment and sets
the deal terms. This does little to help increase the number of female founders.
Our findings suggest that importance of investing in female-led companies
to correct the gender bias in capital allocation. We recommend the formation
of venture capital firms with the mandate to invest in companies with female
CEOs. Investing in women-led, mixed-gender teams should allow investors to
benefit from the performance boost of gender diversity, while helping to correct
the long standing bias against female business leaders. Investors with expertise
to lead early stage deals applying such practiced can further reap the benefit of
early investing, receiving large equity in promising deals.
