Abstract: COVID-19 is a new type of coronavirus disease which is caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It originated in China in the month of
December 2019 and quickly started to spread within the country. On 31st December 2019, it
was first reported to country office of World Health Organization (WHO) in China. Since then,
it has spread to most of the countries around the globe. However, there has been a recent rise
in trend in believing that it would go away during summer days, which has not yet been
properly investigated. In this paper, relationship of daily number of confirmed cases of
COVID-19 with three environmental factors, viz. maximum relative humidity (RHmax),
maximum temperature (Tmax) and highest wind speed (WSmax), considering the incubation
period, have been investigated statistically, for four of the most affected places of China, viz.
Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, Wuhan and five of the most affected places of Italy, viz.
Bergamo, Cremona, Lodi, Milano. It has been found that the relationship with maximum
relative humidity and highest wind is mostly negligible, whereas relationship with maximum
temperature is ranging between negligible to moderate.
Keywords: Coronavirus, COVID-19, Environmental factors
Introduction: Over the years, many different viruses of coronavirus family have surfaced and
disrupted life of a lot of people. In 2002, a new disease called Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) started from Guangdong province of China. In 2003 it was found that, the
disease is caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and it quickly became an epidemic,

affecting life of more than 8000 people in 26 different countries [1]. In 2012, another disease
called called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), caused by MERS coronavirus
(MERS-CoV), started from Saudi Arabia, became an epidemic and spread to 27 countries [2].
In the later part of 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause started appearing in
Wuhan, China and was reported to the Country Office of WHO in China on 31st December
2019. On 30th January 2020, it was declared as Public Health Emergency of International
Concern. On 11th February 2020, WHO named the disease as coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
and the virus causing the disease as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) [3]⁠. On 11th March 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 as pandemic [4] and by 16th
March 2020, the virus has spread to 156 countries/regions [5]⁠.
From 19th January 2020 onwards, there has been hearsay about relationship between
coronavirus and summer [6]⁠. However, there has been a sharp rise in interest shown by people
all around the world, in the relationship, as shown by Google Trend [6]⁠, after President of the
United States of America, who is currently one of the most influential person in the world [7]⁠,
tweeted that the virus might be gone with warmer weather [8]⁠. If such claims are not properly
investigated then it might end up being rumour and ultimately hinder the disease control
process [9]⁠, which has not yet been done widely.
One of the terms to describe severity of any infectious disease is effective reproduction
number (R) [10]. Wang et al., tried to develop an equation to estimate the value of R with
respect to the value of Temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) [11], but they developed
the equation based on data only from Chinese cities and applied that for places outside China.
However, the environment and their effect are different at different places of the globe and the
effect of incubation period has also not been considered while developing the equation.
Incubation period of COVID-19 has been investigated by Baum et al. and it has been found
that the median incubation period is approximately 5 days [12]. In the current paper, the

relationship of daily number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, which has been assumed to be
reflecting how contagious the disease is, from four of the most affected places of China and
five of the most affected places of Italy has been investigated with RHmax, Tmax and WSmax. The
environmental factors, that have been considered, are that of 5 days back from the date of
reporting the case, to consider the effect of incubation period.
Methodology: Since 21st January, WHO has been publishing daily situation report on COVID19 [13]. The data for the Chinese places has been collected from these reports and has been
summarised in Table 1. All the weather data, reported in Table 1, have been collected from
Weather Underground [14]

Similarly, the data for Italy has been collected from the official GitHub repository of
Department of Civil Protection, Italy [15] and the summary is presented in Table 2 along with
weather data which is obtained from Weather Underground [14].

Once the data has been collected, then to find out how well the daily number of newly
confirmed cases of COVID-19 relates to RHmax, Tmax and WSmax, at first the daily number of
cases is plotted against each one of the considered environmental factor and visually inspected,
then Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) for each such pair has been calculated [16] using
MATLAB (R2019b). After that, the each of the values are interpreted according to the rule of
thumb mentioned by Mukaka [17].
To further strengthen the finding, hypothesis test has also been done on them using 95%
confidence interval. Null hypothesis, for each such pair, being that the environmental factors
do not influence the spread of disease. But, while testing hypothesis, the results are not
interpreted depending only on the p-values, as cautioned by Wasserstein et al. [18]. Instead
1

Bayes Factor (BF), for each one of them is calculated using the expression − 𝑒𝑝 ln(𝑝) [19] and
then the relationship is once again interpreted based on the value of BF as mentioned in the
classification scheme by Jamil et al. [20].
Results and discussion: From figure 1 – 27, it can be seen that the influence of environmental
factors is neither that strong nor that can be outrightly rejected.
The value and interpretation of Pearson’s correlation coefficient and Bayes Factor is
listed in Table 3.

Conclusion: COVID-19 started in the month of December 2019, from China and is rapidly
spreading to different countries of the world. Millions of people have already been infected by
the virus SARS-CoV-2. Amidst the commotion, a belief is getting popular that the virus would
die its own death with the arrival of summer season, but in the current paper, it has been found
that the relationship between the effectiveness of virus and different environmental factors is
not that strong. Hence, it can be concluded that the virus shows no sign as of now, to become
dormant during summer days. The current piece of work is based on preliminary data that’s
available. A better relation can be predicted when more data become available.
