Abstract—— Contact tracing apps are powerful software tools
that can help control the spread of COVID-19. In this article, we
evaluated 53 COVID-19 contact tracing apps found on the Google
Play Store in terms of their usage, rating, access permission, and
user privacy. For each app included in the study, we identified the
country of origin, number of downloads, and access permissions
to further understand the attributes and ratings of the apps. Our
results show that contact tracing apps had low overall ratings and
nearly 40% of the included apps were requesting “dangerous
access permission” including access to storage, media files, and
camera permissions. We also found that user adoption rates were
inversely correlated to access permission requirements. To the best
of our knowledge, our article summarizes the most extensive
collection of contact tracing apps for COVID-19. We recommend
that future contact tracing apps should be more transparent in
permission requirements and should provide justification for
permissions requested to preserve the app users’ privacy.

I. INTRODUCTION
The global outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) has caused unprecedented health, social, and
economic effect on mankind [1]. The COVID-19 disease,
caused by novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has spread
rapidly from person to person (i.e., being in close contact,
through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or
touching nose or eyes after touching infected objects, or other
media) around the world which mainly caused severe
respiratory illness to the infected person [2]. Considering the
severity of this disease, The World Health Organization
(WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic on
March 12, 2020 [3]. As of August 07, 2020, more than 19
million people have been infected, and nearly 720000
fatalities resulted from COVID-19 [4].
For the containment of the COVID-19, the WHO
recommended people to practice simple precautions like hand
washing, covering the mouth and nose by wearing appropriate
masks, practicing physical distancing of one meter (three
feet), and avoid large group gatherings [5]. At the same time,
tremendous effort from the scientific community has been
invested in discovering treatments, including antiviral drugs,
and vaccines. Although no effective medications or vaccines
have been discovered so far, to eradicate the COVID-19,
different pharmaceutical prophylaxis and treatment such as
Dexamethasone, Remdesivir, and few others are tested for
their efficacy [6]. Many other attempts are underway to
discover an effective vaccine, as well [7]. As of July 2020,
more than 25 candidate vaccines for COVID-19 are at
different phases of clinical trials [8]. In fact, the vaccine
development is a lengthy, laborious, and expensive process
[9], and the whole world is waiting for an effective vaccine to
come out to eradicate this disease.
With the above backdrop and the lack of effective
therapeutic solutions against COVID-19, contact tracing

mobile apps could be considered as a viable option to control
or minimize the spread of the COVID-19. These days usage
of mobile technologies has grown rapidly with the increasing
usage of mobile electronic devices such as smartphones. As
part of controlling the spread of COVID-19, contract tracing
apps for smart mobile phones are already implemented in
different countries [10]. Those apps are defined as mobile
software applications that use digital contact tracing in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These apps are already
rolled out to identify people who were in close contact with
other infected persons, to alert them to step away, daily
updates on the census for the COVID-19 cases according to
their locations, and necessary safeguarding instructions from
the government [11].
As the number of contact tracing apps is surging, it is
essential to understand its usage, ratings, permission, and
privacy setting to understand users’ adoption. Lalmuanawma
et al. summarize the contribution of artificial intelligence (AI)
in combating COVID-19 [12] and mentioned a list of 36

COVID-19 related apps. Li and Guo analyzed the flaw and
data privacy issue of 10 contact-tracing apps [13]. Ahmed et
al. analyzed 15 contact tracing apps covering their system
architecture, location estimation system, data management,
privacy, and security vulnerability [14]. Sun et al. summarized

But the existing review articles on COVID-19 contact
tracing apps covered either too few numbers of contract
tracing apps, or they considered only privacy aspects of the
apps without describing other relevant aspects like ratings,
downloads, and permission details. This study aims to analyze
the existing COVID-19 contact tracing apps in terms of their
usage, rating, access permission, and user privacy. To the best
of our knowledge, this article covers the largest number of
contact tracing apps for COVID-19.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Collection of Contact Tracing Apps
To collect a list of COVID-19 contract tracing apps, we
searched for apps that have been officially released by
different countries. We searched for existing literature in
PubMed and Google Scholar. Some contact tracing apps (e.g.,
Ehteraz, Covi-ID, and many others) are released into Google
Play Store without corresponding research articles published;
therefore, for those contact tracing apps, we also searched the
Google Play Store. As of August 10, 2020, we were able to
collect a list of 53 contact tracing apps from 53 countries
(Table II).
B. Metadata Extraction for the Selected Contact Tracing
Apps
We collected the metadata for each contact tracing app
from Google Play Store, such as a short description,
categories, average rating, number of users who rated the app,
last update version, size, number of installations, current
version, required android version, access permissions,
developed by, privacy policy website, and application website
from Google Play Store. Supplementary Table 1 provides the
details of this metadata for each app.
C. Mapping of Google Play Store Permissions into Android
Dangerous Permissions
Google provides a list of permissions corresponding to
individual apps, with a purpose to protect the privacy of the
user. These permissions are divided into different
subcategories. To determine the protection level of these
android apps, we considered the Android permission levels
[17] and mapped them to Google Play Store permissions
available from the app metadata. Owing to the fact that we did
not use the source codes of android apps, thus, to overcome
this issue between manually gathering of permissions rather
than source code analysis, we mapped the dangerous android
permissions as mentioned in documentation to Google Play
permissions considering that they mean same according to
descriptions provided by each one. These mapping could be
observed in Supplementary Table 2.
TABLE II.

D. Correlation analysis between app permissions and
ratings and download
Correlation analysis, along with statistical significance, of
apps permission and corresponding ratings and normalized
number of downloads considering the population size of
respective countries were computed using the SPSS software.
III. RESULTS
A. Category of Contact Tracing Apps
The list of contact tracing apps mainly belonged to four
categories: (a) health & fitness (n=25), (b) medical (n=22), (c)
lifestyle (n=3), and (d) social (n=2) (Fig. 1). We found only
one contact tracing app MorChana, from Thailand, which was
under the category of the tool. From Fig. 1, we noticed that the
lifestyle group had the highest average rating equal to 3.8,
followed by the health and fitness group with an average
rating equal to 3.7, then medical group with an average rating
equal to 3.6, and the social group with an average rating equal
to 3.5.
B. Download statistics of Contact Tracing Apps
Fig. 2 illustrates the rating of contact tracing apps and the
number of downloads for the apps. We observed that the
contact tracing apps in the health & fitness category have the
highest number of downloads among all apps. Interestingly
we found that the Aarogya Setu app developed for India had
the highest number of downloads by more than 100 million
users, followed by Coron App developed for Colombia having
more than 10 million downloads. Corona Warn App, Hayat
Eve Sigar, CUIDAR COVID-19 developed for Germany,
Turkey, and Argentina respectively were downloaded by more
than 5 million.
On the other hand, the lowest number of app installs
was Corona 360 developed for South Korea had only 100
downloads, followed by Covi-ID developed for South Africa
having 500 downloaded. CovTracer, GH Covid-19 Tracker
App, Best Covid Gibraltar, and Kenya Covid-19 Tracker
developed for Cyprus, Ghana, Gibraltar and Kenya,
respectively had over 1000 plus downloads only.

The normalized number of downloads for BruHealth app
developed for Brunei (23.1%), Coron App developed for
Colombia (19.9%), and TraceTogether developed for
Singapore (17.5%) were higher compared to other apps. The
normalized number of downloads for Corona 360 developed
for South Korea (0.0002%), Covi-ID developed for South
Africa (0.0009%), and Kenya Covid-19 Tracker developed for
Kenya (0.0019%) were lower compared to other apps.
C. App Permissions and Android Versions
App permissions in Google Play Store have been
categorized according to the android version. For Android 5.1
and lower, there are 16 permissions groups, while for android
6.0 and higher, there are nine permissions groups
(Supplementary Table 2). Some permissions are not
categorized in the permissions group, so we categorized them
as “other” [18]. Furthermore, users who use Android 6.0 and
higher can control which permission group can access device
information [19]. After the user downloads an application
from Google Play Store by using Android 6.0 and higher each
permission group will be shown separately, and the user can
control which permission can access the device information
[19]. Whereas in Android 5.1 and lower, a list of permissions
groups are shown before downloading the application, and the
user can accept all the permissions groups and download the
app or decline it and the app will not be downloaded [18].
From the pool of 53 contact tracing apps, we found that 27
apps are suitable for Android version 5.0 and higher (Fig. 3).

D. Overview of Access Permissions for Contact Tracing
Apps
Fig. 4 summarizes the access permission requested by the
53 contact tracings apps. As shown in Fig. 4, all contact
tracing apps require full network access permission. Most
apps require access to view network connection (n=52) and
prevent devices from sleep (n=46). About three-quarters of
apps require access to run at startup (n=40) and pair with
Bluetooth devices (n=40). Approximately 71.1% of apps
require access to the location (n=38) and receive data from the
internet (n=38). Nearly half of the apps require Bluetooth
access (n=28). More than 30% contact tracing apps require
access to storage (n=20), photo/media/file (n=20) and camera
(n=16).
The least frequently access permissions were control
vibration (n=14), Wi-Fi connection information (n=13),
device and app history (n=7), phone (n=6), device ID and call
information (n=4), draw over other apps (n=4), Google Play
license check (n=4), contacts (n=3), change network

read Google service configuration (n=3), microphone (n=2),
create accounts and set passwords (n=2), read sync settings
(n=2), toggle sync on and off (n=2). Only 1.9% of apps require
to access change your audio settings (n=1), disable your
screen lock (n=1), send sticky broadcast (n=1), set an alarm
(n=1), control flashlight (n=1), uninstall shortcuts (n=1),
install shortcuts (n=1), and calendar (n=1).

dangerous permissions withhold great importance as they
could lead to potential privacy-data breaches [21]. Table III
shows the percentage of potentially dangerous permission
requests [17] made by contact tracing apps. For the purpose of
COVID-19 contact tracing, the location permission is of great
importance as the app could alert a user when he/she is in close
contact with an infected person. But more than 30% of contact
tracing apps require read/write access to USB storage and
multimedia (photo/media/file), which may raise a great
concern for the app users.

F. Correlation analysis between contact tracing apps
permission and ratings and downloads
Correlation between the app’s permission and
corresponding rating and downloads were computed (Table
4). From Table IV, we can observe that both ratings and
downloads were inversely related to the dangerous
permissions like location, storage, photos/media/files. The
contact tracing apps with dangerous permission, storage had
lower downloads (correlation: -0.18; p-value:0.11). The
number of downloads is lower for the apps having
photos/media/files permission (correlation: -0.18; pvalue:0.11). A similar trend was observed for the apps
requiring wi-fi connection information (correlation: -0.10; pvalue:0.24), though the correlation was not statistically
significant.

IV. DISCUSSIONS
This article aimed to provide an overview of the COVID19 contact tracing apps, including the permissions mentioned
in the Google Play Store for the corresponding apps. Based on
our analysis, we found that the average ratings for the contact
tracing apps are not very high. The highest average rating for
contact tracing apps was 3.8; this indicates the existence of
avenues that need to be addressed by the developers and
policymakers to improve the user adoption and rating for the
apps. Most of the contact tracing apps were supporting
Android version 5.0 and above. If the apps were compatible
with the older version of Android as well, then we could
expect more downloads as some of the Android users may not
update their system for a long time.
The Number of downloads was varying for the contact
tracing apps from country to country. On the higher side, we
noticed 5-100 million downloads, and on the lower end, we
observed only a few hundred downloads. Additionally,
smartphone penetration is low in lower-to-middle income
countries (e.g., Bangladesh, India, Pakistan), which may
disenfranchise a certain group of population in lower-tomiddle income countries. For the containment of COVID-19,
successful outreach for contact tracing apps is mandatory;
otherwise, a certain group of the population might be left
without the app, causing a different rate of infection. So, we
would recommend investigating the driving force for the
installation of contact tracing apps across different countries.
Interestingly, some contact tracing apps were requiring
access to set the alarm, flashlight, set shortcut which was
entirely unnecessary for contact tracing. Also, apps that
require access to photos/media/files can read sensitive log
data, web bookmarks, and history or retrieve internal system
state and running apps [18], [22]. As a result, an inverse
relationship between the dangerous access permission of the
apps and user adoption (number of downloads and rating) was
observed.

Privacy and mobile health are interconnected because the
information is shared and accessed using different means.
Tracing apps may obtain personal information of people such
as location, phones, camera, microphone, contacts, storage,
and many others, which may lead to the breach of privacy.
Thus, security and privacy policies should be explained
clearly for all the apps in a simple language for users.
Relevantly, Amnesty International UK pointed out seven
principles at the plan of the UK Government’s decision to
roll-out a contacting-tracing app [23]. Therefore,
governments should focus on contact tracing apps that are
privacy-preserving following an acceptable guideline [23],
and that would gain the confidence of the citizens. Overriding
the consent and privacy of people for the sake of COVID-19
surveillance may raise the distrust in its population and,
ultimately, lead to poorer health outcomes in this COVID-19
pandemic.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
In this article, we have summarized 53 contact
tracing apps developed to combat COVID-19 highlighting
their ratings, user adoption, and access permissions. Some
countries declared the ordinance for the usage of contact
tracing apps as mandatory (e.g., China, Qatar), while other
countries kept it as optional. Mandatory usage of apps may
raise the eyebrow in the community considering the
surveillance and privacy issues [24]. On the other hand, optin contact tracing initiatives require a lot of motivation and
public awareness for the users. We believe our study will
provide the governments, policymakers, and apps
development industry an overall picture of the usage, ratings,
and privacy aspects of these contact tracing apps. Further
investigation on these features will enable us to develop a
secure and privacy-preserving user-friendly contact tracing
app for the containment of COVID-19. We only considered
contact tracking apps from Google Play Store. In future, we
will extend the list of contact tracing apps as well as include
apps from the Apple App Store.
