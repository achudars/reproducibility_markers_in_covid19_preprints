Abstract
The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been emerged as a rapidly spreading pandemic. The disease is thought
to spread mainly from person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or
talks. The pathogen of COVID-19 is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It infects the
cells binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) which is expressed by cells throughout the airways
as targets for cellular entry. Although the majority of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience symptoms of mild
upper respiratory tract infection, in some people infections of the peripheral airways result in severe, potentially fatal
pneumonia. However, the induction of COVID-19 pneumonia requires that SARS-CoV-2 reaches the peripheral airways.
While huge efforts have been made to understand the spread of the disease as well as the pathogenesis following cellular
entry, much less attention is paid how SARS-CoV-2 from the environment reach the receptors of the target cells. The aim
of the present study is to characterize the deposition distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the airways upon exposure to coughgenerated aerosol. For this purpose, the Stochastic Lung Deposition Model has been applied. Aerosol size distribution and
breathing parameters were taken from the literature supposing normal breathing through the nose. We found that the
probability of direct infection of the peripheral airways due to inhalation of aerosol generated by a bystander cough is very
low. As the number of pathogens deposited in the extrathoracic airways is ~10 times higher than in the peripheral airways,
we concluded that in most cases COVID-19 pneumonia must be preceded by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper airways.
Our results suggest that without the enhancement of viral load in the upper airways, COVID-19 would be much less
dangerous. The period between the onset of initial symptoms and the potential clinical deterioration could provide an
opportunity for prevention of pneumonia by blocking or significantly reducing the transport of viruses towards the
peripheral airways. Coughing into a tissue or cloth even at home in order to absorb the emitted aerosol is highly
recommended to avoid the continuous re-inhalation of own cough.

Introduction

The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) has been emerged as a rapidly spreading pandemic (1)
originating from Wuhan, China (2). There are currently few studies that define the pathophysiological
characteristics of COVID-19, and there is great uncertainty regarding its mechanism of spread (3).
However, the disease is thought to spread i) mainly from person-to-person, who are in close contact
with one another (within about 2 m) ii) through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person
coughs, sneezes or talks iii) which can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly
be inhaled into the lungs (4). Virological assessment of COVID-19 also suggests that the transmission
is droplet-, rather than fomite-, based (5).
The pathogen of COVID 19 is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
(6), which infects the cells binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) (7)
primarily in the respiratory system. Cells expressing ACE2 can be found throughout the airways (8),
and therefore, cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 can also take place throughout the airways (9). Although
the majority of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience symptoms of mild upper respiratory
tract infection, in some people infections of the peripheral airways result in severe pneumonia
potentially leading to significant hypoxia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death.
However, the induction of COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS requires that SARS-CoV-2 reaches the
lower airways.
While huge efforts have been made to understand the spread of the disease as well as the pathogenesis
following cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2, much less attention is paid how viruses from the environment
reach the receptors of the target cells in the respiratory system. The aim of the present study is to
characterize the deposition distribution of pathogens in the airways upon exposure to cough-generated
aerosol and discuss its consequences on the pathogenesis of the disease.

Methods

For this purpose, the most recent version of the Stochastic Lung Deposition Model has been applied
(10). It was originally developed by Koblinger and Hofmann (11) and continuously extended during
the last three decades (12,13). In this model, the geometry of the airways along the path of an inhaled
particle is selected randomly based on statistical analysis of large anatomical databases (14,15), while
deposition probabilities are computed by deterministic formulae considering inertial impaction,
gravitational settling and Brownian diffusion. The deposition probability in the extrathoracic airways
is determined by an empirical deposition formula (16). More details on the Stochastic Lung Deposition
Model can be found here (10–13). The deposition model was previously validated against in vivo
airway deposition measurements.
The model computes the fraction of inhaled particles that deposit in each anatomical region of the
lungs. In addition, it also yields the deposition fraction as a function of airway generation number 1.
The fraction of inhaled mass in different anatomical regions and airway generations can also be
obtained, which is particularly useful if the pathogen concentration in the coughed material is supposed

second airway generation consists of the second half of the main bronchi and the first half of their
daughters, and so on.

to be independent on the particle size. These fractions are quantified for a full breathing cycle supposing
normal breath through the nose.
Functional residual capacity of 3300 cm3, tidal volume of 750 cm3, and breathing frequency of 12 min-1
were taken from the Human Respiratory Tract Model of the International Commission on Radiological
Protection corresponding to an adult man in sitting position (17) and applicable for normal breath if
the spine is in vertical position. It was supposed that the duration of inhalation is 1.9 s followed by 0.1
s breath hold, and exhalation lasts for 2 s followed by a 1-second-long breath hold.
Besides the geometry and the flow conditions in the airways, the lung deposition of the aerosol particles
is determined by their aerodynamic properties which depends on many parameters (e.g. size, shape,
morphology, density etc.). Lindsey at al. measured the number size distributions of cough-generated
aerosol particles by means of a combined wide range aerosol particle spectrometer (optical particle
counter and scanning mobility particle sizer system), when patients with influenza cough (18).
Although it is a different disease, the virus size as well as the mechanism of aerosol generation during
dry cough is similar in case of COVID-19 and influenza, so we used these data. The mass size
distribution was obtained from the concentration, number size distribution and density of coughgenerated particles. For the calculations we assumed, that the particles are spherical and their physical
size is equal to their measured optical size. The mass size distribution is plotted in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Mass size distribution of particles emitted by coughing of patients with influenza (18). This mass size
distribution was used as input in the Monte-Carlo simulations.

The cough-generated particles may travel great distance if the meteorological conditions (air velocity,
temperature, humidity) are favorable (19). During the flight the particles may evaporate or fall down
by gravitational settling. Therefore, the present simulations apply only to one of supposed major
transmission routes, when a bystander subject (within a 1-m-distance) directly inhales the coughgenerated aerosol (4). If the inhalation takes place more distant from the source in space or time, then
the size distribution has to be measured near to the subject inhaling the emitted particles.
In a recent study, it was found that virus concentration varies highly in throat swab and sputum samples
of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with a maximum concentration exceeding 1011 RNA copies per cm3,
while the median values are in the order of 105 - 106 copies per cm3 (20). Values along this wide range
were used to obtain upper estimate for pathogen number in different lung regions and airway
generations. Other studies provided similar range for viral loads (5,21). It is important to note however
3

SARS-CoV-2 deposition in the airways
that the number of viruses capable of infection is much lower than the number of RNA copies. In a
recent study, viruses could not be isolated from samples that contained less than 106 RNA copies per
cm3 (5).
We supposed that the virus concentration is independent on the particle size. It means that the number
of pathogens is directly proportional to the mass of the particles. It is an appropriate approximation in
locations close to the source only, because evaporation increases the virus concentrations in aerosol
particles, and evaporation rate strongly depends on the particle size.

Results

As the infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes very different symptoms depending on the infected region,
first we focus on the regional deposition distribution. Figure 2 shows that while 61.8% of the inhaled
mass is filtered out by the upper airways, significant fractions deposit in the bronchial (~5.5%) and
acinar airways (~8.5%). Considering the average particle number concentration in the material coughed
(29,600 dm-3), the tidal volume (0.75 dm3), and the mean particle mass (4.6 pg), it can be calculated
that a single inhalation results in 63 ng material depositing in the extrathoracic airways, while 5.6 ng
and 8.6 ng deposit in the bronchial and acinar airways, respectively.

Figure 2. Mass deposition fraction of inhaled particles (left axis) and deposited mass from a single inhalation (right axis)
in the extrathoracic, bronchial and acinar regions of the lungs.

In a subtler subdivision of the intrathoracic airways, one can distinguish peripheral airways (all acinar
airways except the first four generations, i.e. the bronchiolus respiratorius region), small airways (with
a diameter smaller than 2 mm except the peripheral airways), and large airways (with a diameter larger
than 2 mm). Figure 3 shows the mass deposition fractions and deposited mass from a single inhalation
in these airways. While 2.7 ng and 5.7 ng material deposit in the large and small airways, respectively,
5.8 ng reach the peripheral airways, and deposit there. It may be also of interest that 2.9 ng material
deposits in the bronchiolus respiratorius region.

Figure 3. Mass deposition fraction of inhaled particles (left axis) and deposited mass from a single inhalation (right axis)
in the large, small, and peripheral airways.

The Stochastic Lung Deposition Model is able to determine the deposition fraction and deposited mass
as the function of airway generation number. Figure 4 shows that in terms of deposited mass the most
affected part of the acinar airways is the 19th and 20th airway generations, which means that most of
the pathogens penetrating the extrathoracic airways will pass 19 bifurcations before depositing. In the
bronchial region, the highest amount deposit in the 12th airway generation. The acinar peak is more
than three-fold higher than the bronchial one. However, the difference in deposition density is much
smaller as the surface of the airways strongly increases with the generation number.

Figure 4. Mass deposition fraction of inhaled particles (left axis) and deposited mass from a single inhalation (right axis)
as the function of airway generation number.

In order to estimate the amount of deposited pathogens in different parts of the airways, viral RNA
concentrations measured by Pan et al. (20) was used. They found that the viral loads ranged from 641
RNA copy per cm3 to 1.34 × 1011 RNA copy per cm3 with a median of 7.99 × 104 and 7.52 × 105 RNA
copy per cm3 in throat swab and sputum samples, respectively. In order to obtain an upper estimate for
the pathogen concentration in the material emitted by dry coughing, the concentrations in the throat
have to be taken into account. Therefore, the former of the median values is considered. Using the
5

SARS-CoV-2 deposition in the airways
density from Lindsey et al. (18), these data can be converted to virus concentrations in unit mass
resulting in viral loads ranging from 376 RNA copy per g to 7.86 × 1010 RNA copy per g with a median
of 4.69 × 104 RNA copy per g in throat swab samples.
Combining the median value in sputum samples with the regional deposition distribution data, it can
be found that about 4000 breathing cycles are required to result in one deposited copy of RNA in the
peripheral airways accompanied by 12 copy depositing in the extrathoracic, and one RNA depositing
in the bronchial airways. Taking into account the maximal measured concentration of 1.34 × 1011 RNA
copy per cm3, it can be obtained that from a single inhalation 4900 copy of RNA deposit in the
extrathoracic airways, and 460 copy of RNA deposit in the peripheral airways. Considering that the
concentration of viruses capable of infection is about one millionth of the RNA copy concentration (5),
the probability of direct infection of the peripheral airways from inhalation of cough-generated aerosol
is very low.

Discussion

It seems to be surprising that inhalation of aerosol generated by coughing of someone with viral loads
of 4.69 × 104 RNA copy per g results in negligible amount of RNA copies, around 2.5 × 10-4 in the
peripheral airways of a bystander person. The reason for this fact is that the mass of inhaled material
is low, and therefore the absolute number of pathogens is also low. Figure 5 shows the average number
of RNA copies per aerosol particle as well as the probability that a particle contains at least one RNA
copy of the virus as the function of particle size.
We assumed homogenous virus distribution in the initial throat swab sample, and that the number of
viruses in a particle is proportional to its mass. The probability that a particle contains at least one RNA
copy of the virus was calculated assuming Poisson distribution. The graph clearly shows that the
probability that a particle contains a virus is relatively low in the submicrometer size range, even at
very high virus concentrations in the throat.

contains at least one virus copy (solid lines) as the function of particle size in case of different initial virus concentrations

SARS-CoV-2 deposition in the airways
Independently on the virus concentration in the inhaled air, it can be concluded that about 10 times
more pathogens deposit in the extrathoracic airways than in the peripheral airways. It is in agreement
with the clinical observation that the typical first respiratory symptom of COVID-19 is dry cough
(22,23), which is often caused by upper respiratory infections. In addition, anosmia and ageusia have
also been reported suggesting infection of cells in the upper airways (5,24,25).
It was also found here that material emitted by coughing directly reaches the peripheral airways.
Therefore, inhalation of air after a bystander cough can theoretically induce pneumonia without the
need for preceding upper respiratory symptoms. Based on the present study, however, such direct
induction of COVID-19 pneumonia requires either very large virus concentrations in the aerosol
particles or very long exposures to coughing. The latter underlines that even at home it is very important
to cough into a tissue or cloth in order to absorb the emitted aerosol, and avoid the re-inhalation of own
cough. Reducing the re-inhalation could then significantly prolong, or even block the onset of further,
more severe phases of the COVID-19 disease.
The results suggest that inhalation of cough-generated aerosol containing SARS-CoV-2 results in only
an upper airway infection directly, which can later develop into pneumonia. It is in agreement with the
clinical observation that some patients who have mild symptoms initially will subsequently have
precipitous clinical deterioration that occurs approximately one week after symptom onset (22,23,26).
It is also in agreement with a recent virological analysis of nine mild cases of COVID-19 providing
proof of active replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in tissues of the upper respiratory tract (5). They
found very high concentration of viral RNA in and isolated the virus itself from early throat swabs.
Our results suggest that without the enhancement of virus concentrations in the upper airways SARSCoV-2 would be much less dangerous. In another study, nasal epithelial cells were found to show the
highest expression of ACE2 among all investigated cell types in the respiratory system (9), which
together with the deposition fraction synergistically increase the probability of upper respiratory
infections.
From the throat where high virus concentration can be found in patients with mild symptoms (5),
pathogens can be transported either via the cardiovascular or the respiratory system. As SARS-CoV-2
genome could not be detected in the blood of patients with mild symptoms (27), transport via the
respiratory system can be the dominant route. Potential mechanisms of virus transport from the throat
to the lower airways may include re-inhalation of own cough, aerosol generation in the throat during
inhalation by resuspension, pathogen transport on the surface of the bronchial airways, or gradual
infection of neighboring cells expressing ACE2 towards the periphery. Mucociliary clearance can
inhibit the latter two processes suggesting that compromised mucus production or transport can be a
risk factor for COVID-19 pneumonia. Understanding the processes leading from infections of the upper
airways to pneumonia in COVID-19 patients may help to identify early treatment and prevention
strategies, and provide further insights on the long incubation period.

Conclusions

In order to quantify the deposition distribution of cough-generated aerosol containing SARS-CoV-2
viruses, we applied the Stochastic Lung Deposition Model. It was found here that the probability of
direct infection of the peripheral airways due to inhalation of aerosol by a bystander cough is very low.
As the number of pathogens deposited in the extrathoracic airways is 10 times higher than in the
peripheral airways, we concluded that in most cases COVID-19 pneumonia must be preceded by
SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper airways. The one week difference observed in several patients
between the onset of their initial mild symptoms and precipitous clinical deterioration (22,23,26)
provides a precious window for prevention of pneumonia and ARDS by blocking or significantly

reducing the transport of the virus towards the peripheral airways. Therefore, coughing into a tissue or
cloth even at home in order to absorb the emitted aerosol is highly recommended to avoid the
continuous re-inhalation of own cough. Further research is required to understand the processes leading
from infections of the upper airways to pneumonia in COVID-19 patients.
