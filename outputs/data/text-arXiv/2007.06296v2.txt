Among the many aspects that characterize the COVID-19 pandemic, two seem particularly challenging to understand: i) the great geographical differences in the degree of virus contagiousness and
lethality which were found in the different phases of the epidemic progression, and, ii) the potential
role of the infected people’s blood type in both the virus infectivity and the progression of the disease.
A recent hypothesis could shed some light on both aspects. Specifically, it has been proposed that
in the subject-to-subject transfer SARS-CoV-2 conserves on its capsid the erythrocytes’ antigens
of the source subject. Thus these conserved antigens can potentially cause an immune reaction in
a receiving subject that has previously acquired specific antibodies for the source subject antigens.
This hypothesis implies a blood type-dependent infection rate. The strong geographical dependence
of the blood type distribution could be, therefore, one of the factors at the origin of the observed
heterogeneity in the epidemics spread. Here, we present an epidemiological deterministic model
where the infection rules based on blood types are taken into account and compare our model outcomes with the exiting worldwide infection progression data. We found an overall good agreement,
which strengthens the hypothesis that blood types do play a role in the COVID-19 infection.

Introduction

The new infectious coronavirus disease 2019, called
COVID-19, began to spread from China in December
2019 [1]. The most evident COVID-19 symptoms are
pneumonia and respiratory failure, which reiterate the
symptoms reported in the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic of 2003 [2, 3]. The first cluster to clearly show these symptoms were patients from
Wuhan, People’s Republic of China (WMHC) [2]. In
early January 2020, scientists at the National Institute
of Viral Disease Control and Prevention (IVDC) isolated
the new virus for the first time from patients in Wuhan
and found it to be a novel β-genus coronavirus, which has
been named SARS-CoV-2 [4]. Currently, the outbreak
has rapidly spread in many other countries. Hence, on
11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared
it a pandemic [5, 6].
Understanding the transmission dynamics of this infection plays a key role in assessing the diffusion potential
that may be sustained in the future. In this context,
models and simulations represent a powerful tool, which
can be useful to study and monitor human and animal
viral infections [7, 8]. These tools have become fundamental, especially during this pandemic, to evaluate the
trade-off between cost and effectiveness of various social
distancing strategies, and to enable policymakers to make
the best decisions in the interest of the public health [9].
Nonetheless, each disease is characterized by its specific
biological rules, therefore it is essential to consider them
in a mathematical model to describe real situations. As
the virus spreads across the world the pandemic has presented a similar pattern, in all the countries that recorded
a significant number of infections. The pattern is made

up of a first phase that is characterized by an exponential increase of infections and a later phase in which the
implementation of social distancing measures reduces the
spread of the disease to a sub-exponential growth, which
generally is followed by a gradual decrease of daily infections. Eventually, the gradual decrease in the number
of daily infections becomes smaller than the daily recovered number, thus the number of the total infected starts
decreasing. Even if this general pattern has been reproduced around the world, the spread of the virus showed
important local differences, mostly in the rate of the initial exponential spread. Given the complex nature of
this historic event, it is extremely difficult to understand
if these patterns are the consequence of geographical inhomogeneities or if these are spurious correlations which
are caused by the singularity of the observed event. Indeed, some works underlined as in the early stage of the
epidemics the virus showed a geographical pattern with
most of the infection localized in temperate regions characterized by specific characteristics of temperature and
humidity [10–13]. Furthermore, in the specific context of
Italy, a non-negligible difference in the rate of infection
and mortality between the Northern and Southern regions was reported. But most analyses considered these
differences as the effect of the implementation of social
distancing rules before that the disease spread in South
Italy and not of climate variables [14]. Other potential
co-morbidities that may explain local patterns are hypertension, obesity, and age distribution, which are known to
display heterogeneous local distributions [15, 16]. Also,
the local history of past infections of different coronaviruses could contribute to the observed heterogeneity,
due to cross-reactivity immunity effects [17, 18].
In particular, blood groups were recognized to influence susceptibility to certain viruses, including SARSCoV-1 [19] and norovirus [20]. Blood group A and B
glycosyltransferases also affect glycosylation in a large
number of cell types, including epithelial cells in the res-

piratory tract and shed viral particles [21].
Recently, Zhao et al. [22] found that ABO blood groups
presented a different risk to contract COVID-19 as a
result of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Previously,
for the similar coronavirus SARS-CoV responsible for
SARS, Guillon et al. [23] showed experimentally that
for SARS-CoV synthesized by cells that expressed the
A histo-blood group antigen, the interaction between
S protein and its membrane receptor, ACE2, could be
blocked by anti-A blood group antibodies. Starting
from these experimental results regarding the SARS-CoV
spike, Breiman et al. [24] extended the hypothesis to the
new SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the different susceptibility of individuals with different ABO blood groups
may have the same explanation. This new hypothesis,
based on the infection rules schematically illustrated in
Figure 1, may explain a part of the variability in the infection contagiousness among the countries of the world
[24].
Here, we discuss the spread of the epidemic from a
mathematical modeling perspective, taking into account
the influence of the different sub-populations divided according to blood types, in the different geographical areas. The main purpose of this work is to verify whether
the hypothesized blood group based infection rules can be
consistent with the acquired country-level data on blood
group distribution and infection diffusion dynamics. In
the last decades, the modeling of epidemic diffusion behaviors has rapidly developed and found wide application [25]. Many recent papers described different aspects
of the COVID-19 disease evolution through mathematical models [26–33]. We propose here a generalization
of the widely-used Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model
(SIR), a simple compartmental model, where the population is divided into three sets. “Susceptible” are healthy
individuals who can be infected by other individuals. “Infected” individuals are those who contracted the virus at
time t, while “Recovered” consists of all the immune individuals, therefore they cannot be infected again. Each
of these compartments is time-dependent, owing to the
progressive nature of the disease. Since the SIR model is
a deterministic system, we can model the epidemic process using ordinary differential equations. Consequently,
the evolution in time of each compartment state is completely determined by the initial conditions along with
the differential equations [34]. Here, we modified the
SIR model to take into account the proposed blood type
infection rules to test the working hypothesis against real
data.

FIG. 1: Scheme of the possible infection rules according to Rh
blood types and ABO ones. Full line connection indicated the
possibility of infection, Wij = 1, while dotted connection its
impossibility. In the Rh infection system, individuals of the
same group can infect each other, people with the Rh- group
can transmit the infection to people with Rh+ one, but not
viceversa. The scenario of the ABO system is similar although
richer. For instance, 0 type can infect the A type, while the
opposite is not possible.

We then analyze in detail the generalization of the SIR
model to a more complex pattern of infection, as the one
described in the previous section. A more complete discussion about the mathematical details of this treatment
can be found in Supporting Information.

Standard SIR model

The standard SIR model reads
dx(t)

dy(t)
dt
dz(t)
dt

= −β x(t) y(t)

(1)

= β x(t) y(t) − γ y(t)

(2)

= γ y(t)

(3)

where the three functions satisfy the relation
x(t) + y(t) + z(t) = 1

(4)

and the parameter β and γ represent the infection and
recovery rate respectively.
.
We introduce the parameter ρ = γ/β and the re-scaled
.
time τ = βt. We thus chose the simple and realistic
case of a few infected persons at time zero, and all the
remaining population susceptible of infection:

Model

In this section we first briefly consider the standard
SIR model for the time evolution of the fraction of susceptible (x(t)), infected (y(t)), and recovered (z(t)) people in a population of size N , recalling the main features
of the model and its solution [35].

x(0) = xo
y(0) = yo = 1 − xo
z(0) = 0.

(5)

The solution of the standard SIR model that obey
these initial conditions can be written as:

3

x(τ ) = xo e−z(τ )/ρ

(8)

Further details on the derivation of this solution are
reported in the Supporting Information.
Short time expansion

It is well know that the initial stage of the infection is
well represented by an exponential growth. It is therefore
useful to perform the expansion of the solutions (6), (7)
and (8) for τ → 0.
In the small τ limit, the expression for τ (z) given by
Eq. (8), becomes:

τ (z) ≈ τ |z=0 +

dτ
dz

z=
z=0

(i.e. if a single infected individual generates on average
more than one secondary infection), an infective agent
can cause an outbreak. If R0 < 1 (i.e. if a single infected
individual generates less than one secondary infection),
then (1 − ρ) < 0 and the initial stage of the epidemy is
characterized by a decreasing number of cases.

Summary of standard SIR properties

In this subsection, we recollect the main results from
previous Sections and those in the Supporting Information. The main results are four. First, it is worth to
always perform the limit xo → 1, while keeping yo 6= 0 as
discussed below. This allows us to correctly capture the
exponential growth that characterizes the initial phase of
an epidemic.
Second,the exact solutions of the standard SIR model
wit the initial conditions (5) are:
x(τ ) = e−z(τ )/ρ
y(τ ) = 1 − z(τ ) − ez(τ )/ρ .
Z z(τ )
1
dζ
τ =
ρ 0
1 − ζ − e−ζ/ρ

thus

Third, the value of maximum infection is found to be:
z(τ ) ≈ ρ(1 − xo )τ = ρyo τ.

(9)

yM = 1 − ρ + ρ log(ρ).

By substituting in (6) and (7), we get
x(τ ) ≈ xo e−yo τ
y(τ ) ≈ 1 − ρyo τ − xo e−yo τ .

(10)
(11)

Fourth, at short time, when the exponential growth
dominate the solution, the following approximations
hold:
x(τ ) = e−yo τ

The last equation, by expanding the exponential, collecting the terms linear in τ and resuming the exponential, becomes:

y(τ ) = yo e(1−ρ)τ

y(τ ) ≈ yo e(xo −ρ)τ

which represents the desired exponential growth of the
infection at short time. As at short time the fraction of
infected population is very small (i.e. yo  1), we can
safely approximate xo ≈ 1:

As last observation, it is worth to emphasize that
Eq. (14) is identical to the short time expansion of the
infectivity in the SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible)
model, which is a simplified version of the SIR model
where individuals never acquire immunity to the infection. The latter, at short time, reads:

y(τ ) ≈ yo e(1−ρ)τ .

ẏ(τ ) = xo y(τ ) − ρy(τ )

(12)

(13)

Equation (13) expresses one of the key concepts of
epidemic models. The number of infectious individuals
grows exponentially if ρ < 1, or β > γ. Often, in the
literature, the parameter controlling the level of infection growth is the “reproduction number”, Ro , defined
as the average number of secondary infections caused by
a primary case introduced in a fully susceptible population [36]. Ro is therefore equal to β/γ, which, in our
notation, means Ro = 1/ρ.
From those simple considerations arises the concept of
epidemic threshold: only if (1 − ρ) > 0, thus R0 > 1

(14)

z(τ ) = ρyo τ

(15)

whose solution coincides with Eq. (12)) or, after the
xo = 1 approximation, with Eq. (13)).
Generalized SIR model

In this section, we present a general SIR model, which
describes the evolution of the epidemic assuming that
transmission of the infection depends on the blood groups
of the individuals. In particular, we will show how to derive proper descriptors that take into consideration not

where the matrix W encodes the infection rules.
As fisrt example, we discuss the simple case of only
two sub-populations that could follow the infection rules
associated to the Rh± blood type (f1 ≡ f− , f2 ≡ f+ ,
where f± is the frequency of one blood type in the population). We assume the the sub-population with Rh+
cannot infect the Rh− one. On the other hand, the
Rh− sub-population can infect both Rh− and Rh+ subpopulations. The matrix W(2) in this situation turns out
to be:

W =

The corresponding SIR equations, to our knowledge,
cannot be solved by quadrature. This example is discussed in some details in Supporting Information, where
it is also reported the short time expansion. The numerical solution for this k = 2 case is also depicted in Figure 2,
where as an example the fraction of infected people yi (τ )
for the two sub-populations (green dashed and red dotted lines) and the total fraction yT (τ ) of infected people
(blue line) are reported as a function of the reduced time
τ for the case ρ = 0.1 and f1 = 0.4, f2 = 0.6.
One can immediately notice that the maximum fraction of infected people, yM , is reduced with respect
to the one-population case (horizontal dash-dotted blue
line). This is a trivial consequence of the impossibility
of ‘+’ to infect ‘-’, thus reducing the “effective” infection rate. The dependence of the maximum infectivity
on f1 (f2 = 1 − f1 ) is reported in the inset of Figure 2
for three representative values of ρ (ρ=0.1, 0.3 and 0.5).

only transmission rules based on the AB0 group but also
possible combinations of different groups. As examples,
we discuss the hypothetical cases of a two-group set of
rules (i.e. the Rhesus group), the ABO group, and their
combination. We note that from a biological point of
view, it seems improbable that the Rh system could play
a role in the infection transmission however the derived
framework could be applied to other kinds of glycanbased groups, like the Lewis one.
As we said, our aim is to generalize the SIR model to
the case where the population is not homogeneous, but
it is composed of different sub-populations that follow
specific infection rules.
In the general case of k sub-populations i = 1, ..., k ,
the time evolution of the variables can be written as:

FIG. 2: Example of numerical solution of the generalised SIR
model for two sub-populations (k = 2) and for the infectivity
matrix of Eq. (19). The reported example is for ρ = 0.1,
f1 = 0.4 and f2 = 0.6. The dashed and red lines represent
the fraction of infected people in the two sub-populations, the
blue line the total fraction of infected persons, the horizontal
dotted line indicates the maximum value, yM , of yT (τ ) in the
case of all-infect-all rule. The inset report the maximum of
yT (τ ) as a function of f1 (f2 = 1−f1 ) for three distinct values
of ρ.

is reduced from the all-infect-all case (≈0.2) to a value
more than ten times smaller (≈0.01) when f1 approach
0.5. The immediate consequence of this finding is that
the time evolution of the epidemic strongly depends on
the blood type distribution, giving a qualitative explanation of the observed high geographical variability: even a
small change in f1 /f2 highly affects both the infectivity
maximum and the infectivity growth rate in the initial
exponential growth phase.
If we turn to consider the more biologically relevant
case of the ABO types, we have four subpopulations with
the corresponding frequencies: f1 ≡ f0 , f2 ≡ fA , f3 ≡
fB , f4 ≡ fAB ). With the infection rules summarised in
Figure 1 the W(4) matrix results:


W(2)
0
W(4) =
(20)
W(2) W(2)
Finally, assuming that both the ABO and the Rh types
would play a role, there are eight subpopulations with
respective frequencies fO− ≡ f1 , fA− ≡ f2 , fB− ≡ f3 ,
fAB− ≡ f4 , fO+ ≡ f5 , fA+ ≡ f6 , fB+ ≡ f7 , fAB+ ≡ f8 ,
and the corresponding matrix W(8) reads:


W(4)
0
(8)
W =
(21)
W(4) W(4)
The recursive structure of Eqs. (19 - 21) has a simple explanation, that can be better understood if we
think of the ABO blood type system as the combination of two codominant and one recessive allele that form
two independent systems. Let’s specify if a person does
have (“+”) or does not have (“−”) the antigen A (A+

5
or A− respectively), analogously for the antigen B (B+
or B−). Then the usual blood type is: 0 ≡ [A−,B−];
A ≡ [A+,B−]; B ≡ [A−,B+]; AB ≡ [A+,B+]. With
this notation it is clear that the “ABO” system (which
follows W (4) ) is the product of the “A” system (which
follows W (2) ) and the “B” system (which again follows
W (2) ): ABO=A± × B±. Furthermore, by multiplying
the ABO system by the Rh± system we get the ABO
× Rh± = A± × B± × Rh± system, which obeys the
W (8) infection rules. Summing up, any time it exists a
set of antigens, Ai , i = 1..a, that can be either present
or absent, the infection rule of the A1 × A2 ×.... × Aa
system follows the W (k) infection rule with k = 2a .
The set of 3k differential equations (16 - 18), together
with the initial conditions:
xi (0) = fi xo ≈ fi
yi (0) = fi yo
zi (0) = 0

(22)

and the sum rule

allows one to work out the short time expansion for the
infected person fraction on each of the k sub-populations:
(k)

yi (τ ) = yo fi eπi

τ

i = 1, ..., k

(24)

To study the global effect of the population composition on the progression of the infection, we concentrate
(k)
on the term pT which acts as a “susceptibility”.
It is worth to note that, for any k, the susceptibil(k)
ity is maximum when f¯ = (0...0, 1, 0, ...0), pT = 1,
i.e. when one sub-population fraction dominates, while it
minimum when the sub-populations are all of the same
size: f¯ = (1/k, 1/k...1/k). In the latter case, for the
(k)
infection rules reported before, pT = (3/4)(k/2) . Thus
the susceptibility decreases on increasing the number of
sub-populations and decreases on equalizing their abundances. Infection rules and compositions of the population are expected to shape the infection dynamics along
with the usual infection and recovering rates.
In the following we will analyze available datasets of
individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2, stratified by blood
types. Then, we will deal with the contagion curves of
a large set of countries and try to assess whether the
present model could represent the real outcome of the
COVID-19 pandemics. Specifically, we will first compare
data collected in the Chinese regions of Wuhan and Shenzhen reported in [22], in Denmark [37], in the Ankara
region (Turkey) [38], in New York City (NY, USA) [39],
in Italy and Spain [40] and USA [41]. This allows for
a direct comparison between our model predictions and
real data. Then we move to analyze the early stages of
the infection in different countries at a worldwide level.
To take into account differences like lifestyle, climate, geographic location, and other factors that likely influence
the epidemics rates as well, we identified four major areas, i.e. Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America.

To test the hypothesis that blood groups could impact the COVID-19 infection spread, we collected data
from clinical observations of individuals found positive
for SARS-CoV-2 for which also ABO blood group information was available. In Table I, the ABO frequencies
of positive patients (di ) and those of control populations
(fi ) are reported. The first four sets of data were collected in three Wuhan hospitals and one Shenzhen hospital [22, 42]. The number of patients in the three subcases are 1775, 113,265, and 285, respectively. Notably,
the abundance of each ABO blood group on the local
population is reported as controls, allowing us to study
the impact of local ABO phenotypic heterogeneities. Differences between infected and control frequencies were
found with a higher level of statistical significance in A
and O groups.
A recent work by Barnkob et al. [37] retrieved ABO
group information for 7422 Danish individuals found positive to SARS-CoV-2 between 27 February 2020 and 30

July 2020. The reference ABO frequencies, fi were instead obtained from about 2 million Danish people. In
this case, statistical confidence is found for O,A, and AB
groups (p-value < 0.05), while B group is associated to a
p-value of 0.091 (see [37]).
Further data stratified by ABO blood groups are reported in [38] for 186 patients with a confirmed diagnosis
of COVID-19 in the region of Ankara. The fraction of
infected, di for each ABO blood group are reported in
Table I, together with the frequencies of the groups in
a control sample of 1881 hospitalized individuals, whose
blood groups were collected in the same period of time
of the 186 infected cases. The reduced size of the sample
assures statistical confidence only for A and O groups
(p-value < 0.05), with AB being the less trust-wort with
a p-value of 0.364 (see [38]).
Another work by Zietz et al. [39], collected information
of ABO groups for 682 infected individuals tested in New
York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical
Center (NYP/CUIMC).
Finally, additional data was collected by two works
that considered critically ill patients in Italy and
Spain [40] and in the United States [41]. Comparing
blood frequencies of infected and control populations,

a sub-representation of blood group O and an overrepresentation of group A was registered in both Italian
and Spanish datasets, in accordance with the observations in Wuhan/Shenzhen and Denmark. Data collected
by Leaf et al. [41] are stratified by both ABO blood
groups and ethnicity.
Data Analysis

Once we have collected the availaible data on the number of infected people stratified by blood type, di , in a
geographical area where the blood type distribution, fi ,
is known we perform the comparison of these data with
the model. According to Eqs. (24) and (27) we expect
that
(k)

di = yo fi e(pi

−ρ)τ ∗

i = 1..k

(29)

(k)

with pi = (W · f¯)i and τ ∗ the specific (reduced) time
when the data have been collected. Therefore
(k)

ln(di /fi ) = K + pi τ ∗

i = 1..k
∗

(30)

being K a constant (K = ln yo − ρτ ) not depending on
i. We thus expect a linear relation between ln(di /fi ) and

7
(k)

pi . The error bars on ln(di /fi ) are one standard deviation calculated by assuming a Poissonian distribution for
√
the number of cases, thus ∆(ln(di /fi )) = 1/ ni being
ni the number of infected persons with blood type i.

Cases where infection data are not stratified by
blood type

To our knowledge, all the studies reporting the blood
type stratification of the infection data are reported in
Table I. To further test the blood type constrained in(k)
fection rules proposed in [24], we have to abandon pi
k
(the susceptibility per group) and focus on pT (the total susceptibility), for which a large amount of data is
available.

The countries case

The incidence of the different blood types in different
nations can be found in Wikipedia [43], where a collection
of data and the original sources references are reported.
These frequencies f are also listed in Table II, together
with the country ISO code. From these data we can
(2)
calculate pT (keeping into account the Rh± type) and
(4)
pT (keeping into account only the ABO type) according
to Eq. (27) for each country. To estimate the uncertainty
(k)
on pT , we observe that the f are reported with three
significant digits. We therefore associate to each f (which
value is of the order of one) an error equal to ∆f = 10−3 ,
(k)
and we estimate the upper limit of the error on pT ,
√
(k)
which is bi-linear in f , as ∆pT ≈ 2 k∆f .
The data of the contagion by country is taken from
World Health Organization (WHO) Coronavirus Disease
(COVID-19) Dashboard on date 12th of June 2020 [44].
To ensure statistical reliability, we selected only countries
that had registered at least 2000 positive cases from the
start of the epidemic. Requiring also to know the frequencies of both ABO and Rh±, we ended up with 78
countries, whose information is reported in Table II.
In particular, the WHO data reports the number of
new infections per day, Ḋ(t). From this quantity, we
easily obtain the cumulative number of peopleR that have
t
been infected as a function of time, D(t) = o Ḋ(t0 )dt0 .
The cumulative, rather than directly with Ḋ(t) allows
us to work on cleaner and more solid data because the
day-by-day fluctuations are averaged out in the long run.
Coming back to the model, at short times the cumulative
DT (τ ) is directly related to yT (τ ), which short-time expansion is reported in Eq. (26). Overall, the COVID19
infection is characterized by low mortality but a high
infectivity rate together with both long incubation and
recovery periods. These conditions assure that limiting
our analysis to the early stages of the infection, the cumulative can be regarded as a good proxy for the number

of infected.
For each country reported in Table II, we manually selected the time interval corresponding to the initial stage
of the infection. In that range, we performed an unsupervised fit using the function:
(
m0 t
if
t < t0

Y (t) =
(31)
m(t−t0 )
m 0 t0 + A e
− 1 if
t > t0
with to , mo , m and A as free parameters. In this expression, A is a scaling factor and m represents the inverse of the characteristic time of the infection exponential growth, which is the quantity that we are looking
at. The linear term, observed at the very beginning of
the infection curve of different (not all) countries, can be
rationalized by assuming that at the very early stage of
the infection, people arrive from other countries, spreading the virus before the real exponential growth appears.
The constant m0 is the “arrival rate” of infected people
(which is reasonable to assume constant in time), and we
do not expect any correlation between m and m0 , because m is an intrinsic characteristic of the population,
and m0 only depend on the arrival from abroad. Besides
the specific meaning of the different parameters, our aim
is to derive the value of m, to compare this value with
(k)
the prediction of the model πT .
In Table II, we report the values of m with its statistical error ∆m as derived from the fit. Examples of the
fits are reported in the Supporting Information. In this
section, we compare the outcome of the model with the
available observational data (presented in the previous
section). Here model indicates the combination of the
generalized SIR and the infection rules hypothesized in
[24].
Results
Cases where infection data are stratified by blood
type

At first, we considered the Wuhan/Shenzhen data. In
the papers by Zhao et al. [22] and Li et al. [42] data
of the COVID-19 contagion are reported, stratified by
ABO blood type (no info on the Rh± type are given). In
particular, for each of the four investigated hospitals, the
authors provide the frequencies of the ABO blood types
of the local population, f¯ = (f0 , fA , fB , fAB ) (three of
them are the same as the hospitals are in the same city).
The authors also report the fraction of cases for each
blood ABO type: d¯ = (d0 , dA , dB , dAB ). These values
are summarised in table I.
As discussed before, the model predicts a linear rela(4)
tion between ln(di /fi ) and pi . In Fig. (3a) we report a
plot of these two quantities. The different colors represent the different datasets. The black line is the result of
the least square fitting to all the data. Finally, the light
grey indicates the ± one standard deviation area.

The Pearson correlation coefficient for the N=16 data
points is 0.82. The corresponding p-value (10−4 ) gives us
confidence that the model is compatible with the observations.
Further data, with higher statistics, was collected
by [37], based on Danish individuals found positive to
COVID-19 (see Table I). Figure 3b shows once again the
logarithm of the ratio between frequencies of infected
people for each ABO group, di over frequency of the
group on the healthy population, fi against the expected
(4)
susceptibility, pi . Even in this case, a correlated trend is
appreciable. The Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.85
when considering all four blood groups (N=4, p-value
0.15). If we do not consider B group data, the only one
that is not statistically significant (see [37]), the correlation increases to 0.99 (N=3, p-value 0.08). Combining
the Wuhan/Shenzen datasets with the Denmark one, we
obtained an overall correlation of 0.78 (N=20, p-value
< 10−4 ).
To our knowledge, the five datasets, considered so far,
are the only available ones for which (i) not only severely
ill patients were considered and (ii) the control population was not composed of hospital patients. This allows
us to test the contribution of the blood type to the sole
infection transmission.

Next, we took into consideration all datasets in Table I.
In Figure 4, the logarithm of the ratio between the
number of infected for each group over the group frequency of the local population (ln(di /fi )) is compared
(4)
with the 4-group susceptibility, pi computed according
to Eq. 25 and using the data in Table I. We observe a linear correlation of 0.53 with a p-value smaller than 10−4 .

The quantities πT represent the inverse of the characteristic time of the infection (of the whole population)
at its initial exponential stage. Therefore, they can be
directly compared with the quantities m previously discussed. Since the slopes m are measured plotting the

data as a function of the real-time t, while πT are proportional to the scaled time τ = βt, we expect the rela(k)

tion m = βπT = βpT − γ. Therefore, from a plot of m

extract the parameters β and γ.

in Table I. Black line represents the best solution of a linear fit.

At first, we compared the m found for the 29 coun(k)
tries of the European area with the corresponding pT s
computed starting from the frequencies of the different blood types found in each country and reported in
Table II. While a contagion scheme based only on the
(2)
Rhesus group rules (pT ) does not explain the observed
trends of the epidemics, a high Pearson correlation (0.71)
is present between data and model predictions when con(4)
tagions are driven by the ABO group rules (pT ). Indeed,
as shown in Figure 5a, countries with higher susceptibility also present, on average, a higher m value. A linear
fit of the data allows us to extract the overall values of infection (β) and recovery (γ) rates that if combined yield
a value of R0 of ∼ 2 in excellent agreement with the
current estimates of reproduction number in the early

stages of the outbreak [45]. We note that points tend
to form two clusters. Interestingly, retrieving the geographic information, we see a clear east-to-west gradient
of the susceptibility, which drives back to the different
geographical distribution of the ABH phenotypes [46].
Figure 5b clearly shows at a glance this trend for the
(4)
four-group susceptibility, pT .
To test the obtained linear trends, we performed an
F-test assuming a constant slope as null-hypothesis. In
Table III, p-values for both the Pearson coefficient and
(2)
F-statistic are reported. Note that the significance of pT
is just an artifact of the data disposition, which tend to
(2)
cluster around the values of pT = 0.87, thus yielding a
high slope. Reversing the axis and repeating the linear
fit, one obtains a value of F of 1.28 which has a p-value

increase of the 0 blood type in this direction: the more one blood type dominates, the higher is the susceptibility.

above the threshold.

South America and Africa

Asia

Repeating the same analyses carried out for European
countries with those in the Asia region, we found an over(4)
all similar trend (see Figure 6). In particular, pT values
present a non-random linear correlation with the inverse
characteristic times, m, of 0.45. The corresponding pvalues are below the threshold of 0.05 for the 21 Asiatic
countries.
Testing the linear fits with the F-test, we can reject
the null hypothesis for all three cases, with the usual
threshold level of 0.05. All results are again summarized
in Table III.

Finally, we consider two other distinct regions, i.e.
South America and Africa, both characterized by a still
exponentially proliferating infection. The former exhibits
a trend similar to the Europe one, characterized by an unsubstantial contribution of the Rhesus group rules, while
a correlation of 0.62 is present between the m coming
(4)
from the fitting of the infection curves and pT . The infection and recovering rates obtained by a linear fit are
both smaller than those found in the Eurasian region.
However, they combine to give a value of R0 of ∼ 2.
Both the p-value of the Pearson correlation and that an
F-test on the linear fit are below the significance thresh(2)
old of 0.05 for all set of rules except for pT one. Results
for the African region instead show no meaningful correlation. As it is the slope of the best linear fit which does
not pass an F-test with zero slope as a null hypothesis.

Final comments on the countries cases

Overall, we found a statistically significant correlation
(4)
among the m and pT data for Europe, Asia, and South
Americas, taken individually. The reason for analyzing
separately these continents lies in the fact that we expect
that beside blood type distribution other factors affect
the infectivity onset and initial growth rate. The lifestyle
and the local climate are certainly some of them. We have
therefore considered countries aggregations that preserve
at the best these two aspects. To check this hypothesis, we have analyzed (see Table IV) what is the effect
of adding North America and/or Australia to the European countries. As can be seen in Table IV, the Pearson
correlation does not change significantly in these cases.

and Europe together, although the Pearson correlation
still maintains a high degree of statistical significance (pvalue better than 10−4 ). The correlation becomes even
worst when considering the whole world (Pearson 0.43)
but also in this case there is a great advantage (p-value
better than 10−3 ) with respect to the null hypothesis
(k)
(no-correlation between m and pT ). We conclude that
the model presented here is compatible with the existing
data.
As far as the effect of temperature, humidity, etc. it is
tempting to speculate on the obtained results: i) Europe
and Asia share a good correlation, as well as the values of
β and γ; ii) South America has again a good correlation,
but its β and γ are smaller than in Europe and Asia;
iii) Africa shows a bad correlation. These three points
could be rationalized remembering that, at the pandemic
initial stage Europe and Asia were in their wintertime,
South America in the summertime, while African countries experienced different climate situations.

DISCUSSION

Most of the proteins that decorate cell membranes are
bound to glycans [47]. The presence of those carbohydrate chains provides a further channel of interaction between proteins, besides the usual direct protein-protein
one, and evolved to play a large array of life-sustaining
functions including support, signaling, protein folding,
and protection.

13
It has been suggested that protection against
pathogens was the driving force that favored the evolution of the complex landscape of glycan interactions (see
e.g. [48] for a more detailed discussion). Since viruses do
not have genes for glycan synthesis or modification, they
inherit host cell glycans after each round of replication
in a new host. This means that the host cell in which
the virus last replicated generated the glycans on viral
glycoproteins [48].
A mutation in the host population having as an outcome the loss of a glycan modification could then provide
a selective advantage to the glycan-lacking subpopulation. In fact, pathogens using that glycan as a receptor
would not be able to invade the host cells anymore. Moreover, the host can develop specific antibodies against the
abolished glycan [49]. Human blood groups constitute
an important example. Individuals having O blood group
lack A or B antigens and when presented with glycan motifs similar to either A or B antigens, they develop anti-A
and anti-B antibodies. Individuals with A or B blood
group develop either anti-B or anti-A antibodies, respectively. On the other hand, people with subgroup AB are
not able to develop such antibodies. According to those
‘rules’, in case of an infection, one would expect that
looking at the blood type of the people found infected
by the virus, group O should be under-represented with
respect to its occurrence in the whole population. This
feature has been indeed observed by Zhao and coworkers [22] for the COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the novel
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Notably, a similar behavior
was found in the hospital outbreak of SARS in Hong
Kong in 2003 [50] and in that of the West Nile virus
in Greece in 2010 [51]. Moreover, both SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 S protein trimers are covered by an extensive glycan shield, surrounding the receptor-binding domain and can infect cells that express ABH antigens as
a consequence of the individual phenotype [52, 53]. Importantly, these hypothesized asymmetrical transmission
rules should affect the number of people with a certain
blood type that can be potentially be infected because
they do not allow all infected to infect any potentially
contacted person. Consequently, we have a dilution effect
on the contagion that must be reflected in the growth of
the epidemics. In the present work, we have studied how
the existence of asymmetrical virus transmission rules
affects such growth, and how the fraction of infected patients with a certain blood type should not depend only
on the patient blood type but on the number of infected
people that may infect him.
To this aim, we expanded the usual SIR formalism to
take into consideration the possible effect of blood antigenicity in the COVID-19 transmission. Generally, to
solve the set of generalized SIR Equations (16)-(18) for
any time, researchers have relied on numerics. Here, we
suggest a different approach, and we provided analytical solutions in the small-time limit, where the epidemics
is in its exponential-growing regime. We obtained an
expression linking the inverse characteristic time of the

exponential phase with the abundances of the different
blood groups in the population. We propose a set of sus(k)
(k)
ceptibility indices: pi for the sub-population i and pT
for the total population.
Here, we faced the problem from a general point of view
and proposed a theoretical framework able to consider
any set of rules based on blood groups. Then we focus on
the case k = 2 that describes a hypothetical set of rules
based on the Rhesus group (i may be 1 or 2 respectively
for Rh+ and Rh−) and the case k = 4 for the AB0
system.
Given a set of rules, the model predicts a linear dependence of the observed epidemic inverse timescale m
with the total susceptibility. To test the model, we first
compare its predictions with the experimental data provided in [22, 42], where the blood type of infected people
of two Chinese regions was collected. Comparing the
population frequencies of blood groups with those found
in the infected sub-population, we verified that the proposed contagion scheme well describes the observed frequencies, since the difference observed between the ABO
blood type population distribution and the ABO blood
type infected people distribution supports the validity
of the infection scheme proposed in [24]. A similar approach has been used to test the model for the Denmark
data [37], characterized by an overall higher statistics,
and again we found good accordance with the model.
Next, we consider all data reported in Table I. Notably, the linear trend remains although data points are
more scattered. We noted that most of the added sets
of data were obtained considering only severely ill individuals and hospitalized individuals as a negative control. While our model only accounts for the effects of
blood groups in the transmission of the virus, the ABH
phenotype could in principle impact both the course of
the COVID disease and the general health of individuals.
Consequently, considering severely ill patients and hospitalized people as controls may introduce biases in both
the di and fi distributions, which reflect on a higher dispersion of the data in Figure 4.
To further validate our model, we analyzed the infection curves of a large set of countries worldwide, comparing the characteristic time of the infection outbreak with
the prediction of our model based on the known blood
group distribution for each country. Note that in this
second case, we do not have the information about the
blood groups of the infected population but only on the
whole population. Thus, we can compare the growth rate
in the short time, exponential, phase with the “suscepti(k)
bility” pT proposed by the model.
We managed to collect data on the blood frequencies
and the infections for 78 different countries belonging to
four well distinct geographical areas, i.e. Europe, Asia,
South America, and Africa. Since we expect that differences both geographical and on the lifestyles affect the
infection and recovering rates we kept the countries separated according to the four identified areas. This allows
us to discard possible bias due to data collection and

14
geographical factors. Using a set of rules based on Rhesus blood types, we observed an always not significant
correlation. From the point of view of the biological interpretation of the results, this is not surprising. A set
of rules solely based on the Rh factor would not support
the working hypothesis, which is based on the presence
of glycan antigens on the viral capsid.
On the contrary, considering the ABO set of rules,
three out of the four areas present a very good agreement between data and model prediction (see Table III).
Summing up, it seems that the AB0 blood type has an
effect on the virus spreading pattern.
In a nutshell, we proposed a generalized SIR model
with infection rules dictated by antigenicity between different blood types. Obtaining an analytical solution of
the model for the exponential phase, we were able to
provide a rigorous theoretical test of the hypothesis proposed in [24]. We have made the test both for local
data, where the number of infected people is stratified
by blood type, and, on a wider scale, analyzing the infection growth curves of 78 countries worldwide. Overall,
the present study reaches the conclusion that the hypoth-

esis of a blood type effect on the COVID-19 advanced in
[24] it is not falsified by the available observational epidemic data. Obviously, to strengthen the validation of
the hypothesis in [24] a direct detection of the antigens
linked to the SARS-CoV-2 is needed, but this goes far
beyond the goals of the present paper, which aims at
presenting a mathematical framework to validate the hypothesis in [24] on patient level and country level data,
and to allow us to understand the relation between the
regional infection growth rate and the population blood
type distribution. As a final note, we observe that, besides blood types, other population dependent antigens
distribution may play a role in the geographically heterogeneous infection spreading [54].
