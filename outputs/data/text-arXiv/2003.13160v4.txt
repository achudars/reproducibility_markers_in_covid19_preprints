Abstract. We study the epidemic spreading on spatial networks where the
probability that two nodes are connected decays with their distance as a power law. As
the exponent of the distance dependence grows, model networks smoothly transition
from the random network limit to the regular lattice limit. We show that despite
keeping the average number of contacts constant, the increasing exponent hampers the
epidemic spreading by making long-distance connections less frequent. The spreading
dynamics is influenced by the distance-dependence exponent as well and changes from
exponential growth to power-law growth. The observed power-law growth is compatible
with recent analyses of empirical data on the spreading of COVID-19 in numerous
countries.

1. Introduction
Mathematical modeling of epidemic processes has a long tradition [1, 2, 3]. After the
rise of the network science [4, 5], the study of epidemic spreading on networks has led
to a flourishing of literature [6, 7, 8, 9]. The important insights obtained in this scope
include, for example, the impact of network hubs [10] and long-distance connections [11]
on the epidemic spreading, and the effective spreading geometry [12].
By contrast, efforts addressing epidemics on spatial networks with prevailing short
connections are comparatively few. In view of the unprecedented movement and activity
restrictions that are being introduced in countries across the globe to curb the spreading
of the new virus COVID-19 [13], this is a research gap that calls to be addressed.
Of particular interest are the temporal patterns of the COVID-19 epidemic as there
is now extensive empirical evidence that the progress of COVID-19 is power-law in
China [14, 15, 16], Chinese provinces [17, 18], as well as other countries [18, 19].
Observed power-law growth is very different from the classical exponential growth
that follows from the assumption of homogeneous mixing [1, 2]. To account for this
observation, [17] introduced a modified SIR model which assumes that the supply
of susceptible individuals gradually decreases as a consequence of the implemented
containment policies. While the model produces sub-exponential growth and fits the
data (prior to February 12, 2020) well, the connection between containment policies
which are typically introduced abruptly (such as a curfew issued by a government) and
the gradual depletion of susceptible individuals is unclear. On scale-free networks with
a diverging second moment of the degree distribution, early power-law growth with the
exponent D − 1 where D is the network diameter (the maximal distance between two
nodes in the graph) has been found for the SIR epidemic model [20]. Even when broad
degree distributions are characteristic for social networks [21, 22], it is questionable
whether a diverging second moment of the degree distribution is a relevant assumption
for the contact networks over which COVID-19 spreads in the times of widely-introduced
social-distancing rules.
We study here epidemic spreading on model spatial networks introduced in [23]
where a single parameter can be used to gradually shift from a random network
limit (where links are drawn independently of the spatial node distance and longrange connections are common) to a regular lattice limit (where only the nearestneighbors are connected). Epidemic spreading in the lattice limit is well understood and
characteristic by quadratic growth [24, 14] except for the critical regime [25]. The spatial
network model thus allows us to study the continuous transition between quadratic and
exponential growth. A comparison with power-law growth in empirical data, in turn,
gives us insights into the contact network over which the epidemic spreads. While
contact tracking is the best source of information on the contact network, the contract
tracking data are not available now. Investigating the effect of various contact network
topologies on the epidemic spreading is hence an option of gaining early insights in the
structure of the contact network.

We find that spatial networks where short links are favored facilitate epidemic
spreading significantly less than random networks.
Together with epidemic
characteristics of a considered pathogen, the spatial network structure is thus crucial for
the final extent of an outbreak. Furthermore, the epidemic dynamics in these networks
features power-law growth with exponents varying in a broad range depending on the
network characteristics, in agreement with extensive empirical evidence of power-law
growth for the COVID-19 pandemic [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. Our results thus provide
an indirect way of probing the structure of actual contact networks over which the
virus spreads, as well as suggestions for making these networks less permissible to the
virus. Note that we purposely avoid the question of epidemic predictions which has been
addressed using phenomenological fits [26, 27, 28] and extensive agent-based models [29]
elsewhere.
2. Previous work
The spatial network model that we use here was originally introduced in [23] as a
candidate model for social networks. The model is based on connection probability
Q(d) which decays with the geometric distance between the nodes. It was shown that
when Q(d) decays as a power-law with an exponent between 2.5 and 3.5, the resulting
networks exhibit the small-world phenomenon: they have simultaneously high clustering
and short average shortest paths. In this respect, the spatial decay exponent plays
the same role as the rewiring probability in the classical Watts-Strogatz model [30]
with small-world networks produced for intermediate values of the network parameter.
The degree distribution of networks produced by the original spatial network model is
narrow (Poissonian) which markedly differs from degree distributions commonly found
in empirical social networks. This shortcoming is addressed in [31] where nodes are
endowed with an additional parameter which quantifies how “social” is a given node.
A power-law degree distribution then emerges for some distributions of the parameters’
values among the nodes whilst maintaining the networks’ small-world property.
An epidemic process with spatially distributed sites and space-dependent
interaction rates is sometimes referred to as the generalized epidemic process (GEP)
in the literature [25, 32]. While space-dependent epidemic processes and spatial
epidemiology in general [33] have a long history, the very basic question of the dynamics
of epidemics on spatial networks has been not been fully studied yet. The critical
behavior of the GEP was characterized in [25]. In [34], a SIR model on spatial
networks with distance-dependent connectivity has been studied in one dimension.
Assuming slowly-decaying spatial interactions, the authors find exponential epidemic
growth to best fit their simulation results early on. Epidemic spreading on planar
random geometric networks (networks where nodes are randomly distributed in a plane
and links exist bellow some node distance) has been studied in [35], for example,
without addressing its temporal dynamics. In [36], data fits and predictions were
compared for epidemic models based on spatial interactions with Gaussian and power-

law decay. Using weekly aggregated data covering several years of seasonal variations
of meningococcal infections and influenza infections in Germany, the authors found
statistical support for a power-law spatial decay of interactions. Besides these works
based on individual-level modeling of epidemics, spatially coupled populations have been
considered in metapopulation epidemic models [11, 37].
3. Preliminaries
3.1. Empirical data
As we have already mentioned, empirical dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic has been
already studied in a great number of works [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 26, 27, 28]. To provide
a direct motivation for our study of power-law patterns in epidemic dynamics, we offer
here a simple vizualization of empirical data on COVID-19 fatalities in Switzerland.
We choose the fatalities count as the other candidate characteristic, the number of
confirmed cases, is affected by issues such as asymptomatic cases, the extent of testing,
and the choice of the tested individuals. We utilize the data used by the website
http://www.corona-data.ch/; the data have been collected and published under the
OpenZH program of the Swiss government (see https://open.zh.ch). The data covers
the period from the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Switzerland (February 25, 2020)
until April 27, 2020. As can be seen in Figure 1, the empirical curves are straight
over a substantial part of the reported period in the log-log plot (panel A), suggesting
a power-law growth pattern, instead of being straight in the log-linear plot (panel B)
which would suggest an exponential growth pattern. As a direct consequence of strict
country-wide social distancing rules (e.g., all meetings over 5 people were banned on
March 20), the growth slows down substantially after day 30, approximately.

For each δ, λ is chosen to achieve the mean degree z = 4. The inset shows the mean
link length,
√ √E(l), as a function of the exponent δ. For N = 40, 000, the longest possible
link is N 2/2 ≈ 141 and the mean length of random links is 77.

3.2. Spatial network model
In a spatial complex network, the probability that two nodes are connected is given
by the distance between them [7]. We use here the model introduced in [23] where N
nodes form a two-dimensional square lattice with the elementary square of size one and
periodic boundary conditions; we assume for simplicity that N = S 2 where S is a natural
number. In this model, the probability that two nodes are connected depends only on
their geometric distance d, hence the original label “network with distance-dependent
connectivity”, as
1
P (d) =
(1)
1 + λdδ
where λ and δ are model parameters. The exponent δ determines how fast P (d) decays
with distance and λ can be used to achieve a desired mean degree, z, in the resulting
network. When P (d) is small, it changes slowly with d, and δ > 2, mean node degree
can be approximated as
Z ∞
2π 2 λ−2/δ
z≈
2πrP (r) dr =
(2)
δ sin(2π/δ)
0
in the limit of N → ∞ [31]. For the sake of generality, we always determine λ necessary
to achieve a desired mean degree numerically by evaluating the mean degree in generated
networks, even for parameter settings where λ determined from (2) would be of sufficient
precision.
By contrast to the simpler form P (d) ∼ d−δ used in [38], the absolute term in the
denominator conveniently avoids the divergence of P (d) when d → 0. In [23], the authors
show that (1) with 2.5 . δ . 3.5 produces small-world networks where the average
shortest paths are “short” and the clustering coefficient values are high. The model
thus formalizes what has been anticipated by previous analyses of the COVID-19 data:
“individuals have many local neighbors and occasional long-range connections” [15].
See [36] for further evidence for the use of power-law decay in epidemics modeling.

Figure 2 shows that as δ grows, links in model networks become shorter. When
δ  1, short links have much higher probability and the network is nearly regular as the
nodes are mostly connected with their z closest neighbors. The opposite limit, δ → 0, is
also instructive: node distance then becomes irrelevant and the connection probability
is the same, 1/(1 + λ), for all nodes. We thus recover the classical random network [39].
The original spatial model produces a narrow degree distribution which is typically
not a good fit for real social networks [21, 22]. This limitation can be overcome by
assigning individual λ values to all nodes and making (1) dependent on the λ values of
the considered pair of nodes [31]. We use
1
(3)
P (dij ) =
1 + min(λi , λj )dδ
as the probability that nodes i and j with distance dij and respective values λi and
λj are connected. Note that a smaller λ value in (1) leads to a higher connection
probability. By using the minimum λ value in (3), we thus make it possible that a
node with a small λ value connects with many nodes in the network. Albeit this choice
slightly differs from the one used in [31], the tail behavior of the degree distribution
remains unchanged. In particular, λ distributed among the nodes as %(λ) ∼ λx in
λ ∈ (0, λmax ] has been shown in [31] to lead to a power-law tail of the degree distribution
with the exponent γ = δ(x + 1)/2. The upper bound of the λ distribution, λmax , directly
determines the mean degree. We use this approach to generate spatial networks with
the degree distribution exponents 3.5 and 2.5, respectively. We use the basic network
model characterized by a single λ value and (1) unless stated otherwise.
3.3. Epidemic model
We use a SEIR epidemic model [2, 40] where each node can be in one of four possible
states: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), and recovered (R). All nodes are
initially susceptible except for one node which is exposed. The exposed nodes represent
the individuals who have already contracted the disease but have not developed the
symptoms yet. In the case of COVID-19, these individuals have been shown to
significantly contribute to spreading the disease [41].
The epidemic takes place on a fixed contact network and the simulation runs in
time steps with one step representing one day. If susceptible node i is connected with
an exposed node, the probability that node i becomes exposed is β1 . If susceptible node
i is connected with an infected node, the probability that node i becomes exposed is β2 .
In the simulations, we go over all nodes in a random order in each turn and if a node is
exposed or infected, we make its susceptible neighbors exposed with probabilities β1 or
β2 , respectively. While the infection process is probabilistic, we assume for simplicity
that the disease progression is deterministic: If a node becomes exposed at time step t,
it automatically becomes infected (develops disease symptoms) at the end of step t + T1
and recovered at the end of step t + T1 + T2 . Here T1 is the incubation period and T2 is
the recovery time. Recovered nodes cannot contract the disease again.

We use T1 = 5, T2 = 14, and β2 /β1 = 0.2 which reflects the role of asymptomatic
agents in the spreading process [41]. When β1 is sufficiently small, the probability that a
node infects a given neighbor is β1 T1 while in the E-state and β2 T2 while in the I-state.
For the specified parameter values, the probability of infecting a neighbor while in the Estate is 5 × 5/14 ≈ 1.8 fold with respect to the I-state which is in the range suggested by
the empirical literature (see [42, 43] for the latest epidemiology information on COVID19). While the choice of the model and its parameters are motivated by the ongoing
COVID-19 epidemic, the presented findings are robust with respect to the choice of the
epidemic model and the parameter values. Note that we study specifically the supercritical regime where the disease spreads through the population and eventually reaches
a significant fraction of the whole population. This is different from, for example, [25]
where the critical behavior of epidemic spreading was addressed.
We simulate 300 time steps of the epidemic spreading. Median over 10,000
independent realizations of the epidemic process is used to find a representative epidemic
outcome at any time point. We measure the epidemic spreading using the number of
affected nodes which includes exposed, infected and recovered nodes, so it is naturally a
cumulative metric which quantifies how many nodes have contracted the disease during
the simulation time.
4. Results
We now move to results of numerical simulations of epidemic spreading on model spatial
networks. Before addressing the dynamics of the epidemic process, Figure 3 shows that
the spatial distribution of links, controlled in the model by the exponent δ, has strong
impact on the epidemic spreading. In particular, the fraction of infected nodes at a
given time decreases as δ grows. This is a direct consequence of the spatially-constrained
epidemic spreading when δ is large: Many neighbors of an infected node are then already
infected, so the node’s effective ability to spread the disease further is reduced. By
contrast, neighbors of an infected node in a random network are unlikely to be already
infected (unless a significant fraction of all nodes have been infected) which facilitates

further spreading. In summary, the epidemic spreading can be effectively suppressed
by both lowering the number of contacts (in the case of COVID-19, in particular close
contacts that we spend prolonged time together indoors [44]) as well as by avoiding longdistance contacts. A comparatively higher number of short-distance social contacts can
lead to the same, or even lower, final fraction of infected population than a lower number
of widely distributed social contacts.
The effect of δ can be readily understood by inspecting the spreading patterns
for various values of δ shown in Figure 4. When δ is high (δ = 6), the epidemic
spreads almost as on a regular lattice (see the first panel) and develops a clearly-defined
spreading front. Nodes on the front, that can spread the infection further, can only
spread it in one direction (outwards) which limits their effective reproduction number
(number of nodes that they infect on average). As δ decreases, the spreading front
first becomes “diffuse” (δ = 4) until it “dissolves” entirely (δ = 2). The epidemic then
spreads more effectively as it is more probable that a neighbor of an infected nodes is
susceptible to the infection. The qualitative change from a spatially localized spreading
(when δ is high) to a delocalized spreading (the last panel in Figure 4) occurs when
the average link length, E(l), diverges (i.e., for δ ≤ 3). As the infection spreads over
network links, the geometric speed of infection spreading then diverges too.
We now return to the main question: the effect of the spatial network structure on
the dynamics of epidemic spreading. This dynamics has two well-known special cases.
On a random contact network, the assumption of homogeneous mixing of susceptible and
infected nodes is valid and one recovers the classical exponential epidemic growth [2].
On a regular two-dimensional lattice with nearest-neighbor connections, the epidemic
spreading instead develops an epidemic front that propagates at a constant velocity.
The front’s constant velocity then directly implies that the radius of the affected area
grows linearly with time and, consequently, the number of infected individuals grows
quadratically with time [24].
Spatial networks with distance-dependent connectivity give us the possibility to
smoothly transition between the two extremes (regular lattice and classical random

While the solid lines show results for spatial networks generated with different exponent
values in (1), the dotted and dashed lines show results for a random network and
a regular lattice, respectively. Straight lines in the log-log panel (A) are indicative
of power-law growth. Straight lines in the log-linear panel (B) are indicative of
exponential growth. As in Figure 4, we use N = 160, 000, z = 4, and β1 = 0.160.
We display here a median of 10,000 epidemic realizations on a single network.

Figure 5A. To focus on the straight part of the dependencies, we fit only the values
below N/2 infected cases and above 100–800 infected cases. The reported ranges of
the fitted exponents are obtained by varying the fitting lower bounds. The exponent
estimates for δ = 3 vary in comparatively broader ranges, indicating that power-law
growth is not a good fit in this case (the same is true for δ = 2, results not shown).
The first two rows show results for the basic spatial network model with different
mean degree values, z. The next row shows results for the spatial network model with
a power-law degree distribution with the exponent γ = 3.5.

network). We can thus directly observe how quadratic growth on a lattice changes in
exponential growth on a random network. Figure 4 provides the first indication with
the epidemic front becoming more diffuse and the speed of its propagation grows as δ
decreases. As this happens, the argument leading to quadratic growth ceases to be valid
and we expect the growth to be faster than quadratic. This is confirmed by Figure 5
where we show the epidemic dynamics for various contact networks. Growth that is of
a power-law kind (it follows a straight line over a substantial part of the log-log plane
in panel A) for the 2D lattice as well as for the spatial networks with δ & 4 becomes
clearly exponential for the random network and for the spatial network with δ = 2 (see
the straight lines in the log-linear panel B). Note that the results obtained on random
networks and the regular square lattice are very close to the displayed results for δ = 2
and δ = 6, respectively.

Figure 6. Time evolution of the number of affected nodes for large spatial networks
(log-log scale). We use N = 2, 560, 000, z = 4, and β1 = 0.160. We display here a
median of 1,000 epidemic realizations on a single network.

We find that quadratic epidemic growth on 2D lattices generalizes to power-law
growth on the model spatial networks with sufficiently high exponent δ. Table 1 shows
that for the data shown in Figure 5A, stable estimates of the growth exponent (indicating
good power-law fits of the data) can be obtained for δ greater or equal to 4. The resulting
power-law growth exponents supported by simulations with N = 160, 000 nodes lie in
the range 2–3.25 (for δ = 3, power law ceases to fit well). This range of exponents agrees
well with the exponents found in empirifcal data [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. A comparison with
the results obtained for N = 40, 000 (results not shown) suggests that as N grows,
the range of δ where a power-law fits the data well expands. Notably, the power-law
exponent is more than two even for the square lattice (for the same fitting procedure as
in Table 1, we obtain 2.17–2.19). This is due to the probabilistic nature of the spreading
that results in non-vanishing randomness of the spreading front that can be well seen
in the first panel of Figure 4. Simulations at larger N = 2, 560, 000 (Figure 6) show
analogous behavior, confirming that the observed growth patterns are not significantly
influenced by finite-size effects. The fitted slopes 5.4, 3.2, 2.4 and 2.2 for δ = 3, 4, 5, 6,
respectively, agree with the slopes obtained for N = 160, 000. Since the original network
construction scales poorly as it requires checking all possible pairs of nodes which results
in complexity O(N 2 ), we accelerate it in this case by checking only pairs of nodes
whose distance is less than 200 (all other simulation aspects and parameters remain the
same). In this way, only a minor fraction of long links is omitted for δ ≥ 3 shown in
Figure 6. We finally note that the considered epidemic spreading model assumes no
fundamental difference between infections by exposed nodes and infected nodes (except
for the infection rate, of course), so the ratio T1 /T2 does not influence the results despite
affecting the relative proportion of exposed and infected nodes.
In [19, 45], the authors observe power-law growth in various countries and infer that
the underlying networks must be scale-free and small-world (the small-world property
is hypothesized also in [16, 15]). We now see that this is not necessarily the case: The
spatial networks considered here can produce power-law growth when δ & 4 yet they
have narrow degree distributions [31] (i.e., they are not scale-free) and [23] shows that

which, as we already used in Figure 4, half of all nodes become affected at the end of
simulation when δ = 6.

high exponents in the distance dependence do not generate sufficiently many long-range
links for the small-world phenomenon to emerge. We find instead that power-law growth
with an exponent above two suggests that the contact network is spatially embedded
and consists predominantly of short links.
We finally explore how variations of the underlying network change the estimated
power-law growth exponents, b̂ (see Table 1 for the detailed results). When the mean
degree increases, b̂ increases and this increase is more pronounced (up to 10%) for small
δ values. This is actually expected as higher z means that nodes on the epidemic front
have more opportunities to have long-distance connections which, in turn, accelerates
the epidemic front’s movement forward. An increase of b̂ can be also observed when
(3) is used to produce spatial networks with a power-law degree distribution. When
the degree distribution exponent is γ = 3.5, b̂ increases by up to 13% with respect
to the original model with z = 4. Interestingly, power-law epidemic growth then
appears to fit the data even better (e.g., the exponent ranges in Table 1 are narrower)
than for the original networks with narrow degree distributions. While the networks’

fractal dimensions [38] are similar to the power-law exponents obtained by fitting the
epidemic growth, substantial differences (e.g., fractal dimension between 3.9 and 4.0 for
N = 160, 000, z = 10 and δ = 4 as opposed to the epidemics growth exponent, b̂, around
3.55 for the same parameters) can be observed in some cases. These differences stem
from the fact that while the evaluation of a network’s fractal dimension is deterministic,
it uses only on the network’s structure, the epidemic dynamics is inherently stochastic,
driven by both the network structure as well as details of the studied epidemic process.
Differences between the fractal dimension and the epidemic growth exponents are
expected to further magnify when link weights, affecting the epidemic spreading but
irrelevant to the computation of the fractal dimension, are introduced.
The situation becomes very different when the degree distribution exponent γ is
2.5: the power-law parts of the epidemic growth then have higher exponents (4.2 for
δ = 6 and 5.9 for δ = 5). However, the range over which power-law growth can be
observed shrinks substantially and exponential growth becomes a better description for
the growth pattern. This is illustrated in Figure 7 which shows a direct comparison of
the growth dynamics on original spatial networks and spatial networks with power-law
degree distributions. The change of behavior for γ = 2.5 is a direct consequence of
a diverging second moment of the degree distribution, hk 2 i, for a power-law exponent
below 3; hk 2 i has been shown crucial for the dynamics of epidemic spreading on networks
with heterogeneous degree distributions [10]. Results remain qualitatively the same
when a different infection rate β1 is used.
5. Discussion
In this work, we studied the interplay between the functional form of the connection
probability in spatial networks and the dynamics of epidemic spreading on them. There
are two main findings. Firstly, short (localized) links hinder the spreading. A better
outcome (fewer infections and slower epidemics growth) can be thus achieved by limiting
distant contacts even if the mean number of contacts remains fixed. Secondly, when short
links prevail in the network, the number of infected individuals grows as a power law
instead of the canonical exponential epidemic growth. In the framework of the chosen
connection probability decaying with node distance as a power law, frequent short links
are achieved when the exponent of the connection probability decay is sufficiently high.
In our simulations, in particular, power-law growth of the number of infections emerges
when this decay exponent is greater than, approximately, four. This observation is
particularly relevant as the latest data show that the COVID-19 spreading in most
countries indeed follows a power-law pattern instead of exponential growth. Our results
point to short (spatially) social contacts as a candidate mechanism behind the observed
power-law growth of COVID-19.
We stress that the studied mechanism leading to power-law growth of the number
of infections is very different from the setting studied in [20] where a diverging second
moment of the degree distribution is the main reason for sub-exponential growth. It

remains open whether the degree distribution of the effective contact network over
which COVID-19 spreads has a diverging second moment, in particular as a major
epidemic outbreak necessarily affects the behavior of individuals and incites significant
government interventions and society-wide restrictions. By contrast, the original spatial
model that we consider here produces narrow (Poissonian) degree distributions, yet
we find power-law epidemic growth as a consequence of spatially-constrained linking
patterns which, in turn, determine the spreading dynamics. Our results thus show that
neither the scale-free property (hypothesized in [19, 45]), nor the small-world property
(hypothesized in [16, 15]) are necessary for power-law epidemics growth to emerge.
Note that the result obtained in [20] includes power-law growth combined with
exponential decay. While this exponential decay term can be conveniently used to
fit the slowing epidemic data [28], the source of this decay is the shrinking size of the
susceptible population which, fortunately, is not a significant effect for COVID-19 which
has yet affected a minor fraction of the world’s population. In the scope of fitting the
COVID-19 data, the exponential decay term has to be thus viewed as phenomenological.
To better understand the impact of various features of the contact network on the
resulting epidemic spreading, several modifications and generalizations of the network
model can be studied in the future: (1) replacing individual nodes with households where
each node has local connections to all other household members and distance-dependent
connectivity is used to model the connections to individuals in other households, (2)
introducing link weights that represent the intensity of the social contact and naturally
play a role in the disease transmission, (3) consider interventions and social distancing
that vary in time. Finding an analytical relation between the epidemic growth exponent
and the connectivity decay exponent δ in the basic model, and formulating effective
differential equations that describe the epidemic dynamics on spatial networks are other
important directions.
