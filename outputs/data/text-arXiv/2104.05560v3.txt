Abstract
Objective To evaluate the relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis with
SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 (also known as Variant of Concern 202012/01) and the risk of
hospitalisation compared to diagnosis with wildtype SARS-CoV-2 variants.
Design Retrospective cohort, analysed using stratified Cox regression.
Setting Community-based SARS-CoV-2 testing in England, individually linked with hospitalisation
data.
Participants 839,278 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, of whom 36,233 had been
hospitalised within 14 days, tested between 23rd November 2020 and 31st January 2021 and
analysed at a laboratory with an available TaqPath assay that enables assessment of S-gene target
failure (SGTF). SGTF is a proxy test for the B.1.1.7 variant. Patient data were stratified by age, sex,
ethnicity, deprivation, region of residence, and date of positive test.
Main outcome measures Hospitalisation between 1 and 14 days after the first positive SARS-CoV-2
test.
Results 27,710 of 592,409 SGTF patients (4.7%) and 8,523 of 246,869 non-SGTF patients (3.5%) had
been hospitalised within 1-14 days. The stratum-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of hospitalisation was
1.52 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.47 to 1.57) for COVID-19 patients infected with SGTF variants,
compared to those infected with non-SGTF variants. The effect was modified by age (P<0.001), with
HRs of 0.93—1.21 for SGTF compared to non-SGTF patients below age 20 years, 1.29 in those aged
20-29, and 1.45—1.65 in age groups 30 years or older. The estimated adjusted risk of hospitalisation
within 14 days was 4.7% (95% CI 4.6% to 4.7%) for SGTF and 3.5% (95% CI 3.4% to 3.5%) for nonSGTF patients.
Conclusions The results suggest that the risk of hospitalisation is higher for individuals infected with
the B.1.1.7 variant compared to wildtype SARS-CoV-2, likely reflecting a more severe disease. The
higher severity may be specific to adults above the age of 30.

What is already known on this topic
• The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant was discovered in England in December 2020 and has now
become the dominant lineage in the country, owing to a higher transmissibility than
wildtype SARS-CoV-2.
• Some evidence suggests that B.1.1.7 is associated with more severe disease, but the studies
that have found an association with increased mortality may have been limited by
confounding due to increased local hospital burden caused by the increased transmissibility
of the variant.
• Hospitalisation as a measurement of disease severity is less likely than mortality to be
positively confounded by hospital burden.
What this study adds
• Based on linkage of nationwide community SARS-CoV-2 testing data with routine hospital
admission records, we found that COVID-19 patients who tested positive for the B.1.1.7
variant had a 1.52-fold hazard of hospitalisation within 1-14 days of the first positive test
(95% confidence interval 1.47 to 1.57) compared to COVID-19 patients with wildtype
variants.
• The results likely reflect a more severe disease associated with the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7
variant, particularly in individuals aged 30 or above.

1. Background
Since its discovery in England in December 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant has been reported
in 114 countries globally.[1] In England, the prevalence of B.1.1.7 rapidly increased and it has now
become the predominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage,[2] prompting the re-implementation of social and
physical distancing measures to control infection rates. These measures included closures of schools,
non-essential retail and hospitality outlets and stay at home orders.[3]
Initial concerns around B.1.1.7 emerged from analyses which determined a higher
transmissibility.[2,4,5] On 18th December 2020, the variant was re-designated as a Variant of
Concern (VOC-202012/01) and subsequent studies have found B.1.1.7 to be associated with higher
mortality than other SARS-CoV-2 variants.[6–10]
The burden of COVID-19 on hospital services is a key measure outlined by the UK government on
progress in controlling the pandemic, influencing decisions on how quickly social and physical
distancing measures can be removed. As B.1.1.7 is now the predominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage in
England, any potential increased likelihood of hospitalisation with this variant will impact the
national healthcare burden and decisions on lifting restrictions.
Initial assessments of hospitalisation were based on ecological analyses, looking at distribution of
variant cases in comparison to the levels of healthcare demand at different geographies.[5,11,12]
More recently, a higher risk of admission to critical care has been reported for community-tested
COVID-19 patients.[9] One study, based on whole genome sequencing, has reported on the risk of
hospitalisation using individual-level follow-up of COVID-19 patients with B.1.1.7 compared to
wildtype SARS-CoV-2.[13] However, that study was limited by a moderate sample size due to
operational constraints of sequencing, leading to wide confidence intervals for the risk estimates.
Hospitalisations linked to individual variant cases based on routine testing data in England, which
provide a larger sample size, have not yet been analysed, leaving a gap in the available evidence.
The B.1.1.7 genetic profile includes a deletion of six nucleotides in the S-gene and has been
associated with target failures for this gene in PCR testing using a three-gene assay (ORF1ab, N gene
and S-gene). While other mutations can also cause an S-gene target failure (SGTF), more than 90% of
sequenced SGTF samples since the week commencing 23 November 2020 were confirmed as
matching the B.1.1.7 profile.[2] Therefore, SGTF provides an indicator from routine PCR testing that
can be used as a proxy for B.1.1.7 and that is more rapidly and widely available than sequencing
results.
The aim of this study was to assess whether there is a causal relationship between infection with the
B.1.1.7 variant, compared to infection with wildtype SARS-CoV-2 variants, and the risk of
hospitalisation. A secondary aim was to re-estimate the mortality risk for patients with the B.1.1.7
variant compared to wildtype variants, that has been reported in previous analyses of the study
dataset.[6,7]

2. Methods
2.1 Identification of confirmed COVID-19 patients by SGTF status
Most SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests in England are performed through the national mass testing
programmes.[14] The “Pillar 1” testing programme includes testing by hospital and public health
laboratories on request of a health professional for a clinical indication, some testing for public
health investigations, and occupational testing of health professionals. The “Pillar 2” testing
programme includes large-scale PCR testing of respiratory specimens for SARS-CoV-2 infection in
Lighthouse laboratories, predominantly for community-originated testing.[15] These laboratories
may receive specimens from testing nationwide depending on demand, and so individual
laboratories do not have a fixed geographical coverage. Confirmed COVID-19 patients with SGTF
were identified from results uploaded to the Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS) from the
three Lighthouse laboratories using TaqPath assays (Milton Keynes, Alderley Park and Glasgow
Lighthouse Laboratories). The identification of these records relied on cycle threshold (CT) values
being reported into SGSS from these three laboratories.
We included COVID-19 patients with a positive PCR test from Pillar 2 between 23rd November 2020
and 31st January 2021 and whose specimen had been analysed in one of the TaqPath assay
Lighthouse laboratories. Tests from Pillar 1 were not analysed at Lighthouse laboratories and hence
have not routinely been assessed for SGTF status on a national basis. SGTF patients were defined as
those patients who had CT values that met the definition for SGTF (ORF1ab and N-gene targets with
CT values ≤30 and no values detected for the S-gene). Non-SGTF patients were defined as those
patients who had CT values ≤30 at all targets (ORF1ab, N-gene and S-gene). The inclusion period was
chosen because SGTF is unspecific to the B.1.1.7 variant and therefore has low positive predictive
value when the prevalence of B.1.1.7 is low. Due to the increasing prevalence of B.1.1.7, the positive
predictive value of SGTF analysis has been >90% for samples collected in England since the week
commencing 23rd November 2020.[2] We stopped the inclusion by 31st January 2021, because >95%
of the analysed samples had SGTF thereafter.[2]
Laboratory data for all included patients were extracted from SGSS and included information on the
potential confounders age, sex, ethnicity, area of residence, and index of multiple deprivation (IMD).
The dataset was deduplicated to only include each patient’s first positive SARS-CoV-2 test.
2.2 Assessment of hospitalisation and death
All patients were linked to the Secondary Uses Service (SUS) [16] dataset and the Emergency Care
Data Set (ECDS) [17] to obtain information on hospital admissions, as previously described.[18] SUS
is an administrative dataset which includes healthcare and hospitalisation data for completed
admissions and treatments submitted to NHS Digital. SUS data is not reported until a hospital
admission episode is complete (i.e. transfer, discharge or death); ongoing hospitalisations are not
included in this dataset. This information can be complemented with ECDS, a similar administrative
dataset recording attendances at Emergency Departments, including hospital admissions following
emergency room attendance, thus providing another route to capture hospitalisation earlier than in
SUS.
SUS/ECDS data were extracted and linked with the laboratory data, including hospitalisation records
up to the 19th May 2021. If a COVID-19 patient was detected in SUS, they were classified as

5

hospitalised with COVID-19 if they entered the hospital between 1 and 14 days following their
specimen date. If the individual was detected in ECDS only, they were classified as hospitalised if
they had a discharge status of “Admitted” or “Transferred” and their attendance date was between
1 and 14 days following their specimen date. The timeframe of 1-14 days was based on a preliminary
descriptive analysis ignoring SGTF status, that indicated that most hospitalisations occurred within
14 days; we explored including later hospitalisations in an additional analysis. Data were not
consistently available on the reason for hospital admission and we therefore included all
hospitalisations recorded within this timeframe. Individuals who first tested positive on or after their
hospital admission were excluded to avoid bias of healthcare-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infections or
testing at admission for non-COVID-19-related hospitalisation for infection control purposes.
Similarly, individuals in hospital within 6 weeks prior to testing positive were excluded from analysis,
due to the possibility of hospital-acquired infection.
The data were further linked to a dataset of COVID-19 deaths collated by Public Health England
(PHE) from the following streams: (i) deaths occurring in hospitals, notified to NHS England by NHS
trusts, (ii) deaths among COVID-19-positive individuals, notified to PHE Health Protection Teams
during outbreak management, (iii) laboratory test result reports linked with death reports from NHS
records, and (iv) death registrations where COVID-19 was mentioned on the death certificate that
could be retrospectively linked to a laboratory confirmed COVID-19 test.[19]
2.3 Potential confounders
The risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation in England has been reported to be positively associated with
age, male sex, deprivation, and Black or Asian minority ethnicity.[20] A previous analysis noted that
the prevalence of SGTF variants among COVID-19 patients in England was higher in younger than
older age groups.[7] The B.1.1.7 variant was discovered in South East England and the outbreak was
initially localised to this and neighbouring regions;[4,5] hence, the prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant
varied by region and calendar period. We therefore treated age, sex, deprivation, ethnicity, region of
residence, and date of specimen as potential confounders due to their known associations with the
exposure and/or outcome.
2.4 Patient and public involvement
This study was observational and based on data from routine healthcare records. No patients were
directly involved in the study.
2.5 Ethical considerations
This surveillance was performed as part of Public Health England’s responsibility to monitor COVID19 during the current pandemic. Public Health England has legal permission, provided by Regulation
3 of The Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002 to process confidential
patient information (http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/1438/regulation/3/made) under
Sections 3(i) (a) to (c), 3(i)(d) (i) and (ii) and 3(3) as part of its outbreak response activities. As such
this work falls outside the remit for ethical review.

2.6 Statistical analysis
2.6.1 Hospitalisation
The primary analysis was a stratified cohort analysis with the aim to estimate the hazard ratio (HR)
of hospitalisation within 1-14 days for patients who tested positive with SGTF compared to non-SGTF
variants, while adjusting for confounding. For this outcome, we followed the patients from the date
of their first positive test until the date of hospitalisation if within 14 days, or censored them at the
date of death or 14 days after the date of first positive test, whichever occurred first. We estimated
age-group-specific absolute risks of hospitalisation for SGTF and non-SGTF patients based on models
stratified by age group.
Using Cox regression, we estimated the crude HR of hospitalisation within 1-14 days after testing
positive for SARS-CoV-2 for SGTF compared to non-SGTF patients. We then estimated an adjusted
HR based on stratification by groups defined by intersecting the potential confounders: 10-year age
group, sex, ethnicity, IMD quintile, region of residence (PHEC), and week of specimen. This model
(henceforth referred to as the “base model”) included SGTF status as a binary covariate, and
additionally included strata-specific linear terms for the quantitative covariates age, IMD rank and
calendar date to account for residual confounding from these covariates within each stratum.
We tested for deviation from the proportional hazard assumption using Schoenfeld tests, and
visually assessed the assumption by examining log-log-transformed Kaplan-Meier plots for SGTF
status and each potential confounder. Because stratification may result in loss of observations, we
assessed the impact on the HR estimate by omitting each of the potential confounders from the
stratification set one by one.
Next, we assessed whether the HR for SGTF was modified by the potential confounders. This was
based on likelihood ratio tests between the base model in which the effect of SGTF was assumed
constant, and the corresponding models that additionally included interaction terms between SGTF
status and each stratification covariate.
In additional analyses, we (1) refitted the base model, stratified by lower tier local authority (LTLA;
316 areas) of residence instead of PHEC (9 regions); and (2) assessed the impact on the results by
refitting the base model considering hospitalisations within 1-60 days. For the latter analysis, we
allowed for time-variation in the HR for SGTF by fitting a model that assumed piecewise constant
HRs by week since positive test, and tested for time-variation using a likelihood ratio test of this
model compared to the model with constant HR.
To estimate adjusted absolute risks of hospitalisation within 14 days by SGTF status, we fitted a Cox
regression model stratified by age group and SGTF status (henceforth referred to as the “absolute
risk model”), including main effects for the remaining potential confounders. This model allows
estimation of absolute risks, under the assumption of multiplicative effects of each covariate on the
hazard. We estimated age-group-specific absolute risks by SGTF status, evaluated at the mean value
of the other potential confounders over all patients. To estimate the corresponding overall absolute
risk, we averaged the age-group-specific estimates over all individuals by SGTF status. We used
bootstrapping (1000 samples) to estimate 95% CIs for the absolute risks.

7

2.6.2 Mortality
In a secondary analysis, we aimed to estimate the adjusted HR of death within 28 days of a positive
test for SGTF compared to non-SGTF patients. For this, the patients were followed from the date of
their first positive test until the date of death if deceased within 28 days, or otherwise they were
censored after 28 days. Because the outcome was rarer compared to hospitalisation, we estimated
the HR based on Cox regression stratified by age, region of residence and week of specimen, and
including main effects for the other potential confounders.
We used Stata software (release 14.1, StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA) for the statistical
analysis.

3. Results
3.1 Description of COVID-19 patients by SGTF status
Within the study period, there were 839,278 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases reported from TaqPath
assay Lighthouse laboratories with valid SGTF status, and who were not hospitalised within 6 weeks
prior to testing positive: 592,409 SGTF patients and 246,869 non-SGTF patients. These patients
represented 41.0% of all confirmed cases during that time. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the
SGTF and non-SGTF patients. The mean age of SGTF patients was 37.6 years, and in the non-SGTF
group the mean age was 37.8 years. There were marked differences by region, with higher
proportions of SGTF patients in London, East of England and the South East; and differences over
time, with the majority of SGTF patients occurring towards the end of December 2020 and the start
of 2021, while non-SGTF patients decreased over time.

3.2 Hospitalisation
There were 27,710 hospitalisations within 1-14 days among the 592,409 SGTF patients (4.7%) and
8,523 among the 246,869 non-SGTF patients (3.5%). Only 911 (0.15%) SGTF and 399 (0.16%) nonSGTF patients died within 14 days without prior hospitalisation; hence, how deaths were treated
would make little difference to the hospitalisation HR estimates.
3.2.1 Hazard ratios
The crude HR of hospitalisation within 1-14 days was 1.36 (95% CI 1.33 to 1.40) for SGTF compared
to non-SGTF patients. Based on the base model, the HR of hospitalisation within 1-14 days was 1.52
(95% CI 1.47 to 1.57). The proportional hazards assumption was violated for this model (P<0.001).
However, this may have reflected a high power to detect minor deviations from proportionality due

9

to the large sample size, and the corresponding log-log plots showed approximately parallel curves
(Appendix Figure A.1).
35,769 (98.7%) of the hospitalised patients were included in the analysis; the remaining 464 (1.3%)
hospitalised patients were in single-individual strata and therefore uninformative. 183,491 (22.8%)
of the non-hospitalised patients were uninformative due to being in a stratum where no individuals
were hospitalised. Hence, a total of 655,323 patients (78.1%) were informative for the base model.
Removing variables from the stratification set allowed the use of more observations and gave similar
results, with HRs ranging from 1.40 to 1.51 (Appendix Table A.1).
Models including interactions between covariates and SGTF indicated no effect modification by sex
(P=0.64), ethnicity (P=0.43), IMD (P=0.69), region of residence (P=0.21), or week (P=0.76). There was
evidence that the effect was modified by age (P<0.001), with little difference in hospitalisation by
SGTF status in those under 20 but rising to HRs in the range 1.45 to 1.65 in those aged 30 and older
(Table 2; Appendix Table A.2).
When refitting the base model using a finer geographic stratification (LTLA) for the areas of
residence instead of PHEC, 29,481 (81.4%) of the hospitalisations and 204,469 (24.4%) of the
observations could be used. The adjusted HR was 1.52 (95% CI 1.47 to 1.58).
Extending the follow-up time, 46,371 SGTF (7.8%) and 16,654 non-SGTF (6.7%) patients had been
hospitalised within 1-60 days of the first positive test. The crude HR of hospitalisation within 1-60
days was 1.17 (95% CI 1.15-1.19), and the corresponding fully stratified HR was 1.25 (95% CI 1.22 to
1.28). The proportional hazards assumption was violated (P<0.001). Consistently, the HR for SGTF
varied with time since first positive test when allowing for a time-varying effect (P<0.001). The
estimated HRs were 1.46 (95% CI 1.40 to 1.52) in days 1-7 after specimen, 1.62 (95% CI 1.54 to 1.70)
in days 8-14, but subsequently close to 1.0 (range 0.91 to 1.03; Appendix Table A.3).
3.2.2 Absolute risks
Table 2 shows the HR estimates for SGTF from the absolute risk model, which were similar to those
from the fully stratified base model, both overall and by age group. Based on this model, Table 2 and
Figure 1 show estimates of the age-group-specific absolute risks of hospitalisation within 14 days
after first positive test by SGTF status, at average levels of the potential confounders over all
patients. The overall estimated absolute risk of hospitalisation after 14 days was 4.7% (95% CI 4.6%
to 4.7%) for SGTF and 3.5% (3.4% to 3.5%) for non-SGTF patients. Most of the hospitalisations were
in the first 14 days; Appendix Figure A.2 shows the corresponding graph to 60 days, which show a
high hospitalisation rate over the first 14 days and an approximately constant low rate subsequently.

3.3 Mortality
There were 2,603 deaths within 28 days of positive test in the 592,409 SGTF patients (0.44%) and
899 deaths within 28 days in the 246,869 non-SGTF patients (0.36%). The crude HR of death was
1.22 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.31). After adjustment for all considered potential confounders the HR was
1.59 (95% CI 1.44 to 1.74).

4. Discussion
4.1 Principal findings
This retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients identified through community testing in England
indicated that the risk of hospitalisation within 14 days after a positive test was 1.52 (95% CI 1.47 to
1.57) times higher for diagnosed patients infected with the B.1.1.7 variant compared to patients
infected with wildtype variants, after adjustment for age, sex, deprivation, ethnicity, region and
week of diagnosis. Consistent with previously reported analyses of the study dataset,[6,7] the results
indicated that B.1.1.7 is associated with a 1.59 (95% CI 1.44 to 1.74) times higher risk of death within
28 days.

12

The results indicated that the higher risk of hospitalisation may apply primarily to adults above the
age of 30, and the risk was not found to be higher for SGTF compared to non-SGTF COVID-19
patients below the age of 20. This may reflect a similarly low risk of severe disease in younger and
less comorbid individuals as previously reported for wildtype variants.[20]
We have provided absolute risk estimates of hospitalisation within 14 days by age group after
adjustment for potential confounders. Under the model used to estimate the absolute risks, the
B.1.1.7 variant can be estimated to have caused an excess 8941 hospitalisations within 14 days
during the study period, based on a comparison of the observed hospitalisations with the expected
hospitalisations under a counterfactual scenario in which patients with SGTF variants were
hospitalised at the same rate as those with non-SGTF variants. However, this estimate ignores the
excess transmissibility of B.1.1.7 [2,4,5] and hence likely underestimate the total number of
hospitalisations attributable to B.1.1.7.
4.2 Strengths and limitations of the study
Strengths of this analysis include the use of the community-based dataset, which includes all COVID19 patients identified through community testing in England. The large dataset allowed for the use
of stratification to adjust for confounding due to individual-level demographic and socioeconomic
factors, region and calendar period.
Although the observed increased risks of hospitalisation and mortality are both consistent with the
hypothesis of increased severity for B.1.1.7 compared to wildtype SARS-CoV-2, hospitalisation may
not be susceptible to the same confounding pathways as mortality. The calendar period in which the
prevalence of the B.1.1.7 increased coincided with a general increase of COVID-19 diagnoses in the
UK,[21] and initial outbreaks of B.1.1.7 were local to South East England and neighbouring
regions.[5] It is possible that a high local pressure on the healthcare system might lead to higher
mortality because of factors such as insufficient resources and staff per hospital-admitted patient.
Hence, because the pressure on the healthcare system was higher in areas where B.1.1.7 was more
prevalent, it is possible that those areas saw a somewhat higher mortality due to hospital overburden. This could result in positive confounding, i.e. the mortality risk associated with B.1.1.7 may
have been somewhat overestimated in this and previous analyses of community testing data in
England.[6,7] In this and previous studies, hospital pressure was not directly adjusted for, and the
potential confounding effect of local hospital pressure was only addressed indirectly through
adjustment for time period and region.[6–8] In contrast, high local hospital pressure is not
associated with the propensity that newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients experience disease
sufficiently severe to require hospitalisation, and is unlikely to lead to a greater proportion of COVID19 patients requiring hospital care being admitted to hospital. Hence, hospital pressure is unlikely to
positively confound the association between SGTF status and hospital admission. Most likely,
hospital pressure does not affect the propensity that a severely affected COVID-19 patient is
admitted to hospital. If so, hospital pressure does not confound the association between SGTF status
and hospitalisation. However, it is possible that due to severe local hospital over-burden, some
severely affected COVID-19 patients who would otherwise have been hospitalised were not
admitted, or admitted later than they otherwise would. Because of the time-and-region-specific
overlap between high hospital pressure and high prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant, this would
however be expected to result in negative confounding and hence underestimation of the
hospitalisation HR for B.1.1.7-infected patients. In the absence of full control for the potential
confounding due to local hospital pressure in analyses of mortality risk, the association with

13

hospitalisation corroborates the hypothesis that the B.1.1.7 variant is associated with more severe
disease than wildtype variants.
Our study also has limitations. The study population included COVID-19 patients with known SGTF
status from three laboratories providing community testing. These laboratories perform a large
proportion of tests from across the country (41.0% of positive cases over the study period), but
geographic distribution can vary depending on capacity from other available laboratories. These
potential geographical differences in testing coverage were accounted for in the adjusted model.
The community-based population excluded COVID-19 patients who were diagnosed after
presentation directly to emergency or other healthcare services. Individuals who present directly to
healthcare services may have more severe disease than those diagnosed through community
testing. Community testing is largely self-selected, and we cannot control for the possibility that
testing patterns may have differed between individuals infected with the B.1.1.7 variant and
individuals infected with wildtype variants. Some evidence suggests that individuals infected with
the B.1.1.7 variant are more likely to experience symptomatic disease compared to other infected
individuals,[22] but it is unknown if the B.1.1.7 variant is also associated with more severe symptoms
in the subset who experience symptoms.
Our analysis is limited by a lack of data on comorbidity and obesity, which are risk factors for
hospitalisation with COVID-19.[20] Previous studies have however not noted any association
between B.1.1.7 status and BMI [9] or comorbidity [8,9] in COVID-19 patients. Hence, we do not
expect that these potential confounders were strongly associated with SGTF status. Furthermore,
they were accounted for indirectly through age, sex, ethnicity and deprivation. In light of the finding
that the hospitalisation risk for those infected with the B.1.1.7 variant increased with age, further
research is however needed to understand whether the severity associated with the B.1.1.7 variant
is modified by age, and associated factors such as comorbidity and obesity.
The analysis uses SGTF status which is a proxy test for the B.1.1.7 variant. However, any nondifferential misclassification is likely to result in a small bias towards the null, and the available
sequencing data indicate that the positive and negative predictive values of the SGTF test was >90%
during the studied period.[2]
Healthcare recommendations for COVID-19 patients did not differ by SARS-CoV-2 variant, but the
B.1.1.7 variant and the reports of its increased severity saw great media attention over the studied
period and it is possible that this might have affected the healthcare seeking behaviour of COVID-19
patients. However, the assessment of SGTF was done for surveillance purposes and the SGTF status
not routinely provided to patients or their healthcare providers, so we have no reason to believe
that healthcare-seeking behaviour differed by SGTF status. Consistently, we observed no significant
variation in the HR for SGTF compared to non-SGTF patients by calendar week.
Reporting delays might affect this analysis, particularly for the hospitalisation data from SUS which
are not recorded until after the completion of a hospital episode. However, at least 108 days had
elapsed between the patients’ dates of positive test and the linkage with the hospitalisation data,
which makes reporting delays likely to have had limited impact. Furthermore, the SGTF patients
were on average diagnosed later in calendar time than the non-SGTF patients. Hence, any
nondifferential underreporting of hospitalisations due to reporting delays may have resulted in
underestimation of the hospitalisation risk predominantly in the SGTF patients, which might have
resulted in a small underestimation of the true HR. Our analyses controlled for calendar week, which

14

likely makes the effect of this limited. Additionally, the use of hospitalisation data from health
service datasets that principally serve administrative purposes has the benefit of broad coverage.
The proportional hazards assumption of the Cox regression model was violated, but the
corresponding log-log plots indicated that the deviation from proportionality was very minor within
the first 14 days after the positive test. Consistently, when allowing for time-dependent effects the
time-varying HRs in the first 14 days were similar to the overall HR of hospitalisation within 1-14
days from the primary analysis. By contrast, the time-dependent HRs of hospitalisation 15-60 days
after the positive test from the additional analysis where we extended the follow-up time beyond 14
days were close to 1.0, and the hazards hence clearly non-proportional over this extended follow-up.
These patterns likely reflect that the hospitalisation data were limited by a lack of information on
the reason for admission and the analysis therefore based on hospitalisations due to any cause. Due
to the narrow time interval considered in the primary analysis of hospitalisations between 1-14 days
after a first positive SARS-CoV-2 test, most of these hospitalisations were likely due to COVID-19.
Assuming that the background rate of hospitalisation due to non-COVID-19 causes were similar
between SGTF and non-SGTF patients, the resulting non-differential misclassification of
hospitalisations due to other causes may however have resulted in a slight underestimation of the
cause-specific HR in days 1-14. Such misclassification is a likely explanation for the attenuation of the
HR when we extended the follow-up period to 60 days, because non-COVID-19 causes may
constitute a higher proportion of the reasons for the late hospitalisations.
4.3 Comparison with other studies
The estimated higher risk of hospitalisation is in line with a previous analysis that estimated a hazard
ratio of hospitalisation of 1.34 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.66), based on follow-up of COVID-19 patients with
sequencing-confirmed B.1.1.7 or wildtype SARS-CoV-2 in England.[13] That study observed only 120
hospitalisations in B.1.1.7-infected individuals which yielded a wide confidence interval. By contrast,
in the present study we observed 27,710 hospitalisations in patients with SGTF which allowed us to
provide higher precision estimates. The results are also consistent with a previous ecological analysis
that estimated a hospitalisation relative risk of 1.7 based on hospitalisation patterns by the regional
prevalence of SGTF variants in England,[11,12] and reported relative risks in the range 1.6—1.7
based on data from Scotland,[11] seven EU/EEA countries,[23] Denmark [24] and Canada.[10] This
adds to the evidence of higher severity COVID-19 after infection with B.1.1.7 compared to wildtype
SARS-CoV-2, as further indicated by its association with higher risk of intensive care admission
[9,10,23] and death.[6–10]
Our finding of lower age-specific HR estimates in younger age groups are consistent with a
previously reported age-specific adjusted odds ratio of hospitalisation of 1.0 for SGTF versus nonSGTF patients aged 0-19 in seven EU/EEA countries,[23] but contrasts with a study in Denmark which
reported an adjusted odds ratio of 1.84 for SGTF patients aged 0-29.[24] Children and adolescents
aged ≤18 who were hospitalised with COVID-19 in November 2020-January 2021 at King's College
Hospital in London (where the local prevalence of B.1.1.7 was high) were reported to have had
similar clinical severity and treatment requirements compared to those hospitalised in March-May
2020,[25] corroborating the suggestion that individuals in the youngest age groups experience no
more severe disease if infected with B.1.1.7 compared to wildtype SARS-CoV-2.

15

4.4 Conclusions
The results from this large nationwide community testing cohort suggest that the risk of
hospitalisation is higher for COVID-19 patients infected with the B.1.1.7 variant compared to
wildtype variants, likely reflecting that the variant is associated with more severe disease. This
higher severity may however be specific to adults above the age of 30, and further research is
needed to identify if the severity is modified by factors associated with ageing. Taken together with
the previous evidence of increased mortality and transmissibility, the results suggest that epidemics
of the B.1.1.7 variant are likely to result in higher burden on the healthcare system in unvaccinated
populations compared to epidemics of wildtype SARS-CoV-2.

Appendix Table A.1. Number of hospitalisations and number of observations that were informative,
and the corresponding hazard ratios of hospitalisation within 1-14 days for SGTF compared to nonSGTF patients, for the fully stratified “base model”, and for corresponding reduced models with each
stratification covariate excluded one-by-one. The hazard ratios were estimated stratified by the
adjustment covariates 10-year age group, sex, ethnicity, IMD quintile, region of residence, and/or
week of specimen; and using regression adjustment for the quantitative covariates age, IMD rank,
and/or date of specimen.
