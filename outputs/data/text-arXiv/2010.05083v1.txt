Abstract
The current outbreak of COVID-19 has called renewed attention to the need for sound statistical
analysis for monitoring mortality patterns and trends over time. Excess mortality has been suggested as the most appropriate indicator to measure the overall burden of the pandemic on mortality. As such, excess mortality has received considerable interest during the first months of
the COVID-19 pandemic.
Previous approaches to estimate excess mortality are somewhat limited, as they do not include
sufficiently long-term trends, correlations among different demographic and geographic
groups, and the autocorrelations in the mortality time series. This might lead to biased estimates
of excess mortality, as random mortality fluctuations may be misinterpreted as excess mortality.
We present a blend of classical epidemiological approaches to estimating excess mortality during extraordinary events with an established demographic approach in mortality forecasting,
namely a Lee-Carter type model, which covers the named limitations and draws a more realistic
picture of the excess mortality. We illustrate our approach using weekly age- and sex-specific
mortality data for 19 countries and the current COVID-19 pandemic as a case study. Our proposed model provides a general framework that can be applied to future pandemics as well as
to monitor excess mortality from specific causes of deaths.

1. Introduction
The current outbreak of COVID-19 has highlighted the need for sound and timely statistical
analysis and monitoring of mortality patterns and trends. On many occasions, excess mortality
– the number of deaths above expectation in the absence of exceptional events, e.g., a pandemic,
an exceptional influenza season, or a heatwave – is considered the most appropriate indicator
to measure the overall burden of the pandemic on mortality (National Academies of Sciences
& Medicine, 2020). As such, excess mortality due to COVID-19 has received considerable
attention during the last few months, including major outlets tracking this indicator across countries (see, e.g., The Economist, 2020). The computation of this measure should be based on
long time series of weekly or monthly mortality data, and the COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated the demand for timely release and publication of such data by national authorities (Leon
et al., 2020). While aggregate all-cause mortality data are being increasingly released, timely
reporting of cause-specific data by demographic subgroups is still underdeveloped. However,
such information would allow for near real-time assessment of excess mortality caused by a
specific disease. Moreover, widespread statistical approaches for estimating excess mortality
have been rather simplistic thus far, as they rely on rather basic statistical measures, which do
not include stochasticity or the full dimension of the mortality development into account. Strong
correlations in mortality trends exist among not only different demographic groups, but also
among adjacent countries (Vanella, 2017); the underlying factors driving mortality reductions,
such as advances in medical care and hygiene, reach all of these groups to some extent (Vanella
& Deschermeier, 2020). Therefore, a holistic approach for excess mortality assessment should
analyze the multitude of demographic and geographic groups simultaneously. Furthermore, rather short time series are generally considered in the computation of excess mortality, which
cannot sufficiently capture eventual long-term trends.

3

In this article, we propose a stochastic framework for estimating excess mortality based on a
Lee-Carter modeling approach. We develop a comprehensive model that can take into account
the multidimensionality (and eventual collinearity) of the data analyzed, which consists of several long-term time series for 19 different countries, both sexes and four age groups. This allows
us to consider the long-term mortality trends present in the data. Finally, the model can produce
probabilistic statements concerning the excess mortality that occurs during a particular event.
Whereas our case study is on the current COVID-19 pandemic, our method provides a general
framework for future outbreaks of other pathogens, as well as other major events influencing
mortality on a larger demographic and/or geographic scale.
The following section provides a literature review starting with current approaches of excess
mortality estimation in general and specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Then we give
an overview of stochastic mortality models, which address multiple populations in parallel. The
latter gives a theoretical basis for our multidimensional mortality forecast model which is presented in Section 3. Based on this, a stochastic investigation of excess mortality during the
COVID-19 pandemic by country and demographics is conducted, whose results are presented
in Section 4. These results are then discussed, alongside their implications for mortality forecasting. We finally draw conclusions from our findings and give an outlook on further need for
developments in excess mortality evaluation and mortality forecasting.

2. Literature Review
2.1 Assessment of Excess Mortality and Estimates for COVID-19
Estimation of excess mortality goes back to studies on influenza and pneumonia by Collins et
al. for the United States (Collins, 1932; Collins, Frost, Gover, & Sydenstricker, 1930). The
4

authors calculated weekly expected death rates due to influenza, pneumonia, and other causes
for the whole population5 as the median of a seven-year baseline period. These were then compared to the observed death rates due to these causes during a certain period of an epidemic.
Positive differences between the observed and the expected mortality rates were then defined
as excess mortality. Serfling extended this approach by fitting parametric Fourier (i.e. trigonometric) models to death rate time series separately by age groups and by selected causes of
death6 for estimating monthly excess mortality (Serfling, 1963). Housworth and Langmuir proposed a stochastic extension of Serfling's approach, assuming that the residuals between observed and expected death rates follow a t distribution (Housworth & Langmuir, 1974). Foppa
and Hossain proposed a Bayesian extension of that model for excess death numbers due to
influenza (Foppa & Hossain, 2008).
Some approaches have been proposed to estimate excess mortality due to COVID-19 during
the pandemic. We present some already published results in the form of scientific publications
and official reports here.
Magnani et al. estimated expected mortality rates and daily death numbers for Italian regions
from January 1st to April 15th, 2020 by averaging the daily mortality rates for the years 20152019. Assuming that death counts follow a Poisson distribution, they also estimated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the daily death numbers, separately for age groups below 60 years
and 60 years and above. They derived a statistically significant excess mortality in Italy due to
COVID-19 since March 7th until the end of the study period, estimating 45,032 mean excess
deaths, a figure that is more than double the death numbers attributed to COVID-19 (Magnani,
Azzolina, Gallo, Ferrante, & Gregori, 2020). Michelozzi et al. further showed that this excess
mortality was concentrated in the north of Italy, which has been hit harder by the pandemic than

the center and the south of the country, and that excess mortality is more accentuated for men
and the elderly (Michelozzi et al., 2020).
The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) COVID-19 Response team used the regression model of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) based on the years 2015-2019 to estimate expected deaths. Overall deaths above that
margin were defined as excess deaths. This surveillance system is normally applied to estimate
excess deaths because of influenza (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019), but it
was further used to estimate excess deaths due to COVID-19 in New York City between March
11th and May 2nd, 2020. The authors identified over 24 thousand excess deaths over the observed
period, from which close to 14 thousand were laboratory-confirmed COVID deaths, while other
5 thousand were probably associated with COVID-19 (New York City Department of Health
and Mental Hygiene Covid-19 Response Team, 2020).
EUROMOMO concurrently offers excess mortality estimates based on a fit Generalized Linear
Model (GLM) by age groups for 23 European countries. The model is fitted to a maximum of
the previous five years of data. The graphs reported by EUROMOMO show a general pattern
of excess mortality in Europe since April 2020 for individuals aged 15 and older (Statens Serum
Institut, 2020a, 2020b).
These approaches do not include correlations in mortality rates among age groups and/or among
countries. Our proposed approach aims at overcoming these limitations employing a demographic perspective. Appendix C provides a summary comparison of the presented approaches
and results including ours.

2.2 Multi-Population Stochastic Mortality Forecasting
There is a large amount of literature on mortality forecasting approaches. As it is not our intention to give a full literature review here, the interested readers are referred to, e.g., the compilation by Janssen (Janssen, 2018). We will restrict our review to those approaches we believe
are important in this context, which are stochastic models that include age-specific mortality
and multiple populations.
One forecast approach of major importance is based on principal components (PCs). A PC is a
linear combination of a group of variables, in our context age-specific mortality rates. The PCs
are derived by singular value decomposition. The method has two major advantages. First,
highly dimensional phenomena, such as mortality rates among age groups, sex, and countries,
can be analyzed relatively efficiently. Second, correlations among different variables, such as
age- and sex-specific mortality rates are included in the analysis, which is very important in
forecasting to quantify the uncertainty of the mortality forecast adequately. An illustrative explanation of the method applied to age- and sex-specific survival rates is given, e.g., by Vanella
(Vanella, 2018). The application of principal component analysis (PCA) to age-specific mortality rates goes back to Ledermann and Breas (Ledermann & Breas, 1959), who used it for
transforming French data to derive common mortality trends. Le Bras and Tapinos (Le Bras &
Tapinos, 1979) proposed using PCA to project mortality in France. Bell and Monsell (Bell &
Monsell, 1991) extended this framework by including autocorrelations of the PCs employing
autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models7 for mortality forecasting in the
US. Lee and Carter (Lee & Carter, 1992) identified the first PC in that model as a general
mortality index, which covers the vast majority of mortality trends observed over all age groups,

7

See Box, Jenkins, Reinsel, & Ljung, 2016 or Shumway & Stoffer, 2016 for detailed presentations of ARIMA
models.

7

and proposed a random walk with drift model to forecast the index, which can then be retransformed to derive forecast mortality rates. Tuljapurkar et al. (Tuljapurkar, Li, & Boe, 2000)
qualitatively showed that there were large correlations in mortality trends among the G7 countries, which could be covered well by the Lee-Carter model. Booth et al. (Booth, Maindonald,
& Smith, 2002) proposed a graphical method for determining the optimal baseline period to
inform the model. A too-short baseline assumes the long-term future trends to follow the near
past, which appears unrealistic. On the other hand, very long past data may not apply to future
trends, especially in the shorter term. Whereas the mortality index is modeled as a linear process, Brouhns et al. (Brouhns, Denuit, & Vermunt, 2002) proposed a GLM version of the LeeCarter model. The classical Lee-Carter model assumes independence between mortality of females and males, which can be rejected (see, e.g., Vanella, 2017, on the correlation of mortality
among both sexes). Li and Lee (Li & Lee, 2005) therefore proposed an extension, the so-called
common factor model, which includes the international correlations and the correlations between the two sexes in the mortality trends to some degree in the analysis. Renshaw and Haberman (Renshaw & Haberman, 2006) enhanced the classical Lee-Carter model by including
cohort effects in the model. Hyndman and Ullah (Hyndman & Ullah, 2007) proposed a nonparametric extension of the Lee-Carter model. Russolillo et al. (Russolillo, Giordano, &
Haberman, 2011) proposed extending the Lee-Carter model by applying a Three-Mode PCA to
include international correlations in the model. However, they ignored sex-specific differences
in their model. Vanella (Vanella, 2017) proposed a simulation approach, which similarly forecasts age- and sex-specific survival rates for 18 European countries, therefore taking correlations in mortality trends among age groups, both sexes and countries into account via PCA,
extrapolating long-term trends in the PC time series parametrically and considering stochasticity by Monte Carlo simulation of ARIMA models. The author showed an efficient way to include common international trends in mortality in one model, as PCA can cover the majority of
the trends, which different countries witness simultaneously. We will use a derivation of that
8

approach for our analysis. Finally, Bergeron-Boucher et al. (Bergeron-Boucher, CanudasRomo, Oeppen, & Vaupel, 2017) proposed a modification of the Li-Lee model by leveraging
age-at-death distributions and compositional data analysis to produce coherent forecasts for 15
Western European countries.
We see that, with a few exceptions, works on mortality forecasting focused on a national level.
In some cases, international or even global mortality forecasts are of interest. Separate forecasts
would not only be unfeasible, but would also ignore common trends among the countries. Some
authors have conducted stochastic projections of groups of countries or on a global scale using
Bayesian approaches, which assume an a priori distribution for some parameter or variable
either based on auxiliary data or subjective assumptions (Kruschke, 2015; Lynch, 2007). To
capture the major problem of the Lee-Carter model of systematically underestimating the uncertainty in the mortality forecast, Pedroza (Pedroza, 2006) proposed a Bayesian extension of
the classical Lee-Carter model, which includes the uncertainty of all parameters using Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. King and Soneji (King & Soneji, 2011) suggested
considering assumptions on trends in smoking behavior and obesity in projections of age-specific mortality rates through a Bayesian Hierarchical model for the US. Raftery et al. (Raftery,
Chunn, Gerland, & Ševčíková, 2013) proposed a Bayesian Hierarchical model for joint probabilistic projections of international male life expectancies by cohort using time series data on
life expectancy in combination with judgmental projection data by national experts. The identified distributions are then simulated by MCMC to derive empirical projection intervals for the
countries under study. The approach was then expanded for females by simulating the gender
gap in life expectancy by regression analysis of the international data (Raftery, Lalić, &
Gerland, 2014). The Raftery model is the basis of the life expectancy projections of the United
Nations. From these projections, they derive age- and sex-specific mortality rates for all countries with three different techniques, depending on the quality of the mortality data available for
9

the countries (United Nations, 2019). Antonio et al. (Antonio, Bardoutsos, & Ouburg, 2015)
give a Bayesian version of the Lee-Carter model which allows for joint mortality projections
among various countries.

3. Data and Methods
3.1 Data
We extracted recently published estimates of weekly mortality rates by sex and age groups
below 15 years, 15 to 64 years, 65 to 74 years, 75 to 84 years, and aged 85 and above, provided
by the Short-term Mortality Fluctuations data series of the Human Mortality Database (HMD)
(Human Mortality Database, 2020). The data give 52 weekly estimates of mortality rates for a
series of calendar years, starting from different country-specific time points. We select all countries with available data since the start of the year 20008. We take the data for the whole period
week 2, 20009 to week 52, 2019 on Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary, Israel,
Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Scotland, Slovakia, Slovenia,
Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, for which data are available and the population and death
numbers are sufficiently high to derive representative estimates of weekly mortality. To avoid
zero values in the data, we aggregate the age groups below 15 and 15-64 years in a single group.
We compute mortality rates in this wider group using aggregated deaths and exposures extracted from the HMD. Finally, we arrange the data in a 1,039x152 matrix10 of time series of
weekly age-, sex-, and country-specific mortality rates (WASCSMRs). In Appendix A, we
report all the country-sex and age-specific combinations analyzed in our paper. For the last step

allow for derivation of representative weekly estimates.

of our analysis, we use daily reported data on COVID-19 associated deaths by country, provided
by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) (European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control, 2020).

3.2 Methods
We follow Vanella (2017), which was presented in 2.2. We make sure that later simulations of
mortality rates cannot exceed the range (0; 1). This is achieved by using the logistic transformation of the WASCSMRs (Vanella, 2017). We first perform PCA on the logit-WASCSMR
time series. Figure 1 illustrates the loadings of the first PC (PC1). The loadings are basically
correlations between the PCs and the original variables (Vanella, 2018), in this case, the logitWASCSMRs.
Figure 1. Loadings of Principal Component 1

11

The loadings of PC1 are strictly negative, implying a negative correlation with all mortality
rates. Thus, increases in PC1 ceteris paribus are associated with decreases in all WASCSMR
under study. PC1 is hence a classical Lee-Carter Mortality Index (Lee & Carter, 1992), explaining 55% of the overall variance in the 152 time series. Therefore, we will address it as LeeCarter Index for the remainder of the paper. Furthermore, it is interesting to observe that the
loadings for the younger age group (i.e. 00-64 years) are almost always smaller in absolute
value than those for older groups. As such, increases in PC1 generally lead to greater mortality
reductions at older rather than younger ages. Figure 2 shows the time series of PC1 from 2000
to 2019. The vertical lines indicate week 1 of each year.

The curve has a highly seasonal pattern, with strongly increasing mortality (i.e. lower values of
PC1) in the winter season and decreasing mortality in summer (i.e. higher values of PC1). The
general trend is increasing, which is analog to decreasing mortality trends, but concave, which
means that mortality improvements have a diminishing trend. To capture these different features of time series, we iteratively fit a variety of models to the curve, which are then compared
via Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Table
1 gives the results of this range of model fits.

The cosine term represents the baseline seasonality of the year, similar to the Serfling-approach,
with 𝑤 = 0 being calendar week 31, 2000. This choice of origin leads to the maximization of
the 𝑅², indicating the best fit to the observed seasonality. We checked the full Fourier model as
well, but discarded the sine term, as it does not lead to any improvement in the model fit, while
worsening the efficiency of the model, represented by higher values of the information criteria.
The second variable is an inverse logistic growth function, which can be used to simulate a
growth function, similar to the implementation in (Vanella, 2017; Vanella & Deschermeier,
2018, 2019) with 𝑤 being the week and 𝑡0 being a parameter to be estimated iteratively to
maximize the model’s 𝑅². 𝛽 is a parameter, which is computed by Maximum Likelihood Estimation. Spring, Summer, and Autumn are binary variables, which are 1 during the respective
seasons and 0 otherwise. Winter is therefore the baseline season. For instance, Spring is from
calendar week 13 to 25, Summer from calendar week 26 to 38, and so on. Following Occam’s
Razor, a simple model should be preferred to a more complex one, if it performs similarly well
(Bijak, 2011). A model is most efficient if it minimizes the information criteria. We see that the
inclusion of an inverse logistic growth function increases the quality of the model substantially,
as it leads not only to a huge increase in the 𝑅² from 30.4 to 91,5%, but also to a large decrease
in both the AIC and the BIC. Therefore, the fit of the model to the data increases significantly,
while leading to a more efficient model as well. However, this long-term trend is generally not
considered in models of excess mortality, as explained in Section 2.1. An extension of the model
by seasonal dummies leads to further significant improvements of the fit, as the trigonometric
function systematically underestimates the mortality peaks in winter, while overestimating the
values in summer. Model 1.3 fits the data well with an 𝑅² of almost 93%. Both information
criteria favor this model as well. The coefficients of the seasonal dummies should not be taken
for concrete interpretations, however. They simply serve as correction factors to systematic
under/over-estimation of the Fourier series. The unexplained share is modeled by fitting a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model, which is chosen by a series
14

of tests following (Vanella, 2018). Figure 3 illustrates the model fit (continuous line) to the data
(dots).

The Lee-Carter Index can serve as a summary indicator of overall mortality, as it captures the
main trends in mortality. The loadings of the remaining PCs do not deem as straightforward

16

interpretations and will be assumed random walk processes11. Following Vanella (Vanella,
2017), we assume them to follow a random walk process, as our tests show that random walk
models perform reasonably well reproducing the series. As the Lee-Carter Index covers general
trends in mortality among age groups, sexes, and countries (Lee & Carter, 1992; Vanella, 2017),
a comparison of the forecast of its development in 2020 to its observations can give us a general
assessment of excess mortality over different groups by week. For this, we multiply the loadings
from Figure 1 with the HMD estimates of the WASCSMR in weeks 1-13, 2020 for the study
countries, thereby deriving hypothetical observations of the Lee-Carter Index, keeping the loadings derived from the baseline data fixed:
̂ 1 (𝜏) = ∑152
𝑃𝐶
𝑖=1 𝜆𝑖 𝑀𝑖,𝜏 , 𝜏 = 1,2, … . ,13,
With


𝜆𝑖 being the loading of the ith WASCSMR on the Lee-Carter Index,



𝑀𝑖,𝜏 being the HMD estimate of the ith logit-WASCSMR for week 𝜏.

This will allow a direct comparison between the course of the PC and its expectation based on
the time series data. The results of this approach will be presented in Section 4.
We then use Monte Carlo simulation for each PC to simulate 10,000 trajectories of the weekly
development of all PCs for the year 2020. Since the PCs are uncorrelated (Vanella, 2018), independent simulation of their future paths does not lead to biased estimation of the mortality
rates, which are then derived from these. The results are 10,000 trajectories of each PC, which
can be retransformed into weekly trajectories of the logit-WASCSMR. For instance, let 𝚷𝑡 be

11

E.g., PC2 covers cohort shifts within the age groups. For long-term forecasts, the PC should therefore be modeled more detailed. Within the scope of our paper, which is the investigation of short-term fluctuations in mortality, the random walk assumption is sufficient.

the simulation matrix of all PCs (10,000x152) in period 𝑡. The corresponding simulation matrix
of the logit-WASCSMRs is then
−𝟏
𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡(𝑨𝒕 ) = ∑152
𝑖=1 𝚷𝑡 𝚲 ,

with 𝚲−𝟏 being the inverse of the loadings matrix resulting from the singular value decomposition. In the next step, we derive the trajectories of the WASCSMRs by taking the inverse logistic transform of 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡(𝑨𝒕 ), namely 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡 −1 [𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡(𝑨𝒕 )] = 𝑨𝒕 .
The distribution of the difference between the observed WASCSMR and the respective forecasts can then give a probabilistic statement about the actual degree of excess mortality we have
observed during a certain period.
The last part of the analysis compares our weekly estimates of excess mortality with the official
reported COVID-19 attributed deaths to assess differences between the two data sources. For
this, we compute excess mortality numbers between calendar weeks 1 and 25, 2000 – i.e. during
the outbreak of COVID-19.

4. Results
Figure 5 illustrates the course of the Lee-Carter Index since the beginning of 2019 and its forecast for the first 13 weeks of 2020 with 95% PIs as described in Section 3. Moreover, the dotted
red line gives the hypothetical course under the loadings derived from the 2000-2019 data.

18

Figure 5. Forecast of Lee-Carter Index for Weeks 1-13, 2020 with 95% PIs and Actual Course

The mortality development oscillates around its mean forecast up to week 10, i.e. the first week
of March 2020. After that, it leaves that course and sharply decreases. In week 13, it even falls
below the lower bound of the 95% PI. Thus, the international mortality level at this point is
statistically significantly higher than the realistic trends which are derived from the previous 20
years of data.
Retransforming the PC forecast to forecasts of the WASCSMRs and multiplying those with the
population estimates from the HMD, we derive weekly estimates of death numbers for all subgroups, which allow for comparison of the observed with the expected mortality level in absolute numbers.

Both sexes and all age groups show a peak in the death numbers between weeks 12 and 17 of
2020. However, a more detailed analysis shows increases beyond the upper limits of the 95%
PIs only for the very old age groups. For persons aged 75 and above, we observe a significant
increase in mortality for weeks 13-16. For the age group 65-74, the increase is statistically

22

significant for males only. Mortality increases for persons below age 65 since the COVID-19
crisis are not statistically significant for both sexes.

Finally, we investigate how our results relate to official data on COVID-19 associated deaths.
Figure 12 illustrates the weekly excess mortality numbers for the 18 study countries from Figure
6, derived from our simulations with 75% and 95% PIs, alongside the official COVID-19 associated deaths, as provided by the ECDC. The bottom panel shows the difference between the
excess mortality estimates and the COVID-19 deaths.

Study Countries

After subtracting the COVID-19 deaths, there is no significant deviation from the expected
death numbers until calendar week 12. Excess mortality in calendar weeks 13 and 14 shows
slight tendencies to be augmented even after adjustment to the COVID-19 numbers. After induction of COVID-19 countermeasures, COVID-19 adjusted mortality temporarily was statistically significantly below expectation.

5. Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic has influenced mortality patterns and trends across the world during
the first half of 2020. Similar to other analyses (Magnani et al., 2020; Michelozzi et al., 2020;
Statens Serum Institut, 2020a), we confirm clear excess mortality in several of those countries
with strong infection dynamics during the first half of 2020. Our estimate is however more
precise and shows the uncertainty around these estimates based both on the demography of
countries as well as long-term mortality trends. Previous approaches do not include the stochasticity in their prediction sufficiently, as they neither consider autocorrelations of the mortality time series (be it death numbers or death rates) nor the cross-correlations among the mortality series in their models, as Appendix C shows. Moreover, some models do not consider the
long-term trends in mortality at all, as they simply take the average values of the previous years.
Others include the trending behavior, but only for the last four or five years, which does not
cover the long-term trending of mortality sufficiently, as we observe decreasing mortality trends
in developed countries since at least the early 1970s (Vanella, 2017). The previous approaches
to excess mortality estimation therefore systematically underestimate future risk. Forecasts are
less certain with increasing distance between the time the forecast was conducted and the time
for which the forecast is conducted. This phenomenon is represented by increasing widths of
the PIs (e.g., Box et al., 2016; Vanella & Deschermeier, 2020). The literature on excess mortality instead shows constant widths of the intervals. Moreover, not all approaches appear to
perform well in the winter season. Statens Serum Institut, 2020a, for instance, shows significant
excess mortality in all winter seasons. As excess mortality is the difference between observed
and expected deaths, the forecast seems to be systematically misspecified for winter. Our model
tries to account for these limitations of previous approaches and can, due to its international
perspective, be well implemented for a multi-population analysis of excess mortality.

27

As the magnitude of our results does not permit us to report everything which could be derived
from our model, we restrict the results to one dimension at a time (either demographics or geography by week). Indeed, we derive simulation results for all 152 variables. To illustrate the
depth of our analysis, we add the detailed results for all age groups in Spain as an example in
Appendix B, since Spain is one of the larger countries in Europe and has witnessed significant
mortality due to COVID-19. Moreover, the Spanish COVID-19 data and surveillance are of a
relatively high quality.
Our results show that there appears to be a general excess mortality caused by the COVID-19
pandemic, which however affects different age groups and countries heterogeneously. As our
study was limited to the countries with sufficiently long time series data, other countries affected strongly by the pandemic, such as Italy, are missing, which limits our conclusions to the
countries analyzed here. The excess mortality quantified here is not representative globally. The
regional variation is at least partly explained by differing courses of the epidemic as well as
different non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) taken nationally or regionally during the
study period (Ritchie et al., 2020). Thus it is difficult to quantify the actual attribution of
COVID-19 infections on the overall population mortality risk (Chaudry, Dranitsaris, Mubashir,
Bartoszko, & Riazi, 2020; Hadjidemetriou, Sasidharan, Kouyialis, & Parlikad, 2020). The mortality due to a specific disease can be addressed by the case fatality risk (CFR) – the risk of
death after infection – which, however, is quite vulnerable to bias in outbreaks (Lipsitch et al.,
2015). The international CFR estimates for COVID-19 are biased due to demographic characteristics of the cases, time lags between reporting of cases and deaths, and capacities of national
healthcare systems, among other unobservable factors. Therefore, assessing international differences in mortality due to this disease without accounting for these characteristics and factors
is inadvisable (Backhaus, 2020; Dudel et al., 2020; Vanella et al., 2020).

28

The classical Lee-Carter model and its extensions, which usually perform exceptionally well in
mortality forecasting, might not be applicable in their pure form for the near future, as the longterm overall effect of COVID-19 on the age-specific mortality pattern and its summary
measures – such as life expectancy at birth and lifespan inequality – is yet unobserved. Moreover, it is unknown when vaccines will be available to the wide public and how well the vaccines
will perform in terms of their effectiveness (Gallagher, 2020). It is highly improbable that the
effectiveness of any vaccine will lie at 100% (Folegatti et al., 2020; Lovelace & Higgins-Dunn,
2020), therefore mortality trends derived from the historical mortality data might not be completely representative for the future. As we have not witnessed a similar pandemic in the near
past, an adjustment factor to classical Lee-Carter models could be appropriate, transferring them
to Bayesian models. The additional information, i.e. the mortality change due to COVID-19, is
difficult to assess, however, as the CFRs are biased, as it has been discussed, and the actual
prevalence of the disease among the population is unknown. Many cases, who witness only
mild symptoms or are completely asymptomatic (Istituto Superiore di Sanità, 2020), will not
be detected (Mizumoto, Kagaya, Zarebski, & Chowell, 2020). Moreover, the prevalence estimates are potentially influenced due to a variation of the COVID-19 countermeasures introduced by the different countries and even sub-national geographical units. Taking, e.g., the
number of deaths in Spain, illustrated in Figure 9, we observe sharp mortality decreases after
the peak in week 13, i.e. the last week of March. In mid-March, Spain introduced national
countermeasures to contain the spread of the virus (Hogan Lovells Solutions, 2020), which
presumably lead to the mortality decrease after calendar week 13, taking the time lag between
an infection and the death of said person of up to two weeks into account (Vanella et al., 2020).
As we lack an experimental environment for individual measures, which would be needed for
estimating their effect on the virus spread and the mortality, the magnitude of deaths prevented
by the countermeasures cannot be quantified. Our stochastic investigation illustrates the poten-

29

tial influence of pure stochasticity on the observed death numbers, which shows that a deterministic inspection of reported death numbers does not give a reliable estimate of the impact of
COVID-19 countermeasures, but simply a qualitative orientation. Therefore, the available data
does not allow estimation of the mortality level under "normal circumstances", i.e. if we had no
active contact reduction measures. Our COVID-19 adjusted estimates have shown, however,
that excess mortality in calendar weeks 13 and 14 was exceptionally high, even after taking
reported COVID-19 deaths into account. This may be associated either with contemporaneous
external factors not associated to the pandemic, to indirect mortality effects of the pandemic,
such as surplus mortality through causes due to worse reduced healthcare capacities in overwhelmed healthcare systems (Roberton et al., 2020), or due to bias in the COVID-19 death
numbers (Backhaus, 2020) during that time. After the installment of COVID-19 countermeasures in the study countries, our COVID-19 adjusted excess mortality estimates have temporarily
been significantly negative. The cause of this is unknown, however direct effects of NPIs on
other infectious diseases (including influenza) as well as indirect effects lowering disease burden from other death causes, such as air pollution (Contini & Costabile, 2020) or accidents
(Shilling & Waetjen, 2020), is possible. Only cause-specific mortality estimates, including excess mortality, would shine light on these effects – however, the majority of countries included
here do not provide death causes in a sufficiently timely manner to allow this. In principle,
however, the model presented here would allow stratification by death cause.
An experimental approach might adjust the mortality data to the prevalence rates of active cases
among the population. As these are not available for all countries in a similar measure, i.e. in
coherent demographic groups (Dudel et al., 2020), well-thought methods for adjusting the available data need to be applied. Adjusting using simulations derived from population-based sero-

30

prevalence studies might be one solution. As this appears to exceed the scope of our investigation, we will not elaborate on that further in this paper. Further studies could consider this,
however, for mortality forecasting.

6. Conclusions and Outlook
Excess mortality during an epidemic is commonly computed using comparisons of observed
death numbers or death rates to predictions of these. Based on an extension of the Lee-Carter
mortality model (Lee & Carter, 1992; Vanella, 2017), we introduced a framework for including
not only the mentioned autocorrelations of the mortality time series and cross-correlations
among the mortality time series into the analysis, but also take long-term trends in the time
series into account. We have considered these points in our model by use of a combination of
PCA, SARIMA models, and classical time series analysis. Especially the inclusion of international mortality correlations in the model appears to be a crucial aspect in times of pandemics
due to the spread of the pathogen over international borders. We have covered the common
mortality trends induced by the spread of the virus within our PCA. Moreover, our approach
gives an efficient way to conduct multi-population studies on mortality developments. We have
illustrated how methods, which are established in demographic forecasting, can enrich the common epidemiological approaches employed in excess mortality studies. Our results identified
significant differences in excess mortality among different sub-populations and countries,
which could be investigated further.
Our application has illustrated the power of timely and detailed surveillance data on mortality
trends in informing health politics in time and provide scientific support for decision-making.

31

In addition to the case of all-cause mortality covered in this article, our approach could be applied to cause-specific mortality data. This would provide additional insights on mortality patterns related to specific diseases, regardless of the outbreak of an epidemic.

Appendix B. Detailed Model Results for Spain
Here, we show the complete results for one of the countries analyzed in our study. Figures 13
and 14 show the observed and predicted number of deaths by age groups and sex in Spain for
the weeks 1-30 in 2020. A statistically significant excess mortality is observable in all panels.
