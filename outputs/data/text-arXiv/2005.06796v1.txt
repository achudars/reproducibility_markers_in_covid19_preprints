Abstract
We measure public concern in Italy, Germany, France, Great Britain, Spain and the
United States during the outbreak of COVID-19 using three search-engine data sources
from Google Trends: YouTube, Google News and Google Search. We find that the dynamic
of public concern in Italy is a driver of that in other countries. Among the Google trends
series, we document that the Italian index is more relevant than the others in explaining
stock index returns for all countries. Finally, we perform a time-varying analysis and
observe that the most severe impacts on the financial markets occur at each step of the
Italian lock-down process.

Introduction

Google Trends (GT) provides indices based on the relative web-search volumes of a specific topic
over time. These indices can be retrieved for selected geographic areas or at the worldwide scale.
The interpretation of GT indices is straightforward: the higher the value of a given GT index,
the greater the public attention for that topic. In recent years, the informational content of
Google Trends data has shown to have explanatory and forecasting power in several fields of
economics and finance. In relation to financial markets, GT indices based on stock-related
terms: (i) lead to a higher portfolio diversification with respect to the market benchmark
[9], and (ii) can be used as sentiments [5] and early warning market signals [2, 4]. On the
macroeconomic side, GT indices have been used to construct economic uncertainty indicators
able to explain several macroeconomic variables [6, 3, 7]. GT data has also been successfully
used for disease surveillance purposes for MERS [11], Chicken-Pox [1] and Flu [12].
In this paper, we retrieve GT country indices (GT-COVID-19) for the coronavirus topic
from January 2020 to April 2020. We use them as proxies for country-level public concern
and investigate their impact on the financial markets during the outbreak of the coronavirus
disease. The COVID-19 pandemic is an interesting case to investigate since, due to its virulence

and infectivity, it represents a major exogenous shock to the economic and financial system,
which could not have been reasonably foreseen. In our analysis, we consider the six most
impacted countries worldwide in terms of confirmed cases, as of May the 1st 2020: the United
States, Spain, Italy, Great Britain, Germany and France. Our findings are three-fold. First,
the GT-COVID-19 index for Italy is found to be a driver of the GT indices for all the countries
considered. This lead-lag relationship is primarily due to the fact that Italy has been the
first European country to experience an outbreak of COVID-19 and to implement lock-down
measures since World War II. In addition, several European governments have introduced travel
restrictions from and to Italy during the first weeks of the outbreak. The ensuing spread of
the coronavirus disease in other countries provided a similar dynamic on the new cases and
for the implemented lock-down measures. Therefore, the delayed reaction of those indexes is
probably due to the twist of the aforementioned events. Second, we analyse if GT-COVID-19
indices explain the stock market returns. Given that an epidemic disease is by definition an
adverse event, GT indices can be interpreted as a measure of coronavirus-related uncertainty
and perceived risk.
Our findings show that GT-COVID-19 indices contribute to explain the dynamic of the
stock market returns for Italy, Spain and Germany. Interestingly, substituting country-specific
GT indices with the Italian one magnifies the exposition of all considered markets to COVIDrelated public concern, bursting the explained variance of stock index returns.
This highlights that the pandemic outbreak in Italy may have exerted a role in the general
perception of the pandemic severity. In this respect, we finally perform a time-varying analysis
to investigate the impact of the GT-COVID-19 indices on the financial markets over time.
Interestingly, we identify the most severe impacts during each step of the Italian lock-down
process and find almost no impact prior to the beginning of the pandemic in Europe, even
though the presence of COVID-19 in China was already known by the end of December 2019.
The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 briefly illustrates the dataset and data
collecting process, then Section 3 presents the main results. Finally, Section 4 concludes.

Data

We collected social and financial data for a panel of N = 6 countries, including Germany (DE),
France (FR), United Kingdom (GB), Unites States (US), Italy (IT) and Spain (ES), for T = 75
working days, from 1 January 2020 to 14 April 2020.
As for the financial data, we have downloaded the closing price of the stock market index1
at daily frequency from Bloomberg, and obtained the log-returns.
Social data collection The raw social data have been systematically collected from Google
using the GtrendsR package by [10], which sends requests to the Google Trends website
exploiting the query parameters in the URL of the request (see Table 1).
We have downloaded daily search relative volumes per country, from 01/01/2020 to
14/01/2020, on Google Search (all), Youtube and Google News, matching the “coronavirus”
topic. Then, the time series have been rescaled in the [0, 1] interval. Topics are groups of
terms that have equivalent meanings in different languages. Searching by topic, rather than by
term(s), has several practical and theoretical advantages, including:
1

We used the following indices: S&P500 (US), FTSE MIB 30 (Italy), DAX (Germany), CAC 40 (France),
IBEX (Spain) and FTSE 100 (Great Britain).

Table 1: Google Trends query parameters

• No “priors” affecting results: with this method a topic is given as it is, e.g. no means
to strategically “stretch it” or “prune it”. Researchers, on their side, have the advantage
of not having to use their prior knowledge about the topic to choose the terms used
to identify it. For example, one could erroneously specify a set of terms that are not
representative for the topic he wants to study;
• No need to “translate” the query terms: the topic’s identifier is unique for all
languages and all countries in the world. Therefore, with the same identifier one can
extract data about a topic for any country, in whatever language. This is a huge advantage
for studies that comprise different countries with different languages and different degree
of usage of the various technical terms related to a topic (e.g COVID-19 vs Coronavirus).
It also allows to take into account searches done in a country in a language other than
the official one(s)2 . Therefore the data obtained will also be representative of searches
made by linguistic minorities/foreigners;
• Overcoming the “number of terms” limit: since Google Trends imposes a limit on
the number of terms that can be used jointly to build queries, if a topic is related to many
terms, using terms is never convenient.
Preliminary analysis Figure 1 shows the time series of log-returns and the three groups of
GT indices, subdivided by source. For each country i ∈ {DE, F R, GB, US, IT, ES}, we observe
the log-return series, yi,t , and three GT indices GTj,i,t, where j ∈ {Y, N, S}, corresponding to
YouTube, Google News and Google Search, respectively. The country-specific GT series have
a common dynamic, whereas for each source there is cross-country heterogeneity.
We remark that high values of either GT index correspond to intervals which exhibit
turbulent dynamics for financial returns. This is particularly evident throughout March.
Moreover, we notice that the Italian GT indices (for each source) anticipate those of the other
countries. To test for the presence of lead-lag relations, we perform a cross-correlation analysis
of each series against Italy. Table 2 reports the peak in the cross correlation, where negative
values implying that the series for Italy is leading. By looking at the beginning of the period, we
observe that both the GT indices and the financial series do not appear to react to epidemicsrelated facts originated in China. Overall, these findings corroborate the interpretation that
public concern has cross-country similarities, with Italy acting as the forerunner.

Empirical results

3.1

Constant parameters regression

In this section we present the results of country-specific regressions, aiming to discover a possible
relation between social media data and the returns on each country’s market index. We focus
on YouTube data, that is GTi,t = GTY,i,t , however we have obtained similar results using either
Google News or Google Search data.3
We investigate the exposition of markets to public concern, as proxied by GT-COVID-19
indices, by estimating the following AR(1)-X model. We focus on YouTube indices, that is
GTj,i,t = GTY,i,t. Analogous results have been obtained using either Google News or Google
Search indices.
yi,t = αi + βi GTi,t + δi yi,t−1 + ǫi,t .

As a robustness check, we also run a regression using as covariate the first principal component estimated
from the three series and obtained similar results. Results are available upon request to the authors.

Robust standard errors are in parentheses, *, ** and *** denote statistical significance at 10%,
5% and 1%, respectively.

Table 3 highlights that the impact of the country-specific GT-COVID-19 index is significant
and negative for all countries except France and Great Britain. This implies that markets
negatively respond to public concern, as proxied by GT-COVID-19 indices.
Following the insights from the lead-lag relations, we check the exposition of markets to
public concern in Italy by estimating the model using GTi,t = GTIT,t for all i. Interestingly,
from Table 4, we observe that the Italian GT-COVID-19 index is a key explanatory variable
for all country-level stock index returns, and its use remarkably increases the adjusted R2 as
compared to using country-specific GT indices. In particular, the markets in FR and GB are
insensitive to the public concern proxied by their GT indices, but are negatively related to the
Italian GT-COVID-19. This highlights that the severity of the outbreak perceived from Italy
represents a timely indicator of the destabilizing effect of the pandemic on financial markets.
As robustness check, we have controlled for country-specific market implied volatility and
growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases, our findings remain unchanged.

TVP analysis

To further deepen the relation between the GT-COVID-19 indices and market returns, we
estimate a time-varying parameter model, where the impact of the GT-COVID-19 index is
5

allowed to vary according to a latent AR(1) process
yi,t = αi + βi,t GTi,t + δi yi,t−1 + ǫi,t
βi,t = Ai βi,t−1 + ηi,t

ǫi,t ∼ N (0, σi )
ηi,t ∼ N (0, Bi ),

where ǫi,t and ηi,t are mutually independent. Estimation of βi,t is performed using the Kalman
smoother, without imposing stationarity restrictions on the autoregressive coefficients Ai .

Figure 2: Log-returns (black, solid line) and estimated coefficient β̂i,t (blue, dot-dashed line) of GTCOVID-19 index for YouTube. Vertical red lines correspond to 23 January (first COVID-19 case in
Germany), 24 February (lock-down of northern Italian provinces), 9 March (lock-down for all Italian
citizens), 12 March (lock-down of most Italian economic activities).

Figure 2 plots the estimated paths of the impact of the GT index on the corresponding
stock index returns. All country-specific coefficients share a common dynamic. The impact of
all GT indices drops to negative values the same day of key events related to COVID-19. In
particular, the lowest peaks occur in correspondence of the enactment of the Italian lock-downs.
Moreover, before the first confirmed case in Europe (23 January) all the coefficients are very
close to zero. This signals that the GT indices had no explanatory power prior to the spreading
of the pandemic to Europe, even though the presence of COVID-19 in China was already known
since the end of December 2019.
Robustness checks The main findings of the constant parameter analysis are robust to
controlling for implied volatility and number of confirmed cases (see Appendix B). In addition,
we have checked the robustness: (i) using a lagged version of the social index, (ii) inclusion of
daily and weekly lags of the social index, controlling or not for the lagged financial return.4
Moreover, the results of the TVP analysis are robust to: (i) using a lagged version of the social
index, (ii) controlling or not for the lagged financial return, (iii) specifying more lags in the
dynamics of the coefficients.5

Conclusions

Recent literature has shown that Google Trends data can successfully explain the current and
future patterns of the state of the economy, especially during unfavorable events [8, 13, 14].
Differently from recent financial crises, COVID-19 is an exogenous shock to the system that has
affected several countries with different timings related to the spreading of the disease. We have
investigated the exposure of the stock index returns of Italy, France, Germany, Great Britain,
the United States and Spain to GT-COVID-19 indices based on search-engine query volumes.
Our findings show that most of these indices have significant explanatory power on stock
market returns. Interestingly, the Italian GT-COVID-19 index acts as forerunner and better
explains other countries’ market returns. Moreover, the greatest impact of GT indices occur in
correspondence of the different phases of the lock-down in Italy, despite the public awareness of
the contagion in China since January. The disruptive effect of COVID-19 on financial markets
is well described by the public concern perceived in Italy, which has been the first Western
country to experience a virulent outbreak and to adopt drastic measures after China.

Data collection

Google Trends provides a rescaled values of relative search volumes per unit-of-time. The
data-generation procedure can summarized as follows:
1. Extract a random sample of queries corresponding to the searched geographical area,
category and time-span;
2. For every unit-of-time (whose length/duration depends on the time-span) divide the count
of the number of searches matching the query term(s)/topic parameter (q), by the total
number of searches in the same unit-of-time;
3. Rescale the obtained time series in the [0, 100] interval by: (a) removing the minimum
value of the series to all values, (b) dividing all values of the series by the maximum value
of the series, (c) multiply all values by 100, (d) round all values to the nearest integer.

Robustness checks

We checked the robustness of our findings by estimating the constant parameters model with
additional lags of the GT indices, aiming to capture the daily and weekly effects. Moreover,
we controlled for (i) the country-specific implied volatility6 (IVi,t ), and (ii) the country-specific
growth rate of new COVID-19 cases7 (∆% CCi,t ).
In the latter case, we estimated the model
yi,t = αi + βi GTIT,t + δi yi,t−1 + γi IVi,t + ωi ∆% CCi,t + ǫi,t ,

ǫi ∼ N (0, σi ).

Additional robustness checks are available upon request to the authors.
