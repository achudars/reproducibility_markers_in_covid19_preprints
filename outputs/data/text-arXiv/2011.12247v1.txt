Abstract
Distinguishing COVID-19 from other flu-like illnesses can be difficult due to
ambiguous symptoms and still an initial experience of doctors. Whereas, it is
crucial to filter out those sick patients who do not need to be tested for SARSCoV-2 infection, especially in the event of the overwhelming increase in disease.
As a part of the presented research, logistic regression and XGBoost classifiers,
that allow for effective screening of patients for COVID-19, were generated.
Each of the methods was tuned to achieve an assumed acceptable threshold of
negative predictive values during classification. Additionally, an explanation of
the obtained classification models was presented. The explanation enables the
users to understand what was the basis of the decision made by the model. The
obtained classification models provided the basis for the DECODE service (decode.polsl.pl), which can serve as support in screening patients with COVID-19

1. Introduction
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges for the
physicians around the world. A new disease requires the development of new
drugs, procedures and approaches to treating patients. Additionally, diagnostics
may be a challenge, especially when there are few obvious and unambiguous
symptoms differentiating the disease from other infections. The list of symptoms
associated with COVID-19 does not allow for unequivocal distinction of COVID19 from other influenza-like illnesses. Limited testing capacity is one of the
biggest problems the healthcare systems are facing. Hence, it is crucial to filter
out those sick patients who do not need to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The diagnosis of the patient’s condition requires experience supported by reliable and unambiguous straightforward diagnostic methods. As long as rapid,
inexpensive and reliable testing does not support the physicians in their work,
experience is imperative. Experience can be gained by analysing cases of subsequent patients arriving to the hospital. Besides, it can be enriched owing to
a comprehensive analysis presenting conclusions for a larger set of data.
Literature studies show that machine learning methods were verified and
gave good results for a number of diagnostic tasks [1]. Various types of classification models were studied in the past for the diagnosis of patients with diseases
such as for example Ebola [2], HIV [3], heart disease [4], cancer [5] or diabetes [6].
Referring to the listed applications of machine learning in diagnostics, it can be
concluded that prognostic models can provide a valuable summary of clinical
knowledge and can be useful when such expertise is unavailable [2].
The choice of methods supporting patient classification and diagnosis may

2

depend on the type of data analysed. For example, diagnostics based on image
analysis currently uses mainly deep learning methods, e.g. [5, 7]. Other types of
data, including data collected from questionnaires, are analysed using various
methods, among which there can be identified a division ([8]) into statistical
approaches represented by logistic regression and data-driven machine learning
methods (e.g. decision tree based methods, SVM, Naı̈ve Bayes, kNN). Many of
the works, however, verify and compare the quality of several different models,
e.g. [4, 9, 10].
The main motivation for this work was the interest of the medical community
in what characterizes COVID-19 (e.g. as opposed to influenza) and whether it
is possible to create classifiers of acceptable quality that can support diagnostics
based on survey questions to identify people suffering from COVID-19. Such
solutions can be especially valuable for new diseases, when there is little experience available and when the number of patients is growing rapidly becoming
overwhelming for the healthcare system, as in the case of COVID-19.
Another motivation was the need to learn and understand the COVID-19
disease from the possibly broadest perspective. As the research results show
([11]), the course of the disease for various reasons may be different for different
populations and therefore the analysis of data from Poland may be valuable.
The study aims to provide the medical community, especially family doctors,
with a tool to distinguish patients suffering from other common infections from
individuals who are suspected for COVID-19 and need to be further diagnosed
with more advanced molecular methods. The main intention was thus to limit
the number of patients referred to genetic testing and still omit possibly few
COVID-19(+) cases.
Therefore, the aim of this study is to verify two classification approaches as
screening methods that can support the diagnosis of sick patients with COVID19. The classification is intended to be based on the symptoms identified during
the initial assessment of the patient condition. The methods utilised in the
research are the classifiers that are the most popular and efficient in medical
and tabular data analysis. Another goal of this work is to provide a new data
3

set enriching the knowledge on the COVID-19 disease and to share the results
of analysis concerning both the data and the generated classification models.
Contribution of this work is threefold. Primarily it consists of generating
the classifiers that are tuned to an assumed acceptable threshold of negative
predictive values so that the results allow for effective screening of patients for
COVID-19. Besides, the contribution contains an explanation of the obtained
classification models enabling the users to understand what was the basis of
the decision made by the model. Finally, in conjunction with this analysis,
a new data set is shared, based on questionnaires collected in a hospital in
Poland. The last part of the contribution consists of the data set preparation,
processing, characterization and visualization leading to the identification of
COVID-19 characteristics. It is assumed that providing a data set along with its
characterization and predictive analysis performed on this set will be a valuable
opening for further analysis and meta-analysis.
The performed analysis resulted in an online service1 available for anyone
who needs support in COVID-19 diagnostics.
The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of
previous research related to the presented topics. Section 3 outlines the characteristics of the shared data set being the basis for classification models. Section
4 presents data preparation steps and two applied approaches to classifier generation and tuning. Section 5 focuses on the evaluation of the models created.
Section 6 presents the discussion and explanation of the results obtained. Section 7 outlines the developed web application that makes an initial diagnosis
based on the given symptoms. Section 8 concludes the paper.

many studies have recently been published dealing with this issue from different perspectives. Many works on the use of machine learning methods to
diagnose COVID-19 have been covered in review articles such as [12], [7] and
[13].
The work [12] presents the analysis of the research dynamics in the field
between January and May 2020. In this work, based on the frequency of occurrence of various methods, the following classes of solutions were distinguished:
Deep Learning approaches (CNN, LSTM and others), Mathematical and Statistical methods, Random Forest, SVM, and Others (e.g. Linear Regression,
XGBoost). The described approaches were applied to various data types with
a predominance of X-ray images and achieved good results. However, the lack
of real data was explicitly highlighted in the work.
An extensive meta-analysis (107 studies with 145 models) of the works published between January and April 2020 is presented in [7]. In this study, three
classes of predictive models are distinguished, and these are models for use in
the general population, for COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis. Among 91 diagnostic models, 60 focus on image analysis, while 9 predict the disease severity.
Out of the remaining 22 works presenting diagnostic models not based on imaging, only two studies were based on the data sets containing more than 1000
examples.
The review [13] discusses among others machine learning in COVID-19 screening and treatment. The examples of approaches presented in this work are
focused on image and clinical data (e.g. blood test results) based diagnostics.
Among the studies presenting diagnostic machine learning-based models [7],
the works presented below can be distinguished as the most interesting due to
the size of a data set, questionnaire-based data features and utilised analytical
approaches.
The work [14] presents a statistical analysis of data attributes and generation
of multivariate logistic regression model on a data set consisting of 1702 individuals (579 were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 1123 negative), whose data were
collected through the online application. The attributes describing each exam5

ple included personal characteristics (sex, age, BMI) and flu-like symptoms (e.g.
fever, persistent cough, loss of taste and smell, etc.).
The study [15] presents an approach where based on routinely collected
surveillance data a multiple model using logistic regression was generated. The
data set that was the basis of the analysis consisted of 5739 patient records
(1468 were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 4271 negative) collected in Brazil.
There are numerous data sets related to COVID-19 reported [16]. Such data
sets include information on COVID-19 diagnosis, case reporting, transmission
estimation, sentiment analysis from social media and semantic analysis from the
collection of scholarly articles. Most of the COVID-19 diagnosis data are based
on image (CT scans, X-ray images) analysis.
A data set [dataset][17] that can be referred due to the subset of similar
features was collected by Carbon Health, a healthcare provider in the US. The
anonymised data of Carbon Health patients were collected between March and
June 2020. The data includes the clinical characteristics (epifactors, comorbidities, vitals, clinician-assessed symptoms, patient-reported symptoms) and
laboratory results of patients on the date of service.
Another data set [dataset][18] was collected at the Hospital Israelita Albert
Einstein, at Sao Paulo, Brazil. Hospital patients had samples collected to perform the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and additional laboratory tests. The created
data set contains 5644 examples of which 10% were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The
attributes consist of virus, blood and urinea test results and internal assignment
to a hospital ward. This data set was analysed in [19] and its part was analysed in [20]. The study [19] presents the results of several different classification
methods (Logistic Regression, Neural Network (multi-layer perceptron), Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Gradient Boosting) in terms of their
quality. Three directions of analysis were chosen in this study covering identification of: patients that are likely to receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result,
COVID-19 patients that are likely to require hospitalisation, and COVID-19
patients that are likely to require intensive care. Additionally, within each direction, the feature importance was identified.

In response to the growing demand for information on modern IT services
developed in the healthcare sector, and in order to coordinate activities undertaken in this regard in Europe, the mHealth Innovation and Knowledge Hub was
created on the initiative of WHO ITU/Andalusian Regional Ministry of Health
[21]. It was established to collect and share experiences on modern e-medicine
solutions and to support countries and regions in implementing large-scale activities in this regard.
mHealth initiatives are especially important these days, when the World is
facing SARS-CoV-2. Many governments, companies, and citizens movements
have developed various mHealth solutions to keep the population informed and
help manage the crisis situation. A repository of such solutions developed in Europe can be found in [22]. It is a dynamic resource that is updated as additional
tools are reported.
Among the many services created around the world, there can be found
those that help to find out whether someone may have been exposed to the
coronavirus in order to reduce the spread of the virus [23, 24, 25]. Others
serve patients in a better understanding of the mechanisms of the COVID-19
or are the channels of updated information on regional regulations including
territory-specific restrictions [26, 27]. Some of the solutions provide the most
up-to-date research findings and information, including all the latest data on
COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment thereby helping medical personnel make
informed clinical decisions [28].
There are also applications that, similarly to the service presented in this
study, support the diagnosis of sick patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection based
on the symptoms of the disease. For example, solutions presented in [29, 30, 31,
32, 33, 34, 35, 36] allow to self-assess the possible symptoms of this infectious
disease and to learn about the recommendations to be followed. Some of them
give the estimated risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection as a result, however, they do
not disclose the methods used in these estimates. In addition, some mentioned
applications are available only in one language version (e.g. in Italian [35]) or
are intended for use in a given region or country and they require selecting
7

the name of a specific locality/province when completing the questionnaire [36].
Other ones are not publicly available and need a special social security number
assigned by local Health Service to activate the application [37]. Some, in turn,
are targeted only for medical staff [38].
A relatively small group of applications [39, 40] are those developed as a result of published research [41, 42]. The corresponding works concerned COVID19 diagnostics using various machine learning methods. The common feature of
the data analysed by them were attributes describing blood indices.
The state of the art survey presented above shows that there exist numerous
approaches proving the usability of classification models in COVID-19 diagnostics. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there are no approaches
reported as a research paper taking into consideration solely questionnaire data
what can be valuable when the healthcare system is overloaded or clinical tests
are not available. There are numerous online applications performing symptombased diagnosis, however, no information on the applied methodology is given.
Another conclusion is that there are freely available data sets on the Internet,
however the sets containing data of more than 1000 patients are scarce and it
is still important to enrich the available data representation. Additionally, to
the best of the authors’ knowledge, there were no questionnaire-based data sets
collected in Poland reported and it is worth filling this gap.

3. Data set
The data set was collected at Specialised Hospital No. 1 in Bytom, Poland
between 21st February 2020 and 30th September 2020 thanks to the cooperation
of hospital staff and data scientists involved in the project.
Data acquisition was a process starting at the hospital where people arrived
in order to be diagnosed. Before any examination or testing, each person was
asked to fill in the questionnaire containing questions relevant to COVID-19
diagnosis. Initially, the survey was containing few questions about the basic
symptoms consisting of the occurrence of temperatures exceeding 38o C, cough

8

and dyspnoea. With time and increasing knowledge about the COVID-19 characteristics, the survey was enriched with further questions and options. When
the final diagnosis resulting from SARS-CoV-2 test was known, the survey was
anonymised, scanned, tagged with SARS-CoV-2 test result and sent to the
database of survey images. Next, the information encapsulated in each survey was transformed into a feature vector, i.e. an example in our data set.
The questionnaires were filled in by patients themselves. People waiting to
be admitted to the hospital for further tests may feel unwell and anxious, which
affects the consistency and quality of completing the questionnaires. Therefore,
a synthetic and unambiguous form of the survey was developed, which is now
utilised within the web application (see Fig. 5) being one of the results of this
research. Nevertheless, due to such manual nature of data collection, the data
was subject to additional inspection in order to remove errors introduced while
completing the survey.
The collected data set consisted of 3114 patient records.

Each patient

recorded in the collected data was described by 32 attributes. Within these
attributes the following classes of patient characteristics can be identified:
• 18 attributes describing symptoms,
• 7 attributes listing comorbidities,
• 3 attributes representing the patient’s condition.
The other attributes include epidemiological attributes such as: age, sex, blood
group and contact with infection. Each patient was classified by two conditions:
• Symptoms: Healthy / Sick
• SARS-CoV-2 test result: Positive / Negative
The quantitative characteristics of the collected sample from population on the
basis of the classification listed above is presented in Table 1.
In the presented study patients who experienced disease symptoms (Sick)
were taken into consideration, i.e. 1941 people. From this group, 577 patients,

3.1. Data preparation
The first step of the initial data preparation was related to the aim of the
conducted research, which was the screening of sick patients to help identify
SARS-CoV-2 infections and, more importantly, to filter out only patients with
other infections, who do not require molecular tests. Having the defined goal
in mind, the subset of patients identified as sick was selected from the collected
data set presented in Table 1 and this subset was used in further analysis.
Next, due to the fact that there were many missing values in the collected
data, it was necessary to select the attributes and cases to generate the best
possible classification model. In order to perform data selection, the data set
was transformed into a binary representation where missing records were marked
with the value of 1, while complete records with the value of 0. For the ”contact
with infected person” variable missing value was treated as a negative answer
due to the survey construction: patients were asked to tick ”Yes” option only if
they knew they were exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Next, hierarchical clustering with
the Hamming distance [43] and McQuitty agglomeration [44] was performed for

10

features and patients separately. Finally, the cluster of patients with the highest
level of missing information was removed from the data set and the cluster of
features with the highest level of missing data was not considered in further
analysis. The dendrograms leading to the selection process and the data that
was rejected in this selection are illustrated in Fig. 1. The data subjected to the
selection are illustrated at the Fig. 1, with missing and complete information
marked with red and bright green colors, respectively. The dendrograms serving
for the selection are at the sides of the figure. Branches highlighted in red
correspond to patients or features excluded from the further analysis due to
high missing data levels.
The list of data features was reduced to 16 and it contained: sex, contact with
infected person, number of days of symptoms, temperature > 38o C, maximal
temperature, cough, dyspnoea, muscle aches, loss of smell or taste, sore throat,
headache, dizziness, skin reactions, temperature (measured at the hospital),
saturation, and age. Characteristics for exemplary attributes commonly referred
as related with SARS-CoV-2 infection are presented in Fig. 2.

4. Classification approaches
Within the conducted research, two classifiers developed by two separate
research groups were verified. It was decided that one of the model generation
methods would be logistic regression [45] representing statistical approaches,
while the second would be the XGBoost method [46] implementing Gradient
Boosting model that is a leading data-driven machine learning approach. The
R implementation of generalized linear models fitting for logistic regression and
the xgboost package implementing XGBoost method in the R [47] environment
were used in the analysis.
The initial data set was common to each of the approaches, however, the
models were generated in separate processes. Therefore, different data preparation and feature selection steps could be applied and hence different splits
into training and test data within the model generation process were possible.

However, both generated models were evaluated on a common test data set and
additional collection of data available online [17].
As a part of the undertaken task, it was assumed that the positive examples
denoted as COVID-19(+), were SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who had symptoms of COVID-19 disease. Negative examples denoted as COVID-19(–), were
patients who were not infected by SARS-CoV-2 and suffer from a disease other
than COVID-19.

The goal of the analysis was to derive a classification tool able to support the
filtration of COVID-19(–) patients within the population of sick ones to narrow
down the number of patients who need further molecular testing. Therefore,
it can be said that false negative examples are more costly in this analysis
than false positive ones and, using classification quality measures, that it is
more important to achieve high sensitivity value than high specificity. However,
when presenting the public health solutions and the results of medical analysis,
the positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) are
applied as they are commonly used to describe the performance of a screening
and diagnostic test[48]. As part of the research, Weighted Harmonic Mean
(WHM) of NPV and PPV served in the classifier optimisation process:

−1
w
1−w
W HM =

.
NPV
PPV

(1)

In diagnostic test the weight can be equally distributed between NPV and PPV.
However, here the screening test is applied, thus the importance of NPV should
13

be higher than of PPV to maximally reduce the number of undetected COVID19(+) patients (false negatives). This should be reflected in a value of the weight
w ∈ [0, 1].
4.1. Logistic regression based approach
For the features remaining after the initial data selection, the effect size was
calculated (Cramér’s V and Rank Biserial Correlation for discrete and continuous features respectively) [49, 50]. Only features with at least small effect were
preserved for further analysis. Hence, during the logistic regression model generation five attributes were considered: i.e. contact with infected person, number
of days of symptoms, temperature> 38o C, loss of taste/smell, and dyspnoea.
Additionally, for those attributes all possible pair interactions were constructed
(intersections ∩; logical AND) e.g. occurrence of temp.> 38o C and dyspnoea
simultaneously will result in logical 1 for interaction variable. When at least
one of the attributes is 0, the interaction value is numerically 0.
Finally, logistic regression approach does not handle missing values, so patients with incomplete information regarding five considered features were rejected. However, for the ”contact with infected person” variable, the lack of an
answer was equivalent to negation, so all missing values were replaced with negative responses. As a result, the training data set consisted of 572 examples, 185
of which were positive (COVID-19(+)) and 387 were negative (COVID-19(–)).
The steps of the analysis presented in the consecutive paragraphs were repeated 100 times within the Multiple Random Cross-Validation (MRCV) process. Patients left after filtration were randomly divided into training and validation sets in equal proportions (50:50). The division was balanced in terms
of COVID-19 diagnosis as well as with regard to the considered set of features
so that, for instance, patients with a particular symptom were not underrepresented in train or test set.
Next, the logistic regression model was built with the forward feature selection method. Therefore, in each step new attribute was added to the model
based on the selection criterion, which in this case was the Bayes Factor. New
14

attributes were added until the Bayes Factor value decreased below 1, which
is described as a “barely worth mentioning evidence” [51],[52]. The attributes
were either previously selected five features or their pairs’ interactions.
As the logistic regression model provides the probability that an observation
belongs to a particular category (in this case COVID-19(+)), the cut-off value
of the probability must be determined to classify each patient. The cut-off probability was identified in a way to maximize the WHM (1) with a weight w equal
to 0.85. The enhanced importance of NPV reduces the risk of false negative observations’ occurrence for the screening test purposes. Moreover, applied weight
reflects standards in design medical screening test were NPV>90 and PPV>30
is expected[53]. For medical reasons, it is crucial to avoid COVID-19(+) patients exclusion from further diagnosis procedures, while molecular testing for
SARS-CoV-2 infection of some COVID-19(-) patients is both acceptable and
inevitable. The cut-off value could only be selected from the interval 0.1-0.9.
Finally, the quality of prediction for the training and validation sets were calculated.
After the MRCV procedure, the feature ranking was prepared based on the
feature significance in the model and model’s quality characterized by the WHM
(1) with a weight w equal to 0.85. The forward feature selection was again
applied for the final model building. However, this time the feature ranking
determined the order in which attributes were added to the model. During
each step, the data set was divided into training and validation part in a 50:50
proportion 100 times and quality was estimated for each division. The model
with the highest average WHM value for validation sets was selected as the final
one. The cut-off probability was identified in a way to maximize the WHM value.
The parameters of the final model are presented in Table 3 and its performance
calculated on the whole train data set is presented in Table 4.
4.2. Gradient Boosting based approach
This approach was designed to use all available attributes and binary interactions between binary features. If two features a and b were binary ones then

a new binary feature a ∪ b was created and its value was calculated by applying
logical OR operation.
The next steps of the analysis aimed in limiting the number of features
involved in the classification in order to better explain the decisions made by
the model. For this purpose, all information related to the measurement of
body temperature was removed from the set of features, except for the binary
feature indicating whether the patient had a temperature greater than 38o C.
This step was motivated by no significant differences between the values of
temperature and maximum temperature in both studied classes. Besides, the
numerical variables that the XGBoost algorithm prefers to construct the tree

16

were removed in this way.
Moreover, further feature selection based on 100 draws of a subset of the
available data was performed. Each draw selected at least 60% of the examples
and 60% of the attributes. On such a limited data set, the XGBoost algorithm
was run in the 10 times five-fold cross-validation mode and the ranking of the
importance of features in the trained classifier was recorded. Then, the average position of a feature in the ranking was calculated. This average ranking
consisted of only those features that occurred at least 60 times in the selected
subsets. In this way, the set A consisting of all features presented in Table 5
and their interactions (OR) between binary features was obtained. The value
of sum of symptoms feature was calculated on the basis of 11 disease symptoms
included in the training set.

The steps of analysis presented in the consecutive paragraphs were repeated
100 times within the MRCV process. Patients left after filtration were randomly divided into training and validation sets in 60:40 proportions. Within
this procedure the optimisation process based on forward feature selection was
performed. The W HM (1) evaluation measure was used in the optimisation
process, and the weight value was set to w = 0.7 to enhance importance of NPV
and reduce in this way the risk of false negative observations’ occurrence, as the

17

method was developed for the screening test purposes.
In order to present the complete process of building the classifier we denote
by XGB(A, t, m) the average value of evaluation measure m calculated on the
basis of the results of MRCV procedure of the XGBoost algorithm built on the
basis of the set of features A. If t = tr, it means that the average value of m
is given on the training sets, if t = ts, it means that the average value of m
is given on the test sets. In each of the 100 experiments on the basis of which
the mean value of m is calculated, an internal optimization of the classification
threshold to the COVID-19(+) class is carried out.
Initially, the ability to classify each individual basic feature from the A set is
verified. This means that for each feature a ∈ A the scoring XGB({a}, ts, W HM )
is calculated. The feature with the highest scoring is selected as the best one.
This feature is the first one in the set of selected features denoted as B. Next,
further features a ∈ A \ B are added to B.
The process of adding features to the set of selected features B is carried
out as long as:
XGB(B, ts, W HM ) < XGB(B ∪ {a}, ts, W HM )
(2)

and
XGB(B, tr, W HM ) ≤ XGB(B ∪ {a}, tr, W HM ),
or
XGB(B, ts, W HM ) ≤ XGB(B ∪ {a}, ts, W HM )

(3)

and
XGB(B, tr, W HM ) < XGB(B ∪ {a}, tr, W HM ).

After the stage of expanding the set of features, the stage of pruning redundant features can be performed. Feature b is removed from set B if its removal
does not decrease (or it increases) the value of XGB(B, ts, W HM ), precisely:
XGB(B \ {b}, ts, W HM ) ≥ XGB(B, ts, W HM ).

(4)

The resulting set of features used further for classifier training consisted of
the following seven features: Contact with infected person OR Loss of smell
or taste, Loss of smell or taste OR Temp. > 38o C, Days of symptoms, Cough
18

OR Loss of smell or taste, Dyspnoea OR Contact with infected person, Temp.
> 38o C, Cough OR Contact with infected person.
After selecting the features, the next step in the analysis was optimisation of
the XGBoost algorithm parameters. It was carried out using the autoxgboost
[54] R package. This time the F1 measure was used as the optimization criterion
in order to increase Sensitivity and PPV value of the final classifier.
The performance of the model obtained in this way, that was calculated on
the whole train data set is presented in Table 6.

5. Evaluation of created models
Both created classification models presented in Section 4 were finally evaluated on additional data sets. The characteristic of the first test data set was
presented in Section 3. This data set was created as a result of a data split into
training and test data (Table 2) and it consists of 577 examples. This data set
will be referred further as PL.
The second data set was presented in Section 2 as the data set available
online [17]. This data set required an initial transformation which consisted in
removing all patients who did not show any of the diagnostic symptoms used
by the generated models and available in this collection (contact with infected
person, number of days of symptoms, temperature > 38o C, cough, dyspnoea,
muscle aches, loss of smell or taste, sore throat, headache). The characteristics
of the obtained data set are presented in Table 7. This data set will be referred
further as US.
The results of applying the XGBoost classifier to the PL test data set are
presented in Tables 8 and 11.

Additionally, the XGBoost classifier was applied to the reduced PL test data
set, in which there are no missing values. In this way it was possible to compare
the quality of both models. These results of XGBoost are presented in Tables
10 and 11.
Second evaluation of both generated classifiers was performed on US data
set. The XGBoost model performance on this data set is presented in Tables 12
and 15. Again, the logistic regression model was tested on the reduced US data
set, from which examples with missing values were removed, and it consisted of
337 examples. The logistic regression performance on this data set is presented
in Tables 13 and 15. The results of XGBoost tested on the reduced US data set

6. Discussion
The two presented classifiers developed in independent groups use a similar
set of features. The logistic regression model uses the features listed in section
4.1 in Table 3. The XGBoost model uses the features listed in section 4.2. The
XGBoost model uses two more base features compared to logistic regression,
i.e. dyspnoea and cough.
It is worth noting that both models are largely based on compound features
that were created in various ways. In the logistic regression model, interactions
are modeled by the logical operator AND, and in the XGBoost model by OR.
This is partly due to conducting research by two independent teams, but it also
reflects well how different methods can recreate interactions. Logistic regression
does not directly model the conjunction of the feature values, and the alternative
of feature values cannot be easily modeled in decision trees.
The obtained classification results show that the NPV of both methods is
acceptable for screening test, in particular the NPV of the logistic regression
22

model is above 0.90 on the PL and US sets. Both models have similar PPV
values. The logistic regression model is characterized by higher values of NPV
and Sensitivity, and XGBoost is characterized by higher values of Specificity.
This is partly due to the model optimization method. Besides, it confirms the
thesis that depending on the user’s preferences expressed in this article by the
weight value in formula (1), it is possible to obtain classifiers with different levels
of PPV and NPV.
The relation between parameter values and the decision represented by XGBoost models is difficult to interpret by a human. Logistic regression gives the
possibility to estimate the adjusted odds ratio (Table 3), which gives direct and
intuitive interpretation of obtained classifier parameters. However, to give a
unified comparison of both approaches the rpart decision trees [55] were created
to provide explanation between symptoms and the outcome predicted by the
models.
Having two sets of basic features selected for each model, decision trees were
generated to explain the behaviour of their representative models. First, two
training sets were prepared. The data sets consisted of patients with symptoms (Sick) representing the attributes which were used by the models and each
patient was assigned the decision given by the model. Then, based on these
two separate training sets two rpart decision trees were generated. Finally, it
was evaluated how well the decision trees approximate the decisions made by
the considered models. For each patient the decision given by the model was
compared with the decision given by its rpart approximation. For the decision
tree generated for the logistic regression model approximation the resulting Balanced Accuracy (BAcc) value was 0.967 and for the decision tree generated for
the XGBoost model approximation the resulting BAcc value was 0.937. Based
on such very high BAcc values it was possible to use the trees to explain the
relation between symptoms and models outcome.
Besides, similar decision trees using training sets based on selected feature
interactions were generated. However, since the representation of a tree based
on simple (basic) features can be better understood it was decided to include a
23

simpler version in the manuscript.
Generated decisions trees are presented in the Figures 3 and 4. Colours on
the Figures represent classes - COVID-19(+) is represented by red, COVID19(–) by blue. The more saturated the color of a node is, the greater the
dominance of examples from a given class in this node. The first row of rpart
tree node provides the information about the majority class of examples covered
by that node, the second provides the percentage of the cases from the node
that are classified by the approximated model into the majority class, and the
third row provides the percentage of all cases covered by that node. Branches
of the tree represent symptoms and their presence or lack thereof (yes means
that patient has a symptom and no that a symptom was not observed). Please
note that since the trees were built to approximate the models, their leaves
do not represent the patient outcome but the decision provided by the model
based on the particular set of symptoms. Decision trees can be used to explain
which combinations of symptoms and their values are taken into account while
predicting diagnosis. For example, it can be noted that in case of both models,
the long time of having symptoms no of days of symptoms >= 13 will results
in providing negative decision (COVID-19(–)), unless the patient observes the
loss of taste smell.
It is known from the literature [56, 57], that loss of taste or smell is frequently used as an early indicator of SARS-Cov-2 infection and therefore it is
not surprising that having it results in the positive decision (COVID-19(+))
in almost all cases for both classifiers. The only exception of this is a case of
the tree generated for the logistic regression model, where having more than
13 days of symptoms together with loss of taste or smell and temperature below 38o C results in the negative decision. However, in this case, this concerns
only 67% of cases from the leaf covering only 1% of examples. Another symptom very strongly related to the positive outcome is having a high temperature
(temp.>38o C ). Similarly, like in the previous cases, having significantly elevated
temperature predominantly results in the positive decision of the classifiers.
In general, the decision tree approximating the logistic regression model is
24

Figure 3: Decision tree generated to explain the behaviour of logistic regression classifier.

25

Figure 4: Decision tree generated to explain the behaviour of XGBoost classifier.

26

less complex and allows easy interpretation of the model’s decision making. The
decision making model can be expressed in 7 rules containing from 2 to 4 conditions (nodes). The tree approximating the XGBoost model is more complex.
In this case the decision model consists of 12 rules with 2 to 7 conditions. It is
interesting to analyse the description of the rules covering the largest number of
examples (i.e. rules built on the basis of tree paths from the root to the extreme
right and left leaves).
In case of logistic regression, a large part of the COVID-19(+) decisions is
made based on the number of days the patient has symptoms. If this number is
less than 8, the patient is classified as COVID-19(+). However, if this number
is greater than 13 and there is no loss of smell or taste, the patient is classified
as COVID-19(–). The first rule seems debatable, however, it can be explained
in such a way that in the era of the pandemic developing - in Poland a bit later
than in Western Europe - people who observed the basic symptoms associated in
the media with the possibility of COVID-19(+), decided to test themselves for
SARS-CoV-2. It should also be remembered that the described tree represents
the way of decisions made by the logistic regression model and not the actual
data set, While this model was optimized according to WHM, where w = 0.85,
which means that high NPV values were preferred. Thus, the rule is intuitive.
The extreme rules of the tree approximating the XGBoost model are more
intuitive but also cover fewer examples. The main rule classifying patients as
COVID-19(+) depends on the number of days of symptoms (< 10) and loss
of taste or smell (yes). The main rule to classify patients as COVID-19(–) is
based only on the number of days of persistent symptoms and if it is long enough
(>= 13), the patient is classified as COVID-19(–). The remaining rules describe
smaller sets of examples, and the decision is made on the basis of more detailed
information concerning e.g. contact with an infected person, the presence of
temperature above 38o C, cough and dyspnoea (the last two features are used
only in the XGBoost model).

7. DECODE service
DECODE is a symptom checker tool to assist patients and family doctors
in preliminary screening and early detection of COVID-19.
In DECODE service a patient has the opportunity to fill out a questionnaire
regarding his/her health condition and obtain a preliminary assessment of the
possibility of being sick with COVID-19 and, consequently, the need to be tested
for SARS-CoV-2.
The questions (Fig. 5) cover many problem areas related to possible COVID19 disease. In addition to the year of birth, sex, occurrence of signs that are
typical for coronavirus, such as fever over 38 degrees of Celsius, cough, dyspnoea,
loss of smell or taste, etc., the patient may add other disturbing symptoms and
state how long they last. Besides, the person completing the questionnaire has
the option of providing the names of chronic diseases – if any, and the names
of the medications that are constantly taken. Blood type is also taken into
account. In order to avoid possible inconsistencies, the questionnaire fields are
validated. For example, if a patient checks any symptoms, the length of their
presence must be greater than 0.
After completing and sending the questionnaire, the patient receives suggestions in the form of Negative/Positive and information which of the reported
symptoms and to what extent influenced the result. Moreover, the system informs users that obtained results are only prediction and only medical test can
fully confirm infection of SARS-CoV-2.
The link that allows the patient to return to the survey is active for 14 days.
Using this link the patient can, for example, report the next symptoms, if they
occur. In particular, when the patient knows what the PCR test results are,
he/she can share this information and help improve the service.
DECODE is available in two language versions (Polish and English) and is
integrated with the CIRCA diagnostic service which was also developed at the
Silesian University of Technology to support and accelerate COVID-19 imaging
diagnostics.

8. Conclusions
The paper presents the results of the study on classifiers tuned towards
achieving an assumed acceptable threshold of negative predictive values during
classification (screening) of patients suffering from COVID-19 disease.
Based on the feature set describing the disease symptoms, it was possible to
obtain classifiers that met the expectations concerning the detection of patients
with COVID-19 disease. This has been achieved at the expense of a relatively
low Positive Predictive Value. The classifiers’ efficiency was verified on the data
set obtained as part of the presented research, in the last period of collecting
the questionnaires and on the data set available online.
Thanks to an approximation of obtained classification models by a decision
tree, it was possible to explain – using the set of basic features – what features
and their values are the basis of decisions taken by the classifiers.
The obtained classification models provided the basis for the development
of the DECODE service (decode.polsl.pl) allowing the doctors for preselection
for further diagnostics in the event of the overwhelming increase in disease.
An inseparable part of the paper is a data set describing over 3100 patients
with verified (positively or negatively) SARS-CoV-2 infection. The set includes:
asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients with COVID-19
disease (referred to in the paper as COVID-19(+)), as well as symptomatic
patients but without SARS-CoV-2 infection (suffering from other diseases, e.g.
influenza, denoted as COVID-19(–)). In addition to information about symptoms, the data set includes information on comorbidities (e.g. hypertension,
diabetes, etc.). However, comorbidities were not analysed in the studies described in this paper. The data set is available to a wide group of researchers
and it is a significant data repository describing COVID-19 symptoms in the
Slavic population.
Further work will focus on improving classifiers to increase their specificity
(PPV and Specificity). This goal will be achieved by gathering a larger set of
examples obtained from the DECODE webservice users and through coopera-

30

tion with a greater number of hospitals. The developed classification models will
be periodically tuned and verified on newly emerging data. Another intended
research will start, in cooperation with hospitals, an analysis of the severity of
the course of the COVID-19 disease, as well as a survival analysis of patients
with a specific set of comorbidities. Besides, it is intended to study the course
of the COVID-19 disease depending on the medications taken by patients (the
DECODE webservice enables gathering this information).
