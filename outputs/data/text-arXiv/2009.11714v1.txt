Abstract
Due to the lockdown measures during the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the
economic activities and the associated emissions have significantly declined. This reduction in
emissions has created a natural experiment to assess the impact of the emitted precursor control
policy on ozone (O3) pollution, which has become a public concern in China during the last decade.
In this study, we utilized comprehensive satellite, ground-level observations, and source-oriented
chemical transport modeling to investigate the O3 variations during the COVID-19 in China. Here
we found that the O3 formation regime shifted from a VOC-limited regime to a NOx-limited regime
due to the lower NOx during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, instead of these changes of the O3
formation region, the significant elevated O3 in the North China Plain (40%) and Yangtze River
Delta (35%) were mainly attributed to the enhanced atmospheric oxidant capacity (AOC) in these
regions, which was different from previous studies. We suggest that future O3 control policies should
comprehensively consider the synergistic effects of O3 formation regime and AOC on the O3
elevation.
Introduction
Beginning in January 2020, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) began rapidly spreading
throughout China, first in Wuhan, and then in other major cities

1, 2.

In response, to prevent the

spread of COVID-19, the first lockdown was implemented on January 23rd, suspending nonessential traffic in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. Over the following days, major cities
throughout China issued similar travel restrictions and stringent lockdown measures, affecting over
half a billion residents. These restrictive measures resulted in substantial reductions in human

activities, which consequently induced unprecedented decreases in anthropogenic emissions of air
pollutants, especially from the industry and transportation sectors

3, 4

. In particular, during the

lockdown, NO2 levels in Eastern China were estimated to have decreased by ~65% compared to the
same period in 2019, mainly due to the reduction of vehicle emissions5, 6. Similarly, other pollutants
such as SO2 and CO also decreased. In contrast, during the same period, ozone (O3) increased
significantly with a nationwide increase of 47.3% 5, 7, 8.
Besides the lockdown period, China experienced persistent O3 pollutions in recent five years,
especially in urban areas 9-11. O3 is formed through non-linear photochemical reactions of nitrogen
oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) 12. The O3 sensitivity regime,
determined by the relative abundance of VOCs and NOx, plays a significant role in O3 formation 13,
14

. Previous studies have reported that the elevated O3 during lockdowns was mainly attributed to

the enhanced atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC) 15, 16, reflected by the levels of major oxidants
such as hydroxyl radical (OH) and nitrate radical (NO3) 17. Specifically, NO2 is defined as the main
sink of OH radical through the reaction to form nitric acid (HNO3) 18, 19. During the lockdown, the
drastic decreases in NO2 levels increased OH concentration, which then reacted with VOCs,
facilitating the formation of secondary pollutants
AOC and secondary pollution is still limited

21-23.

Unfortunately, the current understanding of

The COVID-19 lockdown provides an important

opportunity to study the interaction between emissions, AOC, and meteorological conditions.
In this study, we used observational and satellite data to identify changes in O3 levels and its
associated precursors (NO2 and HCHO) during the COVID-19 lockdowns in China. The
Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was also applied to analyze the characteristics
of air quality in the same period. The roles of the O3 sensitivity regime and AOC were also discussed
to provide an in-depth explanation for the increase in O3. We found that O3 elevations during the
COVID-19 lockdown period in the NCP and YRD were mainly controlled by enhanced AOC, even
suppressing the impacts of the O3 formation regime due to the reductions of anthropogenic
emissions. In contrast, O3 decreased slightly in the PRD. The results aim to formulate more effective
emission control policies, particularly focused on reducing AOC to battle the persistent O3 pollution
in China.
Results

Significant O3 variations during the Lockdown. Here we investigate O3 changes during
three periods around the COVID-19 Lockdown, which are defined as Pre-lockdown (January 6 to
January 22, 2020), Lockdown (January 23 to February 29, 2020), and Post-lockdown (March 1 to
March 31, 2020), respectively.
According to surface observation, changes in China's surface MDA8 O3 show significant
spatial variations from Pre-lockdown to Post-lockdown. During the Lockdown, elevated O3
occurred in large areas throughout northern and central China, while it decreased in South China
(Fig. 1a), consistent with previous studies 5, 15, 24. The most prominent O3 increase occurred in the

NCP (Fig. 1b), with a mean MDA8 O3 increase of 54% (from 24 ppb to 37 ppb) (Fig.1c). In Baoding
and Shijiazhuang (major cities in the NCP), O3 increased by over 100%. Moreover, in the YRD, a
noticeable MDA8 O3 increase of 44% (from 26 ppb to 38 ppb) was observed. During Post-lockdown,
observed O3 concentrations continued to increase in the NCP and YRD, partially due to the rising
temperature (Fig. S2). O3 variation is more complex in the PRD, however. In general, O3 levels
decrease from Pre-lockdown to Post-lockdown. But in Guangzhou, the most populated city of PRD,
an increase in O3 was observed. Considering the similar temperature levels between Pre-lockdown
and Lockdown over China, these variations are more related to the sudden reductions of O3
precursors.
In addition, heightened O3 pollution was observed in the NCP and YRD during the Lockdown
compared to the same period in 2019 (Fig. S3). Although O3 precursors decreased drastically in
these regions, mean MDA8 O3 levels were 14-19% higher than in 2019. In contrast, in the PRD, the
mean MDA8 O3 during the Lockdown of 2019 is close to (or even slightly higher) that in 2020, and
the opposite of the trend observed in the other regions. Similar temperature conditions are also found
during the Lockdown in 2019 and 2020, which fails to fully elucidate the O3 differences between
these two years, demonstrating that the emission reduction of O3 precursors plays a more critical
role in O3 variations. Considering the O3 results in the Lockdown periods in 2019 and 2020, it is
critical to deeply understand the seesaw phenomenon between elevated O3 and its reduced
precursors.

Changes of O3 precursors and formation regimes. Given that the ratio of HCHO to NO2
determines the O3 formation regimes, HCHO and NO2 are considered the most important precursors
of O3 25. The satellite column data and CMAQ model have revealed significant reductions of NO2
throughout much of China, especially in NCP and YRD regions (Fig S4a). According to the satellite
data, NO2 in the NCP, YRD, and PRD regions declined by 59.61%, 63.28%, and 44.03% during the
Lockdown respectively. These reductions are mainly attributed to the significant decline of NOx
emissions from industry, power, and transportation sectors illustrated by the source apportionment
analysis (Table. S6).
However, no noticeable changes were observed in the HCHO concentration during the
Lockdown. The spatial distribution of HCHO, similar to that of NO2, exhibits higher levels in
southeast China, whereas in western China, due to the low anthropogenic VOCs emissions, the
HCHO concentration is relatively low 26, 27. The HCHO in the atmosphere is mainly formed through
direct emissions from industrial and biogenic sectors and through secondary sources such as the
oxidation reaction between VOCs and OH. During the Lockdown, emissions of HCHO and other
VOCs declined significantly (-37%) in China (Table.S1) and therefore might have reduced HCHO
levels. However, the enhanced AOC 5 during Lockdown likely promoted the formation of HCHO
from secondary sources, offsetting the impact of the decline in HCHO emissions and explaining
why HCHO levels remained relatively constant. Also, the oxidation of methane, which has a long

lifetime and relatively stable concentrations, plays an important role in the HCHO concentration 28,
29

, which also might help maintain constant HCHO levels as shown in our source apportionment

analysis (Table.S6) during the Lockdown period.
In general, the O3 sensitivity regimes in China shifted from VOC-limited to NOx-limited during
the Lockdown, as indicated by both satellite data and model simulations (Fig. 2b). During the PreLockdown period in 2020, the VOC-limited regime dominates in the NCP, YRD, and PRD regions
due to the relative abundant NOx emissions from industry and transportation sectors, consistent with
the previous studies 30. However, during the Lockdown period, VOC-limited regimes transitioned
to NOx-limited regimes in these regions. The percentage of NOx-limited regimes in the NCP, YRD,
and PRD regions during the Lockdown period increased from 11%, 37%, and 31% to 56%, 65%,
and 69%, respectively. These changes in the O3 formation regime and NO2 and HCHO
concentrations were not observed in 2019 (Fig. S5a); NO2 and HCHO concentrations during the
periods in 2019 that correspond to the Pre-lockdown and Lockdown periods in 2020 remained
relatively constant, explaining the lack of variation in the O3 formation regimes (Fig. S5b).
Surprisingly, O3 levels increased in the NOx-limited regimes in the NCP and YRD regions
during the Lockdown period in 2020, even though pronounced reductions of NOx levels were
observed in these regions. This unusual phenomenon is contrary to previous studies 28, indicating
that the enhanced AOC might have played a more significant role in increasing O3 in these regions
during the Lockdown period in 2020.

The dominating role of the enhanced AOC in O3 formation. Our model simulations
demonstrated significantly enhanced AOC in the NCP and YRD regions, which is consistent with
the variation of O3 concentrations. HOx (OH and HO2) radicals, the main daytime oxidant, increased
significantly in central and northern China with the highest growth rates of 0.06 and 2.71 ppt for
OH and HO2 radical, respectively due to the relatively low levels of NO2, the primary HOx sink (Fig.
3a and Fig. S5a). Specifically, in the NCP, YRD, and PRD regions, the average increase in HOx was
0.79, 0.92, and 0.17 ppt, respectively. The rise in OH and HO2 radicals could be the leading cause
of the O3 increase during the Lockdown period in the NCP and YRD regions given their strong
association with O3 production 31-33.
The OH radicals oxidize VOCs to produce peroxy radicals such as HO2, which covert NO to
NO2 without consuming O3. Then the NO2 produces O3 through photolysis reactions, leading the O3
accumulation 34, 35.
At the same time, the NO3 radical, the primary nighttime oxidant, saw significantly increased
levels in the NCP and YRD regions during the Lockdown, with respective growth rates of 0.49 and
0.29 ppt due to the relatively low levels of VOC and NO2, both of which serve as important sinks
for the NO3 radical 36 (Fig. S6a). In contrast, in the PRD region, levels of the NO3 radical declined
(up to -0.21 ppt) (Fig. 3b-d). Given the enhanced AOC, a significant increase in O3 was observed in
the NCP and YRD regions. In the PRD, however, the constant AOC was responsible for a slight

decrease in O3. Importantly, in the NCP and YRD regions, the increase in O3 enhanced the AOC due
to local photochemistry 37, 38, creating a vicious cycle of heightening O3 levels.

O3 control policy implications. Based on this analysis, we have devised a conceptual scheme
to demonstrate the roles of the O3 formation regime shift and enhanced AOC on O3 level during the
COVID-19 Lockdown period in China (Fig. 4). Satellite data and model simulations have revealed
a pronounced shift in the O3 formation regime during the 2020 lockdown period from VOC-limited
to NOx-limited, due to the significant decline in NO2. Simultaneously, throughout much of China,
the AOC was enhanced, facilitating the secondary formation of O3 and HCHO in the atmosphere.
Given the synergistic effects of enhanced AOC and the O3 formation regime shift, a substantial
increase in O3 has occurred during the 2020 Lockdown period in much of China, particularly in the
NCP and YRD regions. In contrast, O3 levels during this period remained relatively stable in the
PRD region. Our results have emphasized the importance of balanced emission control policies for
reducing the O3 pollution events in China. Previous policies, which have focused on the arbitrary
reduction of primary emission of NOx, SO2, and VOCs, need to be reconsidered as different regions
have different O3 sensitivity, and current policies might unintentionally enhance AOC in certain
regions, thereby heightening ozone levels. With the synergistic effects of O3 formation regime and
AOC, O3 might be elevated in turn. In the future, we recommend that O3 control policies of emission
reduction utilize knowledge regarding the synergistic effect of O3 formation regime and AOC
variations in the atmosphere on O3 levels. Specifically, we believe emission control policies ought
to ensure a balance between emitted NOx and VOCs to maintain stable O3 formation regimes and
thereby control O3 emissions.

in October 2017 to monitor the spatiotemporal variation of air pollutants, greenhouse gases, UV
radiation, and clouds, worldwide. The onboard sensor, TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring
Instrument), has a sun-synchronous orbit with a local overpass time of approximately 13:30 and
near-daily global coverage1-3. TROPOMI data products are significantly improved compared to the
still operating OMI sensor, launched in 2004; specifically, TROPOMI data products feature
significantly increased spatial resolution and 1~5 times higher signal-to-noise ratios, compared to
OMI products4. On August 6, 2019, TROPOMI began outputting data at a higher resolution than
before (each near-nadir pixel size is now roughly 5.5 × 3.5 km2)5.
TROPOMI products are available for free through the Copernicus Open Access Hub
(https://scihub.copernicus.eu,

Google

Earth

Engine

(https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog, last access: 30th July, 2020) has
converted Level 2 TROPOMI data, provided by the Copernicus Open Access Hub, into the level 3
data used in this study through the bin_spatial operation for the harpconvert tool. In this study, we
utilized two TROPOMI datasets from Google Earth Engine, tropospheric NO2 column number
density, and tropospheric HCHO column number density, and re-projected them into the same
domain as model simulations by using a Lambert projection As suggested by Copernicus, Google
Earth Engine filters the source data to remove pixels with QA values less than 75% for tropospheric
NO2 column number density datasets and 50% for tropospheric HCHO column number density.
Model configuration and validation
A modified CMAQ model v5.0.2 with an expanded SAPRC-99 photochemical mechanism was
applied to simulate the O3 levels and track the sources of its precursors in China. The details of the
source-tracking technique have been described in many previous studies6-9 and thus are not
discussed here. The time interval for which the simulation was conducted spanned from January 1
to March 31, comprising the Pre-lockdown (January 6 to 22), Lockdown (January 23 to February
29), and Post-lockdown (March 1 to 31) periods. Simulations for the same period in 2019, a control
period during which there were no emission reductions due to the COVID-19 induced lockdowns,
were also conducted. The first five days (January 1-5 in 2019 and 2020) during the simulation
periods were chosen as spin-up and removed from the subsequent analysis. The model domain
included China and its surrounding countries (Fig. S1), with a horizontal resolution of 36 km × 36
km (127 × 197 grids). The vertical extent was ~20 km from the surface and divided into 18 sigma
layers with the first layer height at a height of ~35 m from the surface. The anthropogenic emissions
comprised of agriculture, industry, power, residential, and transportation sectors were based on the
Multi-resolution

Emission

Inventory

for

China

(MEIC,

v1.3,

0.25◦

×

0.25◦,

http://www.meicmodel.org). The anthropogenic emissions of different pollutants in China during

the Lockdown were adjusted according to a recent study to reflect the reduced human activity (Table
S1)10. Emissions from other countries were obtained from the Emissions Database for Global
Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) v4.3.1 (https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/overview.php?v=431).
Biogenic emissions were provided by the Model of Emissions of Gases and aerosols from Nature
(MEGAN) v2.111. The meteorological inputs were generated by the Weather Research and
Forecasting (WRF) model v4.2 (https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users), with the initial and
boundary conditions based on the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Final
(FNL)

dataset

(https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds083.2).
The WRF model performance was evaluated by comparing the predicted temperature (T),
relative humidity (RH) at 2 m above the surface, wind speed (WS), and wind direction (WD) at 10
m above the surface with observation data from the National Climatic Data Center
(ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/) (~1400 sites) (Table S2, S4). The model slightly
underestimated the T during the simulation periods, with the mean bias (MB) values of -1.35 to 0.43 similar to a previous study12. The gross error (GE) values (1.65-1.93) of WS were all within
the benchmark13. The WD was generally predicted successfully, with values around the benchmarks.
The simulation of RH was comparable with previous studies12, 14, 15. Overall, the WRF model
performed well, providing the CMAQ model with reliable meteorological inputs.
The CMAQ model simulations were validated using the observations (~1500 sites) from the
national air quality monitoring network (http://www.cnemc.cn/) (Table S3-S5). The model
accurately predicted the hourly O3 concentrations, with mean normalized bias (MNB) values of
0.04-0.13 and mean normalized error (MNE) values ranging from 0.09 to 0.17, which were all
within the criteria16, 17. The simulations of O3-8h were slightly overestimated with MNB values of
0.18-0.21, a little higher than the criteria.
The changes in O3, NO2, and SO2 during the simulation periods were accurately captured by
the model. In general, the model performed well, accurately simulating O3 levels throughout the
analyzed time periods.
NO2 and HCHO concentrations from 17 vertical layers (with the highest layer having a height
of ~10km) in the CMAQ model were added up to ascertain their tropospheric column concentrations.
The NO2 and HCHO column concentrations generated by the model were then compared with the
satellite data to determine the shift in O3 formation regimes. In our study, the O3 formation regimes
were categorized into VOC-limited, NOx-limited and transition regimes based on the formaldehyde
nitrogen ratio (FNR)18, 19. Here we set FNR < 1.0 as a VOC-limited regime, FNR > 2.0 as a NOxlimited regime and FNR between 1.0 and 2.0 as a transitional regime20, 21.
Supplement formula
The mean bias (MB), gross error (GE), and root mean square error (RMSE) were used for the
evaluation of WRF model performance, while the mean normalized bias (MNB), mean normalized
error (MNE), mean fractional bias (MFB) and mean fractional error (MFE) were used for the

validation of CMAQ model performance.
