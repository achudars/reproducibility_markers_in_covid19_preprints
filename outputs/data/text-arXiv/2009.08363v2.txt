Abstract. The COVID-19 pandemic so far has caused huge negative impacts on different areas
all over the world, and the United States (US) is one of the most affected countries. In this
paper, we use methods from the functional data analysis to look into the COVID-19 data in the
US. We explore the modes of variation of the data through a functional principal component
analysis (FPCA), and study the canonical correlation between confirmed and death cases. In
addition, we run a cluster analysis at the state level so as to investigate the relation between
geographical locations and the clustering structure. Lastly, we consider a functional time series
model fitted to the cumulative confirmed cases in the US, and make forecasts based on the
dynamic FPCA. Both point and interval forecasts are provided, and the methods for assessing
the accuracy of the forecasts are also included.

1. Introduction
Ever since December 2019 when the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has
first come to the attention of the general public in China, this epidemic has been spread to more
than 180 countries over the world, leading to extremely negative impacts on global public health
and economy. As of 08/25/2020, this virulent disease has caused a total of 23,721,008 confirmed
and 815,029 death cases around the world, according to the data collected at Johns Hopkins
University [38]. The United States (US) is the most severely hit country with 5,759,147 confirmed
and 177,873 death cases. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment
rate of US has reached 14.7% in April 2020, a record-high over-the-month increase since January,
1948. Although the rate has declined to 8.4% in August 2020, it still remains at a relatively
high level, compared to less than 4% before the pandemic.
A great amount of scientific efforts have been integrated to learn the progression of the
disease, and to mitigate its negative impact on people’s normal life. However, according to some
recent research [20], it is evident that the COVID-19 has become mutating. As pointed out by
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,
on 06/24/2020, the vaccine for the COVID-19 would not likely to be available until 2021. On
07/27/2020, the National Institutes of Health has announced the phase 3 clinical trial of the
investigational vaccine for the COVID-19. As currently there is no medication that can directly
eliminate the virus, many infected patients have to rely on their own immune systems to recover
under the help of standard treatments. As more and more COVID-19 data become available,
statisticians now commit to carrying out intensive data-driven analyses to precisely uncover the
epidemic characteristics of the COVID-19.
In this paper, we exploit methods from the functional data analysis to analyze the COVID-19
data of both confirmed and death cases in the US from 01/21/2020 to 08/15/2020. In this

study, our data are collected at state level (see Section 2 for details), with the following research
questions in mind:
(1) Does the practice of public health measures (e.g., social distancing and mask wearing)
help to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19? On the other hand, does the reopening
of business exacerbate the spread of the disease?
(2) Is there any quantitative way to understand the correlation between infections and deaths
caused by the COVID-19 in the US? Does the correlation vary from state to state?
(3) Is the spread of the COVID-19 related to the geographical locations of the infected
regions or hot spots (at the state level) in the US?
(4) Is there a way to have some reasonable forecasts with regard to the total number of
confirmed cases nationwide?

2. Preliminary analysis
We collect the number of confirmed and death cases of the COVID-19 from the 50 continental
states in the US between 01/21/2020 (the date of the first domestic confirmed case reported
in the US) to 08/15/2020 (the weekend before school reopening in most of the states). The
data of cumulative confirmed and death cases were collected at state level, from a publicly
available repository released and updated by New York Times (https://github.com/nytimes/
covid-19-data). In what follows, the daily confirmed and death cases are obtained effortlessly.
The majority of our analyses is done at the state level. Noticing the significant differences
in the population size for each state, we standardize the data, using the estimated population
size for each state at the end of year 2019 from the US Census Bureau (https://www.census.
gov/popclock) to scale all collected data (cumulative and daily cases), and save them in units
of “per million”. In Figure 1, we plot the number of daily confirmed and death cases in the
US. From early May to early June, the cumulative case-to-fatality rate (CFR) of the COVID-19
in the US has stayed consistently high around 6.01%, close to the estimate (6.1%) given in [1],
which is slightly higher than the CFR in Wuhan, China (5.8%) reported on 02/01/2020 [52], and
significantly higher than the global CFR (3.4%) according to WHO Director-General’s opening
remarks at the media briefing on 03/03/2020. In August, the CFR in the US has declined to
3.1%.
One important epidemic metric for the study of the infectious disease dynamics is the basic
reproduction number, usually denoted as R0 . It refers to the average number of secondary
cases per infectious case in a population where all the individuals thereof are susceptible to
the infection. A variant called the instantaneous reproduction number, denoted as Rt , is the
average number of cases generated by each infection at a given time t. We observe that 33 of 50
continental states in the US has had Rt > 1 (https://rt.live) on 05/29/2020, suggesting that
the epidemic has not yet been fully contained by the end of May, 2020. In fact, this proportion
climbs to 41 out of 50 in the following month. Upon the end of the study period, the proportion
of the states with Rt > 1 has dropped to 16 out of 50, but the whole nation is still faced with
the potential risk of a massive spread owing to the reopening of schools in the fall. Some other
results of critical epidemic characteristics and dynamics of the COVID-19 in the US have been
reported in [54].
In this study, we treat the collected data as functional data, and adopt methods from the
functional data analysis (FDA). Figure 2 shows the functional data of daily confirmed and death
cases (per million) of the top five states in the US during the study period. As discussed in [58],
the FDA methods are applicable to sparsely and irregularly spaced data in time, so are preferred
to the standard time series methods in the analyses of the time series data. Besides, the FDA
methods manage to capture the functional behavior of the underlying data which generate the
process (see [57, 58, 59] for details), and have been widely adopted in a plethora of applications
in public health and biomedical studies [70]. In the next few sections, we list the adopted FDA
methods, and present the analysis results when they are applied to the COVID-19 data in the
US.

3. Functional principal component analysis and modes of variation
In multivariate statistics, modes of variation are a set of centered vectors describing the
variation in a population or sample. Typically, variation patterns are characterized via the
standard eigenanalysis, i.e., principal component analysis [37]. Analogously in the FDA, modes
of variation provide an efficient tool to visualize the variation of the functional curves around
the mean function. Identifying modes of variation in functional data is usually done through the
functional principal component analysis [14], providing new insights and precise interpretations
of the functional data.
3.1. Functional principal component analysis. Consider a probability space (R+ , F, P),
and a compact interval I ⊂ R+ . A stochastic process X(·) is called an L2 process on I if
Z
E |X(t)|2 dt < ∞.
I

Let Xi , for i = 1, 2, . . . , n, be independent realizations of the underlying L2 process X(·). By
convention in the FDA, functional data are given as
Yi (t) = Xi (t) + εi (t),

(1)

for t ∈ Ti := {tij , j = 1, 2, . . . , ni }, a time schedule for subject i. The terms εi (tij )’s are
2 for some constant
independent measurement errors with E(εi (tij )) = 0 and Var(εi (tij )) = σij
σij .
The functional principal component analysis (FPCA) is a powerful tool for dimension reduction in the FDA [14]. In essence, FPCA is an expansion of the realization Xi (t) into functional
bases consisting of the eigenfunctions of the variance-covariance structure of the process X(·),
where the eigenfunctions are required to be orthogonal. Let {φk : k ≥ 1} denotes the collection
of orthogonal
eigenfunctions. In addition, let µ(t) = E(X(t)) be the true mean function, and
R
ξik := I (Xi (t) − µ(t))φk (t) dt be the k-th functional principal component (FPC) of Xi (also

Due to the difficulties in estimating and interpreting the infinite sum in Equation (2), a conventional treatment is to approximate it by a finite sum of K terms. In what follows, we set

where υi (t) is the counterpart of εi (t) in Equation (1) owing to truncation. We refer interested
readers to [64] for a comprehensive review of the fundamental theory of FPCA. One primary
application of FPCA is to explore modes of variation [39] for the functional data, reflecting the
percentage of total variations contributed by each principal eigenfunctions.
When applying the FPCA method to the COVID-19 data of the 50 continental states in
the US, we notice that they are not identical in time schedules. The identification of the first
COVID-19 case may differ by as long as 30 days across the country. Having observed the sparsity
in the functional data during the early stage of the outbreak, we adopt the Principal Components
Analysis through Conditional Expectation (PACE) approach proposed in [73] for our analysis.
The estimation of the FPC score of Yi = (Yi (ti1 ), . . . , Yi (tini ))T , for i = 1, 2, . . . n, via PACE
takes the following major steps:
(1) For each Yi , estimate the mean function µi = (µ(ti1 ), . . . , µ(tini ))T and the covariance
structure ΣYi = Cov(Yi , Yi ) by locally linear scatter and surface smoothers, respectively [16];
(2) Discretize the off-diagonal smoothed covariance to estimate the eigenfunctions φik =
(φk (ti1 ), . . . , φk (tini ))Tc , k = 1, 2, . . . K, and the corresponding eigenvalue λk [6];

(3) Adopt an Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) type criterion to select the number of
eigenfunctions, i.e., K, needed to approximate the process [62];
(4) Lastly, the estimation of the FPC score for the i-th subject is given through the conditional expectation:
−1
ξˆik = E(ξik | Yi ) = λ̂k φ̂T
ik Σ̂Yi (Yi − µ̂i ),

(3)

where λ̂k , φ̂ik , Σ̂Yi and µ̂i are respectively the estimates of λk , φik , ΣYi and µi .
In practice, the R package fdapace [7] allows us to apply the PACE method to the functional
COVID-19 data directly. The computation results and corresponding discussions are given in
the subsequent section.
3.2. Modes of variation. To begin with, we plot the fitted mean curve (which estimates the
trend over time), the fitted variance curve (which estimates the subject-specific variation) and
the fitted covariance surface of daily confirmed cases across 50 continental states in Figure 3.
The estimated mean is close to 0 in January and February, and starts climbing since early
March until reaches a local maximum in late April. The overall trend in May is downwards,
followed by a second wave that starts from June. The curve hits the peak at the end of the third
week of July. The estimated variance curve looks similar to the fitted mean curve in shape, which
stays low at the very early stage, and deviates from 0 at the end of the first week of March. The
first local maximum emerges around 04/17/2020, and then starts decreasing until 06/01/2020.
The global maximum of the curve is observed in the third week of July, corresponding to the
worst period of the attack of the COVID-19 to the country. The correlation surface is presented
through a contour plot. Measurements at close time points appears to be highly correlated. The
correlation between early and very late times are close to 0, whereas that between early and
middle times tends to be negative. The correlation patterns among middle and later times are
slightly negative. In particular, the correlation surface reveals that the increase in the number of

6

confirmed cases follows three different stages, where the two break points are respectively 03/01
and 06/01. The strong positive correlation seems more persistent in the latter two stages.
Next we apply the PACE method to the COVID-19 data of daily confirmed cases in the US.
The adaptive algorithm selects a total of six eigenfunctions (accounting for more than 99.99%
of the total variation), where the first two together explains about 95% of the total variation of
the data (see Figure 4), indicating the remaining eigenfunctions are less important.
The first eigenfunction (accounting for 68.38% of the total variation) remains constant close
to 0 during the first month of the study period, and starts decreasing afterwards. The value
of the eigenfunction falls negative since 03/01/2020 until it reaches a local minimum around
04/17/2020. After that, the function value keeps increasing until it hits the peak around
07/23/2020. The first eigenfunction defines the most important mode of variation, suggesting
that the state-specific intercept term captures the vertical shift (especially later times) in the
overall mean. Besides, the first eigenfunction reflects a contrast between middle and late times,
where the break point emerges about one week after the announcement of business reopening
in the majority of the states in the US.

The second eigenfunction presents a variation around a piecewise linear time trend. The value
of the eigenfunction is negative at early times, and becomes positive since March, and hits a
break point in the third week of April. Since then, it begins to decrease but stays positive during
the rest of the study period. The second eigenfunction suggests that the second largest variation
among the states is a scale difference along the direction of this functional curve.
4. Functional canonical correlations
In statistics, canonical correlation analysis is a tool to make inference based on the crosscovariance matrix of multiple datasets. The analogue in FDA, named functional canonical
correlation analysis (FCCA), aims to investigate the correlation shared by multiple functional
datasets [44]. Specifically, here we use the FCCA method to quantitatively estimate the correlation between confirmed and death cases across the states.

7

4.1. Functional canonical correlation analysis. We first outline the theoretical setup of the
analysis method [22, 23], and refer the interested readers to [71] for a concise review. Let X(·)
and Y (·) be two L2 processes on two compact intervals, IX and IY , respectively. In addition, let
H2 (I) denote the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions on some compact interval I, with
respect to Lebesgue measure. In addition, the notation h·, ·i refers to the standard operation of
inner product. By definition, the first canonical correlation is given by


ρ1 =
sup
Cov hu, Xi, hv, Y i = Cov hu1 , Xi, hv1 , Y i ,
u∈H2 (IX ),v∈H2 (IY )

subject to

Var hu, Xi = 1


Var hv, Y i = 1.

and

(4)

The pair of the optimal solutions (u1 , v1 ) are called the canonical weight functions of ρ1 . For
k ≥ 2, the k-th canonical correlation coefficient, denoted ρk , is defined under the condition of
orthogonality:


Cov huk , Xi, huj , Xi = Cov hvk , Y i, hvj , Y i = 0,
j = 1, 2, . . . , k − 1.
Set ρk , k ≥ 2, and its associated weight functions (uk , vk ) in an analogous way:


ρk =
sup
Cov hu, Xi, hv, Y i = Cov huk , Xi, hvk , Y i ,
u∈H2 (IX ),v∈H2 (IY )

subject to condition (4). In FDA, the inner products hu, Xi and hv, Y i corresponding to weight
functions u and v are called probe scores. Typically for k ≥ 1, we refer to (uk , vk ) as the canonical
weight pair that optimizes the canonical criteria for ρk .
The FCCA approach, in essence, determines the projection of X in the direction of uk as well
as that of Y in the direction of vk , such that their linear combinations are maximized for k ≥ 1.
Consider three kinds of variance and cross-covariance operators ΣXX : H2 (X) 7→ H2 (X), ΣY Y :
H2 (Y ) 7→ H2 (Y ) and ΣY X : H2 (Y ) 7→ H2 (X), which correspond to the variance structure of X,
the variance structure of Y and the cross-covariance structure between X and Y , respectively.
We then rewrite the definition expression of ρ1 as follows:
ρ1 =

sup

hu, ΣY X vi,

(5)

u∈H2 (IX ),v∈H2 (IY )

subject to u> ΣXX u = v > ΣY Y v = 1. Similar arguments can also be applied to ρk , k ≥ 2, by
accounting for the condition of orthogonality. A standard procedure for the change of basis in
−1/2
−1/2
Equation (5) implies that the problem is equivalent to an eigenanalysis of ΣXX ΣY X ΣY Y , i.e.,
a maximization problem of Rayleigh quotient.
In this study, we use functions from the R package fda [60] to implement the FCCA method
based on an integration of an exceedingly greedy procedure and an expansion of the functional
basis. A variety of methods solving the optimization problem of functional canonical correlations
have been developed in the literature; see for example, [59, 22, 23, 72].
Prior to estimating the functional canonical correlation between confirmed cases and death
tolls in the US, some additional pre-processing procedures to the data are necessary, as we
observe that the date on which the first confirmed case is reported varies significantly across the
states, and the number of death counts stays relatively low during the entire study period in
several states.
4.2. Canonical correlations between confirmed and death cases. Now we inspect the
functional canonical correlation between confirmed and death cases from the 50 continental
states in the US. The first step is to pre-process the data. Noticing that diagnostic tests (e.g.,
swab test) of the COVID-19 have not been widely implemented in most states until late March
(for instance, the first drive-through COVID-19 testing site in Philadelphia was not open to the
public until 03/20/2020), we reschedule the starting date of study period to 04/01/2020 for the
rest of the study in this section. Besides, the cumulative number of (scaled) confirmed and death
cases (instead of scaled daily numbers) are used for the analysis so that no state is excluded due
to sparsity, especially for those with few cases reported during April and early May.

8

In the literature, there are several different options of basis functions for the basis expansion
in the FCCA. Having observed some periodic features in our functional data, we choose the
Fourier basis here. The first canonical correlation is 0.985, which reveals a dominant pair of
modes of variation that are highly positively correlated. The corresponding canonical weight
functions are plotted in Figure 5. The canonical weight function of confirmed cases resembles a
sinusoidal function with a period of one month approximately, while the counterpart of death
cases seemingly contrasts early and middle times to late times (primarily in July). A state has
a negative score with a large absolute value on the canonical weight of confirmed cases if it has
a large number of confirmed cases in April, late May and early June, but small counts in July
and early August. Also, a state has a high positive score on the canonical weight of death cases
if it has more death cases in July than any other time during the study period.

Figure 5. The first pair of canonical weight functions correlating confirmed and
death cases of the 50 continental states in the US.
Next we plot the canonical variable scores for the death cases against confirmed cases in
Figure 6, where we see that the New York state lies on the bottom left corner. This is due
to the fact that the New York state (especially New York City) has a lot of confirmed and
death cases at the early stage of the pandemic, but later the transmission of the virus has been
well controlled since July, thanks to the complete shutdown of the city as well as the rigorous
adherence to public health measures, e.g. the practice of social distancing, mask wearing and
the limit of the number of people allowed in essential businesses. Since July, less than 20 deaths
has been reported daily in New York City, in contrast with an average of more than 700 deaths
every day in April. Therefore, both canonical variable scores remain low in the state of New
York.
Another “outlier” is New Jersey, which is geographically adjacent to New York state. The
overall trends of confirmed and death cases in New Jersey are similar in shape to those in
New York, but both are smaller in magnitude. Therefore, New Jersey sits close to New York
in Figure 6. Three states in the middle with negative scores in both canonical variables are
Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island, all of which are geographically close to New
York.

9

All other states are mostly scattered on the top right corner in Figure 6. The one sits at
the most top right is Texas, with positive scores in both canonical variables. The confirmed
and death cases in Texas are not the largest in the first wave of outbreak (i.e., April and May),
but the state has seen a large surge in the daily confirmed and death cases since late June.
Consequently, both of the canonical scores of Texas remain positive. In fact, Texas has controlled
the spread of the disease well in April when a 14-day self-quarantine has been mandated, all
nonessential businesses are closed, and ordered travel restrictions have been instituted between
Texas and Louisiana (an outbreak occurs in New Orleans during that period). However, with
the stay-at-home order lapsed in May, and the reopening of the economy started in June, Texas
has experienced a huge increase in the COVID-19 cases, due to the increasing frequencies of
indoor and outdoor gatherings in large groups of people without proper public health measures
implemented.

5. Functional cluster analysis
Clustering is another common tool for data exploration in multivariate statistics, aiming
at constructing homogeneous groups (called clusters) consisting of observed data that present
some similar characteristics or patterns [41]. In contrast, observations from different groups are
expected to be as dissimilar as possible. The functional cluster analysis (FCA) is an unsupervised
learning process for functional data. In this section, we investigate the cluster structure in the
US based on cumulative confirmed cases (after being scaled) across the states.
5.1. Methods for functional cluster analysis. Two classical methods for the FCA are hierarchical clustering [17] and k-means clustering [2]. More recently, many clustering methods
extended from them were proposed. See [35] for a summary.
Traditional k-means clustering methods for the FCA, e.g. [2], require a finite set of prespecified basis functions in order to span a functional space, and assume the observed functional
data to admit the basis expansion. The FCA is then completed by applying the standard k-means

10

algorithm to the estimated basis coefficients. Alternatively, one may replace basis coefficients
with FPC scores (i.e., ξik ’s in Equation (3)) for conducting the cluster analysis [10, 11, 55].
In modern FDA, there are two methods that are extensively popular to conduct the FCA.
One approach is the EM-based algorithm [9], which assumes a finite (say K ∈ N) mixture of
Gaussian distributions. The model is given by

1, 2, . . . , K, πc ∈ (0, 1) is the mixing proportion such that K
c=1 πc = 1, and ψ(x | µc , Σc ) is
a Gaussian distribution with mean µc and variance Σc . The log-likelihood of the model in
Equation (6) is optimized by the EM algorithm [15]. The setups of the E-step and the M-step
are standard, available in a variety of articles, texts and tutorials, e.g. [43]. Given the number
of clusters K, the EM algorithm partitions a set of n observations X = {x1 , . . . , xn } into K
clusters by maximizing the following expression:
arg max π̂c φ(xi | µ̂c , Σ̂c )
c

for each i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
The alternative is the k-centers functional clustering (kCFC) algorithm proposed by [10],
using the subspace spanned by the FPCs as cluster centers. This approach is popular as the
distributional assumptions are relaxed.
Nonetheless, there are limitations in both algorithms. The kCFC algorithm assumes equal
within-cluster variance, whereas the EM algorithm assumes a mixture of Gaussian distributions.
Relevant discussions on the difference between the two algorithms are included in [35]. In the
present analysis, it seems inappropriate to assume equal within-cluster variance, so we adopt
the model-based EM algorithm, which is available in R package EMCluster [9]. Since the
method is based on the EM algorithm, it is critical to select the initial values of the parameters
appropriately. Specifically, we adopt a strategy developed in [5] for the initialization of the
algorithm, with corresponding functions available in EMCluster.
5.2. Cluster analysis results. Similar to the FCCA part, we trim the study period to “04/01/2020
to 08/15/2020” as few (or even no) confirmed case has been observed in many states before April.
The implementation of the EMCluster algorithm requires the predetermination of the number
of clusters in prior. There are a couple of standard methods to obtain an optimal value of K.
We select the value of K via the elbow method based on the sum of squares of the within-cluster
variations. The computation reveals that the most appropriate value of K is 5, and the optimal
clustering strategy associated with K = 5 is given in Figure 7.
The first cluster includes New York, New Jersey and Illinois, the three states that have
been most severely attacked by the COVID-19 in the first wave, as well as Florida, Texas and
California, all of which have experienced a huge surge in both confirmed and death cases in the
second wave. Overall, these six states are the worst hit by the COVID-19 throughout the study
period.
The second cluster contains 24 states, including Georgia, North Carolina, Massachusetts,
Pennsylvania and Washington, etc., most of which are geographically close (but not necessarily
adjacent) to the hot-spot regions. Some states, e.g. Georgia, North Carolina and Colorado,
actually have reached the peak of the COVID-19 cases in the second wave after the reopening of
the business, when some mandatory protocols have been called off. Besides, with the relaxation
of travel restrictions, an increase in population movements may also cause the cross infections
among the residents in these states. The state of Washington, located at the northwest corner,
also belongs to this cluster, where the first case in the US has been reported.
The third cluster only has two states: Utah and Arkansas. Utah is not directly adjacent those
epidemic centers specified in the first cluster. The control of the COVID-19 remains reasonably
well in Utah, and we speculate some possible reasons as follows. Though there is no evidence
that youngsters are not likely to be infected, they are likely to have stronger immune systems

(than elders). Utah has the lowest percentage of residents above 65 in the nation. Besides, Utah
is among the healthiest states in the nation overall (https://www.americashealthrankings.
org). The attack of the COVID-19 to the other state in the third cluster, Arkansas, has also been
less serious during the second wave, although it is right next to Texas. The local government
has maintained a series of policies that help reduce the spread of the disease, for example, the
delay of school opening.
The fourth cluster contains Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska and Kentucky, where the major
industries are agriculture, core mining, and aviation, etc. Besides, there are not too many
tourist resorts in these states triggering large population movements. It is also necessary to note
that the population densities are relatively small in these states. Hence, they are less affected
by the COVID-19 compared to those in the first three clusters.
Lastly, a total of 14 states are classified in the fifth cluster, including Vermont, New Mexico,
Alaska, Montana, and Wyoming, etc. These states are the least attacked by the virus. Although
the data has been scaled, most of these states are large in their geographical sizes, leading to
low population densities. In fact, among all 50 states, Alaska, Montana and Wyoming have the
three lowest population densities in the nation.
For comparison, we also conduct an analogous analysis on a truncated study period from
04/01/2020 to 05/15/2020, around which business reopening starts over a large number of
states. The clustering results are presented in Figure 8, and the cluster structure appears to be
greatly different from that given in Figure 7. Essentially, the New York state and its neighbors
are the epidemic centers for the period from 04/01/2020 to 05/15/2020, and the alterations in
the cluster membership flag the significant impacts of reopening the business in accelerating the
spread of the virus.
6. Forecasting
When forecasting the COVID-19 data using functional data approaches, we need to preserve
the temporal dynamics among curves to maintain the forecasting ability, which leads us to the
context of functional time series [FTS, 26].

6.1. Converting data into FTS. An FTS consists of a set of random functions collected over
time. So far in the literature, there are two common formations of an FTS object. One treats an
FTS as a segmentation of an almost continuous time record into natural consecutive intervals,
such as days, months, or quarters. This is a conventional treatment for financial data [27]. The
other treats it as a collection of curves over a time period, where the curves are not functions
of time; see [12] for example. The major difference between these two formations is whether
the continuum of each function is a time variable. In this section, we start with the number of
nationwide cumulative confirmed cases of the COVID-19 in the US, where we define and convert
the FTS using the first convention outlined above. Based on several reports on the COVID-19
pandemic [49, 76], the average incubation period of the coronavirus is about 7 days, but the
incubation period could last up to 14 days for most of the cases. Therefore, we segment the
number of cumulative confirmed cases into curves with time intervals of 14 days. In line with
the conventional treatment that segments a continuous curve into small intervals, we set the last
value in one curve equal to the first value of the next.
Similar to the classical time series modeling, it is critical to appropriately handle the nonstationary data when modeling the FTS. To circumvent the issue of the non-stationarity in
the COVID-19 data, we exploit the ideas from the literature dealing with FTS of share prices.
In [18], the authors define the cumulative intraday returns (CIDR’s), and later in [30], a formal
test that justifies the stationarity of CIDR’s curves has been developed. Here we convert the
non-stationary cumulative confirmed case counts into stationary curves by calculating the daily
growth rate in each curve:


rn,j = 100 × ln Cn,j − ln Cn,j−1 ,
(7)
where Cn,j denotes the number of confirmed cases on the j-th day of the n-th segment, for
j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 14}, and n ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N }. Let rn (t) be the daily growth rates curve of the n-th
segment, but values can only be observed at discrete time points j, such that rn,j = rn (tj ).
Under the functional data framework, we assume the neighboring grid points are highly
correlated, and smoothing serves as a tool for regularization, such that we borrow information

13

from the neighboring grid points [71]. When applying to the daily growth rate for the cumulative
confirmed cases, we assume that the underlying continuous and smooth function Yn (t) is observed
at discrete points with smoothing error n (tj ):
rn (tj ) = Yn (tj ) + n (tj );

see [31] for details on smoothing. After applying the test from [30], we find that the p-value is
equal to 0.989, suggesting the stationarity of the FTS with respect to the daily growth rates.
The rainbow plot proposed in [33] is effective in the visualization of the FTS. In a rainbow plot,
functions that are ordered in time and colored with a spectrum of rainbow, such that functions
from earlier times are colored in red, while the most recent ones are in violet. The rainbow plot
captures the features of an FTS in two ways. Within each curve, the mode of variation reflects
the pattern of the curve, and the ordering in color reveals the temporal dynamics over time.

Figure 9. Functional time series for unsmoothed (left panel) and smoothed
(right panel) growth rates of the cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the
US.
Figure 9 presents the rainbow plot of both unsmoothed (left) and smoothed (right) growth
rates of the cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the US from 04/04/2020 to 08/25/2020,
leading to exactly 11 functional curves. From Figure 9, we observe that all the curves share
a similar temporal pattern, where the growth rate increases rapidly within the first four days,
and then tapers off gradually. This coincides with a scientific finding that an infected person
is most contagious early in the course of their illness [68]. Based on the color ordering in the
rainbow plot, we see that the growth rate declines gradually from April to June, indicating the
effectiveness of the practice of public health measures (including lock down policies implemented
at the early stage of the outbreak), but it bounces back up again in July, flagging the effects of
reopening.
In the rest of this section, we develop a forecasting scheme by considering a dynamic FPCA
method that accounts for the temporal dynamics of the long-run covariance structure of the
FTS. The forecasting is done through the dynamic FPCA scores. We use the root mean squared
forecasting error and a nonparametric bootstrap approach to assess the accuracy of point and
interval forecasts, respectively. We then apply the proposed scheme to forecast the number of
confirmed cases in the US in the next 13 days (the first day of the 14-day prediction segment
coincides with the last day of the study period).
6.2. Dynamic FPCA. The major critics of classical FPCA (c.f. Section 3.1) stem from its incapability of making forecasts as it only aims to reduce the dimension of data by maximizing the
variances explained by eigenfunctions. The dynamic FPCA, however, manages to reduce dimension towards the directions mostly reflecting temporal dynamics [28]. To better accommodate
the need of capturing the temporal dynamics among the FTS and making better forecast, we

14

here adopt the dynamic FPCA method [28]. The primary difference between classical and dynamic FPCA is that in performing the eigenanalysis, we replace the variance-covariance function
with the long-run covariance function.
For an FTS, the long-run covariance function, which is the functional analogue of the long-run
covariance matrix in standard time series analysis, plays an important role in accommodating
the temporal dependence among functions. We now give the definition of long-run covariance
function. Let {Yi (τ ), i ∈ Z} denote a sequence of stationary and ergodic functional time series,
with τ being a bounded continuous variable. The long-run covariance function of {Yi (τ ), i ∈ Z}
is given by
∞
X
C(s, t) :=
γi (s, t),
i=−∞

where γi (s, t) = Cov(Y0 (s), Yi (t)). In practice, we need to estimate C(s, t) via a finite sample,
i.e. {Yi (τ ), i = 1, 2, . . . , n} for some integer n < ∞. We use the lag-window estimator proposed
by [53] to estimate the long-run covariance function C(s, t):
 
∞
X
i

C(s, t) :=
K
γ
bi (s, t),

h
i=−∞

where K(i/h) is a kernel function assigning different weights to the auto-covariance functions
with different lags, and the parameter h is the bandwidth [3]. Typically, we assign more weights
to the autocovariance functions of small lags and fewer to those of large lags. Here we use the
“flat-top” type of kernels, as they provide smaller bias and faster rates of convergence [56]. For
k < 1, the flat-top kernel is given by

|i/h| ≥ 1.
The selection of the bandwidth crucially affects the accuracy of estimation. Here we adopt
an adaptive bandwidth selection procedure [61] to get an approximately optimal bandwidth for
the subsequent estimation of the long-run covariance of FTS. The estimator γ
bi (s, t) is given by

The dynamic FPCA is done through the Karhunen-Loève expansion exactly the same as Equation (2), but the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are estimated based on the eigenanalysis of

6.3. Forecasting based on scores. We use m functional observations to get an `-step-ahead
forecast by the method developed in [32]. Note that applying a univariate time series forecasting
(m)
method to the score vector ξbk = {ξb1k , ξb2k . . . , ξbmk } gives the estimated ξbm+` | m,k , then the
estimate of the `-step-ahead forecast is given by
Ybm+` | m (t) = µ
b(t) +

X

ξbm+` | m,k φbk (t),

k=1

where µ
b(t) and {φbk (t), k = 1, 2, . . . , K} denote the estimated mean and FPCs, respectively.
For the application to the COVID-19 data, we forecast the daily number of the cumulative
confirmed cases by the grid points on the forecasting curve. Without loss of generality, we
consider the one-step-ahead forecast (i.e., ` = 1). Note that this procedure generates daily
forecasts up to 13 days, since by our assumption on the FTS conversion in Section 6.1, the first
grid point on the curve is the same as that on the last day of the study period. By implementing
the FTS converting procedures from 6.1, we obtain an FTS object consisting of 11 functional
curves. We create an expanding window analysis framework, and apply the proposed forecasting

15

method to get multiple one-step-ahead forecasts on the growth rate curve. The details are
deferred to Section 6.4.1.
6.4. Forecast accuracy evaluation. In this section, we introduce the methods that assess
the prediction accuracy for point and interval forecasts. To make forecast for the number of
confirmed cases in the US in the next 13 days, we set ` = 1 throughout the section.
6.4.1. Point forecast. For a point forecast, We use the root mean square forecast error (RMSFE)
to evaluate its accuracy:
v
u
−1 h
i2
u 1 NX
bm+1 (j) ,
RMSFE(j) = t
Cm+1 (j) − C
(9)
N − n m=n
where N is the total number of segments in the FTS, m is the number of curves used in
forecasting, Cm+1 (j) is the number of confirmed cases at the j-th point on the (m + 1)-th curve,
bm+1 (j) is the corresponding forecast value. The RMSFE measures the discrepancy between
and C
the forecast and the actual value.
Given that there are 11 functional curves in the study period, we start with the first n = 8
curves to generate one-step-ahead point forecasts, and repeat this forecasting procedure by
adding one curve at a time until the first 10 curves are included, which gives us (N − n = 3)
one-step-ahead forecasts in total. In other words, for each time point j, there are three forecast
values. We choose n = 8 as our starting point to ensure that an adequate number of curves are
used for forecasting.
We adopt a standard forecasting approach through the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model as a competing method. The forecasting results are presented in Figure 10,
where the y-axis is the average of the RMSFE (scaled by 10) of the three one-step-ahead point
forecasts. We observe that the mean values of the RMSFE of FTS forecasts are consistently
smaller than the counterparts of standard ARIMA, suggesting that the proposed FTS method
is preferred.

to the assumption in Section 6.1 that the first day of the 14-day prediction
segment coincides with the last day of the study period.

6.4.2. Interval forecast. To better capture the uncertainty of point forecasts, we construct the
associated prediction intervals in this section. In [4], uniform prediction intervals are generated
using a parametric method, and later [66] suggests constructing pointwise prediction intervals
via a nonparametric bootstrap method. The construction of the prediction intervals is based
bm+1 (j). Specifically, we generate a
on in-sample-forecast errors, i.e., ebm+1 | m (j) = Cm+1 (j) − C
bootstrap sample (with replacement) of forecasting errors to obtain the upper and lower bounds,
respectively denoted by η ub (j) and η up (j). Then we choose a tuning parameter, δα , such that
n
o
P δα × η lb (j) ≤ ebm+1 | m ≤ δα × η ub (j) = (1 − α) × 100%.
The one-step-ahead (pointwise) prediction interval is given by
bm+1 (j) + δα × η lb (j) ≤ Cm+1 (j) ≤ C
bm+1 (j) + δα × η ub (j).

We use the interval scoring rules [19] to evaluate the accuracy of the pointwise interval forecasts. The interval score for the pointwise interval forecast (c.f. Equation (10)) at time point j
is given by

Figure 11 shows the mean interval scores (scaled by 10) of the interval forecasts obtained from
the FTS model versus the standard ARIMA model. The computation results reveal that the
proposed FTS method outperforms the standard ARIMA.
6.4.3. Future forecasts. We apply the proposed method to forecast the number of cumulative
confirmed cases in the next 13 days upon the last date of study period. Table 1 shows the
predicted number and 80% confidence interval of nationwide cumulative confirmed cases (in
thousands). In addition, the point forecasts and the associated 80% confidence bands for the
cumulative confirmed cases in the US from 08/26/2020 to 09/07/2020 are depicted in Figure 12,
where we also compare the prediction results with those generated from an ARIMA model.
From Table 1, we see that our FTS forecasts tends to slightly underestimate the total counts,
but the actual count still falls within the prediction intervals. Such deviation may be due to
the reopening of the schools starting from mid-August, leading to the surge in the cumulative
confirmed cases nationwide. When comparing the FTS forecasting results with the ARIMA
model in Figure 12, we see a narrower prediction interval for the FTS results, suggesting that it
is preferred than the standard ARIMA model.
7. Discussions
In this article, we conduct a functional data analysis of the time series data of COVID-19
in the US. Based on our results, it is evident that the practice of public health measures (e.g.
“stay-at-home” order and mask wearing) helps reduce the growth rate of the epidemic outbreak
over the nation. However, the implementation of the business reopening plans seems to have
caused the rapid spread of the COVID-19 in some states, e.g. Texas and Florida.
We quantitatively assess the correlation between confirmed and death cases using the FCCA.
Overall, we observe a high canonical correlation between confirmed and death cases, though the

canonical variable scores vary from state to state. With the population size in each state carefully
adjusted, we see that there is a substantial change in the cluster structure in the early and late
times, and 05/15/2020 (the average date of business reopening across the states) appears to be
a potential change point. Besides, states that are geographically close to the hot spots are likely
to be clustered together, and population density (at state level) appears to be a critical factor
affecting the cluster structure.
In addition, we also propose a forecasting scheme for the nationwide cumulative confirmed
cases under the functional time series framework. Integrating information from the neighboring
data point, the forecasting accuracy from the functional time series approach outperforms that
from an ARIMA model. Forecasts are also made to the next 13 days of the study period, and
comparisons with the actual counts are provided. Although our method tends to produce smaller
estimated counts for the next 13 days, the actual values still fall within the prediction intervals
associated with our forecasts. It is also worthwhile noticing that such underestimation may
indicate the effects of school reopening in accelerating the spread of the virus over the country.
